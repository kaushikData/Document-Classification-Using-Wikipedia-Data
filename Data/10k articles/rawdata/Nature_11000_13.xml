The red line is the density profile, black line is temperature, and the blue line is salinity.  One mixed layer depth, D&lt;sub&gt;T-02&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as the depth at which the surface temperature cools by 0.2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C (black dashed line).  The density defined mixed layer, D&lt;sub&gt;sigma&lt;/sub&gt;, is 40 m (red dashed line) and is defined as the surface density plus the density difference brought about by the temperature increment of 0.2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.   Above D&lt;sub&gt;sigma&lt;/sub&gt; the water is both isothermal and isohaline.  The difference between D&lt;sub&gt;T-02&lt;/sub&gt; minus D&lt;sub&gt;sigma&lt;/sub&gt; is the barrier layer thickness (blue arrows on the figure) [http://www.lodyc.jussieu.fr/~cdblod/blt.html].  &lt;/center&gt;
}}

The '''Barrier layer''' in the ocean is a layer of water separating the well-mixed surface layer from the [[Thermocline#oceanography|thermocline]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprintall, J., and M. Tomczak, Evidence of the barrier layer in the surface-layer of the tropics, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 97 (C5), 7305-7316, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barrier layer thickness (BLT)==
The thickness of the barrier layer is defined as  the difference between [[Mixed layer#Oceanic mixed layer formation|mixed layer depth]] (MLD) calculated from temperature minus the mixed layer depth calculated using density.   The first reference to this difference as the barrier layer was in a paper describing observations in the western Pacific as part of the [[Western Equatorial Pacific Ocean Circulation Study]].&lt;ref&gt;Lukas, R., and E. Lindstrom, The Mixed Layer of the Western Equatorial Pacific-Ocean, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 96, 3343-3357, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  In regions where the barrier layer is present, [[stratification (water)|stratification]] is stable because of strong [[buoyancy]] forcing associated with a fresh lens sitting on top of the water column. 
 
In the past, a typical criterion for MLD was the depth at which the surface temperature cools by 0.2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C (see e.g. D&lt;sub&gt;T-02&lt;/sub&gt; in the Figure).  Prior to the subsurface salinity available from [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo]], this was the main methodology for calculating the oceanic MLD.  More recently, a density criterion has been used to define the MLD, defined as the depth where the density increases from the surface value due to a prescribed temperature decrease of 0.2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C from the surface value while maintaining constant surface salinity value.   In the Figure, this is defined by D&lt;sub&gt;sigma&lt;/sub&gt; and corresponds to an isothermal/isohaline layer.   The BLT is the difference of the temperature-defined MLD minus the density-defined value (i.e. D&lt;sub&gt;T-02&lt;/sub&gt; - D&lt;sub&gt;sigma&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== BLT Regimes ===

Large values of the BLT are typically found in the equatorial regions and can be as high as 50 m.  Above the barrier layer, the well mixed layer may be due to local precipitation exceeding evaporation (e.g. in the western Pacific), monsoon related river runoff (e.g. in the northern Indian Ocean), or [[Advection#Meteorology|advection]] of salty water subducted in the subtropics (found in all subtropical [[ocean gyre]]s).  BLT formation in the subtropics is associated with seasonal change in the mixed layer depth, a sharper gradient in sea surface salinity (SSS) than normal, and subduction across this SSS front.&lt;ref&gt;Sato, K., T. Suga, and K. Hanawa, Barrier layers in the subtropical gyres of the world's oceans, Geophysical Research Letters, 33 (8), 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;    In particular, BLT is formed in winter season in the equatorward flank of subtropical salinity maxima.  During early winter, the atmosphere cools the surface and strong wind and negative buoyancy forcing mixes temperature to a deep layer.  At this same time, fresh surface salinity is advected from the rainy regions in the tropics.  The deep temperature layer along with strong stratification in the salinity gives the conditions for BLT formation.&lt;ref name="Mignot"&gt;Mignot, J., C.d.B. Montegut, A. Lazar, and S. Cravatte, Control of salinity on the mixed layer depth in the world ocean: 2. Tropical areas, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 112 (C10), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
For the western Pacific, the mechanism for BLT formation is different.  Along the equator, the eastern edge of the warm pool (typically 28&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C isotherm - see [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Weeklysst.gif SST plot] in the western Pacific) is a demarcation region between warm fresh water to the west and cold, salty, [[Upwelling#Equatorial|upwelled]] water in the central Pacific.  A barrier layer is formed in the isothermal layer when salty water is subducted from the east into the warm pool due to local convergence and warm fresh water overrides denser water to the east.  Here, weak winds, heavy precipitation, eastward advection of low salinity water, westward subduction of salty water and downwelling [[Kelvin waves#Equatorial Kelvin wave|equatorial Kelvin]] or [[Rossby wave#Oceanic waves|Rossby waves]] are factors that contribute to deep BLT formation.&lt;ref&gt;Bosc, C., T. Delcroix, and C. Maes, Barrier layer variability in the western Pacific warm pool from 2000 to 2007, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 114, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Significance of BLT ===

Prior to [[El Nino]], the warm pool stores heat and is confined to the far western Pacific.  During the El Nino, the warm pool migrates eastward along with the concomitant precipitation and current anomalies.  The [[Fetch (geography)|fetch]] of the westerlies is increased during this time, reinforcing the event.  Using data from ship of opportunity and Tropical Atmosphere – Ocean (TAO) moorings in the western Pacific, the east and west migration of the warm pool was tracked over 1992-2000 using sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), currents, and subsurface data on conductivity as a function of temperature and depth taken on various research cruises.&lt;ref&gt;Delcroix, T., and M. McPhaden, Interannual sea surface salinity and temperature changes in the western Pacific warm pool during 1992-2000, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 107 (C12), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  This work showed that during westward flow, the BLT in the western Pacific along the equator (138&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;E-145&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;E, 2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;N-2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;S) was between 18 m – 35 m corresponding with warm SST and serving as an efficient storage mechanism for heat.   BLT formation is driven by westward (i.e. converging and subducting) [[ocean currents|currents]] along the equator near the eastern edge of the salinity front that defines the warm pool.  These westward currents are driven by downwelling [[Rossby wave]]s and represent either a westward advection of BLT or a preferential deepening of the deeper thermocline versus the shallower halocline due to Rossby wave dynamics (i.e. these waves favor vertical stretching of the upper water column).  During El Nino, westerly winds drive the warm pool eastward allowing fresh water to ride on top of the local colder/saltier/denser water to the east.  
 
Using coupled, atmospheric/ocean models and tuning the mixing to eliminate BLT for one year prior to El Nino, it was shown that the heat buildup associated with BLT is a requirement for big El Nino.&lt;ref&gt;Maes, C., J. Picaut, and S. Belamari, Importance of the salinity barrier layer for the buildup of El Niño, Journal of Climate, 18 (1), 104-118, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been shown that there is a tight relationship between SSS and SST in the western Pacific and the barrier layer is instrumental in maintaining heat and momentum in the warm pool within the salinity stratified layer.&lt;ref&gt;Maes, C., K. Ando, T. Delcroix, W.S. Kessler, M.J. McPhaden, and D. Roemmich, Observed correlation of surface salinity, temperature and barrier layer at the eastern edge of the western Pacific warm pool, Geophysical Research Letters, 33 (6), 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Later work, including Argo drifters, confirm the relationship between eastward migration of the warm pool during El Nino and BLT heat storage in the western Pacific.&lt;ref name="Mignot" /&gt;   The main impact of BLT is to maintain a shallow mixed layer allowing an enhanced air-sea coupled response.  In addition, the BLT is the key factor in establishing the mean state that is perturbed during El Nino/[[La Nina]] &lt;ref&gt;Maes, C., and S. Belamari, On the Impact of Salinity Barrier Layer on the Pacific Ocean Mean State and ENSO, Sola, 7, 97-100, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carbon Emission Reduction Target''' (CERT) in the United Kingdom (formerly the '''Energy Efficiency Commitment''') is a target imposed on the gas and electricity transporters and suppliers under Section 33BC of the [[Gas Act 1986]] and Section 41A of the [[Electricity Act 1989]], as modified by the [[Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/en2006/2006en19.htm Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525215913/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/en2006/2006en19.htm |date=25 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Energy Efficiency Commitment 1 (2002–2005) program required that all electricity and gas suppliers with 15,000 or more domestic customers must achieve a combined energy saving of 62 [[TWh]] by 2005 by assisting their customers to take energy-efficiency measures in their homes: suppliers had to achieve at least half of their energy savings in households on income-related benefits and tax credits. 

In the second phase of the  Energy Efficiency Commitment (2005–2008) scheme, energy saving targets were raised to 130 TWh suppliers, and here suppliers with at least 50,000 domestic customers (including affiliated licenses) were eligible for an obligation.

The third phase of CERT (previously known as Energy Efficiency Commitment 3) originally ran from 2008 to 2011 and increased the previous targets to 154 MtC. A consultation document was published alongside the [[2007 Energy White Paper]], and responses were invited by 15 August 2007. The new scheme is regulated by Electricity and Gas (Carbon Emissions Reduction) Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/188). In 2009 the UK Government increased the emission reduction target by a further 20% to 185 MtC. In 2010 the Government increased the target to 293 MtC, to be achieved over an extended period running until the end of 2012 (see The Electricity and Gas (Carbon Emissions Reduction) (Amendment) Order 2010: S.I.2010/1958).

From 2013 CERT will be superseded by the [[Energy Company Obligation]] (ECO)

'''Chatterton’s compound''' was an adhesive waterproof [[Electrical insulation|insulating compound]] that was used in early [[submarine telegraph cable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fyCqJ8-BBMAC&amp;pg=PA58 "Submarine Telegraphs: Their History, Construction, and Working, Bright 1898"]&lt;/ref&gt; It was patented in 1859 by John Chatterton and Willoughby Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CwcLAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA198 "The Repertory of Patent Inventions: And Other Discoveries and Improvements"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its constitution is as follows: 
*3 parts [[gutta-percha]]
*1 part [[rosin]]
*1 part [[pine tar|Stockholm tar]]

Chatterton's Compound was also used to stick insulating paper to armatures, for example those on [[Shortt-Synchronome clock|Synchronome]] clocks, which were the most accurate clocks made in the early part of the 20th century.  If the paper appeared to be in bad condition it could be removed by warming up the armature near a flame and replacing it.

Chatterton's Compound was used in the manufacture of pneumatic pipe organs to seal lead tubing into wooden blocks for the pneumatic action, or, particularly in the UK, to affix reed weights to the reed tongues.  It is still used in historical restoration jobs for this purpose but has been replaced with modern materials on more recent builds.

Chatterton's Compound was much used by submarine cable technicians for various purposes around oversea telegraph offices prior to the 1960s; it could be used as an adhesive or in jointing gutta-percha-insulated submarine telegraph cables.  It was available in round black sticks of about 3/4&amp;nbsp;inch diameter which responded to heat from a [[alcohol burner|spirit lamp]].  It was known to telegraph technicians as 'chats'.

In France, the normal black PVC [[Electrical tape|electrical insulating tape]] is often referred to as ''chatterton''.

These zones contract and form [[weather front]]s as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones [[occluded front|occlude]] as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical [[jet stream]].

Weather fronts mark the boundary between two masses of air of different [[temperature]], [[humidity]], and [[density|densities]], and are associated with the most prominent [[meteorological phenomenon|meteorological phenomena]]. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of [[thunderstorm]]s and [[severe weather]], and may on occasion be preceded by [[squall line]]s or [[dry line]]s. Such fronts form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east; [[warm front]]s form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by [[Stratus cloud|stratiform]] [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[fog]]. Warm fronts move [[Geographical pole|poleward]] ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.

[[Tropical cyclogenesis]] describes the process of development of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core.&lt;ref name = "AOML FAQ A7"&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division|title = Frequently Asked Questions: What is an extra-tropical cyclone?|author = Stan Goldenberg|date = 2004-08-13|accessdate = 2007-03-23|url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to [[tornado]] formation.&lt;ref name = "FoN"/&gt; [[Waterspout]]s can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical [[wind shear]].&lt;ref name = "NWS"/&gt; In the Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific oceans, a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a [[hurricane]] (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, [[Huracan]]), in the Indian and south Pacific oceans it is called a cyclone, and in the northwestern Pacific it is called a [[typhoon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A1.html |title=Frequently asked questions|work= Hurricane Research Division }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The growth of instability in the vortices is not universal. For example, the size, intensity, moist-convection, surface evaporation, the value of potential temperature at each potential height can affect the nonlinear evolution of a vortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/03091929.2016.1269897|bibcode = 2017GApFD.111....1R|title = Influence of condensation and latent heat release upon barotropic and baroclinic instabilities of vortices in a rotating shallow water f-plane model| journal=Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics| volume=111| issue=1| pages=1–31|last1 = Rostami|first1 = Masoud| last2=Zeitlin| first2=Vladimir| year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1002/qj.3292|bibcode = 2018QJRMS.144.1450R|title = An improved moist-convective rotating shallow-water model and its application to instabilities of hurricane-like vortices| journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society| volume=144| issue=714| pages=1450|last1 = Rostami|first1 = Masoud| last2=Zeitlin| first2=Vladimir| year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Post-Tropical Cyclone Nuri and Typhoon Haiyan surface analysis.png|thumb|right|Comparison between extratropical and tropical cyclones on surface analysis]]
There are a number of structural characteristics common to all cyclones.  A cyclone is a [[low-pressure area]].&lt;ref name="FAQ eye"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Chris Landsea]] and Sim Aberson|title=Subject: A11) What is the "eye"? How is it formed and maintained ?

Because of the [[Coriolis effect]], the wind flow around a large cyclone is counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Chris Landsea]]|date=2009-02-06|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D3.html|title=Subject: D3) Why do tropical cyclones' winds rotate counterclockwise (clockwise) in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere?|accessdate=2009-12-28|publisher=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Northern Hemisphere, the fastest winds relative to the surface of the  Earth therefore occur on the eastern side of a northward-moving cyclone and on the northern side of a westward-moving one; the opposite occurs in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/askjack/wfaqhur.htm|title=Are the winds on one side of a hurricane faster than on the other side?|work=Ask the Experts: Hurricanes|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=November 11, 2007|accessdate=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to low pressure systems, the wind flow around high pressure systems are clockwise ([[anticyclone|anticyclonic]]) in the northern hemisphere, and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere.

{{main|Cyclogenesis|Tropical cyclogenesis}}
Cyclogenesis is the development or strengthening of cyclonic circulation in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Arc"/&gt; Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes that all result in the development of some sort of cyclone. It can occur at various scales, from the microscale to the synoptic scale.

Extratropical cyclones begin as waves along [[weather fronts]] before occluding later in their life cycle as cold-core systems. However, some intense extratropical cyclones can become warm-core systems when a  [[warm seclusion]] occurs.

Tropical cyclones form as a result of significant convective activity, and are warm core.&lt;ref name = "AOML FAQ A7"/&gt; Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation.&lt;ref name = "FoN"/&gt; [[Waterspout]]s can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical [[wind shear]].&lt;ref name="NWS"&gt;[[National Weather Service]] Key West [https://web.archive.org/web/20050211013703/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/eyw/HTML/spoutweb.htm summary of waterspout types]&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclolysis is the opposite of cyclogenesis, and is the high-pressure system equivalent, which deals with the formation of [[high-pressure area]]s—[[Anticyclogenesis]].&lt;ref name="CyclogenesisDef"&gt;{{cite web |publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|author= Glossary of Meteorology|title=Cyclogenesis |date = June 2000 |url = http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Cyclogenesis |accessdate = 2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A surface low can form in a variety of ways. Topography can create a surface low. [[Mesoscale Convective System|Mesoscale convective systems]] can spawn surface lows that are initially warm core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Raymond D. Menard |author2=J.M. Fritsch |title=A Mesoscale Convective Complex-Generated Inertially Stable Warm Core Vortex|date=June 1989|journal=Monthly Weather Review|pages=1237–1261|volume=117|issue=6|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1989)117&lt;1237:AMCCGI&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1989MWRv..117.1237M   }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disturbance can grow into a wave-like formation along the [[Surface weather analysis|front]] and the low is positioned at the crest. Around the low, the flow becomes cyclonic. This rotational flow moves polar air towards the equator on the west side of the low, while warm air move towards the pole on the east side. A cold front appears on the west side, while a warm front forms on the east side. Usually, the cold front moves at a quicker pace than the warm front and "catches up" with it due to the slow erosion of higher density air mass out ahead of the cyclone. In addition, the higher density air mass sweeping in behind the cyclone strengthens the higher pressure, denser cold air mass. The cold front over takes the warm front, and reduces the length of the warm front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glenn Elert|year=2006|work=The Physics Factbook|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/RachelChu.shtml|title=Density of Air|accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point an [[occluded front]] forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft, which is also known as a [[trowal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=St. Louis University|url=http://www.eas.slu.edu/CIPS/Presentations/Conferences/NWA2002/Snow_NWA_02/tsld003.htm|publisher=[[National Weather Association]]|title=What is a trowal?|accessdate=2010-01-01|date=2004-09-06|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080608235916/http://www.eas.slu.edu/CIPS/Presentations/Conferences/NWA2002/Snow_NWA_02/tsld003.htm |archivedate = June 8, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropical cyclogenesis is the development and strengthening of a [[tropical cyclone]].&lt;ref name="CYCDEF"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nina A. Zaitseva |year=2006 |url=http://nsidc.org/arcticmet/glossary/cyclogenesis.html |title=Definition for Cyclogenesis |publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center |accessdate=2006-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830135741/http://www.nsidc.org/arcticmet/glossary/cyclogenesis.html |archivedate=2006-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms by which tropical cyclogenesis occurs are distinctly different from those that produce mid-[[latitude]] cyclones. Tropical cyclogenesis, the development of a [[Tropical cyclone#Mechanics|warm-core]] cyclone, begins with significant [[convection]] in a favorable atmospheric environment. There are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis: 
# sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thethermograpiclibrary.org/index.php?title=Fichier:Water_cooling.jpg Cyclon in a board]. thethermograpiclibrary.org&lt;/ref&gt; 
# atmospheric instability, 
# high [[humidity]] in the lower to middle levels of the [[troposphere]]
# enough [[Coriolis force]] to develop a low-pressure center
# a preexisting low-level focus or disturbance
# low vertical [[wind shear]].&lt;ref name="A15"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Chris Landsea]] |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html |title=Subject: A15) How do tropical cyclones form ? |publisher=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]] |accessdate=2010-01-01 |date=2009-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827030639/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html |archivedate=2009-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones (at least Category&amp;nbsp;3 intensity on the [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = [[Chris Landsea]]|url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/climvari/table.html|title = Climate Variability table&amp;nbsp;— Tropical Cyclones|publisher = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]]|date=2000-01-04| accessdate =2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following types of cyclones are identifiable in synoptic charts.

===Surface-based types===
{{See also|Low-pressure area}}
There are three main types of surface-based cyclones: [[Extratropical cyclone]]s, [[Subtropical cyclone]]s and [[Tropical cyclone]]s

====Extratropical cyclone====
{{main|Extratropical cyclone}}

An '''extratropical cyclone''' is a [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic scale]] of [[Low-pressure area|low-pressure]] weather system that does not have [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] characteristics, as it is connected with [[Surface weather analysis|fronts]] and horizontal [[gradients]] (rather than vertical) in [[temperature]] and [[dew point]] otherwise known as "baroclinic zones".&lt;ref name="ExtraLessonMillUni"&gt;{{cite web

"Extratropical" is applied to cyclones outside the tropics, in the middle latitudes. These systems may also be described as "mid-latitude cyclones" due to their area of formation, or "post-tropical cyclones" when a tropical cyclone has moved ([[Extratropical cyclone#Extratropical transition|extratropical transition]]) beyond the tropics.&lt;ref name="ExtraLessonMillUni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ExtratropicalPhases"&gt;{{cite web

=====Polar low=====
{{Main|Polar low}}
[[File:Sea of Japan polar low 2009-12-20 0213Z.jpg|thumb|A polar low over the [[Sea of Japan]] in December 2009]]
A '''polar low''' is a small-scale, short-lived atmospheric [[low-pressure area|low-pressure system]] (depression) that is found over the ocean areas poleward of the main [[polar front]] in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Polar lows were first identified on the meteorological satellite imagery that became available in the 1960s, which revealed many small-scale cloud vortices at high latitudes. The most active polar lows are found over certain ice-free maritime areas in or near the Arctic during the winter, such as the Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, Labrador Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Polar lows dissipate rapidly when they make landfall. Antarctic systems tend to be weaker than their northern counterparts since the air-sea temperature differences around the continent are generally smaller {{citation needed|reason=As far as I know, the Arctic and Antarctic oceans are both warmer than the air above, at about the freezing point, and the air over the ocean is generally colder in the Antarctic due to the katabatic winds sweeping off the continent|date=July 2015}}. However, vigorous polar lows can be found over the Southern Ocean. During winter, when cold-core lows with temperatures in the mid-levels of the troposphere reach {{convert|-45|C|F}} move over open waters, deep convection forms, which allows [[polar low]] development to become possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-tBa1DWYoDIC&amp;pg=PA227|title=Polar lows: mesoscale weather systems in the polar regions|page=224|author1=Erik A.

They are part of the larger class of [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] weather systems. Polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high-latitude operations, such as shipping and gas and oil platforms. Polar lows have been referred to by many other terms, such as polar mesoscale vortex, Arctic hurricane, Arctic low, and cold air depression. Today the term is usually reserved for the more vigorous systems that have near-surface winds of at least 17&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=E. A. Rasmussen |author2=J.

A '''subtropical cyclone''' is a [[weather]] system that has some characteristics of a [[tropical cyclone]] and some characteristics of an [[extratropical cyclone]]. They can form between the equator and the 50th parallel.&lt;ref name = "A6"/&gt; As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should be characterized as tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones, and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David B.

Since they form from extratropical cyclones, which have colder temperatures aloft than normally found in the tropics, the sea surface temperatures required is around 23&amp;nbsp;degrees Celsius (73&amp;nbsp;°F) for their formation, which is  three degrees Celsius (5&amp;nbsp;°F) lower than for tropical cyclones.&lt;ref name="HistSubTropCyclones"&gt;{{cite web

====Tropical====
{{main|Tropical cyclone}}
[[File:2017 Atlantic hurricane season summary map.png|thumb|[[2017 Atlantic hurricane season]] summary map]]
A '''tropical cyclone''' is a [[storm|storm system]] characterized by a [[low-pressure system|low-pressure]] center and numerous [[thunderstorm]]s that produce strong winds and [[flood]]ing [[rain]]. A tropical cyclone feeds on heat released when moist [[air]] rises, resulting in [[condensation]] of [[water vapour]] contained in the moist air. They are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as [[nor'easter]]s, [[European windstorm]]s, and [[polar low]]s, leading to their classification as "warm core" storm systems.&lt;ref name = "AOML FAQ A7"/&gt;

[[File:Cyclone Catarina from the ISS on March 26 2004.JPG|thumb|275px|left|[[Hurricane Catarina]], a rare [[South Atlantic tropical cyclone]] viewed from the [[International Space Station]] on March 26, 2004]]

The term "tropical" refers to both the geographic origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively in [[tropics|tropical]] regions of the globe, and their dependence on [[Air mass#Classification and notation|Maritime Tropical air masses]] for their formation. The term "cyclone" refers to the storms' cyclonic nature, with [[Clockwise and counterclockwise|counterclockwise]] rotation in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and clockwise rotation in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Depending on their location and strength, tropical cyclones are referred to by other names, such as hurricane, [[typhoon]], tropical storm, cyclonic storm, tropical depression, or simply as a cyclone.

While tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential [[rain]], they are also able to produce high waves and a damaging [[storm surge]].&lt;ref name="oxfo"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/epirev/mxi011|pmid=15958424|author1=James M.

They develop over large bodies of warm water,&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ A15"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Chris Landsea]] |title=Frequently Asked Questions: How do tropical cyclones form? |date=2009-02-06 |publisher=[[NOAA]] |accessdate=2006-07-26 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827030639/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html |archivedate=2009-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence lose their strength if they move over land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sim Aberson|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/C2.html|title=Subject : C2) Doesn't the friction over land kill tropical cyclones?|accessdate=2008-02-25|date=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the reason coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone, while inland regions are relatively safe from strong winds. Heavy rains, however, can produce significant flooding inland. Storm surges are rises in sea level caused by the reduced pressure of the core that in effect "sucks" the water upward and from winds that in effect "pile" the water up. Storm surges can produce extensive coastal [[flood]]ing up to {{convert|40|km|mi}} from the coastline. Although their effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones can also relieve [[drought]] conditions.&lt;ref name="2005 EPac outlook"&gt;[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].

As a result, tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earth's [[troposphere]].

Many tropical cyclones [[tropical cyclogenesis|develop]] when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable. Others form when [[#Related cyclone types|other types of cyclones]] acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by [[#Steering winds|steering winds]] in the [[troposphere]]; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]]. On the other end of the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses.&lt;ref name = "AOML FAQ A7"/&gt; A tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.&lt;ref name=PadgetDecember2000&gt;{{cite web|author = Padgett, Gary|url = http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2001/summ0012.htm|title = Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary for December 2000|year = 2001|accessdate = 2006-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upper level types===

====Polar cyclone====
{{main|Polar cyclone}}
A '''polar''', '''sub-polar''', or '''Arctic cyclone''' (also known as a [[polar vortex]])&lt;ref name = "glossvortex"/&gt; is a vast area of low pressure that strengthens in the winter and weakens in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Halldór Björnsson |date=2005-01-19 |url=http://andvari.vedur.is/~halldor/HB/Met210old/GlobCirc.html |title=Global circulation |publisher=Veðurstofa Íslands |accessdate=2008-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807132251/http://andvari.vedur.is/~halldor/HB/Met210old/GlobCirc.html |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A polar cyclone is a low-pressure [[weather system]], usually spanning {{convert|1000|km|mi}} to {{convert|2000|km|mi}}, in which the air circulates in a counterclockwise direction in the northern hemisphere, and a clockwise direction in the southern hemisphere. The Coriolis acceleration acting on  the air masses moving poleward at high altitude, causes a counterclockwise circulation at high altitude. The poleward movement of air originates from the air circulation of the [[atmospheric circulation#Latitudinal circulation features|Polar cell]]. The polar low is not driven by convection as are tropical cyclones, nor the cold and warm air mass interactions as are extratropical cyclones, but is an artifact of the global air movement of the Polar cell. The base of the polar low is in the mid to upper troposphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, the polar cyclone has two centers on average. One center lies near Baffin Island and the other over northeast Siberia.&lt;ref name="glossvortex"&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Polar_vortex|title=Polar vortex|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern hemisphere, it tends to be located near the edge of the [[Ross ice shelf]] near 160 west longitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rui-Rong Chen |author2=Don L.

====TUTT cell====
{{Main|Upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex}}
Under specific circumstances, upper level cold lows can break off from the base of the Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT), which is located mid-ocean in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer months. These upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices, also known as TUTT cells or TUTT lows, usually move slowly from east-northeast to west-southwest, and their bases generally do not extend below {{convert|20,000|ft|m}} in altitude. A weak inverted surface trough within the [[trade wind]] is generally found underneath them, and they may also be associated with broad areas of high-level clouds. Downward development results in an increase of [[cumulus cloud]]s and the appearance of a surface vortex. In rare cases, they become warm-core [[tropical cyclone]]s. Upper cyclones and the upper troughs that trail tropical cyclones can cause additional outflow channels and aid in their intensification. Developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet emanating from the developing tropical disturbance/cyclone.&lt;ref name="CLARK"&gt;{{cite web|author = Clark Evans |url = http://flhurricane.com/cyclone/showflat.php?Cat=0&amp;Number=64429&amp;an=0&amp;page=0|title = Favorable trough interactions on tropical cyclones|publisher = Flhurricane.com|date = January 5, 2006|accessdate = 2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AMSPAPER"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Deborah Hanley |author2=John Molinari |author3=Daniel Keyser |title = A Composite Study of the Interactions between Tropical Cyclones and Upper-Tropospheric Troughs|date=October 2001|journal = [[Monthly Weather Review]]|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|volume = 129|issue = 10|pages = 2570–84|doi = 10.1175/1520-0493(2001)129&lt;2570:ACSOTI&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 2001MWRv..129.2570H   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mesoscale==
The following types of cyclones are not identifiable in synoptic charts.

===Mesocyclone===
{{Main|Mesocyclone}}
A '''mesocyclone''' is a [[vortex]] of air, {{convert|2.0|km|mi}} to {{convert|10|km|mi}} in diameter (the [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale of meteorology]]), within a [[convection|convective]] [[storm]].&lt;ref name="MesocyloneDef"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mesocyclone|author=Glossary of Meteorology|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|date=June 2000 |url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Mesocyclone|accessdate=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air rises and rotates around a vertical axis, usually in the same direction as low-pressure systems in both northern and southern hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, that is, associated with a localized low-pressure region within a [[supercell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office State College, Pennsylvania|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/ctp/features/2006/07_10/|title=Splitting Storm and Anti-cyclonic Rotating Mesocyclone in a Thunderstorm over Elk County July 10th, 2006|date=2006-07-16|accessdate=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe [[hail]]. Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in [[supercell]]s, where [[tornado]]es may form. About 1,700 mesocyclones form annually across the [[United States]], but only half produce tornadoes.&lt;ref name="FoN"&gt;Forces of Nature.

===Tornado===
{{main|Tornado}}

A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. Also referred to as twisters, a colloquial term in America, or cyclones, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology, in a wider sense, to name any closed low-pressure circulation.

===Dust devil===
{{main|Dust devil}}

A dust devil is a strong, well-formed, and relatively long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide and a few metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose a threat to both people and property.

===Waterspout===
{{main|Waterspout}}

A waterspout is a columnar vortex forming over water that is, in its most common form, a non-[[supercell]] [[tornado]] over water that is connected to a [[cumuliform cloud]]. While it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts, stronger versions spawned by [[mesocyclones]] do occur.

===Steam devil===
{{main|Steam devil}}

A gentle vortex over calm water or wet land made visible by rising water vapour.

===Fire whirl===
{{main|Fire whirl}}

A fire whirl – also colloquially known as a fire devil, fire tornado, firenado, or fire twister – is a whirlwind induced by a fire and often made up of flame or ash.

'''Don Stephens''' is a [[futurist]], eco-home [[sustainable design]]er and author. He has published books in the field of what he terms "optimized [[self-sufficiency]]" for a range of uncertain-future scenarios, that is also labeled [[survivalism]] by others.

In the 1960s, Stephens popularized the term "retreater" to describe those in the survivalist movement who were making preparations to avoid conflict by leaving populated areas for a pre-established remote [[Retreat (survivalism)|survival retreat]] when or if society broke down. (At that time, this trend was primarily motivated by concerns about monetary collapse arising out of anticipated accelerating [[monetary inflation]].) He also wrote on this topic for ''Innovator'' magazine, ''Inflation Survival Letter'', ''Atlantis Quarterly'' and ''[[Harry Browne]]'s Newsletter'', among others.  Stephens also contributed the "Safe Shelter &amp; Independent Energy" chapter for ''The Complete Survival Guide'' (1983), which was edited by ark Thiffault. In public speaking venues, newsletters, and magazines, Stephens has been associated with [[Harry Browne]], Robert D. Kephart, James McKeever, and [[Mel Tappan]].

Stephens studied architecture at the University of Idaho, and worked in a range of architectural and engineering firms in Idaho, Washington and southern California, before establishing his own eco-home design and consulting practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenershelter.org Greener Shelter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  From his university days onward, he has explored and evolved techniques of [[active solar]] and [[passive solar]] heating, [[solar power]], earth-integrated design ([[earth sheltering]]), and pioneered uses of a range of "alternative", "natural", and salvaged materials and building techniques in home and retreat construction.  These include [[straw bale]], high-density recompressed [[strawblocks]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenershelter.org/index.php?pg=4 Greener Shelter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; earth-rammed tires, tire bales, urbanite, rammed earth, [[rice hulls]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenershelter.org/index.php?pg=6 Greener Shelter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; salvaged/used carpeting, and the pre-stressed "self-filling" of cement-bonded polystyrene bead [[insulating concrete form]]s (ICFs).

Stephens developed (and originated the name for) the [[Annualized geo solar|Annualized Geo-Solar]] (AGS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenershelter.org/index.php?pg=2 Greener Shelter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; technique for simply and inexpensively capturing/storing the summer sun's heat, for predictable, delayed return six months later, to maintain up to 100% of needed winter warmth, which has drawn particular interest.  This grew out of his pioneering work with solar and earth-sheltering, beginning in 1960. On these topics, he has written for ''Earth-Shelter Digest'', ''Earthtone'' magazine and ''The Last Straw''. He also prepared a requested paper on AGS for The Global Sustainable Building Conference 2005, in Tokyo, Japan.  Stephens also presented this material at a number of conferences and workshops over the years for The American Underground-Space Association, Sol-West, the Northwest Renewable Energy Festival, the International Strawbale Association and the Northwest EcoBuilding Guild, and others.

In keeping with his professional advocacies, he lives in a retrofitted century-old home heated by solar and biomass, utilizes photovoltaics for power generation, drives an electric vehicle, and practices organic gardening, composting and rainwater catchment.

Don Stephens passed away in February 2018.

In [[Sociology|social]], [[Cultural studies|cultural]] and [[religious studies]], the "'''epic of evolution'''" is a [[narrative]] that blends religious and scientific views of [[Cosmology|cosmic]], [[Biological evolution|biological]] and [[sociocultural evolution]] in a [[Mythology|mythological]] manner. According to ''Taylor's Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'', an "epic of evolution" encompasses
{{quote|the 14 billion year narrative of cosmic, planetary, life, and cultural evolution—told in sacred ways. Not only does it bridge mainstream science and a diversity of religious traditions; if skillfully told, it makes the science story memorable and deeply meaningful, while enriching one's religious faith or secular outlook.&lt;ref&gt;''The Epic of Evolution'', 2004 [http://www.religionandnature.com/ern/ ''Taylor's Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
[[File:Plos wilson.jpg|thumb|upright|[[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]] coined the phrase "evolutionary epic" in 1978.]]

"Epic of evolution" seems to have originated from the [[Sociobiology|sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]]'s use of the phrase "evolutionary epic" in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;E. O. Wilson coined the term "evolutionary epic"– Teilhard Perspective, Volume 30 #2 Fall 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The evolutionary epic is probably the best myth we will ever have." ''On Human Nature'', [[E. O. Wilson]], 1978, p 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was not the first to use the term but his prominence prompted its usage as the morphed phrase 'epic of evolution'. In later years, he also used the latter term.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|last=Novacek |first=Michael J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/americasbest/science.medicine/pro.eowilson.html |title=Lifetime achievement: E.O. Wilson |work= |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=2006-11-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014091550/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/americasbest/science.medicine/pro.eowilson.html |archivedate=2006-10-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalistic and liberal religious writers have picked up on Wilson's term and have used it in a number of texts. These authors however have at times used other terms to refer to the idea: ''Universe Story'' ([[Brian Swimme]], [[John F. Haught]]), ''Great Story'' (Connie Barlow, [[Michael Dowd]]), ''Everybody's Story'' ([[Loyal Rue]]&lt;ref&gt;Rue, Loyal.  ''Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution'', SUNY Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-7914-4392-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;), ''New Story'' ([[Thomas Berry]], [[Al Gore]], Brian Swimme) and ''Cosmic Evolution'' ([[Eric Chaisson]]&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, Eric. ''Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos'', Columbia University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-231-13560-2}}, paper978-0-231-13561-0&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Alfred K.  ''The Epic of Evolution, Its Etiology and Art: A Study of Vardis Fisher's Testament of Man'', University Microfilms International, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, James B. ''The Epic of Evolution: Science and Religion in Dialogue'', Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2003, {{ISBN|0-13-093318-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Gordon. ''The ''Epic of Evolution'' as a Framework for Human Orientation'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hefner. ''The Evolutionary Epic''. Zygon, vol.44 #1, March 2009, page 3. "An enormous amount of attention has been given to constructing this myth. Such efforts commonly go under the names 'evolutionary epic,' 'epic of evolution,' or 'epic of creation'."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==
Evolution generally refers to biological [[evolution]], but here it means a [[process(science)|process]] in which the whole universe is a progression of interrelated phenomena, a gradual process&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Polkinghorne, ''The Work of Love: Creation as Kenosis'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2001, (Peacocke chapter) page 21, {{ISBN|0-8028-4885-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=fy1-hnYDHGIC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;vq=One+can+only+speak+of+creation+as+a+process&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1]&lt;/ref&gt; in which something changes into a different and usually more complex form ([[emergence]]). It should not be 'biologized' as it includes many areas of science.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley – [https://books.google.com/books?id=yaecVMhMWaEC&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Christianity:,epic+of+evolution&amp;ei=TDbOSaGeLJ2EyATUoOmLCg ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''], Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2001, page 229, {{ISBN|90-04-11695-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, outside of the scientific community, the term evolution is frequently used differently from scientists' usage. Even respected dictionaries may present questionable definitions that are not scientific or only address genetic changes. Unfortunately it is common for the general public to enter into a discussion about evolution with a wrong definition in mind. This often leads to misunderstanding since scientists are viewing evolution from a different perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Moran – What is Evolution, 1993 [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html] retrieved 4-07-09&lt;/ref&gt; The same applies to the use of the term theory as used in the theory of evolution (see references for [[Evolution as theory and fact]]).

This epic is not a long narrative poem but a series of events that form the proper subject for a laudable kind of tale. It is mythic in that it is a story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the worldview of a people and explains a natural phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of myth that has an approach to investigation that is empirical or scientific.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthlight.org/interview26.html Epic of Evolution is definitely mythic – Brian Swimme interview]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joseph Campbell myths serve two purposes—provide meaning for a maturing individual (an individuate) and how to be part of a community. This Epic does both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://personallifemedia.com/podcasts/212-living-dialogues/episodes/2712-michael-dowd-great-story-epic Duncan Campbell in one of his interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The epic as myth==
Dr. [[William Grassie]] of Temple University writes that the word "[[myth]]" in common usage is usually misunderstood. In academia it defines "a story that serves to define the fundamental world view of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society". He suggests that the Greek term ''mythos'' would be a better term to apply to the Epic as it is more all-encompassing. He concluded that there is not yet an interpretive tradition within science and society about this epic of evolution. If anything, there is an anti-interpretation tradition. Consequently, this is dangerous as it is a powerful revelation at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Can the modern evolutionary cosmology be a mythic story for our time?[http://www.science-spirit.org/printerfriendly.php?article_id=29]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}- retrieved 3-22-09&lt;/ref&gt; Grassie says the Epic is complex and multifaceted, not simple or easy to understand. It takes a romantic vision, philosophical rigor, and artistic interpretations. It requires a consilience of modern disciplines and acceptance of social diversity. The ancient wisdoms of the world's spiritual traditions must be adapted to make the framework to weave the Epic.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Grassie]], Science and Spirit 1998, 9(1) – page 6 of this ref- [http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf Science and Spirit] retrieved 3-16-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations of the epic==
&lt;!-- Please attempt to keep this to a paragraph per 'interpretation' --&gt;
[[E. O. Wilson]] explained that humans had a need for the epic of evolution because they must have a mythical story or a sublime account of how the world was created and how humanity became part of it. Religious epics fulfill a primal need in this respect as they verify that humans are part of something greater than themselves. The best empirical knowledge that science and history can provide is necessary in order to provide a comparable epic tale that will reliably unite a separated human spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Edward O. Wilson, Foreword of ''Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution'' By Loyal D. Rue, SUNY Press, 1999, page ix and x,{{ISBN|0-7914-4392-2}},&lt;/ref&gt; He believes the evolutionary epic can be as inherently noble as any religious epic when it is expressed in a poetic way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf  Edward O. Wilson, Consilience 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, biologist Ursula Goodenough sees the tale of natural emergence as far more magical than traditional religious miracles. It is a story that people can work with in a  religious way if they elect to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Goodenough – Sacred Depths of Nature, Oxford University Press, USA; 1 edition (June 15, 2000), {{ISBN|0-19-513629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Hefner]] uses the analogy of weaving to describe the Epic. The warp anchors the story and the weft creates the pattern and the tapestry. The Epic, as scientists see it, is the warp and the weft forms the pattern as each of us views it (we are all weavers) but the patterns all have the warp in common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf Classic Quotations – Philip Hefner, 1997 AAAS Epic of Evolution Conference ]&lt;/ref&gt; Hefner writes that stories about the evolutionary epic are redolent with ultimacy.{{Clarify|date=September 2009}}  It is not science; it is scientifically informed myth, a myth driven by the refusal to give up on the insistence that the natural world and our lives in the world have meaning and purpose. It is a mythical tale of irony and hope that fills a large space in the domain of religion-and-science.&lt;ref&gt;Hefner – The Evolutionary Epic – Zygon, vol.44 #1, March 2009, page 5,6&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Ursula Goodenough]] also makes use of Hefner's weaving metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Goodenough – ''The Sacred Depths of Nature'', Oxford University Press US, 1998, page 272, {{ISBN|0-19-512613-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connie Barlow and [[Michael Dowd]]'s Great Story divides the epic into 8 phases eons or eras: the [[Big bang|Great Radiance]], the Galactic, [[Hadean]], [[Archean]], [[Proterozoic]], [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]], and [[Cenozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatstory.org/timeline.html  Great Story Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; Dowd uses the term 'epic of evolution' to help construct his viewpoint of evolution theology (a form of [[theistic evolution]]). His position is that science and religious faith are not mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/node/1128 Evolution Theology: Religion 2.0]&lt;/ref&gt; He preaches that the epic of cosmic, biological, and human evolution, revealed by science, is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe. Evolution is viewed as a spiritual process that it is not meaningless blind chance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/book Thank God for Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Loyal Rue]] states that there is nothing in the core of everybody's story to rule out belief in a personal deity. However belief in God is not an indispensable part of this narrative and here will be both theistic and non-theistic versions of it.&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue – Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution, SUNY Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-7914-4392-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says it is the fundamental story of matter, created from energy, the organization of that matter into complex conditions, and then via self-organization into diverse life forms. Humans are as other living things—we are by nature star-born, earth-formed, fitness-maximized, biochemical systems. An aspect of the Epic is the evolution of behavior by that biochemical system.&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue – ''Religion is not About God'', Rutgers University Press, 2006, Part 1.1, {{ISBN|0-8135-3955-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Swimme]] sees the Epic as a way to gently maneuver a person into the magnificence of the Universe and as an antidote to the unhealthy consciousness of consumerism. It is the way into the future and enabled him to comprehend the cultural significance of this new story of science moving away from a materialistic worldview. It may move science away from its traditional abstractness to the uniqueness found in natural history. To him evolution and creativity are equivalent so it could be the Epic of Creativity (similar to Gordon Kaufman's thinking). Although the Epic is scientific, it is 'definitely mythic'—it has the fundamental nature of being mythic. "You take hydrogen gas, and you leave it alone, and it turns into rosebuds, giraffes and humans."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brianswimme.org/media/excerpts.asp  Center for the Story of the Universe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801065326/http://www.brianswimme.org/media/excerpts.asp |date=2009-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon D. Kaufman]] sees the Epic as a serendipitous creative process. He states that it is a notion that can interpret the enormous expansion and complexification of the physical universe (from the Big Bang outward), as well as the evolution of life here on earth and the gradual emergence of human historical existence. The whole vast process manifests (in varying degrees) serendipitous creativity, an everflowing coming into being of new modes of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Kaufman  –  ''God, mystery, diversity: Christian theology in a pluralistic world'', Fortress Press, 1996, page 101–102, {{ISBN|0-8006-2959-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=uYKDqTUfshQC] retrieved 3-17-09&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''In the beginning—creativity'', he says this creative process is God. Creativity, as metaphor, and as defined in the concept of evolution, has possibilities for constructing a new concept of God. The most foundational kind of creativity is found in that of cosmos/biological evolution—a paradigm that is now the organizing principle of all the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Kaufman – ''In the beginning—creativity'', Fortress Press, 2004, page x,33,57,137, {{ISBN|0-8006-6093-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wMcBvErCX0C] retrieved 3-17-09]&lt;/ref&gt; It would seem as though he was equating God to the evolutionary story. This is similar to Dowd who sees the facts of Nature as God's native tongue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/node/1634 evolutionary evangelist] retrieved 2009-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Chaisson]] orients his view of the epic around an "arrow of time",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html Two movies: Arrow of Time and Cosmic Origins]&lt;/ref&gt; which he divides into 'Seven Ages of the Cosmos': particulate, galactic, stellar, planetary, chemical, biological, and cultural.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson – Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/splash.html Cosmic Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt; However, such a thermodynamic arrow is not intended to be directional, a common misunderstanding; he sees no purpose, plan, or design in evolution, which he regards as unceasing, uncaring, and unpredictable. Chaisson’s strictly scientific analysis of evolution in its broadest sense—[[Cosmic Evolution (book)|cosmic evolution)]]—implies an unidirectional, meandering process extending from the big bang to humankind on Earth, and continuing while likely producing increasing complexity, perhaps forever, to ends unknown. As a physicist, he is perhaps best known for attempting to quantify the epic of evolution, using the currently known laws of science and the scientific method (with its insistence on experimental tests of all ideas, principally those of [[energy rate density]]) in order to empirically discriminate between objective sense and subjective nonsense. What emerges is a grand and inspiring ''scientific'' narrative of who we are and whence we came—the most recent and up-to-date version of this work having been summarized in a long peer-review article.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/big_history_review_Chaisson_TSWJ2014.pdf "The Natural Science Underlying Big History,"] ''The Scientific World Journal'', v 2014, 41 pgs, 2014; DOI:10.1155/2014/384912.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation-evolution controversy goes beyond the field of [[evolutionary biology]] and  includes many fields of science (cosmology, geology, paleontology, thermodynamics, physics and sociobiology).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/index.html ''An Index to Creationist Claims''] , Mark Isaak, [[Talkorigins Archive]],Copyright © 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate is sometimes portrayed as being between science and religion. However, as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] states:
{{quote|Today, many religious denominations accept that biological evolution has produced the diversity of living things over billions of years of Earth’s history. Many have issued statements observing that evolution and the tenets of their faiths are compatible. Scientists and theologians have written eloquently about their awe and wonder at the history of the universe and of life on this planet, explaining that they see no conflict between their faith in God and the evidence for evolution. Religious denominations that do not accept the occurrence of evolution tend to be those that believe in strictly literal interpretations of religious texts.|''Science, Evolution, and Creationism'', National Academy of Sciences&lt;ref&gt;

Dr.[[John Haught]],  Roman Catholic theologian, in his ''Science and Religion: from Conflict to Conversation'' suggests a theistic acceptance of the Epic. He says contemporary theology is being changed by evolutionary science. There are many versions undergoing constant revision. He considers evolution to be, at least provisionally, a most appropriate and fruitful scientific framework within which to think about God today and deplores that contemporary theology gets hung up in the creationism controversy.&lt;ref&gt;John F.

Not all of the Epic's advocates are distinguished scientists. Some are Christians who consider it a 'narrative of mythic proportions' that contain religious aspects. They see it as a multifaceted concept that has been in Christian theology implicitly for hundreds of years and is congenial to perspectives that include ultimacy, transcendence, purpose and morality. However, there are both humanists and creationists who dispute this stance, making unclear the many varied theological stories of our world.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley – [https://books.google.com/books?id=yaecVMhMWaEC&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Christianity:,epic+of+evolution&amp;ei=TDbOSaGeLJ2EyATUoOmLCg ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''], Wm.

An '''eruption column''' is a cloud of super-heated [[Volcanic ash|ash]] and [[tephra]] suspended in [[volcanic gas|gases]] emitted during an explosive [[volcanic eruption]]. The volcanic materials form a column that may rise many kilometers into the air above the vent of the volcano. In the most explosive eruptions, the eruption column may rise over {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}}, penetrating the [[stratosphere]]. Stratospheric injection of [[Particulate|aerosols]] by volcanoes is a major cause of short-term [[climate change]].

A common occurrence in explosive eruptions is ''column collapse'' when the eruption column is or becomes too dense to be lifted high into the sky by air convection, and instead falls down the slopes of the volcano to form [[pyroclastic flow]]s or [[pyroclastic surge|surge]]s (although the latter is less dense). On some occasions, if the material isn't dense enough to fall, it may create [[pyrocumulonimbus]] clouds.

==Formation==

Eruption columns form in explosive volcanic activity, when the high concentration of [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatile materials]] in the rising [[magma]] causes it to be disrupted into fine [[volcanic ash]] and coarser [[tephra]]. The ash and tephra are ejected at speeds of several hundred metres per second, and can rise rapidly to heights of several kilometres, lifted by enormous [[convection]] currents.

Eruption columns may be transient, if formed by a discrete explosion, or sustained, if produced by a continuous eruption or closely spaced discrete explosions.

==Structure==

The solid and/or liquid materials in an eruption column are lifted by processes which vary as the material ascends:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/volcano/ | title = How volcanoes work - The eruption model (QuickTime movie) | work = San Diego State University | accessdate = 2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* At the base of the column, material is violently forced upwards out of the crater by the pressure of rapidly expanding gases, mainly steam. The gases expand because the pressure of rock above it rapidly reduces as it approaches the surface. This region is called the ''gas thrust region'' and typically reaches to only one or two kilometers above the vent.
* The ''convective thrust region'' covers most of the height of the column. The gas thrust region is very turbulent and surrounding air becomes mixed into it and heated. The air expands, reducing its density and rising. The rising air carries all the solid and liquid material from the eruption entrained in it upwards.
* As the column rises into less dense surrounding air, it will eventually reach an altitude where the hot, rising air is of the same density as the surrounding cold air. In this neutral buoyancy region, the erupted material will then no longer rise through convection, but solely through any upward momentum which it has. This is called the ''umbrella region'', and is usually marked by the column spreading out sideways. The eruptive material and the surrounding cold air has the same density at the base of the umbrella region, and the top is marked by the maximum height which momentum carries the material upward. Because the speeds are very low or negligible in this region it is often distorted by stratospheric winds.

==Column heights==

[[Image:MtRedoubtedit1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Eruption column rising over [[Redoubt Volcano]], Alaska]]

The column will stop rising once it attains an altitude where it is more dense than the surrounding air. Several factors control the height that an eruption column can reach.

Intrinsic factors include the diameter of the erupting vent, the [[gas]] content of the magma, and the [[velocity]] at which it is ejected. Extrinsic factors can be important, with winds sometimes limiting the height of the column, and the local thermal temperature gradient also playing a role. The atmospheric temperature in the [[troposphere]] normally decreases by about 6-7 [[Kelvin|K]]/km, but small changes in this gradient can have a large effect on the final column height. Theoretically, the maximum achievable column height is thought to be about {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr= on}}. In practice, column heights ranging from about {{convert|2-45|km|mi|abbr=on}} are seen.

Eruption columns with heights of over {{convert|20-40|km|mi|abbr=on}} break through the [[tropopause]] and inject [[particulate]]s into the [[stratosphere]]. Ashes and aerosols in the troposphere are quickly removed by [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], but material injected into the stratosphere is much more slowly dispersed, in the absence of [[weather]] systems. Substantial amounts of stratospheric injection can have global effects: after [[Mount Pinatubo]] erupted in 1991, global temperatures dropped by about {{convert|0.5|C-change|F-change|abbr=on}}. The largest eruptions are thought to cause temperature drops down to several degrees, and are potentially the cause of some of the known [[mass extinction]]s.

Eruption column heights are a useful way of measuring eruption intensity since for a given atmospheric temperature, the column height is proportional to the fourth root of the mass eruption rate. Consequently, given similar conditions, to double the column height requires an eruption ejecting 16 times as much material per second. The column height of eruptions which have not been observed can be estimated by mapping the ''maximum'' distance that pyroclasts of different sizes are carried from the vent—the higher the column the further ejected material of a particular mass (and therefore size) can be carried.

The approximate maximum height of an eruption column is given by the equation.
:H = k(MΔT)&lt;sup&gt;1/4&lt;/sup&gt;
Where:
:k is a constant that depends on various properties, such as atmospheric conditions.
:M is the mass eruption rate.
:ΔT is the difference in temperature between the erupting magma and the surrounding atmosphere.

==Hazards==

===Column collapse===

Eruption columns may become so laden with dense material that they are too heavy to be supported by convection currents. This can suddenly happen if, for example, the rate at which magma is erupted increases to a point where insufficient air is entrained to support it, or if the magma density suddenly increases as denser magma from lower regions in a [[Igneous differentiation|stratified]] [[magma chamber]] is tapped.

If it does happen, then material reaching the bottom of the convective thrust region can no longer be adequately supported by convection and will fall under [[gravity]], forming a [[pyroclastic flow]] or [[pyroclastic surge|surge]] which can travel down the slopes of a [[volcano]] at speeds of over {{convert|100-200|kph|mph|abbr=on}}. Column collapse is one of the most common and dangerous volcanic hazards in column-creating eruptions.

===Aircraft===

Several eruptions have seriously endangered aircraft which have encountered or passed by the eruption column. In two separate incidents in 1982, airliners flew into the upper reaches of an eruption column blasted off by [[Galunggung|Mount Galunggung]], and the ash severely damaged both aircraft. Particular hazards were the ingestion of ash stopping the engines, the sandblasting of the cockpit windows rendering them largely opaque and the contamination of fuel through the ingestion of ash through pressurisation ducts. The damage to engines is a particular problem since temperatures inside a [[gas turbine]] are sufficiently high that volcanic ash is melted in the [[combustion chamber]], and forms a glass coating on components further downstream of it, for example on turbine blades.

In the case of [[British Airways Flight 9]], the aircraft lost power on all four engines, and in the other, nineteen days later, three of the four engines failed on a Singapore Airlines 747. In both cases, engines were successfully restarted but the aircraft were forced to make emergency landings in [[Jakarta]].

Similar damage to aircraft occurred due to an eruption column over [[Mount Redoubt (Alaska)|Redoubt]] volcano in [[Alaska]] in 1989. Following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, aircraft were diverted to avoid the eruption column, but nonetheless, fine ash dispersing over a wide area in Southeast Asia caused damage to 16 aircraft, some as far as {{convert|1,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the volcano.

Eruption columns are not usually visible on weather radar and may be obscured by ordinary clouds or night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/mags/cg/&amp;toc=comp/mags/cg/1995/04/g4toc.xml&amp;DOI=10.1109/38.391488 | title = Visualization of Volcanic ash clouds | journal = IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications | date = July 1995 | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages =34–39 |author1=Mitchell Roth |author2=Rick Guritz |accessdate= 2007-06-30 | doi = 10.1109/38.391488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the risks posed to aviation by eruption columns, there is a network of nine [[Volcanic Ash Advisory Center]]s around the world which continuously monitor for eruption columns using data from satellites, ground reports, pilot reports and meteorological models.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.bom.gov.au/info/vaac/index.shtml | title = Keeping aircraft clear of volcanic ash - Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Center | work = Australian Government - Bureau of Meteorology | accessdate = 2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extra-low voltage''' ('''ELV''') is an [[electricity supply]] [[voltage]] in a range which carries a low risk of dangerous [[electrical shock]].&lt;ref&gt;[[BS 7671]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[DIN]]/[[Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik|VDE]] 0100-410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60364-4-41: Low-voltage electrical installations – Part 4-41: Protection for safety – Protection against electric shock.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 61140: Protection against electric shock – Common aspects for installation and equipment.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various standards that define extra-low voltage. The [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] member organizations and the UK IET (BS 7671:2008) define an ELV device or circuit as one in which the [[electrical potential]] between [[electrical conductor|conductor]] or electrical conductor and [[ground (electrical)|earth]] (ground) '''does not exceed''' 50&amp;nbsp;V a.c. or 120&amp;nbsp;V d.c. (ripple free). EU's [[Low Voltage Directive]] applies from 50&amp;nbsp;V a.c. or 75&amp;nbsp;V d.c.

The IEC and IET go on to define actual types of extra-low voltage systems, for example SELV, PELV, FELV. These can be supplied using sources including motor / fossil fuel generator sets, transformers, switched PSU's or rechargeable battery. SELV, PELV, FELV, are distinguished by various [[safety]] properties, supply characteristics and design voltages.

Some types of [[landscape lighting]] use SELV / PELV (extra-low voltage) systems. Modern battery operated hand tools fall in the SELV category. In more arduous conditions 25 [[volt]]s [[root mean square|RMS]] [[alternating current]] / 60 volts (ripple-free) [[direct current]] can be specified to further reduce hazard. Lower voltage can apply in wet or conductive conditions where there is even greater potential for electric shock. These systems should still fall under the SELV / PELV (ELV) safety specifications.

==Types==

===Separated or safety extra-low voltage (SELV)===
IEC defines a SELV system as "an electrical system in which the voltage cannot exceed ELV under normal conditions, and under single-fault conditions, ''including'' [[Ground (electricity)|earth fault]]s in other circuits". It is generally accepted that the acronym: '''SELV''' stands for '''separated extra-low voltage''' (separated from earth) as defined in installation standards (e.g. [[BS 7671]]), though BS EN 60335 refers to it as '''safety extra-low voltage'''.

A SELV circuit must have:
* Electrical protective-separation (i.e. [[double insulation]], reinforced insulation or protective screening) from all circuits other than SELV and PELV (i.e. all circuits that might carry higher voltages)
* Simple separation from other SELV systems, from PELV systems and from earth (ground)

The safety of a SELV circuit is provided by
* The extra-low voltage
* The low risk of accidental contact with a higher voltage
* The lack of a return path through earth (ground) that [[electric current]] could take in case of contact with a human body

The design of a SELV circuit typically involves an isolating [[transformer]], guaranteed minimum distances between conductors and [[electrical insulation]] barriers.  The [[electrical connector]]s of SELV circuits should be designed such that they do not mate with connectors commonly used for non-SELV circuits.

Typical examples for a SELV circuit: decorative out-door lighting, [[Appliance classes|Class III]] [[battery charger]], fed from a Class II [[power supply]]. Modern cordless hand tools are considered SELV equipment.

===Protected extra-low voltage (PELV)===
IEC 61140 defines a PELV system as "an electrical system in which the voltage cannot exceed ELV under normal conditions, and under single-fault conditions, ''except'' earth faults in other circuits".

A PELV circuit only requires protective-separation from all circuits other than SELV and PELV (i.e., all circuits that might carry higher voltages), but it may have connections to other PELV systems and earth (ground).

In contrast to a SELV circuit, a PELV circuit can have a [[protective earth]] (ground) connection. A PELV circuit, just as with SELV, requires a design that guarantees a low risk of accidental contact with a higher voltage. For a transformer, this can mean that the primary and secondary windings must be separated by an extra insulation barrier, or by a conductive shield with a protective earth connection.

A typical example for a PELV circuit is a [[computer]] with a [[Appliance classes|Class I]] [[power supply]].

===Functional extra-low voltage (FELV)===
The term functional extra-low voltage (FELV) describes any other extra-low-voltage circuit that does not fulfill the requirements for an SELV or PELV circuit. Although the FELV part of a circuit uses an extra-low voltage, it is not adequately protected from accidental contact with higher voltages in other parts of the circuit. Therefore the protection requirements for the higher voltage have to be applied to the entire circuit.

Examples for FELV circuits include those that generate an extra low voltage through a [[semiconductor]] device or a [[potentiometer]] or a transformer. A typical example is an electronically controlled toaster where the timer circuit runs off extra low voltage derived from a tap on the heating element. Another is the old door-bell circuit fed from a transformer.

===UK Reduced low voltage (RLV)===
The IET / BSI (BS 7671) also define Reduced low voltage (RLV) which can be either single phase or three phase A.C. This system has been used for many years on construction sites. Both single and three phase. The single phase voltage is 110&amp;nbsp;V a.c. though having a "centre tapped Earth" reducing the voltage to Earth to 55&amp;nbsp;V a.c. The three phase is 110&amp;nbsp;V phase to phase, 63&amp;nbsp;V to Neutral / Earth. This system is slightly outside ELV but still very commonly used for cord powered hand tools and temporary lighting in hazardous areas.

==Stand-alone power systems==
Cabling for extra-low voltage systems, such as in [[remote-area power system]]s (RAPS), is designed to minimise energy losses while maximising safety. Lower voltages require a higher current for the same power. The higher current results in greater resistive losses in the cabling. Cable sizing must therefore consider maximum demand, voltage drop over the cable, and [[current-carrying capacity]]. Voltage drop is usually the main factor considered, but [[current-carrying capacity]] is as important when considering short, high-current runs such as between a battery bank and inverter.

[[Electric arc|Arcing]] is a risk in DC ELV systems, and some fuse types which can cause undesired arcing include semi-enclosed, rewireable and [[fuse (automotive)|automotive fuse]] types. Instead [[Fuse (electrical)#Characteristic parameters|high rupturing capacity]] fuses and appropriately rated [[circuit breaker]]s are the recommended type for RAPS. Cable termination and connections must be done properly to avoid arcing also, and [[soldering]] is not recommended.

==Regulations==
Precise definitions of "extra low voltage" are given in applicable wiring regulations in a region.

===EU===
In the European Union, the ''[[Low Voltage Directive]]'' defines low voltage starting from 50&amp;nbsp;V AC, and 75&amp;nbsp;V DC. The directive only covers electrical equipment and not voltages appearing inside equipment or voltages in electrical components. [[IEC 60364]] defines it as 50 V AC and 120 V DC.

===Australia and New Zealand===
AS/NZS 3000 ''Wiring Rules'' define "extra low voltage" as "Not exceeding 50&amp;nbsp;V a.c or 120&amp;nbsp;V ripple-free d.c." However, AS/ACIF S009 Clause 3.1.78.1 Extra-Low Voltage (ELV)states: "a voltage not exceeding 42.4&amp;nbsp;V peak or 60&amp;nbsp;V d.c.[AS/NZS 60950.1:2003]" and adds a note: "This definition differs from the ELV definition contained in AS/NZS 3000:2000" which is more closely aligned to the Telecommunications Network Voltage (TNV) limits&amp;nbsp;... i.e. 120&amp;nbsp;V d.c. or 70.7&amp;nbsp;V a.c. peak (50&amp;nbsp;V a.c. r.m.s.)" which accommodates telephone ringing voltage on the nominally &amp;minus;48&amp;nbsp;Vdc battery supply which could be encountered on a telephone line and was not considered hazardous, whereas 120&amp;nbsp;Vac without current limiting at its source can inject 115mA into individuals leading to fibrillation of the heart.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, ELV (''Extra-baixa tensão'' or ''EBT'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is officially defined in Regulatory Standard no. 10 from the [[Brazilian Ministry of Labor and Employment]] as any voltage "not exceeding 50 volts a.c. or 120 volts d.c.".&lt;ref name="NR10"&gt;{{cite web | website = Brazilian Ministry of Labor and Employment Website | url = http://portal.mte.gov.br/data/files/8A7C816A38CF493C013906EC437E23BF/NR-10%20%28atualizada%29.pdf | language = portuguese | date = December 7, 2004 | accessdate = September 9, 2015 | title = NR-10 atualizada - Glossário |trans-title=updated NR-10 - Glossary }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that standard defines safety rules for electricity, the Regulatory Standard no. 12 requires an even lower voltage for start and stop devices on machines and equipment made from March 2012 and on, stating it shall not exceed 25 volts a.c. or 60 volts d.c.&lt;ref name="NR12"&gt;{{cite web | website = Brazilian Ministry of Labor and Employment Website | url = http://portal.mte.gov.br/data/files/8A7C816A4DA189CA014E505FF4496DF0/NR-12%20%28atualizada%202015%29.pdf | language = portuguese | date = June 25, 2015 | accessdate = September 9, 2015 | title = NR-12 atualizada - item 12.36 |trans-title=updated NR-12 - Item 12.36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''freshet''''' is most commonly used to describe a spring thaw resulting from snow and ice melt in rivers located in the northern latitudes of [[North America]].  A spring freshet can sometimes last several weeks on large river systems, resulting in significant inundation of [[flood plain]]s as the [[snowpack]] melts in the river's [[drainage basin|catchment area]]. Freshets occur with generally diminishing strength and duration depending upon the snowpacks having large accumulations and then the local average rates of warming temperatures; late spring melts allowing faster flooding from the relatively longer days and higher solar angle against more southerly latitudes and elevations reaching average melting temperatures sooner where earlier and generally lesser seasonal [[snow]] piles melt more gradually spread over a longer melt period. Serious flooding from southern freshets are more often related to rain storms of large [[tropical storm|tropical]] [[weather system]]s rolling in from the [[South Atlantic]] or [[Gulf of Mexico]], to add their powerful [[specific heat|heating capacity]] to lesser snow packs. Tropically induced rainfall influenced quick melts can also affect [[snow cover]] to latitudes as far north as southern Canada, so long as the generally colder [[air mass]] is not [[blocking high|blocking]] northward movement of low pressure systems.
 
In the eastern part of the [[continent]], annual freshets occur from the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Taiga]] ranging along both sides of the [[Great Lakes]] then down through the heavily [[forest]]ed [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] [[mountain chain]] and [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] [[valley]] from Northern [[Maine]] into [[barrier range]]s in [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]].

In the western part of the continent, freshets occur throughout the generally much higher elevations of the various west coast mountain ranges that extend southward down from [[Alaska]] even into the northern parts of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]].

'''George Musalas "Colvos" Colvocoresses''' (October 22, 1816 – June 3, 1872) was an American Navy officer who commanded the {{USS|Saratoga|1842|2}} during the [[American Civil War]]. From 1838 up until 1842, he took part in the [[United States Exploring Expedition]], which explored large regions of the Pacific Ocean.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
He was born on the island of [[Chios]] in the [[Greek Archipelago]] on October 22, 1816. As a member of a prominent Greek family, he was kidnapped along with his mother and two sisters and ransomed from the Turks after [[Chios Massacre|the massacre]] of the Greek population of the island in 1822, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. His family's fortunes were devastated by the massacre. Most close relatives, including six brothers, were killed. He was enslaved at 6 years of age, but his father managed to buy back his freedom.

By 1824, Colvocoresses was sent to [[Baltimore]] in the United States by his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chianfed.org/mos/content/view/33/43/ |title=The Chian Federation - Children of the Chios Massacre |first=Miljan Peter |last=Ilich |work=chianfed.org |year=2012 |accessdate=March 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611235120/http://www.chianfed.org/mos/content/view/33/43 |archivedate=June 11, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the adopted son of Captain [[Alden Partridge]], the founder of the American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy (later [[Norwich University]]) in [[Norwich, Vermont]]. Colvocoresses entered the Navy after graduating from the Academy in 1831. Several generations of his family have also graduated from Norwich and followed military careers.

=== Naval career ===
In 1832, he was appointed a midshipman, and in 1836-1837 attached to the frigate {{USS|United States|1797|2}} on the [[Mediterranean Squadron (United States)|Mediterranean Squadron]]. From 1838 up until 1842, he served in the United States Exploring Expedition, better known as the [[Wilkes Expedition]] of the Pacific Ocean. Colvocoresses authored a work on the Wilkes Expedition in 1852, entitled ''Four Years in a Government Exploring Expedition''. He was promoted to lieutenant on December 7, 1843 and to commander on July 2, 1861. 

On January 29, 1862, the vessel {{USS|Supply|1846|2}}, under his command, captured the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] schooner ''Stephen Hart'' off the south coast of Florida, carrying assorted cargo. In early August 1864 with 115 men in 7 boats from his sloop {{USS|Saratoga|1842|2}}, he conducted an expedition to gather intelligence and capture enemy prisoners. Two week later, at South Newport, Georgia, Colvocoresses led 130 men in boats, capturing a lieutenant and 38 privates of the Third [[South Carolina]] Cavalry, six overseers of saltworks he had destroyed, and 71 slaves.

He was promoted to captain and placed on the retired list on April 4, 1867.

Colvocoresses was robbed and murdered in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] on June 3, 1872 while on his way to New York. The case was never solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futilitycloset.com/2011/01/12/an-obscure-exit/|title=An Obscure Exit|first=Greg|last=Ross|work=futilitycloset.com|date=January 12, 2011|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Colvocoresses was married twice. From his first union, with Adeline Maria Swasey, he had four children, including Frank E. and George P. His second marriage was with Eliza T. Halsey.

* His son, [[George Partridge Colvocoresses]]—named for his father's benefactor—also led a distinguished military career, rising to the rank of admiral in the U.S. Navy. He served under then-Commodore [[George Dewey]] in the [[Asiatic Fleet]], and distinguished himself in service during the [[Spanish–American War]]. His name appears on the Centennial Staircase at Norwich.
* His great-grandson, [[Alden Partridge Colvocoresses]], received the [[Purple Heart]] as well as two [[Silver Star]]s. His career spanned [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. After leaving the army, Alden was a pioneer in satellite mapping techniques, including the Space Oblique Mercator projection that maps images from Landsat satellites, which he used to develop the first satellite map of the United States.

=== Namesake ===
* [[Colvos Passage]], a tidal strait in [[Puget Sound]], was named in honor of Colvocoresses

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}

[[Image:HR-diag-instability-strip.svg|right|350px]]
The unqualified term '''instability strip''' usually refers to a region of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] largely occupied by several related classes of pulsating [[variable star]]s:&lt;ref name=pulsations&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gautschy | first1 = A. | last2 = Saio | first2 = H. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.astro.34.1.551 | title = Stellar Pulsations Across the HR Diagram: Part 2| journal = Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume = 34 | pages = 551 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1996ARA&amp;A..34..551G }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delta Scuti variable]]s, [[SX Phoenicis variable]]s, and [[rapidly oscillating Ap star]]s (roAps) near the [[main sequence]]; [[RR Lyrae variables]] where it intersects the [[horizontal branch]]; and the [[Cepheid variable]]s where it crosses the supergiants.

[[RV Tauri variable]]s are also often considered to lie on the instability strip, occupying the area to the right of the brighter Cepheids (at lower temperatures), since their pulsations are attributed to the same mechanism.

==Position on the HR diagram==
The instability strip intersects the [[main sequence]] in the region of A and F stars (1–2 [[Sun|solar]] mass ({{Solar mass|link=y}})) and extends to G and early K bright supergiants (early M if RV Tauri stars at minimum are included).  Above the main sequence, the vast majority of stars in the instability strip are variable.  Where the instability strip intersects the main sequence, the vast majority of stars are stable, but there are some variables, including the roAp stars.

==Pulsations==
Stars in the instability strip pulsate due to [[Helium|He]] III (doubly [[Ionization|ionized]] helium).&lt;ref name=pulsations/&gt; In normal A-F-G stars He is neutral in the stellar [[photosphere]]. Deeper below the photosphere, at about 25,000–30,000K, begins the He II layer (first He ionization).  Second ionization (He III) starts at about 35,000–50,000K.

When the star contracts, the [[density]] and [[temperature]] of the He II layer increases. He II starts to transform into He III (second [[ionization]]). This causes the [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] of the star to increase and the [[energy flux]] from the interior of the star is effectively absorbed. The temperature of the star rises and it begins to expand. After expansion, He III begins to recombine into He II and the opacity of the star drops. This lowers the surface temperature of the star. The outer layers contract and the cycle starts from the beginning.

The phase shift between a star's [[radius|radial]] pulsations and [[Apparent magnitude|brightness]] variations depends on the distance of He II zone from the stellar surface in the [[stellar atmosphere]]. For most Cepheids, this creates a distinctly asymmetrical observed light curve, rising rapidly to maximum and falling slowly back down to minimum.

==Other pulsating stars==
There are several types of pulsating star not found on the instability strip and with pulsations driven by different mechanisms.  At cooler temperatures are the [[long period variable]] [[Asymptotic giant branch|AGB]] stars.  At hotter temperatures are the [[Beta Cephei variable|Beta Cephei]] and [[PV Telescopii variable|PV Telescopii]], variables.  Right at the edge of the instability strip near the main sequence are [[Gamma Doradus variables]].  The band of [[White dwarfs]] has three separate regions types of variable: DOV, DBV, and DAV (= [[ZZ Ceti variables]]) white dwarfs.  Each of these types of pulsating variable has an associated instability strip&lt;ref name=v777&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beauchamp | first1 = A. | last2 = Wesemael | first2 = F. | last3 = Bergeron | first3 = P. | last4 = Fontaine | first4 = G. | last5 = Saffer | first5 = R.

Most high luminosity supergiants are somewhat variable, including the [[Alpha Cygni variables]].  In the specific region of more luminous stars above the instability strip are found the [[yellow hypergiant]]s which have irregular pulsations and eruptions.  The hotter [[luminous blue variable]]s may be related and show similar short- and long-term [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectral]] and brightness variations with irregular eruptions.

The IAG also carries out the certification of geological and environmental [[certified reference materials|reference materials]] in accordance with its own [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-908X.2003.tb00724.x/abstract Certification Protocol],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tWbr6mlow_sC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=international+association+of+geoanalysts#v=onepage&amp;q=international%20association%20of%20geoanalysts&amp;f=false | title = Issues in Earth Sciences, Geology, and Geophysics: 2012 Edition | page=163 |isbn = 9781481645355 | date = 2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and holds liaison membership of [http://www.iso.org/iso/fr/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=55002&amp;published=on&amp;includesc=true ISO-REMCO] to represent the views of the geochemical research community particularly in matters of [[metrology]].

The IAG has a legal-commercial arm, IAGeo Limited,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iageo.com/about_us.html IAGeo Limited]&lt;/ref&gt; which distributes, markets and develops reference materials for scientific research.

== History ==

The International Association of Geoanalysts was founded on 2 June 1997 during the 'Geoanalysis 97' Conference held at Vail, Colorado, USA. It is a successor organisation to the International Working Group-Groupe International de Travail (IWG-GIT) on geochemical reference materials, which operated under the direction of Dr K. Govindaraju at the [http://www.crpg.cnrs-nancy.fr/index.php CRPG], Nancy (France) from 1977 to its dissolution in 1996, and which was closely associated with the journal [[Geostandards and Geoanalytical Research|Geostandards Newsletter]].

== Governance ==

The IAG is directed by a fifteen-member council, the current president of which is Professor Thomas C. Meisel (Montanuniversität Leoben, Austria). The past presidents of the association are: Douglas L. Miles (formerly of the British Geological Survey), Philip J. Potts (The Open University, UK) and Michael Wiedenbeck (Helmholtz-Zentrum Potsdam, Germany).

== Publications ==

The IAG is an editorial partner of the quarterly journal ''[[Geostandards and Geoanalytical Research]]'' published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geostandards and Geoanalytical Research - Society Information - Wiley Online Library|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1751-908X/homepage/Society.html|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association is also a joint publishing partner of [[Elements: An International Magazine of Mineralogy, Geochemistry, and Petrology|Elements]] - an International Magazine of Mineralogy, Geochemistry and Petrology.

== Specialist sub committees ==

The association has a number of special interest groups dealing with its core activities. These are:
* Certification and Reference Material Committee
* Steering Committee for the GeoPT proficiency testing programme
* Steering Committee for the G-Probe proficiency testing programme
* [[Geochronology]] Interest Group

== Conferences and workshops ==

The IAG is the main sponsor of the triennial '''Geoanalysis''' conference – an international meeting series that has taken place since 1990. Scientific proceedings of the Geoanalysis conferences are published in [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1751-908X/homepage/virtual_special_issues.htm Geostandards and Geoanalytical Research]. The IAG also organises short courses on [[Quality Assurance]] in geoanalysis as well as workshops dealing with [[isotope geochemistry|isotope determination]] in [[geochemistry]].

== Awards ==

The IAG dispenses an annual Early Career Researcher Award for excellence in analytical geochemistry. Eligibility is limited to scientists who are currently pursuing a higher degree in a field related to geoanalysis or who have completed their university education within the past five years. The award promotes the careers of young scientists who have either developed innovative analytical methods or provided new strategies to improve data quality as applied to the chemical analysis of geological or environmental samples.

[[Electron ionization]] is widely used in mass spectrometry, particularly for [[organic chemistry|organic]] molecules. The [[Phase (matter)|gas phase]] reaction producing electron ionization is

:&lt;chem&gt;M{} + e^- -&gt; M^{+\bullet}{} + 2e^- &lt;/chem&gt;

where M is the atom or molecule being ionized, &lt;chem&gt;e^-&lt;/chem&gt; is the electron, and &lt;chem&gt;M^{+\bullet}&lt;/chem&gt; is the resulting ion.

The electrons may be created by an [[arc discharge]] between a [[cathode]] and an [[anode]].

An electron beam ion source (EBIS) is used in [[atomic physics]] to produce highly charged [[ion]]s by bombarding [[atom]]s with a powerful [[electron beam]].&lt;ref name="Brown2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian G. Brown|title=The Physics and Technology of Ion Sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cdjGzG_zBLwC|date=6 March 2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-60454-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BeyerBeyer1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Heinrich Beyer|author2=Heinrich F.

===Electron capture ionization===
Electron capture ionization (ECI) is the ionization of a gas phase [[atom]] or [[molecule]] by attachment of an [[electron]] to create an ion of the form A&lt;sup&gt;−•&lt;/sup&gt;. The reaction is

:&lt;chem&gt;A + e^- -&gt;[M] A^-&lt;/chem&gt;

where the M over the arrow denotes that to conserve [[energy]] and [[momentum]] a third body is required (the [[molecularity]] of the reaction is three).

Electron capture can be used in conjunction with [[chemical ionization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1021/ac50035a017 | title = Electron capture negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry | year = 1978 |author1=Donald F.  Hunt |author2=Frank W.  Crow | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 13 | pages = 1781–1784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[electron capture detector]] is used in some [[gas chromatography]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=electron capture detector (in gas chromatography)|file= E01981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical ionization==
{{Main|Chemical ionization}}
[[Chemical ionization]] (CI) is a lower energy process than [[electron ionization]] because it involves ion/molecule reactions rather than electron removal.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, M.S.B.; Field, F.H. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1966''', ''88'', 2621-2630. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja00964a001 Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry. I. General Introduction].&lt;/ref&gt;  The lower energy yields less [[fragmentation (chemistry)|fragmentation]], and usually a simpler [[spectrum]].  A typical CI spectrum has an easily identifiable molecular ion.&lt;ref name="MSPA"&gt;{{cite book|last=de Hoffmann|first=Edmond|author2=Vincent Stroobant|title=Mass Spectrometry:  Principles and Applications|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|location=Toronto|date=2003|edition=Second|page=14| isbn = 978-0-471-48566-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a CI experiment, ions are produced through the collision of the analyte with ions of a reagent gas in the ion source.  Some common reagent gases include:  [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[isobutane]].  Inside the ion source, the reagent gas is present in large excess compared to the analyte.  Electrons entering the source will preferentially ionize the reagent gas.  The resultant collisions with other reagent gas molecules will create an ionization [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].  Positive and negative ions of the analyte are formed by reactions with this plasma. For example, [[protonation]] occurs by

:&lt;chem&gt;CH4 + e^- -&gt; CH4+ + 2e^-&lt;/chem&gt; (primary ion formation),

:&lt;chem&gt;CH4 + CH4+ -&gt; CH5+ + CH3&lt;/chem&gt; (reagent ion formation),

:&lt;chem&gt;M + CH5+ -&gt; CH4 + [M + H]+&lt;/chem&gt; 	(product ion formation, e.g. protonation).

===Charge exchange ionization===
Charge-exchange ionization (also known as charge-transfer ionization) is a gas phase reaction between an [[ion]] and an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] in which the charge of the ion is transferred to the neutral species.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=charge-exchange ionization|file= C00989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;A+ + B -&gt; A + B+&lt;/chem&gt;

===Chemi-ionization===
Chemi-ionization is the formation of an [[ion]] through the reaction of a gas phase [[atom]] or [[molecule]] with an atom or molecule in an [[excited state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=chemi-ionization|file= C01044}} C01044&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Klucharev1993&gt;{{citation | last = Klucharev | first =  A.

:&lt;chem&gt;G^\ast{} + M -&gt; M^{+\bullet}{} + e^- + G&lt;/chem&gt;
where G is the excited state species (indicated by the superscripted asterisk), and M is the species that is ionized by the loss of an [[electron]] to form the [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] [[cation]] (indicated by the superscripted "plus-dot").

===Associative ionization===
Associative ionization is a gas phase reaction in which two atoms or molecules interact to form a single product ion.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=associative ionization|file= A00475}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |author=Jones DM, Dahler JS |title=Theory of associative ionization  |date=April 1988 |pmid=9900022 |journal=[[Physical Review A]]|volume=37|issue=8 |pages=2916–2933|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevA.37.2916|bibcode = 1988PhRvA..37.2916J |last2=Dahler  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cohen | first =  James S. | date = 1976 | title = Multistate curve-crossing model for scattering: Associative ionization and excitation transfer in helium | journal = Physical Review A | volume = 13 | issue =  1 | pages = 99–114 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.13.99 |bibcode = 1976PhRvA..13...99C }}&lt;/ref&gt; One or both of the interacting species may have excess [[internal energy]].

For example,

:&lt;chem&gt;A^\ast{} + B -&gt; AB^{+\bullet}{} + e^-&lt;/chem&gt;

where species A with excess internal energy (indicated by the asterisk) interacts with B to form the ion AB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Penning ionization===
{{Main|Penning ionization}}
[[Penning ionization]] is a form of chemi-ionization involving reactions between neutral atoms or molecules.&lt;ref name="pmid17155624"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arango CA, Shapiro M, Brumer P |title=Cold atomic collisions: coherent control of penning and associative ionization |journal=Phys.

M. ''Die Naturwissenschaften'', 1927, '''15''', 818.  ''Über Ionisation durch metastabile Atome.''&lt;/ref&gt; Penning ionization involves a reaction between a gas-phase excited-state atom or molecule G&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and a target molecule M resulting in the formation of a radical molecular cation M&lt;sup&gt;+.&lt;/sup&gt;, an electron e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and a neutral gas molecule G:&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Penning gas mixture|file= P04476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;G^\ast{} + M -&gt; M^{+\bullet}{} + e^- + G&lt;/chem&gt;

Penning ionization occurs when the target molecule has an [[ionization potential]] lower than the internal energy of the excited-state atom or molecule.

Associative Penning ionization can proceed via

:&lt;chem&gt;G^\ast{} + M -&gt; MG^{+\bullet}{} + e^-&lt;/chem&gt;

Surface Penning ionization (also known as Auger deexcitation) refers to the interaction of the excited-state gas with a bulk surface S, resulting in the release of an electron according to

:&lt;chem&gt;G^\ast{} + S -&gt; G{} + S{} + e^-&lt;/chem&gt;.

===Ion attachment===
{{Main|Ion attachment mass spectrometry}}
[[Ion attachment mass spectrometry|Ion-attachment ionization]] is similar to [[chemical ionization]] in which a cation is attached to the analyte molecule in a reactive collision:
:&lt;chem&gt;M + X+ + A -&gt; MX+ + A&lt;/chem&gt;

Where M is the analyte molecule, X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the cation and A is a non-reacting collision partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lithium ion attachment mass spectrometry: Instrumentation and features|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=72|issue=5|page=2248|id= |url=|bibcode=2001RScI...72.2248S|author1=Selvin|first1=P. Christopher|last2=Fujii|first2=Toshihiro|date=2001|doi=10.1063/1.1362439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a radioactive ion source, a small piece of radioactive material, for instance &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;[[Nickel|Ni]] or &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;[[Americium|Am]], is used to ionize a gas.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} This is used in ionization [[smoke detector]]s and [[ion mobility spectrometer]]s.

==Gas-discharge ion sources==
[[File:NASA NEXT Ion thruster.712983main NEXT LDT Thrusterhi-res full.jpg|thumb|300px|NASA's [[NEXT (ion thruster)]] space craft propulsion system]]
These ion sources use a [[plasma source]] or [[electric discharge]] to create ions.

===Inductively-coupled plasma===
{{Main|inductively coupled plasma}}
Ions can be created in an [[inductively coupled plasma]], which is a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] source in which the [[energy]] is supplied by [[electrical current]]s which are produced by [[electromagnetic induction]], that is, by time-varying [[magnetic field]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A. Montaser and D. W. Golightly, eds. Inductively Coupled Plasmas in Analytical Atomic Spectrometry, VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microwave-induced plasma===
Microwave induced plasma ion sources are capable of exciting electrodeless gas discharges to create ions for trace element mass spectrometry.&lt;ref name="Okamoto1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Okamoto|first1=Yukio|title=High-sensitivity microwave-induced plasma mass spectrometry for trace element analysis|journal=Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry|volume=9|issue=7|date=1994|page=745|issn=0267-9477|doi=10.1039/ja9940900745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DouglasFrench1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Douglas|first1=D.

It is capable of exciting [[electrode]]less [[gas discharge]]s. If applied in [[surface-wave-sustained mode]], they are especially well suited to generate large-area plasmas of high plasma density. If they are both in [[surface-wave-sustained mode|surface-wave]] and [[resonator mode]], they can exhibit a high degree of spatial localization. This allows to spatially separate the location of plasma generations from the location of surface processing. Such a separation (together with an appropriate gas-flow scheme) may help reduce the negative effect, that particles released from a processed substrate may have on the [[plasma chemistry]] of the [[gas phase]].

===ECR ion source===
{{Main|electron cyclotron resonance#ECR ion sources}}
The ECR ion source makes use of the [[electron cyclotron resonance]] to ionize a plasma. Microwaves are injected into a volume at the frequency corresponding to the electron cyclotron resonance, defined by the magnetic field applied to a region inside the volume. The volume contains a low pressure gas.

===Glow discharge===
{{Main|glow discharge}}
Ions can be created in an electric [[glow discharge]]. A glow discharge is a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] formed by the passage of [[electric current]] through a low-pressure gas. It is created by applying a voltage between two metal [[electrode]]s in an evacuated chamber containing gas. When the voltage exceeds a certain value, called the [[striking voltage]], the gas forms a plasma.

A [[duoplasmatron]] is a type of glow discharge ion source that consists of a [[hot cathode]] or cold [[cathode]] that produces a plasma that is used to ionize a gas.&lt;ref name="Wolf1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lejeune1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lejeune|first1=C.|title=Theoretical and experimental study of the duoplasmatron ion source|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods|volume=116|issue=3|date=1974|pages=417–428|issn=0029-554X|doi=10.1016/0029-554X(74)90821-0|bibcode=1974NucIM.116..417L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duoplasmatrons can produce positive or negative ions.&lt;ref name="Aberth1967"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aberth|first1=William|last2=Peterson|first2=James R.|title=Characteristics of a Low Energy Duoplasmatron Negative Ion Source|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=38|issue=6|date=1967|page=745|issn=0034-6748|doi=10.1063/1.1720882|bibcode=1967RScI...38..745A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duoplasmatrons are used for secondary ion mass spectrometry.,&lt;ref name="CoathLong1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coath|first1=C.

===Flowing afterglow===
{{Main|plasma afterglow}}
In a flowing [[plasma afterglow|afterglow]], ions are formed in a flow of inert gas, typically [[helium]] or [[argon]].&lt;ref name="FergusonFehsenfeld1969"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=E.

===Spark ionization===
{{Main|spark ionization}}
Electric [[spark ionization]] is used to produce gas phase [[ion]]s from a solid sample. When incorporated with a mass spectrometer the complete instrument is referred to as a spark ionization mass spectrometer or as a spark source mass spectrometer (SSMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=H. E. Beske |author2=A. Hurrle |author3=K. P. Jochum | title = Part I. Principles of spark source mass spectrometry (SSMS) | date = 1981 | journal = [[Fresenius' Journal of Analytical Chemistry]] | volume = 309 | issue = 4 | pages = 258–261 | doi = 10.1007/BF00488596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A closed drift ion source uses a radial magnetic field in an annular cavity in order to confine electrons for ionizing a gas. They are used for [[ion implantation]] and for space propulsion ([[Hall effect thruster]]s).

==Photoionization==
{{Main|Photoionization}}
[[Photoionization]] is the ionization process in which an ion is formed from the interaction of a [[photon]] with an atom or molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=photoionization|file=P04620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-photon ionization===
In multi-photon ionization (MPI), several photons of energy below the ionization threshold may actually combine their energies to ionize an atom.

[[Resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization]] (REMPI) is a form of MPI in which one or more of the photons accesses a [[bound-bound transition]] that is [[resonant]] in the atom or molecule being ionized.

===Atmospheric pressure photoionization===
Atmospheric pressure photoionization uses a source of photons, usually a vacuum UV (VUV) lamp, to ionize the analyte with single photon ionization process. Analogous to other atmospheric pressure ion sources, a spray of solvent is heated to relatively high temperatures (above 400 degrees Celsius) and sprayed with high flow rates of nitrogen for desolvation. The resulting [[aerosol]] is subjected to UV radiation to create ions. [[Atmospheric pressure laser ionization]] uses UV laser light sources to ionize the analyte via MPI.

==Desorption ionization==

===Field desorption===
{{Main|Field desorption}}
[[File:Field desorption.gif|thumb|300px|Field desorption schematic]]
[[Field desorption]] refers to an ion source in which a high-potential electric field is applied to an emitter with a sharp surface, such as a razor blade, or more commonly, a filament from which tiny "whiskers" have formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beckey | first1 = H.D. | date =1969 | title = Field ionization mass spectrometry |journal=Research/Development | volume = 20 | issue = 11| page = 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This results in a very high electric field which can result in ionization of gaseous molecules of the analyte.  Mass spectra produced by FI have little or no fragmentation.  They are dominated by molecular radical cations &lt;chem&gt;M^{+.}&lt;/chem&gt; and less often, protonated molecules &lt;chem&gt;[{M}+H]+&lt;/chem&gt;.

===Particle bombardment===

====Fast atom bombardment====
{{Main|fast atom bombardment}}
Particle bombardment with atoms is called [[fast atom bombardment]] (FAB) and bombardment with atomic or molecular ions is called [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS).&lt;ref name="WilliamsFindeis1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Dudley H.|last2=Findeis|first2=A. Frederick|last3=Naylor|first3=Stephen|last4=Gibson|first4=Bradford W.|title=Aspects of the production of FAB and SIMS mass spectra|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=109|issue=7|date=1987|pages=1980–1986|issn=0002-7863|doi=10.1021/ja00241a013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fission fragment ionization uses ionic or neutral atoms formed as a result of the [[nuclear fission]] of a suitable [[nuclide]], for example the [[Californium]] isotope &lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt;Cf.

In FAB the analytes is mixed with a non-volatile chemical protection environment called a [[Matrix Isolation|matrix]] and is bombarded under vacuum with a high energy (4000 to 10,000 [[electron volts]]) beam of atoms.&lt;ref name="pmid7306100"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Morris HR, Panico M, Barber M, Bordoli RS, Sedgwick RD, Tyler A | title = Fast atom bombardment: a new mass spectrometric method for peptide sequence analysis | journal = Biochem.

Common matrices include [[glycerol]], [[thioglycerol]], [[3-nitrobenzyl alcohol]] (3-NBA), [[18-crown-6]] ether, [[2-nitrophenyloctyl ether]], [[sulfolane]], [[diethanolamine]], and [[triethanolamine]]. This technique is similar to [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] and [[plasma desorption mass spectrometry]].

====Secondary ionization====
Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is used to analyze the composition of solid surfaces and thin films by sputtering the surface of the specimen with a focused primary ion beam and collecting and analyzing ejected secondary ions. The mass/charge ratios of these secondary ions are measured with a mass spectrometer to determine the elemental, isotopic, or molecular composition of the surface to a depth of 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;nm.

In a [[liquid metal ion source]] (LMIS), a metal (typically [[gallium]]) is heated to the liquid state and provided at the end of a capillary or a needle. Then a [[Taylor cone]] is formed under the application of a strong electric field. As the cone's tip get sharper, the electric field becomes stronger, until ions are produced by field evaporation. These ion sources are particularly used in [[ion implantation]] or in [[focused ion beam]] instruments.

====Plasma desorption ionization====
[[File:pdms inst.gif|thumb|300px|Schematic representation of a plasama desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometer]]
Plasma desorption ionization mass spectrometry (PDMS), also called fission fragment ionization, is a mass spectrometry technique in which ionization of material in a solid sample is accomplished by bombarding it with ionic or neutral atoms formed as a result of the [[nuclear fission]] of a suitable [[nuclide]], typically the [[californium]] isotope &lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt;Cf.&lt;ref name="MacfarlaneTorgerson1976"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macfarlane|first1=R.|last2=Torgerson|first2=D.|title=Californium-252 plasma desorption mass spectroscopy|journal=Science|volume=191|issue=4230|date=1976|pages=920–925|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.1251202|pmid=1251202|bibcode=1976Sci...191..920M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hilf1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilf|first1=E.R.|title=Approaches to plasma desorption mass spectrometry by some theoretical physics concepts|journal=International Journal of Mass Spectrometry and Ion Processes|volume=126|date=1993|pages=25–36|issn=0168-1176|doi=10.1016/0168-1176(93)80067-O|bibcode=1993IJMSI.126...25H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laser desorption ionization===
[[File:Maldi.PNG|thumb|300px|Diagram of a MALDI ion source]]
[[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI) is a soft ionization technique. The sample is mixed with a matrix material. Upon receiving a laser pulse, the matrix absorbs the laser energy and it is thought that primarily the matrix is desorbed and ionized (by addition of a proton) by this event.

==Spray ionization==

Solvent-assisted ionization (SAI) is a method in which charged droplets are produced by introducing a solution containing analyte into a heated inlet tube of an atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometer.  Just as in Electrospray Ionization (ESI), desolvation of the charged droplets produces multiply charged analyte ions. Volatile and nonvolatile compounds are analyzed by SAI, and high voltage is not  required to achieve sensitivity comparable to ESI.&lt;ref name="Pagnotti2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pagnotti, VS, Chubatyi, ND, McEwen, CN |journal=Anal. Chem. |title=Solvent Assisted Inlet Ionization: an Ultrasensitive New Liquid Introduction Ionization Method for Mass Spectrometry |volume=83 |issue=11 |pages=3981–3985 |date=2011 |doi=10.1021/ac200556z |pmid=21528896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of a voltage to the solution entering the hot inlet through a zero dead volume fitting connected to fused silica tubing produces ESI-like mass spectra, but with higher sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Pagnotti2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pagnotti, VS, Chakrabarty, S, harron, AF, McEwen, CN |title=Increasing the Sensitivity of Liquid Introduction Mass Spectrometry by Combining Electrospray Ionization and Solvent Assisted Inlet Ionization |journal=Anal.

===Matrix-Assisted Ionization===
Matrix-Assisted Ionization [MAI] is similar to MALDI in sample preparation, but a laser is not required to convert analyte molecules included in a matrix compound into gas-phase ions.  In MAI, analyte ions have charge states similar to electrospray ionization but obtained from a solid matrix rather than a solvent.  No voltage or laser is required, but a laser can be used to obtain spatial resolution for imaging.  Matrix-analyte samples are ionized in the vacuum of a mass spectrometer and can be inserted into the vacuum through an atmospheric pressure inlet. Less volatile matrices such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid require a hot inlet tube to produce analyte ions by MAI, but more volatile matrices such as 3-nitrobenzonitrile require no heat, voltage, or laser.  Simply introducing the matrix:analyte sample to the inlet aperture of an atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometer produces abundant ions. Compounds at least as large as bovine serum albumin [66 kDa] can be ionized with this method.&lt;ref name="Trimpin2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author=trimpin, S, Wang, B, Lietz, CB, Marshall, DD, Richards, AL, Inutan, ED |title=New Ionization Processes and Applications for Use in Mass Spectrometry |journal=Rev.

===Electrospray ionization===
{{Main|Electrospray ionization}}
In [[electrospray ionization]], a [[liquid]] is pushed through a very small, charged and usually [[metal]], [[capillary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/mas.1280090103 |author1=Fenn, J.

M. | title = Electrospray Ionization-Principles and Practice | journal = [[Mass Spectrometry Reviews]] | date = 1990 | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–70|bibcode = 1990MSRv....9...37F }}&lt;/ref&gt; This liquid contains the substance to be studied, the [[analyte]], dissolved in a large amount of [[solvent]], which is usually much more [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] than the analyte. Volatile [[acid]]s, [[base (chemistry)|bases]] or [[buffer (chemistry)|buffers]] are often added to this solution too. The analyte exists as an [[ion]] in solution either in its anion or cation form. Because like [[electric charge|charges]] repel, the liquid pushes itself out of the capillary and forms an [[Particulate|aerosol]], a mist of small droplets about 10 [[micro-|&amp;mu;m]] across. The aerosol is at least partially produced by a process involving the formation of a [[Taylor cone]] and a jet from the tip of this cone. An uncharged carrier gas such as [[nitrogen]] is sometimes used to help [[nebulizer|nebulize]] the liquid and to help [[evaporate]] the neutral solvent in the droplets. As the solvent evaporates, the analyte molecules are forced closer together, repel each other and break up the droplets. This process is called Coulombic fission because it is driven by repulsive [[Coulombic force]]s between charged molecules. The process repeats until the analyte is free of solvent and is a bare [[ion]]. The ions observed are created by the addition of a [[proton]] (a hydrogen ion) and denoted &lt;chem&gt;[{M}+H]+&lt;/chem&gt;, or of another [[cation]] such as [[sodium]] ion, &lt;chem&gt;[M + Na]+&lt;/chem&gt;, or the removal of a proton, &lt;chem&gt;[M - H]^-&lt;/chem&gt;. Multiply charged ions such as &lt;chem&gt;[{M}+2H]^2+&lt;/chem&gt; are often observed. For large [[macromolecules]], there can be many charge states, occurring with different frequencies; the charge can be as great as &lt;chem&gt;[M + 25H]^{25+}&lt;/chem&gt;, for example.

==Thermal ionization==
{{Main|Thermal ionization}}
[[Thermal ionization]] (also known as surface ionization, or contact ionization) involves spraying vaporized, neutral atoms onto a hot surface, from which the atoms re-evaporate in ionic form. To generate positive ions, the atomic species should have a low [[ionization energy]], and the surface should have a high [[work function]]. This technique is most suitable for [[alkali metal|alkali]] atoms (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) which have low ionization energies and are easily evaporated.&lt;ref name="Alton1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alton|first1=G.

The action of the primary droplets hitting the surface produces secondary droplets that are the source of ions for the mass spectrometer. Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) uses an [[electrospray]] source to create charged droplets that are directed at a solid sample a few millimeters to a few centimeters away.

Plasma-based ambient ionization is based on an [[electrical discharge]] in a flowing gas that produces metastable atoms and molecules and reactive ions. Heat is often used to assist in the desorption of volatile species from the sample. Ions are formed by [[chemical ionization]] in the gas phase. A [[DART ion source|direct analysis in real time]] source operates by exposing the sample to a dry gas stream (typically helium or nitrogen) that contains long-lived electronically or vibronically excited neutral [[atoms]] or [[molecules]] (or [[Metastability in molecules|"metastables"]]).  [[Excited state]]s are typically formed in the DART source by creating a [[glow discharge]] in a chamber through which the gas flows. A similar method called atmospheric solids analysis probe [ASAP] uses the heated gas from ESI or APCI probes to vaporize sample placed on a melting point tube inserted into an ESI/APCI source.&lt;ref name="McEwen2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author = McEwen, CN, McKay, RG, Larsen, BS |title=Analysis of Solids, Liquids, and Biological Tissues Using Solids Probe Introduction at Atmospheric Pressure on Commercial LC/MS Instruments |journal=Anal.

An ultraviolet or infrared laser is directed onto a solid or liquid sample containing the analyte of interest and matrix desorbing neutral analyte molecules that are ionized by interaction with electrosprayed solvent droplets generating multiply charged ions.

==Applications==

===Mass spectrometry===
In a [[mass spectrometer]] a sample is ionized in an ion source and the resulting ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio. The ions are detected and the results are displayed as spectra of the relative abundance of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern.

===Particle accelerators===
[[File:CARIBU at ATLAS.jpg|thumb|300px|Surface ionization source at the [[Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System]] (ATLAS)]]
[[File:Ion source at used in the Cockcroft-Walton accelerators at Fermilab.jpg|thumb|Ion source used in the [[Cockcroft-Walton generator|Cockcroft-Walton]] pre-accelerator at [[Fermilab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=35 years of H- ions at Fermilab|publisher=Fermilab|pages=12|url=http://www-ad.fnal.gov/proton/PIP/Communicate/Calendar/Repository/2014/35%20years%20of%20H-%20ions%20at%20Fermilab.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[particle accelerator]]s an ion source creates a [[particle beam]] at the beginning of the machine, the ''source''. The technology to create ion sources for particle accelerators depends strongly on the type of particle that needs to be generated: [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, [[Hydride|H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion]] or a [[Heavy ions]].

Electrons are generated with an [[electron gun]], and there are many varieties of these.

Protons are generated with a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]-based device, like a [[duoplasmatron]] or a [[magnetron]].

[[hydride|H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] ions are generated with a [[magnetron]] or a [[Penning ionization|Penning]] source.  A magnetron consists of a central cylindrical cathode surrounded by an anode. The discharge voltage is typically greater than 150 V and the current drain is around 40 A. A [[magnetic field]] of about 0.2 [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] is parallel to the [[cathode]] axis.  Hydrogen gas is introduced by a pulsed gas valve.  [[Caesium]] is often used to lower the [[work function]] of the cathode, enhancing the amount of ions that are produced.

For a  [[Penning ionization|Penning source]], a strong magnetic field parallel to the electric field of the sheath guides electrons and ions on cyclotron spirals from cathode to cathode. Fast H-minus ions are generated at the cathodes as in the magnetron. They are slowed down due to the charge exchange reaction as they migrate to the plasma aperture. This makes for a beam of ions that is colder than the ions obtained from a magnetron.

[[Heavy ions]] can be generated with an [[electron cyclotron resonance]] ion source.  The use of electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion sources for the production of intense beams of highly charged ions has immensely grown over the last decade. ECR ion sources are used as injectors into linear accelerators, Van-de-Graaff generators or cyclotrons in nuclear and elementary particle physics. In atomic and surface physics ECR ion sources deliver intense beams of highly charged ions for collision experiments or for the investigation of surfaces. For the highest charge states, however, [[Electron beam ion source]]s (EBIS) are needed. They can generate even bare ions of mid-heavy elements. The [[Electron beam ion trap]] (EBIT), based on the same principle, can produce up to bare uranium ions and can be used as an ion source as well.

[[Heavy ions]] can also be generated with an [[Ion Gun]] which typically uses the thermionic emission of electrons to ionize a substance in its gaseous state. Such instruments are typically used for surface analysis.[[File:Ion implanter schematic.png|thumb|300px|Ion beam deposition system with mass separator]]

Gas flows through the ion source between the [[anode]] and the [[cathode]].  A positive [[voltage]] is applied to the anode.  This voltage, combined with the high [[magnetic field]] between the tips of the internal and external cathodes allow a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] to start.  [[Ions]] from the plasma are repelled by the anode [[electric field]].  This creates an ion beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.advanced-energy.com/en/upload/File/Sources/SL-ION-230-02.pdf |title=Ion Beam Sources |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5767 |pages=1566–70 |accessdate=2006-12-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018152802/http://www.advanced-energy.com/en/upload/File/Sources/SL-ION-230-02.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-18 |bibcode=2006Sci...311.1566C |deadurl=yes |df= |doi = 10.1126/science.1119426 |pmid=16543450 |year=2006 |last1=Cooks |first1=R.

Landau damping occurs because of the energy exchange between an electromagnetic [[wave]] with phase velocity &lt;math&gt;v_\text{ph}&lt;/math&gt; and particles in the plasma with velocity approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;v_\text{ph}&lt;/math&gt;, which can interact strongly with the wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsurutani | first1 = B. | last2 = Lakhina | first2 = G. | year = 1997| title = Some basic concepts of wave–particle interactions in collisionless plasmas | url = http://download.scientificcommons.org/442719 | journal = Reviews of Geophysics | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 491–502 | doi=10.1029/97rg02200 | bibcode=1997RvGeo..35..491T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those particles having velocities slightly less than &lt;math&gt;v_\text{ph}&lt;/math&gt; will be accelerated by the electric field of the wave to move with the wave phase velocity, while those particles with velocities slightly greater than &lt;math&gt;v_\text{ph}&lt;/math&gt; will be decelerated losing energy to the wave: particles tend to synchronize with the wave. This is proved experimentally with a [[Traveling-wave tube]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doveil|first=F.|last2=Escande|first2=D.

In an ideal MHD plasma the particle velocities are often taken to be approximately a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian distribution function]]. 
If the slope of the function is negative, the number of particles with velocities slightly less than the wave phase velocity is greater than the number of particles with velocities slightly greater. Hence, there are more particles gaining energy from the wave than losing to the wave, which leads to wave damping.
If, however, the slope of the function is positive, the number of particles with velocities slightly less than the wave phase velocity is smaller than the number of particles with velocities slightly greater. Hence, there are more particles losing energy to the wave than gaining from the wave, which leads to a resultant increase in the wave energy.

== Physical interpretation ==

The mathematical theory of Landau damping is somewhat involved—see the section below. However, there is a simple physical interpretation [introduced in section 7.5 of &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with a caveat], which, though not strictly correct, helps to visualize this phenomenon.

[[File:Phys interp landau damp.svg|thumb]]

It is possible to imagine [[Plasma oscillation|Langmuir waves]] as waves in the sea, and the particles as surfers trying to catch the wave, all moving in the same direction. If the surfer is moving on the water surface at a velocity slightly less than the waves he will eventually be caught and pushed along the wave (gaining energy), while a surfer moving slightly faster than a wave will be pushing on the wave as he moves uphill (losing energy to the wave).

It is worth noting that only the surfers are playing an important role in this energy interactions with the waves; a beachball floating on the water (zero velocity) will go up and down as the wave goes by, not gaining energy at all. Also, a boat that moves very fast (faster than the waves) does not exchange much energy with the wave.

A simple mechanical description of particle dynamics provides a quantitative estimate of the synchronization of particles with the wave [Equation (1) of &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;]. A more rigorous approach shows the strongest synchronization occurs for particles with a velocity in the wave frame proportional to the damping rate and independent of the wave amplitude [section 4.1.3 of &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Microscopic Dynamics of Plasmas and Chaos|journal = Microscopic Dynamics of Plasmas and Chaos. Series: Series in Plasma Physics|volume = 12|last=Escande|first=Dominique|last2=Elskens|first2=Yves|date=2002-10-23|isbn=9780750306126|series=Series in Plasma Physics|doi=10.1201/9781420033953|bibcode=2002SPP....12.....E}}&lt;/ref&gt;]. Since Landau damping occurs for waves with arbitrarily small amplitudes, this shows the most active particles in this damping are far from being trapped. This is natural, since trapping involves diverging time scales for such waves (specifically &lt;math&gt;T_\text{trap} \sim A^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt; for a wave amplitude &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;).

== Theoretical physics: perturbation theory in a Vlasovian frame ==

Theoretical treatment starts with the [[Vlasov equation]] in the non-relativistic zero-magnetic field limit, the Vlasov–Poisson set of equations. Explicit solutions are obtained in the limit of a small &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;-field. The distribution function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and field &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; are expanded in a series: &lt;math&gt; f=f_0(v)+f_1(x,v,t)+f_2(x,v,t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E=E_1(x,t)+E_2(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; and terms of equal order are collected.

To '''first order''' the Vlasov–Poisson equations read

:&lt;math&gt;(\partial_t + v\partial_x)f_1 + {e\over m}E_1 f'_0 = 0, \quad 
 \partial_x E_1 = {e\over \epsilon_0} \int f_1 \mathrm{d}v&lt;/math&gt;.

Landau calculated&lt;ref name="orig" /&gt; the wave caused by an initial disturbance &lt;math&gt;f_1(x,v,0) = g(v)\exp(ikx)&lt;/math&gt; and found by aid of [[Laplace transform]] and [[contour integration]] a damped travelling wave of the form &lt;math&gt;\exp[ik(x-v_\text{ph}t)-\gamma t]&lt;/math&gt; with [[wave number]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and damping decrement

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma\approx-{\pi\omega_p^3 \over 2k^2N} f'_0(v_\text{ph}), \quad
  N = \int f_0 \mathrm{d}v&lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt;\omega_p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[plasma oscillation]] frequency and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the electron density. Later [[Nico van Kampen]] proved&lt;ref&gt;van Kampen, N. G., "On the theory of stationary waves in plasma", ''Physica'' 21 (1955), 949–963. See http://theor.jinr.ru/~kuzemsky/kampenbio.html&lt;/ref&gt; that the same result can be obtained with [[Fourier transform]]. He showed that the linearized Vlasov–Poisson equations have a continuous spectrum of singular normal modes, now known as '''van Kampen modes'''

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_p^2}{kN} f'_0 \frac{\mathcal P}{kv-\omega} + \epsilon \delta\left(v-\frac{\omega}{k}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; signifies principal value, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the delta function (see [[generalized function]]) and

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 1 + \frac{\omega_p^2}{kN} \int f'_0 \frac{\mathcal P}{\omega-kv} \mathrm{d}v&lt;/math&gt;

is the plasma permittivity. Decomposing the initial disturbance in these modes he obtained the Fourier spectrum of the resulting wave. Damping is explained by phase-mixing of these Fourier modes with slightly different frequencies near &lt;math&gt;\omega_p&lt;/math&gt;.

It was not clear how damping could occur in a collisionless plasma: where does the wave energy go? In fluid theory, in which the plasma is modeled as a dispersive dielectric medium,&lt;ref&gt;Landau, L. D. and Lifshitz, E. M., ''Electrodynamics of Continuous Media'' §80, Pergamon Press (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; the energy of Langmuir waves is known: field energy multiplied by the Brillouin factor &lt;math&gt;\partial_\omega(\omega\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;.
But damping cannot be derived in this model. To calculate energy exchange of the wave with resonant electrons, Vlasov plasma theory has to be expanded to '''second order''' and problems about suitable initial conditions and secular terms arise.

[[File:Ldamp2.jpg|thumb]] In Ref.&lt;ref&gt;Best, Robert W. B., "Energy and momentum density of a Landau-damped wave packet", ''J. Plasma Phys.'' 63 (2000), 371-391&lt;/ref&gt; these problems are studied. Because calculations for an infinite wave are deficient in second order, a [[wave packet]] is analysed. Second-order initial conditions are found that suppress secular behavior and excite a wave packet of which the energy agrees with fluid theory. The figure shows the energy density of a wave packet traveling at the [[group velocity]], its energy being carried away by electrons moving at the phase velocity. Total energy, the area under the curves, is conserved.

== Mathematical theory: the Cauchy problem for perturbative solutions ==

The rigorous mathematical theory is based on solving the [[Cauchy problem]] for the evolution equation (here the partial differential Vlasov–Poisson equation) and proving estimates on the solution.

First a rather complete linearized mathematical theory has been developed since Landau.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Backus, G. "Linearized plasma oscillations in arbitrary electron distributions". ''J. Math. Phys.'' 1 (1960), 178–191, 559. Degond, P. "Spectral theory of the linearized Vlasov–Poisson equation". ''Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.'' 294, 2 (1986), 435–453. Maslov, V. P., and Fedoryuk, M. V. "The linear theory of Landau damping." ''Mat. Sb. (N.S.)'' 127(169), 4 (1985), 445–475, 559.&lt;/ref&gt;

Going beyond the linearized equation and dealing with the nonlinearity has been a longstanding problem in the mathematical theory of Landau damping. 
Previously one mathematical result at the non-linear level was the existence of a class of exponentially damped solutions of the Vlasov–Poisson equation in a circle which had been proved in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caglioti | first1 = E. | last2 = Maffei | first2 = C. | year = | title = Time asymptotics for solutions of Vlasov–Poisson equation in a circle | url = | journal = J. Statist. Phys. | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 1–2, 301–323 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by means of a scattering technique (this result has been recently extended in&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, H. J. and Velasquez J. J. L. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1512/iumj.2009.58.3835 "On the Existence of Exponentially Decreasing Solutions of the Nonlinear Landau Damping Problem"], ''Indiana Univ. Math. J.'' 68, 6 (2009), 2623–2660&lt;/ref&gt;). However these existence results do not say anything about ''which'' initial data could lead to such damped solutions.

In a recent paper&lt;ref&gt;Mouhot, C., and Villani, C. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11511-011-0068-9 "On Landau damping"], ''Acta Math.'' 207, 1 (2011), 29–201 (quoted for the [[Fields Medal]] awarded to [[Cédric Villani]] in 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; the initial data issue is solved and Landau damping is mathematically established for the first time for the non-linear Vlasov equation. It is proved that solutions starting in some neighborhood (for the analytic or Gevrey topology) of a linearly stable homogeneous stationary solution are (orbitally) stable for all times and are damped globally in time. The damping phenomenon is reinterpreted in terms of transfer of regularity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, rather than exchanges of energy. Large scale variations pass into variations of smaller and smaller scale in velocity space, corresponding to a shift of the Fourier spectrum of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. This shift, well known in linear theory, proves to hold in the non-linear case.

== Theoretical physics: perturbation theory in an N-body frame &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Escande|first=D F|last2=Doveil|first2=F|last3=Elskens|first3=Yves|title=N -body description of Debye shielding and Landau damping|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0741-3335/58/i=1/a=014040?key=crossref.140ba36afa02dbfc77fd426a59013177|journal=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion|volume=58|issue=1|doi=10.1088/0741-3335/58/1/014040|page=014040|arxiv=1506.06468|bibcode=2016PPCF...58a4040E|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
An expression of plasma permittivity analogous to the above one, but corresponding to the Laplace transform used by Landau, can be obtained simply in an N-body frame. One considers a (one-component) plasma where only electrons are present as particles, and ions just provide a uniform neutralizing background. The principle of the calculation is provided by considering the fictitious linearized motion of a single particle in a single Fourier component of its own electric field. The full calculation boils down to a summation of the corresponding result over all &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles and all Fourier components. The Vlasovian expression for the plasma permittivity is finally recovered by substituting an integral over a smooth distribution function for the discrete sum over the particles in the N-body plasma permittivity. Together with Landau damping, this mechanical approach also provides the calculation of Debye shielding, or [[Electric-field screening]], in a plasma.

This is a '''list of notable rivers of [[Mongolia]]''', arranged geographically by [[river basin]].

The Mongolian words for river are ''gol'' (''{{lang|mn|гол}}'') and ''mörön'' (''{{lang|mn|мөрөн}}''), with the latter usually used for larger rivers. The Mongolian names also occasionally have a [[genitive construction]], with the name of the river having the suffix ''-iin'' (''{{lang|mn|-ийн}}'') or ''-yn'' (''{{lang|mn|-ын}}''). For example, [[Ider River]] is ''Ideriin Gol'' ({{lang|mn|Идэрийн гол}}), having the meaning "River of Ider".

This is a list of scientists who have made statements that conflict with the scientific consensus on [[global warming]] as summarized by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and endorsed by other scientific bodies. A minority are climatologists. Nearly all publishing climate scientists (97–98%&lt;ref name="Anderegg"/&gt;) support the consensus on anthropogenic climate change,&lt;ref name=doran&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Doran |first1=Peter |authorlink1=Peter Doran |last2=Zimmerman |first2=Maggie |date=20 January 2009 |title=Examining the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change |journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos]] |doi=10.1029/2009EO030002 |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=22–23|bibcode=2009EOSTr..90...22D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|author=John Cook et al|title=Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=April 2016|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002|volume=11|issue=4|bibcode=2016ERL....11d8002C}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence this list represents a minority viewpoint.

The [[scientific consensus]] is that the global average surface temperature has risen over the last century. [[Scientific opinion on climate change]] was summarized in the 2001 [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report]] of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The main conclusions on global warming at that time were as follows:
# The global [[Instrumental temperature record|average surface temperature]] has risen &lt;!-- The following is an approximate 95% confidence interval, please DO NOT replace by 0.4-0.8 --&gt;0.6 ± 0.2&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] since the late 19th century, and 0.17&amp;nbsp;°C per decade in the years 1971–2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/005.htm Climate Change 2001:]
Working Group I: The Scientific Basis p.5 – IPCC&lt;/ref&gt;
# "There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is [[Attribution of recent climate change|attributable to human activities]]", in particular emissions of the [[greenhouse gas]]es carbon dioxide and methane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/007.htm Climate Change 2001:]
Working Group I: The Scientific Basis p.7 – IPCC&lt;/ref&gt;
# If greenhouse gas emissions continue the warming will also continue, with temperatures projected to increase by 1.4&amp;nbsp;°C to 5.8&amp;nbsp;°C between 1990 and 2100.{{Cref2|A}} Accompanying this temperature increase will be increases in some types of extreme weather and a projected [[sea level rise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/008.htm Climate Change 2001:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231162245/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/008.htm |date=December 31, 2007 }} Working Group I: The Scientific Basis p.8 – IPCC&lt;/ref&gt; The balance of impacts of global warming become significantly negative at larger values of warming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/pdf/wg2TARchap19.pdf Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability p.958 – IPCC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623232331/http://grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/pdf/wg2TARchap19.pdf |date=June 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several efforts to compile lists of dissenting scientists, including a 2008 US senate minority report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.Blogs&amp;ContentRecord_id=2674e64f-802a-23ad-490b-bd9faf4dcdb7 | title=U.

For the purpose of this list, a "scientist" is defined as an individual who has published at least one peer-reviewed research article in the broad field of natural sciences, although not necessarily in a field relevant to climatology. Since the publication of the IPCC Third Assessment Report, each has made a clear statement in his or her own words (as opposed to the name being found on a petition, etc.) disagreeing with one or more of the report's three main conclusions, and each has been described in reliable sources as a climate skeptic, denier, or in disagreement with any of the three main conclusions. Their views on climate change are usually described in more detail in their biographical articles.  Few of the statements in the references for this list are part of the [[peer-reviewed]] scientific literature; most are from other sources such as interviews, opinion pieces, online essays and presentations.

''[[Nota bene]]'': Only individuals who have their own Wikipedia article may be included in the list.

==Scientists questioning the accuracy of IPCC climate projections==
These scientists have said that it is not possible to project global climate accurately enough to justify the ranges projected for temperature and sea-level rise over the 21st century. They may not conclude specifically that the current IPCC projections are either too high or too low, but that the projections are likely to be inaccurate due to inadequacies of current global climate modeling.

The '''mediocrity principle''' is the [[philosophical]] notion that "if an item is drawn at random from one of several sets or categories, it's likelier to come from the most numerous category than from any one of the less numerous categories".&lt;ref name="Kukla2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Kukla |year=2009 |title=Extraterrestrials: A Philosophical Perspective |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739142455 |lccn=2009032272 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkdqTFVNwmgC&amp;pg=PA20 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been taken to suggest that there is nothing very unusual about the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|evolution of the Solar System]], [[Earth's history]], the [[evolution of biological complexity]], [[human evolution]], or any one [[nation]]. It is a [[heuristic]] in the vein of the [[Copernican principle]], and is sometimes used as a philosophical statement about the place of humanity. The idea is to assume mediocrity, rather than starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is special, privileged, exceptional, or even [[supremacism|superior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1377474/principle-of-mediocrity|title=principle of mediocrity - astrobiology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MediocrePZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_12.html#myerspz|title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2011 — Page 12|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial life==
[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|thumb|200px|Life is ubiquitous on Earth, but does it exist elsewhere?]]

The mediocrity principle suggests, given the existence of life on Earth, that [[life]] typically exists on [[Earth analog|Earth-like planet]]s throughout the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, Eric, and Steve McMillan. ''Astronomy: A Beginner’s Guide to the Universe.'' Ed. Nancy Whilton. San Francisco: Pearson, 2010.{{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other approaches==

The mediocrity principle is in contrast with the [[anthropic principle]], which asserts that the presence of an intelligent observer (humans) limits the circumstances to bounds under which intelligent life can be [[Observation bias|observed to exist]], no matter [[Rare Earth hypothesis|how improbable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; Both stand in contrast to the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning hypothesis]], which asserts that the natural conditions for intelligent life are implausibly rare.

The mediocrity principle implies that Earth-like environments are necessarily common, based in part on the evidence of [[Doomsday argument|any happening at all]], whereas the anthropic principle suggests that no assertion can be made about the probability of intelligent life based on a sample set of one ([[Dunning–Kruger effect|self-described]]) example, who are necessarily capable of making such an assertion about themselves.

It is also possible to handle the Mediocrity Principle as a statistical problem, a case of a single [[Data point]] statistics, also present in the [[German tank problem]].

==Other uses==
[[David Deutsch]] argues that the mediocrity principle is incorrect from a physical point of view, in reference to either humanity's part of the universe or to its species. Deutsch refers to [[Stephen Hawking]]'s quote: "The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies". Deutsch wrote that Earth's neighborhood in the universe is not typical (80% of the universe's matter is [[dark matter]]) and that a concentration of mass such as the Solar System is an "isolated, uncommon phenomenon". He also disagrees with [[Richard Dawkins]], who considers that humans, because of natural evolution, are limited to the capabilities of their species. Deutsch responds that even though evolution did not give humans the ability to detect [[neutrino]]s, scientists can currently detect them, which significantly expands their capabilities beyond what is available as a result of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=[[David Deutsch]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

'''Micronized rubber powder''' (MRP) is classified as fine, dry, powdered elastomeric [[crumb rubber]] in which a significant proportion of particles are less than 100&amp;nbsp;µm and free of foreign particulates (metal, fiber, etc.). MRP particle size distributions typically range from 180&amp;nbsp;µm to 10&amp;nbsp;µm. Narrower distributions can be achieved depending on the classification technology.

==MRP source materials==

MRP is typically made from vulcanized elastomeric material, most often from end-of-life tire material, but can also be produced from post-industrial [[nitrile]] rubber, [[ethylene propylene diene monomer|ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)]], [[butyl]] and natural rubber compounds.

==Characteristics==

MRP is a free flowing, black rubber powder that disperses into a multitude of systems and applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayyer|first=Ravi|title=Evaluation of micronized rubber powders with cost/performance benefits|url=http://digital.ipcprintservices.com/display_article.php?id=956952|publisher=Rubber World|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its micron size, MRP can be incorporated into multiple polymers, and provides a smooth surface appearance on finished products.  In some cases, in order to improve compatibility with host materials, the MRP is given a chemical treatment to activate, or “make functional” the surface of the powder particles.  This is referred to as functionalized MRP or FMRP.

MRP represents an evolution over previous post-manufactured rubber technologies. The most basic rubber processing technology converts end-of-life tire and post-industrial rubber material into rubber chips that are typically one inch or larger in size. These chips are then used in tire-derived fuel and civil engineering projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA: Tire-Derived Fuel |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/tdf.htm |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=28 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326030623/http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/tdf.htm |archivedate=26 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second-generation processing technology converts end-of-life tire and rubber material into [[crumb rubber]], also known as ground tire rubber (GTR). GTR typically comprises chips between one inch and 30 mesh in size, with the associated fiber and steel mostly removed. This material is used in asphalt, as garden mulch and in playgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA: Ground Rubber Applications |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/ground.htm |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=29 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220052729/http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/ground.htm |archivedate=20 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MRP is a micron-size material that is produced in various sizes, including 80 mesh and down to 300 mesh. MRP is virtually metal and fiber-free, enabling its use in a wide range of advanced products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Welch|first=Mary|title=Rubber Powder Supplier Gains Traction With Global Sales, Green Solution|url=http://www.globalatlanta.com/article/26726/rubber-powder-supplier-gains-traction-with-global-sales-green-solution/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Global Atlanta|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MRP is used as a compound extender to offset the use of natural rubber and synthetic polymers as well as act as a process aid in material production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jin Kuk|title=Study on powder utilization of waste tires as a filler in rubber compounding|journal=[[Rubber Chemistry and Technology]]|date=Nov–Dec 1998|volume=71|issue=5|pages=1028|doi=10.5254/1.3538508|last2=Burford|first2=R. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, MRP can reduce formulation costs, because it replaces commodity-priced rubber- and oil-based feedstocks, According to some estimates, MRP offers up to 50 percent cost savings over virgin raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why use Micronized Rubber Powder|url=http://www.lehightechnologies.com/index.php/what_we_do/why_use_micronized_rubber/|publisher=Lehigh Technologies|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

MRP also can improve the sustainability, and in some cases the performance, of the compounds in which it is used.  For example, the smaller particle sizes of MRP are known to increase the impact strength of certain plastic compositions.  However, in all applications the particle size and loading levels depend on the target application.

Due to its size and composition, MRP can be incorporated into more advanced and higher-value applications than [[crumb rubber]]. Industries incorporating MRP into their products include tire, automotive, construction, industrial components and consumer products.  It is also used as an additive in tires, plastics, asphalt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Guangyu |author2=Song, Yingdeng |author3=Xiolin, Li |author4=Zhang, Liqun|title=Noise-reducing performance of rubber powder modified asphalt pavement materials|journal=China Synthetic Rubber Industry|year=2011|volume=34|issue=4|pages=314–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; coatings, and sealants.  MRP can also be incorporated into prime or recycled grade [[Polypropylene|polypropylene (PP)]], [[high-density polyethylene|high-density polyethylene (HDPE)]] and [[nylon]]s. Additionally, the incorporation of MRPs in [[thermoplastic elastomers|thermoplastic elastomers (TPE)]] and [[thermoplastic]] [[vulcanizate]]s (TPV) makes it a feasible ingredient for automotive and building and construction applications.

Currently, the leading producer of MRP is [[Lehigh Technologies]], which utilizes a cryogenic turbo mill process with more than 100 million pounds of annual production capacity. MRP produced by Lehigh has set high benchmarks for performance in a range of applications with customers and third-party research institutions, including several studies on increased asphalt performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willis|first=J.

{{Portal|Geology|Paleontology|Time}}

The '''Middle Jurassic''' is the second [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] of the [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]. It lasted from about 174 to 163 [[million years ago]]. 
Fossil-bearing rocks from the Middle Jurassic are relatively rare,{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} but some important formations include the [[Forest Marble Formation]] in England, the [[Kilmaluag Formation]] in Scotland,&lt;ref name="BGS"&gt;British Geological Survey. 2011. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265611781_Stratigraphical_framework_for_the_Middle_Jurassic_strata_of_Great_Britain_and_the_adjoining_continental_shelf Stratigraphic framework for the Middle Jurassic strata of Great Britain and the adjoining continental shelf: research report RR/11/06]. British Geological Survey, Keyworth, Nottingham. &lt;/ref&gt; the [[Daohugou Beds]] in China, [[Itat Formation]] in Russia, and the [[Isalo III Formation]] of western Madagascar.

==Paleogeography==
[[File:MiddleJurassicMap.jpg|left|thumb|Map of the Middle Jurassic]]
During the Middle Jurassic epoch, [[Pangaea]] began to separate into [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]], and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] formed. Tectonic activities are active on eastern Laurasia as the [[Cimmerian plate]] continues to collide with Laurasia's southern coast, completely closing the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]]. A [[subduction zone]] on the coast of western North America continues to create the [[Geology of the Rocky Mountains#Ancestral rock|Ancestral Rocky Mountains]].

==Middle Jurassic fauna==
The Middle Jurassic is one of the key periods in the evolution of life on earth. Many groups, including dinosaurs and mammals, diversified during this time.&lt;ref name="Benson2014"&gt;Benson RBJ, Campione NE, Carrano MT, Mannion PD, Sullivan C, Upchurch P, and Evans DC. 2014. [http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001853 Rates of dinosaur body mass evolution indicate 170 million years of sustained ecological innovation on the avian stem lineage]. PLoS Biology 12, no. 5: e1001853.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Close2016"&gt; Close RA, Friedman M, Lloyd GT, and Benson RB. 2015.

===Marine life===
During this time, [[marine life]] (including [[ammonite]]s and [[bivalve]]s) flourished. [[Ichthyosaur]]s, although common, are reduced in diversity; while the top marine predators, the [[pliosaur]]s, grew to the size of [[orca|killer whale]]s and larger (e.g. ''[[Pliosaurus]]'', ''[[Liopleurodon]]''). [[Plesiosaur]]s became common at this time, and [[metriorhynchid]] [[crocodilia]]ns first appeared.

===Terrestrial life===
Many of the major groups of [[dinosaur]]s emerged during the Middle Jurassic, (including [[Cetiosaurus|cetiosaurs]], [[Brachiosauridae|brachiosaurs]], [[Megalosauridae|megalosaurs]] and primitive [[ornithopod]]s).&lt;ref name="Benson2014"/&gt;

Descendants of the [[therapsid]]s, the [[cynodont]]s were still flourishing along with the dinosaurs. These included the [[tritylodonts]] and mammals. Mammals remained quite small, but were diverse and numerous in faunas from around the world.&lt;ref name="MammalBible"&gt;Kielan-Jaworowska, Z., Cifelli, R.L., and Luo, Z.-X. 2004. Mammals from the age of dinosaurs: origins evolution and structure. 630 pp. Columbia University Press, New York. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Panciroli, E. 2017. [https://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2017/fossil-focus-first-mammals/ The First Mammals] Palaeontology Online. &lt;/ref&gt; Tritylodonts were larger, and also had an almost global distribution.&lt;ref name="Kemp2005"&gt; Kemp, T 2005. [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Origin-Evolution-Mammals-Oxford-Biology/dp/0198507615 The Origin and Evolution of Mammals]. Oxford University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; The first crown group mammals appeared in the Middle Jurassic. A group of cynodonts, the [[trithelodont]]s, were becoming rare and eventually became extinct at the end of this epoch.

===Flora===
[[Conifer]]s were dominant in the Middle Jurassic. Other plants, such as [[ginkgo]]es, [[cycad]]s, and [[fern]]s were also common.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite emission reductions from automobiles and more fuel-efficient (and therefore less polluting) [[turbofan]] and [[turboprop]] engines, the rapid growth of [[air travel]] in recent years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to [[aviation]]. In the [[European Union|EU]], [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from aviation increased by 87% between 1990 and 2006.&lt;ref name = ETS&gt;{{cite press release | title = Climate change: Commission proposes bringing air transport into EU Emissions Trading Scheme | publisher = EU press release | date = 2006-12-20 | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/1862 | accessdate = 2010-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present aviation accounts for 2.5% of global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer A.W., Evans A.D., Reynolds T.G., Dray L. (2016). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2865 Costs of mitigating CO2 emissions from passenger aircraft]. Nature Clim. Change. 6:4:pp.412-417.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to projected growth in air travel, in the most technologically radical scenarios for having a better than 50% chance of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, in 2050 aviation will make up 15% of global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. In more conventional scenarios its emissions will exceed the entire global carbon budget before then.&lt;ref&gt;Bows A. (2010). [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=10106917&amp;fileId=S000192400000395X Aviation and climate change: confronting the challenge.] Aeronautical Journal. 114:1158:pp.459-468.&lt;/ref&gt; This presents governments and the operators of aircraft with a responsibility to reduce the aviation industry's emissions.

== Methods of mitigating aviation's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions ==

Mitigation of aviation's environmental impact can be achieved through a variety of measures, the most obvious and arguably the most economical of which is to reduce the fuel burn of the aircraft as this accounts for 28% of an [[airlines]] costs. However, there is a wide variety of other options available to minimise aviation's growing impact upon the environment as are listed below:&lt;ref name = NYT&gt;{{citation | title = New York Times - Aviation and global warming | publisher = New York Times| date = 2007-09-20 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/opinion/20iht-edbisi.1.7583290.html | accessdate = 2010-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aircraft efficiency ===
[[File:Boeing 787 Roll-out.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]] promises to provide 20% lower fuel burn than current-generation aircraft.]]

As stated previously, reducing the direct fuel burn of an aircraft is the most obvious and arguably the most economical way of reducing emissions attributable to aviation. Over the last 40 years, commercial jet [[airliners]] have become 70% more fuel efficient and are predicted to be another 25% more fuel efficient by 2025.&lt;ref name = NYT/&gt;

The next-generation of aircraft, including the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]], [[Airbus A350]] and [[Bombardier CSeries]], are 20% more fuel efficient per passenger kilometre than current generation aircraft. This is primarily achieved through more fuel-efficient engines and lighter airframes &amp; supporting structures made of [[composite materials]] but is also achieved through more [[aerodynamic]] shapes, [[winglets]], a "one-piece" fuselage and more advanced computer systems for optimising routes and loading of the aircraft.
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Boeing 787 Technology| publisher = Boeing | url = http://www.boeing.com/commercial/787family/background.html | accessdate = 2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Route optimization ===

Currently, air traffic corridors that aircraft are forced to follow place unnecessary detours on an aircraft's route forcing higher fuel burn and an increase in emissions. An improved [[Air Traffic Management]] System with more direct routes and optimized cruising altitudes would allow airlines to reduce their emissions by up to 18%.&lt;ref name = NYT/&gt;

In the [[European Union]], a [[Single European Sky]] has been proposed for the last 15 years so that there are no overlapping airspace restrictions between countries in the EU and so reduce emissions. As yet, the Single European Sky is still only a plan but progress has been made. If the Single European Sky had been created 15 years ago, 12 million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could have been saved.&lt;ref name = NYT/&gt;

=== Biofuels ===
[[File:BA B747-436 G-CIVF LHR.jpg|thumb|[[British Airways]] will be using half a million tonnes of waste annually to create biofuels for commercial use from 2014 onwards.]]

Biofuels are fuels derived from [[biomass]] material such as plants and waste. Plant derived biofuels offer large savings in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions as they absorb [[Carbon Dioxide]] and release it as [[Oxygen]] when they grow and so in a life-cycle, emissions can be drastically reduced. A number of airlines have operated biofuel test flights including [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]], which flew with one engine operating on a blend of 20% coconut oil and 80% traditional jet fuel, and [[Continental Airlines]] which flew with one engine operating on a blend of 44% [[Jatropha]] oil, 6% [[Algae]] oil and 50% traditional [[jet fuel]]. Other airlines to demonstrate biofuels include [[Air New Zealand]] and [[Japan Airlines]].&lt;ref name = AW/&gt;
 
In the Continental Airlines test, the engine running partly on biofuel burned 46&amp;nbsp;kg less fuel than the conventionally fuelled engine in 1 and a half hours while producing more thrust from the same volume of fuel. Continental Airlines' CEO, Larry Kellner, commented "This is a good step forward, an opportunity to really make a difference to the environment" citing jatropha's 50–80% lower CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions as opposed to Jet-A1 in its lifecycle.&lt;ref name = AW&gt;"A Greener Future?" - ''Aircraft Illustrated'', March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014 onwards, [[British Airways]], in co-operation with [[Solena]], is going to turn half a million tonnes of waste annually that would normally go to [[landfill]] from the [[City of London]] into biofuel to be used in the British Airways fleet. Waste derived biofuel produces up to 95% less pollution in its life-cycle and so therefore this measure will reduce emissions by the equivalent of taking 42,000 cars off the road every year. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Solena Video on British Airways biofuel usage| publisher = Solena | url = http://www.cleanskies.com/videos/british-airways-solena-work-develop-europes-first-sustainable-jet-fuel-plant | accessdate = 2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improved operating procedures ===
[[File:Sas.b737.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scandinavian Airlines]] is operating their [[Boeing 737|737]] aircraft at slower cruising speeds to reduce emissions by 7–8%.]]

Airlines and airports are looking at ways of reducing emissions and fuel burn through the use of improved operating procedures. Two of the more common ones in operation are a single-engine taxi to and from the runway and the use of a [[Continuous Descent Approach]], or CDA, which can reduce emissions significantly during the operations in and around an airport.&lt;ref name = CDA&gt;{{citation | title = CDA Information| publisher = [[Civil Aviation Authority]] (UK) | url = http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/68/Basic_Principles_CDA.pdf | accessdate = 2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scandinavian Airlines]] (SAS) is now operating its [[Boeing 737]] fleet at a slower cruising speed to help reduce emissions by 7–8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = SAS reduces cruising speed to reduce emissions| publisher = Allianz | url = http://knowledge.allianz.com/en/globalissues/energy_co2/climate_solutions/aviation_emissions_reduction.html| accessdate = 2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emission Trading Scheme ===

In the [[European Union|EU]], aviation will be including the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|European Emission Trading Scheme]] from 2012 onwards. The scheme places a cap on the emissions an aircraft operator can emit and forces the operator to either lower emissions through more efficient technology or to buy "Carbon Credits" from other companies who have produced fewer emissions than their cap. It is thought that this will reduce aviation's net environmental impact.&lt;ref name = ETS/&gt;

== Methods of mitigating aviation's non-CO &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions ==

Aviation produces a number of other pollutants besides carbon dioxide including [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]], [[unburned hydrocarbon]]s (UHC) and [[contrail]]s. A number of methods to reduce the level of these pollutants follows:

=== Nitrogen oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;) ===

Nitrogen oxides have a far stronger impact upon climate change than Carbon Oxides and are produced in small quantities from aircraft engines. Engine designers have worked since the start of the [[jet age]] to reduce NO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and the result is ever reducing levels of nitrogen oxide emissions. For example, between 1997 and 2003, NO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from jet engines fell by over 40%.&lt;ref name = RR&gt;Rolls-Royce - The Jet Engine - {{ISBN|0 902121 2 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Particulates ===

Particulates and smoke were a problem with early jet engines at high power settings but modern engines are designed so that no smoke is produced at any point in the flight.&lt;ref name = RR/&gt;

=== Unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) ===
[[File:CointailstoMelbourne.JPG|thumb|Contrails formed by high altitude aircraft.]]

Unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) are products of [[incomplete combustion]] of fuel and are produced in greater quantities in engines with low pressure gains in the compressors and/or relatively low temperatures in the combustor. As with particulates, UHC has all but been eliminated in modern jet engines through improved design and technology.&lt;ref name = RR/&gt;

=== Contrails ===

Aircraft flying at high altitude form [[condensation trails]] or contrails in the exhaust plume of their engines. While in the [[Troposphere]] these have very little climatic impact. However, jet aircraft cruising in the [[Stratosphere]] do create an impact from their contrails, although the extent of the damage to the environment is as yet unknown. Contrails can also trigger the formation of high-altitude [[Cirrus cloud]] thus creating a greater climatic effect.&lt;ref name = RR/&gt; A 2015 study found that artificial cloudiness caused by contrail "outbreaks" reduce the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures. The former are decreased and the latter are increased, in comparison to temperatures the day before and the day after such outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhardt, J. &amp; Carleton, A.M. (2015). The impacts of long-lived jet contrail ‘outbreaks’ on surface station diurnal temperature range. Jrnl of Int'l Climatology. Online-early (July).&lt;/ref&gt; On days with outbreaks the day/night temperature difference was diminished by about 6F° in the U.S. South and 5F° in the Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150618122236.htm Jet contrails affect surface temperatures]. Science Daily. June 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the three days following the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], when no commercial aircraft flew in the United States, climate scientists measured the [[diurnal temperature range|daily temperature range]] over 5000 weather stations across the USA. The results showed a 1 ° Celsius change in the average daily temperature range for those days of the year, thus showing contrails do have a significant impact on climate.&lt;ref name=contrails/&gt; Potential ways of reducing the impact of contrails on our climate include reducing the maximum cruising altitude of aircraft so high-altitude contrails can not form. Cruising at lower altitudes would marginally increase flight time and increase fuel consumption by 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Williams | first = Victoria |author2=Robert B.

== Methods of mitigating aviation's noise emissions ==
{{main|Aircraft noise}}
[[File:Boeing 787 engine detail.jpg|thumb|left|Serrated edges of the [[nacelle]] on the [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] [[Trent 1000]] fitted to the new [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]] "Dreamliner".]]

One of the by-products of an aircraft's engine is noise and this has become an increasingly important issue which is being dealt with through many different methods:

=== Engines ===

Next-Generation engines are not only more fuel-efficient but also tend to be quieter with [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]]'s PurePower PW1000G fitted to the [[Bombardier CSeries]] aircraft being 4 times quieter than aircraft currently in service.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Bombardier CSeries Statistics | publisher = Bombardier| url = http://www.bombardier.com/en/aerospace/products/commercial-aircraft/cseries?docID=0901260d800091e6 | accessdate = 2010-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Engines can also incorporate serrated edges or [[chevron (aerospace)|'chevrons']] on the back of the [[nacelle]] to reduce noise impact as shown in this picture.&lt;ref name = RR/&gt;

=== Improved operating procedures ===

A [[Continuous Descent Approach]], or CDA, not only reduces fuel burn but also allows airlines to provide quieter approaches for part of the descent to a runway. As the engines are at close to idle power, less noise emissions are produced and combined with new engine technology, the reductions in noise emissions can be large.&lt;ref name = CDA/&gt;

== Carbon offset ==
[[File:Windmill D1 (Thornton Bank).jpg|thumb|Money generated by carbon offsets from airlines often go to fund green-energy projects such as [[Wind turbine|wind farms]].]]

A [[carbon offset]] is a means of reducing emissions to zero{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} by saving enough carbon to balance the carbon emitted by a particular action. Several airlines have begun offering carbon offsets to passengers to offset the emissions created by their proportion of the flight. Money generated is put to projects around the world to invest in [[green technology]] such as renewable energy and research into future technology. Airlines offering carbon offsets include [[British Airways]], [[easyJet]], [[Continental Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Lufthansa]] and [[Qantas]] although there are many more carriers participating in such schemes.&lt;ref name = BA&gt;{{citation | title = British Airways Carbon Offset Programme| publisher = British Airways | url = http://www.britishairways.com/travel/csr-your-footprint/public/en_gb | accessdate = 2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = easyJet Carbon Offset Programme| publisher = easyJet | url = http://www.easyjet.com/EN/Environment/index.shtml | accessdate = 2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Continental Airlines Carbon Offset Programme| publisher = Continental Airlines | url = http://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/company/globalcitizenship/offset.aspx | accessdate = 2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = BBW&gt;{{citation | title = Continental Airlines Carbon Offset Schemes| publisher = Bloomberg| url = http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2008/db20080321_437700.htm | accessdate = 2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British Airways' scheme ===

British Airways' carbon offsetting scheme involves paying a fee dependant on aircraft type, class of travel and distance flown and therefore prices vary. Funds generated are currently awarded to three renewable energy projects around the world: Bayin'aobao wind farm in [[Inner Mongolia]], Faxinal dos Guedes hydroelectric power plant in [[Brazil]] and Xiaohe hydroelctric power plant in [[Gansu Province]], China.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=British Airways Carbon Offset Schemes |publisher=British Airways |url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/csr-projects/public/en_gb |accessdate=2010-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225021844/http://www.britishairways.com/travel/csr-projects/public/en_gb |archivedate=December 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continental Airlines' scheme ===

Continental Airlines' carbon offsetting scheme involves paying a fixed fee of $2 to cancel out emissions through reforestation. Passengers can also choose to pay $50 for offsetting emissions through renewable energy projects.&lt;ref name = BBW/&gt;

[[File:MSN vials.JPG|thumb|150px|Vials of [[mesoporous silica]]]]
A '''molecular sieve''' is a material with pores (very small holes) of uniform size. These pore diameters are similar in size to small molecules, and thus large molecules cannot enter or be adsorbed, while smaller molecules can. As a mixture of molecules migrate through the stationary bed of porous, semi-solid substance referred to as a sieve (or matrix), the components of highest molecular weight (which are unable to pass into the molecular pores) leave the bed first, followed by successively smaller molecules. Some molecular sieves are used in [[chromatography]], a separation technique that sorts molecules based on their size. Other molecular sieves are used as [[desiccant]]s (some examples include [[activated charcoal]] and [[silica gel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistryglossary/g/Molecular-Sieve-Definition.htm |title=Molecular Sieve Definition - Definition of Molecular Sieve - What Is a Molecular Sieve? |publisher=Chemistry.about.com |date=2013-12-18 |accessdate=2014-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221222647/http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistryglossary/g/Molecular-Sieve-Definition.htm |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diameter of a molecular sieve is measured in [[Angstroms|ångströms]] (Å) or [[nanometres]] (nm). According to [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] notation, [[microporous material]]s have pore diameters of less than 2&amp;nbsp;nm (20 Å) and [[Macropore|macroporous materials]] have pore diameters of greater than 50&amp;nbsp;nm (500 Å); the [[mesoporous material|mesoporous]] category thus lies in the middle with pore diameters between 2 and 50&amp;nbsp;nm (20–500 Å).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. Rouquerol |display-authors=etal |title=Recommendations for the characterization of porous solids (Technical Report)|journal=Pure Appl.

==Materials==
Molecular sieves can be [[microporous material|microporous]], [[mesoporous material|mesoporous]], or [[macroporous material]].

===Microporous material (&lt;2 nm)===
* [[Zeolites]] ([[aluminosilicate]] [[minerals]], not to be confused with [[aluminium silicate]])

==Applications==
Molecular sieves are often utilized in the [[petroleum]] industry, especially for drying gas streams.   For example, in the liquid natural gas (LNG) industry, the water content of the gas needs to be reduced to less than 1 [[Parts-per notation|ppmv]] to prevent blockages caused by ice.

In the laboratory, molecular sieves are used to dry solvent. "Sieves" have proven to be superior to traditional drying techniques, which often employ aggressive [[desiccant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, D. B. G., Lawton, M., "Drying of Organic Solvents: Quantitative Evaluation of the Efficiency of Several Desiccants", The Journal of Organic Chemistry 2010, vol. 75, 8351. {{DOI| 10.1021/jo101589h}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the term zeolites, molecular sieves are used for a wide range of catalytic applications.  They catalyze [[isomerisation]], [[alkylation]], and [[epoxidation]], and are used in large scale industrial processes, including [[hydrocracking]] and fluid catalytic [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pujadó|first=P. R.|last2=Rabó|first2=J. A.|last3=Antos|first3=G. J.|last4=Gembicki|first4=S. A.|date=1992-03-11|title=Industrial catalytic applications of molecular sieves|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092058619280191O|journal=Catalysis Today|volume=13|issue=1|pages=113–141|doi=10.1016/0920-5861(92)80191-O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also used in the filtration of air supplies for breathing apparatus, for example those used by [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]] and [[firefighters]]. In such applications, air is supplied by an [[air compressor]] and is passed through a cartridge filter which, depending on the application, is filled with molecular sieve and/or [[activated carbon]], finally being used to charge breathing air tanks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawrence-factor.com/direc_filters.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416011750/http://www.lawrence-factor.com/direc_filters.html|date=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Such filtration can remove particulates and compressor exhaust products from the breathing air supply.

===FDA approval===
The U.S. FDA has as of April 1, 2012 approved [[sodium aluminosilicate]] for direct contact with consumable items under 21 CFR 182.2727.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sec. 182.2727 Sodium aluminosilicate|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=182.2727|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this approval Europe had used molecular sieves with pharmaceuticals and independent testing suggested that molecular sieves meet all government requirements but the industry had been unwilling to fund the expensive testing required for government approval.&lt;ref name="desiccantpacks.net/molecular-sieve/"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desiccantpacks.net/molecular-sieve/ |title=Molecular Sieve Desiccant |publisher=DesiccantPacks.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regeneration==
Methods for regeneration of molecular sieves include pressure change (as in oxygen concentrators), heating and purging with a carrier gas (as when used in [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] dehydration), or heating under high vacuum. Regeneration temperatures range from 175&amp;nbsp;°C to 315&amp;nbsp;°C depending on molecular sieve type.&lt;ref name="sig"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/chemistry/chemical-synthesis/learning-center/technical-bulletins/al-1430/molecular-sieves.html |title=Molecular Sieves |publisher=[[Sigma-Aldrich]] |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Silica gel#Regeneration|silica gel can be regenerated]] by heating it in a regular oven to 120&amp;nbsp;°C (250&amp;nbsp;°F) for two hours. However, some types of silica gel will "pop" when exposed to enough water. This is caused by breakage of the silica spheres when contacting the water.&lt;ref&gt;Spence Konde, [http://m.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-042607-140508/unrestricted/MQP-RWT-606.pdf "Preparation of High-Silica Zeolite Beads From Silica Gel,"] retrieved 2011-09-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==3Å==
* Approximate chemical formula: 2/3K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O•1/3Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O•Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;• 2 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; • 9/2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

3Å molecular sieves do not adsorb molecules whose diameters are larger than 3 Å. The characteristics of these molecular sieves include fast adsorption speed, frequent regeneration ability, good crushing resistance and [[pollution resistance]]. These features can improve both the efficiency and lifetime of the sieve. 3Å molecular sieves are the necessary desiccant in petroleum and chemical industries for refining oil, polymerization, and chemical gas-liquid depth drying.

3Å molecular sieves are used to dry a range of materials, such as [[ethanol]], air, [[refrigerant]]s, [[natural gas]] and [[unsaturated hydrocarbons]]. The latter include cracking gas, [[acetylene]], [[ethylene]], [[propylene]] and [[butadiene]].

3Å molecular sieve is utilized to remove water from ethanol, which can later be used directly as a bio-fuel or indirectly to produce various products such as chemicals, foods, pharmaceuticals, and more. Since normal distillation cannot remove all the water (an undesirable byproduct from ethanol production) from ethanol process streams due to the formation of an [[azeotrope]] at around 95 percent concentration, molecular sieve beads are used to separate ethanol and water on a molecular level by adsorbing the water into the beads and allowing the ethanol to pass freely. Once the beads are full of water, temperature or pressure can be manipulated, allowing the water to be released from the molecular sieve beads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hengye Inc|url=http://www.hengyeinc.com|website=Hengye Inc.|publisher=Hengye Inc.|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3Å molecular sieves are stored at room temperature, with a relative humidity not more than 90%. They are sealed under reduced pressure, being kept away from water, acids and alkalis.

==4Å==
* Chemical formula: Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O•Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;•2SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;•9/2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
* Silica-alumina ratio: SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;≈2

4Å molecular sieves are widely used to dry laboratory solvents.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, D. B. G.; Lawton, M., "Drying of Organic Solvents: Quantitative Evaluation of the Efficiency of Several Desiccants", The Journal of Organic Chemistry 2010, 75, 8351-8354. {{DOI|10.1021/jo101589h}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They can absorb water and other molecules with a critical diameter less than 4 Å such as NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It is widely used in the drying, refining and purification of liquids and gases (such as the preparation of argon).

[[File:4A sieves.JPG|thumb|150px|Bottle of 4Å molecular sieves.]]

===Polyester agent additives===
These molecular sieves are used to assist detergents as they can produce demineralized water through [[calcium]] ion exchange, remove and prevent the deposition of dirt. They are widely used to replace [[phosphorus]]. The 4Å molecular sieve plays a major role to replace sodium tripolyphosphate as detergent auxiliary in order to mitigate the environmental impact of the detergent. It also can be used as a [[soap]] forming agent and in [[toothpaste]].

===Harmful waste treatment===
4Å molecular sieves can purify sewage of cationic species such as [[ammonium]] ions, Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Due to the high selectivity for NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; they have been successfully applied in the field to combat [[eutrophication]] and other effects in waterways due to excessive ammonium ions. 4Å molecular sieves have also been used to remove heavy metal ions present in water due to industrial activities.

===Other purposes===
# The [[metallurgical industry]] - separating agent, separation, extraction of brine potassium, [[rubidium]], [[caesium]], etc. 
# Petrochemical industry, [[catalyst]], [[desiccant]], adsorbent 
# Agriculture - [[soil conditioner]];
# Medicine - load silver [[zeolite]] antibacterial agent.

==5Å==
* Chemical formula: 0.7CaO•0.30Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O•Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;•2.0SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; •4.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
* Silica-alumina ratio: SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;≈2
5Å molecular sieves are often utilized in the [[petroleum]] industry, especially for the purification of gas streams and in the chemistry laboratory for separating [[chemical compound|compounds]] and drying reaction starting materials. They contain tiny pores of a precise and uniform size, and are mainly used as an adsorbent for gases and liquids.

5Å molecular sieves are used to dry [[natural gas]], along with performing [[desulfurization]] and [[decarbonation]] of the gas.
They can also be used to separate mixtures of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen, and oil-wax n-hydrocarbons from branched and polycyclic hydrocarbons.

5Å molecular sieves are stored at room temperature, with a [[relative humidity]] less than 90% in cardboard barrels or carton packaging. The molecular sieves should not be directly exposed to the air and water, acids and alkalis should be avoided.

'''Selecting Molecular Sieve:'''

Molecular Sieves are available in different shape and sizes. But the spherical beads have advantage over other shape as they offer lower pressure drop, attrition resistant as they do not have any sharp edges, also have good strength i.e. crush force required per unit area is higher. Certain beaded molecular sieves offer lower heat capacity thus less energy requirement during regeneration.

The other advantage of using beaded molecular sieve is bulk density is usually higher than other shape, thus for same adsorption requirement molecular sieve volume required is less. Thus while doing de-bottlenecking you may use beaded molecular sieve and load more adsorbent in same volume and avoid any vessel modifications.

'''Myrmecophily''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɜːr|m|ə|ˈ|k|ɒ|f|ɪ|l|i}} {{respell|mur|mə|KOF|il|ee}}; literally ''"ant-love"'') is the term applied to positive interspecies [[Association (ecology)|associations]] between [[ant]]s and a variety of other organisms such as plants, other arthropods, and fungi. Myrmecophily refers to [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] associations with ants, though in its more general use the term may also refer to [[commensalism|commensal]] or even [[parasite|parasitic]] interactions.

The term ''myrmecophile'' is used mainly for animals that associate with ants. There are an estimated 10,000 species of ants (Formicidae), with a higher [[biodiversity|diversity]] in the tropics.&lt;ref name=holl&gt;B. Holldobler and E.O. Wilson, The Ants, Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In most terrestrial ecosystems ants are ecologically and numerically dominant, being the main invertebrate predators. As a result, ants play a key role in controlling arthropod richness, abundance, and community structure.&lt;ref name=fied&gt;K. Fiedler, B. Holldobler, and P. Seufert, "Butterflies and ants: The communicative domain," Cellular and molecular life sciences, vol. 52, 1996, pp. 14-24.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that the evolution of myrmecophilous interactions has contributed to the abundance and ecological success of ants,&lt;ref name=holl/&gt;&lt;ref name=eow&gt;B. Holldobler and E.O. Wilson, Journey to the Ants,  Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; by ensuring a dependable and energy-rich food supply and thus providing a competitive advantage for ants over other invertebrate predators.&lt;ref name=blu&gt;N.

Fiedler, "Bottom-up control and co-occurrence in complex communities: honeydew and nectar determine a rainforest ant mosaic," Oikos,  vol. 106, 2004, pp. 344-358.&lt;/ref&gt; Most myrmecophilous associations are opportunistic, unspecialized, and facultative (meaning both species are capable of surviving without the interaction), though obligate mutualisms (those in which one or both species are dependent on the interaction for survival) have also been observed for many species.&lt;ref name=sta&gt;B. Stadler and T. Dixon, Mutualism: Ants and their insect partners,  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myrmecophile==
A '''myrmecophile''' is an organism that lives in association with [[ant]]s.

Myrmecophiles may have various roles in their host ant colony. Many consume waste materials in the nests, such as dead ants, dead larvae, or [[fungus|fungi]] growing in the nest. Some myrmecophiles, however, feed on the stored food supplies of ants, and a few are predatory on ant eggs, larvae, or pupae. Others benefit the ants by providing a food source for them. Most associations are facultative, benefiting one or both participants but not being necessary to their survival, but many myrmecophilous relationships are obligate, meaning one or the other participant requires the relationship for survival.

Myrmecophilous associations are best known in butterflies of the family [[Lycaenidae]]. Many lycaenid caterpillars produce nectar by specialized organs and communicate with the ants through sound and vibrations.&lt;ref name="pierce"&gt;Pierce NE, Braby MF, Heath A, Lohman DJ, Mathew J, Rand DB, Travassos MA. 2002.

There are myrmecophilous beetles in the families [[Coccinellidae]] (e.g. the [[ladybird]] ''[[Thalassa saginata]]''), [[Aphodiinae|Aphodiidae]], [[Scarabaeidae]], [[Lucanidae]], [[Leiodidae|Cholevidae]], [[Pselaphidae]], [[Staphylinidae]], [[Histeridae]] and [[Ptiliidae]] (some treated here as subfamilies).

''Psyche'' (Cairo: Hindawi Pub. Co.) 2013: 1-14&lt;/ref&gt; Myrmecophilous associations are also seen in various other insects such as [[aphid]]s and [[treehopper]]s, as well as the [[hoverfly]] genus ''[[Microdon]]'' and several other groups of flies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=I.

The first major work in cataloguing [[United Kingdom|British]] myrmecophiles was done by [[Horace Donisthorpe]] in his 1927 book ''The Guests of British Ants''.

==Ant-plant interactions==
{{See also|Nectar}}
Ant-plant interactions are geographically widespread,&lt;ref name=vric&gt;V. Rico-Gray and P. Oliveira, The Ecology and Evolution of Ant-Plant Interactions,  Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; with hundreds of species of myrmecophytic plants in several families including the [[Leguminosae]], [[Euphorbiaceae]], and [[Orchidaceae]].&lt;ref name=eow/&gt; In general, myrmecophytes (or ant plants) usually provide some form of shelter and food in exchange for ant "tending," which may include protection, seed dispersal (see [[myrmecochory]]), reduced competition from other plants, hygienic services, and/or nutrient supplementation.&lt;ref name=holl/&gt;&lt;ref name=heil&gt;M. Heil and D. McKey, "Protective ant-plant interactions as model systems in ecological and evolutionary research," Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics,  vol. 34, 2003, pp. 425-453.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the most common and important structural adaptations of ant plants are [[Nectar (plant)#Extrafloral nectaries|extrafloral nectaries]], [[domatia]], and (least commonly) [[Beltian body|Beltian bodies]]. Plant domatia are pre-formed nesting sites provided by the plant in the form of hollow stems, petioles, thorns, or curled leaves.&lt;ref name=heil/&gt; The production of ant-specialized domatia has been documented in over 100 genera of tropical plants.&lt;ref name=heil/&gt; Beltian bodies provide a high-energy food source to ants in the form of nutritive corpuscles produced on leaflet tips,&lt;ref name=holl/&gt; and they have been described in at least 20 plant families.&lt;ref name=heil/&gt; Extrafloral nectaries (EFN's) are known to occur in at least 66 families of angiosperm plants in both temperate and tropical regions, as well as some ferns, but are absent in all gymnosperms and are most abundant in the tropics.&lt;ref name=heil/&gt; EFN's being outside of the plant flowers are not employed in pollination; their primary purpose is to attract and sustain tending ants. Many plants can control the flow of nectar from the EFN's so that the availability of nectar varies according to daily and seasonal cycles. Because ants can respond quickly to changes in flow rate from EFN's, this may be possible mechanism by which plants can induce greater ant activity during times of peak herbivory and minimize overall costs of nectar production.&lt;ref name=heil/&gt; The combined nutritional output of EFN's and Beltian bodies can be a significant food source for tending ants, and in some cases can provide the total nutritive needs for an ant colony.

In exchange for nesting sites and food resources, ants protect plants from [[herbivore]]s. One the best-known examples of ant-plant [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] is in bullhorn acacias (''[[Acacia cornigera]]'') and their tending ''[[Pseudomyrmex]]'' ants in Central America.&lt;ref name=eow/&gt;&lt;ref name=vric/&gt; This system was studied by Dan Janzen in the late 1960s, who provided some of the first experimental evidence that ants significantly reduce herbivory rates of myrmecophytes.&lt;ref name=Djan&gt;D. Janzen, "Coevolution of mutualism between ants and acacias in Central America," Evolution,  vol. 20, 1966, pp. 249-275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name=janz&gt;D. Janzen, "Interaction of the bull's-horn acacia (Acacia cornigera L. ) with an ant inhabitant (Pseudomyrmex ferruginea F. Smith) in Eastern Mexico," Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull. ,  vol. 47, 1967, pp. 315-558.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then many other studies have demonstrated similar results in other systems.&lt;ref name=eow/&gt;&lt;ref name=heil/&gt; In the Bullhorn acacia system, in exchange for protection the acacias provide domatia, Beltian bodies, and EFN's, and there is evidence that the ''Pseudomyrmex'' ants can survive exclusively on these food resources without having to forage elsewhere.&lt;ref name=holl/&gt; For many plants, including the bullhorn acacias, ants can significantly reduce herbivory from both phytophagous insects as well as larger organisms, such as large grazing mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanton, M. L. and T. M. Palmer|title=The high cost of mutualism: effects of four species of East African ant symbionts on their myrmecophyte host tree|journal=Ecology|date=2011|volume=92|pages=1073–1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obligately associated ant species are some of most aggressive ants in the world, and can defend a plant against herbivory by large mammals by repeatedly biting their attacker and spraying formic acid into the wound.&lt;ref name=eow/&gt;

Myrmecophily is considered a form of indirect plant defense against herbivory, though ants often provide other services in addition to protection. Some ants provide hygienic services to keep leaf surfaces clean and deter disease, and defense against fungal pathogens has also been demonstrated.&lt;ref name=heil/&gt; It is common for ants to prune epiphytes, vines, and parasitic plants from their host plant, and they sometimes thin the shoots of neighboring plants as well. In doing so, ants reduce plant-plant competition for space, light, nutrients, and water.&lt;ref name=holl/&gt; Finally, current work  focusing on ants' role in nutrient supplementation for plants has shown that in many ant-plant relationships nutrient flow is bidirectional. One study has estimated that while 80% of the carbon in the bodies of ''[[Azteca (genus)|Azteca]]'' spp. workers is supplied by the host tree (''[[Cecropia]]'' spp.),  90% of the ''Cecropia'' tree's nitrogen was supplied by ant debris carried to the tree as a result of external foraging.&lt;ref name=alv&gt;G.

Ulloa-Chacon, "Ant-plant Association in Two Tococa Species From a Primary Rain Forest of Colombian Choco (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)," Sociobiology,  vol. 38, 2001, pp. 558-602.&lt;/ref&gt; In light of these services, myrmecophily has been consdiered advantageous in ensuring a plant's survival and ecological success,&lt;ref name=heil/&gt; although the costs to the plant of providing for the ants can sufficiently high to offsets benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanton, M. L. and T. M. Palmer|title=The high cost of mutualism: effects of four species of East African ant symbionts on their myrmecophyte host tree|journal=Ecology|date=2011|volume=92|pages=1073–1082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ant-insect interactions==
Ants tend a wide variety of insect species, most notably [[Lycaenidae|lycaenid]] butterfly [[caterpillar]]s and hemipterans.&lt;ref name=sta/&gt; Forty-one percent of all ant genera include species that associate with insects.&lt;ref name=tho&gt;T.H. Oliver, S.R. Leather, and J.M. Cook, "Macroevolutionary patterns in the origin of mutualisms involving ants," Journal of Evolutionary Biology,  vol. 21, Nov. 2008, pp. 1597-1608.&lt;/ref&gt; In all ant-insect associations the ants provide some service in exchange for nutrients in the form of honeydew,  a sugary fluid excreted by many phytophagous insects.&lt;ref name=sta/&gt; Interactions between honeydew-producing insects and ants is often called [[trophobiosis]], a term which merges notions of trophic relationships with symbioses between ants and insects. This term has been criticized, however, on the basis that myrmecophilous interactions are often more complex than simple trophic interactions, and the use of symbiosis is inappropriate for describing interactions among free-living organisms.&lt;ref name=sta/&gt;

===Hemiptera===&lt;!-- note Homoptera are a group of the past --&gt;
[[File:Ant Receives Honeydew from Aphid.jpg|thumb|Ant obtaining honeydew from an aphid]]
[[File:Common jassid nymph and ant02.jpg|thumb|A leaf-hopper nymph tended by an ant]]
{{commons category|Ants cultivating aphids}}
Some of the most well-studied myrmecophilous interactions involve ants and hemipterans (earlier grouped in the order Homoptera which included the [[Auchenorrhyncha]] and [[Sternorrhyncha]]), especially [[aphid]]s. There are around 4000 described species of aphids, and they are the most abundant myrmecophilous organisms in the northern temperate zones.&lt;ref name=eow/&gt;&lt;ref name=sta/&gt; Aphids feed on the phloem sap of plants, and as they feed they excrete honeydew droplets from their anus. The tending ants ingest these honeydew droplets then return to their nest to regurgitate the fluid for their nestmates (see [[trophallaxis]]).&lt;ref name=holl/&gt; Between 90-95% of the dry weight of aphid honeydew is  various sugars, while the remaining matter includes vitamins, minerals, and amino acids.&lt;ref name=eow/&gt; Aphid honeydew can provide an abundant food source for ants (aphids in the genus ''[[Tuberolachnus]]'' can secrete more honeydew droplets per hour than their body weight) and for some ants aphids may be their only source of food. In these circumstances, ants may supplement their honeydew intake by preying on the aphids once the aphid populations have reached certain densities. In this way ants can gain extra protein and ensure efficient resource extraction by maintaining honeydew flow rates that do not exceed the ants' collection capabilities.&lt;ref name=eow/&gt; Even with some predation by ants, aphid colonies can reach larger densities with tending ants than colonies without. Ants have been observed to tend large "herds" of aphids, protecting them from predators and parasitoids. Aphid species that are associated with ants often have reduced structural and behavioral defense mechanisms, and are less able to defend themselves from attack than aphid species that are not associated with ants.&lt;ref name=eow/&gt;

Ants engage in associations with other honeydew-producing hemipterans such as scale insects (Coccidae), mealybugs (Pseudococcidae), and treehoppers (Membracidae), and most of these interaction are facultative and opportunistic with some cases of obligate associations, such as hemipterans that are [[inquiline]], meaning they can only survive inside ant nests.&lt;ref name=sta/&gt; In addition to protection, ants may provide other services in exchange for hemipteran honeydew. Some ants bring hemipteran larvae into the ant nests and rear them along with their own ant brood.&lt;ref name=eow/&gt; Additionally, ants may actively aid in hemipteran dispersal: queen ants have been observed transporting aphids during their dispersive flights to establish a new colony, and worker ants will often carry aphids to a new nesting site if the previous ant nest has been disturbed. Ants may also carry hemipterans to different parts of a plant or to different plants in order to ensure a fresh food source and/or adequate protection for the herd.

===Lycaenid butterflies===
[[File:Lycaenid ant sec.jpg|thumb|Ant tending a Lycaenid caterpillar]]
[[File:Loxura atymnus-Kadavoor-2018-06-18-001.jpg|thumb|''[[Loxura atymnus]]'' is famous for consuming nectar secreted from the [[Nectar#Extrafloral_nectaries|extrafloral nectaries]] stimulated by the ants. Here they are on a [[:en:Spathoglottis plicata|Philippine orchid]] bud along with some [[:en:Anoplolepis gracilipes|yellow crazy ants]].]]
Myrmecophily among lycaenid caterpillars differs from the associations of hemipterans because caterpillars feed on plant tissues, not phloem sap, and therefore do not continually excrete honeydew. Caterpillars of lycaenid butterflies have therefore evolved specialized organs that secrete chemicals to feed and appease ants.&lt;ref name=eow/&gt; The secretions are a mixture of sugar and amino acid which in synergy is more attractive to the ants than either component in its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wada|first=Ayako|last2=Isobe|first2=Yu|last3=Yamaguchi|first3=Susumu|last4=Yamaoka|first4=Ryohei|last5=Ozaki|first5=Mamiko|date=2001-10-01|title=Taste-enhancing Effects of Glycine on the Sweetness of Glucosea Gustatory Aspect of Symbiosis between the Ant, Camponotus japonicus, and the Larvae of the Lycaenid Butterfly, Niphanda fusca|url=https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/26/8/983/327687|journal=Chemical Senses|language=en|volume=26|issue=8|pages=983–992|doi=10.1093/chemse/26.8.983|issn=0379-864X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because caterpillars do not automatically pass honeydew, they must be stimulated to secrete droplets and do so in response to ant antennation, which is the drumming or stroking of the caterpillar's body by the ants' antennae.&lt;ref name=fied/&gt; Some caterpillars possess specialized receptors that allow them to distinguish between ant antennation and contact from predators and parasites, and others produce acoustic signals that agitate ants, making them more active and likely better defenders of the larvae.&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;A.A.

Fiedler, Systematic, evolutionary, and ecological implication of myrmecophily within the Lycaenidae,  UND Museum Alexander Koenig: Bonner Zoologische Monographien, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; As with homopteran myrmecophiles, ants protect Lycaenid larvae from predatory insects (including other ants) and parasitoid wasps, which lay their eggs in the bodies of many species of Lepidoptera larvae. For example, one study conducted by [[Naomi Pierce|Pierce]] and colleagues in Colorado experimentally found that for the larvae of ''[[Glaucopsyche lygdamus]]'' that were tended by a certain ant species (''[[Formica podzolica]]''), compared to untended larvae, the percentage of larvae disappearing from plants before late final instar decreased (not statistically significantly, though) and the percentage of larvae infected by parasitoids significantly decreased (from 33% to 9%–12%).&lt;ref name=amf&gt;A.M.

===Multiple levels of myrmecophily===
Many trophobiotic ants can simultaneously maintain associations with multiple species.&lt;ref name=tho/&gt; Ants that interact with myrmecophilous insects and myrmecophytes are highly associated: species that are adapted to interact with one of these myrmecophiles may switch among them depending on resource availability and quality. Of the ant genera that include species that associate with ant plants, 94% also include species that associate with trophobionts. In contrast, ants that are adapted to cultivate fungus (leaf cutter ants, tribe [[Attini]]) do not possess the morphological or behavioral adaptations to switch to trophobiotic partners.&lt;ref name=tho/&gt; Many ant mutualists can exploit these multi-species interactions to maximize the benefits of myrmecophily. For example, some plants will host aphids instead of investing in EFN's, which may be more energetically costly depending on local food availability.&lt;ref name=sta/&gt; The presence of multiple interactors can strongly influence the outcomes of myrmecophily, often in unexpected ways.&lt;ref name=jho&gt;J. Hoeksema and E. Bruna, "Pursuing the big questions about interspecific mutualism: a review of theoretical approaches," Oecologia,  vol. 125, 2000, pp. 321-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of myrmecophily in ecology==
Mutualisms are geographically ubiquitous, found in all organismic kingdoms, and play a major role in all ecosystems.&lt;ref name=jho/&gt;&lt;ref name=mdo&gt;M. Doebeli and N. Knowlton, "The evolution of interspecific mutualisms," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,  vol. 95, 1998, pp. 8676-8680.&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with the fact that ants are one of the most dominant lifeforms on earth,&lt;ref name=vric/&gt; it is clear that myrmecophily plays a significant role in the evolution and ecology of diverse organisms, and in the community structure of many terrestrial ecosystems.

===Evolution of positive interactions===
Questions of how and why species coevolve are of great interest and significance. In many myrmecophilous organisms it is clear that ant associations have been influential in the ecological success, diversity, and persistence of species. Analyses of phylogenetic information for myrmecophilous organisms as well as ant lineages have demonstrated that myrmecophily has arisen independently in most groups multiple times. Because there have been multiple gains (and perhaps losses) of myrmecophilous adaptations, the evolutionary sequence of events in most lineages is unknown.&lt;ref name=pier/&gt; Exactly how these associations evolve also remains unclear.

In studying the coevolution of myrmecophilous organisms, many researchers have addressed the relative costs and benefits of mutualistic interactions, which can vary drastically according to local species composition and abundance, variation in nutrient requirements and availability, host plant quality, presence of alternative food sources, abundance and composition of predator and parasitoid species, and abiotic conditions.&lt;ref name=tho/&gt; Because of the large amounts of variation in some of these factors, the mechanisms that support the stable persistence of myrmecophily are still unknown.&lt;ref name=jho/&gt; In many cases, variation in external factors can result in interactions that shift along a continuum of mutualism, commensalism, and even parasitism. In almost all mutualisms, the relative costs and benefits of interactions are asymmetrical; that is, one partner experiences greater benefits and/or fewer costs than the other partner. This asymmetry leads to "cheating," in which one partner evolves strategies to receive benefits without providing services in return. As with many other mutualisms, cheating has evolved in interactions between ants and their partners. For example, some lycaenid larvae are taken into ant nests where they prey on ant brood and offer no services to the ants.&lt;ref name=eow/&gt; Other lycaenids may parasitize ant-plant relationships by feeding on plants that are tended by ants, apparently immune to ant attack because of their own appeasing secretions. Hemipterophagous lycaenids engage in a similar form of parasitism in ant-hemipteran associations.&lt;ref name=heil/&gt; In light of the variability in outcomes of mutualistic interactions, and also the evolution of cheating in many systems, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms that maintain mutualism as an evolutionarily stable interaction.&lt;ref name=mdo/&gt;

===Species coexistence===
In addition to leading to coevolution, mutualisms also play an important role in structuring communities.&lt;ref name=jho/&gt; One of the most obvious ways in which myrmecophily influences community structure is by allowing for the coexistence of species which might otherwise be antagonists or competitors. For many myrmecophiles, engaging in ant associations is first and foremost a method of avoiding predation by ants. For example, the caterpillars of lycaenid butterflies are an ideal source of food for ants: they are slow-moving, soft-bodied, and highly nutritious, yet they have evolved complex structures to not only appease ant aggression but to elicit protective services from the ants.&lt;ref name=fied/&gt; In order to explain why ants cooperate with other species as opposed to preying on them, two related hypotheses have been proposed: cooperation either provides ants with resources that are otherwise difficult to find, or it ensures the long-term availability of those resources.&lt;ref name=sta/&gt;

===Community structure===
At both small and large spatiotemporal scales, mutualistic interactions influence patterns of species richness, distribution, and abundance.&lt;ref name=jjs&gt;J.J. Stachowicz, "Mutualism, Facilitation, and the Structure of Ecological Communities," BioScience,  vol. 51, Mar. 2001, pp. 235-246.&lt;/ref&gt; Myrmecophilous interactions play an important role in determining community structure by influencing inter- and intraspecific competition; regulating population densities of arthropods, fungi, and plants; determining arthropod species assemblages; and influencing trophic dynamics.&lt;ref name=sta/&gt; Recent work in tropical forests has shown that ant mutualisms may play key roles in structuring food webs, as ants can control entire communities of arthropods in forest canopies.&lt;ref name=heil/&gt; Myrmecophily has also been key in the ecological success of ants. Ant biomass and abundance in many ecosystems exceeds that of their potential prey, suggesting a strong role of myrmecophily in supporting larger populations of ants than would otherwise be possible.&lt;ref name=heil/&gt; Furthermore, by providing associational refugia and habitat amelioration for many species, ants are considered dominant ecosystem engineers.&lt;ref name=eow/&gt;&lt;ref name=jjs/&gt;

===Myrmecophily as a model system===
Myrmecophilous interactions provide an important model system for exploring ecological and evolutionary questions regarding coevolution, plant defense theory, food web structure, species coexistence, and evolutionarily stable strategies. Because many myrmecophilous relationships are easily manipulable and tractable, they allow for testing and experimentation that may not be possible in other interactions. Therefore, they provide ideal model systems in which to explore the magnitude, dynamics, and frequency of mutualism in nature.&lt;ref name=heil/&gt;

{{pp-move-indef}}
'''Nemesis''' is a [[hypothetical astronomical objects|hypothetical]] [[red dwarf]]&lt;ref name=Leader/&gt; or [[brown dwarf]],&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; originally postulated in 1984 &lt;ref&gt;{{M. Davis, P. Hut, and R. Muller, “Extinction of species by periodic comet showers,” Nature 308, 715 (1984).}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be orbiting the [[Sun]] at a distance of about 95,000 [[astronomical unit|AU]] (1.5 [[light-year]]s),&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; somewhat beyond the [[Oort cloud]], to explain a perceived [[Extinction event#Patterns in frequency|cycle of mass extinctions]] in the [[history of Earth|geological record]], which seem to occur more often at intervals of 26 million years.&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Raup1984/&gt; {{As of|2012}}, more than 1800 brown dwarfs have been identified.&lt;ref name="DwarfArchives"/&gt; There are actually fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought. Rather than one star for every brown dwarf, there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf.&lt;ref name="space2012"/&gt; The majority of [[Sun|solar]]-type stars are single.&lt;ref name=Deepak2010/&gt; The previous idea stated half or perhaps most stellar systems were binary, trinary, or multiple-star systems associated with clusters of stars, rather than the single-star systems that tend to be seen most often.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In a 2017 paper, Sarah Sadavoy and Steven Stahler argued that the Sun was likely part of a [[binary system]] at the time of its formation, leading them to suggest "there probably was a Nemesis, a long time ago.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/06/13/new-evidence-that-all-stars-are-born-in-pairs/|title=New evidence that all stars are born in pairs|date=2017-06-13|work=Berkeley News|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadavoy|first=Sarah I.|last2=Stahler|first2=Steven W.|date=2017-05-03|title=Embedded binaries and their dense cores|url=https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/469/4/3881/3795556%7Cjournal=Monthly|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|language=en|volume=469|issue=4|pages=3881–3900|doi=10.1093/mnras/stx1061|issn=0035-8711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a star would have separated from this binary system over four billion years ago, meaning it could not be responsible for the more recent perceived cycle of mass extinctions, [[Douglas Vakoch]] told ''[[Business Insider]]'', adding that "If the sun really was part of a binary star system in its early days, its early twin deserves a benign name like Companion, rather than the threatening Nemesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stars-form-in-pairs-nemesis-theory-2018-4|title=All stars in the universe may form in pairs — but we can't find the sun's missing 'Nemesis'|last=Levine|first=David|date=2018-06-19|website=Business Insider|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recent theories suggest that other forces, like close [[List of nearest stars#Future and past|passage of other stars]], or the angular effect of the galactic gravity plane working against the outer solar orbital plane, may be the cause of orbital perturbations of some outer Solar System objects.&lt;ref name=Kenyon/&gt; In 2011, Coryn Bailer-Jones analyzed craters on the surface of the Earth and reached the conclusion that the earlier findings of simple periodic patterns (implying periodic comet showers dislodged by a hypothetical Nemesis star) were [[statistical artifact]]s, and found that the crater record shows no evidence for Nemesis.&lt;ref name="Myth2011"/&gt; However, in 2010, [[Adrian Melott|A.L. Melott]]&lt;!--position?--&gt; and R.K. Bambach&lt;!--position?--&gt; found evidence in the fossil record confirming the extinction event periodicity originally claimed by Raup &amp; Sepkoski in 1984, but at a higher confidence level and over a time period nearly twice as long.&lt;ref name="melott"/&gt; The Infrared Astronomical Satellite ([[IRAS]]) failed to discover Nemesis in the 1980s. The [[2MASS]] [[astronomical survey]], which ran from 1997 to 2001, failed to detect an additional star or brown dwarf in the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Space2010-03"/&gt;

Using newer and more powerful infrared telescope technology which is able to detect brown dwarfs as cool as 150 [[kelvin]]s out to a distance of 10 [[light-year]]s from the Sun,&lt;ref name="browndwarf"/&gt; the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE survey) has not detected Nemesis.&lt;ref name="Morrison2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick2011v1"/&gt; In 2011, [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]], a senior scientist at NASA known for his work in risk assessment of near Earth objects, has written that there is no confidence in the existence of an object like Nemesis, since it should have been detected in infrared sky surveys.&lt;ref name="Morrison2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrison2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA20140307"/&gt;

==Claimed periodicity of mass extinctions==
In 1984, [[paleontologists]] [[David M. Raup|David Raup]] and [[Jack Sepkoski]] published a paper claiming that they had identified a statistical periodicity in extinction rates over the last 250 million years using various forms of [[Time series|time series analysis]].&lt;ref name=Raup1984/&gt; They focused on the extinction intensity of [[fossil]] families of marine [[vertebrates]], [[invertebrates]], and [[protozoans]], identifying 12 [[extinction event]]s over the time period in question. The average time interval between extinction events was determined as 26 million years. At the time, two of the identified extinction events ([[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous–Paleogene]] and [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event|Eocene–Oligocene]]) could be shown to coincide with large impact events. Although Raup and Sepkoski could not identify the cause of their supposed periodicity, they suggested a possible non-terrestrial connection. The challenge to propose a mechanism was quickly addressed by several teams of astronomers.&lt;ref name=Whitmire1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis1984/&gt;

In 2010, Melott &amp; Bambach re-examined the fossil data, including the now-improved dating, and using a second independent database in addition to that Raup &amp; Sepkoski had used. They found evidence for a signal showing an excess extinction rate with a 27-million-year periodicity, now going back 500 million years, and at a much higher statistical significance than in the older work. They also determined that this periodicity is inconsistent with the Nemesis hypothesis. The change from 26 to 27 million years is expected based on a 3% "stretch" in the geological timescale since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="melott"/&gt;

==Development of the Nemesis hypotheses==
Two teams of [[astronomer]]s, Daniel P. Whitmire and Albert A. Jackson IV, and [[Marc Davis (astronomer)|Marc Davis]], [[Piet Hut]], and [[Richard A. Muller]], independently published similar [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain Raup and Sepkoski's extinction periodicity in the same issue of the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref name=Whitmire1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis1984/&gt; This hypothesis proposes that the Sun may have an undetected [[Binary Star|companion star]] in a highly elliptical orbit that periodically disturbs [[comet]]s in the [[Oort cloud]], causing a large increase of the number of comets visiting the inner Solar System with a consequential increase of [[impact event]]s on Earth. This became known as the "Nemesis" or "Death Star" hypothesis.

If it does exist, the exact nature of Nemesis is uncertain. Muller suggests that the most likely object is a [[red dwarf]] with an [[apparent magnitude]] between 7 and 12,&lt;ref name="Muller"/&gt; while Daniel P. Whitmire and Albert A. Jackson argue for a [[brown dwarf]].&lt;ref name="Whitmire1984"/&gt; If a red dwarf, it would exist in [[star catalog]]s, but it would only be confirmed by measuring its [[parallax]]; due to orbiting the Sun it would have a low [[proper motion]] and would escape detection by older proper motion surveys that have found stars like the 9th-magnitude [[Barnard's star]]. (The proper motion of Barnard's star was detected in 1916.)&lt;ref name="EEB"/&gt; Muller expects Nemesis to be discovered by the time parallax surveys reach the 10th magnitude.&lt;ref name="Muller2002"/&gt;

Muller, referring to the date of a recent extinction at 11 million years before the present day, posits that Nemesis has a [[semi-major axis]] of about {{convert|1.5|ly}}&lt;ref name="Muller"/&gt; and suggests it is located (supported by Yarris, 1987) near [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], based on a hypothetical orbit derived from original [[aphelion]]s of a number of atypical long-period comets that describe an orbital arc meeting the specifications of Muller's hypothesis. Richard Muller's most recent paper relevant to the Nemesis theory was published in 2002.&lt;ref name="Muller"/&gt; In 2002, Muller speculated that Nemesis was [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] 400 million years ago by a [[List of nearest stars#Future and past|passing star]] from a circular orbit into an orbit with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.7.&lt;ref name="Muller2002"/&gt;

==Orbit of Sedna==
[[File:Oort cloud Sedna orbit.svg|thumb|300px|Sedna orbit compared to the Solar System and Oort cloud]]

The [[trans-Neptunian object]] [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]] has an extra-long and unusual elliptical orbit around the Sun,&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; ranging between 76 and 937 AU. Sedna's orbit is estimated to last between 10.5 and 12 thousand years. Its discoverer, [[Michael E. Brown|Michael Brown]] of Caltech, noted in a ''Discover'' magazine article that Sedna's location seemed to defy reasoning: "Sedna shouldn't be there", Brown said. "There's no way to put Sedna where it is. It never comes close enough to be affected by the Sun, but it never goes far enough away from the Sun to be affected by other stars."&lt;ref name="discover2006"/&gt; Brown therefore postulated that a massive unseen object may be responsible for Sedna's anomalous orbit.&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; This line of inquiry eventually led to the hypothesis of [[Planet Nine]].

Brown has stated that it is more likely that one or more non-companion stars, passing near the Sun billions of years ago, could have pulled Sedna out into its current orbit.&lt;ref name="discover2006"/&gt; In 2004, Kenyon forwarded this explanation after analysis of Sedna's orbital data and computer modeling of possible ancient non-companion star passes.&lt;ref name=Kenyon/&gt;

==Past, current, and pending searches for Nemesis==
Searches for Nemesis in the infrared are important because cooler stars comparatively shine more brightly in infrared light. The [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]]'s [[Leuschner Observatory]] failed to discover Nemesis by 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=Ph.D. |title=An Astrometric Search for a Stellar Companion to the Sun |last=Perlmutter |first=Saul |authorlink=Saul Perlmutter |date=1986 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Infrared Astronomical Satellite ([[IRAS]]) failed to discover Nemesis in the 1980s. The [[2MASS]] [[astronomical survey]], which ran from 1997 to 2001, failed to detect a star, or brown dwarf, in the Solar System.&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; If Nemesis exists, it may be detected by [[Pan-STARRS]] or the planned [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope|LSST]] astronomical surveys.

In particular, if Nemesis is a [[red dwarf]] or a [[brown dwarf]], the [[WISE mission]] (an infrared sky survey that covered most of our solar neighborhood in movement-verifying [[parallax]] measurements) was expected to be able to find it.&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; WISE can detect 150-kelvin brown dwarfs out to 10 [[light-year]]s. But the closer a brown dwarf is, the easier it is to detect.&lt;ref name="browndwarf"/&gt; Preliminary results of the WISE survey were released on April 14, 2011.&lt;ref name=NASA2011-117/&gt; On March 14, 2012, the entire catalog of the WISE mission was released.&lt;ref name="fullrelease"/&gt; In 2014 WISE data ruled out a [[Saturn]] or larger-sized body in the Oort cloud out to ten thousand AU.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/march/nasas-wise-survey-finds-thousands-of-new-stars-but-no-planet-x/ NASA's WISE Survey Finds Thousands of New Stars, But No 'Planet X']&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculations in the 1980s suggested that a Nemesis object would have an irregular orbit due to  perturbations from the galaxy and passing stars. The Melott &amp; Bambach work&lt;ref name="melott"/&gt; shows an extremely regular signal, inconsistent with the expected irregularities in such an orbit. Thus, while supporting the extinction periodicity, it appears to be inconsistent with the Nemesis hypothesis, though of course not inconsistent with other kinds of [[substellar object]]s. According to a 2011 NASA news release, "recent scientific analysis no longer supports the idea that extinctions on Earth happen at regular, repeating intervals, and thus, the Nemesis hypothesis is no longer needed."&lt;ref name="Tyche2011-060"/&gt;

The '''NowCast'''  is a [[weighted average]] of hourly air monitoring data used by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] for real-time reporting of the [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI) for PM (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; or PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) or Ozone data.

The PM NowCast is computed from the most recent 12 hours of PM monitoring data, but the NowCast weights the most recent hours of data more heavily than an ordinary 12-hour average when pollutant levels are changing. The PM NowCast is used in lieu of a 24-hour average PM concentration in the calculation of the AQI until an entire calendar day of hourly concentrations has been monitored.

Similarly, the Ozone NowCast is computed from the most recent 8 hours of ozone monitoring data, but weights the most recent hours of data more heavily than an eight-hour average when pollutant levels are changing. The Ozone NowCast is used in lieu of a forward rolling 8-hour average for the calculation of the AQI until an entire calendar day of data hourly data is available.

==Calculation of the PM NowCast==
Let c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...c&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; represent the hourly PM concentrations for the most recent 12-hour period, with c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the most recent hourly value, and  let c&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; and c&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; represent the minimum and maximum hourly concentration for the 12-hour period.&lt;br /&gt;
 
Define:

:&lt;math&gt;w^*=\frac{c_{min}}{c_{max}}
&lt;/math&gt;
and let
:&lt;math&gt;w =
\begin{cases}
 w^*&amp; \mbox{if } w^* &gt; \frac{1}{2}, \\
 \frac{1}{2} &amp; \mbox{if } w^*\le \frac{1}{2}. \\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

With these definitions the PM NowCast&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/airnow/faq/Nowcast-formula.pptx|format=PPTX|title=Computing the NowCast|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;NowCast = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{12} w^{i-1} c_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{12}w^{i-1}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
For the special case where there is no variability in the hourly values, c&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; = c&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, w = 1, and the NowCast reduces to the twelve-hour average:

:&lt;math&gt;NowCast = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{12} c_i}{12}.
&lt;/math&gt;

For the special case where w=1/2:

:&lt;math&gt;NowCast = \frac{ c_1+({\frac{1}{2}})c_2+...+{(\frac

{1}{2}})^{11}{c_{12}} }
{1+\frac{1}{2}+({\frac{1}{2}})^{2}+...+{(\frac{1}{2}})^{11}}
&lt;/math&gt;

But 1/(1-x)=1 + x + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+ ... , x &lt; 1, so to a good approximation, when w = 1/2:
:&lt;math&gt;NowCast = \frac{1}{2}c_1+({\frac{1}{2}})^2 c_2+...+{(\frac

{1}{2}})^{12}{c_{12}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Because the most recent hours of data are weighted so heavily in the NowCast when PM levels are changing, EPA does not report the NowCast when data is missing for  c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Calculation of the Ozone NowCast==
Let c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...c&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; represent the hourly ozone concentrations for the most recent 8-hour period, with c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the most recent hourly value, and  let c&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; and c&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; represent the minimum and maximum hourly concentration for the 8-hour period.&lt;br/&gt;
 
Define:

:&lt;math&gt;w=\frac{c_{min}}{c_{max}}
&lt;/math&gt;

With these definitions the Ozone NowCast is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forum.airnowtech.org/t/airnow-updates-to-ozone-real-time-reporting-and-daily-reporting/151|title=Ozone NowCast|publisher=AirNow|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:
:&lt;math&gt;NowCast = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{8} w^{i-1} c_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{8}w^{i-1}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note: USEPA generally truncates ozone values to whole PPB, so a value of 13.78 PPB would use a value of 13.0 in the NowCast calculation, and a value of 0.01378 PPM would use a value 0.013 PPM.  Using un-truncated numbers may yield discrepancies with forecast data presented at the AIRNow site.

==Example==
Consider a day when the hourly average PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is zero for all hours of the day, except for a single hour from noon to 1 pm, where a monitor records a concentration pulse of 71 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).  According to the equation above, the Nowcast is 71/2&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=35.5&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  the hour after the pulse, two hours later it is 71/4&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=17.8&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and three hours later it is 71/8&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;= 8.9&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. To calculate the corresponding AQI values, each NowCast concentration is substituted into the AQI equation in place of the 24-hour average PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; concentration:

:&lt;math&gt; I  = \frac {C-C_{low}}{ C_{high} -C_{low} }(I_{high} -I_{low}) +I_{low} &lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; =  the AQI,
:&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; =  the 24-hour average PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; pollutant concentration,
:&lt;math&gt;C_{low}&lt;/math&gt;=  the concentration breakpoint that is ≤ &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;C_{high}&lt;/math&gt;=  the concentration breakpoint that is  ≥  &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;I_{low}&lt;/math&gt;=  the index breakpoint corresponding to &lt;math&gt;C_{low}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;I_{high}&lt;/math&gt;=  the index breakpoint corresponding to &lt;math&gt;C_{high}&lt;/math&gt;.

and:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
|&lt;math&gt;C_{low}&lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;C_{high}&lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;I_{low}&lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;I_{high}&lt;/math&gt;|| Category

|}

Thus, the three NowCast concentrations correspond to air quality indices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=resources.conc_aqi_calc|title=AQI Calculator: Concentration to AQI|publisher=AirNow|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 101, (AQI Color Code Orange, Air Quality: Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups), 63 (AQI Color Code Yellow, Air Quality: Moderate ), and 37 (AQI Color Code Green, Air Quality: Good) respectively.  
After the day is over and all of the hourly data is available, the AQI for the day is calculated from the 24-hr average; 71/24&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;= 3.0&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, an AQI of 12 (Color Code Green, Air Quality: Good). EPA has developed a calculator to compute the PM NowCast, AQI, and AQI category and color from the most recent 12 hours of monitoring data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/airnow/aqicalctest/nowcast.htm|title=NowCast Calculator|publisher=AirNow|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the concept ==
[[File:Alfred Wegener ca.1924-30.jpg|thumb|Alfred Wegener ca.1924-30]]
The name "Pangaea/Pangea" is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] ''pan'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|πᾶν}}}}, "all, entire, whole") and ''[[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|Γαῖα}}}}, "[[Mother goddess|Mother Earth]], land").&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=Pangaea|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Pangaea&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|As "Pangaea", it appears in [[Greek mythology]] as [[Pangaea (mountain)|a mountain battle site]] during the [[Titanomachia]]. As "Pangaeus", it was the name of a specific mountain range in southern [[Thrace]]. "Pangaea" also appears in [[Vergil]]'s ''Georgics''&lt;ref&gt;Vergilius Mario, Publius. ''Georgicon'', IV.462&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lucan]]'s ''Pharsalia''&lt;ref&gt;Lucan. ''Pharsalia'', I.679&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C.T. &amp;&amp;nbsp;al. "Pangaeus" in ''A Latin Dictionary''.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=cwGHCN6vcBIC&amp;pg=PA45 ''Scholia in Lucani Bellum Civile'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;I.] (Leipzig), 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The concept that the continents once formed a continuous land mass was first proposed by [[Alfred Wegener]], the originator of the [[scientific theory]] of [[continental drift]], in his 1912 publication ''The Origin of Continents'' (''Die Entstehung der Kontinente'').&lt;ref name="Petermann"&gt;Alfred Wegener: ''Die Entstehung der Kontinente.'' Dr. A. Petermann's Mitteilungen aus Justus Perthes' Geographischer Anstalt, 58(1): Gotha 1912&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded upon his hypothesis in his 1915 book ''The Origin of Continents and Oceans'' (''Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane''), in which he postulated that, before breaking up and drifting to their present locations, all the continents had formed a single [[supercontinent]] that he called the "''Urkontinent''".

The name "Pangea" occurs in the 1920 edition of ''Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane'', but only once, when Wegener refers to the ancient supercontinent as "the Pangaea of the Carboniferous".&lt;ref&gt;See:

==Formation==
[[File:Appalachian orogeny.jpg|thumb|left|Appalachian orogeny]]
The forming of supercontinents and their breaking up appears to have been [[supercontinent cycle|cyclical]] through Earth's history. There may have been [[List of supercontinents|many others]] before Pangaea. The fourth-last supercontinent, called [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] or Nuna, appears to have assembled in the period 2.0–1.8 [[Gya|Ga.]]&lt;ref name="Zhao1"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Guochun|last=Zhao|author2=Cawood, Peter A. |author3=Wilde, Simon A. |author4= Sun, M. |date=2002|title=Review of global 2.1–1.8 Ga orogens: implications for a pre-Rodinia supercontinent|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=59|pages=125–162|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00073-9 |bibcode=2002ESRv...59..125Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhao2"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Guochun|last=Zhao|author2=Sun, M. |author3=Wilde, Simon A. |author4= Li, S.Z. |date=2004|title=A Paleo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent: assembly, growth and breakup|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=67|pages=91–123|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2004.02.003|bibcode=2004ESRv...67...91Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia/Nuna broke up and the next supercontinent, [[Rodinia]], formed from the [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] and assembly of its fragments. Rodinia lasted from about 1.1 billion years ago (Ga) until about 750 million years ago, but its exact configuration and geodynamic history are not nearly as well understood as those of the later supercontinents, [[Pannotia]] and Pangaea.

When Rodinia broke up, it split into three pieces: the supercontinent of [[Proto-Laurasia]], the supercontinent of [[Proto-Gondwana]], and the smaller [[Congo craton]]. Proto-Laurasia and Proto-Gondwana were separated by the [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]]. Next [[Proto-Laurasia]] itself split apart to form the continents of [[Laurentia]], [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] and [[Baltica]]. Baltica moved to the east of Laurentia, and Siberia moved northeast of Laurentia. The splitting also created two new oceans, the [[Iapetus Ocean]] and [[Paleoasian Ocean]]. Most of the above masses coalesced again to form the relatively short-lived supercontinent of [[Pannotia]]. This supercontinent included large amounts of land near the poles and, near the equator, only a relatively small strip connecting the polar masses. Pannotia lasted until 540&amp;nbsp;Ma, near the beginning of the [[Cambrian]] period and then broke up, giving rise to the continents of [[Laurentia]], [[Baltica]], and the southern supercontinent of [[Gondwana]].

In the [[Cambrian]] period, the continent of [[Laurentia]], which would later become [[North America]], sat on the [[equator]], with three bordering oceans: the [[Panthalassic Ocean]] to the north and west, the [[Iapetus Ocean]] to the south and the [[Khanty Ocean]] to the east. In the Earliest [[Ordovician]], around 480&amp;nbsp;Ma, the microcontinent of [[Avalonia]] – a landmass incorporating fragments of what would become eastern [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], the southern [[British Isles]], and parts of [[Belgium]], northern [[France]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[New England]], South [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and northwest Africa – broke free from Gondwana and began its journey to [[Laurentia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Stanley| first = Steven| authorlink = Steven M. Stanley| title = Earth System History| date = 1998| location = USA| pages = 355–359 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baltica, Laurentia, and Avalonia all came together by the end of the Ordovician to form a minor supercontinent called [[Euramerica]] or Laurussia, closing the Iapetus Ocean. The collision also resulted in the formation of the northern [[Appalachians]]. [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] sat near Euramerica, with the [[Khanty Ocean]] between the two continents. While all this was happening, Gondwana drifted slowly towards the South Pole. This was the first step of the formation of Pangaea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Stanley| first = Steven| authorlink = Steven M. Stanley| title = Earth System History| date = 1998| location = USA| pages = 386–392 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second step in the formation of Pangaea was the collision of Gondwana with [[Euramerica]]. By the [[Silurian]], 440&amp;nbsp;Ma, Baltica had already collided with Laurentia, forming Euramerica. [[Avalonia]] had not yet collided with [[Laurentia]], but as Avalonia inched towards Laurentia, the seaway between them, a remnant of the [[Iapetus Ocean]], was slowly shrinking. Meanwhile, [[southern Europe]] broke off from Gondwana and began to move towards Euramerica across the newly formed [[Rheic Ocean]]. It collided with southern [[Baltica]] in the [[Devonian]], though this microcontinent was an underwater plate. The Iapetus Ocean's sister ocean, the Khanty Ocean, shrank as an island arc from Siberia collided with eastern Baltica (now part of Euramerica). Behind this [[island arc]] was a new ocean, the [[Ural Ocean]].

By the late Silurian, [[North China (continent)|North]] and [[South China (continent)|South China]] split from Gondwana and started to head northward, shrinking the Proto-Tethys Ocean in their path and opening the new [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]] to their south. In the Devonian Period, Gondwana itself headed towards Euramerica, causing the Rheic Ocean to shrink. In the Early [[Carboniferous]], northwest [[Africa]] had touched the southeastern coast of [[Euramerica]], creating the southern portion of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], the [[Meseta Mountains]] and the [[Mauritanide Belt|Mauritanide Mountains]]. [[South America]] moved northward to southern Euramerica, while the eastern portion of Gondwana ([[India]], [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]]) headed toward the South Pole from the [[equator]]. North and South China were on independent continents. The [[Kazakhstania]] microcontinent had collided with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]]. (Siberia had been a separate continent for millions of years since the deformation of the supercontinent [[Pannotia]] in the Middle Carboniferous.)

Western [[Kazakhstania]] collided with [[Baltica]] in the Late Carboniferous, closing the [[Ural Ocean]] between them and the western Proto-Tethys in them ([[Uralian orogeny]]), causing the formation of not only the [[Ural Mountains]] but also the supercontinent of Laurasia. This was the last step of the formation of Pangaea. Meanwhile, South America had collided with southern [[Laurentia]], closing the [[Rheic Ocean]] and forming the southernmost part of the [[Appalachians]] and [[Ouachita Mountains]]. By this time, Gondwana was positioned near the South Pole and glaciers were forming in Antarctica, India, Australia, southern Africa and South America. The [[North China]] block collided with [[Siberia]] by the Late Carboniferous, completely closing the Proto-Tethys Ocean.

By the early [[Permian]], the [[Cimmerian plate]] split from [[Gondwana]] and headed towards Laurasia, thus closing the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], but forming a new ocean, the [[Tethys Ocean]], in its southern end. Most of the landmasses were all in one. By the [[Triassic]] Period, Pangaea rotated a little and the Cimmerian plate was still travelling across the shrinking Paleo-Tethys, until the [[Middle Jurassic]]. The Paleo-Tethys had closed from west to east, creating the [[Cimmerian Orogeny]]. Pangaea, which looked like a ''C'', with the new Tethys Ocean inside the ''C'', had rifted by the Middle Jurassic, and its deformation is explained below.

==Evidence of existence==
[[File:Snider-Pellegrini Wegener fossil map.svg|thumb|right|middle|upright=1.25|The distribution of fossils across the continents is one line of evidence pointing to the existence of Pangaea.]]
[[Fossil]] evidence for Pangaea includes the presence of similar and identical species on continents that are now great distances apart. For example, fossils of the [[therapsid]] ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'' have been found in [[South Africa]], [[India]] and [[Antarctica]], alongside members of the ''[[Glossopteris]]'' flora, whose distribution would have ranged from the polar circle to the equator if the continents had been in their present position; similarly, the freshwater reptile ''[[Mesosaurus]]'' has been found in only localized regions of the coasts of [[Brazil]] and [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Benton, M.J. (2005) ''Vertebrate Palaeontology''. Third edition, Oxford, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional evidence for Pangaea is found in the [[geology]] of adjacent continents, including matching geological trends between the eastern coast of [[South America]] and the western coast of [[Africa]]. The [[polar ice cap]] of the [[Carboniferous]] Period covered the southern end of Pangaea. Glacial deposits, specifically [[till]], of the same age and structure are found on many separate continents that would have been together in the continent of Pangaea.&lt;ref&gt;Murck, Barbara W. and Skinner, Brian J. (1999) ''Geology Today: Understanding Our Planet, Study Guide'', Wiley, {{ISBN|978-0-471-32323-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paleomagnetic]] study of apparent polar wandering paths also support the theory of a supercontinent. Geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks; when rocks are formed, they take on the magnetic properties of the Earth and indicate in which direction the poles lie relative to the rock. Since the magnetic poles [[Polar drift|drift]] about the rotational pole with a period of only a few thousand years, measurements from numerous lavas spanning several thousand years are averaged to give an apparent mean polar position. Samples of [[sedimentary rock]] and [[intrusive igneous rock]] have magnetic orientations that are typically an average of the "secular variation" in the orientation of [[magnetic north]] because their [[Remanence|remanent]] magnetizations are not acquired instantaneously. Magnetic differences between sample groups whose age varies by millions of years is due to a combination of [[true polar wander]] and the drifting of continents. The true polar wander component is identical for all samples, and can be removed, leaving geologists with the portion of this motion that shows continental drift and can be used to help reconstruct earlier continental positions.&lt;ref&gt;Kearey, Philip; Klepeis, Keith A. and Vine, Frederick J. (2009). ''Global Tectonics'' (3rd. ed), pp. 66–67. Chichester:Wiley. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0777-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continuity of mountain chains provides further evidence for Pangaea. One example of this is the [[Appalachian Mountains]] chain, which extends from the southeastern [[United States]] to the [[Caledonides]] of Ireland, Britain, Greenland, and [[Scandinavian Caledonides|Scandinavia]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Merali, Zeeya and Skinner, Brian J. (2009) ''Visualizing Earth Science'', Wiley, {{ISBN|047174705X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rifting and break-up==
[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|left|Animation of the rifting of Pangaea]]
There were three major phases in the break-up of Pangaea. The first phase began in the [[Early Jurassic|Early]]-[[Middle Jurassic]] (about 175 Ma), when Pangaea began to rift from the Tethys Ocean in the east to the [[Pacific]] in the west. The rifting that took place between North America and Africa produced multiple [[Eastern North America Rift Basins|failed rifts]]. One rift resulted in a new ocean, the North [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The Atlantic Ocean did not open uniformly; rifting began in the north-central Atlantic. The [[South Atlantic]] did not open until the [[Cretaceous]] when Laurasia started to rotate clockwise and moved northward with North America to the north, and [[Eurasia]] to the south. The clockwise motion of Laurasia led much later to the closing of the [[Tethys Ocean]] and the widening of the "Sinus Borealis", which later became the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Meanwhile, on the other side of Africa and along the adjacent margins of east Africa, Antarctica and [[Madagascar]], new rifts were forming that would lead to the formation of the southwestern [[Indian Ocean]] that would open up in the Cretaceous.

The second major phase in the break-up of Pangaea began in the [[Early Cretaceous]] (150–140&amp;nbsp;Ma), when the minor supercontinent of Gondwana separated into multiple continents (Africa, South America, India, Antarctica, and Australia). The subduction at [[Tethyan Trench]] probably caused Africa, India and Australia to move northward, causing the opening of a "South Indian Ocean". In the Early Cretaceous, [[Atlantica]], today's South America and Africa, finally separated from eastern Gondwana (Antarctica, India and Australia). Then in the Middle Cretaceous, Gondwana fragmented to open up the South Atlantic Ocean as South America started to move westward away from Africa. The South Atlantic did not develop uniformly; rather, it rifted from south to north.

Also, at the same time, [[Madagascar]] and India began to separate from Antarctica and moved northward, opening up the Indian Ocean. Madagascar and India separated from each other 100–90&amp;nbsp;Ma in the Late Cretaceous. India continued to move northward toward Eurasia at 15 centimeters (6&amp;nbsp;in) a year (a plate tectonic record), closing the eastern Tethys Ocean, while Madagascar stopped and became locked to the [[African Plate]]. [[New Zealand]], [[New Caledonia]] and the rest of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]] began to separate from Australia, moving eastward toward the [[Pacific]] and opening the [[Coral Sea]] and [[Tasman Sea]].

The third major and final phase of the break-up of Pangaea occurred in the early [[Cenozoic]] ([[Paleocene]] to [[Oligocene]]). [[Laurasia]] split when North America/Greenland (also called [[Laurentia]]) broke free from Eurasia, opening the [[Norwegian Sea]] about 60–55&amp;nbsp;Ma. The Atlantic and Indian Oceans continued to expand, closing the Tethys Ocean.

Meanwhile, Australia split from Antarctica and moved quickly northward, just as India had done more than 40 million years before. Australia is currently on a collision course with [[eastern Asia]]. Both Australia and India are currently moving northeast at 5–6&amp;nbsp;centimeters (2–3&amp;nbsp;in) a year. Antarctica has been near or at the South Pole since the formation of Pangaea about 280&amp;nbsp;Ma. India started to collide with [[Asia]] beginning about 35&amp;nbsp;Ma, forming the [[Himalayan orogeny]], and also finally closing the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys Seaway]]; this collision continues today. The African Plate started to change directions, from west to northwest toward [[Europe]], and South America began to move in a northward direction, separating it from Antarctica and allowing complete oceanic circulation around Antarctica for the first time. This motion, together with decreasing atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations, caused a rapid cooling of Antarctica and allowed [[glacier]]s to form. This glaciation eventually coalesced into the kilometers-thick ice sheets seen today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature01290|pmid=12529638|title=Rapid Cenozoic glaciation of Antarctica induced by declining atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Nature|volume=421|issue=6920|pages=245–9|year=2003|last1=Deconto|first1=Robert M.|last2=Pollard|first2=David|bibcode=2003Natur.421..245D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major events took place during the [[Cenozoic]], including the opening of the [[Gulf of California]], the uplift of the [[Alps]], and the opening of the [[Sea of Japan]]. The break-up of Pangaea continues today in the [[Red Sea Rift]] and [[East African Rift]].

== Tectonic plate shift ==
[[File:Pangaea to present.gif|thumb|The breakup of Pangaea over time]]
Pangaea's formation is now commonly explained in terms of [[plate tectonics]]. The involvement of plate tectonics in Pangaea's&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt; separation helps to show how it did not separate all at once, but at different times, in sequences. Additionally, after these separations, it has also been discovered that the separated land masses may have also continued to break apart multiple times. The formation of each [[Ecology#Physical environments|environment]] and climate on Pangaea is due to plate tectonics, and thus, it is as a result of these shifts and changes different climatic pressures were placed on the life on Pangaea. Although plate tectonics was paramount in the formation of later land masses, it was also essential in the placement, climate, environments, habitats, and overall structure of Pangaea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Facts About Pangaea, Ancient Supercontinent|url = http://www.livescience.com/38218-facts-about-pangaea.html|website = LiveScience.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What can also be observed in relation to tectonic plates and Pangaea, is the formations to such plates. Mountains and valleys form due to tectonic collisions as well as earthquakes and chasms. Consequentially, this shaped Pangaea and animal [[adaptation]]s. Furthermore, plate tectonics can contribute to [[Volcano|volcanic activity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pangaea to the Present Lesson #2 {{!}} Volcano World {{!}} Oregon State University|url = http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/pangaea-present-lesson-2|website = volcano.oregonstate.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is responsible for extinctions and adaptations that have evidently affected life over time, and without doubt on Pangaea.

== Life ==
[[File:Ammonites 180308.jpg|thumb|Example of an ammonite]]
For the approximately 160 million years Pangaea existed, many species did well, whereas others struggled. The [[Traversodontidae|Traversodonts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New material of ''Dadadon isaloi'' (Cynodontia, Traversodontidae) from the Triassic of Madagascar|journal =Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume =31|issue =6|pages =1292–1302|doi=10.1080/02724634.2011.618154|year =2011|last1 =Ranivoharimanana|first1 =Lovasoa|last2 =Kammerer|first2 =Christian F.|last3 =Flynn|first3 =John J.|last4 =Wyss|first4 =André R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; were an example of such successful animals. Plants dependent on [[spore]] reproduction were largely replaced by the [[gymnosperm]]s, which reproduce through the use of seeds. Later on, insects (including beetles and cicadas) also thrived, during the [[Permian]] period 299 to 252 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Permian Period: Climate, Animals &amp; Plants|url = http://www.livescience.com/43219-permian-period-climate-animals-plants.html|website = LiveScience.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian extinction]] at 252 Mya greatly impacted these insects in mass extinction, being the only mass extinction to affect insects. When the [[Triassic]] Period came, many reptiles were able to also thrive, including Archosaurs, which were an ancestor to modern-day crocodiles and birds.

Little is known about marine life during the existence of Pangaea. Scientists are unable to find substantial evidence or fossilized remains in order to assist them in answering such questions. However, a couple of marine animals have been determined to have existed at the time - the [[Ammonoidea|Ammonites]] and [[Brachiopod]]s. Additionally, evidence pointing towards massive reefs with varied ecosystems, especially in the species of sponges and coral, have also been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1=George |title=Pangea: Paleoclimate, Tectonics, and Sedimentation During Accretion, Zenith, and Breakup of a Supercontinent |date=1994 |publisher=Geological Society of America |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change after Pangaea ==
The reconfiguration of continents and oceans after the breakup of Pangea changed the world's climate. There is scientific evidence that this change was drastic. When the continents separated and reformed themselves, it changed the flow of the oceanic currents and winds. The scientific reasoning behind all of the changes is [[Continental drift|Continental Drift]]. The theory of Continental Drift, created by [[Alfred Wegener]], explained how the continents shifted Earth’s surface and how that affected many aspects such as climate, rock formations found on different continents and plant and animal fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alfred Wegener|url = http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/wegener.html|website = www.ucmp.berkeley.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wegener studied plant fossils from the frigid Arctic of [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]]. He determined that such plants were not adapted to a glacial climate. The fossils he found were from tropical plants that were adapted to thrive in warmer and tropical climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi= 10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.03.052| title= Palaeoclimate across the Late Pennsylvanian–Early Permian tropical palaeolatitudes: A review of climate indicators, their distribution, and relation to palaeophysiographic climate factors|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology| volume= 268| issue= 3–4|pages=293–310|year=2008|last1=Tabor|first1=Neil J.|last2=Poulsen|first2=Christopher J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he would not assume that the plant fossils were capable of traveling to a different place, he suspected that Svalbard had had a warmer, less frigid climate in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = continental drift|url = http://education.nationalgeographic.com/encyclopedia/continental-drift/|website = National Geographic Education|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Pangaea separated, the reorganization of the continents changed the function of the oceans and seaways. The restructuring of the continents, changed and altered the distribution of warmth and coolness of the oceans. When North America and South America connected, it stopped equatorial currents from passing from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="Sea Level Change"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sea Level Change|url = http://cgge.aag.org/GlobalClimateChange1e/cfpart2/cfpart24.html|website = cgge.aag.org|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found evidence by using computer hydrological models to show that this strengthened the Gulf Stream by diverting more warm currents towards Europe. Warm waters at high latitudes led to an increased evaporation and eventually atmospheric moisture. Increased evaporation and atmospheric moisture resulted in increased precipitation. Evidence of increased precipitation is the development of snow and ice that covers Greenland, which led to an accumulation of the icecap. Greenland’s growing ice cap led to further [[global cooling]].&lt;ref name="Sea Level Change"/&gt; Scientists also found evidence of global cooling through the separation of Australia and Antarctica and the formation of the Antarctic Ocean. Ocean currents in the newly formed Antarctic or Southern Ocean created a circumpolar current.&lt;ref name="Sea Level Change"/&gt; The creation of the new ocean that caused a circumpolar current eventually led to atmospheric currents that rotated from west to east. Atmospheric and oceanic currents stopped the transfer of warm, tropical air and water to the higher latitudes. As a result of the warm air and currents moving northward, Antarctica cooled down so much that it became frigid.

Although many of Alfred Wegener’s theories and conclusions were valid, scientists are constantly coming up with new innovative ideas or reasoning behind why certain things happen. Wegener’s theory of Continental Drift was later replaced by the theory of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Continental Drift: Theory &amp; Definition|url = http://www.livescience.com/37529-continental-drift.html|website = LiveScience.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications of extinction ==
There is evidence to suggest that the deterioration of northern Pangaea contributed to the [[Permian Extinction]], one of Earth’s five major mass extinction events, which resulted in the loss of over 90% of marine and 70% of terrestrial species. There were three main sources of environmental deterioration that are believed to have had a hand in the extinction event.

The first of these sources is a loss of oxygen concentration in the ocean, which caused deep water regions called the [[lysocline]] to grow shallower. With the lysocline shrinking, there were fewer places for [[calcite]] to dissolve in the ocean, considering calcite only dissolves at deep ocean depths. This led to the extinction of [[carbonate]] producers such as [[brachiopod]]s and [[coral]]s that relied on dissolved calcite to survive. The second source is the eruption of the [[Siberian Traps]], a large volcanic event that is argued to be the result of Pangaean tectonic movement.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|author=Ivanov, A. V. |title=Evaluation of different models for the origin of the Siberian traps|doi=10.1130/2007.2430(31)|journal=GSA Special Papers |year=2007|volume=430|pages=669–691|isbn=978-0-8137-2430-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had several negative repercussions on the environment, including metal loading and excess atmospheric carbon. Metal loading, the release of toxic metals from volcanic eruptions into the environment, led to [[acid rain]] and general stress on the environment. These toxic metals are known to infringe on [[vascular plant]]s’ ability to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]], which may have resulted in the loss of Permian-era flora. Excess [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere is believed to be the main cause of the shrinking of lysocline areas.{{how?|date=November 2018}}

The third cause of this extinction event that can be attributed to northern Pangaea is the beginnings of anoxic ocean environments, or oceans with very low oxygen concentrations. The mix of [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] oceans and [[ocean acidification]] due to metal loading led to increasingly acidic oceans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.06.014|title=Permian lysocline shoaling and ocean acidification along NW Pangea led to carbonate eradication and chert expansion|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume=350–352|pages=73–90|year=2012|last1=Beauchamp|first1=Benoit|last2=Grasby|first2=Stephen E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ultimately led to the extinction of [[Benthos|benthic species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1130/B31197.1|title=Progressive environmental deterioration in northwestern Pangea leading to the latest Permian extinction|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|volume=127|issue=9–10|pages=1331–1347|year=2015|last1=Grasby|first1=Stephen E.|last2=Beauchamp|first2=Benoit|last3=Bond|first3=David P.G.|last4=Wignall|first4=Paul|last5=Talavera|first5=Cristina|last6=Galloway|first6=Jennifer M.|last7=Piepjohn|first7=Karsten|last8=Reinhardt|first8=Lutz|last9=Blomeier|first9=Dierk|bibcode=2015GSAB..127.1331G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], a '''paste''' is a substance that behaves as a [[solid]] until a sufficiently large load or [[stress (physics)|stress]] is applied, at which point it flows like a [[fluid]]. In [[rheology|rheological]] terms, a paste is an example of a [[Bingham plastic]] [[fluid]].

Pastes typically consist of a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] of [[granular material]] in a background fluid.  The individual grains are jammed together like [[sand]] on a [[beach]], forming a disordered, [[glass]]y or [[amorphous]] structure, and giving pastes their solid-like character.  It is this "jamming together" that gives pastes some of their most unusual properties; this causes paste to demonstrate properties of [[fragile matter]]. 

In pharmacology, '''paste''' is basic [[pharmaceutical form]]. It consists of fatty base (e.g., [[petroleum jelly]]) and at least 25% solid substance (e.g., [[zinc oxide]]).
Pastes are the semisolid preparations intended for external application to the skin. Usually they are thick and do not melt at normal temperature. Remain on the area for longer duration.

Examples include [[starch]] pastes, [[toothpaste]], [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]], and [[putty]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12585">The '''Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board report on mass surveillance''' was issued in January 2014 in light of the [[global surveillance disclosures of 2013]], recommending the US end bulk data collection.&lt;ref name="accessnow1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2014/01/23/us-privacy-oversight-board-slams-legality-usefulness-bulk-data-collection |title=US privacy oversight board slams legality &amp; usefulness bulk data collection |publisher=Accessnow.org |date=January 23, 2014 |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |author1=Micek, Peter |author2=Ben-Avie, Jochai |author3=Fox, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PCLOB /&gt;

==Background==
The [[Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board]] was first chartered under the [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title I - Reform of the Intelligence Community|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/108-796/titlei_reform_intel.pdf|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|accessdate=December 5, 2012|date=December 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of the board is to provide advice and review of whether adequate supervision, guidelines, and oversight exist and to "continually review" regulations, policies, procedures, and information sharing practices to ensure privacy and civil liberties considerations are protected.&lt;ref name="Hatch2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George|first=Roger Z.|author2=Robert D. Kline|title=Intelligence and the National Security Strategist|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2005|page=572|isbn=978-0-7425-4039-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To carry out these roles, the board does not have [[subpoena]] power, but is able to request subpoenas subject to the [[U.S. Attorney General]]'s discretion "to protect sensitive law enforcement or counterterrorism information or ongoing operations."  The [[U.S. Director of National Intelligence]] also has the power to override requests "to protect the national security interests of the United States"&lt;ref name="Hatch2011" /&gt;

A report by former members of the [[9/11 commission]] in December 2005 noted there was "little urgency" in creation of the board, whose first meeting was in 2006.&lt;ref name="Hatch2011" /&gt;  It was initially composed of a chair, vice chair, and three other members.  As these members served at the pleasure of the President, "Critics... maintained that the board appeared to be a presidential appendage, devoid of the capability to exercise independent judgment and assessment or to provide impartial findings and recommendations", according to the [[Congressional Research Service]].&lt;ref name="Hatch2011" /&gt;  Subsequently member Lanny Davis resigned in protest over the board's lack of independence, citing "extensive redlining by Administration officials of the board's first report to Congress" that was accepted by the other members.&lt;ref name=Hatch2011&gt;{{citation |title=Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board: New Independent Agency Status |author=Garrett Hatch |date=November 14, 2011 |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34385.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The board was then reconstituted under the [[Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007]] (H.R. 1), beginning in January 2008, as an independent agency with appointments subject to [[Senate confirmation]].  Four members of the board were nominated by President [[Barack Obama]] in 2011, and confirmed by the Senate in August 2012.&lt;ref name=Hatch2011 /&gt;  Board chairman David Medine was finally confirmed in May 2013 in the wake of the Snowden disclosures in a party-line vote with 53 Democrats supporting and 45 Republicans opposing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressivepunch.org/vote.htm?vote=2347201&amp;topic=R10|title = On the nomination of David Medine as chairman of the federal Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board: Senate Roll Call 114|publisher=ProgressivePunch|date=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global surveillance disclosures==
{{main|Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)}}
The Board's report follows a series of highly publicized leaks about the operations of the [[global surveillance]] program conducted by the [[National Security Agency]] in the United States working with a number of other countries (see [[Five Eyes]]).  While the program's nominal focus was on foreign nationals, the disclosures also revealed the large-scale surveillance of communications by United States citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Barton Gellman]]|title=Edward Snowden, after months of NSA revelations, says his mission’s accomplished|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/edward-snowden-after-months-of-nsa-revelations-says-his-missions-accomplished/2013/12/23/49fc36de-6c1c-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d_story.html|date=December 24, 2013|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These leaks were largely the work of [[Edward Snowden]], a [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] employee with access to a wide range of [[top secret]] documents.  Publications of the documents by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' began in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|title=NSA collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers daily|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order|work=The Guardian|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, 2014, the board released its report,&lt;ref name=PCLOB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1008957/final-report.pdf|title=Report on the Telephone Records Program Conducted under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and on the Operations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|publisher=Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommending the US end bulk data collection.&lt;ref name="accessnow1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Charlie|title=Watchdog Report Says N.S.A.

The report called for a "Special Advocate" to be involved in some cases before the FISA court judge.&lt;ref name="accessnow1"/&gt; The Board also contained the recommendation to release future and past FISC decisions “that involve novel interpretations of FISA or other significant questions of law, technology or compliance.”&lt;ref name="accessnow1"/&gt;

The report also recommended against an alternate proposal, which President [[Barack Obama]] had ordered Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] to formulate within 60 days, which would force third parties including telephone companies to conduct data retention.  The panel's majority spokesman said this was due to cost and legal exposure for the companies involved, and that it was not an "easy out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-01-23/nsa-phone-data-program-called-illegal-by-privacy-oversight-board|title=NSA’s Spying on Phone Calls Illegal: U.S. Privacy Board|publisher=Bloomsburg News|author=Margaret Talev and Chris Strohm|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PCLOB /&gt;

==Reactions==
Sen. [[Ron Wyden]], a senior member of the intelligence committee and long-time critic of the programs, released a statement in reaction to the report. Said Wyden: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The privacy board's findings closely mirror many of the criticisms made by surveillance reform advocates. The bulk collection program was built on a murky legal foundation that raises many constitutional questions and has been proven to be an ineffective tool for collecting unique intelligence information. Moreover, as the board wrote in its report, a program where the government collects the telephone records of millions of law-abiding Americans 'fundamentally shifts the balance of power between the state and its citizens.' The board goes on to say that with the government's 'powers of compulsion and criminal prosecution,' collection of data on its own citizens 'poses unique threats to privacy,' and is expected to have a 'chilling effect on the free exercise of speech and association.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Albany Tribune |url=http://www.albanytribune.com/23012014-wyden-statement-pclob-report-bulk-collection-phone-records/ |title=Wyden Statement On PCLOB Report On Bulk Collection Of Phone Records |publisher=Albanytribune.com |date=January 23, 2014 |accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Asked by [[Patrick Mächler]] to what extent the report will have an impact, [[Edward Snowden]] stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;I don’t see how Congress could ignore it, as it makes it clear there is no reason at all to maintain the 215 program. Let me quote from the official report:

“Cessation of the program would eliminate the privacy and civil liberties concerns associated with bulk collection without unduly hampering the government’s efforts, while ensuring that any governmental requests for telephone calling records are tailored to the needs of specific investigations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.freesnowden.is/asksnowden/ |title=Live Q&amp;A with Edward Snowden |last=Snowden |first=Edward |date=January 23, 2014 |publisher=Courage Foundation |accessdate=January 24, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124015739/http://www.freesnowden.is/asksnowden/ |archivedate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''RazakSAT''' is a [[Malaysia]]n [[Earth observation satellite]] carrying a high-resolution camera. It was launched into [[low Earth orbit]] on 14 July 2009.&lt;!-- Implicitly this is GMT--&gt; It was placed into a near-equatorial orbit that presents many imaging opportunities for the equatorial region. &lt;!-- claim was "unique" orbit. Please cite a ref for that assertion if it needs to be restored. --&gt;It weighs over three times a much as [[TiungSAT-1]] and carries a high resolution Earth observation camera. Developed in conjunction with Satrec Initiative, the satellite's low inclination orbit (9 degrees) brought it over Malaysia a dozen or more times per day. This was intended to provide greatly increased coverage of Malaysia, compared to most other Earth observation satellites.&lt;ref name="FALCON 1 FLIGHT 5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacex.com/F1-005.php|title=FALCON 1 FLIGHT 5|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104054341/http://www.spacex.com/F1-005.php|archivedate=2011-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An audit report released in October 2011 revealed that the satellite had failed after only 1 year of operation.&lt;ref name="themalaysianinsider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/rm142m-razaksat-faulty-after-just-one-year-says-federal-auditor/|title=RM142m RazakSAT faulty after just one year, says federal auditor - The Malaysian Insider|publisher=themalaysianinsider.com|accessdate=2014-09-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014203711/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/rm142m-razaksat-faulty-after-just-one-year-says-federal-auditor/|archivedate=2014-10-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RazakSAT was the first satellite to be put in orbit by a completely developed private liquid-fueled rocket: SpaceX's [[Falcon 1]] .

==Background==
This satellite is Malaysia's second [[remote sensing]] satellite after [[TiungSAT-1]].

Originally called MACSAT, RazakSAT's payload is mainly [[electro-optical]], carrying a Medium-sized Aperture Camera (MAC) which is a pushbroom camera with five linear detectors (one [[panchromatic]], four [[Multi-spectral image|multi-spectral]]) weighing approximately 50&amp;nbsp;kg. The entire satellite weighs at about 180&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="ASM2"&gt;

==Launch==
[[SpaceX]] launched RazakSAT at 03:35 UTC on 14 July 2009 using a [[Falcon 1]] rocket. This was the fifth flight of a Falcon 1, and like the previous flights lift-off was from [[Omelek Island]] in the Kwajalein Atoll. At 05:25 UTC [[Elon Musk]], founder and CEO of SpaceX, told a reporter the launch had been a success. "We nailed the orbit to well within target parameters...pretty much a bullseye." Musk said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/falcon/005/status.html |title=Falcon Launch Report |publisher=Spaceflight Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
RazakSAT's mission plan was carried out by engineers from [[Astronautic Technology Sdn Bhd|ATSB]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

This was especially important because Malaysia is usually covered by the equatorial cloud bands. Normal sun-synchronous optical satellites, which may re-visit an area only once every 7 days, will almost never be able to see the ground during their pass. As a result, much optical satellite imagery of Malaysia have more than 50% cloud cover within the image's footprint.

Razaksat, on the other hand, revisited some parts of Malaysian territory every 90 minutes, potentially maximising its ability to exploit gaps in the clouds.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

RazakSAT, equipped with a high resolution Medium-Sized Aperture Camera (MAC), achieved the intended Near-Equatorial Low Earth Orbit (NEqO) at 685&amp;nbsp;km altitude and a 9 degree inclination. It was expected to provide high resolution images of Malaysia that can be applied to land management, resource development and forestry.&lt;ref name="FALCON 1 FLIGHT 5"/&gt;

Be that as it may, the NEqO orbit does have 3 distinct disadvantages. Analysis through the commercially available [[Satellite Tool Kit]] (STK) software had shown that the orbit revisit over Malaysia was found to have a maximum peak of 2-4 overpasses per day during daylight hours (from 8&amp;nbsp;am to 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm) to a period of 6 consecutive days without any usable daylight overpasses. The second disadvantage is that most imagery acquired through the NEqO orbit are not usable through a remote sensing perspective as the NEqO orbit is not a [[sun-synchronous]] orbit, a vital criterion for monitoring and analysis work. Thirdly, it was found that the NEqO orbit exposes the satellite to the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]] (SAA) phenomenon on every orbit it takes around the earth unlike the [[polar orbit]], near-polar or [[sun-synchronous]] orbits, thereby further increasing the risk of radiation damage to the satellite.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Originally slated for commercial purposes in 2009,&lt;ref name="thestar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=nation&amp;file=/2009/3/22/nation/3534086|title=Archives &amp;#124; The Star Online.|publisher=thestar.com.my|accessdate=2014-09-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325052952/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2009%2F3%2F22%2Fnation%2F3534086&amp;sec=nation|archivedate=2009-03-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the aim of the RazakSAT project was then changed into a Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Project in 2010.&lt;ref name="themalaysianinsider"/&gt;

During its operations after its launch in 2009, it was discovered that the RazakSAT satellite could not achieve its targeted pointing accuracy of within 1&amp;nbsp;km of its intended target. The Malaysian English newspaper The Star, quoting from the Malaysian Government Auditor-General's Report 2010, reported that the images that were acquired by the RazakSAT satellite was found to be 37&amp;nbsp;km off their intended target.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/10/25/nation/9767688&amp;sec=nation "RM142mil satellite is 37km off target"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027110144/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F10%2F25%2Fnation%2F9767688&amp;sec=nation |date=2011-10-27 }} (The Star, Nation, page 4, 25 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the pointing error, all of the over 1,328 images acquired by the satellite were rendered unusable. Despite a promise of delivering MAC images by 2010, as of the end of 2011, the operators have not released any images. Efforts to fix the problems with the satellite were terminated in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/rm142m-razaksat-faulty-after-just-one-year-says-federal-auditor/ "RM142m RazakSAT faulty after just one year, says federal auditor"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014203711/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/rm142m-razaksat-faulty-after-just-one-year-says-federal-auditor/ |date=2014-10-14 }} dated 25 October 2011 (Shannon Teoh, Malaysian Insider, 25 October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of their unique properties, these materials are of great interest in many industrial areas including, but not limited to, [[abrasive]]s, polishing and [[Cutting tool (machining)|cutting tools]] and [[wear]]-resistant and protective coatings.

[[Diamond]] is the hardest known material to date, with a Vickers hardness in the range of 70–150 GPa. Diamond demonstrates both high [[thermal conductivity]] and [[Insulator (electrical)|electrically insulating]] properties and much attention has been put into finding practical applications of this material. However, diamond has several limitations for mass industrial application, including its high cost and oxidation at temperatures above 800&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/S0925-9635(01)00673-2| title=The oxidation of (100) textured diamond| date=2002| author=John, P| journal=Diamond and Related Materials| volume=11| pages=861| issue=3–6|bibcode = 2002DRM....11..861J | last2=Polwart| first2=N.| last3=Troupe| first3=C.E.| last4=Wilson| first4=J.I.B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/0022-0248(79)90052-6| title=The history and present status of synthetic diamond| date=1979| author=Nassau, K| journal=Journal of Crystal Growth| volume=46| pages=157| issue=2|bibcode = 1979JCrGr..46..157N | last2=Nassau| first2=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, diamond dissolves in [[iron]] and forms [[Cementite|iron carbides]] at high temperatures and therefore is inefficient in cutting ferrous materials including [[steel]]. Therefore, recent research of superhard materials has been focusing on compounds which would be thermally and chemically more stable than pure diamond.

Superhard materials can be generally classified into two categories: intrinsic compounds and extrinsic compounds. The intrinsic group includes [[diamond]], [[cubic boron nitride]] (c-BN), [[Beta carbon nitride|carbon nitrides]] and ternary compounds such as B-N-C, which possess an innate hardness. Conversely, extrinsic materials are those that have superhardness and other mechanical properties that are determined by their microstructure rather than composition.&lt;ref name= Veprek&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vepřek|first1=Stan|title=The search for novel, superhard materials|journal=[[Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology A]]|volume=17|pages=2401|date=1999|doi=10.1116/1.581977|issue=5|url=http://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/958917/document.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Levine&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine|first1=Jonathan B.|last2=Tolbert|first2=Sarah H.|last3=Kaner|first3=Richard B.|title=Advancements in the Search for Superhard Ultra-Incompressible Metal Borides|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|volume=19|pages=3519|date=2009|doi=10.1002/adfm.200901257|issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haines&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haines|first1=J|last2=Leger|first2=JM|last3=Bocquillon|first3=G|title=Synthesis and design of superhard materials|journal=Annual Review of Materials Research|volume=31|pages=1|date=2001|doi=10.1146/annurev.matsci.31.1.1|bibcode = 2001AnRMS..31....1H }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of extrinsic superhard material is nanocrystalline diamond known as [[aggregated diamond nanorod]]s.

==Definition and mechanics of hardness==
[[Image:Vickers-path-2.svg|thumb|Vickers test scheme]]
[[Image:Case hardened steel-vickers hardness test.png|thumb|An indentation left in case-hardened steel after a Vickers hardness test.]]
The hardness of a material is directly related to its incompressibility, elasticity and resistance to change in shape. A superhard material has high [[shear modulus]], high [[bulk modulus]] and does not deform [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically]]. Ideally superhard materials should have a defect-free, isotropic lattice. This greatly reduces structural deformations that can lower the strength of the material. However, defects can actually strengthen some covalent structures. Traditionally, high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions have been used to synthesize superhard materials, but recent superhard material syntheses aim at using less energy and lower cost materials.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haines/&gt;

Historically, hardness was first defined as the ability of one material to scratch another and quantified by an integer (sometimes half-integer) from 0 to 10 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. This scale was however quickly found too discrete and non-linear. Measuring the mechanical hardness of materials changed to using a [[nanoindenter]] (usually made of diamond) and evaluating bulk moduli, and the [[Brinell scale|Brinell]], [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell]], [[Knoop hardness test|Knoop]] and [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers]] scales have been developed. Whereas the Vickers scale is widely accepted as a most common test,&lt;ref name=Haines/&gt; there remain controversies on the weight load to be applied during the test. Bulk moduli, shear moduli, and elasticity are the key factors in the superhard classification process.

The incompressibility of a material is quantified by the bulk modulus B, which measures the resistance of a solid to volume compression under [[hydrostatic stress]] as B = −Vdp/dV. Here V is the volume, p is pressure, and dp/dV is the partial derivative of pressure with respect to the volume. The bulk modulus test uses an indenter tool to form a permanent deformation in a material. The size of the deformation depends on the material’s resistance to the volume compression made by the tool. Elements with small molar volumes and strong interatomic forces usually have high bulk moduli. Bulk moduli was the first major test of hardness and originally shown to be correlated with the molar volume (V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) and cohesive energy (E&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) as B ~ E&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; Bulk modulus was believed to be a direct measure of a material’s hardness but this no longer remains the dominant school of thought. For example, some [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[noble metal]]s (Pd, Ag) have anomalously high ratio of the bulk modulus to the Vickers of Brinell hardness. In the early 2000s, a direct relationship between bulk modulus and valence electron density was found as the more electrons were present the greater the repulsions within the structure were.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt; Bulk modulus is still used as a preliminary measure of a material as superhard but it is now known that other properties must be taken into account.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haines/&gt;

In contrast to bulk modulus, shear modulus measures the resistance to shape change at a constant volume, taking into account the crystalline plane and direction of shear. The shear modulus G is defined as ratio of shear stress to shear strain: G = stress/strain = F·L/(A·dx), where F is the applied force, A is the area upon which the force acts, dx is the resulting displacement and L is the initial length. The larger the shear modulus, the greater the ability for a material to resist shearing forces. Therefore, the shear modulus is a measure of rigidity. Shear modulus is related to bulk modulus as {{nowrap|3/G {{=}} 2B(1 − 2v)(1 + v)}}, where v is the Poisson’s ratio, which is typically ~0.1 in covalent materials. If a material contains highly directional bonds, the shear modulus will increase and give a low Poisson ratio.

A material is also considered hard if it resists plastic deformation. If a material has short covalent bonds, atomic dislocations that lead to plastic deformation are less likely to occur than in materials with longer, delocalized bonds. If a material contains many delocalized bonds it is likely to be soft.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt; Somewhat related to hardness is another mechanical property [[fracture toughness]], which is a material's ability to resist breakage from forceful impact (note that this concept is distinct from the notion of [[toughness]]). A superhard material is not necessarily "supertough". For example, the fracture toughness of diamond is about 7–10 [[Megapascal|MPa]]·m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;

Several properties must be taken into account when evaluating a material as (super)hard. While hard materials have high bulk moduli, a high bulk modulus does not mean a material is hard. Inelastic characteristics must be considered as well, and shear modulus might even provide a better correlation with hardness than bulk modulus. Covalent materials generally have high bond-bending force constants and high shear moduli and are more likely to give superhard structures than, for example, ionic solids.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haines/&gt;

==Diamond==
[[File:Diamond and graphite2.jpg|thumb|left|Diamond and graphite materials and structure]]
[[Diamond]] is an allotrope of carbon where the atoms are arranged in a modified version of [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (''fcc'') structure known as "[[diamond cubic]]". It is known for its hardness (see table above) and incompressibility and is targeted for some potential optical and electrical applications. The properties of individual natural diamonds or [[carbonado]] vary too widely for industrial purposes, and therefore [[synthetic diamond]] became a major research focus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wei|first1=Lanhua|last2=Kuo|first2=P.|last3=Thomas|first3=R.|last4=Anthony|first4=T.|last5=Banholzer|first5=W.|title=Thermal conductivity of isotopically modified single crystal diamond|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=70|issue=24|pages=3764–3767|date=1993|pmid=10053956|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.3764|bibcode=1993PhRvL..70.3764W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=J|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|volume=42|pages=1605|date=1979|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/42/10/001|title=Optical absorption and luminescence in diamond|issue=10|bibcode=1979RPPh...42.1605W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The synthesis clearly showed the potential of high-pressure applications for industrial purposes and stimulated growing interest in the field. Four years after the first synthesis of artificial diamond, cubic [[boron nitride]] c-BN was obtained and found to be the second hardest solid.&lt;ref name="Wentorf"/&gt;

[[Synthetic diamond]] can exist as a single, continuous crystal or as small polycrystals interconnected through the grain boundaries. The inherent spatial separation of these subunits causes the formation of grains, which are visible by the unaided eye due to the light absorption and scattering properties of the material.&lt;ref name=Nature1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lonsdale|first1=Kathleen|title=Further Comments on Attempts by H. Moissan, J. B.

The hardness of synthetic diamond (70–150 GPa) is very dependent on the relative purity of the crystal itself. The more perfect the crystal structure, the harder the diamond becomes. It has recently been reported that HPHT single crystals and nanocrystalline diamond aggregates ([[aggregated diamond nanorod]]s) can be harder than natural diamond.&lt;ref name=Nature1/&gt;

Historically, it was thought that synthetic diamond should be structurally perfect to be useful. This is because diamond was mainly preferred for its aesthetic qualities, and small flaws in structure and composition were visible by naked eye. Although this is true, the properties associated with these small changes has led to interesting new potential applications of synthetic diamond. For example, nitrogen doping can enhance mechanical strength of diamond,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Catledge|first1=Shane A.|last2=Vohra|first2=Yogesh K.|title=Effect of nitrogen addition on the microstructure and mechanical properties of diamond films grown using high-methane concentrations|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=86|pages=698|date=1999|doi=10.1063/1.370787|bibcode = 1999JAP....86..698C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and heavy doping with [[boron]] (several atomic percent) makes it a [[Covalent superconductor|superconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ekimov|first1=E.

==Cubic boron nitride==

===History===
[[Boron nitride#Cubic boron nitride|Cubic boron nitride]] or c-BN was first synthesized in 1957 by Robert H. Wentorf at General Electric, shortly after the synthesis of diamond.&lt;ref name=Wentorf&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wentorf|first1=R. H.|title=Cubic Form of Boron Nitride|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=26|pages=956|date=1957|doi=10.1063/1.1745964|issue=4|bibcode=1957JChPh..26..956W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general process for c-BN synthesis is the dissolution of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in a solvent-catalyst, usually alkali or [[alkaline earth metal]]s or their [[nitride]]s, followed by spontaneous nucleation of c-BN under high pressure, high temperature (HPHT) conditions.&lt;ref name=Haines/&gt; The yield of c-BN is lower and substantially slower compared to diamond's synthetic route due to the complicated intermediate steps. Its insolubility in iron and other metal alloys makes it more useful for some industrial applications than diamond.&lt;ref name=bn1&gt;{{cite book| author = Greim, Jochen | author2 = Schwetz, Karl A. |title = Boron Carbide, Boron Nitride, and Metal Borides, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher = Wiley-VCH: Weinheim |date = 2005 |doi = 10.1002/14356007.a04_295.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boron-nitride-(sphalerite)-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|Sphalerite BN structure]]
Pure cubic boron nitride is transparent or slightly amber. Different colors can be produced depending on defects or an excess of boron (less than 1%).&lt;ref name=Haines/&gt; Defects can be produced by doping solvent-catalysts (i.e. Li, Ca, or Mg nitrides) with Al, B, Ti, or Si. This induces a change in the morphology and color of c-BN crystals.&lt;ref name= Bocquillon&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bocquillon|first1=G.|last2=Loriers-Susse|first2=C.|last3=Loriers|first3=J.|title=Synthesis of cubic boron nitride using Mg and pure or M'-doped Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N, Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with M'=Al, B, Si, Ti|journal=Journal of Materials Science|volume=28|pages=3547|date=1993|doi=10.1007/BF01159836|issue=13|bibcode = 1993JMatS..28.3547B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The result is darker and larger (500 μm) crystals with better shapes and a higher yield.

===Structure and properties===
Cubic boron nitride adopts a [[Cubic crystal system#Zincblende structure|sphalerite crystal structure]], which can be constructed by replacing every two carbon atoms in diamond with one boron atom and one nitrogen atom. The short B-N (1.57 Å) bond is close to the diamond C-C bond length (1.54 Å), that results in strong covalent bonding between atoms in the same fashion as in diamond. The slight decrease in covalency for B-N bonds compared to C-C bonds reduces the hardness from ~100 GPa for diamond down to 48 GPa in c-BN. As diamond is less stable than graphite, c-BN is less stable than h-BN, but the conversion rate between those forms is negligible at room temperature.&lt;ref name=bn1/&gt;

Cubic boron nitride is insoluble in iron, nickel, and related alloys at high temperatures, but it binds well with metals due to formation of interlayers of metal borides and nitrides. It is also insoluble in most acids, but is soluble in alkaline molten salts and nitrides, such as LiOH, KOH, NaOH/Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; which are used to etch c-BN.&lt;ref name=bn2&gt;{{cite book| title = Landolt-Börnstein – Group VIII Advanced Materials and Technologies: Powder Metallurgy Data. Refractory, Hard and Intermetallic Materials| chapter = 13.5 Properties of diamond and cubic boron nitride|volume = 2A2| doi = 10.1007/b83029| isbn = 978-3-540-42961-6| pages = 118–139| editor= Beiss, P. |author= Leichtfried, G. | date = 2002| publisher = Springer| location = Berlin| displayauthors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its stability with heat and metals, c-BN surpasses diamond in mechanical applications. The thermal conductivity of BN is among the highest of all electric insulators. In addition, c-BN consists of only light elements and has low X-ray absorptivity, capable of reducing the X-ray absorption background.&lt;ref name=Khakani&gt;{{cite journal|last1=El Khakani|first1=M. A.|title=Physical properties of the x-ray membrane materials|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B|volume=11|pages=2930|date=1993|doi=10.1116/1.586563|issue=6|bibcode = 1993JVSTB..11.2930E |last2=Chaker|first2=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research and development===
Due to its great chemical and mechanical robustness, c-BN has widespread application as an abrasive, such as on cutting tools and scratch resistant surfaces. Cubic boron nitride is also highly transparent to X-rays. This, along with its high strength, makes it possible to have very thin coatings of c-BN on structures that can be inspected using X-rays. Several hundred [[tonne]]s of c-BN are produced worldwide each year.&lt;ref name=Wilke&gt;Wilke, K.T. and Bohm, J. (1988) ''Kristallzüchtung'', [[Verlag Harri Deutsch]], Frankfurt.&lt;/ref&gt; By modification, Borazon, a US brand name of c-BN, is used in industrial applications to shape tools, as it can withstand temperatures greater than 2,000&amp;nbsp;°C. Cubic boron nitride-coated grinding wheels, referred to as Borazon wheels, are routinely used in the machining of hard ferrous metals, cast irons, and nickel-base and cobalt-base [[superalloys]]. Other brand names, such as Elbor and Cubonite, are marketed by Russian vendors.&lt;ref name=bn1/&gt;

New approaches in research focus on improving c-BN pressure capabilities of the devices used for c-BN synthesis.&lt;ref name=Haines/&gt; At present, the capabilities for the production of c-BN are restricted to pressures of about 6 GPa. Increasing the pressure limit will permit synthesis of larger single crystals than from the present catalytic synthesis. However, the use of solvents under supercritical conditions for c-BN synthesis has been shown to reduce pressure requirements.&lt;ref name=Haines/&gt; The high cost of c-BN still limits its application, which motivates the search for other superhard materials.

==Carbon nitride==
The structure of [[beta carbon nitride]] (β-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) was first proposed by [[Marvin Cohen]] and Amy Liu in 1989. It is [[isostructural]] with Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and was predicted to be harder than diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=A. Y.|last2=Cohen|first2=M. L.|title=Prediction of New Low Compressibility Solids|journal=Science|volume=245|issue=4920|pages=841–2|date=1989|pmid=17773359|doi=10.1126/science.245.4920.841|bibcode = 1989Sci...245..841L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculated bond length was 1.47 Å, 5% shorter than the C-C bond length in diamond. Later calculations indicated that the shear modulus is 60% of that of diamond, and carbon nitride is less hard than c-BN.&lt;ref name= Teter&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teter|first1=D. M.|last2=Hemley|first2=R. J.|title=Low-Compressibility Carbon Nitrides|journal=Science|volume=271|pages=53|date=1996|doi=10.1126/science.271.5245.53|issue=5245|bibcode = 1996Sci...271...53T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite two decades of pursuit of this compound, no synthetic sample of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has validated the hardness predictions; this has been attributed to the difficulty in synthesis and the instability of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Carbon nitride is only stable at a pressure that is higher than that of the graphite-to-diamond transformation. The synthesis conditions would require extremely high pressures because carbon is four- and sixfold coordinated.&lt;ref name=Haines/&gt; In addition, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; would pose problems of carbide formation if they were to be used to machine ferrous metals. Although publications have reported preparation of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at lower pressures than stated, synthetic C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was not proved superhard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yin|first1=Long-Wei|last2=Li|first2=Mu-Sen|last3=Liu|first3=Yu-Xian|last4=Sui|first4=Jin-Ling|last5=Wang|first5=Jing-Min|title=Synthesis of beta carbon nitride nanosized crystal through mechanochemical reaction|journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter|volume=15|pages=309|date=2003|doi=10.1088/0953-8984/15/2/330|issue=2|bibcode = 2003JPCM...15..309Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boron carbon nitride==
The similar atomic sizes of boron, carbon and nitrogen, as well as the similar structures of carbon and boron nitride polymorphs, suggest that it might be possible to synthesize diamond-like phase containing all three elements. It is also possible to make compounds containing B-C-O, B-O-N, or B-C-O-N under high pressure, but their synthesis would expect to require a complex chemistry and in addition, their elastic properties would be inferior to that of diamond.

Beginning in 1990, a great interest has been put in studying the possibility to synthesize dense B-C-N phases. They are expected to be thermally and chemically more stable than diamond, and harder than c-BN, and would therefore be excellent materials for high speed cutting and polishing of ferrous alloys. These characteristic properties are attributed to the diamond-like structure combined with the sp3 σ-bonds among carbon and the heteroatoms. BC&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; thin films were synthesized by [[chemical vapor deposition]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Badzian, R.; Niemyski, T. and Olkusnik, E. (1972) in ''Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Chemical Vapor Deposition'', Salt Lake City, April 1972, F. A. Galski (ed.), p. 747&lt;/ref&gt; However, data on the attempted synthesis of B-C-N dense phases reported by different authors have been contradictory. It is unclear whether the synthesis products are diamond-like solid solutions between carbon and boron nitride or just mechanical mixtures of highly dispersed diamond and c-BN. In 2001, a diamond-like-structured c-BC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N was synthesized at pressures &gt;18 GPa and temperatures &gt;2,200 K by a direct solid-state phase transition of graphite-like (BN)&lt;sub&gt;0.48&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;0.52&lt;/sub&gt;. The reported Vickers and Knoop hardnesses were intermediate between diamond and c-BN, making the new phase the second hardest known material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Solozhenko|first1=Vladimir L.|last2=Andrault|first2=Denis|last3=Fiquet|first3=Guillaume|last4=Mezouar|first4=Mohamed|last5=Rubie|first5=David C.|title=Synthesis of superhard cubic BC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=78|pages=1385|date=2001|doi=10.1063/1.1337623|issue=10|bibcode = 2001ApPhL..78.1385S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ternary B–C–N phases can also be made using shock-compression synthesis. It was further suggested to extend the B–C–N system to quaternary compounds with silicon included.&lt;ref name=Veprek/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Solozhenko|first1=V|last2=Gregoryanz|first2=E|title=Synthesis of superhard materials|journal=Materials Today|volume=8|pages=44|date=2005|doi=10.1016/S1369-7021(05)71159-7|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metal borides==
Unlike carbon-based systems, metal borides can be easily synthesized in large quantities under ambient conditions, an important technological advantage.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt; Most metal borides are hard; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Akopov |first1=Georgiy |last2=Yeung |first2=Michael T. |last3=Kaner |first3=Richard B. |title=Rediscovering the Crystal Chemistry of Borides |journal=Advanced Materials |date=June 2017 |volume=29 |issue=21 |pages=1604506 |doi=10.1002/adma.201604506}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, a few stand out among them for their particularly high hardnesses (for example, WB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1102636108|pmid=21690363| title = Tungsten tetraboride, an inexpensive superhard material| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 108| issue = 27| pages = 10958–62| year = 2011| last1 = Mohammadi | first1 = R.| last2 = Lech | first2 = A.

These metal borides are still metals and not semiconductors or insulators (as indicated by their high electronic [[density of states]] at the [[Fermi Level]]); however, the additional covalent B-B and M-B bonding (M = metal) lead to high hardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=Paul J. |last2=Liu |first2=Gaoxiang |last3=Ciborowski |first3=Sandra |last4=Martinez-Martinez |first4=Chalynette |last5=Chamorro |first5=Juan R. |last6=Zhang |first6=Xinxing |last7=McQueen |first7=Tyrel M. |last8=Bowen |first8=Kit H. |last9=Alexandrova |first9=Anastassia N. |title=Mystery of Three Borides: Differential Metal–Boron Bonding Governing Superhard Structures |journal=Chemistry of Materials |date=16 November 2017 |volume=29 |issue=23 |pages=9892–9896 |doi=10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b04378}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Cumberland&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cumberland|first1=Robert W.|last2=Weinberger|first2=Michelle B.|last3=Gilman|first3=John J.|last4=Clark|first4=Simon M.|last5=Tolbert|first5=Sarah H.|last6=Kaner|first6=Richard B.|title=Osmium Diboride, An Ultra-Incompressible, Hard Material|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=127|issue=20|pages=7264–5|date=2005|pmid=15898746|doi=10.1021/ja043806y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dense [[heavy metals]], such as [[osmium]], [[rhenium]], [[tungsten]] etc., are particularly apt at forming hard borides because of their high electron densities, small atomic radii, high bulk moduli, and ability to bond strongly with boron.

===Osmium diboride===
[[File:OsB2 Structure.png|thumb|Crystal structure of OsB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
[[Osmium borides|Osmium diboride]] (OsB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has a high bulk modulus of 395 GPa and therefore is considered as a candidate superhard material, but the maximum achieved Vickers hardness is 37 GPa, slightly below the 40 GPa limit of superhardness. A common way to synthesize OsB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is by a solid-state [[metathesis reaction]] containing a 2:3 mixture of OsCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:[[Magnesium diboride|MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt; After the [[Magnesium chloride|MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] product is washed away, [[X-ray diffraction]] indicates products of OsB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, OsB and Os. Heating this product at 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C for three days produces pure OsB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystalline product. OsB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has an [[Orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic structure]] ([[space group]] P''mmn'') with two planes of osmium atoms separated by a non-planar layer of hexagonally coordinated boron atoms; the lattice parameters are ''a'' = 4.684 Å, ''b'' = 2.872 Å and ''c'' = 4.096 Å.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt; The ''b'' direction of the crystal is the most compressible and the ''c'' direction is the least compressible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Z.|last2=Xiang|first2=H.|last3=Yang|first3=Jinlong|last4=Hou|first4=J.|last5=Zhu|first5=Qingshi|title=Structural and electronic properties of OsB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: A hard metallic material|journal=Physical Review B|volume=74|date=2006|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.74.012102|arxiv = cond-mat/0508506 |bibcode = 2006PhRvB..74a2102C |pages=12102}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be explained by the orthorhombic structure. When looking at the boron and osmium atoms in the ''a'' and ''b'' directions, they are arranged in a way that is offset from one another. Therefore, when they are compressed they are not pushed right up against one another. Electrostatic repulsion is the force that maximizes the materials incompressibility and so in this case the electrostatic repulsion is not taken full advantage of. When compressed in the ''c'' direction, the osmium and boron atoms are almost directly in line with one another and the electrostatic repulsion is therefore high, causing direction ''c'' to be the least compressible. This model implies that if boron is more evenly distributed throughout the lattice then incompressibility could be higher. [[Electron backscatter diffraction]] coupled with hardness measurements reveals that in the (010) plane, the crystal is 54% harder in the [[Miller index#Case of cubic structures|&lt;100&gt;]] than &lt;001&gt; direction. This is seen by looking at how long the indentation is along a certain direction (related to the indentations made with a Vickers hardness test). Along with the alignment of the atoms, this is also due to the short covalent B-B (1.80 Å) bonds in the &lt;100&gt; direction, which are absent in the &lt;001&gt; direction (B-B = 4.10 Å).&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt;

===Rhenium borides===
Rhenium was targeted as a candidate for superhard metal borides because of its desirable physical and chemical characteristics. It has a high electron density, a small atomic radius and a high bulk modulus. When combined with boron, it makes a crystal with highly covalent bonding allowing it to be incompressible and potentially very hard.&lt;ref name=Inorg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gou|first1=Huiyang|last2=Wang|first2=Zhibin|last3=Zhang|first3=Jingwu|last4=Yan|first4=Shuting|last5=Gao|first5=Faming|title=Structural Stability and Elastic and Electronic Properties of Rhenium Borides: First Principle Investigations|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=48|issue=2|pages=581–7|date=2009|pmid=19072687|doi=10.1021/ic8019606}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide array of rhenium borides have been investigated including Re&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B, Re&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B, ReB, Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Re&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, ReB&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Each of these materials has their own set of properties and characteristics. Some show promise as superconductors and some have unique elastic and electronic properties, but the most relevant to superhard materials is ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Inorg/&gt;

[[Rhenium diboride]] (ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a refractory compound which was first synthesized in the 1960s, using [[Electric arc furnace|arc melting]], [[zone melting]], or optical floating zone furnaces. An example synthesis of this material is the flux method, which is conducted by placing rhenium metal and amorphous boron in an [[alumina]] crucible with excess aluminium. This can be run with a ratio of 1:2:50 for Re:B:Al, with the excess aluminum as a growth medium. The crucible is placed in an alumina tube, inserted into a resistively heated furnace with flowing [[argon]] gas and [[sintering|sintered]] at 1,400&amp;nbsp;°C for several hours. After cooling, the aluminium is dissolved in NaOH. Each ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis route has its own drawbacks, and this one gives small inclusions of aluminum incorporated into the crystal lattice.&lt;ref name=Jam/&gt;

Rhenium diboride has a very high melting point approaching 2,400&amp;nbsp;°C and a highly anisotropic, layered crystal structure.&lt;ref name=Jam&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine|first1=Jonathan B.|last2=Nguyen|first2=Sandy L.|last3=Rasool|first3=Haider I.|last4=Wright|first4=Jeffrey A.|last5=Brown|first5=Stuart E.|last6=Kaner|first6=Richard B.|title=Preparation and Properties of Metallic, Superhard Rhenium Diboride Crystals|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=130|issue=50|pages=16953–8|date=2008|pmid=19053446|doi=10.1021/ja804989q}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its symmetry is either hexagonal (space group P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''mc'') or orthorhombic (C''mcm'') depending on the phase. There, close-packed Re layers alternate with puckered triangular boron layers along the (001) plane. This can be seen above on the example of osmium diboride. The density of states for ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has one of the lowest values among the metal borides, indicating strong covalent bonding and high hardness.&lt;ref name=Inorg/&gt;

Owing to the anisotropic nature of this material, the hardness depends on the crystal orientation. The (002) plane contains the most covalent character and exhibits a maximum Vickers hardness value of 40.5 GPa, while the perpendicular planes were 6% lower at 38.1 GPa. These values decrease with increased load, settling at around 28 GPa each. The [[nanoindentation]] values were found to be 36.4 GPa and 34.0 GPa for the (002) and perpendicular planes respectively. The hardness values depend on the material purity and composition – the more boron the harder the boride – and the above values are for a Re:B ratio of approximately 1.00:1.85. Rhenium diboride also has a reported bulk modulus of 383 GPa and a shear modulus of 273 GPa.&lt;ref name=Jam/&gt;&lt;ref name=Acta&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine|doi=10.1016/j.actamat.2009.10.060|first1=J.B.|date=2010|pages=1530|volume=58|last2=Betts|journal=Acta Materialia|first2=J.B.|last3=Garrett|first3=J.D.|last4=Guo|first4=S.Q.|last5=Eng|first5=J.T.|last6=Migliori|first6=A.|last7=Kaner|first7=R.B.|title=Full elastic tensor of a crystal of the superhard compound ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardness of rhenium diboride, and most other materials also depends on the load during the test. The above values of about 40 GPa were all measured with an effective load of 0.5–1 N. At such low load, the hardness values are also overestimated for other materials, for example it exceeds 100 GPa for c-BN.&lt;ref name=d1/&gt; Other researchers, while having reproduced the high ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hardness at low load, reported much lower values of 19–17 GPa at a more conventional load of 3–49 N, that makes ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a hard, but not a superhard material.&lt;ref name=d1/&gt;&lt;ref name=advmat&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qin|first1=Jiaqian|last2=He|first2=Duanwei|last3=Wang|first3=Jianghua|last4=Fang|first4=Leiming|last5=Lei|first5=Li|last6=Li|first6=Yongjun|last7=Hu|first7=Juan|last8=Kou|first8=Zili|last9=Bi|first9=Yan|title=Is Rhenium Diboride a Superhard Material?|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=20|pages=4780|date=2008|doi=10.1002/adma.200801471|issue=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=qin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gu|first1=Qinfen|last2=Krauss|first2=Guenter|last3=Steurer|first3=Walter|title=ChemInform Abstract: Transition Metal Borides: Superhard versus Ultra-Incompressible|journal=ChemInform|volume=39|date=2008|doi=10.1002/chin.200850007|issue=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhenium diboride exhibits metallic conductivity which increases as temperature decreases and can be explained by a nonzero density of states due to the d and p overlap of rhenium and boron respectively. At this point, it is the only superhard material with metallic behavior. The material also exhibits relatively high thermal stability. Depending on the heating method, it will maintain its mass up to temperatures of 600–800&amp;nbsp;°C, with any drop being due to loss of absorbed water. A small loss of mass can then be seen at temperatures approaching 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C. It performs better when a slower heat ramp is utilized. Part of this small drop at around 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C was explained by the formation of a dull B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coating on the surface as boron is leached out of the solid, which serves as a protective coating, thereby reducing additional boron loss. This can be easily dissolved by methanol to restore the material to it native shiny state.&lt;ref name=Jam/&gt;&lt;ref name=Acta/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Šimůnek, A|title=Anisotropy of hardness from first principles: The cases of ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and OsB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Physical Review B|volume=80|date=2009|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.80.060103|issue=6|bibcode = 2009PhRvB..80f0103S |pages=60103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aluminum Magnesium Boride===
[[Aluminum magnesium boride]] or '''BAM''' is a [[chemical compound]] of [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]] and [[boron]]. Whereas its nominal formula is AlMgB&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;, the chemical composition is closer to Al&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a [[ceramic]] [[alloy]] that is highly resistive to wear and has a low coefficient of sliding friction.

Other hard boron-rich compounds include B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C and B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O. Amorphous a-B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C has a hardness of about 50 GPa, which is in the range of superhardness.&lt;ref name=Ulrich2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ulrich|first1=S|title=Subplantation effect in magnetron sputtered superhard boron carbide thin films|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=7|pages=835|date=1998|doi=10.1016/S0925-9635(97)00306-3|issue=6|bibcode = 1998DRM.....7..835U |last2=Ehrhardt|first2=H.|last3=Schwan|first3=J.|last4=Samlenski|first4=R.|last5=Brenn|first5=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be looked at as consisting of boron icosahedra-like crystals embedded in an amorphous medium. However, when studying the crystalline form of B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C, the hardness is only about 30 GPa. This crystalline form has the same stoichiometry as B&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which consists of boron icosahedra connected by boron and carbon atoms.&lt;ref name=Ulrich2/&gt; Boron suboxide (B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O) has a hardness of about 35 GPa. Its structure contains eight B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; icosahedra units, which are sitting at the vertices of a rhombohedral unit cell. There are two oxygen atoms located along the (111) rhombohedral direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubert|first1=Hervé|last2=Garvie|first2=Laurence A.

==Nanostructured superhard materials==
Nanosuperhard materials fall into the extrinsic category of superhard materials. Because molecular defects affect the superhard properties of bulk materials it is obvious that the microstructure of superhard materials give the materials their unique properties. Focus on synthesizing nano superhard materials is around minimizing microcracks occurring within the structure through grain boundary hardening. The elimination of microcracks can strengthen the material by 3 to 7 times its original strength. [[Grain boundary strengthening]] is described by the [[Grain boundary strengthening#Hall–Petch relationship|Hall-Petch]] equation&lt;ref name=crack&gt;Bouchaud, Elisabeth; Jeulin, Dominique and Prioul, Claude (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=uRijGxzu16sC&amp;pg=PA23 ''Physical aspects of fracture'']. Springer. {{ISBN|0-7923-7147-X}}. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_c = \sigma_0 + \frac{k_\text{gb}}{\sqrt{d}}&lt;/math&gt;

Here σ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical fracture stress, d the crystallite size and σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;gb&lt;/sub&gt; are constants.

If a material is brittle its strength depends mainly on the resistance to forming microcracks. The critical stress which causes the growth of a microcrack of size a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is given by a general formula&lt;ref name=crack/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_c = k_\text{crack} \sqrt{\frac{2E\gamma_s}{\pi a_0}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}&lt;/math&gt;

Here E is the [[Young's modulus]], k&lt;sub&gt;crack&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant dependent on the nature and shape of the microcrack and the stress applied and γ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; the surface cohesive energy.

The average hardness of a material decreases with d (crystallite size) decreasing below 10&amp;nbsp;nm. There have been many mechanisms proposed for [[grain boundary sliding]] and hence material softening, but the details are still not understood. Besides grain boundary strengthening, much attention has been put into building [[Heterostructure#Nanoscale heterojunctions|microheterostructures]], or nanostructures of two materials with very large differences in elastic moduli. Heterostructures were first proposed in 1970 and contained such highly ordered thin layers that they could not theoretically be separated by mechanical means. These highly ordered heterostructures were believed to be stronger than simple mixtures. This theory was confirmed with Al/Cu and Al/Ag structures. After the formation of Al/Cu and Al/Ag, the research was extended to multilayer systems including Cu/Ni, TiN/VN, W/WN, Hf/HfN and more. In all cases, decreasing the lattice period increased the hardness.&lt;ref name= Veprek/&gt; One common form of a nanostructured material is [[aggregated diamond nanorod]]s, which is harder than bulk diamond and is currently the hardest (~150 GPa) material known.&lt;ref name=blank&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blank |first1=V |title=Ultrahard and superhard phases of fullerite C60: Comparison with diamond on hardness and wear |url=http://nanoscan.info/wp-content/publications/article_03.pdf |journal=Diamond and Related Materials |volume=7 |pages=427 |date=1998 |doi=10.1016/S0925-9635(97)00232-X |issue=2–5 |bibcode=1998DRM.....7..427B |last2=Popov |first2=M. |last3=Pivovarov |first3=G. |last4=Lvova |first4=N. |last5=Gogolinsky |first5=K. |last6=Reshetov |first6=V. |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721225258/http://nanoscan.info/wp-content/publications/article_03.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6448">[[File:Koppen World Map Af.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Worldwide zones of Tropical rainforest climate (Af).]]A '''tropical rainforest climate''' is a [[tropical climate]] usually found within 10 to 15 degrees latitude of the [[equator]], and has at least 60 mm (2.4 inches) of rainfall every month of the year. Regions with this climate are typically designated ''Af'' by the [[Köppen climate classification]]. A tropical rainforest climate is typically hot and wet. 

==Description==
Tropical rainforests have a type of [[tropical climate]] in which there is no [[dry season]]&amp;mdash;all months have an average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] value of at least {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}}. In rainforest climates the dry season is very short, and rainfall is normally heavy throughout the year. One day in an equatorial climate can be very similar to the next, while the change in temperature between day and night may be larger than the average change in temperature during the year. &lt;ref name=McKnight&gt;{{Cite book

==Distribution==
[[File:Rainbow Jungle.jpg|thumb|upright=2.25|right|Upland rainforest in Borneo. Sabah, Malaysia]] A tropical rainforest climate is usually found at [[latitude]]s within 15 degrees North and South of the [[equator]], which are dominated by the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]]. The climate is most commonly found in [[South America]], [[Central Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. These rainforests are uniformly and monotonously wet throughout the year. Locations in [[South Pacific]]{{dn|date=December 2018}}&lt;!--not much land in the ocean, and even fewer rainforests--&gt;, areas along the  coast of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], from [[Ecuador]] to [[Belize]], parts of [[Central Africa]], and much of [[Indonesia]] have this type of climate.

==Centres of worship==
Inscribed stones dedicated to Viridios have been recovered in [[Ancaster Roman Town|Ancaster]], in Lincolnshire, England. &lt;ref&gt;Roman Britain, Cavsennae / Cavsennis. Romano-British Town, Ancaster, Lincolnshire. http://roman-britain.co.uk/places/ancaser.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  So far, Ancaster is the only place where inscriptions to this god have been found. 

==The Ancaster inscriptions==
The first inscribed stone was discovered in 1961 in a grave in Ancaster.  R.P. Wright &lt;ref&gt;Wright, R. (1962). Roman Britain in 1961: I. Sites Explored: II. Inscriptions. The Journal of Roman Studies, 52, page 192. doi:10.2307/297888&lt;/ref&gt; reports the find thus: 
 Ancaster (Causennae), Lincs (pl. XXVII, 2). Limestone slab, 271 by 12 in., 
 found in 1961 in digging a grave in the new cemetery on the west side of 
 the Roman W ditch (see above, p.167). The stone had been re-used to form 
 a medieval grave-cover, and in this process the lower moulding and part of 
 1. 3 had been trimmed off, and on the back the upper and lower edges had been 
 chamfered. As the height of the letters in 1. 2 is 34 in. and substantially 
 exceeds the height of 2-1 in. of 1. i, it seems likely that the text is complete; 
 it reads:
 '''DEO VIRIDIO'''
 '''TRENICO ARCVM'''
 '''FECITDESVODON'''
 If the text is complete Trenico must be the dedicator and subject of fecit and 
 don(avit). The god Viridios is unmatched.

The Latin inscription may be translated in English as: ''For the god Viridius, Trenico made this arch, donated from his own funds''.


[[File:Time Team Stone Inscription.jpg|thumb|The Time Team stone found in 2001]]
A second inscribed stone was discovered in 2001 by British Channel 4 Television's archaeological programme ''[[Time Team]]''. &lt;ref&gt;Time Team. ''The Roman's Panic''. Season 09, Episode 02. Originally aired on 13 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  The stone was discovered as part of a late Roman or early Sub-Roman ''[[cist]]'' burial, being used as a slab in the grave. &lt;ref&gt;Lincolnshire County Council. ''Lincs to the Past''. https://www.lincstothepast.com/Romano-British-Cemetery--Ancaster/1403642.record?pt=S&lt;/ref&gt;  Located near the grave where the first inscribed stone was found, the inscription on this second stone reads:

'''DEO VRID'''

'''SANCT'''

which has been interpreted as: ''To the holy god Viridios''.

==Etymology of the name==

The Ancaster inscriptions are in Latin, suggesting that the name of the god is also in Latin. If so, the name is used in the dative form, meaning ''to (the deity)''. The nominative form, and therefore the name of the god, would be Viridius or Viridios. Because of the Latin word '''''viridis''''' (''green, fresh, vigorous''), the simplest etymology proposed is that the god's name derives from this root word and refers to a local, tribal Roman god possessing these characteristics. The Green Man is a well-known pagan mythic personage whose human face sprouting green leaves or vines is found in some medieval churches.

Significant speculation exists as to the possible Celtic origins of the deity.&lt;ref&gt;Lincolnshire Museums Information Sheet. Archaeology Series No. 8 - Gods and Goddesses of Roman Ancaster. https://www.thecollectionmuseum.com/assets/downloads/IS_arch_8_gods_and_goddesses_of_roman_ancaster.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Wright specifically addresses such speculations, but notes that such a connection cannot be affirmatively made as there are no firm historico-linguistic connections in evidence between the modern conception of Viridios as a Celtic deity and the god Viridios referenced on the inscriptions: 

 For the stem of Trenico there is a Dobunnian Trenus cited on a diploma (CIL XVI, no. 49). 
 Holder (Altcelt. Sprachsch.) cites nine examples of -ico for men's names. Professor K. 
 Jackson concurs in 'lively', 'vigorous', or 'virile' as the probable translation 
 of Viridios, but says that certainty is unattainable as there are no derivatives in medieval 
 or modern Celtic languages.

==Related archaeological evidence==

An additional limestone figurative carving, probably used as an altarpiece, was also found near Ancaster and dated to the late Iron Age. &lt;ref&gt;Portable Aniquities Scheme. https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/52144&lt;/ref&gt; The carving depicts a naked man holding an axe, standing beneath an archway.  While no inscriptions appear on the stone, the location of the find near Ancaster, and the features displayed on the god that may depict suggested meanings of the name Viridios (''mighty, virile, verdant, fertile''), have led some to speculate that the altarpiece is a depiction of the god Viridios.

The '''West of Shetland Pipeline''' ('''WOSP''') is a pipeline system which transports [[natural gas]] from three offshore fields in the West of Shetland area to [[Sullom Voe Terminal]] on the [[Shetland Isles]] of [[Scotland]].

==West of Shetland area==
The West of Shetland area is a region in the northern [[Atlantic Ocean]], where there are currently three developed offshore fields; [[Schiehallion oilfield|Schiehallion]], [[Foinaven oilfield|Foinaven]] and [[Clair oilfield|Clair]]. A number of further hydrocarbon discoveries have been made in the area, but these are not currently considered to be economic due to the high costs of development. The [[Laggan oilfield|Laggan]]-Tormore and [[Rosebank oil and gas field|Rosebank]]-Lochnagar discoveries are in the process of being further appraised for development, but the WOSP is considered to be unable to carry the additional gas production from these fields.&lt;ref name=parliament&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
WOSP is owned collectively by the owners of the Schiehallion, Loyal, Foinaven and East Foinaven fields; each owner company holds divided capacity rights in accordance with its ownership interest. It is operated by [[BP]].

==Technical description==
The system consists of a {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} trunkline which begins near [[Schiehallion oilfield|Schiehallion]] and has length of {{convert|188|km}}.&lt;ref name=bp3&gt;

 | accessdate=2009-12-19}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It has a maximum capacity of {{convert|1.8|e9m3|abbr=off}} of gas per year.

Natural gas from the [[Clair oilfield|Clair field]] is delivered into the pipeline at the Clair ''tee'' midway along the pipeline {{convert|105|km}} from Sullom Voe.&lt;ref name=bp3/&gt;

Natural gas from WOSP is further transported by East of Shetland Pipeline (EOSP), NLGP and [[FLAGS]]/SEGAL systems for the delivery into the UK [[National Transmission System]] at [[St Fergus]] in the northeast of [[Scotland]], and for the delivery of separated natural gas liquids into either the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] operated SEGAL system or the onshore section of the BP-operated [[Forties pipeline system]].&lt;ref name=bp3/&gt; The gas delivered from the pipeline is also part of the [[Magnus oilfield]] [[enhanced oil recovery]] scheme where gas and [[natural gas liquids]] are piped to the Magnus platform and injected into the reservoir to increase the recoverable reserves from the development.&lt;ref name=offshore&gt;

The traditional East Asian calendars divide a year into 24 [[solar term]]s. '''''Yǔshuǐ''''', ''Usui'', ''Usu'', or ''Vũ thủy'' is the 2nd solar term. It begins when the Sun reaches the [[celestial longitude]] of 330° and ends when it reaches the longitude of 345°. It more often refers in particular to the day when the Sun is exactly at the celestial longitude of 330°. In [[Gregorian calendar]], it usually begins around 18 February (19 February East Asia time) and ends around 5 March.

==Pentads==
&lt;div style="clear: right; float: right; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;"&gt;{{Yushui}}&lt;/div&gt;
Each solar term can be divided into 3 [[Solar term|pentads]] (候). They are first pentad (初候), second pentad (次候) and last pentad (末候). Pentads in Yushui including:

; China
* First pentad: 獺祭魚, 'Otters make offerings of fish'. As fish begin to swim upstream, they are hunted by otters, which are believed to offer the fish to heaven.
* Second pentad: 鴻雁來, 'The wild geese arrive'. Wild geese begin to make their northward migration, following the onset of spring.
* Last pentad: 草木萌動, 'Trees and grass put forth shoots'.

; Japan
* First pentad: 土脉潤起
* Second pentad: 霞始靆
* Last pentad: 草木萠動
