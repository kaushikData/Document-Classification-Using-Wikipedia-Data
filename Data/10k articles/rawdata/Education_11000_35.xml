'''Activity theory''' ('''AT'''; {{lang-ru|link=no|Теория деятельности}})&lt;ref&gt;aka [[Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT)|Cultural-Historical Activity Theory]]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[umbrella term]] for a line of eclectic social sciences theories and research with its roots in the Soviet psychological activity theory pioneered by [[Lev Vygotsky]]&lt;ref name="bioBook"&gt;Yasnitsky, A. (2018). [https://www.routledge.com/Vygotsky-An-Intellectual-Biography/Yasnitsky/p/book/9781138806740 Vygotsky: An Intellectual Biography]. London and New York: Routledge [http://individual.utoronto.ca/yasnitsky/texts/Yasnitsky_2018_Vygotsky_bookPreview.pdf BOOK PREVIEW]&lt;/ref&gt; , [[Aleksei N. Leontiev|Alexei Leont'ev]] and [[Sergei Rubinstein]]. These scholars sought to understand human activities as [[Systems thinking|systemic]] and socially situated phenomena and to go beyond paradigms of reflexology (the teaching of [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] and his followers) and [[classical conditioning]] (the teaching of [[Ivan Pavlov]] and his school), [[psychoanalysis]] and [[behaviorism]]. It became one of the major psychological approaches in the former [[USSR]], being widely used in both theoretical and applied psychology, and in education, [[professional training]], [[ergonomics]], [[social psychology]] and [[work psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bedney|Meister|1997}}

{{cite book |last1=Bedny |first1=Gregory |last2=Meister |first2=David |title=The Russian Theory of Activity: Current Applications To Design and Learning |series=Series in Applied Psychology |year=1997 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-8058-1771-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activity theory is more of a descriptive meta-theory or framework than a predictive theory. It considers an entire work/activity system (including teams, organizations, etc.) beyond just one actor or user. It accounts for environment, history of the person, culture, role of the artifact, motivations, and complexity of real-life activity. One of the strengths of AT is that it bridges the gap between the individual subject and the social reality—it studies both through the mediating activity. The unit of analysis in AT is the concept of object-oriented, collective and culturally mediated human activity, or ''activity system''. This system includes the object (or objective), subject, mediating artifacts (signs and tools), rules, community and division of labor. The motive for the activity in AT is created through the tensions and contradictions within the elements of the system.&lt;ref name="Perspectives on Activity Theory"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Engeström |first1=Yrjö |last2=Miettinen |first2=Reijo |last3=Punamäki |first3=Raija-Leena |title=Perspectives on Activity Theory |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-43730-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ethnographer [[Bonnie Nardi]], a leading theorist in AT, activity theory "focuses on practice, which obviates the need to distinguish 'applied' from 'pure' science—understanding everyday practice in the real world is the very objective of scientific practice. ... The object of activity theory is to understand the unity of consciousness and activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nardi |first=Bonnie |title=Context and Consciousness: Activity Theory and Human-Computer Interaction |year=1995 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-14058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes called "Cultural-Historical Activity Theory", this approach is particularly useful for studying a group that exists "largely in virtual form, its communications mediated largely through electronic and printed texts."&lt;ref&gt;Foot, K. (2001).  Cultural-Historical Activity Theory as Practical Theory: Illuminating the Development of a Conflict Monitoring Network. Communication Theory, 11(1), 56–83. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2885.2001.tb00233.x}} http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2001.tb00233.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

AT is particularly useful as a lens in qualitative research methodologies (e.g., [[ethnography]], [[case study]]). AT provides a method of understanding and analyzing a phenomenon, finding patterns and making inferences across interactions, describing phenomena and presenting phenomena through a built-in language and rhetoric. A particular activity is a goal-directed or purposeful interaction of a subject with an object through the use of tools. These tools are exteriorized forms of mental processes manifested in constructs, whether physical or psychological. AT recognizes the internalization and externalization of cognitive processes involved in the use of tools, as well as the transformation or development that results from the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Fjeld, M., Lauche, K., Bichsel, M., Voorhorst, F., Krueger, H., Rauterberg, M. (2002): Physical and Virtual Tools: Activity Theory Applied to the Design of Groupware. In B. A. Nardi &amp; D. F. Redmiles (eds.) A Special Issue of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW): Activity Theory and the Practice of Design, Volume 11 (1–2), pp. 153–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origins of activity theory can be traced to several sources, which have subsequently given rise to various complementary and intertwined strands of development. This account will focus on three of the most important of these strands. The first is associated with the [[Moscow Institute of Psychology]] and in particular the "troika" of young Russian researchers, [[Vygotsky Circle|Vygotsky, Leont'ev and Luria]]. Vygotsky founded cultural-historical psychology, a field that became the basis for modern AT; Leont'ev, one of the principal founders of activity theory, both developed and reacted against Vygotsky's work. Leont'ev's formulation of general activity theory is currently the most influential in post-Soviet developments in AT, which have largely been in social-scientific, organizational, and writing-studies rather than psychological research.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The second major line of development within activity theory involves Russian scientists, such as [[P. K. Anokhin]] and [[Nikolai Bernstein]], more directly concerned with the neurophysiological basis of activity; its foundation is associated with the Soviet philosopher of psychology [[Sergei Rubinstein]]. This work was subsequently developed by researchers such as Pushkin, Zinchenko &amp; Gordeeva, Ponomarenko, Zarakovsky and others, and is currently most well-known through the work on systemic-structural activity theory being carried out by [[G. Z. Bedny]] and his associates.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Finally, in the Western world, discussions and use of AT are primarily framed within the Scandinavian activity theory strand, developed by [[Yrjö Engeström]].

===Russian===
After Vygotsky's early death, Leont'ev became the leader of the research group nowadays known as the [[Kharkov School of Psychology]] and extended Vygotsky's research framework in significantly new ways. Leont'ev first examined the [[comparative psychology|psychology of animals]], looking at the different degrees to which animals can be said to have mental processes. He concluded that Pavlov's reflexionism was not a sufficient explanation of animal behaviour and that animals have an active relation to reality, which he called "activity". In particular, the behaviour of higher primates such as chimpanzees could only be explained by the ape's formation of multi-phase plans using tools.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Leont'ev then progressed to humans and pointed out that people engage in "actions" that do not in themselves satisfy a need, but contribute towards the eventual satisfaction of a need. Often, these actions only make sense in a social context of a shared work activity. This led him to a distinction between "activities", which satisfy a need, and the "actions" that constitute the activities. Leont'ev also argued that the activity in which a person is involved is reflected in their mental activity, that is (as he puts it) material reality is "presented" to consciousness, but only in its vital meaning or significance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Activity theory also influenced the development of [[organizational-activity game]] as developed by [[Georgy Shchedrovitsky]].&lt;ref name=Kerr&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerr|first=Stephen|title=Why Vygotsky?|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/stkerr/whylsv.html|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandinavian===
AT remained virtually unknown outside the Soviet Union until the mid-1980s, when it was picked up by Scandinavian researchers. The first international conference on activity theory was not held until 1986. The earliest non-Soviet paper cited by Nardi is a 1987 paper by Yrjö Engeström: "Learning by expanding". This resulted in a reformulation of AT. Kuutti notes that the term "activity theory" "can be used in two senses: referring to the original Soviet tradition or referring to the international, multi-voiced community applying the original ideas and developing them further."&lt;ref name="Perspectives on Activity Theory"/&gt;

The Scandinavian AT school of thought seeks to integrate and develop concepts from [[Vygotsky]]'s [[Cultural-historical psychology]] and Leont'ev's activity theory with Western intellectual developments such as [[Cognitive Science]], [[American Pragmatism]], [[Constructivism (psychological school)|Constructivism]], and [[Actor-Network Theory]]. It is known as Scandinavian activity theory. Work in the systems-structural theory of activity is also being carried on by researchers in the US and UK.

Some of the changes are a systematisation of Leont'ev's work. Although Leont'ev's exposition is clear and well structured, it is not as well-structured as the formulation by Yrjö Engeström. Kaptelinin remarks that Engeström "proposed a scheme of activity different from that by Leont'ev; it contains three interacting entities—the individual, the object and the community—instead of the two components—the individual and the object—in Leont'ev's original scheme."&lt;ref&gt;Kaptelinin 1996, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Some changes were introduced, apparently by importing notions from [[human–computer interaction]] theory. For instance, the notion of ''rules'', which is not found in Leont'ev, was introduced. Also, the notion of collective subject was introduced in the 1970s and 1980s (Leont'ev refers to "joint labour activity", but only has individuals, not groups, as activity subjects).

==Theory==
[[File:Activity system.png|thumb|Activity system diagram]]The goal of activity theory is understanding the mental capabilities of a single individual. However, it rejects the ''isolated'' individuals as insufficient [[unit of analysis]], analyzing the cultural and technical aspects of [[social action|human action]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 =Bertelsen|first1= Olav W. |first2 = Susanne|last2= Bødker|author2-link= Susanne Bødker |date = 2003 |chapter = Chapter 11: Activity Theory |chapterurl=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/794e/762dc34936f768454b56bbafd9c18eb84cfa.pdf|title = HCI Models, Theories, and Framewors: Toward an Interdisciplinary Science|editor-last = Carroll|editor-first = J.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activity theory is most often used to describe actions in a [[Sociotechnical systems|socio-technical system]] through six related elements (Bryant et al. as defined by Leonti'ev 1981 and redefined in Engeström 1987) of a conceptual system expanded by more nuanced theories:
* Object-orientedness – the objective of the activity system. Object refers to the objectiveness of the reality; items are considered objective according to natural sciences but also have social and cultural properties.
* Subject or internalization – actors engaged in the activities; the traditional notion of mental processes
* Community or externalization – social context; all actors involved in the activity system
* Tools or tool mediation – the artifacts (or concepts) used by actors in the system. Tools influence actor-structure interactions, they change with accumulating experience. In addition to physical shape, the knowledge also evolves. Tools are influenced by culture, and their use is a way for the accumulation and transmission of social knowledge. Tools influence both the agents and the structure.
* [[Division of labor]] – social strata, hierarchical structure of activity, the division of activities among actors in the system
* Rules – conventions, guidelines and rules regulating activities in the system

Activity theory helps explain how [[social artifact]]s and [[social organization]] mediate social action (Bryant et al.).

==Information systems==
The application of activity theory to information systems derives from the work of Bonnie Nardi and [[Kari Kuutti]]. Kuutti's work is addressed below. Nardi's approach is, briefly, as follows: Nardi (p.&amp;nbsp;6) described activity theory as "...a powerful and clarifying descriptive tool rather than a strongly predictive theory. The object of activity theory is to understand the unity of consciousness and activity...Activity theorists argue that consciousness is not a set of discrete disembodied cognitive acts (decision making, classification, remembering), and certainly it is not the brain; rather, consciousness is located in everyday practice: you are what you do."&lt;ref name="Nardi, B. A. 1996 pp. 1-8"&gt;Nardi, B. A. (1996). Activity theory and human computer interaction In B. A. Nardi (Ed.), Context and Consciousness: Activity Theory and Human-Computer Interaction (pp. 1–8). Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nardi (p.&amp;nbsp;5) also argued that "activity theory proposes a strong notion of ''mediation''—all human experience is shaped by the tools and sign systems we use." &lt;ref name="Nardi, B. A. 1996 pp. 1-8"/&gt; Nardi (p.&amp;nbsp;6) explained that "a basic tenet of activity theory is that a notion of consciousness is central to a depiction of activity. Vygotsky described consciousness as a phenomenon that unifies attention, intention, memory, reasoning, and speech..."&lt;ref name="Nardi, B. A. 1996 pp. 1-8"/&gt; and (p.&amp;nbsp;7) "Activity theory, with its emphasis on the importance of motive and consciousness—which belongs only to humans—sees people and things as fundamentally different. People are not reduced to 'nodes' or 'agents' in a system; 'information processing' is not seen as something to be modelled in the same way for people and machines."&lt;ref name="Nardi, B. A. 1996 pp. 1-8"/&gt;

In a later work, Nardi et al. in comparing activity theory with cognitive science, argue that "activity theory is above all a social theory of consciousness" and therefore "... activity theory wants to define consciousness, that is, all the mental functioning including
remembering, deciding, classifying, generalising, abstracting and so forth, as a product of our social interactions with other people and of our use of tools."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} For Activity Theorists "consciousness" seems to refer to any mental functioning, whereas most other approaches to psychology distinguish conscious from unconscious functions.

Over the last 15 years the use and exploration of activity theory in information systems has grown.&lt;ref&gt;Ditsa, G. (2003). Activity theory as a theoretical foundation for information systems research Information management (pp. 192–231): IGI Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen, R., Sharman, R., Rao, H. R., &amp; Upadhyaya, S. J. (2013). Data Model Development for Fire Related Extreme Events: An Activity Theory Approach. MIS Quarterly, in press.&lt;/ref&gt; One stream of research has focused on technology mediated change and the implementation of technologies and how they disrupt, change and improve organisational work activity. In these studies, activity systems are used to understand emergent contradictions in the work activity, which are temporarily resolved using information systems (tools) and/or arising from the introduction of information systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Allen|first1 = David K.|last2 = Brown|first2 = Andrew|last3 = Karanasios|first3 = Stan |last4 = Norman|first4 = Alistair|date = 2013|title =How should technology-mediated organizational change be explained?

(2011). Working with activity theory: Context, technology, and information behavior. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62(4), 776–788. {{doi|10.1002/asi.21441}} http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.21441/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, T. D. (2008). Activity theory and information seeking. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 42, 119–161  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aris.2008.1440420111/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;
In the field of ICT and development (a field of study within information systems) the use of activity theory has also been used to inform development of IT systems &lt;ref&gt;Korpela, M., Mursu, A., &amp; Soriyan, H. A. (2002). Information Systems Development as an Activity. Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 11, 111–128.&lt;/ref&gt; and to frame the study of ICT in development settings.&lt;ref&gt;Karanasios, S., &amp; Allen, D. K. (2013). ICT and Development in the Context of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Closure. Information Systems Journal, 23(2). {{doi|10.1111/isj.12011}} http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/isj.12011/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Etengoff &amp; Daiute have conducted recent work exploring how social media interfaces can be productively used to mediate conflicts. Their work has illustrated this perspective with analyses of online interactions between gay men and their religious family members&lt;ref&gt;Etengoff, C. &amp; Daiute, C. (2015). Online Coming Out Communications between Gay Men and their Religious Family Allies: A Family of Choice and Origin Perspective, Journal of GLBT Family Studies. {{doi|10.1080/1550428X.2014.964442}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sunni-Muslim emerging adults' efforts to maintain a positive ethnic identity via online religious forums in post 9/11 contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Etengoff, C. &amp; Daiute, C., (2013). Sunni-Muslim American Religious Development during Emerging Adulthood, Journal of Adolescent Research, 28(6), 690–714. {{doi|10.1177/0743558413477197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human–computer interaction==
The rise of the personal computer challenged the focus in traditional systems developments on mainframe systems for automation of existing work routines. It furthermore brought forth a need to focus on how to work on materials and objects through the computer. In the search of theoretical and methodical perspectives suited to deal with issues of flexibility and more advanced mediation between the human being, material and outcomes through the interface, it seemed promising to turn to the still rather young HCI research tradition that had emerged primarily in the US (for further discussion see Bannon &amp; Bødker, 1991).

Specifically the cognitive science-based theories lacked means of addressing a number of issues that came out of the empirical projects (see Bannon &amp; Bødker, 1991): 1. Many of the early advanced user interfaces assumed that the users were the designers themselves, and accordingly built on an assumption of a generic user, without concern for qualifications, work environment, division of work, etc. 2.In particular the role of the artifact as it stands between the user and her materials, objects and outcomes was ill understood. 3. In validating findings and designs there was a heavy focus on novice users whereas everyday use by experienced users and concerns for the development of expertise were hardly addressed. 4.Detailed task analysis and the idealized models created through task analysis failed to capture the complexity and contingency of real-life action. 5.From the point of view of complex work settings, it was striking how most HCI focused on one user – one computer in contrast to the ever-ongoing cooperation and coordination of real work situations (this problem later lead to the development of CSCW). 6.Users were mainly seen as objects of study.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Because of these shortcomings, it was necessary to move outside cognitive science-based HCI to find or develop the necessary theoretical platform. European psychology had taken different paths than had American with much inspiration from [[dialectical materialism]] (Hydén 1981, Engeström, 1987). Philosophers such as Heidegger and Wittgenstein came to play an important role, primarily through discussions of the limitations of AI (Winograd &amp; Flores 1986, Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus 1986). Suchman (1987) with a similar focus introduced [[ethnomethodology]] into the discussions, and Ehn (1988) based his treatise of design of computer artifacts on Marx, Heidegger and Wittgenstein.
The development of the activity theoretical angle was primarily carried out by Bødker (1991, 1996) and by Kuutti (Bannon &amp; Kuutti, 1993, Kuutti, 1991, 1996), both with strong inspiration from Scandinavian activity theory groups in psychology. Bannon (1990, 1991) and Grudin (1990a and b) made significant contributions to the furthering of the approach by making it available to the HCI audience. The work of Kaptelinin (1996) has been important to connect to the earlier development of activity theory in Russia. Nardi produced the, hitherto, most applicable collection of activity theoretical HCI literature (Nardi, 1996).

===Systemic-structural activity theory (SSAT)===
At the end of the 1990s, a group of Russian and American activity theorists working in the systems-cybernetic tradition of Bernshtein and Anokhin began to publish English-language articles and books dealing with topics in human factors and ergonomics&lt;ref&gt;Bedny, G. Z. &amp; Meister, D. (1997). The Russian Theory of Activity: Current Applications to Design and Learning, Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; and, latterly, human–computer interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Bedny, G. Z. &amp; Karwowski, W. (2003b). A Systemic-Structural Activity Approach to the Design of Human-Computer Interaction Tasks. International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 16, pp. 235–260.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the rubric of '''systemic-structural activity theory''' (SSAT), this work represents a modern synthesis within activity theory which brings together the cultural-historical and systems-structural strands of the tradition (as well as other work within Soviet psychology such as the Psychology of Set) with findings and methods from Western human factors/ergonomics and cognitive psychology.

The development of SSAT has been specifically oriented toward the analysis and design of the basic elements of human work activity: tasks, tools, methods, objects and results, and the skills, experience and abilities of involved subjects. SSAT has developed techniques for both the qualitative and quantitative description of work activity.&lt;ref&gt;Bedny, G. Z. &amp; Karwowski, W. (2006) A Systemic-Structural Theory of Activity: Applications to Human Performance and Work Design. Boca Raton, CRC Press/Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; Its design-oriented analyses specifically focus on the interrelationship between the structure and self-regulation of work activity and the configuration of its material components.

==An explanation==
This section presents a short introduction to activity theory, and some brief comments on human creativity in activity theory and the implications of activity theory for tacit knowledge and learning.

===Activities===
Activity theory begins with the notion of activity. An activity is seen as a system of human "doing" whereby a subject works on an object in order to obtain a desired outcome. In order to do this, the subject employs tools, which may be external (e.g. an axe, a computer) or internal (e.g. a plan). As an illustration, an activity might be the operation of an automated call centre. As we shall see later, many subjects may be involved in the activity and each subject may have one or more motives (e.g. improved supply management, career advancement or gaining control over a vital organisational power source). A simple example of an activity within a call centre might be a telephone operator (subject) who is modifying a customer's billing record (object) so that the billing data is correct (outcome) using a graphical front end to a database (tool).{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Kuutti formulates activity theory in terms of the structure of an activity. "An activity is a form of doing directed to an object, and activities are distinguished from each other according
to their objects. Transforming the object into an outcome motivates the existence of an activity. An object can be a material thing, but it can also be less tangible."&lt;ref name="Perspectives on Activity Theory"/&gt;

Kuutti then adds a third term, the tool, which 'mediates' between the activity and the object. "The tool is at the same time both enabling and limiting: it empowers the subject in the transformation process with the historically collected experience and skill 'crystallised' to it, but it also restricts the interaction to be from the perspective of that particular tool or instrument; other potential features of an object remain invisible to the subject...".&lt;ref name="Perspectives on Activity Theory"/&gt;

As Verenikina remarks, tools are "social objects with certain modes of operation developed socially in the course of labour and are only possible because they correspond to the objectives of a practical action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Verenikina, Irina M|title=Vygotsky in twenty-first-century research|year=2010|page=16|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2337&amp;context=edupapers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels===
An activity is modelled as a three-level hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Engestrom1987"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engeström|first1=Yrjö|title=Learning by Expanding: An Activity-theoretical Approach to Developmental Research|date=1987|publisher=Orienta-Konsultit Oy|isbn=9789519593326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuutti schematises processes in activity theory as a three-level system.

Verenikina paraphrases Leont'ev as explaining that "the non-coincidence of action and operations... appears in actions with tools, that is, material objects which are crystallised operations, not actions nor goals. If a person is confronted with a specific goal of, say, dismantling a machine, then they must make use of a variety of operations; it makes no difference how the individual operations were learned because the formulation of the operation proceeds differently to the formulation of the goal that initiated the action."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

The levels of activity are also characterised by their purposes: "Activities are oriented to motives, that is, the objects that are impelling by themselves. Each motive is an object, material or ideal, that satisfies a need. Actions are the processes functionally subordinated to activities; they are directed at specific conscious goals... Actions are realised through operations that are determined by the actual conditions of activity."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Engeström developed an extended model of an activity, which adds another component, community ("those who share the same object"), and then adds rules to mediate between subject and community, and the division of labour to mediate between object and community.

Kuutti asserts that "These three classes should be understood broadly. A tool can be anything used in the transformation process, including both material tools and tools for thinking. Rules cover both explicit and implicit norms, conventions, and social relations within a community. Division of labour refers to the explicit and implicit organisation of the community as related to the transformation process of the object into the outcome."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Activity theory therefore includes the notion that an activity is carried out within a social context, or specifically in a community. The way in which the activity fits into the context is thus established by two resulting concepts:
* rules: these are both explicit and implicit and define how subjects must fit into the community;
* division of labour: this describes how the object of the activity relates to the community.

===The internal plane of action===
Activity theory provides a number of useful concepts that can be used to address the lack of expression for 'soft' factors which are inadequately represented by most process modelling frameworks. One such concept is the internal plane of action. Activity theory recognises that each activity takes place in two planes: the external plane and the internal plane. The external plane represents the objective components of the action while the internal plane represents the subjective components of the action. Kaptelinin defines the ''internal plane of actions'' as "[...] a concept developed in activity theory that refers to the human ability to perform manipulations with an internal representation of external objects before starting actions with these objects in reality."&lt;ref&gt;Kaptelinin 1996, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of motives, goals and conditions discussed above also contribute to the modelling of soft factors. One principle of activity theory is that many activities have multiple motivation ('polymotivation'). For instance, a programmer in writing a program may address goals aligned towards multiple motives such as increasing his or her annual bonus, obtaining relevant career experience and contributing to organisational objectives.

Activity theory further argues that subjects are grouped into communities, with rules mediating between subject and community and a division of labour mediating between object and community. A subject may be part of several communities and a community, itself, may be part of other communities.

===Human creativity===
Human creativity plays an important role in activity theory, that "human beings... are essentially creative beings" in "the creative, non-predictable character". Tikhomirov also analyses the importance of ''creative activity'', contrasting it to ''routine'' activity, and notes the important shift brought about by computerisation in the balance towards creative activity.

Karl Marx, a sociological theorist, argued that humans are unique compared to other species in that humans create everything they need to survive. According to Marx, this is described as species-being. Marx believed we find our true identity in what we produce in our personal labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The social lens : an invitation to social and sociological theory|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|isbn=9781412992787|edition=Third|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|oclc=829099056|date = 2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning and tacit knowledge===
Activity theory has an interesting approach to the difficult problems of ''learning'' and, in particular, ''tacit knowledge''. Learning has been a favourite subject of management theorists, but it has often been presented in an abstract way separated from the work processes to which the learning should apply. Activity theory provides a potential corrective to this tendency. For instance, Engeström's review of Nonaka's work on ''[[knowledge management|knowledge creation]]'' suggests enhancements based on activity theory, in particular suggesting that the organisational learning process includes preliminary stages of goal and problem formation not found in Nonaka. Lompscher, rather than seeing learning as ''transmission'', sees the formation of learning goals and the
student's understanding of which things they need to acquire as the key to the formation of the learning activity.

Of particular importance to the study of learning in organisations is the problem of ''tacit knowledge'', which according to Nonaka, "is highly personal and hard to formalise, making it difficult to communicate to others or to share with others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nonaka |first1=Ikujiro |last2=Takeuchi |first2=Hirotaka |title=The Knowledge-Creating Company: How Japanese Companies Create the Dynamics of Innovation |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-509269-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leont'ev's concept of operation provides an important insight into this problem. In addition, the key idea of ''internalisation'' was originally introduced by Vygotsky as "the internal reconstruction of an external operation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind in society: The development of higher psychological processes.|last=Vygotsky|first=L. S.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-674-57628-5|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internalisation has subsequently become a key term of the theory of tacit knowledge and has been defined as "a process of embodying explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Internalisation has been described by Engeström as the "key psychological mechanism" discovered by Vygotsky and is further discussed by Verenikina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2155">The ''' California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS)''' is a summer program for high school students in [[California]] for the purpose of preparing them for careers in mathematics and sciences. It is often abbreviated COSMOS, although COSMOS does not contain the correct letters to create an accurate abbreviation. The program is hosted on four different campuses of the [[University of California]], at [[University of California, Davis|Davis]], [[University of California, Irvine|Irvine]], [[University of California, San Diego|San Diego]], and [[University of California, Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]].

==History==
COSMOS was established by the [[California State Legislature]] in the summer of 2000 to stimulate the interests of and provide opportunities for talented California high school students. The California State Summer School for Mathematics &amp; Science is modeled after the [[California State Summer School for the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://cosmos-ucop.ucdavis.edu/main/about# |title=About CSSSA |access-date=2016-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126222845/https://cosmos-ucop.ucdavis.edu/main/about# |archive-date=2016-01-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first summer, 292 students enrolled in the program. Each COSMOS campus only holds 150 students, so selection is competitive.  It is a great experience in exploring the sciences and a good activity for college applications, especially the University of California application.  This program is designed for extremely gifted students who make amazing discoveries in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) areas.

'''Charles III University of Madrid''' ({{lang-es|'''Universidad Carlos III de Madrid'''}}) ('''UC3M''') is a [[public university]] in the [[Community of Madrid]], Spain. UC3M is an institution with a distinctly international profile. It offers a broad range of master’s and bachelor's degree programs in English and nearly 20% of the student body is made up of international students. It is the first university in Spain and the third in Europe in the number of its students participating in the [[Erasmus Programme|Erasmus]] student exchange programs.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The university has a strong reputation in business subjects, in particular economics, which is regularly ranked amongst the top 50 institutions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title="QS World University Rankings 2015" | url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2015/economics-econometrics#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known for its high academic demand to degree students. It also holds the highest admission grade requirement in Madrid for several degree programs such as Business, Law, Political Science, Economics, International Studies, Accounting, Journalism or Biomedical Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title="Admission Grades for Madrid Public Universities 2015/16" | url=http://www.ucm.es/data/cont/docs/3-2015-10-05-Notas%202015-2016%20FASE%20B%20completo.pdf= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also ranks among the world’s top 150 universities in employability according to the 2016 ''[[QS World University Rankings]]''.

The university’s motto is “''Homo homini sacra res”'' ("Man is a sacred thing to man"), a quote adapted from [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]] (''[[Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium|Ad Lucilium]]'' [[:s:la:Epistulae morales ad Lucilium/Liber XIV - XV#XCV. SENECA LVCILIO SVO SALVTEM|XCV:33]]: "Homo, sacra res homini").

== Financing of the university ==
Public universities in Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universidadsa.com/financiacion-de-la-universidad/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103015418/http://www.universidadsa.com/financiacion-de-la-universidad/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-11-03|title=Financiación de la universidad|trans-title=Financing of the university|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; occupy a large share of the national budget. Almost 80% of the funding for public universities is borne by the taxpayers, with student fees accounting for most of the remainder of this funding. Universities in Spain do not have final oversight over their funding; this is done by the government which receives, administrates, and distributes all sources of revenue.

=== Financing projects ===
The UC3M uses the [[crowdfunding]] system to finance its projects. The process usually involves '''four main steps''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://e-archivo.uc3m.es/handle/10016/20142#preview|title=Crowd funding|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly a scientist, student or an alumnus will develop an idea about research, innovation, and/or the diffusion of knowledge. Secondly they spread this idea via [http://www.goteo.org/about Gotero.org], which is a website where donors can search for and endorse projects listed on the webpage. Thirdly, an interested donor will begin financing a project. Finally, the project reaches sufficient levels of funding, publicity, and related improvements to become reality.

There are several different '''types of crowdfunding.''' Rewards-based crowdfunding is when a sponsor funds a project for an incentive or reward in return, generally products or services that result from the project. Equity crowdfunding results in a sponsor receiving some form of equity in return for their investment. Debt-based funding involves a sponsor lending money to the project, with the promise of their investment being returned plus interest. Donation-based crowdfunding involves a donor investing out of altruistic interest, without any interest in financial or material rewards in return.

Crowdfunding has provided opportunities to many people for developing campus projects. At UC3M, Isabel García Gutiérrez,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://e-archivo.uc3m.es/bitstream/handle/10016/21431/i3_Crowd_UC3M.pdf?sequence=1|title=Crowd_UC3M|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is the vice rector of the entrepreneurship and science park, said that the university turned to this system because of its innovative potential. The prior experience of the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]]'s use of the crowdfunding system was also a helpful example to model from.

==== Financing cultural, sports, and volunteer activities ====
The UC3M as with all other public universities received government funding, so students' tuition fees are a small percentage of the actual education costs. However, extra-curricular activities such as cultural, sports and volunteerism activities aren’t included in the enrollment fees, and require additional fees for participation.

===== UC3M Foundation =====
The UC3M Foundation is a private nonprofit organization. Created in 1990, its objectives are the promotion and financing of social, cultural, and scientific activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/fundacion/presentacion|title=Foundation of the Uc3m|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Objectives of the UC3M Foundation:'''

'''College extension''': This includes courses for seniors (cultural programs and classroom continuing education), and seminars on exchanges and financial markets for academic credit. The You click course is directed towards young people who want to enter the labor market as professionals with improved knowledge about social media, networking, communication and digital characters.

'''Language Center''': Focus on development in different languages like English, French, German, Chinese, Italian and others; presenting opportunities for students to be more motivated in learning languages; using new technologies and assistance with preparation for the different language exams.

'''Guidance and employment (SOPP):''' Large-platform focus on giving facilities to students and companies to take advantage in the future contracting of students in order to gain experience for the labour market.

'''Dormitories and accommodation:''' Providing facilities for accommodation to students and university faculty. Consists of three large facilities, two in Getafe (Gregorio Peces-Barba and Fernando de los Ríos dormitories) and one in Leganés (Fernando Abril Matorell). All of these facilities are in close proximity to their respective campuses. An increasing number of both foreign students and students from other parts of Spain is raising demand in the residences.

'''Publications and reports:''' Study and analyze the impacts in today´s world of the different degrees offered by the university.

'''Social commitment''': Primarily intended to financially assist students with merit-based needs, disabilities, and lower-income students. This also includes the importance of donations of surplus equipment to various NGOs, recycling, and positive synergies with related organizations.

'''The Children's Museum of Bogotá''' ('''Fundación Museo de los Niños''') is a privately managed [[museum]] foundation in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia|Colombia's]] capital city, established in 1986 and aimed at teaching children about [[science]], [[technology]], [[culture]] and [[art]]s. The foundation operates the Children's Museum in an 8,000 m² (86,000&amp;nbsp;ft.²) building in the geographical centre of Bogotá, in which over 23 different modules and hundreds of individual exhibits are housed. The [[museum]] serves approximately 150,000 visitors per year &amp;mdash; 69% of them children under 11 years of age that come to ''"learn by playing"'' in the exhibits.

In addition to guided tours, the Children's Museum conducts [[workshop]]s, special vacation programs for children and highly structured events for schools.

To celebrate their 15th anniversary, the museum invited the most important young Colombian artists to each paint a [[mural]] on the museum walls. This resulted in a collection of 42 murals which have become a landmark for art students in Bogotá. Another highly important program of the Museum is the ''"Computer Clubhouse"'' &amp;mdash; an international program promoted by the [[Intel Corporation]] and the [[Museum of Science, Boston]]. ''"Computer Clubhouse"'' teaches children of low income families computer skills for [[computer animation]], [[graphic design]], [[composition (language)|composing]] and editing, as a means to close the [[digital divide]] in our society. An introduction to [[robotics]] is also included in this program.

In the outer gardens of the museum, a real [[Boeing 720]] aircraft (without actual function, fuel, electricity or engines) is present to teach children the basics of aeronautics. The airliner was donated by [[Avianca]] (the biggest airline in Colombia) in the mid 1980s.

The museum also features a room with a small representation of a city's roads to teach children traffic signs and behaviour while driving or walking on the streets

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70383">[[Civil service]] [[reform]] is a deliberate action to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, professionalism, representativity and democratic character of a [[civil service]], with a view to promoting better delivery of [[public goods]] and services, with increased [[accountability]]. Such actions can include data gathering and analysis, organizational [[restructuring]], improving [[human resource management]] and [[training]], enhancing [[wages|pay]] and [[Employee benefit|benefits]] while assuring [[sustainability]] under overall [[finance|fiscal]] constraints, and strengthening measures for [[performance management]], [[public participation]], [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]],  and combating [[Political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/civil-service-reform/|title=Civil service reform - GSDRC|work=GSDRC|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil service reform agenda in [[Developing country|developing countries]] has evolved and changed its focus over the decades. The [[academic literature]] on civil service reform has provided arguments and counterarguments clarifying how several approaches to reform affect the overall performance of the civil service.  The increasing availability of empirical [[data]] allows to test the [[effectiveness]] of specific reforms in a given context. While designing effective civil service reforms is a tremendously complex task considering that the right mix of corruption control and performance improvements may vary greatly across and within countries, [[Empirical research|empirical]] as well as [[qualitative research]] can contribute to the body of evidence-based knowledge on civil service reforms in developing countries.

Many challenges remain as persisting [[political economy]] factors hinder the success of civil service reforms.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simone|first=Bunse|last2=Verena|first2=Fritz|date=2012-08-01|title=Making public sector reforms work : political and economic contexts, incentives, and strategies|pages=1–54|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/649411468328580569/Making-public-sector-reforms-work-political-and-economic-contexts-incentives-and-strategies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches to Civil Service Reform ==

=== The Influence of Weberian Bureaucracy ===
[[Max Weber]]'s model of the ideal type of [[public administration]] has been an influential approach to civil service reforms in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/capacity-building/global-centre-for-public-service-excellence/PS-Reform.html|title=From Old Public Administration to the New Public Service|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bureaucratic]] type of administration contrasts with the [[Inheritance|patrimonial]] type in its underlying organizing principles. Weber’s organization of the public administration relies on a clearly defined hierarchical structure with a system of subordination and supervision, a division of labor and specified positions with assigned responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Udy|first=Stanley H.|date=1959|title="Bureaucracy" and "Rationality" in Weber's Organization Theory: An Empirical Study|jstor=2088566|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=24|issue=6|pages=791–795|doi=10.2307/2088566}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to the patrimonial system in which there is no distinction between private and public domains, the [[Weberian bureaucracy]] is defined by its impersonal and impartial character. Civil servants operate according to a set of rules and procedures they must observe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahlström|first=Carl|last2=Lapuente|first2=Victor|last3=Teorell|first3=Jan|date=2009|title=Bureaucracy, Politics and Corruption|ssrn=1450742|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impartiality is in part attained through the professionalization of the civil service and [[meritocratic]] recruitment through competitive examinations.  For full-time and professionalized civil servants, public office-holding becomes a 'vocation'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Weberian [[ideal-typical]] principles have served as foundations for civil service reforms in developing countries. Scholars and policymakers have been interested in identifying the specific features that determine bureaucratic efficiency and corruption and the mechanisms through which these features increase effectiveness and restrict corrupt behaviour in the civil service.

Empirical studies&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-01-01|title=Bureaucratic structure and bureaucratic performance in less developed countries|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272799000444|journal=Journal of Public Economics|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=49–71|doi=10.1016/S0047-2727(99)00044-4|issn=0047-2727|last1=Rauch|first1=James E.|last2=Evans|first2=Peter B.|citeseerx=10.1.1.203.288}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that meritocratic recruitment of public officials in particular is associated with lower corruption levels.  There are several ways in which meritocratic recruitment and promotion can restrict corrupt behaviour. To begin with, administering entry examinations and educational attainment requirements enable the selection of competent civil servants. As a matter of fact, a study by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2013/03/arezki.htm|title=Degrees of Development- Finance &amp; Development, March 2013|website=www.imf.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that better-educated civil servants are related to lower levels of corruption, better performance including better public finance management and higher [[tax revenue]] mobilization as well as higher [[economic growth]].

Furthermore, the internal promotion and career stability of merit-recruited civil servants create a sense of shared commitment to the 'vocation' of office-holding that establishes '[[Esprit de corps|esprit de corps']], making it harder for corruption to occur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other evidence&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; suggests that a professional merit-based civil service preempts corruption not necessarily through the selection of capable officials but rather through the appointment of civil servants whose interests differ from politicians'. Misaligned interests create a coordination problem which prevents corrupt practices and instead introduces a system of mutual monitoring.

=== Employment and Pay Reforms ===
During the 1980s, developing countries subject to [[structural adjustment]] programs (SAPs) experienced fiscal austerity notably manifested through pressures to reduce the public wage bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbara|first=Nunberg|date=1989-12-31|title=Public sector pay and employment reform : a review of World Bank experience|pages=1|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/424331468739769767/Public-sector-pay-and-employment-reform-a-review-of-World-Bank-experience|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Klitgaard|R. Klitgaard]] raised concerns that falling civil service wages could exacerbate bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1989-04-01|title=Incentive myopia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305750X89902544|journal=World Development|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=447–459|doi=10.1016/0305-750X(89)90254-4|issn=0305-750X|last1=Klitgaard|first1=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low public sector wages have been associated with lower performance and motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1990-07-01|title=Internal adjustments to falling civil service salaries: Insights from Uganda|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305750X90900829|journal=World Development|language=en|volume=18|issue=7|pages=1003–1014|doi=10.1016/0305-750X(90)90082-9|issn=0305-750X|last1=Chew|first1=David C.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salaries below [[opportunity cost]] can induce civil servants to opt for potentially harmful adaptive strategies and seek opportunities for own-account activities. Public officials may ask for compensation through informal or illegal means and these coping strategies compromise the efficiency and honesty of civil service organizations.

Given these arguments, increasing public officials' wages and other employment benefits has been an important aspect of the civil service reform agenda in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.worldbank.org/publicsector/civilservice/mayseminar/Mukherjee.pdf|title=Civil Service Pay and Reward|last=Mukherjee|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic models based on the early work of [[Gary Becker|Becker]] and [[George Stigler|Stigler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|last2=Stigler|first2=George J.|date=1974-01-01|title=Law Enforcement, Malfeasance, and Compensation of Enforcers|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1086/467507|issn=0047-2530}}&lt;/ref&gt; have had a particular influence on the policy debate.

[[Principal–agent problem|Principal-agent]] models of corruption in the civil service provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between public service pay and corruption.  The shirking model ([[Shapiro–Stiglitz theory|Shapiro-Stiglitz]]) is centred on the choice public officials who have the opportunity to be corrupt must make. These [[Rationality|rational]] [[Utility maximization problem|utility-maximizing]] agents decide to engage in [[Moral hazard|morally hazardous]] behaviour based on a [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analysis]] equating the expected returns to corruption ([[Bribery|bribes]]) to the costs of being corrupt (penalties, potential foregone future earnings).&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/do-higher-salaries-lower-petty-corruption-a-policy-experiment-on-west-africa-s-highways|title=Do higher salaries lower petty corruption? A policy experiment on West Africa's highways - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption is detected with a certain probability and is punished by job loss or other penalties. The model predicts that, [[Ceteris paribus|all else equal]], higher wages can deter corruption by increasing the value of behaving honestly. However, when bribes are high and punishment and the probability of detection are low, substantial increases in public official's wages may be required to preempt bribery. Another model explaining bureaucratic corruption, the fair-wage model, makes a distinction between need-based and greed-based corruption. According to this theory, public officials are not necessarily driven by greed but find corruption tempting when their salaries do not allow to meet subsistence levels. 'Fairness' is also determined by other factors, such as the salaries of peers within the civil service, private sector wages, social expectations and the status of civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gong|first=Ting|last2=Wu|first2=Alfred M.|date=2012-10-08|title=Does Increased Civil Service Pay Deter Corruption?: Evidence from China|ssrn=2158530|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of not being paid a fair wage increases corruptibility and also reduces the moral costs of corruption.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klaus|first=Abbink|date=2000|title=Fair Salaries and the Moral Costs of Corruption|url=https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/78377|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model therefore suggests that even modest increases in salaries ensuring 'fair wages' can reduce civil servants' propensity to solicit and accept bribes.

The theoretical linkage between public salary increases and corruption remains ambiguous. In a context of constrained government fiscal resources, the question of [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] to design optimal wage policies arises. A cross-country study by Van Rijckeghem and Weder endeavours to find empirical support for the fair-wage and efficiency wage hypotheses.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/30/Corruption-and-the-Rate-of-Temptation-Do-Low-Wages-in-the-Civil-Service-Cause-Corruption-2246|title=Corruption and the Rate of Temptation : Do Low Wages in the Civil Service Cause Corruption?|website=IMF|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors conclude that relative government wages are negatively and significantly correlated with measures of corruption but that eradicating corruption would necessitate unrealistic increases in relative wages.  These correlations, however, cannot be interpreted as evidence of a causal relationship going from public sector wages to corruption. Causality may run in the [[Reverse causation|reverse]] direction, pervasive corruption has been shown to reduce tax revenue collection and public expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanzi|first=Vito|last2=Davoodi|first2=Hamid R.|date=2000-11-01|title=Corruption, Growth, and Public Finances|ssrn=880260|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor public finance performance and strong budgetary pressures due to corruption may in turn sustain low civil service salaries. This [[Endogeneity (econometrics)|endogeneity]] problem complicates the understanding of the relationship between pay reforms and corruption.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Klaus Abbink also tests the fair salary hypothesis in a laboratory experimental setting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The controlled environment in this experiment allows to isolate and identify the impact of 'fair income' considerations on corrupt behaviour. He finds that public officials in two treatments with different perceptions of 'fairness' behave similarly in a bribery game. In other words, high relative public officials salaries do not alter decisions to be corrupt through fairness considerations. These experimental results substantiate Van Rijckeghem and Weder's findings and cast doubt on the cost-effectiveness of increasing public salaries to combat corruption.

Di Tella and Schargrodsky provide additional evidence with their micro-empirical analysis on wages and [[audit]]ing during a crackdown on corruption in [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires, Argentina]] in 1996-97.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Tella|first=Rafael|last2=Schargrodsky|first2=Ernesto|date=2003-04-01|title=The Role of Wages and Auditing during a Crackdown on Corruption in the City of Buenos Aires|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=46|issue=1|pages=269–292|doi=10.1086/345578|issn=0022-2186}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that wage increases can be effective only when combined with intermediate levels of monitoring intensity (the probability of detection in the shirking model). They test their hypotheses using variations in audit intensity during the crackdown on corruption in public hospitals and find that procurement officers’ wages alone have no statistically significant effect on corruption but detect a negative relationship when wages are interacted with audit intensity. The authors make the case that higher wages and monitoring (“carrots and sticks”) should be used simultaneously to act as an effectual anti-corruption strategy.

The literature on public officials' salaries and corruption offers mixed or inconclusive evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/what-is-the-evidence-of-the-impact-of-increasing-salaries-on-improving-the-performance-of-public-servants-including-teachers-nurses-and-mid-level-occupations-in-low-and-middle-income-countries-is-it-time-to-give-pay-a-chance|title=What is the evidence of the impact of increasing salaries on improving the performance of public servants?

Wage hikes could also have varying effects depending on whether reforms focus on base-salary (unconditional) increases or performance-related pay increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasnain|first=Zahid|last2=Manning|first2=Nick|last3=Pierskalla|first3=Jan Henryk|date=2012|title=Performance-related Pay in the Public Sector: A Review of Theory and Evidence|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6046|journal=World Bank Policy Research Working Papers|language=English|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decentralization ===
Following the dissatisfaction with [[Centralisation|centralized]] forms of [[governance]], decentralization of public service provision to [[Sub-national entity|sub-national]] governments became a global trend, particularly in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=World|date=1999|title=World Development Report 1999/2000|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5982|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Decentralization]] is the transfer of [[authority]], resources and responsibilities from higher to lower levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ombudsman.gov.ph/UNDP4/decentralization-and-power-shift-an-imperative-for-good-governance/index.html|title=Decentralization and Power Shift: An Imperative for Good Governance {{!}} UNDP|website=www.ombudsman.gov.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott and Rao&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/decentralisation-and-local-government/|title=Decentralisation and local government - GSDRC|work=GSDRC|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  distinguish three types of decentralization:

*[[Administration (government)|Administrative]] decentralization refers to the ability of [[local government]]s to hire, fire and set terms of reference for their own employees and on the human resource management and government organization framework.
*Under [[Politics|Political]] or [[Democracy|Democratic]] Decentralization, power is transferred to lower levels of government, public officials are elected by local citizens and are accountable to citizens rather than to the central government.
*[[Fiscal policy|Fiscal]] Decentralization involves assigning responsibilities for [[expenditures]] and [[revenue]]s to local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.worldbank.org/publicsector/decentralization/fiscal.htm|title=Fiscal Decentralization|website=www1.worldbank.org|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of fiscal decentralization varies according to local governments' ability to raise revenues and the extent to which they are given autonomy in allocating their expenditures.

Countries differ in their degree of administrative, political and fiscal decentralization. For instance, in [[China]] there is a devolution of administrative and fiscal responsibilities but no political decentralization whereas it is the opposite in [[India]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardhan|first=Pranab|last2=Mookherjee|first2=Dilip|date=2006|title=Decentralization, Corruption and Government Accountability: An Overview|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/bos/iedwpr/dp-152.html|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several theoretical arguments supporting that decentralization can improve governance and reduce corruption. To begin with, decentralization is believed to bring the government closer to its citizens and to improve the allocation of resources at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azfar|first=O|last2=Kähkönen|first2=S|last3=Lanyi|first3=A|last4=Meagher|first4=P|last5=Rutherford|first5=Diana|date=2004-01-01|title=Decentralization, Governance and Public Services: The Impact of Institutional Arrangements|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230557423|journal=Devolution and Development: Governance Prospects in Decentralizing States|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optimal output level of a local public good (at which citizens' [[Marginal utility|marginal benefit]] equals [[marginal cost]] of providing the good) varies across localities because of differences in preferences and costs. Considering that sub-national governments have better information about the preferences and circumstances of their constituencies, they can tailor the provision of public goods according to these preferences, thereby increasing efficiency and total welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oates|first=Wallace E|date=1999|title=An Essay on Fiscal Federalism|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|language=en|volume=37|issue=3|pages=1120–1149|doi=10.1257/jel.37.3.1120|issn=0022-0515|citeseerx=10.1.1.195.449}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea goes back to [[Friedrich Hayek|F. Hayek's]] argument in his essay "[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]" (1945). Hayek asserts that since knowledge is decentralized ("the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayek|first=F. A.|date=1945|title=The Use of Knowledge in Society|jstor=1809376|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=35|issue=4|pages=519–530}}&lt;/ref&gt; it follows that decisions and control over resources should be decentralized (a necessary although not sufficient condition for achieving optimal allocation).

However, [[Principal–agent problem|principal-agent models]] demonstrate there can be tradeoffs in transferring [[decision-making]] responsibilities. Under these theoretical frameworks, central public officials are assumed to be public-spirited principals and local officials act as self-interested agents. On the one hand, [[public good]] delivery can be better adapted to local needs but on the other hand, the decisions are made by [[Principal–agent problem|agents]] whose interests differ from the [[Principal–agent problem|principal]]. Delegating [[authority]] can result in 'control loss' or 'abuse of power'. Decentralization can be more effective than centralized decision-making if the gains from adaptability can outweigh the control loss. The overall effects of decentralization on governance and [[welfare]] will therefore depend on the degree to which the principal's and agent's interests are opposed and the principal's ability to exert control over the agent's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melumad|first=Nahum|last2=Mookherjee|first2=Dilip|last3=Reichelstein|first3=Stefan|date=1997-06-01|title=Contract Complexity, Incentives, and the Value of Delegation |journal=Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=257–289|doi=10.1111/j.1430-9134.1997.00257.x|issn=1530-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that decentralization can enhance accountability in the service delivery mechanism. Local governments' proximity makes it more feasible for citizens to monitor and hold public officials accountable. The accountability mechanisms work through political decentralization. In a functional local democracy, local elections constitute an 'incomplete contract' enabling citizens to remove non-performing local officials from office.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, as Bardhan and Mookherjee argue, local democracy may not operate effectively in practice in developing countries and may be captured by local elites.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardhan|first=Pranab|last2=Mookherjee|first2=Dilip|date=2000|title=Corruption and Decentralization of Infrastructure Delivery in Developing Countries|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/bosecd/104.html|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, decentralization can reduce corruption by creating horizontal competition between local governments. [[Tiebout model|Tiebout]] make the case in a 1956 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiebout|first=Charles M.|date=1956-10-01|title=A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=64|issue=5|pages=416–424|doi=10.1086/257839|issn=0022-3808}}&lt;/ref&gt; that residents' and factors of production's mobility across localities can reduce the monopoly power exercised by local public officials with respect to regulations and bribes. Fiscal and political decentralization encourages inter-jurisdictional competition that pressures sub-national governments to efficiently deliver local public goods. If citizens are dissatisfied with their local government's performance, they can move to other regions, thereby decreasing tax revenues in less efficient jurisdictions. A similar argument concerning the relationship between a decentralized bureaucratic structure and bribe payments has been explored in the academic literature. [[Susan Rose-Ackerman|Rose-Ackerman]] suggests that a decentralized civil service can reduce bribery since [[competition]] between public officials would bid down bribe payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RVa0BQAAQBAJ|title=Corruption: A Study in Political Economy|last=Rose-Ackerman|first=Susan|date=2013-10-22|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9781483289069|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishny and Shleifer further develop this argument, they build a model where citizens and businesses require more than one service or good from several public officials. If government services are substitutes, then the competitive regime still applies. However, when government services are complementary and in the case of a decentralized bureaucratic structure, firms or citizens are facing several independent bureaucrats. Decentralization might therefore lead to a lack of coordination among bribe-seeking bureaucrats and a "[[Tragedy of the commons|Tragedy of the Commons]]" outcome where public officials ask bribe payments that are too high, thereby increasing the burden that corruption imposes on firms and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shleifer|first=A.|last2=Vishny|first2=R. W.|date=1993-08-01|title=Corruption|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/108/3/599/1881822?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=108|issue=3|pages=599–617|doi=10.2307/2118402|issn=0033-5533|jstor=2118402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diaby and Sylwester empirically test these hypotheses in a cross-country regression and find that bribe payments are higher under a more decentralized bureaucratic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-09-01|title=Bureaucratic competition and public corruption: Evidence from transition countries|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268014000408|journal=European Journal of Political Economy|language=en|volume=35|pages=75–87|doi=10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2014.04.002|issn=0176-2680|last1=Diaby|first1=Aboubacar|last2=Sylwester|first2=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Fisman and Gatti detect a strong negative correlation between fiscal decentralization (as measured by subnational share of total government spending) and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raymond|first=Fisman|last2=Roberta|first2=Gatti|date=2000|title=Decentralization and Corruption : Evidence across Countries|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/19852|journal=|language=en-US|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treisman (2000) examines correlations between eight different measures of decentralization with various measures of corruption and service delivery performance. The same measure of fiscal decentralization used by Fisman and Gatti appears not to be significantly correlated with corruption measures.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/2000|title=Decentralization and the Quality of Government|last=Treisman|first=Daniel|date=2000|website=www.imf.org|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decentralization is a complex process which manifests itself in various forms. The design and impetus for decentralization are specific to each country, which complicates comparisons of a single conception of decentralization. The literature on decentralization experiences in several developing countries suggests the effects of decentralization on public sector performance and corruption are likely to be ambiguous and highly context-specific.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The empirical work appears to be inconclusive as various types of decentralization were examined using different measures. What's more, measuring corruption as bribery without paying attention to special interest [[Elite capture|capture]] may provide an inaccurate assessment of the impact of decentralization. As Bardhan and Mookherjee argue, bribery may decrease while being replaced by local elite capture as a result of decentralization.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Treisman purports that the theoretical and empirical arguments about decentralization and governance refer to specific types of decentralization. He identifies five types: structural, decision, resource, electoral and institutional decentralization and develops arguments clarifying how each type affects the quality of government.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; While some types of decentralization can improve governance and reduce corruption, others can undermine government performance, this can in part explain the mixed empirical evidence on the effects of decentralization.

=== Top-Down Performance Monitoring ===
Rather than structuring rewards and penalties for corrupt behaviour, another approach to civil service reform seeks to increase the probability that corrupt activity will be observed. Theoretically,  monitoring can reduce [[Information asymmetry|information asymmetries]] so that the principal can induce the agent to choose the optimal level of effort and the optimal degree of corrupt activity. As the agent compares his expected payoff of being honest to that of being corrupt, increasing the probability of getting caught and punished will deter corrupt behaviour.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520074088|title=Controlling Corruption|last=Klitgaard|first=Robert|publisher=University of California Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Chapter 3: Policy Measures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil service auditing by the principal or third parties serves an [[accountability]] function. The inherent conflict of interest as well as the lack of oversight require independent third parties to certify the reliability of financial reporting, performance results and compliance to rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://na.theiia.org/standards-guidance/leading-practices/Pages/the-role-of-auditing-in-public-sector-governance.aspx|title=The Role of Auditing in Public Sector Governance|last=|first=|date=|website=na.theiia.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditors can help exercise oversight by evaluating the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the delivery of government services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/33Performanceauditing.pdf|title=Public Sector Performance Auditing in Developing Countries|last=Warring|first=Colleen|last2=Morgan|first2=Stephen|date=2009|website=|access-date=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[audit]]s must rely on efficiency measures and pre-determined criteria and benchmarks to assess public servant's performance and the impact of government's programs. Performance auditing can also help detect corruption in public entities. Audits highlight irregularities and areas of inefficiencies that may indicate the existence of corruption. Based on suspicious circumstances, auditors can identify illegal behaviour and collect evidence on misdeeds which can subsequently be used to prosecute public servants at fault. As previously mentioned, successful detection efforts by performance auditing can have a deterrent effect on corrupt activities.

Auditing and prosecution were important elements in Justice Plana's campaign to curb corruption in the Bureau of Internal Revenue in the Philippines. Appointed as the new Commissioner of the corrupt Bureau of Internal Revenue, Justice Plana's anti-corruption strategy focused on implementing a new performance evaluation system, gathering information on corruption through intelligence agents and audits and effectively prosecuting corrupt tax officers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; While Justice Plana's campaign was a multi-faceted approach, the higher monitoring intensity combined with a highly credible threat of punishment were particularly successful in deterring corrupt behaviour in the Bureau of Internal Revenue. According to Professor Magtolis-Briones, the threat of being detected and prosecuted decidedly lead officials to reconsider their decisions to engage in corrupt activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lynchlibrary.pssc.org.ph:8081/bitstream/handle/0/4711/07_Negative%20Bureaucratic%20Behavior%20and%20Development.pdf?sequence=1|title=Negative Bureaucratic Behaviour and Development:The Case of the Bureau of Internal Revenue|last=Magtolis-Briones|first=Leonor|date=1979|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Georgia, the success of anti-corruption reforms especially relied on top-down monitoring and prosecution but Schueth warns about the potential abuses of monitoring when fighting corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-03-01|title=Apparatus of capture: Fiscal state formation in the republic of Georgia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629811001880|journal=Political Geography|language=en|volume=31|issue=3|pages=133–143|doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2011.11.004|issn=0962-6298|last1=Schueth|first1=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crackdown on corruption in the tax agency involved coercion such as the use of extra-legal surveillance systems to ensure public officials' observance of the new procedural codes.

Laboratory experiments provide evidence on the impact monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-12-01|title=A controlled field experiment on corruption|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292111000389|journal=European Economic Review|language=en|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1072–1082|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2011.04.007|issn=0014-2921|last1=Armantier|first1=Olivier|last2=Boly|first2=Amadou}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a controlled bribery experiment in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, Armantier and Boly observed that monitoring and punishment can be an effective anti-corruption policy. The researchers had two treatments, low monitoring and high monitoring.While the 'low monitoring' treatment proved effective in curbing bribery, they could not detect significant treatment effects on bribery in the 'high monitoring' treatment. The authors suggest that high monitoring intensity can crowd out intrinsic motivations to behave honestly.

Serra compare the effectiveness of top-down and bottom-up monitoring in a laboratory bribery game between public officials and private citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Serra|first=D.|date=2011-06-09|title=Combining Top-Down and Bottom-Up Accountability: Evidence from a Bribery Experiment|url=https://academic.oup.com/jleo/article-abstract/28/3/569/909949|journal=Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=569–587|doi=10.1093/jleo/ewr010|issn=8756-6222|citeseerx=10.1.1.594.1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental results suggest that top-down auditing is ineffective in deterring bribery, this may be especially true in weak institutional environments. However, the researcher found that combining formal top-down auditing and bottom-up monitoring created an accountability mechanism that was effective in curbing corruption.

=== Bottom-Up Monitoring and Reforms ===
An alternative approach to improving governance and combating corruption that has gained prominence in recent years is encouraging grassroots participation by community members in local monitoring to induce bottom-up pressures for reform. The 2004 World Development Report: Making Services Work for Poor People&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=The World|date=2003-09-30|title=World Development Report 2004 : Making services work for poor people - Overview|pages=1–36|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/527371468166770790/World-Development-Report-2004-Making-services-work-for-poor-people-Overview|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is centred on this grassroots approach to development. Community participation is now considered an important component of reforms aiming to improve public service delivery and corruption at the local level.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Olken |first=Benjamin |title=Monitoring Corruption: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Indonesia |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=115 |issue=2 |year=2007 |pages=200–249 |doi=10.1086/517935 |citeseerx=10.1.1.144.6583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottom-up models of governance involve community members participating in the service provision process by allowing them to monitor public officials, to have a say in policymaking, and keep service providers accountable to incentivize them to deliver public goods and services efficiently.

[[Joseph Stiglitz|J. Stiglitz]] argues that community members, as beneficiaries of public goods and services, will have more incentives to monitor and ensure that governments programs are successful compared to indifferent central bureaucrats. In particular, project involving local citizens will be more likely to succeed since community participation helps sustain efforts towards the long-term continuation of projects necessary to keep them effective.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|date=2002|title=Participation and Development: Perspectives from the Comprehensive Development Paradigm|journal=Review of Development Economics|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=163–182|doi=10.1111/1467-9361.00148|issn=1363-6669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, [[Benjamin Olken|B. Olken]] contends that grassroots monitoring for public goods and services may be impaired by a free-rider problem&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; and suggests that government provision of private goods (subsidized food or health care) may generate more incentives to monitor service provision as each community member has a personal interest in securing the effective delivery of goods and in minimizing extortion by public officials. Stiglitz indeed recognizes that grassroots monitoring of public good delivery is in itself a public good and that as such, it is under-provided.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

A bottom-up project, the Citizen Report Card (CRC), pioneered by the NGO [[Public Affairs Centre India|Public Affairs Center]] (PAC) was implemented in 1993 in [[Bangalore]], [[India]]. This project aimed at gathering local citizens' feedback on civil service performance and publicizing the results through the media, thereby exerting public pressures for the public service to improve its performance and launch reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adikeshavalu|first=Ravindra|date=2004-06-01|title=An assessment of the impact of Bangalore citizen report cards on the performance of public agencies|pages=1–25|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/777451468752769088/An-assessment-of-the-impact-of-Bangalore-citizen-report-cards-on-the-performance-of-public-agencies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the report cards revealed low levels of citizens' satisfaction with service providers, and the expectation was that report cards would serve as an accountability mechanism that would bring forward issues of service provision quality and corruption levels in the public service. While this initiative did raise awareness on such issues, there was some but not dramatic improvement in service delivery quality between 1994 and 1999. However, the difficulty of measuring improvements in service quality other than through subjective measures restricts opportunities to rigorously evaluate this bottom-up initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website01004/WEB/IMAGES/10850832.PDF|title=Making Voices: The Report Card on Bangalore's Public Services|last=Paul|first=Samuel|date=|website=|publisher=Public Affairs Center, Bangalore, India|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Participatory budgeting|Participatory Budgeting]] in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]] is known among scholars and policymakers as an enduring example of bottom-up reforms.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Participatory-budgeting-of-Porto-Alegre:-a-in-the-Utzig/b8f09942a1c783728ff4a76e16a37deca2f11998|title=Participatory budgeting of Porto Alegre: a discussion in the light of the principle of democratic legitimacy and of the criterion of governance performance - Semantic Scholar|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory budgeting allows citizens to voice their demands regarding service delivery improvements, and through negotiations to influence budget funds allocation at the municipality level. This project was initiated in 1989, and is said to have improved access to and the quality of public service provision, especially for lower segments of society.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; For instance, 27,000 new public housing units were created in 1989 (compared to only 1,700 in 1986), the number of schools quadrupled between 1986 and 1997 while the share of Porto Alegre's budget going to education and health went from 13% in 1985 to about 40% in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEMPOWERMENT/Resources/14657_Partic-Budg-Brazil-web.pdf|title=Participatory Budgeting in Brazil|last=Bhatnagar et al.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory budgeting still has to address some limitations, including lack of representation of the poorest, but its success has led other municipalities in Brazil and public entities in other countries to adopt this initiative.

== Evidence on Reform Effectiveness in Developing Countries ==

=== Pay Reforms Experiences ===

==== Base Salary Increases for Police Officers in Ghana ====
In 2010, the Ghanaian government implemented a civil service salary reform, the Single Spine Salary Structure (SSSS) to mitigate pay disparities in the public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=D.|first=Larbi, M.|title=The Implementation of the Single Spine Salary Structure (Ssss) in Ghana|date=2007|degree=|publisher=University of Ghana|url=http://ugspace.ug.edu.gh/handle/123456789/8394|doi=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Police officer]]s were the first beneficiaries of this new salary structure as the police service has historically been the least well-paid of public services in [[Ghana]]. Their wages unilaterally doubled in an attempt to increase their [[Standard of living|living standards]] to reduce [[bribery]] (fair-wage hypothesis). Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang assess the impact of this salary reform using a [[Difference in differences|difference-in-difference]] analysis taking advantage of the exogenous change induced by the policy.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

While police officers' wages doubled, the salaries of other civil servants in Ghana and police officers in [[Burkina Faso]] stayed the same. The researchers identified two groups, the Ghanaian policemen who received the treatment (higher wages) and the control group consisting of other civil servants (Ghanaian custom officers and Burkinabé policemen) whose wages did not increase.

Using data on bribes paid from 2,100 truck trips between Ghana and Burkina Faso,  Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang can observe the differences in interactions with truck drivers between the treated and the control group before the salary reform (2006-2010) and after the salary reform (2010-2012). If we assume group differences would have stayed constant in the absence of the reform ([[Difference in differences#Assumptions|parallel trend assumption]]), the difference-in-difference coefficient estimate measures the causal impact of the salary increase on Ghanaian police officers' propensity to ask for bribes. The results suggest that the salary reform counterintuively increased police officers' efforts to extort bribes, the value of the bribes and the total amount truck drivers had to pay on the road.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This evidence goes against theoretical arguments on pay reforms in the civil service. Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang posit that these results could be due to the lack of enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Without changing the environment and other incentives facing civil servants, it appears that increasing wages may not have the predicted effects on corruption.

==== Pay for Performance Reforms for Tax Collectors in Pakistan ====
Corruption in tax administration has particularly detrimental effects on tax revenue collection, fiscal balance and overall economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ajaz|first=Tahseen|last2=Ahmad|first2=Eatzaz|date=2010|title=The Effect of Corruption and Governance on Tax Revenues|jstor=41428665|journal=The Pakistan Development Review|volume=49|issue=4|pages=405–417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan, Khwaja and Olken implemented a large-scale randomized experiment in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]] to assess the impact of performance-based payment schemes for tax collectors.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Adnan Q. |last=Khan |first2=Asim I. |last2=Khwaja |first3=Benjamin A. |last3=Olken |year=2016 |title=Tax Farming Redux: Experimental Evidence on Performance Pay for Tax Collectors |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=219–271 |doi=10.1093/qje/qjv042 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/66265/1/Khan_Tax%20farming%20redux_2016.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with the Punjab provincial government, they randomly allocated tax officials in the provincial urban property tax department into four groups, a control group and three treatment groups corresponding to different pay-for-performance designs.

The three treatment groups differed in the degree to which tax officers' pay was based on revenue collection performance and on other subjective evaluations from taxpayers and the tax department. The 'Revenue' treatment provided incentives depending only on revenue collection exceeding a benchmark while the 'Revenue Plus' scheme tied salaries to tax collection performance as well as accuracy of tax assessment and taxpayers' satisfaction. The last treatment 'Flexible Plus' added several criteria set by the tax department to determine wages. After two fiscal years, Khan, Khwaja and Olken found that across the three treatment groups, tax revenues increased by 9 log points on average which is equivalent to 46% higher growth of revenues compared to the control group.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The 'Revenue' scheme was the most effective in increasing tax collection but the researchers found no effects on accuracy of tax assessment or the satisfaction of taxpayers. They note that pay-for-performance schemes may have tradeoffs: giving excessive incentives to tax officers might increase their bargaining power with taxpayers and lead to more extortion and taxpayers' dissatisfaction. However, Khan, Khwaja and Olken point out that the benefits of pay-for-performance contracts outweigh their costs and suggest they can effective in increasing tax revenue collection.

=== Monitoring Reforms ===

==== Random Audits in Brazilian Municipalities ====
In 2003, the federal government of Brazil created the [[Comptroller General of Brazil|Controladoria Geral da União]] (CGU) charged with corruption prevention and internal control. The CGU launched an anti-corruption program, Programa de Fiscalização por Sorteios Públicos (Monitoring Program with Public Lotteries), which consists in randomly selecting municipalities for audits and publicly disseminating the findings. As of 2015, 12 years after the beginning of the reform, there have been 2,241 audits in 1,949 municipalities.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Avis |first=Eric |last2=Ferraz |first2=Claudio |last3=Finan |first3=Frederico |date=July 2016 |title=Do Government Audits Reduce Corruption? Estimating the Impacts of Exposing Corrupt Politicians |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 22443 |doi=10.3386/w22443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers Avis, Ferraz and Finan exploited the random selection to measure the impact of this anti-corruption program. While some municipalities had been audited several times in the past (treatment group), others were being audited for the first time (control group). Since the municipalities were randomly selected, comparing corruption levels among municipalities in the control and treatment group can provide causal estimates of the effects of the reform.

Based on audit reports, they estimate that 30% of the federal funds transferred to municipalities were stolen. However, they find that corruption levels were 8% lower in municipalities that had previously undergone government audits, thereby suggesting that random audits can be an effective policy against corruption. The researchers posit that random audits can reduce corruption by increasing public officials' perceived probability of being detected. They observed that audits also generated spillover effects, neighbouring municipalities were also affected, having an additional neighbour audited decreased their corruption levels by 7.5%.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The local media played a role in disseminating information about other municipalities' audit outcomes.

Avis et al. identify several mechanisms through which the audits led to lower local corruption. First, the new program introduce a system of political accountability whereby local citizens can punish or reward (dis)honest incumbents. Audits may have also altered the types of candidates who enter into politics. What's more, negative audit results can generate reputational costs and potential legal punishments.

==== Monitoring a Road Building Project in Indonesia ====
The Kecamatan Development Project (KDP) is an Indonesian government program, financed by the World Bank which funds village-level small-scale infrastructure programs. [[Benjamin Olken]] implemented a randomized experiment in which he randomly assigned 608 villages into groups with different audit probabilities prior to the start of a nationwide infrastructure project.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

A random sample of villages were informed that the project would be audited by an audit agency once completed. This increased the probability of detection from 4% to 100%. The audit results were publicly disseminated by the auditors during village meetings. Olken also designed experiments to increase local members' participation in 'accountability meetings' where officials in charge of the road-building project expose how the budget will be spent.

To assess the impact of both monitoring mechanisms, the researcher uses a quantitative measure of corruption levels based on engineers' assessment of the quantity of materials used to build the roads and estimated costs. The discrepancies between project’s official costs reported by village project leaders and the costs estimated by independent engineers measures missing expenditures which are used as a proxy for corruption in Olken's study. It was estimated that on average 24% of materials were missing based on road samples, suggesting that part of the project funds were diverted. Olken finds that increasing the probability of external audits significantly reduced missing expenditures (by 8%), and that this approach to fighting corruption is cost-effective.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; Top-down audits were more effective when village elections were close, which implies that local level accountability can be effective in restraining corrupt behaviour. However, the interventions to increase grassroots participation did not have any significant effects on missing funds.

== Challenges and Barriers to Effective Civil Service Reforms ==
[[Political economy]] dynamics condition the success of civil service reforms. [[Douglass North|North]] et al. argue that some developing countries function as 'limited access orders' in which [[elite]]s exclude broad cross-sections of society to maintain an equilibrium that enables them to extracts rents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Douglass C.|last2=Wallis|first2=John Joseph|last3=Webb|first3=Steven B.|last4=Weingast|first4=Barry R.|date=2007-11-09|title=Limited Access Orders In The Developing World :A New Approach To The Problems Of Development|journal=Policy Research Working Papers|language=en|doi=10.1596/1813-9450-4359|issn=1813-9450}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such an equilibrium, political elites have no incentives to break down their patronage networks and introduce [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] recruitment reforms in the civil service as it would threaten their position and reduce their opportunities for [[rent-seeking]]. The [[Clientelism|clientelist]] system on the contrary can be a powerful mechanism through which elites maintain this 'limited access order'. Considerably depending on clientelist and [[patronage]] networks increases the costs of implementing public sector reforms. Elites will therefore be likely to oppose reforms as they stand to lose the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geddes|first=Barbara|date=1991|title=A Game Theoretic Model of Reform in Latin American Democracies|jstor=1963165|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=85|issue=2|pages=371–392|doi=10.2307/1963165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What's more, civil service reforms are costly to implement in the short-term while their benefits will be manifested and reaped in the future. Governments are thus unwilling to make such unappealing investment. The long-term nature of reforms and the reluctance to initiate, gather and maintain support for reforms prevent their implementation in the first place. In a background paper for the 2011 World Bank Development Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lant|first=Pritchett|last2=Frauke|first2=de Weijer|date=2011|title=Fragile States : Stuck in a Capability Trap?|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/9109|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Weijer and Pritchett appraise that it would take about 20 years to witness improvements in the functional capability of the state. In almost every countries, this exceeds the average duration of a term of office, political incumbents would have no incentives to incur the costs to carry out reforms while the benefits will accrue to future incumbents.

In addition, bureaucratic inertia and resistance to change should not be overlooked. Bureaucrats may be disinclined to accept changes brought by civil service reforms. This is especially true in countries where bureaucrats depend on informal or illegal channels to complement their meager salaries.&lt;ref name=":142"/&gt;

Institutional structures or types of political regimes also matter for reform implementation and success. In a democratic regime, political incumbents may see it in their interests to initiate bureaucratic reforms if voters value and acknowledge the public benefits of reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/corruption-and-government/domestic-conditions-for-reform/8B269276F411CD2BA57F1F87E534D02E|title=Domestic Conditions for Reform (Chapter 13) - Corruption and Government|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, demand for civil service reforms remains weak in developing countries. Even if bureaucratic corruption is condemned across countries, the internal demand for anti-corruption reforms is undermined by a [[collective action problem]]. Indeed, Persson, Rohstein and Teorell argue that civil service reforms have failed as a result of their mischaracterization of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persson|first=Anna|last2=Rothstein|first2=Bo|last3=Teorell|first3=Jan|date=2012-09-07|title=Why Anticorruption Reforms Fail-Systemic Corruption as a Collective Action Problem|journal=Governance|language=en|volume=26|issue=3|pages=449–471|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01604.x|issn=0952-1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most approaches to civil service reform rely on principal-agent frameworks that assume that 'principled principals' are public-spirited and will always take on the task to fight corruption and improve bureaucratic performance. However, the authors contend that, in contexts where corruption is pervasive, actors will not necessarily respond to incentives aiming at altering their behaviour but instead behave based on the extent to which corruption is the expected behaviour in society.

He is also an instructor who teaches comic book storytelling at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in Manhattan.

==Career==
Mazzucchelli received his [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] from the [[Rhode Island School of Design]],&lt;ref name=SVA&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sva.edu/faculty/david-mazzucchelli|title= Our Faculty: David Mazzuchelli|publisher= [[School of Visual Arts]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121023131205/http://www.sva.edu/faculty/david-mazzucchelli|archivedate= October 23, 2012|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all|accessdate= July 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wittyworld.com/whoswho/whoswho-M.html|title= Mazzuchelli, David|publisher= International Who is Who in Cartooning|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120204164557/http://www.wittyworld.com/whoswho/whoswho-M.html|archivedate= February 4, 2012|deadurl= yes|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started working in comics in the early 1980s, first at [[Marvel Comics]] where, after a few fill-in jobs, he became the regular artist on ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb|type=credit|search= David+Mazzucchelli|title= David Mazzucchelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with writer [[Dennis O'Neil|Denny O'Neil]] and culminated his work on this title with the ''[[Daredevil: Born Again]]'' story arc, written by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page= 226|isbn= 978-0756641238|quote= 'Born Again' was a seven-issue story arc that appeared in ''Daredevil'' from issue #227 to #233 (Feb.–Aug. 1986) by writer Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller and Mazzucchelli collaborated again on the graphic novel  ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', serialized in issues #404–407 of [[DC Comics]]' monthly ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' title, and published in a single volume shortly afterwards. ''Batman: Year One'' is considered one of the best Batman stories ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010 |location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 227 |quote =  Melding Miller's noir sensibilities, realistic characterization, and gritty action with Mazzucchelli's brilliant iconic imagery, "Year One" thrilled readers and critics alike...as well as being one of the influences for the 2005 film ''Batman Begins''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mazzucchelli had previously worked on Batman in a five page backup story in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #302 (April 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dougall|first2=Alastair, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title= Batman: A Visual History|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2014|location= London, United Kingdom|page= 150|isbn= 978-1465424563|quote= A rare early example of Mazzucchelli's Batman before his ground-breaking 'Batman: Year One' story in February 1987, this tale featured Superman and Batman doing something quite out of the ordinary for the duo: having a drink at a local bar.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Batman: Year One'', Mazzucchelli drew an [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] story in ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #40 (Oct. 1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Trumbull|first= John|title= '''Marvel Fanfare'' #40: Fallen Angels and Stormy Weather|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 96|pages= 64–65|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= June 2017|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved on to focus on more personal projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Young|first = Frank |title = Comics Used to be about Telling Stories: David Mazzucchelli Discusses his Transition from Mainstream to Independence|journal = [[The Comics Journal]]|issue = 152|pages = 114–199|publisher = [[Fantagraphics Books]]|date = August 1992|location= Seattle, Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published three issues of his own independent anthology, ''[[Rubber Blanket]]'', co-edited by his wife, painter [[Richmond Lewis]], in which he began finding his voice as a writer in addition to exploring new avenues of visual expression. His evocative and haunting stories in ''Rubber Blanket'', notably "Near Miss," "Dead Dog," "Discovering America," and "Big Man," set the stage for his work to come.  With writer/artist [[Paul Karasik]], he co-wrote and illustrated an adaptation of [[Paul Auster]]'s ''[[The New York Trilogy|City of Glass]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.indyworld.com/indy/spring_2004/mazzucchelli_interview/|title= Three Questions for David Mazzucchelli|first= Bill|last= Kartalopoulos|date= Spring 2004|publisher= ''Indy Magazine''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130614172447/http://www.indyworld.com/indy/spring_2004/mazzucchelli_interview/|archivedate= June 14, 2013|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; published first by Avon Books in 1994, then by Picador in 2004 as ''[[City of Glass: The Graphic Novel]]''. Auster's later book ''[[The Brooklyn Follies]]'' features a character with the name Nancy Mazzucchelli, an homage to David. He continued to write and draw short comics for various publishers until 2000. Mazzucchelli was one of the artists on the ''[[Superman and Batman: World's Funnest]]'' one-shot written by [[Evan Dorkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=6999|title= Evan Dorkin Debuts ''World's Funnest''|first= Beau|last= Yarbrough|date= March 18, 1999|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905230641/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=6999|archivedate= September 5, 2015|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Pantheon Books]] published Mazzucchelli's graphic novel, ''[[Asterios Polyp]]''.

Mazzucchelli has also done illustrations for various publications, including interior pieces and covers for ''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;ref name="Lambiek" /&gt; In 2011, an [[Batman: Year One (film)|animated adaptation]] of ''Batman: Year One'' was released by [[Warner Home Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-year-one-lines-up-179942 |title= ''Batman: Year One'' Lines Up Voice Cast, Sets Comic-Con Premiere|last= Kit|first= Borys|date= April 20, 2011|publisher= ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''|accessdate=June 18, 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721213402/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-year-one-lines-up-179942|archivedate= July 21, 2011|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diane F. Halpern''' is an American [[psychology|psychologist]] and former president of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA). She is Dean of Social Science at the [[Minerva Schools at KGI]] ([[Keck Graduate Institute]]) and also the McElwee Family Professor of Psychology at [[Claremont McKenna College]]. She is also past-president of the Western Psychological Association, The Society for the Teaching of Psychology, and the Division of General Psychology.

Halpern served on boards and panels at the APA including the Board of Educational Affairs, the Council of Representatives, the Committee on International Relations in Psychology, the Committee on Learning Outcomes, and Teachers of Psychology in Secondary Schools. She chaired the Panel on Public Policy and APA's National Conference on Undergraduate Education that resulted in the publication ''Undergraduate Education in Psychology: A Blueprint for the Future of the Discipline''.

Along with Keith Millis (Northern Illinois University) and [[Arthur C. Graesser]] (University of Memphis), Halpern developed Operation ARA, a computerized game that teaches scientific reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Operation ARA: A computerized learning game that teaches critical thinking and scientific reasoning.|journal=Thinking Skills and Creativity|year=2012|volume=7|issue=2|pages=93–100|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187112000235|doi=10.1016/j.tsc.2012.03.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also developed the Halpern Critical Thinking Assessment (Schuhfried Publishers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HCTA Halpern Critical Thinking Assessment|url=http://www.schuhfried.com/viennatestsystem10/tests-test-sets/all-tests-from-a-z/test/hcta-halpern-critical-thinking-assessment-1/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215150538/http://www.schuhfried.com/viennatestsystem10/tests-test-sets/all-tests-from-a-z/test/hcta-halpern-critical-thinking-assessment-1|archivedate=2013-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that uses multiple response formats which allow test-takers to demonstrate their ability to think about everyday topics using both constructed response and recognition formats.

Halpern received her B.A. from [[University of Pennsylvania]] and an M.A. from [[Temple University]]. She then received an M.A., from [[University of Cincinnati]], followed by a Ph.D. from that institution in 1979. After teaching for many years at the [[California State University, San Bernardino]], she is currently Professor of Psychology at [[Claremont McKenna College]].

In 1995, Halpern was part of an 11-member APA task force led by [[Ulric Neisser]] which published ''[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]'', a report written in response to ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. She has also written on cognitive differences between men and women. She suggests a biopsychosocial model offers superior insight into cognitive sex differences than a simple nature-vs-nurture dichotomy. Another topic of her research is risks associated with [[left-handedness]].&lt;ref name="reuters1991"&gt;Reuters (April 4, 1991). [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/04/us/being-left-handed-may-be-dangerous-to-life-study-says.html Being Left-Handed May Be Dangerous To Life, Study Says.] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Halpern has also written in opposition of single-sex schooling, noting that it "lacks scientific support and may exaggerate sexism and gender stereotyping."&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;Science (September 23, 2011). [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6050/1706 The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Schooling.] ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''didactic method''' ({{lang-el|διδάσκειν}} ''didáskein'', "to teach") is a [[teaching method]] that follows a consistent scientific approach or educational style to present information to students. The didactic method of instruction is often contrasted with [[dialectics]] and the [[Socratic method]]; the term can also be used to refer to a specific didactic method, as for instance [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivist didactics]].

==Overview==
Didactics is a theory of teaching, and in a wider sense, a theory and practical application of [[teaching]] and [[learning]]. In demarcation from "[[mathetics]]" (the science of learning), didactics refers only to the science of teaching.

This theory might be contrasted with [[open learning]], also known as [[experiential learning]], in which people can learn by themselves, in an unstructured manner, on topics of interest.

The theory of didactic learning methods focuses on the baseline knowledge students possess and seeks to improve upon and convey this information. It also refers to the foundation or starting point in a lesson plan, where the overall goal is knowledge. A teacher or educator functions in this role as an authoritative figure, but also as both a guide and a resource for students.

Didactics or the didactic method have different connotations in continental Europe and English speaking countries {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. For the Anglo-Saxon tradition {{who?|date=October 2016}}, the didactic method still carries the original meaning of teaching moral contents, and is therefore associated with unfavourable views opposed to the teachings of a true art or science {{clarification needed|date=October 2016}}. The [[Oxford dictionary]] merely defines didactics as a particularly moral instruction {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. [[Didacticism]] was indeed the cultural origin of the didactic method but refers within its narrow context usually pejoratively to the use of language to a doctrinal end. The interpretation of these opposing views are theorised to be the result of a differential cultural development in the 19th century when Great Britain and its former colonies went through a renewal and increased cultural distancing from [[continental Europe]]. It was particularly the later appearance of [[Romanticism]] and [[Aestheticism]] in the Anglo-Saxon world which offered these negative and limiting views of the didactic method. In continental Europe those moralising aspects of didactics were removed earlier by cultural representatives of the [[age of enlightenment]], such as [[Voltaire]], [[Rousseau]], and later specifically related to teaching by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]].

The consequences of these cultural differences then created two main didactic traditions: The Anglo-Saxon tradition of [[curriculum studies]] on one side and the Continental and North European tradition of didactics on the other. Still today, the science of didactics carries much less weight in much of the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/didactic Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms] Retrieved 27 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of globalisation at the beginning of the 20th century, however, the arguments for such relative philosophical aspects in the methods of teaching started to diminish somewhat. It is therefore possible to categorise didactics and pedagogy as a general analytic theory on three levels:&lt;ref&gt;Gundem and Hopmann (1998).

==Didactic teaching==
Didactic method provides students with the required theoretical knowledge.&lt;ref name="Garavan1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas N.

The teacher or the literate is the source of knowledge and the knowledge is transmitted to the students through didactic method.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite web|title=criticalthinking|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org/data/pages/29/159e33cd3add1bb75c1f848a06a80d37519cf2e476776.pdf|website=www.criticalthinking.org|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montessori school had preplanned teaching (Didactic) materials designed, to develop practical, sensory, and formal skills. Lacing and buttoning frames, weights, and packet to be identified by their sound or smell. Because they direct learning in the prepared environment, Montessori educators are called directress rather than teachers.

===Functions of didactic method===
* cognitive function:  to understand and learn basic concepts
* formative-educative  function: to develop skills, behavior, abilities, etc.
* instrumental function : to achieve educational objectives
*  normative function : helps to achieve productive learning,  attain required results, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Didactic method and Didactic proceeding |url=http://www.educativ.info/edu/licee5.html |website=Education in Moldova |accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Method of teaching===
In didactic method of teaching, the teacher gives instructions to the students and the students are mostly passive listeners. It is a teacher-centered method of teaching and is content oriented. The content or knowledge of the teacher is not questioned.

The process of teaching involves the teacher who gives instructions, commands, delivers content, and provides necessary information. The pupil activity involves listening and memorization of the content. In the modern education system, lecture method which is one of the most commonly used methods is a form of didactic teaching.

===Limitations===
Though the didactic method has been given importance in several schools, it does not satisfy the needs and interests of all students. It can be tedious for students to listen to the possible lectures. There is minimum interaction between the students and the teachers. Learning which also involves motivating the students to develop an interest towards the subject may not be satisfied through this teaching method.

Digital [[pedagogy]] is the study and use of contemporary [[digital technology|digital technologies]] in [[teaching]] and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.briancroxall.net/digitalpedagogy/what-is-digital-pedagogy/|title="Digital Pedagogy"?|date=2012-08-30|newspaper=A Digital Pedagogy Unconference|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital pedagogy may be applied to online, hybrid, and face-to-face learning environments.

== History ==
Digital pedagogy has its origins in [[distance learning]], which during the early twentieth century took the form of correspondence courses delivered by mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/ddeming/files/aer.p20151024.pdf|title=Can Online Learning Bend the Higher Education Cost Curve?|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of London offered the first distance learning degrees with its External Programme of 1858. Charles Dickens famously said of the External Programme that it was the "Peoples' University," as it allowed broader access to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://london.ac.uk/about-us|title=About us|work=University of London|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the improvement of communication technologies, it was assumed that the TV and radio would begin to change the course of education. In the United States, educational TV programs and radio broadcasts were created by institutions such as the University of Louisville with the cooperation of NBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Distance education|date=2018-10-15|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Distance_education&amp;oldid=864171895|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telecourses saw a resurgence in the early 1970s with the spread of community colleges. These distance courses paved the way for online education, which came to prevalence during the popularization of the Internet, beginning at the end of the twentieth century.

== Values and Methods ==
Digital pedagogy values [[open education]], including [[open educational resources]]; sharing syllabi; sharing teaching resources through tools such as [[GitHub]] and [[Creative Commons]]; self-directed interest based student project, and publishing using [[open access]] and [[open peer review]]. Digital Pedagogy is not only about using digital technologies for teaching and learning but rather approaching digital tools from a critical pedagogical perspective. So, it is as much about using digital tools thoughtfully as it is about deciding when not to use digital tools, and about paying attention to the impact of digital tools on learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/digitalpedagogy/|title=Primer: Digital Pedagogy|last=|first=|date=|website=Hybrid Pedagogy Lab|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immersive technology]] can be used in the classroom as a form of digital pedagogy. It provides students the ability to engage in 3D modeling and collaborative world building. Examples of 3D modeling includes Matthew Nicholls'  [https://www.reading.ac.uk/classics/Stories/class-matthew-nicholls-story.aspx Virtual Rome] and [https://www.sketchup.com/ SketchUp Pro] which allows users to create 3D models of historical structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://er.educause.edu/blogs/2018/6/putting-immersive-technology-to-work-examples-from-the-digital-humanities|title=Putting Immersive Technology to Work: Examples from the Digital Humanities|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical Application  ==
Digital pedagogy looks critically at digital tools as potential means for learning and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen|first=Brier,|date=2014|title=Review: Digital Humanities Pedagogy: Practices, Principles, and Politics|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_pubs/204/|journal=CUNY Academic Works|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers digital content and space as valuable sites for information and knowledge, in addition to traditional mediums such as books or the classroom. Digital pedagogy itself is also sensitive to the ongoing discussions and debates happening within the sphere of [[digital humanities]], namely to its practices, principles and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen|first=Brier,|date=2014|title=Review: Digital Humanities Pedagogy: Practices, Principles, and Politics|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_pubs/204/|journal=CUNY Academic Works|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tools have been widely utilized in elementary school and high school classrooms in successful examples of digital pedagogy:

* [http://chronozoom.com/#/t00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) Chronozoom]: Similar to [[Prezi]], Chronozoom is a digital timeline tool that lets its users create interactive timelines and interact with historical events on a larger and deeper scale than previously viewed in textbooks. Chronozoom allows for creators to insert images, videos and sound into their timelines.
* Group Text-Messaging Tools for Teachers: These tools allow for teachers and students to text without endangering privacy and keeping professional distance. They allow you to create class accounts, and conceal everyone’s phone numbers. They also keep records of text messaging conversations. Examples include [https://classparrot.com/ ClassParrot], [https://www.classpager.com/ ClassPager] and [https://www.remind.com/ Reminder101]. 

The experimental nature of digital pedagogy enables critical reflection on its successes and contradictions in its educative possibilities. As such, it becomes a key foray into the ongoing discussion of [[educational technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewin|first=David|last2=Lundie|first2=David|date=2016-02-22|title=Philosophies of Digital Pedagogy|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11217-016-9514-7|journal=Studies in Philosophy and Education|language=en|volume=35|issue=3|pages=235–240|doi=10.1007/s11217-016-9514-7|issn=0039-3746}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, engagement in the philosophies of digital pedagogy has renewed discussion on the politics and ethics of technology and its implication of learning as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewin|first=David|last2=Lundie|first2=David|date=2016-02-22|title=Philosophies of Digital Pedagogy|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11217-016-9514-7|journal=Studies in Philosophy and Education|language=en|volume=35|issue=3|pages=235–240|doi=10.1007/s11217-016-9514-7|issn=0039-3746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It takes texts and breaks them down into categories, or “facets.” Prism has been used in both the K-12 community, and in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prism.scholarslab.org/pages/about?locale=en|title=Prism  {{!}} About|website=prism.scholarslab.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging the changing nature of new media practices and interaction, digital pedagogy centers the student by designing various student-led, collaborative and project-based activities to allow students to control the pace and space of learning.&lt;ref name="sharples2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sharples|first=Mike|date=2016-12|title=Digital education: Pedagogy online|journal=Nature|volume=540|issue=7633|pages=340–340|doi=10.1038/540340a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is within the digital geography where new collaborative, interactive, and participatory possibilities are introduced. Platforms, such as [[Massive open online course|massive open online courses]] (MOOCs), now supplement the physically-located classrooms.&lt;ref name="sharples2016"/&gt;

The following tools have been utilized in higher education classrooms:

*[https://voyant-tools.org/ Voyant Tools]: [[Voyant Tools]] is an open-source, web-based reading and analysis and visualization tool for digital texts. Users can input text and see it analyzed via word frequency lists and other text analytics.
*[https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/projects/machine-aided-close-listening-and-performed-poem Machine-Aided Close Listening] (MACL): Machine-Aided Close Learning has been used to help students examine a text’s sonic materials like timing, volume, pitch, and tempo.Chris Mustazza used it to examine a Robert Creely poem for pitch and loudness, and his assistant, Zoe Stoller, used the MACL app to create a visualization of the tempo in a Robert Frost poem.
*[https://thedeletionist.com/about.html The Deletionist]: The Deletionist is a Javascript bookmarklet that creates erasure poems out of webpages. It can be used to uncover patterns in texts and to introduce students to the history of erasure poetry.

==Critical Digital Pedagogy==
Based on theories stemming from [[Critical Race Theory]], [[Feminist Theory]], [[Liberation-based theory]] and other philosophical approaches that address how understanding power structures is essential to the dismantling of oppression, Critical Digital Pedagogy follows the ethics of acknowledging no information, knowledge, learning or teaching is ever neutral of political meaning. Reflective dialogue is a key component of a critical consciousness-raising, a liberatory praxis attributed to [[Paulo Freire]], in learning so that the learning process itself is a praxis of liberation. Critical Digital Pedagogy integrates a second-order, metal-level analysis as part of teaching and learning about or through the use of web-based tools, digital platforms and other forms of technology. As a method or resistance against oppression, Critical Digital Pedagogy seeks to engage individuals in collaborative practices, is inclusive of voices across social-political identities, and situates itself outside boundaries of traditional education, which is considered to be based on a [[Banking model of education|banking model]] of teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hybridpedagogy.org/critical-digital-pedagogy-definition/|title=Critical Digital Pedagogy: a Definition {{!}} Hybrid Pedagogy|date=2014-11-18|work=Hybrid Pedagogy|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response/Criticism ==

=== Schools/programs that have incorporated digital pedagogy ===

==== K-12 Education ====
Digital pedagogy for K-12 education follows models such as hybrid or [[blended learning]] and online-only classes. The implementation of online-only courses in K-12 education has become more popular as budget cuts make offering higher level courses such as AP classes less feasible, or if there is not enough student interest to warrant offering the subject. Fully online courses involve a digital teacher who has many digital students with no in-class or face-to-face time. These courses can be facilitated either within a school or made accessible to home-school or abroad students. Many virtual school options receive at least partial funding from state education initiatives and are monitored by state educational committees. [[Florida Virtual School]], is funded through the Florida Education Finance Program (FEFP), and is free to Florida residents. FLVS is governed by a board of trustees appointed by the governor, and its performance is monitored by the Commissioner of Education and reported to the State Board of Education and Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/FileStores/Web/HouseContent/Approved/Web%20Site/education_fact_sheets/2011/documents/2010-11%20Florida%20Virtual%20School.3.pdf|title=Florida Virtual School|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is much debate over the efficacy of virtual school options. The consensus on blended education, where students receive face-to-face instruction from teachers and the online portions are only conducted in partial time, is largely positive. Blended learning is credited with allowing students to take some agency with the pace of learning, something that would not otherwise be available to them in a traditional classroom. It allows students to make meaningful decisions about their learning and sets a basis for lifelong self-motivation and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tech.ed.gov/netp/learning/|title=Learning - Office of Educational Technology|work=Office of Educational Technology|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of new technologies in classrooms also allows students to keep pace with innovations in learning technologies, to expand the pedagogical toolset available to them, such as message-boards and videos, and to have instantaneous feedback and evaluation.

However, in fully online courses, the benefits of online learning is less clear. While more advanced students may excel in online courses, reported in one study of online mathematics for grade 8 students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/northeast/pdf/REL_20124021.pdf|title=Access to Algebra I: The Effects of Online Mathematics for Grade 8 Students|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the students who need the most help may suffer disproportionately to their peers in traditional face-to-face courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/business/online-courses-are-harming-the-students-who-need-the-most-help.html|title=Online Courses Are Harming the Students Who Need the Most Help|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that online-only courses exacerbate difficulties for needy students as well as allow more advanced students the agency desired to excel in individual learning.

'''Dolphin Scholarship Foundation (DSF)''' was established in 1960 to assist children of the [[ComSubLant|U.S. Submarine Force]] with [[college scholarship]]s through private [[fundraising]] and [[donation]]s, as well as any dividends from its [[trust fund]]. 

The first scholarship of $350 was awarded to John L. Haines, Jr. in June 1961. Funds were raised primarily through the tireless efforts of submarine officers' wives' organizations throughout the [[United States]]. As the cost of [[college education]] continued to skyrocket, so did the need for the Foundation to assist children of Submariners. Today DSF receives individual, corporate, memorial and [[Combined Federal Campaign]] donations, as well as continued strong support from the submarine community and spouse organizations. Donations go directly to support scholarships; income from DSF investments supplement these contributions for scholarships and operating expenses. Dolphin Scholarship Foundation also conducts fundraisers such as the Annual Cartoon Calendar (since 1963), the Annual Golf Tournament in [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]] (since 2006) and virtual submarine races.  
 
Dolphin Scholarship Foundation currently awards 137 annual scholarships of $3,400 to each Dolphin Scholar. Each recipient may potentially receive a total of $13,600 for up to eight semesters of [[undergraduate]] study. The number of new awards granted each year is determined by graduation and attrition of current Dolphin Scholars. Dolphin Scholarship Foundation is proud to have awarded over eight million dollars to over 1000 students attending [[University|universities]] and [[college]]s through the [[United States]].

The '''[http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/home EU Open Data Portal]''' gives access to open data published by EU institutions, agencies and other bodies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/providers|title=About EUODP data providers|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The portal is a key element of EU open data strategy.

== Legal basis and launch date ==

Launched in December 2012 in beta mode, the portal was formally established by Commission Decision of 12 December 2011 (2011/833/EU) on the reuse of Commission documents to promote accessibility and reuse.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011D0833|title=Commission Decision of 12 December 2011 (2011/833/EU)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the operational management of the portal is the task of the [http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/about#searchHelp Publications Office of the European Union], implementation of EU open data policy is the responsibility of the [[Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology]] of the European Commission.

== Features ==

The portal allows anyone to easily search, explore, link, download and reuse the data for commercial or non-commercial purposes, through a catalogue of common [[metadata]]. Through this catalogue, users access data stored on the websites of the EU institutions, agencies and other bodies.

Semantic technologies offer new functionalities. The metadata catalogue can be searched via an interactive search engine ([http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data Data tab]) and through [[SPARQL]] queries ([http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/linked-data Linked data tab])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/search|title=How the search function works in the EU Open Data Portal|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There is also a showcase of [http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/apps visualisation applications] from various EU institutions, agencies and other bodies.

Users can suggest data they would like the portal to be linked to, give feedback on the quality of data obtainable and share information with other users about how they have used it.

The interface is in 24 EU official languages, while most metadata are currently available in a limited number of languages (English, French and German). Some of the metadata (e.g. names of the data providers, geographical coverage) are in 24 languages following the translation of [[controlled vocabulary]] lists that are used by the portal.&lt;ref name="r3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/authority/index.html|title=EU controlled vocabularies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terms of reuse ==

Most data accessible via the EU Open Data Portal are covered by the Europa Legal Notice &lt;ref name="r6"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ec.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm|title=Europa Legal Notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be reused free of charge, for commercial and non-commercial purposes, provided that the source is acknowledged. Specific conditions on reuse, related mostly to the protection of third-party intellectual property rights, apply for a very limited amount of data.

== Data available ==

The portal contains a very wide variety of high-value open data across EU policy domains, as also more recently identified by the G8 Open Data Charter. These include the economy, employment, science, environment and education. The number of data providers — which include [[Eurostat]], the [[European Environment Agency]] and the [[Joint Research Centre]] — continues to grow.

So far, around 70 EU institutions, bodies or departments (e.g. Eurostat, the European Environment Agency, the Joint Research Centre and other European Commission Directorates General and EU Agencies) have made datasets available, making a total of over 11,700.

In addition to giving access to datasets, the portal also is an easy entry point to a whole range of [http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/apps visualisation applications] using EU data. The applications are displayed as much for their information value as for giving examples of what applications can be made using the data.

== Architecture of the portal ==

The portal is built using open source solutions such as the [[Drupal]] content management system and [[CKAN]], the data catalogue software developed by the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]]. It uses Virtuoso as an [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] database and has a [[SPARQL]] endpoint.

Its metadata catalogue is built on the basis of international standards such as [[Dublin Core]], the data catalogue vocabulary DCAT and the asset description metadata schema [[ADMS]].&lt;ref name="r5"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/open-data-portals|title=Open Data Portals in Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper published in 2007 by Dr. [[Carlton R. Pennypacker|Carl Pennypacker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Pennypacker |first= Carlton R.  |authorlink= Carlton R.

Using the [[Internet]], G-HOU participants around the world request observations from an automated [[telescope]], download images from a large image [[archive]], and analyze them with the aid of user-friendly image processing software, as described by Dr. Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title = Image Processing for Educators in Global Hands-On Universe |last1 = Miller |first1 = J.

==About==
'''Global Hands-On Universe''' is a worldwide project, with extensions over all the continents, the root project being GHOU. The project is based on observations, possibly acquired by the pupils themselves in classrooms thanks to a worldwide network of automatic telescopes operated via Internet or didactic tools ([[webcam]] system, radio telescope) developed within this project. These observations can be manipulated in classrooms with a specific software designed to be pupil-friendly. They are integrated into pedagogical resources constructed in a close collaborative work between researchers and teachers. The resources developed in the course of this project are posted on the Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv |eprint=astro-ph/0109372 |title=Hands-On Universe: A Global Program for Education and Public Outreach in Astronomy |author1= Boer |author2= Pack |author3= Pennypacker |author4= Melchior |author5= Faye |author6= Ebisuzaki |date= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) launched in 2009 the Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP), a Cornerstone project of the [[International Year of Astronomy]] 2009. GHOU is a major component of GTTP.

GHOU, among which EU-HOU is the leading consortium, is now officially included in the Astronomy for the Developing World Strategic Plan 2010-20 of IAU, under Section 3.4.2 Astronomy for Children and Schools. During the next decade the IAU will concentrate more resources on education activities for children and schools designed to advance sustainable global development.

In [[Europe]], the EU-HOU project is led by Dr. Ferlet &amp; Dr A.-L. Melchior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode= 2006IAUSS...2E...3F |title=Hands-on Universe - Europe|journal=IAU Special Session|volume=2|pages=3|author1=Ferlet|first1=R.|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU-HOU has been funded through the [[European Community]] (EC) program MINERVA (SOCRATES) for a two-year period (2004–2006), and through  the European Community (EC) program COMENIUS (LifeLong Learning Program) for two two-year periods (2008–2010, 2010-2012). EU-HOU has extended up to 15 EC countries, with national websites. The [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]] in [[Paris]] is the educational centre for the EU-HOU project. The EU-HOU project has developed numerous  (free) pedagogical resources tested in classrooms and posted on the project's [http://www.euhou.net website]. The most ambitious ones are: (1) the multilingual [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/salsaj-software-mainmenu-9 SalsaJ] software: it enables secondary school pupils to handle astronomical data and analyse them. An exercise series based on this software has been developed. Associated data can be downloaded directly from the software. (2) The EUHOUMW Small Radiotelescope Network developed in the framework of the Comenius project "Connecting classrooms to the Milky Way" enables secondary school pupils to access the instruments installed in five different European countries (France, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain). Kids can observe the hydrogen from the Milky Way with these 3-metres radiotelescopes.

In the USA, HOU has developed and pilot tested an educational program that enables high school students to request their own observations from professional observatories. Students download telescope images to their classroom computers and use the powerful HOU image processing software to visualize and analyze their  data. [[High school]] [[curriculum]] developed by HOU integrates many of the science and math topics and skills outlined in national standards into open-ended astronomical investigations. HOU has also developed activities and tools for middle school students and products for informal science education centers. The Lawrence Hall of Science at [[University of California, Berkeley]], is the educational center for the HOU project.

In [[Asia]], the AS-HOU section have China and Japan strongly involved. They have their own web sites.

In Africa, AF-HOU is now extending to Kenya&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode= 2008cosp...37.2272O |title=Hands-on Universe |journal=37th COSPAR Scientific Assembly|volume=37 |page=E2|id=PE2-0011-08|author1=Oduori |first1=Susan |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a recently launched pilot, researchbased astronomy and astrophysics curriculum into Kenya High in Nairobi, Kenya as a vehicle to introducing the methodologies of scientific research into secondary education.

== Teacher training sessions ==

In the context of the European Commission [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]], EU-HOU proposes regular European training sessions in France, at [[Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University]] in Paris, since 2010. These sessions are published on the Comenius training database (reference numbers: FR-2010-314-003, FR-2011-359-006, [http://ec.europa.eu/education/trainingdatabase/index.cfm?fuseaction=DisplayCourse&amp;cid=34183 FR-2013-408-003]).

The main goal of these training sessions is to re-awake the interest for science in the young generation with inquiry-based methods. Active methods based e.g. on kinesthesia ([[Proprioception]]) have been recently introduced to introduce modelling concepts. Renewing of the teaching of science is fulfilled through astronomy as a well-established source of motivation, and through the use of new Information and Communication Technologies - ICT. Involving teachers in a variety of research-based astronomical projects, they will get excited, enthused and motivated to teach science/technology/maths. '''The training is intended to enhance basic competencies of teachers and develop higher level skills and expertise, primarily in [[Information and communication technologies in education]] (ICT), maths and physics area'''.

These sessions are financed through European Commission Comenius national Agencies ([[Comenius programme]]). Information related to scheduled training sessions are posted on the [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/training-sessions-mainmenu-184 EU-HOU] Website and its [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/news-mainmenu-49 news].

A dedicated [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/forum/index forum]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in English has been opened to favour feed-back from trained teachers and interaction with a wider educator and researcher community.

==Plot==
Set in the not so distant future, in the [[United States]], sixteen-year-old Herman Howards makes a fateful decision. He enters his suburban school and kills thirty nine students, two teachers, and a police officer. Just before his arrest he emails his idol, famous journalist Lax Morales, sending him clips of the shootings captured with Herman's own digital camera. In the clips Herman tells Lax, "I want to tell my story on your show". Lax, haunted by his own past, is now face to face with Herman. Herman is executed in the electric chair. The movie explores why and how a massacre like this can happen in our society, desensitizing in America, youth violence and bullying, the impact the media has on our individual quest for fame, and ultimately our need for connection.

==Reception==
''Hello Herman'' holds a 13% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 6 reviews, with a [[Weighted mean|rating average]] of 4/10.&lt;ref name="rotten Tomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hello_herman_2012/ |title=Hello Herman |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] has given the film a weighted average score of 27/100, based on 5 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hello Herman Reviews - Metacritic |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hello-herman |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam Adams of ''[[Time Out New York]]'' said that the most fitting punishment for ''Hello Herman'' was to simply ignore its existence: "it barely tries to offer insight into its much-debated subject, content to rip the scab off an ever-fresh wound for the sake of controversy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timeout.com/us/film/hello-herman-movie-review |title=Hello Herman movie review |first=Sam |last=Adams |authorlink= |newspaper=[[Time Out New York]] |date=June 3, 2013 |accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''{{-'}}s Amy Nicholson wrote about the incompetence of the director: "we're not sure what director Michelle Danner, who plays Herman's defensive mother in an uncredited role, wants us to get besides a reminder that angry boys act out for a host of half-defined reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-hello-herman-review-20130606,0,512587.story? |title='Hello Herman' misses target |first=Amy |last=Nicholson |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 6, 2013 |accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{-'}}s Rob Staeger stated that "the dialogue is all surface: emotions are laid out on the autopsy table for the audience to dissect and analyze, but rarely feel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-06-05/film/flat-hello-herman-is-a-satire-long-past-its-expiration-date/ |title=Flat Hello Herman is a satire long past its expiration date |first=Rob |last=Staeger |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |date=June 7, 2013 |accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]''{{-'}}s Jeannette Catsoulis finds that "pointing at everything and elucidating nothing, Hello Herman arrives freighted with the anti-bullying agenda of its director, Michelle Danner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeannette |last=Catsoulis |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/movies/hello-herman-directed-by-michelle-danner.html?_r=0 |title=So many culprits in a teenage rampage |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 6, 2013 |accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to other critics, Sam Kashner of Vanity Fair said that “''Hello Herman'' is a powerful and important work, a darkly brilliant tone poem about America’s tango with violence and fame. Herman will get under your skin. He may even follow you home. What is certain is you won’t soon forget him.”{{cn|date=October 2014}}

The Examiner's Courtney Hartmann hit says that “Michelle Danner’s ''Hello Herman'' takes a look at the troubled youth of America… the film will definitely spark up conversations that have never really died since Columbine. The issues of teens in America especially when it comes to bullying and retaliation are a problem that need to be addressed far beyond a film.” Danny Miller of MSN Movies called ''Hello Herman'' “A powerful film that should be required viewing for adolescents everywhere."

Director Michelle Danner issued a statement through the ''Hello Herman'' website addressing those that did not quite understand her intentions. "''Hello Herman'' is being released today and it is sparking a lot of controversy. Some would love for me to not have made this movie. They want you to ignore the problem of violence in America. Many understand why I made this movie. They called it 'Daring… Unnerving, thought provoking…The type of movie that Hollywood rarely makes but should make more often.' I am purposely making a point to touch on many issues. It’s about being very focused on the fact that there isn’t just one issue contributing to the escalating violence in teens, there are a multitude of them. Our world is not safe. I am a mother and feel a responsibility. This breakout violence is not going away. It’s spiraling out of control.  There are so many factors that come together for these events to occur. I wanted to start the conversation and not let it die. When a shooting happens the media pounds on us and then they’re on to the next thing. No one does anything and it happens again and again. That’s why I made the film. Nothing changes. We need to keep seeing movies that deal with these issues. No, it’s not a popcorn film. We can’t drop the ball on this one. This is the world we are leaving to our children and this world is getting more and more dangerous. We have to do something about it."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hellohermanthemovie.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6651">'''Joseph M. Williams''' (18 August 1933, [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] – 22 February 2008, [[South Haven, Michigan|South Haven]], [[Michigan]]) was a professor in the Department of English Language and Literature at the [[University of Chicago]] where he promoted clarity in writing for many years.  He authored several books on language and writing.

==Biography==

Williams began as a researcher of English language. In ''Origins of the English Language: A Social &amp; Linguistic History'' he traces the history of the English language from the evolution of man through to Modern English. His interest in studying close connection between grammar and rhetoric, reflected in another earlier book ''The New English: Structure, Form, Style'', culminated in [[Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace]], his noteworthy textbook on [[writing style]].

In ''Style'', based on "The Little Red Schoolhouse" course he taught at Chicago for many years,&lt;ref&gt;Now, also English 13000/33000 ([http://writing-program.uchicago.edu/ Academic and Professional Writing]).&lt;/ref&gt; Williams established and vehemently defended two basic principles that “it is good to write clearly, and anyone can.” (''Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace'' (9th Edition) 4). To meet these ends Williams laid out streamlined steps to help writers first make their sentences and paragraphs clear and then graceful. Writers can make sentences clearer by identifying an actor in the sentence subject and then expressing actions in specific verbs. Sentences are easier to understand when the beginning connects to prior sentences and the end presents new information. Graceful sentences and paragraphs are concise, shapely (uninterrupted and coordinated), and elegant (balanced in syntax, meaning, sound and rhythm). Paragraphs are cohesive when sentences have a sense of flow, and coherent when paragraphs are felt as the whole. In later editions, he discussed ethics of writing understood as a social act between writer and reader and offered steps to produce coherent documents.

Noting the kinship between ''Style'' and [[The Elements of Style]] by [[William Strunk]] and [[E.B. White]], Berkeley professor [[J. Bradford DeLong]] praised Williams for practicality of his advice.&lt;ref&gt;DeLong, J. Bradford.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20030117165037/http://www.econ161.berkeley.edu/econ_articles/reviews/williams.html "Review of Joseph Williams, Style: Toward Clarity and Grace"] (December 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Craft of Research]], a collaborative textbook written by Williams and his two long-term academic colleagues and friends – [[Wayne C. Booth]] and [[Gregory G. Colomb]], – was designed to help students plan, carry out and report on research in any field and at any level – from a term paper to a dissertation, an article, and a book. Authors understood writing a research report as “thinking in writing” and “thinking from the point of view of [the] readers” (''The Craft of Research'' 15). Their treatment of research arguments included a refinement of [[Stephen Toulmin]]’s formal layout of arguments. In another book, ''The Craft of Argument'', Williams and Colomb looked at written arguments in general. The authors claimed that in argument “questions and answers not only seek truth, but also generate the means of persuasion that rhetoric seeks” (''The Craft of Argument'' xix).
 
Together with Gregory G. Colomb, [[Francis X. Kinahan]], and [[Lawrence D. McEnerney]], Williams developed innovative instructional materials for advanced writers in the academy and the professions known as "The Little Red Schoolhouse".&lt;ref&gt;Donnell, Jeffrey.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20030424094319/http://www.me.gatech.edu/me/academics/little_red_schoolhouse/description.html "The Little Red Scoolhouse"], Georgia Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040215090006/http://writing-program.uchicago.edu/courses/grad.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1980, Williams (together with Colomb and others) ran Clearlines, a consulting firm helping writers in corporations, law firms, and consulting groups to write clearly and concisely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clearlinesconsulting.com/ Clearlines website]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Aku no Kyōten'''''|悪の教典||literally "Lesson of Evil"}}, known in English as '''''Lesson of the Evil''''', is a 2012 Japanese [[slasher film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] starring [[Hideaki Itō]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyograph.com/news/ito-hideaki-to-star-as-psychopathic-teacher-in-aku-no-kyoten-movie/|title=Ito Hideaki to star as psychopathic teacher in "Aku no Kyoten" movie|date=5 March 2012|accessdate=7 March 2012|work=Tokyograph}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an adaptation of [[Yusuke Kishi]]'s 2010 novel of the same name. The film contains many references to German culture, such as to [[Goethe]]'s [[The Sorrows of Young Werther]] and in the film a vinyl record with the German song about [[Mack the Knife]] written by [[Bertolt Brecht]] is played.

==Plot==
An English teacher named Seiji Hasumi ([[Hideaki Itō]]) is loved by his students and respected by his peers. He graduates from [[Harvard University]] with an MBA, and works at Morgenstern, a European investment bank, for two years. Hasumi returns to Japan to pursue high school teaching. However, his [[outward charm]] masks his true nature. In reality, Hasumi is a [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]] who is unable to feel [[empathy]] for other human beings. Specifically, he has a severe [[antisocial personality disorder]]. Having killed both of his parents and his former tutor at the age of fourteen, Hasumi turns into a fiendishly clever killer. During his time in the States, Hasumi meets a partner in crime, an American named Dave, who thinks he shares the same "hobby" as Hasumi – killing people for fun. The two can be seen carrying buckets full of human blood, bones, and organs somewhere, giving off the notion that they committed numerous murders while working together. Hasumi eventually kills his partner by knocking him out and burning him alive inside a barrel, stating that while Dave enjoys killing for fun, Hasumi does not.

Back in Japan, Hasumi chooses to deal with problems like bullying and student sexual harassment, starting by dealing with the school cheating issue. Upon collecting all of the students' cell phones prior to their exams, Hasumi secretly uses a [[cell phone jammer]] to completely prevent any cheating during the test. The group of students that had cheated on previous exams became suspicious after none of the group's cell phones have service during the test and immediately suspect the adviser of the Radio Club, Tsurii – a loner [[physics]] teacher. They are then confronted by Tsurii himself who clarifies that he was not responsible for the jamming. A man who regularly meets with the school to complain about students bullying his daughter, Rina, is murdered. Someone has replaced the bottles of water he kept around his house to scare off cats with kerosene, as the man is a [[chainsmoker]] the bottles soon catch fire and explode. Tsurii soon meets with the intelligent ringleader of the cheating group, Keisuke, revealing his suspicions of Hasumi. Tsurii explains he has dug into Hasumi's past and found strange details, such as at another school where Hasumi started his teaching career that later had four student suicides. During this time, however, Hasumi had bugged the room and learned of Tsurii's suspicion, and confronts him on a train, murdering him and making his death appear as a [[hanging suicide]]. Hasumi then confronts Keisuke after the announcement of Tsurii's suicide causes him to panic. Hasumi knocks Keisuke out and ties him up until the end of school, after which Hasumi tortures him into admitting that he and his friends were indeed cheating. Hasumi checks that Keisuke didn't tell others of Tsurii's suspicions, before killing him and hiding his body.

During the same time period, Hasumi is brought to the attention of a [[blackmail]] case from one of his students. A store owner, Meka, caught a female student, Miya, shoplifting but swears not to charge her for it. However, PE teacher Shibahara blackmails Miya, as he has recorded her admission of shoplifting, into giving him sexual favors or risk being charged. Hasumi, assures Miya that a blackmail and [[statutory rape]] case is more serious than shoplifting and affirms to her that she is safe from the law and no longer needs to succumb to the blackmail. Miya later meets Hasumi on the school roof, she thanks him with a hug that advances into a kiss and the two become lovers. In the meantime, Hasumi finds out about art teacher Kume's sexual relationship with a male student; he blackmails Kume into lending him his luxury apartment. Hasumi later takes Miya to the apartment and the two have sex. Hasumi presses Miya into giving him access to an online private discussion board that his students use, anonymously making claims about the murder of Rina's father, accusing delinquent student Tadenuma, who had targeted Rina online previously. After a fight breaks out at the school, Hasumi invites Tadenuma out for a drink and murders him; the students later assume that Tadenuma ran away from home.

Events have passed until Hasumi's homeroom students are staying overnight in the school, preparing an elaborate [[haunted house]] for the school cultural festival. Hasumi lures Miya to the rooftop, knocking her out and throwing her off the roof to fake her suicide; as she had grown suspicious of Tadenuma's disappearance. When another student comes to the roof looking for Miya, she finds the suicide note forged by Hasumi; he quickly kills her too. As Hasumi has no method of masking his murder of the second student, he quickly comes up with a plan. Hasumi decides to start a [[school massacre]] of his students for which he will frame Kume, who frequents a shooting range, by wearing his shoes throughout the killings. Throughout the massacre, Hasumi's shotgun can be seen possessed by ex-partner in crime Dave, talking to him. As the students hear the bangs of the shotgun, Hasumi tricks most of the students by using the intercom to warn them of "an intruder with a shotgun" and orders the students to proceed to the roof - which he had locked access to beforehand - and wait until help arrives. With some of the students proceeding to the stairs to the roof, another group hide inside the art room, closing it off with fire shutters and barricading the entry points. One of the students, skilled [[Archery|archer]] Kakeru, manages to escape the school far enough with his archery gear to find a man who is able to call the police. He later runs back to the school to rescue his crush Satomi, who is found trying to escape by roping out of a window of the art room and slips, breaking her ankles. Kakeru screams out her name, alerting Hasumi to their presence, who then proceeds to aim out of a window at the two students. The Kakeru readies an arrow and fires at Hasumi, but Hasumi fires as well, deflecting the arrow off-course, slaying Kakeru, and then Satomi. With the group of students still in the art room thinking they are safe, they are unaware that they did not untie the rope that Satomi had used to rappel down out of. Hasumi climbs the rope and proceeds to slay the group.

The massacre nears its end with two students who survive by dressing up two of their dead peers in their clothing and hiding inside the school as they toss the corpses down an emergency escape chute, tricking Hasumi into thinking the bodies are the last two students on his checklist attempting to escape. After the massacre at the school, Hasumi attempts to cover up his actions by making it seem like he had been handcuffed and knocked out by Kume and making it look like he committed suicide afterwards with Hasumi's shotgun, but his plans are foiled due to one of the two surviving students pointing out to the police that the school's training [[defibrillator]] records audio and contains evidence of one of the murdered students speaking his murderer's name prior to being slain by Hasumi. However, Hasumi plans to use his recently learned knowledge of [[Norse mythology]] as his legal defence by suggesting his acts to be "the will of God." The surviving student who pointed out the defibrillator exclaims that Hasumi is crazy, but the other surviving student says Hasumi is "starting the next game." It is then revealed that Miya survived after Hasumi tossed her off the school's roof and calls out Hasumi's name, ending the movie with "[[to be continued]]."

The film premiered at the [[Rome Film Festival]] on November 9, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/lesson-of-the-evil/5048849.article|title=Lesson Of The Evil – Review – Screen|work=[[Screen International|Screen]]|author=Lee Marshall|date=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was selected to screen at the [[Stanley Film Festival]] in April 2014.

==Reception==
Jay Weissberg of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the movie a negative review, calling it "nothing more than a slick slasher pic" and pointing out its debatable taste: "Even were the memory of the [[Anders Behring Breivik|Breivik]] massacre, among others, not so fresh, there's something deeply unseemly about turning a high-school bloodbath into an adrenaline-pumping pleasure ride."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117948720/|title=Variety Reviews – Lesson of the Evil – Film Reviews|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|author=Jay Weissberg|date=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jessica Kiang pans the movie, calling it "overlong and incoherent" and "sadly more bore than gore". She doesn't see any deeper meaning in this either: "It's just too silly to lay a claim to any philosophy, even nihilism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/rome-12-review-overlong-and-incoherent-takashi-miikes-lesson-of-the-evil-is-sadly-more-bore-than-gore-20121109|title=Rome Review: Overlong &amp; Incoherent|work=[[The Playlist]]|author=Jessica Kiang|date=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Barkan of the horror website [[Bloody Disgusting]] calls the movie "thoroughly entertaining and exciting", but criticizes that it overstays its welcome and would "benefit from a slightly tighter final cut."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3245545/fantasia-13-review-takashi-miikes-lesson-of-the-evil/|title=Lesson of the Evil – Review|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|author=Jonathan Barkan|date=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3501">The '''Lifetime Learning Credit''', provided by {{UnitedStatesCode|26|25A(b)}}, is available to [[taxpayer]]s in the United States who have incurred education expenses. For this credit to be claimed by a taxpayer, the student must attend school on at least a part-time basis. The credit can be claimed for education expenses incurred by the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or the taxpayer's dependent.

This credit allows for a 20% non-refundable tax credit for first $10,000 of qualified tuition and expenses to be fully creditable against the taxpayer's total tax liability. The maximum amount of the credit is $2000 per household.&lt;ref name="Publication 970 (2011), Tax Benefits for Education"&gt;https://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ar02.html#en_US_2011_publink1000255787&lt;/ref&gt; The credit is available for net tuition and fees (less grant aid) paid for post-secondary enrollment. The credit is available on a per-taxpayer (family) basis, and is phased out at the same income levels as the [[Hope Scholarship Credit]].

Critics have complained that complexity and restrictions on eligibility make the actual benefits per post-secondary student much lower than the theoretical maximum, and that even with tax credits, higher education remains tax-disadvantaged compared to other investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn = 2551567|title = The Knowledge Tax|last = Simkovic|first = Michael|date = 2015|journal = University of Chicago Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifying expenses==
"Qualified tuition and related expenses" is defined as "the tuition and fees paid at most colleges and universities for the enrollment or attendance of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or any dependent of the taxpayer.&lt;ref name=Donaldson&gt;Samuel A. Donaldson, ''Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials'', 2nd Edition (St. Paul: Thomson/West, 2007), 37-8.&lt;/ref&gt; These qualifying expenses do not include student activity fees, athletic fees, insurance costs, or room and board expenses.&lt;ref name=Donaldson/&gt;

==Limitations==
The Lifetime Learning Credit is subject to some limitations.&lt;!-- The credit will NOT be lost if the student is convicted of a [[felony]] drug offense. see [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch03.html#f25221v0301] --&gt; A taxpayer may not take both a [[Hope credit]] and a Lifetime Learning Credit for the same student in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Form 8863: Education Credits. https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8863.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The credit is subject to a limitation designed to reserve the benefit to low to moderate income taxpayers. The credit amount for 2015 is phased out gradually once a taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $55,000, and the credit is phased out entirely once a taxpayer's MAGI exceeds $65,000. These numbers are increased for taxpayers who file jointly to $110,000 and $130,000 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;IRS.gov "Lifetime Learning Credit" https://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch03.html#en_US_2014_publink1000178212&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18747">This is a list of '''scholarly publishing "[[sting operation]]s"''' such as the [[Sokal affair]]. These are nonsense papers that were accepted by an [[academic journal]] or [[academic conference]]; the list does not include cases of [[scientific misconduct]]. The intent of such publications is typically to expose shortcomings in a journal's [[Academic peer review|peer review]] process or to criticize the standards of [[Predatory open access publishing|pay-to-publish]] journals.

==Mathematics==
* In 2012, the [[open-access journal]] ''Advances in Pure Mathematics'' accepted a nonsense paper produced by the computer program Mathgen. Although the paper was accepted, the "author" declined to pay the journal's $500 publishing fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eldredge|first1=Nate|title=Mathgen paper accepted!|url=http://thatsmathematics.com/blog/archives/102|website=That's Mathematics!|accessdate=21 May 2017|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science==
* A paper randomly generated by the [[SCIgen]] program was accepted without peer-review for presentation at the 2005 [[World Multiconference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics]] (WMSCI). The conference announced the prank of having accepted the article as not [[peer review]]ed, despite none of the three assigned peer-reviewers having submitted an opinion about its fidelity, veracity, or accuracy to its subject. The three [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] graduate students who wrote the hoax article said they were unaware of the [[Sokal Affair]] until after submitting their article. Subsequently, numerous other papers generated by SCIgen have been published in scientific journals or accepted for presentation at scientific conferences.
* In December 2013, a [[Pune]]-based software professional submitted a bogus paper titled "use of cloud-computing and social media to determine box office performance", which was accepted by the [[Bhubaneswar]]-based Research Forum for their ICRIEST-AICEEMCS International Conference. The paper's introductory section itself cautioned that it contained some "gibberish" that was auto-generated by software. One section of the paper also includes 19 lines about the 1970s Bollywood film ''[[Sholay]]'', and 19 lines from ''[[My Cousin Vinny]]'', a 1992 Hollywood film. The incident highlighted a practice where "poor quality papers are accepted from students who are then asked to pay a few thousand rupees to participate in the conferences". After that the management of the event retracted the paper and apologized publicly. The Secretary in an interview described the acceptance as a human error of the coordinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140103/jsp/frontpage/story_17747127.jsp|title=Throw in F-word and become paper tiger|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014 an Australian computer scientist Dr Peter Vamplew submitted a paper to the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology (IJACT) after being angered that the journal would not take his email off its mailing list. The article, titled "[[Get me off your fucking mailing list|Get me off your fucking mailing list]]", consisted of the phrase "Get me off your fucking mailing list" being repeated for the entirety of the article body. The journal requested the researcher to "add some more recent references and do a bit of reformatting" saying that the article's "suitability for the journal was excellent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/25/journal-accepts-paper-requesting-removal-from-mailing-list|title=Journal accepts bogus paper requesting removal from mailing list|last=Safi|first=Michael|date=2014-11-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==
* Christoph Bartneck, an [[Associate Professor]] in [[Information Technology]] at New Zealand's [[University of Canterbury]], was invited to submit a paper to the 2016 International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear Physics organised by [[ConferenceSeries]]. With little knowledge of nuclear physics, he used [[iOS]]'s auto-complete function to write the paper, choosing randomly from its suggestions after starting each sentence,&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt; and submitted it under the name Iris Pear (a reference to [[Siri]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]).&lt;ref name="HIT"&gt;{{cite web|title=iOS Just Got A Paper On Nuclear Physics Accepted At A Scientific Conference|first=Christoph|last=Bartneck|date=20 October 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016|publisher=[[University of Canterbury]] Human Interface Technology (HIT) Lab, New Zealand|url=http://www.bartneck.de/2016/10/20/ios-just-got-a-paper-on-nuclear-physics-accepted-at-a-scientific-conference/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sample sentence from the abstract for the resulting manuscript was: "The atoms of a better universe will have the right for the same as you are the way we shall have to be a great place for a great time to enjoy the day you are a wonderful person to your great time to take the fun and take a great time and enjoy the great day you will be a wonderful time for your parents and kids"&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt; and the 516-word abstract contained the words "good" and "great" a combined total of 28 times (and is available online).&lt;ref name="HIT"/&gt; Despite making no sense, the work was accepted within three hours of submission and a conference registration fee of US$1099 requested.&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HIT"/&gt; The incident was compared to an earlier case where Peter Vamplew, from [[Federation University Australia|Federation University]] in Victoria, had a manuscript containing only the phrase "[[Get me off your fucking mailing list]]" accepted by the [[International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology]].&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nonsense paper written by iOS autocomplete accepted for conference|first=Elle|last=Hunt|date=22 October 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/22/nonsense-paper-written-by-ios-autocomplete-accepted-for-conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Journal accepts bogus paper requesting removal from mailing list|first=Michael|last=Safi|date=25 November 2014|accessdate=22 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/25/journal-accepts-paper-requesting-removal-from-mailing-list}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ConferenceSeries is associated with the [[OMICS Publishing Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bogus British Company "Accredits" OMICS Conferences|first=Jeffrey|last=Beall|authorlink=Jeffrey Beall|url=https://scholarlyoa.com/2016/10/13/bogus-british-company-accredits-omics-conferences/#comment-425306|date=13 October 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016|publisher=[[Scholarly Open Access]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106003123/https://scholarlyoa.com/2016/10/13/bogus-british-company-accredits-omics-conferences/#comment-425306|archivedate=6 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produces [[open access journals]] widely regarded as [[predatory open access publishing|predatory]], and has been accused of moving into "predatory meetings".&lt;ref name="Beall"&gt;{{cite web|title=OMICS Goes from "Predatory Publishing" to "Predatory Meetings" |first1=Jeffrey |last1=Beall |first2=Richard |last2=Levine |authorlink1=Jeffrey Beall |authorlink2=Richard Levine |url=https://scholarlyoa.com/2013/01/25/omics-predatory-meetings/ |date=25 January 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2016 |publisher=[[Scholarly Open Access]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605042104/https://scholarlyoa.com/2013/01/25/omics-predatory-meetings/ |archivedate=5 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartneck said he was "reasonably certain that this is a money-making conference with little to no commitment to science," given the poor quality of the review process and the high cost of attendance.&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt;

==Chemistry==
* "[[Who's Afraid of Peer Review?]]": In 2013 [[John Bohannon]] wrote in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' about a "[[sting operation]]" he conducted in which he submitted "a credible but mundane scientific paper, one with such grave errors that a competent peer reviewer should easily identify it as flawed and unpublishable", to 304 open-access publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohannon|first=John|title=Who's Afraid of Peer Review?|journal=Science|date=4 October 2013|volume=342|issue=6154|pages=60–65|doi=10.1126/science.342.6154.60|pmid=24092725|bibcode=2013Sci...342...60B}}&lt;/ref&gt; 157 journals accepted the paper. There have been some objections to the sting's methodology and about what conclusions can be drawn from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Mike|title=Anti-tutorial: how to design and execute a really bad study|url=http://svpow.com/2013/10/07/anti-tutorial-how-to-design-and-execute-a-really-bad-study/|work=Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week|accessdate=14 October 2013|author2=Matt Wedell|author3=Darren Naish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Kevin|title=The big picture about peer-review|url=http://blogs.library.duke.edu/scholcomm/2013/10/10/the-big-picture-about-peer-review/|work=Scholarly Communications @ Duke|publisher=Duke University Libraries|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
* John McLachlan, a professor of medical education, hoaxed the Jerusalem Conference on Integrative Medicine in 2010 with invented nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6979|title=Integrative medicine and the point of credulity|date=8 December 2010|publisher=The BMJ|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
* In 2007 [[Tomasz Witkowski]] published a fake article in the psychology journal ''[[Charaktery]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witkowski|first1=Tomasz|title=Psychological Sokal's Style Hoax|journal=The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practices|date=2011|volume=8|issue=1|pages=50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witkowski|first1=Tomasz|last2=Zatonski|first2=Maciej|title=Psychology Gone Wrong: The Dark Sides of Science and Therapy|date=2015|publisher=BrownWalker Press|isbn=1-62734-528-0|pages=259–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Randi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Randi|first1=James|title=Sokal Re-created|url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/142-swift-december-21-2007.html#i3|publisher=JREF|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other science bloggers covered the hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grivan|first1=Ray|title=Polish Sokal-style hoax|url=http://poorpothecary.blogspot.com/2007/11/polish-sokal-style-hoax.html|website=Poor Pothecary|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wanderer in the country of blindfolded|title=Polish 'Sokal hoax'|url=http://countryofblindfolded.blogspot.com/2007/11/polish-sokal-hoax.html|website=Random journeys through Science|date=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary and cultural studies==
* The [[Sokal affair]]: [[Alan Sokal]], a [[physics]] professor at [[New York University]] and [[University College London]], wrote a paper titled "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity]&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed that [[quantum gravity]] is a social and linguistic construct. The paper was published in the ''Social Text'' spring/summer 1996 "[[Science Wars]]" issue. At that time, the journal did not practice [[academic peer review]] and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html|title=Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity|accessdate=3 April 2007|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|date=28 November 1994|work=[[Social Text]] #46/47 (spring/summer 1996)|publisher=[[Duke University]] Press|pages=217–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9607/mst.html|title=Mystery science theater|author1=Bruce Robbins|author2=Andrew Ross|date=July 1996}}. Reply by Alan Sokal.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' that the article was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|work=''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]''|date=5 June 1996|accessdate= 2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Michel Maffesoli#Sociétés hoax|Sociétés hoax]]: Using a false identity, Manuel Quinon and Arnaud Saint-Martin submitted an intentionally inept and absurd article on the "[[Autolib']]", a small rentable car in [[Paris]], to [[Michel Maffesoli]]'s ''Sociétés'' journal. The article was deliberately incoherent and plastered with liberal quotes and references to Maffesoli and other postmodern thinkers. The article was duly "reviewed" by two people, before being accepted and published in ''Sociétés'' without any substantial editing.
* In May 2017, [[Peter Boghossian]] and James Lindsay published an absurd paper in the [[open access journal]] ''Cogent Social Sciences'' which argued that the penis is best understood not as a biological organ but rather as a social construct. The paper came to an absurd conclusion that the conceptual penis is a "driver behind much of climate change" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindsay|first=Jamie|last2=Boyle|first2=Peter|date=|title=The conceptual penis as a social construct|url=http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/conceptual-penis/23311886.2017.1330439.pdf|journal=Open Access Journal|volume=|page=6|pages=|via=Skeptic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The authors' goal was to expose bias towards extreme ideologies in social science and gender studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boghossian|first1=Peter|last2=Lindsay|first2=James|title=The conceptual penis as a social construct: a Sokal-style hoax on gender studies|url=http://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/conceptual-penis-social-contruct-sokal-style-hoax-on-gender-studies/|website=Skeptic|accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the sting operation argue that it did not demonstrate the existence of such biases, despite the authors' goals of doing so. Phil Torres of ''Salon'', for example, argued that the sting shows only that academic journals that require authors to pay for papers to be published have a financial inclination "to accept papers regardless of quality." He also noted that none of the editorial board members of ''Cogent Social Sciences'' have expertise in gender studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.salon.com/2017/05/22/why-the-conceptual-penis-hoax-was-a-bust-it-only-reveals-the-lack-of-skepticism-among-skeptics/ |title=Why the “Conceptual Penis” hoax was a bust: It only reveals the lack of skepticism among skep... |last=Torres |first=Phil |date=2017-05-22 |work=Salon |access-date=2018-01-23 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James E. McWilliams]] criticized the authors' motives, writing that "Boghossian and Lindsay are white men working in the most male-dominated academic fields (philosophy and math) attempting to humiliate through bullying one of the few academic fields dominated by women. In our current political climate—thriving as it does on shamelessness and humiliation—this scenario, as the motives become increasingly transparent, only calls for kind of scrutiny and understanding that gender studies can provide."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://psmag.com/education/the-hoax-that-backfired-how-an-attempt-to-discredit-gender-studies-will-only-strengthen-it |title=The Hoax That Backfired: How an Attempt to Discredit Gender Studies Will Only Strengthen It |last=McWilliams |first=James |date=2017-05-31 |work=Pacific Standard |access-date=2018-01-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [["Grievance Studies" affair]] (also referred to as the ""Sokal Squared" Scandal (or Hoax)" by the news media): Over 2017-2018 Helen Pluckrose, James A. Lindsay and [[Peter Boghossian]] wrote 20 hoax articles; at the time the hoax stopped, four papers had been published, three had been accepted but not yet published, seven were under review, and six had been rejected. The papers all focused on what the authors called “grievance studies" related to race, gender, sexuality and other forms of identity. The hoax was revealed and halted after one of the papers in the [[feminist geography]] journal ''[[Gender, Place and Culture]]'' was criticized on social media, and then on ''[[Campus Reform]]'', which led a ''Wall Street Journal'' editorial writer to investigate and report on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schuessler |first1=Jennifer |title=Hoaxers Slip Breastaurants and Dog-Park Sex Into Journals |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/arts/academic-journals-hoax.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 4, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper, which was in the process of being retracted when the ''Wall Street Journal'' story broke, referred to dog parks as "petri dishes for canine [[rape culture]]". The report also described a paper published in ''[[Affilia]]'' which contained a reworded excerpt from ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-news-comes-to-academia-1538520950|title=Fake news comes to academia|author=Jillian Kay Melchior|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=2018-10-02|accessdate=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
* Dr. [[Maarten Boudry]], a [[Philosophy|philosopher]], in 2012 persuaded two [[theology]] conferences to accept abstracts composed of meaningless [[word salad]] as a paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2012/09/28/philosopher-pulls-a-sokal-on-theology-conferences/|title=Philosopher Pulls a Sokal on Theology Conferences|author=Ed Brayton|work=Dispatches from the Culture Wars|accessdate=3 October 2014|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/2012/09/atheist-philospher-pulls-soakl-style.html|title=Atheist philosopher pulls Sokal-style hoax on theology conference|work=New Humanist Blog|publisher=Rationalist Association|accessdate=15 September 2014|date=25 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928014134/http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/2012/09/atheist-philospher-pulls-soakl-style.html#|archive-date=2012-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Logic games''', abbreviated '''LG''', and officially referred to as '''analytical reasoning''', is one of the sections which appear on the [[Law School Admission Test|Law School Admission Test (LSAT)]]. A logic games section contains four 5-8 question "games," totaling 22-25 questions. Each game begins by setting a scenario and providing a set of rules, followed by questions that test the test-taker's ability to understand and apply the rules, as well as make inferences based on them. In the words of the [[Law School Admission Council | Law School Admission Council (LSAC)]], which administer the test, it "measure[s] the ability to understand a structure of relationships and to draw logical conclusions about that structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

While most students find this section to be the most difficult section on the LSAT, it is widely considered the easiest and the fastest to improve at once the right strategies are learned and implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Common game types ==
=== Basic linear ===
In a basic linear game, two sets of variables are provided. The first set of variables, sometimes referred to as the 'base variables,' is usually days of the week, an order of arrival, or some other order. The second variable set is then matched to the first set according to a set of rule. For example:

{{Quote box
| quote = Eight runners, F, G, H, I, J, K, L and M, are running a marathon. The runners arrive at the finish line one at a time. The following facts are known about the runners' order of arrival. 

F does not arrive first or last. 

H arrives either immediately before or immediately after K.

If G arrives before H, G also arrives before I.

M arrives fifth.
| width = 50%
| align = center
}}

After setting the scenario, the game challenges the test-taker with questions such as:

{{quote box
 | quote=If F arrives at the finish line second, and H third, which one of the following runners cannot arrive at the finish line first:

a.	J

b.	K

c.	L

d.	G

e.	I
|width  = 50%
 |align  = center
}}

=== Advanced linear ===
Advanced linear games are similar to basic linear games, but three or more sets of variables are presented. For example: 

{{quote box|Seven runners, F, G, H, I, J, K and L, are running a marathon. Each runner wears a shirt that is blue, red, yellow or purple. No runner's shirt has more than one color. The runners arrive at the finish line one at a time.
|width  = 50%
 |align  = center
}}

The game can then provide rules and pose questions relating to the order of arrival of a runner, the color of a specific runner's shirt, sequences of color that must or must not be present, the shirt color of the runner that comes first etc.

=== Grouping ===
Grouping games provide variables that must be assigned to groups, but not in a specific order or sequence. For example: 

{{quote box|Eight soccer players, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W and X, must each be assigned to one of two groups, group 1 and group 2. No more than five players are assigned to one group.

T and U may not be in the same group.

If S and V are assigned to the same group, X is also assigned to that group.|width = 50% |align = center}}

=== Grouping linear combinations ===
Combination games follow a similar structure but include both linear and grouping elements.

== Less common game types ==
In addition to the common games, the LSAT sometimes includes other types of games that appear less frequently. Examples of less common games are:
* '''Mapping''' – Distribution of marks or [[landmark]]s on a map.   
* '''Pure sequencing''' – A variation on the basic linear games, but no placement rules are given, only sequencing rules.
* '''Circular linearity''' – Similar to linear games, but the variables are placed in a [[circle]] rather than a straight line, thus allowing spatial relationships in addition to the neighboring relationships.
* '''Pattern''' – A variation on the advanced linear games, but no placement rules are given, only pattern rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kiloram |first=David M.|date=1974 |title= LSAT Logic Games Bible |publisher=Webcom – Toronto Ontario |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
To solve the game quickly and efficiently, test-takers usually draw a master diagram at the bottom of the page. The rules and key inferences are written down in short symbols next to the diagram, and, where possible, marked on the diagram itself. A smaller diagram can also be drawn next to a specific question if that question poses any additional rules. On some games, it is helpful to create separate diagrams of all the possibilities and then use that to tackle the questions.

The study of minibeasts is common as part of the primary school curriculum. Studying minibeasts is a very effective way to observe many biological concepts first hand, which is not possible with many larger animals. Life cycles, food chains, and bodily structure and function are just some of the basic elements of biological science which can be easily explained using minibeasts. "Bugs Alive!" at Melbourne Museum features a huge number of live minibeasts with detailed information about them, while services such as "Minibeast Wildlife"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minibeastwildlife.com.au|title=Minibeast Wildlife - The Minibeast Experts|website=Minibeast Wildlife|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Travelbugs" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mini-beasts.com|title=Minibeasts : Travelbugs Mobile Mini-beasts|website=www.mini-beasts.com|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; take live minibeast to school and provide educational resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11353">'''Mobile-assisted language learning''' ('''MALL''') is language learning that is assisted or enhanced through the use of a handheld mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;Chinnery G. (2006) "Going to the MALL: Mobile Assisted Language Learning", Language Learning &amp; Technology 10, 1: 9-16, [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol10num1/emerging/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shield L. &amp; Kukulska-Hulme A. (eds.) (2008) Special edition of ''ReCALL'' (20, 3: 2008) on ''Mobile Assisted Language Learning'': http://www.eurocall-languages.org/recall/r_contents.html#sep08&lt;/ref&gt;

MALL is a subset of both Mobile Learning ([[m-learning]]) and [[computer-assisted language learning]] (CALL). MALL has evolved to support students’ language learning with the increased use of mobile technologies such as mobile phones (cellphones), [[MP3]] and [[MP4]] players, [[PDA]]s and devices such as the [[iPhone]] or [[iPad]]. With MALL, students are able to access language learning materials and to communicate with their teachers and peers at any time, anywhere.

==History==

'''1980s'''

*Twarog and Pereszlenyi Pinter used telephones to provide distant language learners with feedback and assistance.

'''1990s'''

*Instructors at [[Brigham Young University]]-Hawaii taught a [[distance education]] English course from Hawaii to Tonga via telephone and computer (Green, Collier, &amp; Evans, 2001)

'''2000s'''

*Dickey (2001) utilized teleconferencing to teach an English conversation course to students in [[South Korea]].
*[[Stanford University]] learning lab used integrated mobile phones in a Spanish learning program in 2001 (Brown, 2001).
*Thornton and Houser (2002; 2003; 2005) developed several innovative projects using mobile phones to teach English at a Japanese university. They also developed a course management system, Poodle, to facilitate deploying language learning material to mobile phones.
*[http://www.elearning.ac.uk/innoprac/learner/southampton.html City College Southampton] developed a web based "media board" (similar to a web-board but supporting [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] (MMS) as well as [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) and supplied learners of [[English as a Second Language]] (ESL) with mobile phones with inbuilt cameras and voice recording facilities (JISC, 2005).
*[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], developed several foreign language courses which have used wireless handheld computers for various classroom activities (Samuels, 2003).
*[[Duke University]] provided all incoming freshmen with free iPods equipped with voice recorders. Amongst the pilot courses utilizing the players were several language courses, which utilized both their listening and recording capabilities (Belanger, 2005).
*United Kingdom’s [[Open University]] used voice recorders and mini-camcorders to record interviews with other students and locals and to create audiovisual tours in distance-learning German and Spanish course (Kukulska-Hulme, 2005). The Open University used mobile phones for language learning&lt;ref&gt;http://openuniuk.learnosity.com/ Open University Mobile Phone based language learning&lt;/ref&gt;
*A project in Ireland used MALL for [[Irish Language]] learning and assessment &lt;ref&gt;http://foghlaim.edublogs.org/ NCCA MALL/ FÓN Project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.learnosity.com/go/client-ncca-ireland/ Learnosity Voice with Irish language learners&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Le@rning Federation (TLF) used MALL for [[Indonesian Language]] learning across three states&lt;ref&gt;http://thelearningfederation.edu.au/for_jurisdictions/research_and_trials/research2009.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.learnosity.com/blog/index.cfm/tlf The Le@rning Federation (TLF) MALL Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affordances and constraints==

Enhancing language learning through MALL provides dynamics which are not available through the traditional classroom. MALL offers ubiquitous access to learning anytime, anywhere the user has reception. This enables users to brush up on language skills just before or just after a conversation in the language they are learning. Handheld delivery also affords new dynamics for collaborative learning as users can share the language learning process in small synchronous groups.&lt;ref&gt;Nah, et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Kloper et al. (2002) claimed 5 properties of mobile devices which can produce unique educational affordances:
*Portability-the small size and weight of mobile devices means they can be taken to different sites or moved around within a site.
*Social interactivity-data exchange and collaboration with other learners can happen face-to-face.
*Context sensitivity-mobile devices can both gather and respond to real or simulated data unique to the current location, environment and time.
*Connectivity-a shared network can be created by connecting mobile devices to data collection devices, other devices or to a common network.
*Individuality- scaffolding for difficult activities can be customized for individual learners.

The most notable constraints for earlier MALL include poor sound and display quality coupled with very limited devices and download speeds. Newer integrated PDA devices have narrowed the gap with higher access speeds, larger screens, having functions and capacities similar to laptop computers (Nah, et al. 2008).

'''Njala University''' (NU) is a [[public university]] located   in [[Njala, Sierra Leone|Njala]], [[Moyamba District]], [[Sierra Leone]]. It is the second largest university in Sierra Leone (after the [[Fourah Bay College]]) and is also part of the [[University of Sierra Leone]]. The largest and main [[campus]] of Njala University is in Njala, Moyamba District; the other campus is Bo, the second largest city in sierra leone.

==History==
NU was originally created as part of the [[University of Sierra Leone]] (USL) in 1964 with the help of [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] and offered degrees in conjunction with the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]]. Subsequent legislation in 1972 paired Fourah Bay and Njala under the University of Sierra Leone act, where the presidents of each institution switched the presidency of the USL on a biennial basis. This continued until 2005, when the University act separated Fourah Bay and NU into distinct institutions independently run.

==Statistics==
In the 1999-2000 academic year, NU had 722 male students and 98 female, which equated to approximately 27% of Sierra Leonean college students. It had 436 male staff and 98 females.

==Current schools==
The university commenced in August 2005 with the founding of 6 schools:
* School of Education
* School of Community Health Services
* School of Social Sciences
* School of Agriculture
* School of Environmental Sciences
* School of Technology

==Bo campus==
Bo campus has 3 schools, Education, Community Health Services and Social Sciences.

==Njala campus==
Njala campus has the other 3 schools, including Agriculture, Environmental Sciences and Technology as well as the University secretariat. However, as of the 2005-2006 year, New England Ville in Freetown was temporarily home to all of Njala's facilities, pending the rebuilding of Njala's campus.

'''''OpenCity''''' is a [[free and open-source software]] 3D [[city-building game]] started in 2003 by France-based Vietnamese programmer Duong-Khang Nguyen. The game mechanics are similar to [[Simcity]],&lt;ref name="chip"/&gt; while the game developers don't strive to make it a direct Simcity [[Video game clone|clone]].

== Gameplay ==
In the game, the player builds a city by marking land as commercial, industrial or residential zones. Those zones depend on each other to grow. The player is also required to supply the city with power and connect the different zones by building roads.

==Origins and development==
'''''OpenCity''''' is the product of programmer Duong-Khang Nguyen and 3D artist Frédéric Rodrigo. Nguyen was inspired by the open source game ''FreeReign''; when he realized that the ''FreeReign'' project was [[Abandonware|abandoned]] and the [[source code]] was not in the condition to be improved, he began development on his own city-building simulator.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100625040648/http://linux.softpedia.com/get/GAMES-ENTERTAINMENT/Simulation/Open-City-10890.shtml Open City 0.0.6.1] on [[Softpedia]] (archived, June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The work in project started in 2003 with the registration on [[Sourceforge]].&lt;ref name="sourceforge"&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencity/ opencity] on sourceforge.net&lt;/ref&gt; OpenCity is [[Free and open-source software]] due to the [[Software license|licensing]] as [[GPLv2]].&lt;ref name="sourceforge"/&gt; Contributions to the game came from the game's community in form of translation and quality testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencity.info/en/Credits.html Credits] on the OpenCity website&lt;/ref&gt; OpenCity is built on cross platform libraries and APIs like [[Simple DirectMedia Library]] and [[OpenGL]], which allows [[Source port|porting]] to various OSes and platforms, like [[Windows]], [[OS X]]&lt;ref name=macobserver&gt;[http://www.macshareware.com/review/opencity OpenCity 0.0.6] on Macshareware.com (August 24, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[Linux distribution]]s.&lt;ref name="ubunutu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fedora"/&gt;&lt;ref name="debian"/&gt;

Latest stable release branch is 0.0.62 with updates from 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/p/opencity/code/HEAD/tree/branches/0.0.6/ HEAD/tree/branches/0.0.6/] on [[sourceforge.net]]&lt;/ref&gt; while the unstable development branch 0.0.7 has updates until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/p/opencity/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/opencity/ HEAD/tree/trunk/opencity/] on [[sourceforge.net]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception == 
OpenCity achieved a broad spread as [[free and open-source]] and [[freeware]] video game,&lt;ref name=macobserver/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerbild.de/download/OpenCity-2255175.html OpenCity] on [[computerbild.de]] (May 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; and was downloaded directly from [[Sourceforge]] between 2003 and May 2017 over 190,000 times according to the SF download statistic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencity/files/stats/timeline?dates=2003-04-23+to+2017-07-16 opencity - stats] on [[sourceforge.net]] (May 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; OpenCity was also directly integrated in many [[Linux distribution]]s: [[Fedora (linux distribution)|Fedora]],&lt;ref name="Fedora"&gt;[http://rpms.remirepo.net/rpmphp/zoom.php?rpm=opencity Package: opencity] on rpms.remirepo.net&lt;/ref&gt; [[Debian]],&lt;ref name="debian"&gt;[https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=sourcenames&amp;keywords=opencity opencity] on packages.debian.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arch Linux]], [[SUSE Linux|SuSE]], [[Slackware]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]],&lt;ref name="ubunutu"&gt;[https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/opencity/ OpenCity] on apps.ubuntu.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pardus (operating system)|Pardus]], [[Frugalware]]. ''OpenCity'' has been reviewed as "well made 3D [[Video game remake|remake]]" of SimCity by [[Chip.de]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="chip"&gt;[http://www.chip.de/downloads/OpenCity_23170816.html OpenCity 0.0.6.2] on [[Chip.de]] ''"OpenCity ist ein liebevoll gemachtes 3D-Remake des Spiele-Klassikers SimCity aus dem Jahre 1989."''

'''Student Human Rights Ordinance''' ({{lang-ko|학생인권조례}}) is an [[local ordinance|ordinance]] in operation in some cities and provinces in [[South Korea]]. It first began in [[Gyeonggi Province|Gyeonggi]] (2010) and expanded to [[Gwangju]] (2011), [[Seoul]] (2012), and the [[North Jeolla Province|Jeollabuk-do Province]] (2013) (North Jeolla Province). The primary objective of this ordinance is to guarantee [[Student rights|human rights of student]] and [[Youth rights|youth]] in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.sen.go.kr/lims/front/law.html?pAct=view&amp;pPromulgationNo=2854 |title=Seoul Student Human Rights Ordinance |last=Kim |first=Yeong-sam |date=January 26, 2012 |website=Legal Public Administration Service, Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education |accessdate=January 21, 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions Between Ordinances==

The four ordinances are very similar, however some cities neglected certain rights and actions. The Gyeonggi-do Student Human Rights Ordinance and [[Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights]] are the only two to include the right to not be discriminated against due to pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/자치법규/경기도학생인권조례/(04853,20150227)/제5조|title=Gyeonggi-do Student Human Rights Ordinance Chapter 2, Section 1, Article 5|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/자치법규/서울특별시학생인권조례/(06793,20180104)/제5조|title=Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights Chapter 2, Section 1, Article 5|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rights surrounding gender and sexuality differs in each location. The Seoul ordinance as well as Gyeonggi-do ordinance include sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/자치법규/서울특별시학생인권조례/(06793,20180104)/제28조|title=Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights, Chapter 2, Section 10, Article 28|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/자치법규/경기도학생인권조례/(04853,20150227)/제27조|title=Gyeonggi-do Ordinance of Student Human Rights, Chapter 2, Section 10, Article 27|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gwangju ordinance only includes sexual orientation and Jeollabuk-do only includes gender equality. Seoul, Jeollabuk-do and Gyeonggi-do each dedicate a day to celebrate Student Human Rights Day in efforts to expand interest and participation in the human rights of the student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/자치법규/서울특별시학생인권조례/(06793,20180104)/제37조|title=Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights, Chapter 3, Section 2, Article 37|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/자치법규/전라북도학생인권조례/(03883,20140808)/제28조|title=Jeollabuk-do Ordinance of Student Right, Chapter 3, Section 1, Article 28|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/자치법규/경기도학생인권조례/(04853,20150227)/제28조|title=Gyeonggi-do Ordinance of Student Human Rights, Chapter 3, Section 1, Article 28|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gwangju has not created a day devoted to student human rights. Seoul’s ordinance mandates that basic human rights must always be upheld even if they are not listed in the ordinance.

The ordinances state that each city and province has to stay updated on a plan to ensure human rights. In Gwangju there is a survey conducted every two years to keep the human rights plan up to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/자치법규/광주광역시학생인권보장및증진에관한조례/(04017,20111028)/제5조|title=Gwangju Ordinance of Student Rights, Chapter 2, Article 5|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Gyeonggi-do, the Superintendent of Public Instruction conducts an annual survey on student human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/자치법규/경기도학생인권조례/(04853,20150227)/제33조|title=Gyeoggi-do Ordinance of Student Human Rights, Chapter 3, Section 2, Article 33|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Seoul, the Superintendent conducts an annual survey on the actual conditions of student human rights and reflect the results in the drafting of the comprehensive human rights plan for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/자치법규/서울특별시학생인권조례/(06793,20180104)/제45조|title=Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights, Chapter 3, Section 5, Article 45|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jeollabuk-do, the Chancellor conducts a survey on the condition of student human rights every year to reflect them in the education of human rights of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/자치법규/전라북도학생인권조례/(03883,20140808)/제33조|title=Jeollabuk-do Ordinance of Student Rights, Chapter 3, Section 2, Article 33|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''public university''' is a [[university]] that is publicly owned or receives significant [[public funds]] through a national or subnational government, as opposed to a [[private university]]. Whether a [[national university]] is considered public varies from one country (or region) to another, largely depending on the specific education landscape.

{{See also|List of universities in Tunisia}}
In Tunisia, the [[Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (Tunisia)|Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research]] controls all of the public universities. For some universities, the ministry of higher education coordinates with other ministries like: the Ministry of Public health or the [[Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies (Tunisia)|Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies]]. Admission in a public university in Tunisia is assured after successfully succeeding in the [[Tunisian Baccalaureate]]: Students are classified according to a Formula score based on their results in the Baccalaureate. Then, the students make a wishlist with the universities they want to attend on a state website dedicated for orientation. Thus, the high-ranking-students get priority to choose.

examples of Tunisian public universities:

* [[Carthage University]], [[Carthage]]
* [[Ez-Zitouna University]], [[Tunis]]

===China===
{{see also|List of universities in China|Higher education in China}}

In mainland China, nearly all universities and research institutions are public and currently, all important and significant centers for higher education in the country are publicly administered.

The public universities are usually run by the [[provinces of China|provincial]] governments; there are also circumstances where the [[Direct-controlled municipalities of China#Current PRC Municipalities|municipal]] governments administer the universities. Some public universities are [[National university|national]], which are directly administered by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|central government]].

Private undergraduate colleges do exist, which are mostly vocational colleges sponsored by private enterprises. The majority of such universities are not entitled to award bachelor's degrees. Public universities usually enjoy higher reputation domestically.

===Hong Kong===
{{see also|List of universities in Hong Kong}}
Eight institutions are funded by the [[University Grants Committee (Hong Kong)|University Grants Committee]].

===India===
{{see also|List of universities in India}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
In India, most universities and nearly all research institutions are public. There are some private undergraduate colleges, mostly engineering schools, but a majority of these are affiliated to public universities. Some of these private schools are also partially aided by the national or state governments. India also has an "open" public university, the [[Indira Gandhi National Open University]] (IGNOU), which mostly offers distance education, and in terms of the number of enrolled students is now the largest university in the world with over 4 million students.

===Iran===
Some of Iran's prestigious universities are public. State-run universities are highly selective. Iran's best known private university is [[Islamic Azad University]] with campuses all around the country.

===Israel===
{{see also|List of Israeli universities and colleges}}
There are nine official universities in [[Israel]]. In addition, there are a few dozen colleges and other institutes of higher learning, as well as about a dozen foreign university extensions. All are academically supervised by the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel]] (CHEI). The main difference between a university and a college in Israel is that only a university can issue [[doctorate]] degrees. Theoretically, a college can apply to the CHEI to upgrade its status to university.

===Japan===
{{see also|Higher education in Japan}}
In Japan, public universities refer to schools that are not [[national university|national universities]] but are run by local governments, either prefectural or municipal. According to the [[Ministry of Education (Japan)|Ministry of Education]], public universities have "provided an opportunity for higher education in a region and served the central role of intellectual and cultural base for the local community in the region", and are "expected to contribute to social, economical and cultural development in the region";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/koutou/kouritsu/|script-title=ja:公立大学について|trans-title=About public universities in Japan|accessdate=2011-09-07|language=Japanese|quote=[...] とりわけ公立大学は、その目的に加え、地方公共団体が設置・管理するという性格から、地域における高等教育機会の提供と、地域社会での知的・文化的拠点として中心的役割を担ってきており、今後とも、それぞれの地域における社会・経済・文化への貢献が期待されています。[...](Translation&lt;!--(possibly broken...)--&gt;: [...] Especially, the public university, because of its goal as well as nature of the institute established and administered by local governments, has begun to offer opportunity of higher education and take the central role as informational and cultural center in regional community and has been expected to contribute to society, economics and culture in each community from now on. [...])}}&lt;/ref&gt; this contrasts to research-oriented aspects of national universities.

As of 2010, there were 95 public universities, compared to 86 [[national university|national universities]] and 597 private universities, and 127,872 students attended the schools. The number of the public universities has increased sharply in recent years; in 1980 there were only 34 public universities and in 1993 there were 46. Since July 2003 when the [[Local Independent Administrative Institutions Law]] was put into effect, public universities have been allowed to be incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/hakusho/html/hpac200301/hpac200301_2_023.html|title=FY2003 White Paper on Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [1.2.1.3]|year=2003|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average tuition in public universities for 2007 fiscal year was 536,238 yen, the average entrance fee 399,351 yen and the average application fee 17,095 yen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/koutou/kouritsu/jyugyou/07062930.htm|script-title=ja:平成19年度学生納付金調査結果－文部科学省|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 20 public universities in Malaysia, which  are funded by the government but governed as self-managed institutions.

===Nepal===
[[Tribhuvan University]] is the first public university of [[Nepal]]. The university is highly reputed both in Nepal as well as abroad, and runs various programs in a wide number of academic disciplines. It operates through six different schools, and also provides affiliation to various colleges across the country. [[Kathmandu University]] is also the public university of [[Nepal]] founded by government act in 1991. Due to high fee and single person's administration, many people think that this university is a private university, but it is not (see [[kathmandu University]] type). The university offers new and demanding subjects especially in the field of science and technology through different schools. There is another government funded Pokhara University. It was established in 1997 under Pokhara University Act. Pokhara University, non-profit autonomous institution, is financed by the Government of Nepal. Pokhara University has given affiliation to around 58 colleges for Bachelor, Master and M. Phil degree programs. Pokhara University has gained popularity in recent years. It has relation already established with 42 national and international Universities.

In [[Pakistan]], universities receive guidance and recognition by the [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)]] (HEC) (formerly the University Grants Commission (Pakistan)). There are around 107 public and 76 private universities in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.hec.gov.pk/universityfinal2/RegionUniversity.aspx List of Public and Private Universities in Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309182020/http://app.hec.gov.pk/universityfinal2/RegionUniversity.aspx |date=2008-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of the Punjab]] is the biggest public university followed by [[University of Karachi]].

===Philippines===

{{see also|Higher education in the Philippines|State university and college (Philippines)|Local college and university (Philippines)}}
Universities and colleges in the Philippines are controlled and managed by the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]], especially the [[University of the Philippines]]. There are more than 500 government-run higher education institutions, of which 436 are state colleges and universities, including satellite campuses, 31 local colleges and universities, and a handful of community colleges. In 2008, through Republic Act 9500, the University of the Philippines was bestowed as the National University to distinguish it from all other state universities and colleges.

Aside from the University of the Philippines, there are other notable state colleges and universities within the archipelago. These include the [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines]], [[Technological University of the Philippines]], [[Philippine Normal University]], and [[Mindanao State University]].

In 2008, state colleges and universities have a [[Philippine peso|PHP]] 26.2-billion budget, out of which [[Philippine peso|PHP]] 19.4 billion will be funded by direct subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/101294/RP-universities-get-low-rankings-La-Salle-UST-dropped-out-of-Top-500 GMA NEWS.TV, RP universities get low rankings; La Salle, UST dropped out of Top 500].

In [[Sri Lanka]] only fifteen universities are public universities, with most funded by government via the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]] which handles undergraduate placements and staff appointments. Therefore, these are not independent institutions.

In recent years large numbers of private institutions have opened islandwide, and even small tuition classes offer degree courses and claim to be 'universities'. No state body to regulate the fees and standard of education.

===Taiwan, Republic of China===
[[Taiwan]] has more than 150 universities (two-thirds were established after the 1980s), while only a third of them are public universities. Tuition fees at public universities are less than half those of private universities because the Taiwan government puts more funding to the public universities. Additionally, there are ten public universities (established before the 1980s) which are more accredited and more prestigious in Taiwan and the majority of top-ranking schools are public. Therefore, most students choose public universities for their tertiary education.

===Thailand===
[[File:Main auditorium of Chulalongkorn University IMG 0338.jpg|thumb|Chulalongkorn University main auditorium in Thailand]]
Currently, Thailand has 24 public universities.

In the late 19th century, there was a high demand for professional talents in the  central government of [[Thailand]]. ''Siam'' was an aftermath of King Rama V's bureaucratic reforms, which aimed to transform the feudal Thai society into a modernized state. In 1899, the King founded the School for Training of Civil Officials (Thai: โรงเรียนสำหรับฝึกหัดวิชาข้าราชการฝ่ายพลเรือน) near the northern gate of the Royal Palace. Those who graduated from the School would become royal ''pages''. Being royal pages, he must learn how to administrate organization by working closely with the King, which is a traditional way of entrance to the Siamese bureaucracy. After being royal pages, he would then served in the Mahattai Ministry or other government ministries.

==Europe==

===Continental Europe===
*{{flag|Austria}}: Most of the universities are public. The tuition fees are also regulated by the state and are the same for all public universities. Except for some studies, notably medicine, everybody who passes the "Matura" exam to attend university has the right to attend any public university. Overrun subjects will introduce entrance exams that students have to pass in the first year or prior to starting the degree. Especially scientific subjects such as biology, chemistry and physics will have difficult exams in the first year of studies which introduce a certain barrier. Students have to create their own timetables following the curriculum they choose. The universities provide options to combine studies and follow individually adjusted curricula, but the organisation is obliged to the student and administration involved is high. Private universities have existed since 1999 but are considered easier than public Universities and thus hold less esteem. 
*{{flag|Croatia}}: Most universities are public and run by the state. Academically well-performing students pay only administrative fees (less than €100 per year). Only those who fail multiple classes in a year, and have to retake them, pay a partial or full tuition fee.
*{{flag|Denmark}}: Almost all universities are public and are held in higher esteem than their private counterparts. Attending university is free in Denmark.
*{{flag|Finland}}: All universities are public and free of charge.
*{{flag|France}}: Most higher education organizations (universities and [[grande école|grandes écoles]]) are public and charge very low tuition fees (around €400 per year). Major exceptions are business schools such as [[HEC School of Management]]. Article L731-14 of the "Code de l'éducation" states that "Private higher education establishments can in no case take the title of "university"". But many private institutions such as the [[Catholic University of Lyon]], use "university" as their marketing name. 
*{{flag|Germany}}: Most higher education institutions are public and operated by the [[States of Germany|states]] and all professors are public servants. In general, public universities are held in higher esteem than their private counterparts. From 1972 through 1998, public universities were free of tuition fees; since then, however, some states have adopted low tuition fees.
*{{flag|Greece}}: All universities are public and enjoy ''de jure'' institutional autonomy, although in practice this autonomy is limited by ministerial interventions in issues such as student enrolment, academic recruitment and funding. With the exception of the [[Hellenic Open University]], undergraduate programmes are offered tuition-free for Greek citizens, as are many post-graduate courses. Education is regarded as a constitutional responsibility of the state and the establishment of private universities is prohibited by the constitution. 
*{{flag|Italy}}: Almost all the universities are public, but they enjoy de jure institutional autonomy (limited by the state in practice, like in Greece). The majority of the funds came from the state and, therefore, students pay quite low tuition fees, decided by each university and related mainly to the student's family wealth, to the course and to the student's performances in the exams. A few scholarships, both at undergraduate and postgraduate level, are also available for the best low-income students. Private funding, even for research, ranges from low to non-existent, compared to most other European countries.
*{{flag|The Netherlands}}: Almost all universities are public and are largely funded by the Ministry of Education. Dutch citizens and citizens of other European Union countries who are enrolling for their first Bachelor and/or first Master level degree are subject to an annually adjusted, yearly tuition fee regardless of University or program. The fee was set at 1,951 euros in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://duo.nl/zakelijk/ho/BRON_HO_Nieuw/collegegeld/collegegeld.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222205634/http://www.duo.nl/zakelijk/ho/BRON_HO_Nieuw/collegegeld/collegegeld.asp |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-European Union students, and students who want to complete a second Bachelor or master's degree pay the 'legal school fee' which should cover the additional costs of the student, which is no longer funded by the government. These fees range between approximately 7,000 (for relatively cheap bachelor programs) and 30,000 euros (for master programs in medicine) a year. All universities are supervised by the Ministry of Education, even the private ones. 
*{{flag|Norway}}: Almost all universities are public and state funded.
*{{flag|Poland}}: Universities are divided into a few categories; private universities which are operated by private citizens, societies or companies, and public universities created by Acts of Parliament. The Government pays all tuition fees, and other costs of students. Most private universities charge tuition fees directly to students, and these institutions are generally held in lower regard than public universities. A small number of private universities do not charge fees, such as [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin]], founded in 1918 and property of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Episcopacy]] of Poland; the Polish Government pays all costs.
*{{flag|Portugal}}: There are [[list of universities in Portugal|13 public universities]], a [[university institute]] and a [[distance university]]. [[Higher education in Portugal]] provided by state-run institutions is not free, as a tuition fee must be paid, although being much lower than the tuition fees of the private ones. The highest tuition fee allowed by law in public universities is €1063 per year, as of 2017. The public universities include some of the most selective and demanding higher learning institutions in the country, noted for high competitiveness and nationwide reputation.
*{{flag|Spain}}: There are a total of 74 universities. Most of them (52), including the most prestigious ones, are public, and are funded by the [[autonomous community]] in which they are based. As such, university funding may differ (though not significantly) depending on which Spanish region the university is based on. However, the central government establishes by law homogeneous tuition fees for all public universities, and as such university fees are much lower than those of their private counterparts. The highest tuition fee allowed by law was, as of 2010, of 14.97 euros per academic credit, amounting to roughly 840 euros/year for an average 60 credit full-time course;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.um.es/estudios/normas-academicas/2010-2011/precios-publicos.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927122839/http://www.um.es/estudios/normas-academicas/2010-2011/precios-publicos.pdf|date=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; tuition fees in private universities might reach 18,000 euros/year in comparison. Public universities are state-owned but granted a considerable degree of independence when it comes to self-government; they cannot, however, make free use of their assets (i.e., buy and sell assets as a private company would), and are subject to Spanish administrative law as any other public body of the state. In turn, public university administrators, lecturers and professors are granted civil servant status, which serves as a tenure because only under exceptional and very well justified circumstances can a civil servant lose his job under Spanish law. Research funding can be allocated either by the autonomous community or by the central government; in the former case, funding amount and conditions vary greatly from one autonomous community to another.
*{{flag|Sweden}}: Most universities are public. [[Education in Sweden]] is normally free, so there are no tuition fees at any university in Sweden.

===Ireland===
{{see also|List of higher education institutions in the Republic of Ireland}}
In Ireland, nearly all [[List of universities in the Republic of Ireland|universities]], [[Regional Technical College|institutes of technology]], [[College of Education|colleges of education]] and some other third-level institutions are public, and the state pays the cost of educating its undergraduates. There are a few private institutions of higher learning, for example the [[National College of Ireland]] but none of them have university status and they are highly specialised.

===Russia===

In Russia, about 7.5 million students study in thousands of universities.

===Turkey===
For academic year 2016, there are 183 [[university|universities]] and [[academies]] total in [[Turkey]]: 118 of them are [[Public University|State Universities]] (five of which are [[Technical University|technical universities]], two of which are [[Institute of Technology|institutes of technology]], and one of which is [[fine arts]] university). Turkey's higher learning institutions, governed by Ministry of Higher Education or YOK Ministry, are accepting more and more international students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studyinturkey.com/content/sub/turkey_grows_as_destination_for_international_students.aspx Study In Turkey].

{{See also|Universities in the United Kingdom}}
In the UK, an institution can only use the title "university" or "university college" if it has been granted by the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]], under the terms of the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].&lt;ref name="privy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page27.asp |title=Higher Education |accessdate=6 December 2007|publisher=[[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1992, these titles were conferred by [[Royal charter#United Kingdom|Royal Charter]], [[Act of Parliament]], or (for the [[ancient universities]]) customary usage.

Most British universities are partly publicly funded and regulated: the government regulates their tuition fees, student funding and student loans and commissions and regulates research assessments and teaching reviews. Unlike in Continental European countries, the British government does not own universities' assets, and university staff are not civil servants: government regulation arises as a condition of accepting funding from bodies such as [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|HEFCE]] and any university can in principle choose to leave the HEFCE regulated system at any time.&lt;ref name='OXCHEPS39'&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/MainSite%20pages/Resources/OxCHEPS_OP39.pdf|title = OFFA and £6000-9000 tuition fees| accessdate =20 March 2011|last = Dennis|first=Farrington|author2=David Palfreyman |date =21 February 2011|format=PDF| work = OxCHEPS Occasional Paper No. 39|publisher=Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies|quote=Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College).

In Australia, there are 38 public universities and 3 private universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Group of Eight|title=The Australian Higher Education System|url=https://www.go8.edu.au/page/australian-higher-education-system}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private universities are [[Bond University]], the [[University of Notre Dame Australia]], and [[Torrens University Australia]]. There are also two foreign universities, [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (USA) and [[Cranfield University]] (UK), which have campuses in [[Adelaide]].

Some part of Australia's public universities are variously grouped as below:
* Some of the [[Group of Eight (Australian universities)|Group of Eight]] are the oldest and prestigious public universities in Australia and include the Universities of [[University of Queensland|Queensland]], [[University of Sydney|Sydney]], [[University of Melbourne|Melbourne]], [[University of New South Wales|New South Wales]], [[University of Adelaide|Adelaide]] and [[University of Western Australia|Western Australia]] together with the [[Australian National University]] and [[Monash University]]. Three were established in the 19th century.
* The [[Australian Technology Network]] universities largely grew from the former Institutes of Technology and include [[RMIT University]], [[Queensland University of Technology]], [[Curtin University]], the [[University of Technology Sydney]] and the [[University of South Australia]]. They gained university status in the late 1980s to the early 1990s as a result of the reforms of the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, [[John Dawkins]].
* [[Innovative Research Universities Australia|Innovative Research Universities]] represent a number of research-intensive institutions, with most being established in the 1960s and 1970s. The group includes [[Charles Darwin University]], [[Flinders University]], [[Griffith University]], [[James Cook University]], [[La Trobe University]], [[Murdoch University]] and [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]].
* The [[Regional Universities Network]] is a group of six universities which mainly come from regional Australia, as well as campuses in the Australian capital cities and some international campuses. The group includes [[Central Queensland University]], [[Southern Cross University]], [[Federation University]], the [[University of Southern Queensland]], the [[University of the Sunshine Coast]] and the [[University of New England (Australia)]].
* The NUW Alliance is a group of three universities which are located in [[New South Wales]]. The group consists of [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]], [[University of New South Wales]], and [[University of Wollongong]].

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, all eight universities are public. Public funding is supported by research grants. The oldest ([[University of Otago]]) was established in 1869 by [[Provinces of New Zealand|Provincial Ordinance]]. From 1870 to 1961, there was effectively a single university structure - the [[University of New Zealand]] - with constituent colleges located in [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Dunedin]]. In 1961, the constituent colleges were dissolved into four independent universities by the New Zealand Parliament to become the [[University of Auckland]], [[Victoria University of Wellington]], [[University of Canterbury]] and [[University of Otago]]. This change also established a new university in Hamilton, the [[University of Waikato]]. Two associated agricultural colleges - [[Massey University|Massey]] and [[Lincoln University, New Zealand|Lincoln]] - subsequently become universities in 1963 and 1990 respectively. An eighth university ([[Auckland University of Technology]]) was formed in 2000 by an [[Order in Council]] under the Education Act 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=196216&amp;infobase=pal_regs.nfo&amp;record={61C0649C}&amp;hitsperheading=on&amp;softpage=DOC New Zealand Legislation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318234516/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=196216&amp;infobase=pal_regs.nfo&amp;record=%7B61C0649C%7D&amp;hitsperheading=on&amp;softpage=DOC |date=2015-03-18 }}.

{{See also|Universities in Canada}}

In Canada, education is a [[Constitution of Canada|constitutional]] responsibility of the individual [[Provinces of Canada|provinces]]. Many early universities were privately endowed (e.g. [[McGill University|McGill]]) or founded by church denominations (e.g. [[Université Laval|Laval]], [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary's]], [[Queen's University|Queen's]], [[Dalhousie University|Dalhousie]], [[Mount Allison University|Mount Allison]], [[McMaster University|McMaster]], [[University of Ottawa|Ottawa]]) but in the 20th century became publicly funded and secular. Provincial governments established the [[University of Toronto]] on the [[Oxbridge]] model and elsewhere ([[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]] etc.) in the pattern of American state universities. All major Canadian universities are now publicly funded but maintain institutional autonomy, with the ability to decide on admission, tuition and governance.

The [[U15 (universities)|U15]] is an organization of the country's fifteen leading research-intensive universities. Additionally, [[McGill University]] and the [[University of Toronto]] are members of the [[Association of American Universities]], along with sixty public and private institutions in the United States. Private universities in Canada are relatively new and mostly exist at the [[undergraduate]] level.

===Mexico===

In Mexico, the [[UNAM]] (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México), sometimes simply known as the "National University of Mexico", was founded in 1910. It is the largest university in the country and one of the largest in the world with over 250,000 students including its system of high schools. By percentage, it contributes the most to the country's academic research and cultural development although there are other significant public institutions such as the [[National Polytechnic Institute|Instituto Politécnico Nacional]], and the federal state-run universities.

{{See also|List of state universities in the United States}}

In the United States, most public universities are [[State university system|state universities]] founded and operated by [[U.S. state|state]] government entities.

States generally charge higher tuition to out-of-state students. The higher fees are based on the theory that students from the state, or much more often their parents, have contributed to subsidizing the university by paying state taxes, while out-of-state students and their parents have not.

Every U.S. state has at least one public university to its name and the largest states have more than thirty. This is partly as a result of the 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Land-Grant Acts]], which gave each eligible state {{convert|30000|acres|0|abbr=on}} of federal land to sell to finance public institutions offering courses of study in practical fields in addition to the liberal arts. With the help of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]] and the [[Education Amendments of 1972]], public universities became even more accessible for women, minorities and lower income applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiener|first=Robert|title=Future of Public Universities|publisher=CQ Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public universities generally rely on subsidies from their respective [[state government]]. "The historical data for private and public institutions reveal that public institutions have always been more dependent on external support than have private institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Robert E. "Why Tuition Costs Are Rising So Quickly." Challenge Volume 45, Number 4 (2002): pp. 88-108. JSTOR. Web. 13 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, state support of public universities has been declining, forcing many public universities to seek private support. The real level of state funding for public higher education has doubled from $30 billion in 1974 to nearly $60 billion in 2000. Meanwhile, the percent of state appropriations for the cost of schooling per student at public university has fallen from 78% in 1974 to 43% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, Michael J. "State Preferences for Higher Education Spending: A Panel Data Analysis, 1977–2001." What's Happening to Public Higher Education? Ed. [[Ronald G. Ehrenberg]]. Westport: Praeger Publishers, 2006. pp. 3-35.&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing use of teaching assistants in public universities is a testament to waning state support.&lt;ref&gt;Bettinger, Eric P. and Bridget Terry Long. "The Increasing Use of Adjunct Instructors at Public Institutions: Are We Hurting Students?" What's Happening to Public Higher Education? Ed. [[Ronald G. Ehrenberg]]. Westport: Praeger Publishers, 2006. pp. 51-69. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; To compensate, some professional graduate programs in law, business, and medicine rely almost solely on private funding.

The oldest public universities are the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], [[Rutgers University]], and [[University of Georgia|The University of Georgia]], although the overall oldest university now designated as public is [[The College of William &amp; Mary]], which was founded by a [[Charter#Royal Charter|Crown charter]] in 1693 and was originally a private institution. The [[University of South Carolina]] (1801) is the longest continuously supported public university; [[Ohio University]] (1804) is the oldest public university in continuous operation.{{refn|group=n|[[Vincennes University]] was founded in 1801 and has continuously operated, but did not become a public institution until 1806, and has been primarily a two-year institution since 1889. Rutgers, which did not become a public institution until 1945, closed twice prior to 1825. The [[University of Tennessee]] was chartered in 1794, but did not receive state funds until 1807, and then closed from 1809 to 1820. William &amp; Mary, North Carolina, Georgia, and South Carolina all closed during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], with W&amp;M not reopening until 1888.}}

Many U.S. public universities began as [[Normal school|teacher training institutions]] and eventually were expanded into comprehensive universities. Examples include UCLA, formerly the southern branch of [[California State Normal School]]; [[Arizona State University]], originally the [[History of Arizona State University|Tempe Normal School]]; the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]], formerly [[Milwaukee Normal School]]; and [[Missouri State University]], formerly Southwest Missouri State Teachers College.

It has never been determined whether the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] would allow the [[Federal Government of the United States|federal government]] to establish a federal university system; the only federally chartered public universities that currently exist are the [[United States Service academies]], military-associated educational institutions administered by the [[United States Department of Defense]], and [[Haskell Indian Nations University]], which is governed by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. In addition, [[Georgetown University]] was the first federally chartered private university in [[Washington, D.C.]] (1815), and was later followed by other colleges and universities in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], including [[Gallaudet University]] (1864), [[Howard University]] (1867), and [[American University]] (1893). 

Historically, many of the prestigious universities in the United States have been private, most notably the [[Ivy League]]. However, some public universities are also highly prestigious and increasingly selective: [[Richard Moll (author)|Richard Moll]] designated such prestigious public universities [[Public Ivies]]. [[UC Berkeley]], for instance, is often [[College and university rankings|ranked]] as a top-ten university in the world and the top [[public universities|public university]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings?int=a27a09|title=Top World University Rankings {{!}} US News Best Global Universities|website=www.usnews.com|accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/World-University-Rankings/University-of-California-Berkeley.html|title=University of California, Berkeley {{!}} Academic Ranking of World Universities - 2017 {{!}} Shanghai Ranking - 2017|website=www.shanghairanking.com|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-boasts-world-s-top-public-universities|title=UC boasts the world’s top public universities|date=2017-08-17|work=University of California|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats|title=World University Rankings|last=|first=|date=September 30, 2015|website=|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2016/reputation-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank_label/sort_order/asc/cols/rank_only|title=World Reputation Rankings|date=April 21, 2016|accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cwur.org/2017.php|title=CWUR 2017 {{!}} Top Universities in the World|website=cwur.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/top-public|title=Top Public Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/world-university-rankings-blog-how-university-superbrands-compare#survey-answer|title=World University Rankings blog: how the 'university superbrands' compare|date=2016-05-10|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/six-superbrands-their-reputations-precede-them/415436.article|title=Six 'superbrands': their reputations precede them|date=2011-03-10|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of public [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]], including the members of the [[Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges]].

==Central America==

===Costa Rica===
In [[Costa Rica]] the [[Universidad de Costa Rica]], the Universidad Nacional, the Universidad Estatal a Distancia, Universidad Técnica Nacional and the [[Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica]], all public universities, are among the most prestigious institutions, while the UN-sponsored University for Peace and the [[INCAE]] Business School (with campuses in [[Nicaragua]] and Costa Rica) are equally notable.

==South America==

===Argentina===
[[File:UBA-Facultad-Derecho.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Buenos Aires]] is a public university in Argentina.]]
{{see also|List of universities in Argentina}}
In [[Argentina]] the [[National Universities]], also called "Public or State-run Universities", is the name used to refer to all those institutions whose creation arose from the enactment of a National Congress Act, except for those whose creation preceded that of the state itself (as is the case of the [[National University of Córdoba]] and the [[University of Buenos Aires]]). They lie as Public Law legal entities and their regular operation funding comes from the national state, pursuant to what is set out on the annual national budget act.

National universities hold the largest share of the entire Argentine university system: counting over 80% of the undergraduate population and with campuses stretched throughout to all provinces comprising the national territory, they account for over 50% of the country's scientific research while additionally providing technical assistance to both the public and private sectors.

Public universities are absolutely free (no fee is paid during the studies), as is the access to books in the universities' libraries. Buying in bookstores and studying material (such as photocopies of books which are very common) is, however, usually paid for by each student. For low-income students there is a great variety of scholarships.

===Brazil===
{{main article|Universities and higher education in Brazil#Public and Private Universities}}
{{see also|List of public Brazilian universities}}
[[File:Universidade Federal do Parana 4 Curitiba Parana.jpg|thumb|[[Federal University of Paraná]], in [[Curitiba]], Brazil'']]

In Brazil, there are a few hundred public universities funded by the Federal or State governments, and they include the most renowned universities in the country, such as the [[University of São Paulo]], [[University of Campinas]], [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]], [[Federal University of Minas Gerais]], [[Federal University of Bahia]], and the Federal Institutes. Professors are public servants, most of them tenured and selected by public contests, where international research publications is a major criterion for hiring. Teaching load is usually modest and leaves time for research. In contrast, most private institutions are for-profit enterprises which hire teachers on a per-hour basis and have little research when compared with the public ones, notable exceptions are certain private but non-profit universities, mostly affiliated with religious organizations, such as the [[Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie]] of São Paulo and the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro]]. Public universities are responsible for granting nearly all the graduate degrees in Brazil, such as doctoral and masters (called in Portuguese, respectively, "doutorado" and "mestrado"). These graduate programs in public universities are also the main source of Brazilian academic research.

There are no tuition or entrance fees in public universities (a right established in the Brazilian Federal Constitution), but since they have thousands of applicants every year, because there are no tuitions or fees, only the best students can pass the entrance examination. In many Universities, there are quotas for students whose secondary (high school) education was made entirely in a public funded school (generally, the quota is 50%), and there are also racial quotas, but usually restricted to students from public high school too. Some Universities, like [[Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais|UFMG]], the largest federal university in Brazil, give extra points in their admission tests instead of quotas. In UFMG a public high school student is granted a 10% bonus over his test grade, if he previously agrees to receive this advantage. Public school students that declare themselves as blacks or "pardos" (mixed race) have a 15% bonus, also if they previously agree to receive race based benefits. In recent years public funded higher education has grown a lot. Since 2005 the Brazilian Government has been offering a limited number of tuition grants to enable poor students to attend private universities.

===Chile===
[[File:Frontis de la Casa Central de la Universidad de Chile, 2005.jpg|thumb|Casa Central (Headquarters), Universidad de Chile'']]
{{see also|2011 student protests in Chile}}
In [[Chile]], older, so called "traditional" universities are more prestigious than the ones created after 1980. Even though some of those "traditional" universities are non-profit private entities, they belong to same superior university council called ''Consejo de Rectores'' (Council of Chancellors); the ''Consejo de Rectores'' runs its own admission system called ''Prueba de Selección Universitaria'' or ''PSU'', which is roughly similar to [[SAT]]. Even though state run universities are much cheaper than the private ones, they are not tuition free for the students. It is remarkable that Chile spends only 4% in education, compared to the 7% of GDP recommended by the UN for developed nations. And in Chile the financing of higher education, private and public, is contributed by 75% by self-effort of families. The most prestigious universities in Chile are the state run [[Universidad de Chile]], the private with State contributions [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile]], the private with State contributions [[Universidad de Concepción]] and the private with state contributions [[Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María]], these four universities admit the largest numbers of high scoring students in the PSU admission test and are responsible for the largest portion of research (with the Universidad de Chile at the top). The non-traditional universities are, the most part, for-profit universities, and, with a few exceptions, don't have the same prestige as the above "traditional" ones.

===Peru===
[[File:CCSM-UNMSM Casona de San Marcos y Parque Univesitario.jpg|thumb|The historical campus of the [[National University of San Marcos]].]]
In [[Peru]], the admission test required to enter national (public) universities requires higher scores. The public opinion sees this from the four century old [[National University of San Marcos]] (the oldest university of the Americas, founded in May 1551), that it has seen as the most respected public education institution in the country. Also many other public universities follow the same rigorous pattern used at San Marcos university, like [[National Agrarian University]], the [[National University of Engineering]] and Federico Villarreal University.

The '''Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR)''' is a searchable international database indexing the creation, location and growth of [[open access]] [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]] and their contents. ROAR was created by [[EPrints]] at [[University of Southampton]], UK, in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, T, Carr, L, Hey, JMN, Brown, A, Hitchcock, S (2007) PRONOM-ROAR: [http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/viewFile/53/25 Adding Format Profiles to a Repository Registry to Inform Preservation Services].

As of 2015, ROAR and the UK-based [[Directory of Open Access Repositories]] (OpenDOAR) "are considered the two leading open access [[Web directory|directories]] worldwide. ROAR is the larger directory and allows direct submissions to the directory. OpenDOAR controls submission of materials and is dependent on the discretion of its staff. OpenDOAR requires open access of scholarly publications; whereas ROAR allows other types of materials to be included. ROAR allows filtering by country, type of repository, and sorting by repository name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Patricia H. Dawson |author2= Sharon Q.

==ROARMAP==
ROAR's companion '''Registry of Open Access Repository Mandates and Policies''' (ROARMAP) is a searchable international database of policies.

'''Robert Bly''' (born December 23, 1926) is an American poet, essayist, activist and leader of the [[mythopoetic men's movement]]. His best-known book is ''[[Iron John: A Book About Men]]'' (1990),&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite web |title=Iron John: A Book About Men |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294469/Iron-John-A-Book-About-Men |date= |publisher=[[Britannica.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; a key text of the mythopoetic men's movement, which spent 62 weeks on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What Do Men Want?

==Life==
Bly was born in [[Lac qui Parle County, Minnesota]], to Jacob and Alice Bly, who were of [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="johnsen"&gt;{{cite web| last =Johnsen| first =Bill| coauthors =| title =The Natural World is a Spiritual House| work =Colloquium on Violence and Religion Annual Conference 2004| pages =| publisher =Girardian Reflections on the Lectionary| date =June 2004| url =http://girardianlectionary.net/covr2004/BJohnsenpaper.pdf| accessdate =April 30, 2007| format =PDF| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070704074252/http://girardianlectionary.net/covr2004/BJohnsenpaper.pdf| archivedate =July 4, 2007| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following graduation from high school in 1944, he enlisted in the United States Navy, serving two years. After one year at [[St. Olaf College]] in [[Minnesota]], he transferred to [[Harvard University]], joining the later famous group of writers who were undergraduates at that time, including [[Donald Hall]], Will Morgan, [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Kenneth Koch]], [[Frank O'Hara]], [[John Ashbery]], [[Harold Brodkey]], [[George Plimpton]] and [[John Hawkes (novelist)|John Hawkes]]. He graduated in 1950 and spent the next few years in New York.

Beginning in 1954, Bly spent two years at the [[University of Iowa]] at the [[Iowa Writers Workshop]], completing a master's degree in fine arts, along with [[W. D. Snodgrass]], [[Donald Justice]], and others. In 1956, he received a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Grant]] to travel to [[Norway]] and translate [[Norwegian literature|Norwegian poetry]] into English.  While there, he found not only his relatives, but became acquainted with the work of a number of major poets whose work was barely known in the United States, among them [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Cesar Vallejo]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Gunnar Ekelof]], [[Georg Trakl]], [[Rumi]], [[Hafez (poet)|Hafez]], [[Kabir]], [[Mirabai]], and [[Harry Martinson]]. Bly determined then to start a literary magazine for poetry translation in the United States. ''The Fifties,'' ''The Sixties,'' and ''The Seventies'' introduced many of these poets to the writers of his generation. He also published essays on American poets.

During this time, Bly lived on a farm in Minnesota, with his wife and children. His first marriage was to award-winning short story novelist [[Carol Bly]]. They had four children, including [[Mary Bly]] —a best-selling novelist and Literature Professor at [[Fordham University]] as of 2011— and they divorced in 1979. Since 1980 Bly has been married to the former Ruth Counsell;&lt;ref name="johnsen"/&gt; by that marriage he had a stepdaughter and stepson, although the stepson died in a pedestrian–train incident.

==Career==
Bly's early collection of poems, ''Silence in the Snowy Fields,'' was published in 1962, and its plain, imagistic style had considerable influence on American verse of the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, Mason, and Schoerke, editors. ''Twentieth-Century American Poetics'', p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he published "[[A Wrong Turning in American Poetry]]", an essay in which he argued that the vast majority of American poetry from 1917 to 1963 was lacking in soul and "inwardness" as a result of a focus on impersonality and an objectifying, intellectual view of the world that Bly believed was instigated by the Modernists and formed the aesthetic of most post-World War II American poetry. He criticized the influence of American-born Modernists like [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Ezra Pound|Pound]], [[Marianne Moore]], and [[William Carlos Williams]] and argued that American poetry needed to model itself on the more inward-looking work of European and South American poets like [[Pablo Neruda]], [[César Vallejo]], [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], [[Antonio Machado]], and [[Rainer Maria Rilke]].

In 1966, Bly co-founded [[American Writers Against the Vietnam War]] and went on to lead much of the opposition to that war among writers. In 1968, he signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the war.&lt;ref&gt;"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest", ''New York Post'', January 30, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech accepting the [[National Book Award]] for ''The Light Around the Body'',&lt;ref name=nba1968&gt;[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1968 "National Book Awards – 1968"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved March 3, 2012. (With acceptance speech by Bly and essay by Patrick Rosal from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.)&lt;/ref&gt; he announced that he would be contributing the $1000 prize to draft resistance organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bly|first=Robert|title=National Book Awards acceptance speech|url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nbaacceptspeech_rbly|website=National Book Foundation|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the sixties he was of great help to the Bengali [[Hungryalist]] poets who faced anti-establishment trial at Kolkata, India. Bly became one of the most important of American protest poets during the Vietnam War; his 1970 poem "The Teeth Mother Naked At Last," later collected in his collection Sleepers Joining Hands (1973) is a major contribution to this poetry.  During the 1970s, he published eleven books of poetry, essays, and translations, celebrating the power of myth, Indian [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] poetry, meditation, and storytelling. During the 1980s he published ''Loving a Woman in Two Worlds'', ''The Wingéd Life: Selected Poems and Prose of Thoreau,'' ''The Man in the Black Coat Turns,'' and ''A Little Book on the Human Shadow''.

In 1975, he organized the first annual ''Great Mother Conference''. Throughout the ten-day event, poetry, music, and dance were utilized to examine human consciousness.  The conference has been held annually through 2015 in Nobleboro Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenwald|first1=John|title=John Rosenwald collection of Robert Bly Great Mother Conference materials, 1975-1978, 1980-1984, 1986-1987, 1990-1995, 2001-2002, 2004-2009|url=http://special.lib.umn.edu/findaid/xml/mss081D.xml#a23|website=University of Minnesota Literary Manuscripts Collections, Manuscripts Division|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the beginning one of its major themes was the goddess or "[[Gender of God|Great Mother]]" as she has been known throughout human history. Much of Bly's 1973 book of poems "Sleepers Joining Hands" is concerned with this theme. In the context of the Vietnam War, a focus on the divine feminine was seen as urgent and necessary.  Since that time, the Conference has expanded to consider a wide variety of poetic, mythological, and fairy tale traditions. In the '80s and '90s there was much discussion among the conference community about the changes contemporary men were (and are) going through; "the New Father" was then added to the Conference title, in recognition of this and in order to keep the Conference as inclusive as possible. Bly no longer attends, but the conference continues with new teachers each year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://greatmotherconference.org/ The Great Mother and New Father Conference]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps his most famous work is ''[[Iron John: A Book About Men]]'' (1990), an international bestseller which has been translated into many languages and is credited with starting the [[Mythopoetic men's movement]] in the United States. Bly frequently conducts workshops for men with [[James Hillman]], [[Michael J. Meade]], and others, as well as workshops for men and women with [[Marion Woodman]]. He maintains a friendly correspondence with [[Clarissa Pinkola Estés]], author of ''Women Who Run With the Wolves''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Bly wrote ''The Maiden King:  The Reunion of Masculine and Feminine'' with Marion Woodman.

Bly was the [[University of Minnesota]] Library's 2002 Distinguished Writer. He received the [[McKnight Foundation]]'s Distinguished Artist Award in 2000, and the [[Maurice English Poetry Award]] in 2002. He has published more than 40 collections of poetry, edited many others, and published translations of poetry and prose from such languages as [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]], [[Norwegian (language)|Norwegian]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]]. His book ''The Night Abraham Called to the Stars'' was nominated for a [[Minnesota Book Award]]. He also edited the prestigious ''Best American Poetry 1999'' (Scribners).

In 2006 the [[University of Minnesota]] purchased Bly's archive, which contained more than 80,000 pages of handwritten manuscripts; a journal spanning nearly 50 years; notebooks of his "morning poems"; drafts of translations; hundreds of audio and videotapes, and correspondence with many writers such as [[James Wright (poet)|James Wright]], [[Donald Hall]] and [[James Dickey]]. The archive is housed at Elmer L. Andersen Library on the [[University of Minnesota]] campus. The university paid $775,000 from school funds and private donors.

In February 2008, Bly was named Minnesota's first [[poet laureate]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/01/arts/01arts-APOETLAUREAT_BRF.html?ref=arts|title=A Poet Laureate for Minnesota|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=March 1, 2008 |accessdate=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year he also contributed a poem and an Afterword to ''From the Other World: Poems in Memory of James Wright''. In February 2013, he was awarded the [[Robert Frost Medal]], a lifetime achievement recognition given by the [[Poetry Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhpbooks.com/robert-blys-distinguished-lifetime-achievement/ |title=Robert Bly's "distinguished lifetime achievement" |work=[[Melville House Publishing]] |author=Aly Vander Hayden |date=February 14, 2013 |accessdate=February 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought and the Men's Movement==
Much of Bly's prose writing focuses on what he saw as the particularly troubled situation in which many males find themselves today. He understood this to be a result of, among other things, the decline of traditional fathering which left young boys unguided through the stages of life leading to maturity. He claimed that in contrast with women who are better informed by their bodies (notably by the beginning and end of their [[menstrual cycle]]), men need to be actively guided out of boyhood and into manhood by their elders. Pre-modern cultures had elaborate myths, often enacted as [[rites of passage]], as well as "men's societies" where older men would teach young boys about these gender-specific issues. As modern fathers have become increasingly absent, this knowledge is no longer being passed down the generations, resulting in what he referred to as a Sibling Society.&lt;ref&gt;Bly, Robert (1990), ''Iron John: A Book About Men'', Da Capo Press, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Absence of the Father" is a recurrent theme in Bly's work and many of the phenomena of depression, juvenile delinquency and lack of leadership in business and politics are linked to it.

Bly therefore sees today's men as half-adults, trapped between boyhood and maturity, in a state where they find it hard to become responsible in their work as well as leaders in their communities. Eventually they might become weak or absent fathers themselves which will lead this behaviour to be passed down to their children. In his book ''[[The Sibling Society]]'' (1997), Bly argues that a society formed of such men is inherently problematic as it lacks creativity and a deep sense of empathy. The image of half-adults is further reinforced by popular culture which often portrays fathers as naive, overweight and almost always emotionally co-dependent. Historically this represents a recent shift from a traditional patriarchal model and Bly believes that women rushed to fill the gap that was formed through the various [[Counterculture of the 1960s|youth movements during the 1960s]],&lt;ref&gt;''Iron John'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; enhancing men's emotional capacities and helping them to connect with women's age-old pain of repression. It has however also led to the creation of "soft males" who lacked the outwardly directed strength to revitalize the community with assertiveness and a certain warrior strength.

In Bly's view, a potential solution lies in the rediscovery of the meanings hidden in traditional myths and fairytales as well as works of poetry. He researched and collected myths that concern male maturity, often originating from the ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' and published them in various books, ''Iron John'' being the best known example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newdimensions.org/search.php?q=robert+bly&amp;Submit=Search New Dimensions Media]. Retrieved January 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the continual pursuit of higher achievements, that is constantly taught to young men today, the theme of [[Katabasis#Trip into the underworld|spiritual descent]] (often being referred to by its Greek term ''κατάβασις'') which is to be found in many of these myths, is presented as a necessary step for coming in contact with the deeper aspects of the masculine self and achieving its full potential. This is often presented as hero, often during the middle of his quest, going underground to pass a period of solitude and sorrow in semi-bestial mode. Bly notices that a cultural space existed in most traditional societies for such a period in a man's life, in the absence of which, many men today go into a depression and alcoholism as they subconsciously try to emulate this innate ritual.

Bly was influenced by the Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] who developed the theory of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], the discrete structures of the [[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]] which emerge as images in both art and myths. The Powerful King, the Evil Witch and the Beautiful Maiden are, according to Jung, imprints of the [[collective unconscious]] and Bly wrote extensively about their meaning and relations to modern life. As an example and in accordance with Jung, he considered the Witch to be that part of the male psyche upon which the negative and destructive side of a woman is imprinted and which first developed during infancy to store the imperfections of one's own mother. As a consequence, the Witch's symbols are essentially inverted motherly symbols, where the loving act of cooking is transformed into the brewing of evil potions and knitting clothes takes the form of spider's web. The feeding process is also reversed, with the child now in danger of being eaten to feed the body of the Witch rather than being fed by the mother's own body. In that respect, the Witch is a mark of [[developmental disorder|arrested development]] on the part of the man as it guards against feminine realities that his psyche is not yet able to incorporate fully. Fairy tales according to this interpretation mostly describe internal battles played out externally, where the hero saves his future bride by killing a witch, as in "The Drummer" ([[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Grimms tale 193]]). This particular concept is expanded in Bly's 1989 talk "The Human Shadow" and the book it presented.&lt;ref&gt;Bly, Robert (1989). ''The Human Shadow'' [audiobook].

In July 2016 there were reports of papers being removed from SSRN without notice; revision comments from SSRN indicated this was due to copyright concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160718/02211935003/just-as-open-competitor-to-elseviers-ssrn-launches-ssrn-accused-copyright-crackdown.shtml|title=Just As Open Competitor To Elsevier's SSRN Launches, SSRN Accused Of Copyright Crackdown|website=Techdirt|last1=Masnick|first1=Mike|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSRN CEO Gregg Gordon characterized the issue as a mistake affecting about 20 papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/07/19/social-science-research-network-confusion-leads-calls-boycott|title='There Isn't Some Big Conspiracy Happening'|website=Inside Higher Ed|last1=Straumsheim|first1=Carl|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2017, SSRN has been adding new disciplines in areas such as biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, computer science and more. 

== Operations ==
Academic papers in PDF format can be uploaded directly to the SSRN site by authors and are then available around the world via download. Users can also subscribe to abstracting emails covering a broad range of research areas and topic specialties. These distributing emails contain abstracts (with links to the full text where applicable) of papers recently submitted to SSRN in the respective field.

SSRN, like other preprint services, circulates publications throughout the scholarly community at an early stage, permitting the author to incorporate comments into the final version of the paper before its publication in a journal. Moreover, even if access to the published paper is restricted, access to the original working paper remains open through SSRN, so long as the author decides to keep the paper up.  Often authors take papers down at the request of publishers, particularly if they are published by commercial or university presses that depend on payment for paper copies or online access.

Academic papers in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format can be uploaded directly to the SSRN site by authors and are then available for worldwide free downloading. Publishers and institutions can upload papers and charge a fee for readers to download them.&lt;ref name="About_SSRN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssrn.com/update/general/mjensen.html |title=About SSRN |first=Michael C. |last=Jensen |authorlink=Michael C. Jensen |date=2 February 2012 |work=Social Science Research Network |publisher=Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc. |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can also subscribe to abstracting [[email]] journals covering a broad range of subject matters. These e-journals then periodically distribute emails containing abstracts (with links to the full text where applicable) of papers recently submitted to SSRN in the respective field.

On SSRN, authors and papers are ranked by their number of downloads, which has become an informal indicator of popularity on prepress and [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bernard S.

==Career==

Bell worked for [[ABC News]] from 1967 to 1986.

He left the position in 1986 and moved to [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], to co-anchor evening newscasts for [[KYW-TV]]. While there, he also anchored short-form news updates for the [[USA Network]], alongside his colleagues at KYW, titled ''USA Updates''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB29C26E59395BA&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Hail and Farewell from 'GMA' to Bell|last=Kolson|first=Ann|date=1986-12-30|accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell appeared on [[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]] in 2005 to present a report on how [[China]] has changed since Mao's rule; he and Koppel had earlier filmed a [[Documentary film|documentary]] there during the [[Mao Zedong]] era.

A '''student''' is primarily a person enrolled in a [[school]] or other [[educational institution]] who attends classes in a course to attain the appropriate level of mastery of a subject under the guidance of an instructor and who devotes time outside class to do whatever activities the instructor assigns that are necessary either for class preparation or to submit evidence of progress towards that mastery.  In the broader sense, a student is anyone who applies themselves to the intensive intellectual engagement with some matter necessary to master it as part of some practical affair in which such mastery is basic or decisive.  

In the [[United Kingdom]] and India, the term "student" denotes those enrolled in secondary schools and higher (e.g., college or [[university]]); those enrolled in elementary schools are called "pupils."

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria, education is classified into four system known as a 6-3-3-4 system of education. It implies six years in primary school, three years in junior secondary, three years in senior secondary and four years in the university. However, the number of years to be spent in university is mostly determined by the course of study. Some courses have longer study length than others. Those in primary school are often referred to as pupils. Those in university, as well as those in secondary school, are being referred to as students.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The Nigerian system of education also has other recognized categories like the polytechnics and colleges of education. The Polytechnic gives out National Diploma and Higher National Diploma certifications after a period of two years and/or four years of study respectively.

Higher National Diploma (also known as HND) can be obtained in a different institution from where the National Diploma (also known as ND or OND) was obtained. However, the HND cannot be obtained without the OND certificate.

On the other hand, colleges of education give out NCE (Nigerian Certificate in Education) after a two year period of study.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, education is divided into four bands: Foundation Phase (grades 1–3), Intermediate Phase (grades 4–6), Senior Phase (grades 7–9), and the Further Education and Training or FET Phase (grades 10–12). However, because this division is newer than most schools in the country, in practice, learners progress through three different types of school: primary school (grades 1–3), junior school (grades 4–7), and high school (grades 8–12). After the FET phase, learners who pursue further studies typically take three or four years to obtain an undergraduate degree or one or two years to achieve a vocational diploma or certificate. The number of years spent in university varies as different courses of study take different numbers of years. Those in the last year of high school (Grade 12) are referred to as 'Matrics' or are in 'Matric' and take the Grade 12 examinations accredited by the Umalusi Council (the South African board of education) in October and November of their Matric year. Exam papers are set and administered nationally through the National Department of Basic Education for government schools, while many (but not all) private school Matrics sit for exams set by the Independent Education Board (IEB), which operates with semi-autonomy under the requirements of Umalusi. (The assessment and learning requirements of both IEB and National exams are of roughly the same standard. The perceived better performance of learners within the IEB exams is largely attributable to their attending private, better-resourced schools with the much lower teacher: learner ratios and class sizes rather than because of fundamental differences in assessment or learning content). A school year for the majority of schools in South Africa runs from January to December, with holidays dividing the year into terms. Most public or government schools are 4-term schools and most private schools are 3-term school, but the 3-term government or public schools and 4-term private schools are not rare.

==Asia==

===Singapore===
Six years of primary school education in Singapore is compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/primary Moe.gov.sg]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Primary School (Primary 1 to 6)
* Secondary School ( Secondary 1 to 4 or 5)
* Junior College (Junior College 1 to 2 - Optional)

There are also schools which have the [[Integrated Programme|integrated program]], such as [[River Valley High School (Singapore)]], which means they stay in the same school from Secondary 1 to Junior College 2, without having to take the "O" level examinations which most students take at the end of Secondary school.

International Schools are subject to overseas curriculums, such as the British, American, Canadian or Australian Boards.

===Bangladesh===

Primary education is compulsory in Bangladesh. It is a near crime to not to send children to primary school when they are of age. But it is not a punishable crime (sending children to work instead of school is a crime). Because of the socio-economic state of Bangladesh, child labour is sometimes legal. But the guardian must ensure the primary education. Everyone who is learning in any institute or even online may be called a student in Bangladesh. Sometimes students taking undergraduate education are called undergraduates and students taking post-graduate education may be called post-graduates.

===Brunei===
Education is free in Brunei. Darussalam not limited to government educational institutions but also private educational institutions. There are mainly two types of educational institutions: government or public, and private institutions.  Several stages have to be undergone by the prospective students leading to higher qualifications, such as [[Bachelor's Degree]].

* Primary School (Year 1 to 6)
* Secondary School (Year 7 to 11)
* High School [or also known as the Sixth Form Centers] (Year 12 to 13)
* Colleges (Pre-University to Diploma)
* University Level (Undergraduate, Postgraduate and Professional)

It takes six and five years to complete the primary and secondary levels respectively. Upon completing these two crucial stages, students/pupils have freedom to progress to sixth-form centers, colleges or probably straight to employment.  Students are permitted to progress towards university level programs in both government and private university colleges.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Cambodia===
Education in [[Cambodia]] is free for all the students who study in Primary School, Secondary School or High School.
* Primary School (Grade 1 to 6)
* Secondary School (Grade 7 to 9)
* High School (Grade 10 to 12)
* College (Year 1 to 3)
* University (Year 1 to 4 or 5)
After basic education, students can opt to take a bachelor's (undergraduate) degree at a higher education institution (i.e. a college or university), which normally lasts for four years though the length of some courses may be longer or shorter depending on the institution.

===India===
[[File:Indian schoolgirls.jpg|thumb|Girls in [[school uniform]] in Delhi, India]]

In [[India]] school is categorized in these stages: Pre-primary (Nursery, Lower Kindergarten or LKG, Upper Kindergarten or UKG), Primary (Class 1-5), Secondary (6-10) and Higher Secondary (11-12). For undergraduate it is 3 years except Engineering (BTech or BE) which is of 4 years degree course, Architecture (B.Arch) which is 5 years degree course and Medical (MBBS) which is of 4.5 years degree course and 1 year Internship, so 5.5 years.

===Nepal===
[[File:Student-khiji-1985.png|thumb|Girls reading book in school 1985 [[Khiji]], [[Nepal]]]]
In [[Nepal]] 12-year school is categorized in three stages: Primary school, Secondary school and Higher Secondary school. For college it averages four years for a bachelor's degree (except BVSc and AH which is five years programme and MBBS which is a five and half years programme) and two years master's degree.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, 12-year school is categorized in three stages: Primary school, Secondary school and Higher Secondary school. It takes five years for a student to graduate from Primary school, five years for Secondary school and five years for Higher Secondary school (also called College). Most bachelor's degrees span over four years, followed by a two years master's degree.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Philippines===
The Philippines is currently in the midst of a transition to a K-12 (also called K+12) basic education system.&lt;ref name="GovPH"&gt;[http://www.gov.ph/downloads/2012/201209-K-to-12-Toolkit.pdf K to 12 Toolkit] Accessed 21 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DepEdPH"&gt;[http://www.deped.gov.ph/k-to-12/curriculum-guides K to 12 Curriculum Guides] Accessed 21 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SenatePH"&gt;[https://www.senate.gov.ph/republic_acts/ra%2010533.pdf Republic Act 10533] Accessed 21 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Education ideally begins with one year of kinder.  Once the transition is complete, elementary or grade school comprises grades 1 to 6.  Although the term ''student'' may refer to learners of any age or level, the term 'pupil' is used by the Department of Education to refer to learners in the elementary level, particularly in public schools.  Secondary level or high school comprises two major divisions: grades 7 to 10 will be collectively referred to as 'junior high school', whereas grades 11 to 12 will be collectively referred to as 'senior high school'.  The Department of Education refers to learners in grade 7 and above as ''students''.

After basic education, students can opt to take a bachelor's (undergraduate) degree at a higher education institution (i.e. a college or university), which normally lasts for four years though the length of some courses may be longer or shorter depending on the institution.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Iran===

In Iran 12-year school is categorized in two stages: Elementary school and High school. It takes six years for a student to graduate from elementary school and six years for high school. High school study is divided into two part: junior and senior high school. In senior high school, student can choose between the following six fields: Mathematics and physics, Science, Humanities, Islamic science, Vocational, or Work and knowledge. After graduating from high school, students acquire a diploma. Having a diploma, a student can participate in the [[Iranian University Entrance Exam]] or Konkoor in different fields of Mathematics, Science, Humanities, languages, and art. The university entrance exam is conducted every year by National Organization of Education Assessment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanjesh.org/ Sanjesh.org]&lt;/ref&gt; an organization under the supervision of the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology which is in charge of universities in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msrt.ir|title=وزارت علوم، تحقیقات و فناوری - صفحات - صفحه اصلی|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Bahá'í]] religion, a much-persecuted minority, are officially forbidden to attend university, in order to prevent members of the faith becoming doctors, lawyers or other professionals; however, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian people are allowed entry to universities.

===Australia===
[[File:StateLibQld 1 78509 Students of Stony Creek State School Woodford, Queensland, 1939.jpg|thumb|Students of Stony Creek State School, [[Queensland]], 1939]]

In [[Australia]], Pre-school is optional for three and four year olds.  At age five, children begin compulsory education at Primary School, known as Kindergarten in [[New South Wales]], Preparatory School (prep) in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and Reception in [[South Australia]], students then continue to year one through six (ages 6 to 12).  Before 2014, primary school continued on to year seven in [[Western Australia]], South Australia and [[Queensland]].  However, the state governments agreed that by 2014, all primary schooling will complete at year six.  Students attend High School in year seven through twelve (ages 13 – 18).  After year twelve, students may attend tertiary education at University or vocational training at TAFE ([[technical and further education|Technical and Further Education]]).

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], after kindergarten or pre-school, which is attended from ages three to five, children begin primary school, 'Year One', at five years of age. Years One to Six are Primary School, where children commonly attend local schools in the area for that specific year group. Then Year Seven and Year Eight are Intermediate, and from Year Nine until Year Thirteen, a student would attend a secondary school or a college.

==Europe==
Europe uses the traditional, first form, second form, third form, fourth form, fifth form and six form grade system which is up to age eleven.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Finland===
[[File:Mathematics lecture at the Helsinki University of Technology.jpg|thumb|Students in a [[lecture]] on [[linear algebra]] at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]]]
In Finland a student is called "opiskelija" (plural being 'opiskelijat'), though children in compulsory education are called "oppilas" (plural being 'oppilaat'). First level of education is "esikoulu" (literally 'preschool'), which used to be optional, but has been compulsory since the beginning of year 2015. Children attend esikoulu the year they turn six, and next year they start attending "peruskoulu" (literally "basic school", corresponds to American elementary school, middle school and junior high), which is compulsory. Peruskoulu is divided to "alakoulu" (years 1 through 6) and "yläkoulu" (years 7 through 9). After compulsory education most children attend second level education (toisen asteen koulutus), either lukio (corresponds to high school) or ammattikoulu (Vocational School), at which point they are called students (opiskelija). Some attend "kymppiluokka", which is a retake on some yläkoulu's education.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

To attend ammattikorkeakoulu (University of applied sciences) or a university a student must have a second level education. The recommended graduation time is five years. First year students are called "fuksi" and students that have studied more than five years are called "N:nnen vuoden opiskelija" (Nth year student).

===France===
The generic term "''étudiant''" (lit. student) applies only to someone attending a University or a school of a similar level, that is to say pupils in a cursus reserved to people already owning a [[Baccalauréat]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  The general term for a person going to primary or secondary school is ''élève''. In some French higher education establishments, a ''bleu'' or "bizuth" is a first-year student. Second-year students are sometimes called "carrés" (squares). Some other terms may apply in specific schools, some depending on the [[classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles]] attended.

===Germany===
In Germany, the German cognate term ''Student'' (male) or "Studentin" (female) is reserved for those attending a university. University students in their first year are called ''Erstsemester'' or colloquially ''Ersties'' ("firsties"). Different terms for school students exist, depending on which kind of school is attended by the student. The general term for a person going to school is ''Schüler'' or ''Schülerin''. They begin their first four years in primary school or ''Volksschule''. They then graduate to a secondary school called ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'', which is a university preparatory school. Students attending this school are called ''Gymnasiasten'', while those attending other schools are called ''Hauptschüler'' or ''Realschüler''. Students who graduate with the [[Abitur]] are called ''Abiturienten''.
The abbreviation stud. + the abbreviation of the faculty p. e. phil. for ''philosophiae'' is a post-nominal for all students of a baccalaureus course. The abbreviation cand. for ''candidatus'' + the abbreviation of the faculty is given as a post-nominal to those close to the final exams. ''First name surname'', stud. phil. or ''First name surname'', cand. jur.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Ireland===
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], pupils officially start with primary school which consists of eight years: junior infants, senior infants, first class to sixth class (ages 5–11). After primary school, pupils proceed to the secondary school level. Here they first enter the junior cycle, which consists of first year to third year (ages 11–14). At the end of third year, all students must sit a compulsory state examination called the [[Junior Certificate]]. After third year, pupils have the option of taking a "transition year" or fourth year (usually at age 15-16). In transition year pupils take a break from regular studies to pursue other activities that help to promote their personal, social, vocational and educational development, and to prepares them for their role as autonomous, participative and responsible members of society. It also provides a bridge to enable pupils to make the transition from the more dependent type of learning associated with the Junior Cert. to the more independent learning environment associated with the senior cycle.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

After the junior cycle pupils advance to the senior cycle, which consists of fifth year and sixth year (usually ages between 16 and 18). At the end of the sixth year a final state examination is required to be sat by all pupils, known as the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]]. The Leaving Cert. is the basis for all Irish pupils who wish to do so to advance to higher education via a points system. A maximum of 625 points can be achieved. All higher education courses have a minimum of points needed for admission.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

At [[Trinity College, Dublin]] under-graduate students are formally called "junior freshmen", "senior freshmen", "junior sophister" or "senior sophister", according to the year they have reached in the typical four year degree course. ''Sophister'' is another term for a [[Sophomore year|sophomore]], though the term is rarely used in other institutions and is largely limited to Trinity College Dublin.

At university, the term "fresher" is used to describe new students who are just beginning their first year. The term, "first year" is the more commonly used and connotation-free term for students in their first year. The week at the start of a new year is called "[[Orientation week|Freshers' Week]]" or "Welcome Week", with a programme of special events to welcome new students. An undergraduate in the last year of study before graduation is generally known as a "finalist."

===Italy===
[[File:Universität Bologna Deutsche Nation.jpg|thumb|Admission of a student in "Germanic Nation", [[University of Bologna]], 15th century]]
In Italian, a ''matricola'' is a first-year student. Some other terms may apply in specific schools, some depending on the [[liceo classico]] or [[liceo scientifico]] attended.

According to the [[Goliardia|goliardic]] initiation traditions the grades granted (following approximately the year of enrollment at university) are: ''matricola'' (freshman), ''fagiolo'' (sophomore), ''colonna'' (junior), and ''anziano'' (senior), but most of the distinctions are rarely used outside Goliardia.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, only those studying at university level are called students (''student'', plural ''studenter''). To graduate from upper secondary school (''gymnasium'') is called ''ta studenten'' (literally "to take the student"), but after the graduation festivities, the graduate is no longer a student unless he or she enrolls at university-level education. At lower levels, the word ''elev'' (plural ''elever'') is used. As a general term for all stages of education, the word ''studerande'' (plural also ''studerande'') is used, meaning 'studying [person]'.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Europa-Institut graduation.jpg|thumb|The new graduates of the [[Europa-Institut]] in Germany gather to throw their mortar boards in the air as part of a graduation ceremony]]
Traditionally, the term "student" is reserved for people studying at university level in the [[United Kingdom]].

At universities in the UK, the term "fresher" is used informally to describe new students who are just beginning their first year. Although it is not unusual to call someone a fresher after their first few weeks at university, they are typically referred to as "first years" or "first year students".

The ancient Scottish [[University of St Andrews]] uses the terms "bejant" for a first year (from the French "''bec-jaune''"&amp;nbsp;– "yellow beak", "fledgling"). Second years are called "semi-bejants", third years are known as "tertians", and fourth years, or others in their final year of study, are called "magistrands".

In [[England and Wales]], primary school begins with an optional "nursery" year followed by reception and then move on to "year one, year two" and so on until "year six". In state schools, children join secondary school when they are 11–12 years old in what used to be called "first form" and is now known as "year 7". They go up to year 11 (formerly "fifth form") and then join the sixth form, either at the same school or at a separate [[sixth form college]]. A pupil entering a private, fee-paying school (usually at age 13) would join the "third form" — equivalent to year 9. Many schools have an alternate name for first years, some with a derogatory basis, but in others acting merely as a description — for example "shells" (non-derogatory) or "grubs" (derogatory).

In [[Northern Ireland]] and Scotland, it is very similar but with some differences. Pupils start off in nursery or reception aged 3 to 4, and then start primary school in "P1" (P standing for primary) or year 1. They then continue primary school until "P7" or year 7. After that they start secondary school at 11 years old, this is called "1st year" or year 8 in Northern Ireland, or "S1" in Scotland. They continue secondary school until the age of 16 at "5th year", year 12 or "S5", and then it is the choice of the individual pupil to decide to continue in school and (in Northern Ireland) do AS levels (known as "lower sixth") and then the next year to do A levels (known as "upper sixth"). In Scotland, students aged 16–18 take Highers, followed by Advanced Highers. Alternatively, pupils can leave and go into full-time employment or to start in a technical college.

Large increases in the size of student populations in the UK and the effect this has had on some university towns or on areas of cities located near universities have become a concern in the UK since 2000. A report by Universities UK, "''Studentification: A Guide to Opportunities, Challenges and Practice''" (2006) has explored the subject and made various recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Publications/Documents/studentification_guide.pdf Studentification: A Guide to Opportunities, Challenges and Practice]&lt;/ref&gt; A particular problem in many locations is seen as the impact of students on the availability, quality and price of rented and owner-occupied property.

==Americas==

===Canada===
{{details|Education in Canada}}
[[File:Work in the computer lab.JPG|thumb|Students of the ''Cégep de St-Hyacinthe'' in Quebec working in a computer lab]]
Education in Canada is within the constitutional jurisdiction of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]], and the overall curriculum is overseen by the provincial governments. As there is no overall national coordinating authority, the way the educational stages are grouped and named differs from region to region. Education is generally divided into primary education, followed by secondary education, and post-secondary education. Primary and secondary education are generally divided into numbered grades from 1 to 12, although the first grade may be preceded by [[kindergarten]] (optional in many provinces). Ontario and Quebec offer a [[pre-kindergarten]], called a "junior kindergarten" in Ontario, and a "garderie" in Quebec.

[[Education in Ontario]] once involved an [[Ontario Academic Credit]] (OAC) as university preparation, but that was phased out in 2007, and now all provinces except Quebec have 12 grades. The OAC was informally known as "grade 13" and the name was also used to refer to the students who took it.

[[Education in Quebec]] differs from the other provinces in that it has an école primaire (literally "primary school") consisting of grades 1-6, and an école secondaire (literally "secondary school") consisting of secondaries I-V. Secondaries I-V are equivalent to grades 7-11. A student graduating from high school (grade 11) can then either complete a three-year [[College education in Quebec|college]] program or attend a two-year pre-university program required before attending university. In some English High Schools, as well as in most French schools, high school students will refer to secondary 1-5 as year one through five. So if someone in Secondary three is asked "what grade/year are you in?" they will reply "three" or "sec 3". It is presumed that the person asking the question knows that they are not referring to "Grade 3" but rather "Secondary 3". This can be confusing for those outside of Quebec.

In some provinces, grades 1 through 6 are called "elementary school", grades 6 to 8 are called "middle school" or "junior high school", and grades 9 to 12 are considered high school. Other provinces, such as British Columbia, mainly divide schooling into elementary school (Kindergarten to grade 7) and secondary school (grades 8 through 12). In Alberta and Nova Scotia, elementary consists of kindergarten through grade 6. Junior high consists of Grades 7-9. High school consists of Grades 10-12. In English provinces, the high school (known as ''academy'' or ''secondary school'') years can be referred to simply as ''first, second, third and fourth year''. Some areas call it by grade such as grade 10, grade 11 and grade 12.

The difference between college and university is significantly different from in the United States or even the United Kingdom. A Canadian [[college]] is more similar to an American community college but also the British, French and other European and British Commonwealth such as Australian and New Zealand etc., on the other hand. In contrast, a Canadian university is also quite comparable to an American university as well as many other universities among the [[English-speaking world]] and [[Francosphere]]. In Canada, colleges are generally geared for individuals seeking applied careers, while universities are geared for individuals seeking more academic careers.

University students are generally classified as first, second, third or fourth-year students, and the American system of classifying them as "freshmen", "sophomores", "juniors" and "seniors" is seldom used or even understood in Canada. In some occasions, they can be called "senior ones", "twos", "threes" and "fours".

===United States===
In the United States, the first official year of schooling is called [[kindergarten]], which is why the students are called kindergarteners. Kindergarten is optional in most states, but few students skip this level. Pre-kindergarten, also known as "[[preschool]]" (and sometimes shortened to "Pre-K") is becoming a standard of education as academic expectations for the youngest students continue to rise. Many public schools offer pre-kindergarten programs.

}}

In the United States there are 12 years of mandatory schooling. The first eight are solely referred to by numbers (e.g. 1st grade, 5th grade) so students may be referred to as 1st graders, 5th graders, then once in middle school before high school you are ratio referred to as 6th, 7th, 8th graders. Upon entering high school, grades 9 through 12 ([[High school (North America)|high school]]) also have alternate names for students, namely freshman, sophomore, junior and senior. The actual divisions of which grade levels belong to which division (whether elementary, middle, junior high or high school) is a matter decided by state or local jurisdictions.

Accordingly, college students are often called Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors (respectively), unless their undergraduate program calls for more than the traditional 4 years.

====First year====
The first year of college or high school is referred to as Freshman year. A [[freshman]] (slang alternatives that are usually derogatory in nature include "fish", "new-g", "fresher", "frosh", "newbie", "freshie", "snotter", "fresh-meat", "skippie", etc.) is a first-year student in [[college]], [[university]] or [[High school (North America)|high school]].

====Second year==== 
In the U.S., a [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]], also called a "soph," is a second-year student. Outside the United States, the term Sophomore is rarely used, with second-year students simply called "second years". [[Folk etymology]] indicates that the word means "[[wise fool]]"; consequently "sophomoric" means "pretentious, bombastic, inflated in style or manner; immature, crude, superficial" (according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''). It is widely assumed to be formed from Greek "''sophos''", meaning "wise", and "''moros''" meaning "foolish", although the etymology suggests an origin from the now-defunct "sophumer", an obsolete variant of "[[sophism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sophomore&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-second year====
[[File:Teamsolvingpuzzle.jpg|thumb|upright|Students from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]]]
In the U.S., a Junior is a student in the penultimate (usually third) year and a Senior is a student in the last (usually fourth) year of [[college]], [[university]], or [[High school (North America)|high school]].  A student who takes more than the normal number of years to graduate is sometimes referred to as a "[[super senior]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/super_senior/ Definition of a super senior] retrieved 5 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  This term is often used in college, but can be used in high school as well. The term underclassman is used to refer collectively to Freshmen and Sophomores, and Upperclassman to refer collectively to Juniors and Seniors, sometimes even Sophomores. The term Middler is used to describe a third-year student of a school (generally [[college]]) that offers five years of study.  In this situation, the fourth and fifth years would be referred to as Junior and Senior years, respectively, and the first two years would be the Freshman and Sophomore years.

====Graduate Students====
A graduate student is a student who continues his/her education after graduation. Some examples of graduate programs are: [[business school]], [[law school]], [[medical school]], and [[veterinary school]]. Degrees earned in graduate programs include the [[Master’s degree]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy|research doctoral]] degree, or a [[first professional degree]].

====Vocational School====
Students attending [[vocational school]] focus on their jobs and learning how to work in specific fields of work. A vocational program typically takes much less time to complete than a four-year degree program, lasting 12–24 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwm.org/rwm/tf_min.html|title=Minnesota Vocational Schools, Trade Schools, Technical Schools - RWM.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal Arts that are required in four-year Universities are less important to these students because the skills necessary for their careers take precedence in order for a timely completion of the program.

==Student politics==
{{Students rights sidebar}}
{{Main article|Student politics}}
Students have their own current of politics and activism on and off campus. The [[Student rights in higher education|student rights]] movement has centered itself on the empowerment of students similar to the labor movement.

==Mature students==
{{Main article|Adult learner}}

A mature, non-traditional, or adult student in [[tertiary education]] (at a university or a college) is normally classified as an (undergraduate) student who is at least 21–23 years old at the start of their [[Course of study|course]] and usually having been out of the education system for at least two years. Mature students can also include students who have been out of the education system for decades, or students with no secondary education. Mature students also make up graduate and [[postgraduate]] populations by demographic of age.

University students have been associated with pranks and japes since the creation of universities in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/pranks.shtml |title=Seeley G.

It is also not uncommon for students from one school to steal or deface the [[mascot]] of a rival school.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Eli, [http://archive.dailycal.org/article.php?id=10351 "Oski and Tree Have Rowdy, Long History"], ''The Daily Californian'', 22 November 2002. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040920041614/http://www.dailycal.org/article.php?id=10351 |date=September 20, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, pranks play such a significant part in student culture that numerous books have been published that focus on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, T.F., ''Nightwork: A History of Hacks and Pranks at MIT'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Neil, ''If at All Possible, Involve a Cow: The Book''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terms==
*Students who are [[Grade retention|repeating a grade level of schooling due to poor grades]] are sometimes referred to as having been "held back" or "kept back". In Singapore they are described as "retained". In the Philippines they are called "repeater".
*The term 'pupil' (originally a Latin term for a minor as the ward of an adult guardian, etc.) is used in some Commonwealth [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school|secondary]] schools (particularly in England and Wales) instead of "student", but once attending further education (at a [[sixth-form]] college) or higher education (at [[university]] for example), the term "student" is standard.  The term ''pupil'' is also used in the Philippines by the Department of Education to refer to learners currently in elementary school; the term ''student'' is used for by the Department of Education for learners in high school.
*The [[United States military academies]] officially use only numerical terms, but there are colloquial expressions used in everyday speech. In order from first year to fourth year, students are referred to as "fourth-class", "third-class", "second-class", and "first-class" cadets or midshipmen. Unofficially, other terms are used, for example at the United States Military Academy, freshmen are called "plebes", sophomores are called "yearlings" or "yuks", juniors are called "cows", and seniors are called "firsties".  Some universities also use numerical terms to identify classes; students enter as "first-years" and graduate as "fourth-years" (or, in some cases, "fifth-years", "sixth-years", etc.).

==Idiomatic use==
"[[Freshman]]" and "[[Sophomore year|sophomore]]" are sometimes used [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]]ly, almost exclusively in the United States, to refer to a first or second effort ("the singer's ''sophomore'' [[album]]"), or to a [[politician]]'s first or second term in office ("freshman senator") or an [[sportsperson|athlete]]'s first or second year on a [[professional sports team]]. "Junior" and "senior" are not used in this figurative way to refer to third and fourth years or efforts, because of those words' broader meanings of "[[wikt:younger|younger]]" and "[[wikt:older|older]]." A [[junior senator]] is therefore not one who is in a third term of office, but merely one who has not been in the Senate as long as the other senator from their [[U.S. state|state]]. Confusingly, this means that it is possible to be both a "freshman Senator" and a "senior Senator" simultaneously: for example, if a Senator wins election in 2008, and then the other Senator from the same state steps down and a new Senator elected in 2010, the former Senator is both senior Senator (as in the Senate for two years more) and a freshman Senator (since still in the first term).

==International Students' Day==
[[International Students' Day]] (17 November) remembers the anniversary of the 1939 Nazi storming of the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]] after student demonstrations against the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]]. Germans closed all Czech universities and colleges, sent over 1200 students to Nazi concentration camps, and had nine student leaders executed (on November 17).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/the-17th-of-november-remembering-jan-opletal-martyr-of-an-occupied-nation The 17th of November: Remembering Jan Opletal, martyr of an occupied nation]".

'''Tirumalai Krishnamacharya Venkata Desikachar''' (21 June 1938 – 8 August 2016), better known as '''T. K. V. Desikachar''', was a modern-day yoga teacher, whose father was the Indian yoga teacher, Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. In the West, there are several significant contemporary approaches to Hatha-Yoga, which are based on traditional teachings to varying degrees and which also utilize Yoga’s therapeutic potential. The most traditional orientation,{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} which goes by the modern generic name of the [[Viniyoga]] (application) of Yoga, is found in the school of [[Tirumalai Krishnamacharya]] (1888-1989) and his son T. K. V. Desikachar.

==Early years==
Desikachar was born in Mysore and moved to [[Madras]] (now Chennai) in the early 1960s. He had trained as an [[engineer]], but, inspired by his father's teachings, he abandoned his engineering career and became a student of his father in 1960 even though it was at a time when the practice of yoga didn't have the respect it enjoys today. From the 1970s onwards he taught extensively in many parts of the world and published many books which became best sellers, with the result that his name and teachings became known worldwide. 

==Education in Yoga==
Desikachar is known for his incomparable ability to demystify yoga teachings and also for his pioneering work in the area of wellness and yoga therapy. During his intensive thirty years of study with his teacher, he learned the practice and application of all the tools of Yoga, including chanting, so as to be able to help people therapeutically, live their everyday life better and more productively, and evolve spiritually. He also studied in depth many literary works including the Vishnu Sahsranama, Bhagavad Gita, Visnu Purana, hymns of the great Vaisnavite saint Vedanta Desika, the Yoga Rahasya of Nathamuni, Patanjali's Yogasutra, Yajnavalkya Samhita, Yoga Taravalli, HathayogaPradipika. This long period of study is why Desikachar’s teaching so closely represents the complete tradition of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/Poses-and-postures/article14558639.ece |title=Poses and postures|publisher=The Hindu News |date=2010 |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kym.org/about-kym/  |title=Pioneering work in the area of wellness through Yoga |publisher=KYM |date=2016 |accessdate=2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dayananda.org/kym-yoga-retreat-july2017.html  |title=A Residential Yoga Retreat at Swami Dayananda Ashram - Rishikesh |publisher=Dayanand.org |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Teaching career==
Drawing on his father's teachings, Desikachar went on to develop  [[Viniyoga]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/meet-the-innovators-t-k-v-desikachar  |title=T.K.V. Desikachar Developed Viniyoga to Fit Each Individual Student |publisher=JEANNE RICCIAUG  |date=2007 |accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a term from the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. This highly individualised approach tailors the practice to each student's specific physical and mental condition, emotional state, age, cultural background, and interests. It is completely holistic, with all practice aspects completely aligned with the theory of yoga, especially of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/meet-the-innovators-t-k-v-desikachar  |title=T.K.V. Desikachar Developed Viniyoga to Fit Each Individual Student |publisher=Yogajournal.com |date=2007 |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram (KYM)==
In 1976 TKV Desikachar founded the Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram (KYM), a yoga therapy clinic and yoga center in Madras, India, as a non-profit public charitable trust, teaching yoga inside India. Under Desikachar’s leadership, the KYM offered teacher training and individual instruction in asana, pranayama, meditation, yoga philosophy, and Vedic chanting, as well as pioneering research into the impact of yoga on people suffering from schizophrenia, diabetes, asthma, and depression. KYM also has the SIRO (Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) recognition awarded by the Department for Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India. The institution is a public registered charity, identified by the Department of Family Health and Welfare, by the Government of Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==The Krishnamacharya Healing and Yoga Foundation (KHYF)==
Because the KYM had been primarily set up with legal and statutory provisions to operate only within India, barring it from any activity outside India, TKV Desikachar and his son &amp; student, Dr. Kausthub Desikachar, in 2006 founded the Krishnamacharya Healing and Yoga Foundation also known as [[KHYF]], a partnership firm located in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khyf.net/viniyoga |title=Viniyoga |publisher=khyf.net |date=2018 |accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;This was done to spread the teachings of Viniyoga® globally, as the tradition by then had many international students all over the world. The Krishnamacharya Healing &amp; Yoga Foundation (KHYF) currently claims to be the worldwide headquarters, the anchor and official umbrella organisation representing the Viniyoga® tradition of Professor T Krishnamacharya and Desikachar globally. The KHYF also has copyrighted Viniyoga® in India and European Union.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iayt.org/?page=YogaAndYogaTherapy  |title=
Yoga and Yoga Therapy |publisher=Georg Feuerstein |date=1998 |accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
His wife, Menaka Desikachar, teaches yoga and Vedic chanting at KHYF. Bushan Desikachar, Dr. Kausthub Desikachar and Mekhala Desikachar are his three children. Dr. Kausthub Desikachar is also the Chief Executive and a senior teacher and yoga therapy consultant at KHYF. He was earlier also the Executive Trustree of the Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram till 2012. TKV Desikachar was one of the founders and directors of the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogachicago.com/jan04/desikachar.shtml |title=

==Death== 
Desikachar died on 08 August 2016 in Chennai, India at the age of 78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/Yoga-guru-T.K.V.-Desikachar-no-more/article14560134.ece  |title=Yoga guru T.K.V. Desikachar no more |publisher=The Hindu |date=2016 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Translation sidebar}}

A '''video relay service''' ('''VRS'''), also sometimes known as a '''video interpreting service''' ('''VIS'''), is a [[video telephony|video telecommunication]] service that allows [[deaf]], [[Hearing impairment|hard-of-hearing]], and [[muteness|speech-impaired]] (D-HOH-SI) individuals to communicate over [[video telephone]]s and [[video telephony|similar technologies]] with hearing people in real-time, via a [[sign language]] [[Language interpretation|interpreter]].

A similar video interpreting service called [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI) is conducted through a different organization often called a "Video Interpreting Service Provider" (VISP).&lt;ref name="Deaf council"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050217060701/http://www.deafcouncil.org.uk/ccvisp.htm  UK Council on Deafness: Video Interpreting], Deafcouncil.org.uk website, Colchester, England, U.K.  Retrieved 2009-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

VRS is a newer form of [[telecommunication]] service to the D-HOH-SI community, which had, in the United States, started earlier in 1974 using a simpler non-video technology called [[telecommunications relay service]], also known as "TRS", or simply as "relay service".

VRS services have become well developed nationally in Sweden since 1997&lt;ref name="Hellstrom-1998"&gt;Placencia Porrero, with Gunnar Hellstrom. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OFe_v0Q3SIEC Improving the Quality of Life for the European Citizen: Technology for Inclusive Design and Equality (Volume 4): The Public Swedish Video Relay Service], edited by: Placencia Porrero, E. Ballabio, IOS Press, 1998, pp.267–270, {{ISBN|90-5199-406-0}}, {{ISBN|978-90-5199-406-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the United States since 2003. With the exception of Sweden, VRS has been provided in Europe for only a few years since the mid-2000s, and as of 2010 has not been made available in many European Union countries,&lt;ref name="EUD-2010"&gt;[http://www.eud.eu/ European Union of the Deaf], EUD.eu website.&lt;/ref&gt; with most European countries still lacking the legislation or the financing for large-scale VRS services, and to provide the [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands|necessary telecommunication equipment]] to deaf users. Germany and the Nordic countries are among the other leaders in Europe, while the United States is another world leader in the provisioning of VRS services.

One of the first demonstrations of the ability for [[telecommunication]]s to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[videophone]] (trademarked as the "Picturephone") was introduced to the public at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] –two deaf users were able to communicate freely with each other between the fair and another city.&lt;ref name="BellLabs"&gt;Bell Laboratories RECORD (1969) [http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/picturephone.pdf A collection of several articles on the AT&amp;T Picturephone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623215926/http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/picturephone.pdf |date=2012-06-23 }} (then about to be released) Bell Laboratories, Pg.134–153 &amp; 160–187, Volume 47, No. 5, May/June 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Various universities and other organizations, including [[BT Research#History|British Telecom's Martlesham]] facility, have also conducted extensive research on [[sign language|signing]] via videotelephony.&lt;ref name="NS-1989.08.19"&gt;New Scientist. [https://books.google.com/books?id=K9un2-yueXcC&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Telephones Come To Terms With Sign Language], [[New Scientist]], 19 August 1989, Vol.123, Iss.No.1678, pp.31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sperling"&gt;Sperling, George.

[http://www.zak.co.il/d/deaf-info/old/videophones Moving Picture Transmission at Low Bitrates for Sign Language Communication], Martlesham, England: British Telecom Laboratories, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of sign language via [[videotelephony]] was hampered for many years due to the difficulty of its use over slow [[Plain old telephone service|analogue copper phone lines]],&lt;ref name="Sperling" /&gt; coupled with the high cost of better quality [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN (data) phone lines]].&lt;ref name="NS-1989.08.19" /&gt; Those factors largely disappeared with the introduction of more efficient [[video codec]]s and the advent of lower cost high-speed ISDN data and [[Internet Protocol|IP (Internet)]] services in the 1990s.

===21st century improvements===
Significant improvements in [[videotelephony|video call]] quality of service for the deaf occurred in the United States in 2003 when Sorenson Media Inc. (formerly Sorenson Vision Inc.), a video compression software coding company, developed its VP-100 model stand-alone [[videophone]] specifically for the deaf community.  It was designed to output its video to the user's television in order to lower the cost of acquisition, and to offer remote control and a powerful [[Sorenson codec|video compression codec]] for unequaled video quality and ease of use with video relay services. Favourable reviews quickly led to its popular usage at educational facilities for the deaf, and from there to the greater deaf community.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;Fitzgerald, Thomas J. [https://archive.is/20130130133128/http://tech2.nytimes.com/mem/technology/techreview.html?_r=2&amp;res=9906E1DC163FF93BA25751C1A9659C8B63 For the Deaf, Communication Without the Wait], [[The New York Times]], December 18, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coupled with similar high-quality videophones introduced by other electronics manufacturers, the [[Broadband Internet access|availability of high speed Internet]], and [[Video Relay Service#U.S. VRS regulation|sponsored video relay services]] authorized by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] in 2002, VRS services for the deaf underwent rapid growth in that country.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt;

===Present-day usage===
[[File:Deaf or HoH person at his workplace using a Video Relay Service to communicate with a hearing person via a Video Interpreter and sign language SVCC 2007 Brigitte SLI + Mark.jpg|thumb|left|A deaf or hard-of-hearing person at his workplace using a VRS to communicate with a hearing person in London.]]

Using such video equipment, the [[deafness|deaf, hard-of-hearing]], and speech-impaired can communicate between themselves and with hearing individuals using [[sign language]]. The United States and several other countries compensate companies to provide video relay service (VRS). Telecommunication equipment can be used to talk to others via a sign language interpreter, who uses a conventional telephone at the same time to communicate with the deaf person's party. Video equipment is also used to do on-site sign language translation via [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI).  The relative low cost and widespread availability of [[3G]] [[mobile phone]] technology with video calling capabilities have given deaf and speech-impaired users a greater ability to communicate with the same ease as others. Some wireless operators have even started free sign language gateways.

Sign language interpretation services via VRS or by VRI are useful in the present-day where one of the parties is [[deaf]], [[hard-of-hearing]], or [[Speech disorder|speech-impaired (mute)]]. In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language, such as [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) to spoken French, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) to spoken Spanish, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) to spoken English, and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) also to spoken English (since BSL and ASL are completely distinct to each other), and so on.

Sign language interpreting involves considerable effort on the part of the interpreter, since sign languages are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own [[Linguistics|construction]], [[semantics]] and [[syntax]], different from the aural version of the same principal language.

[[Multilingual]] [[Interpreters#Sign language interpreting|sign language interpreter]]s, who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as from spoken Spanish, to spoken English, to ASL and vice versa), are also available, albeit less frequently.

With video interpreting, [[sign language]] interpreters work remotely with live [[video]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, and converse with the hearing party, and vice versa. Much like [[telephone interpreting]], video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on-site [[Interpreters#Sign language interpreting|interpreters]] are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRS and VRI interpretation requires all parties to have the [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands|necessary equipment]]. Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera remotely, in order to [[Zoom lens|zoom]] in and out or to point the camera toward the party that is signing.

===Canada===
Canada's regulatory [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) issued a policy order on July 21, 2009 requiring [[List of Canadian telephone companies|Canadian telecommunication]], [[List of Canadian mobile phone companies|wireless service]], and [[VoIP]] providers to implement [[Internet Protocol|IP-based]] text relay services by July 21, 2010, and also delaying a decision on the national provision of video relay services in both official languages (ASL &amp; LSQ) for three years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fndc.ca/headlines/2008_vrs_canada_decision.pdf Family Network for Deaf Children Newsletter]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Family Network for Deaf Children, Burnaby, B.C., Fall 2009, pg.11.

The Video Relay Service Trial Project, managed by Telus with Sorenson as the provider, ended on January 15, 2012.   The trial project, which lasted for 18 months, was accessible for approximately 300 participants in BC and Alberta, and cost over $3&amp;nbsp;million (CAD).&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-384.htm CRTC Telecom Decision 2011-384: TELUS Communications Company – Request for a further drawdown from its deferral account for accessibility initiatives], Ottawa, Canadian Radio &amp; Television Commission, 20 June 2011 CRTC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
Denmark's video relay service is currently provided by TegnKom and 12K Studio (12K A/S).

TegnKom was created in 2005 as project in cooperation with AMC Nord (Aarhus Municipality), and only offered to deaf people at their workplace. The service can only be used on Windows-based units with use-license for the preinstalled software (MMX).

12K Studio was created and financed in 2011 by the nationwide sign language interpreter company, 12K A/S. The service can be used on Windows-, OS X/iOS-, Linux- and Android-based units (pc, mac and smartphones) with Skype and/or FaceTime app. 12K Studio service is primary offered to deaf people at their workplace, but can also be used in private for free.

===France===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
There are two companies that provide VRS in France. France has legislated into a law the establishment of three VRS call centres to serve deaf and hard-of-hearing French consumers. However, the long-running disagreement in the French parliament on how to fund the service kept VRS from becoming a reality.

The deaf and hard-of-hearing callers receive the personal budget that covers the cost of VRS and videophone equipment. The personal budget is stipulated for three-year period.

Elioz is a providing both VRI and VRS in France. On the phone, in interview or in meeting, Elioz enables deaf, hard of hearing and hearing people to communicate in sign language, oral language, and writing using [[total conversation]] as a technical foundation of its services.

Tadeo is a communication platform for use between hearing, deaf and hard-of-hearing persons in a professional environment; it offers a [[French Sign Language]] interpretation service, in [[Cued Speech]], and live Transcription, remotely and real-time.

Viable France was established in 2008 and bankrupt in 2015 by the deaf woman to provide VRS and VRI service in France. The company is fully independent of Viable, Inc. and has its own programming and engineering team. A distinction of Viable France is the sales and distribution of its own videophone product that was fully developed and engineered by the deaf engineers at Viable, Inc.

Since October 8, 2018, the operators of the French Federation of Telecoms have launched the first interpersonal telecommunications service dedicated to the deaf, hearing-impaired, deafblind and aphasic, they can now phone independently with the application RogerVoice &lt;ref&gt;https://www.fftelecoms.org/nos-travaux-et-champs-dactions/telecom-responsable/lancement-du-premier-service-de-telecommunications-interpersonnelles-dedie-aux-personnes-sourdes-malentendantes-sourdaveugles-et-aphasiques/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
Currently, Germany has two providers of VRS and VRI: they are TeSS and TeleSign. TeSS was created in 2005 by the consortium of Deutsche Gesellschaft der Hörgeschädigten (German Society of Hearing Impaired), Deutsche Telekom, Bundesnetzagenteur (federal infrastructure regulatory agency), and several other associations. Deutsche Telekom provided the initial funding for feasibility project that started in 2006. TeSS receives the federal subsidy of 1.7 million euros per year and has been awarded two-year contract starting on 1 January 2011 and expiring on 31 December 2012.

The deaf and hard-of-hearing clients who use the VRS for private calls must enrol with TeSS and arrange the payment method. They pay 14 eurocents per minute for text relay and 28 eurocents for video relay. TeSS is operated from eight in the morning to eleven in the evening.

TeleSign provides the combined video relay and video remote interpreting service for the deaf and hard-of-hearing clients at work. The clients must apply to the integration agency for videophones and funds. The subscription is 220 euros per month with one euro per minute of video relay service. The integration agency restricts the monthly call volume to 100 minutes per client. TeleSign operates from seven in the morning to five in the afternoon.

TeSS has recently added the work-related VRS/VRI as to countereffect the demand of integration agency to switch from TeleSign to "cheaper" TeSS service.

Despite the availability of VRS providers in Germany since 2006, the VRS usage is very extremely low as compared to other countries (no more than 1200 clients out of 800,000 deaf people). The integration agency is notorious for rejecting the applications many times on "cost benefit" factor: the agency claims that some deaf clients do not make sufficient VRS calls per month to justify the cost or that the nature of employment does not warrant the need for VRS and videophones. The deaf and hard-of-hearing callers who use VRS for private calls do not receive any form of reimbursement for the VRS calls.

The grassroot movement is gaining momentum in pushing for the free VRS in Germany to subsided by the government through the contribution from the telecom companies.

===Norway===
[[Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration|NAV]], or the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration provides the national relay service for Norway. The service started in 2008, and its usage is increasing.

===Sweden===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
Sweden was the first country in the world to implement a public VRS fully subsidized by the government. The service started as a pilot project in 1996 for ISDN videophones, but started to offer SIP-based services in 2003. Currently the Swedish video relay service is the largest in Europe with an average of 110,000 minutes every month.

There is one national service for the country, which is procured by bids to the National Telecom and Postal Agency (PTS) every four years.

The service is provided by Evantia Oy, with call centers in Örebro, Uppsala and Gotland.

Customers may download a video software application from the service provider, use a web-based application or access the service using Skype and third-party SIP software.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Deaf or HoH person at her workplace using a Video Relay Service to communicate with a hearing person via a video interpreter and sign language IMG 2954.jpg|thumb|right|A person at her workplace communicating with a hearing person via a Video Interpreter (VI) and use of sign language. {{small|(Courtesy '''''SignVideo''''')}}]]

Significan't (UK) Ltd, a deaf and sign language led social enterprise, was the first to establish an IP video relay service in 2004 in London. The SignVideo Contact Centre utilizes qualified and registered sign language interpreters and processed its 10,000th video call in 2006. It secured national contracts with Access to Work and the [[National Health Service]]s to provide [[video remote interpreting]] services throughout the United Kingdom.  In 2010 Significan't introduced the iSignVideo range of videophones and a web-based video calling service, the SignVideo SV2. This service is compliant with the concept of [[Total Conversation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120715092810/http://isignvideo.us/services.htm SignVideo website]&lt;/ref&gt;

connectSCOTLAND BSL is the national VRS service for Scotland and it is free-of-charge for its users. The service was procured by the Scottish Government and it complies with standards for Total Conversation.

===United States===
In the United States, VRS services have been regulated by the [[Federal Communications Commission|U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) since 2002.

====Support for initial trials in Texas====
[[Ed Bosson]] of the [[Texas]] [[Public Utility Commission]] (PUC) envisioned deaf people communicating with videophones more than 10 years before the FCC began reiumbursing for it. Bosson contacted Mark Seeger of [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint Relay]] and discussed the possibilities. Seeger then contacted Sprint technicians to see if the proposal was feasible, and then suggested that Bosson bring the idea to Texas' PUC.

It took Bosson considerable time to convince the Texas PUC and to enlist help from a lawyer in interpreting. He first convinced his supervisor and then, one-by-one, the PUC Commissioners that video relay should become a part of statewide [[Telecommunications Relay Service|Telecom Relay Service]] offering. Bosson was authorized to manage the first video relay service trials, and Sprint became the first service provider to conduct the Texas Video Relay Service tests. Bosson would later receive national awards from ''Smithsonian Computerworld'' and ''TDI'' for his work with VRS.

====Initial Texas trials====
In 1995, the first trial was run by Sprint in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and was limited to four public call centers.

The second trial occurred in 1997 and served ten cities in [[Texas]]. At that point, Sprint and Hanwave Interpreting partnered to provide service. Jon Hodson of Sorenson Communications worked with Ed Bosson during the early stages and provided video conferencing software during the VRS trial in Texas. (At this point the service was called "Video Relay Interpreting" or VRI, which a name that now refers to [[Video Remote Interpreting]]. Linda Nelson has been credited with changing the term from VRI to VRS.) Later, Hanwave Interpreting Service was bought by [[Communication Service for the Deaf]], and Sprint expanded their relay subcontract to include VRS services in addition to the established [[Telecommunications Relay Service|TRS services]].&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt;

In 2002, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and Texas tested a web based VRS, with CSDVRS providing VRS services via the Internet to Washingtonians.

====Implementation across the United States====
In 2000, VRS officially became available throughout the State of Texas. In 2002, the FCC allowed for the reimbursement of interstate VRS providers via an interstate TRS fund administration, making the United States the second country after Sweden to federally subsidize VRS nationwide.

====United States VRS regulation====
The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) is the regulatory body for VRS in the United States.  In addition to overseeing VRS, the FCC also oversees [[Telecommunications Relay Service]]s (TRS), from which the VRS regulatory framework has evolved.  The FCC oversees TRS and VRS as a result of their mandate in the [[Americans With Disabilities Act]] (ADA) to facilitate the provisions equal access to individuals with disabilities over the telephone network.

The Interstate Telecommunications Relay Fund was created by the FCC to fund TRS and its scope was expanded to include VRS.  Funding for the TRS comes from state tax, through rate adjustments or surcharge on local telephone bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/wcb/tapd/trs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104223320/http://transition.fcc.gov/wcb/tapd/trs/ |archivedate=January 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax on revenue is set by the FCC yearly and has been steadily increasing as the number of VRS minutes continues to climb. For 2007 the tax is 7.2/100ths of a penny per dollar of revenue, up from 3.8/100th of a penny in 2000. The current revenue tax of .0072 is expected to generate $553&amp;nbsp;million against telecommunications industry revenue of $76.8&amp;nbsp;billion. The fund is managed by [[National Exchange Carrier Association]] (NECA), which also administers the much larger [[Universal Service Fund]] and publishes the reimbursement rates paid to all relay providers.

In addition to regulating the funding of VRS, the FCC regulates the standards that VRS companies and their employees must follow in handling calls. These regulations ensure that VRS calls are handled appropriately and ethically.

The U.S. FCC-issued rulings include:
* The time it takes an interpreter to answer an incoming VRS call. As of July 1, 2006, VRS providers must answer 80% of calls within two and a half minutes.  Starting on January 1, 2007 VRS providers must answer 80% of calls within two minutes;
* as of January 1, 2006, all VRS providers are required to provide service 24 hours a day, seven days a week;
* reimbursement of VRS Video Mail: if a Hearing person calls a sign language user, but there is no answer, the VI signs a message and delivers it to the sign language user's e-mail, similar to an answering machine. Previously this service was not reimbursed and the cost was absorbed by the VRS provider;
* VRS providers are not permitted to "call back" when a customer hangs up before a VRS call is placed;
* VRS providers must only process calls that either originate or terminate in the US or its territories. For example, a person in Canada may use a VRS service in the United States to call a person in the United States, but not another person in Canada.

====2005 U.S. FCC "Certification Program"====
On December 12, 2005, the Commission released an order adopting new rules permitting carriers desiring to offer IP Relay and VRS services and receive payment from the Fund to seek certification as a provider eligible for compensation from the Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-203A1.doc REPORT AND ORDER AND ORDER ON RECONSIDERATION: Telecommunications Relay Services and Speech-to-Speech Services for Individuals with Hearing and Speech Disabilities, CG Docket No. 03-123], Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C., December 12, 2005. FCC 05-203.&lt;/ref&gt; The record reflects that other entities that desire to offer VRS have been unable to join a certified state program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/prod/ecfs/retrieve.cgi?native_or_pdf=pdf&amp;id_document=6517627451 Ex Parte Submission in the Matter of Telecommunications Relay Services and Speech-to-Speech Services for Individuals with Hearing and Speech Disabilities], Willkie, Farr &amp; GallagHer LLC, June 7, 2005. Submitted by counsel (Snap Ex Parte) asserting that Snap, which desires to offer VRS and receive compensation from the Fund, sought state certification but no state expressed an interest.&lt;/ref&gt;

(i) a description of the forms of TRS to be provided (i.e., VRS, IP Relay and/or IP CTS); (ii) a description of how the provider will meet all non-waived mandatory minimum standards applicable to each form of TRS offered; (iii) a description of the provider's procedures for ensuring compliance with all applicable TRS rules; (iv) a description of the provider's complaint procedures; (v) a narrative describing any areas in which the provider's service will differ from the applicable mandatory minimum standards; (vi) a narrative establishing that services that differ from the mandatory minimum standards do not violate applicable mandatory minimum standards; (vii) demonstration of status as a common carrier; and (viii) a statement that the provider will file annual compliance reports demonstrating continued compliance with these rules.

The rules further provide that after review of the submitted documentation, the Commission shall certify that the provider of IP Relay, VRS and IP CTS is eligible for compensation from the Fund if the Commission determines that the certification documentation:

{{quote|(i) establishes that the provision of IP Relay, VRS and IP CTS ... will meet or exceed all non-waived operational, technical, and functional minimum standards contained in § 64.604; (ii) establishes that the IP Relay, VRS and IP CTS... provider makes available adequate procedures and remedies for ensuring compliance with the requirements of this section and the mandatory minimum standards contained in § 64.604, including that it makes available for its users informational materials on complaint procedures sufficient for users to know the proper procedures for filing complaints; and (iii) where its service differs from the mandatory minimum standards contained in § 64.604, the IP Relay, VRS and IP CTS ... provider establishes that its service does not violate applicable mandatory minimum standards.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}}}

As of 2009 there have been six providers certified becoming eligible for reimbursement from the TRS fund under the rules advocated for by Daryl Crouse and supported by others in the industry.

====Issues in United States VRS administration====
* Numbering standardization competing VRS providers have incompatible numbering schemes.
* Interconnection between the IP-based videophone network and the worldwide telephone network.
* VRS providers encounter difficulties routing 911 calls to the appropriate [[Public Safety Answering Point]] (PSAP). When a VRS user dials 911, the call is first delivered to the VRS, as with any other call placed. However, when the VRS interpreter attempts to connect with the user's local PSAP, the call is instead connected to the PSAP that services the VRS provider's location. Additionally, the information displayed at the PSAP will be that of the VRS provider, not the VRS user. &lt;br /&gt;In order to route emergency calls and accurate information to the appropriate PSAP, VRS providers can send the call information to a national call-routing service. This service determines the appropriate local PSAP for the VRS user and delivers the VRS interpreter's 911 call accordingly. The VRS user can then communicate with the PSAP dispatcher via the VRS interpreter, in order to receive the appropriate emergency services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.911enable.com/news/news.06.20.2008.php 911 Enable Partners with Snap!VRS to Provide Enhanced 911 Video Calling] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826052254/http://www.911enable.com/news/news.06.20.2008.php |date=August 26, 2009 }}, 9-1-1 Enable website, VRS E911, June 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union improves access to emergency services 112 for people with disabilities. The REACH112 project intends to implement a 12-month pilot in Sweden, UK, The Netherlands, France and Spain allowing disabled users to communicate at a distance with each other and directly with the emergency services.
* The VRS industry is under investigation by the FCC, U.S. Postal Inspection Service and FBI for alleged fraudulent activities meant to "manufacture" minutes. The FBI raided the offices of several VRS providers in June 2009 and consequently issued warrants and indictments for fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/November/09-crm-1258.html Twenty-six Charged in Nationwide Scheme to Defraud the FCC’s Video Relay Service Program], U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Public Affairs, November 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC OIG office presented at the RID conference in Philadelphia alerting the field to the problem and urging all those involved to no longer tolerate and such activity by reporting it to the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edsalert.com/2009/07/31/fccs-informational-meeting/ FCC's Informational Meeting] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075645/http://www.edsalert.com/2009/07/31/fccs-informational-meeting/ |date=April 7, 2014 }}, Eds Alerts, July 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical details ==

===Typical calling procedure in the United States===
Normally:
# An individual who communicates by [[American Sign Language]], or another mode of [[manual communication]], such as [[Signing Exact English]], [[Contact sign|contact signing (Pidgin Signed English)]], Cued Speech, or Linguistics of Visual English, uses a [[videophone]] or other video device, such as a [[webcam]], to connect via broadband Internet to a Video Relay Service;
# the caller is routed to a sign language [[Interpreting|interpreter]], known as a Video Interpreter (VI).  The VI is in front of a camera or videophone;
# the video user gives the VI a voice number to dial, as well as any special dialing instructions;
# the VI places the call and interprets as a neutral, non-participating third party. Anything that the audio user says is signed to the video user, and anything signed by the video user is spoken to the audio user;
# once the call is over, the caller can make another call or hang up with the interpreter;
# the company that provides the interpreter services will then submit billings to the FCC.

Hearing people can also contact a deaf, hard-of-hearing, or speech-disabled person via VRS. To initiate a call, a hearing person calls a VRS and connects to a video interpreter who then contacts the video user.

Some VRS services also offer:
* Voice Carry Over: The video user may use his/her own voice instead of the interpreter speaking;
* Hearing Carry Over: the video user may listen for him/herself instead of relying on the interpreter;
* Language Preference: The video user requests that the interpreter use American Sign Language;
* the ability to connect to a sign language interpreter who can interpret into another language, such as Spanish.

===Videotelephony descriptive names &amp; terminology===
{{see also|List of video telecommunication services and product brands}}
The name ''[[videophone]]'' is not as standardized as its earlier counterpart, the ''telephone'', resulting in a variety of names and terms being used worldwide, and even within the same region or country.  Videophones are also known as '''videotelephones''' (or '''video telephones''') and often by an early trademarked name "'''Picturephone'''", which was the world's first commercial videophone produced in volume. The compound name'' "videophone" ''slowly entered into general use after 1950,&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/videophone Videophone definition], Merriam-Webster Online, retrieved April 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; although'' "video telephone" ''likely entered the lexicon earlier after'' "video" ''was coined in 1935.&lt;ref name="ED"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=video&amp;searchmode=none Video definition], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; ''Videophone calls'' (also: ''videocalls'' and ''video chat''),&lt;ref&gt;PC Magazine.

Retrieved 19 August 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; differ from [[videoconferencing]] in that they expect to serve individuals, not groups.&lt;ref name="Mulbach-1995c"&gt;Mulbach, 1995. Pg. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as [[Broadband Internet access|increased bandwidth]] and sophisticated [[software client]]s that can allow for multiple parties on a call. In general everyday usage the term ''videoconferencing'' is now frequently used instead of ''videocall'' for point-to-point calls between two units. Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a ''video link''.

''[[Webcam]]s'' are popular, relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via personal computers, and can be used with many [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Software Client brands|software clients]] for both video calls and videoconferencing.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Negash, Michael E.

Note costing: "....students had the option to install a webcam on their end (a basic webcam costs about $40.00) to view the class in session."&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Video conferencing systems meant for multiple participants|videoconference system]]'' is generally higher cost than a videophone and deploys greater capabilities. A ''videoconference'' (also known as a ''videoteleconference'') allows two or more locations to communicate via live, simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. This is often accomplished by the use of a [[multipoint control unit]] (a centralized distribution and call management system) or by a similar non-centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit. Again, technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web-based applications.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Stephen.

The '''WordMasters Challenge''' is an international [[Language Arts]] competition for students in grades 3 - 8.  The assigned words increase in difficulty at each grade level. The "Challenge" tests take place three times a year in the students' classrooms and are scored on how well the kids are able to use their knowledge of the words to complete twenty [[analogies]]. The WordMasters Challenge encourages growth not only in [[vocabulary]], but in [[critical thinking]] and [[verbal reasoning]].  Nearly 3,000 teams from throughout the United States and several foreign countries participate in this yearly competition.

There are three competitions each school year taking place about two months apart. On the first competition, students are tested on 25 words assigned to them. On the second competition, they are assigned 25 new words and are tested on all 50 words. On the third competition, they are assigned 25 additional words and are tested on all 75 words they have learned over the course of the school year.

'''Zelia N. Breaux''' (February 6, 1880 &amp;ndash; October 31, 1956) was an American music instructor and musician who played the trumpet, violin and piano. She organized the first music department at Oklahoma's [[Langston University]] and the school's first orchestra. As the Supervisor of Music for the segregated African American schools in [[Oklahoma City]], Breaux organized bands, choral groups and orchestras, establishing a music teacher in each school in the district. She had a wide influence on many musicians including Charlie Christian and Jimmy Rushing, as well as novelist [[Ralph Ellison]]. Breaux was the first woman president of the Oklahoma Association of Negro Teachers and was posthumously inducted into the Oklahoma YWCA Hall of Fame, [[Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame]] and the Oklahoma Bandmasters Association Hall of Fame. The Oklahoma City/County Historical Society made a posthumous presentation of its Pathmaker Award to Breaux in 2017.

===Oklahoma City years===
In 1918, Breaux left Langston and accepted the position as Supervisor of Music for the segregated African American schools in [[Oklahoma City]]. She established a music teacher in each grade school in the district, organized the Oklahoma City Community Band, and headed the music department at Douglass High School. While at Douglass, she organized a twenty-four-voice chorus, an eighteen-piece symphony orchestra, and several glee clubs.&lt;ref name="Atkins (2009)" /&gt; At this time, it was unusual for black schools to offer music training beyond voice instruction, but Breaux believed that the discipline and instruction of classical music served as a catalyst for elevating and mastering life.&lt;ref name="Jackson (2007)" /&gt;

Breaux believed in her independence. She lived in Oklahoma City and taught, managed the Aldridge theater and rental properties, commuting back and forth to [[Langston, Oklahoma|Langston]], where her husband lived. She hired a live-in cook to prepare her meals.&lt;ref name="Jackson (2007)" /&gt;
