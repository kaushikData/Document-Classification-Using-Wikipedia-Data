The '''1968 flu pandemic''' was a [[Pandemic Severity Index|category 2]] [[flu pandemic]] whose outbreak in 1968 and 1969 killed an estimated one million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paul |first=William E. |title=Fundamental Immunology |pages=1273 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oPSG1PGmZUkC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/usandworld/43705182.html |title=World health group issues alert Mexican president tries to isolate those with swine flu |date=April 25, 2009 |publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=2009-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427103848/http://www.jsonline.com/news/usandworld/43705182.html |archivedate=April 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/columnists/michele_mandel/2009/04/26/9248411-sun.html |title=No need to panic ... yet Ontario officials are worried swine flu could be pandemic, killing thousands |last=Mandel |first=Michael |date=April 26, 2009 |publisher=Toronto Sun |accessdate=2009-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427101524/http://www.torontosun.com/news/columnists/michele_mandel/2009/04/26/9248411-sun.html |archivedate=April 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was caused by an [[H3N2]] strain of the [[influenza A virus]], descended from [[H2N2]] through [[antigenic shift]], a [[genetics|genetic]] process in which [[gene]]s from multiple subtypes [[Reassortment|reassorted]] to form a new virus. Because it originated in [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], the pandemic is also referred to as '''Hong Kong flu'''.

==The 1968–1969 pandemic==
The first record of the outbreak in [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] appeared on 13 July 1968. By the end of July 1968, extensive outbreaks were reported in [[Vietnam]] and [[Singapore]]. Despite the fatality of the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] in [[China]], little improvement had been made regarding the handling of such [[epidemic]]s. ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper was actually the first source to sound alarm regarding this new possible [[pandemic]].

By September 1968, the flu reached [[India]], the [[Philippines]], northern [[Australia]] and [[Europe]]. That same month, the virus entered [[California]] from returning [[Vietnam War]] [[United States Military|troops]] but did not become widespread in the [[United States]] until December 1968.  It would reach [[Japan]], Africa and South America by 1969.&lt;ref name="Starling" /&gt; The outbreak in Hong Kong, where density is about 500 people per acre, reached maximum intensity in two weeks, lasting six months in total from July to December 1968, however worldwide deaths from this virus peaked much later, in December 1968 and January 1969. By that time, public health warnings&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=F. Avery |last=Jones |title=Winter Epidemics |journal=[[British Medical Journal]] |year=1968 |volume=1968 |issue=4 |pages=327 |doi=10.1136/bmj.4.5626.327-c }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and virus descriptions&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Coleman |first=Marion T. |last2=Dowdle |first2=Walter R. |last3=Pereira |first3=Helio G. |last4=Schild |first4=Geoffrey C. |last5=Chang |first5=W.

In comparison to other pandemics, the Hong Kong flu yielded a low death rate, with a [[case-fatality ratio]] below 0.5% making it a category 2 disease on the [[Pandemic Severity Index]]. The pandemic infected an estimated 500,000 Hong Kong residents, 15% of the population.&lt;ref name="Starling"&gt;{{cite book |last=Starling |first=Arthur |title=Plague, SARS, and the Story of Medicine in Hong Kong |publisher=HK University Press |year=2006 |isbn=962-209-805-3 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBx6McA35iYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, approximately 33,800 people died,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |url=http://www.pandemicflu.gov/general/historicaloverview.html  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331065518/http://www.pandemicflu.gov/general/historicaloverview.html |archivedate=2009-03-31 |title=Pandemics and Pandemic Threats since 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[conjoined twins]] [[Daisy and Violet Hilton]] in January 1969.

The same virus returned the following years: a year later, in late 1969 and early 1970, and in 1972.

Fewer people died during this pandemic than the two previous pandemics for various reasons:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/ops/hsc-scen-3_pandemic-1968.htm|title=1968  Hong Kong Flu|first=John|last=Pike|date=|website=www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324200512/http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/ops/hsc-scen-3_pandemic-1968.htm|archivedate=24 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# some immunity against the N2 flu virus may have been retained in populations struck by the [[Asian Flu]] strains which had been circulating since 1957;
# the pandemic did not gain momentum until near the winter school holidays, thus limiting the infection spreading;
# improved [[medical care]] gave vital support to the very ill;
# the availability of [[antibiotics]] that were more effective against [[Secondary infection|secondary bacterial infections]].

== Clinical data ==
Flu symptoms lasted four to five days (some symptoms lasted up to two weeks).&lt;ref name="Starling" /&gt;
Those over the age of 65 were most likely to die.

== Virology ==
[[File:Influenza virus.png|thumb|300px|right|The [[influenza]] [[virus]]es that caused the Hong Kong flu. (magnified approximately 100,000 times)]]
The Hong Kong flu was the first known outbreak of the [[H3N2]] strain, though there is serologic evidence of H3N1 infections [[Www.goo.gl.com/|in]] the late 19th century.
The virus was isolated in [[Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong|Queen Mary Hospital]].

In the 1968 pandemic vaccine became available one month after the outbreaks peaked in the US.

Both the [[H2N2]] and H3N2 [[pandemic flu]] strains contained genes from [[avian influenza]] viruses. The new subtypes arose in pigs coinfected with avian and human viruses and were soon transferred to humans. Swine were considered the original "intermediate host" for influenza, because they supported reassortment of divergent subtypes. However, other hosts appear capable of similar coinfection (e.g., many poultry species), and direct transmission of avian viruses to humans is possible. H1N1 may have been transmitted directly from birds to humans (Belshe 2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.influenzareport.com/ir/ai.htm Chapter Two : Avian Influenza by Timm C. Harder and Ortrud Werner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510091835/http://www.influenzareport.com/ir/ai.htm |date=2016-05-10 }} from excellent free on-line Book called ''Influenza Report 2006'' which is a medical textbook that provides a comprehensive overview of epidemic and pandemic influenza.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hong Kong flu strain shared internal genes and the [[Neuraminidase deficiency|neuraminidase]] with the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] ([[H2N2]]). Accumulated antibodies to the neuraminidase or internal proteins may have resulted in much fewer casualties than most [[pandemic]]s. However, cross-immunity within and between subtypes of influenza is poorly understood.

"Three strains of Hong Kong influenza virus isolated from humans were compared with a strain isolated from a calf for their ability to cause disease in calves. One of the human strains. A/Aichi/2/68, was detected for five days in a calf, but all three failed to cause signs of disease. Strain A/cal/Duschanbe/55/71 could be detected for seven days and caused an influenza-like illness in calves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Campbell |first=Charles H. |last2=Easterday |first2=Bernard C. |last3=Webster |first3=Robert G. |year=1977 |title=Strains of Hong Kong Influenza Virus in Calves |journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=135 |issue=4 |pages=678–680 |doi=10.2307/30107903 |pmid=853249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20962">'''Abortion in Italy''' became legal in May 1978, when [[Italy|Italian]] women were allowed to terminate a [[pregnancy]] on request during the first 90 days. A proposal to repeal the law was considered in a 1981 national referendum, but was rejected by nearly 68% of voters; another referendum aimed at eliminating the restrictions was rejected by 88.4%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/ccies/it.php#contracep&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Italian women are eligible to request an abortion for health, economic or social reasons, including the circumstances under which conception occurred. Abortions are performed free-of-charge in public hospitals or in private structures authorized by the regional health authorities. The law also allows termination in the second trimester of the pregnancy only when the life of the woman would be at risk if the pregnancy is carried to term or the fetus carries genetic or other serious malformations which would put the mother at risk of serious psychological or physical consequences.

The law states that, unless a state of emergency requires immediate intervention, a period of seven days, not compulsory, has to occur between the medical authorization and the effective date of the termination. Although the law only permits pregnancy termination to women at least eighteen years old, it also includes provisions for women younger than eighteen, who can request the intervention of a judge when the legal tutor refuses the intervention, or there are reasons to exclude the legal tutor from the process. The judge has to make a decision within five days of the request. Women younger than eighteen don't need parental consent in case of urgent situation or after 90 days.&lt;ref name=ItalianLaw1978no194/&gt;

==Legal induced abortions==

Since 1980, the [[Laboratory]] of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the High Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, ISS) in Rome has maintained a surveillance system for legal induced abortions. This system is based on quarterly reporting by the regional health authorities. A standardized form is compiled that contains aggregate data on major social-demographic characteristics of the woman (age, residency status, marital status, reproductive history) as well as details about the procedure (weeks of gestation, whether the procedure is elective or performed on an emergency basis, where certification was issued, type of procedure and location where it was performed, duration of stay, and immediate complications). This information is then sent to the ISS, which examines data quality and performs data analysis of trends, geographic distribution, and characteristics of women undergoing abortion. These analyses are performed annually by the ISS and the Ministry of Health (MH) and presented by the Minister of Health to the Parliament; results are also published in ISTISAN reports, an official publication of the ISS. Italy is considered to have one of the most accurate and timely abortion surveillance systems in the world.

==Abortion rate==
In 1993, the [[abortion]] ratio in Italy was 9.8 per 1,000 live births, less than 1% (Table 2). However, this measure also varies regionally. The central and northern regions (in particular [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Liguria]] and [[Tuscany]]) are characterized by relatively low TFRs (one lifetime birth per woman), high abortion rates and elevated abortion ratios. While low levels of fertility can also be found in some of the northwestern regions, abortion rates are moderate in these regions (9-12 abortions per 1,000); therefore, abortion ratios in a few of these areas are closer to the national level.

Subsequent to the legalization of abortion in Italy in 1978, abortion rates among Italian women first rose and then declined steadily, from a peak of 16.9 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age in 1983 to 9.8 per 1,000 in 1993. Abortion rates vary considerably by [[geographic]] region, with rates typically highest in the more secular regions and lowest in regions where [[traditional values]] predominate. Data from 1981 and 1991 indicate that age-specific abortion rates decreased during the 1980s for all age-groups, with the largest declines occurring in regions with the highest levels of [[abortion]]. Moreover, a shift in the age distribution of abortion rates occurred during the 1980s, with women aged 30–34 registering the highest abortion rate in 1991, whereas in 1981 the highest level of abortion occurred among those aged 25–29. The abortion rate among adolescent women was low at both times (7.6 per 1,000 in 1981 and 4.6 per 1,000 in 1991). These data are based only on reported legal abortions; the number of clandestine abortions remains unknown.

A phenomenon to emerge in recent years has been an increase in the number of abortions requested by immigrant women. Among the 138,357 abortions performed in 1993, 13,826 (10%) involved foreign residents, an increase from 9,850 in 1996. This increase is most likely due to the rising number of immigrant women in Italy; the resident permits, for example, according to the data of the National Statistics Institute (ISTAT), have increased from 678,000 in 1995 to 1,100,000 in 1999. Based on estimates of the population of immigrant women 18–49 years of age, Istat has calculated that the AR for immigrant women was 28.7/1000 in 1998, approximately three times higher than that observed in Italian citizens. Indeed, the increase in the numbers of immigrant women may be the main cause of the leveling-off of the abortion rate in Italy. If the analysis of trends is limited to 1996-1998, years for which information is most complete on residency status, the number of abortions in Italian women declined from 127,700 in 1996 to 123,728 in 1998.

==Abortion incidence==
In 1993, approximately 140,000 induced abortions were performed in Italy. In comparison, the average annual number during the period 1982-1984 was more than 230,000. Similar patterns can also be seen in abortion rates. After legalization, abortion rates rose modestly, increasing from 13.7 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 in 1979 to a peak of 16.9 per 1,000 in 1982 and 1983. During the period 1982-1984, Italian abortion rates stabilized, and this period was followed by a steady decline: By 1986, the rate had dropped to 14.0 abortions per 1,000 women, and by 1990 it had reached 11.1 per 1,000; by 1993, the abortion rate had decreased to 9.8 per 1,000.&lt;ref name="bettarini1996"&gt;Salvini Bettarini, Silvana.

Family Planning Perspectives. &lt;http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2826796.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2010}}, the abortion rate was 10.0 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44 years.&lt;ref name="un2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law n. 194==

=== Historical background===

Before the approval of the law, in 1978, abortion was considered to be a crime against the integrity and the bloodline, as stated in the [[Criminal code|Criminal Code]] book 2 Title X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=C'è chi dice no. Dalla leva all'aborto. Come cambia l'obiezione di coscienza (Vol. 747)|last=Lalli|first=C.|publisher=Il Saggiatore|year=2011|isbn=9788865761465|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the article 546 prohibited all different type of abortions, in case of it the punishment could have been from 2 to 5 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondodiritto.it/codici/codice-penale/art-546-codice-penale-aborto-di-donna-consenziente.html|title=Art 546 codice penale aborto di donna consenziente  »|website=Mondo Diritto|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only exception was so called, state of necessity which entails a current and imminent danger to the woman.

The turning point for the [[abortion debate]] was the decision number 27 of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]] on 18 February 1975 the hat stated that article 546 is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.giurcost.org/decisioni/1975/0027s-75.html|title=Consulta OnLine - Sentenza n. 27 del 1975|website=www.giurcost.org|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Court ruled that against article 546 was against article 31 of the [[Italian Constitution]], which said that: "It protects maternity, infancy and youth, promoting the institutions necessary thereto".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Italy|title=Constitution of Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, article 546 is against article 32 of the Constitution, which specified that the Republic safeguards health as a fundamental right of the individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Italian magazine [[Panorama (magazine)|''Panorama'']], in 1974, found out that a significant number of illegal abortions was performed every year, and it suggests that all women had either an abortion or knew a friend who had it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'aborto in Italia: storia di una legge.|last=Scirè|first=G.|publisher=Mondadori|year=2011|isbn=9788861595231|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary debate===

In the early seventies with the presentation of two bills originating from the [[Italian Radicals (disambiguation)|radical left]] which aimed to legalize [[therapeutic abortion]]. These bills did not reach the discussion state before the dissolution of parliament and the calling of new elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'aborto. Storia e attualità di un problema sociale|last=Flamigni|first=Carlo|publisher=Pendragon|year=2008|isbn=9788883426360|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 the fight to legalize abortion was begun with the Fortuna first bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aggiornamentisociali.it/easyne2/LYT.aspx?Code=agso&amp;IDLYT=769&amp;ST=SQL&amp;SQL=ID_Documento=1739|title=La proposta di legge Fortuna sull'aborto|language=it|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortuna’s law provided for the possibility of therapeutic abortions but is required the agreement of 3 doctors and precludes abortion unless the woman was seriously ill or mad. It also demanded the consent of parents for girls under 18. After the election in 1976, the [[pro-abortion]] majority was committed to legalization and nine different bills were presented from June 1976 till April 1978. Finally, the bill was passed and published on 22 May 1978.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====The influence of feminism====

From the end of the 1960s, [[feminism]] played a leading role in reorganizing the terms of the debate about women and their condition. [[Abortion]] has united feminist groups which have fought to demand abortion right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?hl=it&amp;lr=&amp;id=3JKQrd8hATMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Cadwell+abortion+italy+&amp;ots=Days4Pwr4r&amp;sig=A-kb3NaNM8Hz2k1qBBJgUn6OMgw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Feminism and Materialism: Women and Modes of Production|last=Kuhn|first=Annette|last2=Wolpe|first2=AnnMarie|date=2012-10-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415635059|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peak was reached between 1974 and 1976 with the mass mobilization. This coincides with the political struggle for [[abortion]], but, by the time the abortion law was passed in 1978, the major moment of activity had passed.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-21260-6_5|title=Women and Italy|last=Caldwell|first=Lesley|date=1991|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London|isbn=9780333455777|series=University of Reading European and International Studies|pages=95–116|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-21260-6_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Catholic church====

The power and strength of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the organized [[Catholic Church|church]] is exerted in economic and political terms, but it is also exercised at a more local level through its strength in the provision of social services and neighborhood organization. The church statement on sexuality and the family represent the most significant proportion of its public statement to the faithful. It is a central doctrinal area and one through which the church is intent on reinforcing and extending its control.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Lesley|date=1981|title=Abortion in Italy|jstor=1394759|journal=Feminist Review|issue=7|pages=49–63|doi=10.2307/1394759}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the church, abortion involves the destruction of human life and can never be accepted regardless of the difficulties this position imposes. This meant that the church could not admit the possibility of legal abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/emint14&amp;div=13&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=&amp;collection=journals|title=Redirecting...|website=heinonline.org|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political party [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], was the party which has governed Italy since 1948, together with the [[Italian Communist Party (2016)|Italian Communist Party’s]] interpretation of the importance of [[Catholicism]] for any analysis of the balance of forces.  The council of Italian bishops issued a statement confirming the church’s position on abortion and arguing against the legalization.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== The content of Law n. 194 ===

The law 194 on the adoption of [[social protection]] of motherhood and the voluntary termination of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:1978-5-22;194!vig|title=*** NORMATTIVA ***|website=www.normattiva.it|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art. 1 stated that the State guarantees the right to responsible and planned parenthood, recognizes the social value of motherhood, and shall protect human life from the beginning.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/history/degrazia/courseworks/legge_194.pdf|title=Law 194|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Italian legislation|website=Columbia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the voluntary [[termination of pregnancy]] as covered by this law shall not be a means of birth control.

Art. 2 regards the function of family counseling center (''consultori familiari'') and what it is their role in relation to the law. Family counselling centers shall assist any pregnant woman:

* By informing her of her rights under State legislation and of the social, health and welfare services actually available from agencies. 
* By informing her of appropriate ways to take advantage of the provisions of labor legislation design to protect any pregnant women 
*  By suggesting to the local agencies solution to problem relate to motherhood 
* By helping to overcome the factors which might lead the woman to have her pregnancy terminated.

The law presents two different scenarios:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/abortion-legislation/europe.php|title=Abortion Legislation in Europe|date=January 2015|website=www.loc.gov|language=en|others=Acosta, Luis; Yatsunska-Poff, Olena; Zeldin, Wendy; Boring, Nicolas; Hofverberg, Elin; Feikert-Ahalt, Clare; Figueroa, Dante; Soares, Eduardo; Roudik, Peter; Rodriguez-Ferrand, Graciela|accessdate=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1)   [[Pregnancy]] during the first 90 days (Art. 4) &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In order to practice the [[termination of pregnancy]] during the first 90 days, women whose situation is such that continuation of the pregnancy, childbirth, or motherhood would seriously compromise their physical or mental health, in view of their state of health, their economic, social, or family circumstances, the circumstances in which conception occurred, or the chance that the child would be born with abnormalities or malformations, shall apply to a public counselling center or to a fully authorized medical-social agency in the region, or to a [[physician]] of her choice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Art. 5 extend the explanation of family counselling centre when economic, social or family circumstances motivate the reasons to interrupt the pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

2)   Pregnancy after the first 90 days (Art.6) &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Voluntary termination of pregnancy may be performed after the first 90 days when the [[pregnancy]] or childbirth is a serious threat to the woman’s life or when the pathological processes constitute a serious threat to the woman's physical or mental health, such as those associated with serious abnormalities or malformations of the fetus, have been diagnosed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Furthermore, there is the need for guardian's approval if a girl that is under 18 years old or the woman that is interdicted in order to carry out abortion (Art. 12 and Art. 14).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Articles 18 and 19 cover the consequences for any person inducing a termination without the consent of the woman.

===Conscientious objection===
[[File:Geographical distribution of conscientious objectors in Italy.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Geographical distribution of conscientious objectors in Italy&lt;ref name=EDJNet /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Abortions per gynecologist in Italy.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Abortions per gynecologist in Italy per working week in 2016 (data for Lombardia is of 2016)&lt;ref name=EDJNet /&gt;]]
The law gives the option for [[health professional]]s to claim the right to refuse to perform abortion. If the health personnel demands to be [[conscientious objector]], they have to declare it in advance (Art.9). However, conscientious objection may not be invoked by health professionals if the personal intervention is essential in order to save the life of a woman in imminent danger.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Italy keeps a record of the objecting doctors. According to data from the Ministry of Health, between 1997 and 2016 there was a 12.9% increase in the number of gynecologists who refuse to perform abortions on moral grounds, from 62.8% to 70.9%, the highest percentage ever recorded. As of 2016 the percentage is higher than the national average in [[Southern Italy]] (83.5%) and [[Insular Italy|Sicily and Sardinia]] (77.7%), and lower in [[Central Italy|Central]] (70.1%) and [[Northern Italy]] (63.9%). The percentage is growing in all the [[macroregion|macroregions]] except the North. As a result, voluntary abortion is performed only in 60% of the hospitals of the country. Also, non-objecting doctors suffers discrimination, and -in some provinces- needs to perform record-numbers of abortions, up to 15.8 per week in the [[province of Taranto]] ([[Apulia]]) or 12.2 in the [[province of Catania]] ([[Sicily]]).&lt;ref name=EDJNet&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tamma |first1=Paola |title=Even where abortion is legal, access is not granted|url=https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Even-where-abortion-is-legal-access-is-not-granted |accessdate=22 August 2018 |work=VoxEurop/EDJNet |date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A resolution by the [[Council of Europe]] has found several violations of the [[European Social Charter]] in the situation:
* [[right to health|right to protection of health]] (art. 11) of women seeking abortion;
* [[right to work]] (art. 1) and to [[dignity]] at work (art. 26) of non-objecting medical practitioners, because of different treatment and moral harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Resolution CM/ResChS(2016)3 |url=https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectId=0900001680687bdc |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Social Charter (Revised) |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168007cf93 |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ainslie Dixon Meares''' (3 March 1910{{spaced ndash}}19 September 1986) was an [[Australian]] [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]], scholar of hypnotism, psychotherapist, authority on stress and a prolific author who lived and practised in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i2spAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y-YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2704%2C4532118 "Obituary: Dr. Ainslie Meares, Cancer Victim's Guru",''The Sydney Morning Herald", (Monday, 22 September 1986), p.8].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{Hypnosis}}
Ainslie Meares was born in [[Malvern, Victoria]], on 3 March 1910, the eldest son of medical practitioner Albert George Meares, (1875-1928),&lt;ref&gt;Albert's father, [[George Meares]] {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CMG}} (1825-1903) had been [[List of mayors and lord mayors of Melbourne#Mayors .281842.E2.80.931902.29|Lord Mayor of Melbourne]] from 1880 to 1881, and a [[Victorian Legislative Council|Member of the Victorian Legislative Council (MLC)]] from 1882 to 1886.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He died on 20 March 1928 ([http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3919332 "Deaths", ''The Argus'', (Wednesday, 21 March 1928), p.1]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/179707914 "Large Estate: Former Melbourne Doctor", ''The (Brisbane) Telegraph'', (Saturday, 5 May 1928), p.9]; [http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3952246 "Personal", ''The Argus'', (Saturday, 5 May 1928), p30].&lt;/ref&gt; and Eva Gertrude Meares (1875-1926) (née Ham),&lt;ref&gt;Eva's father, [[Cornelius Ham|Cornelius Job Ham]] (1837-1909), had been [[List of mayors and lord mayors of Melbourne#Mayors .281842.E2.80.931902.29|Lord Mayor of Melbourne]] from 1881 to 1882, and a [[Victorian Legislative Council|Member of the Victorian Legislative Council (MLC)]] from 1882 to 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;She died on 30 June 1926 ([https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vLgUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8tcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6159%2C116445 "Deaths", ''The Age'', (Friday, 2 July 1926), p1]).&lt;/ref&gt; who were married on 14 July 1903.&lt;ref&gt;"Weddings: Meares—Ham", ''The (Melbourne) Leader'', (Saturday, 25 July 1903), p.38].&lt;/ref&gt;  He married Bonnie Sylvia Byrne on 18 June 1934.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/10947898 "Parchment and Ice-Blue: Meares—Byrne Wedding", ''The Argus'', (Tuesday, 19 June 1934), p.10].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meares was educated at [[Melbourne Grammar School]], where he boxed and played tennis, at [[Trinity College (University of Melbourne)|Trinity College]],&lt;ref&gt;see ''The Fleur-de-Lys'' (1931-1934), passim.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[University of Melbourne]], from which he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science in Agriculture|Bachelor of Agricultural Science]] degree in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/10920317 "University of Melbourne: Supplementary Examinations: February, 1934: Fourth Year Bachelor of Agricultural Science", ''The Argus'', (Wednesday, 21 March 1934), p.14].&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] degree in 1940.

Meares received his [[Psychiatrist|Diploma in Psychological Medicine]] from the University of Melbourne in September 1947,&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/22504612 "Conferring of Degrees: Diplomas", ''The Argus'', (Tuesday, 2 September 1947), p.15].&lt;/ref&gt; and, on the basis of his presentation of a collection of 17 published papers relating to medical hypnotism (with each paper being independent of the others), he was awarded the higher degree of [[Doctor of Medicine#United Kingdom, Ireland and Commonwealth countries (excluding Canada)|Doctor of Medicine]] by the University of Melbourne in 1958.

Meares also served as a captain in the [[Royal Australian Army Medical Corps]] (1941–1945).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=A&amp;veteranId=471771 Australian Army Service Record: Meares, Ainslie Dixon (VX64992)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/NAAMedia/ViewPDF.aspx?B=6111455&amp;D=D National Archives of Australia: Service Record: Meares, Ainslie Dixon (VX64992)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meares was a founding fellow of the [[Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists]] and, for a time, the president of the [[International Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bower|first1=H.|title=Obituary:  Ainslie Dixon Meares|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|volume=21, No. 2|issue=June, 1987|pages=251–2|doi=10.3109/00048678709160920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypnotism==
Meares was an internationally recognised expert in the medical uses of hypnotism&lt;ref&gt;Westmore (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote a number of books describing his approach. His work may be divided into 3 periods: the hypnosis period, relief without drugs period and the stillness meditation period. These categories reflect the simplification and fine tuning of his method that occurred over time.&lt;ref&gt;Ainslie Meares on Meditation by Owen Bruhn. 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Meares died suddenly, of [[pneumonia]], in a Melbourne hospital on 19 September 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i2spAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y-YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2704%2C4532118 "Deaths", ''The Age'', (Monday, 22 September 1986), p.18].&lt;/ref&gt; He was cremated.&lt;ref&gt;Westmore (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Bonnie, died on 27 December 1978. He was survived by their three children, Russell Meares (also a psychiatrist), Garda Meares Langley and Sylvia Meares Black.

== Publications ==
Meares was  a prolific author, mainly on psychiatry, hypnotism, the treatment of cancer, and meditation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21568">'''Alcohol consumption in Russia''' remains [[List of countries by alcohol consumption per capita|among the highest in the world]]. According to a 2011 report by the [[World Health Organization]], annual per capita consumption of alcohol in Russia was about 15.76 litres, the fourth-highest volume in Europe.&lt;ref name="WHO-report"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msbgsruprofiles.pdf | title=Global status reporton alcohol and health - WHO | date=2011 | accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another dangerous trait of Russian alcohol consumption pattern was the high volume of spirits compared with other alcoholic drinks (such as beer or red wine).&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev A.]], Khaltourina D. [https://www.academia.edu/32754260/Russian_Demographic_Crisis_in_Cross-National_Perspective._In_Russia_and_Globalization._Baltimore_John_Hopkins_University_Press Russian Demographic Crisis in Cross-National Perspective.

Russia currently implements a variety of anti-[[alcoholism]] measures (banning spirits and beer trade at night, raising taxes, and others). According to medical officials, these policies have resulted in a considerable fall of alcohol consumption volumes, to 13.5 litres by 2013, with wine and beer overtaking spirits as the main source of beverage alcohol.&lt;ref name="lenta"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/17/alcohol/ | title=Россияне стали меньше пить | date=October 17, 2013 | accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These levels are comparable with European Union averages. Alcohol producers claim that falling legal consumption is accompanied by growth in sales of illegally produced drink.&lt;ref name="rosinvest"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rosinvest.com/acolumn/blog/alkogol/507.html | title=Анализ алкогольного рынка в 2013 году - рост и падение | publisher=RosInvest | date=March 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High volumes of alcohol consumption have serious negative effects on Russia's social fabric and bring political, economic and public health ramifications. Alcoholism has been a problem throughout the country's history because drinking is a pervasive, socially acceptable behaviour in Russian society&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev A.]], Khaltourina D.

It has repeatedly been targeted as a major national problem,&lt;ref name=RIA1&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia declares war on alcoholism |newspaper=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=January 14, 2010 |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100114/157541676.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pravda&gt;{{cite news |title=Each of 7 million Russian alcoholics drinks 27 liters of alcohol a year |newspaper=[[Pravda]] |date=November 9, 2006 |url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/stories/09-11-2006/85432-alcoholism-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; with mixed results.

==History==
{{see also|Prohibition in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union}}
Legend holds that the tenth-century Russian prince [[Vladimir the Great]] rejected [[Islam]] as a state religion for the country because of its prohibition of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Primary Chronicle, year 6494 (986)&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, alcohol has been tolerated or even encouraged as a source of revenue.&lt;ref name=McKee&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/alcalc/34.6.824 |last1=McKee |first1=Martin |year=1999 |title=Alcohol in Russia |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |publisher=Oxford Journals |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=824–829 |url=http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/34/6/824 |pmid=10659717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===

In 1909 average alcohol consumption was said to be 11 bottles per capita per year. An estimated 4% of the population of St.Petersburg were estimated to be alcoholics in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khwaja|first1=Barbara|title=Health Reform in Revolutionary Russia|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/2017/05/26/health-reform-revolutionary-russia/|accessdate=26 May 2017|publisher=Socialist Health Association|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Bolshevik Party]] came to power, they made repeated attempts to reduce consumption in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=McKee/&gt; However, by 1925, vodka had reappeared in state-run stores.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]] reestablished a state monopoly to generate revenue.&lt;ref name=McKee/&gt;

The campaign was temporarily successful in reducing per capita alcohol consumption and improving quality-of-life measures such as life expectancies and crime rates, but it was deeply unpopular among the population and it ultimately failed.

=== 21st century ===
In 2006, a new alcohol [[Excise stamps of Russia|excise stamp]] known as the EGAIS system was introduced, allowing to identify every bottle sold in Russia through a centralized data system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia may soon be booze free|url=http://www.fin24.com/International/Russia-may-soon-be-booze-free-20060727|accessdate=4 September 2017|work=Fin24|date=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] nearly doubled the minimum price of a bottle of vodka in an effort to combat the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/worldview/100117/russia-vodka-alcoholism |title=Opinion: Why a $3 bottle of vodka won't cut it |author =Kate Transchel |publisher=[[Global Post]] |date=January 18, 2010 |accessdate=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a national ban on sales of all types of alcoholic beverages from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. was introduced to complement regional bans &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/34607933/Effects_of_Specific_Alcohol_Control_Policy_Measures_on_Alcohol-Related_Mortality_in_Russia_from_1998_to_2013 Khaltourina, Daria, and Andrey Korotayev.

In recent years, alcohol related deaths in Russia have dropped dramatically year over year falling to 6,789 in 2017 from 28,386 in 2006 and continuing to decline into 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fedstat.ru/indicator/33559?#&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic===
{{See also|Demographics of Russia}}

A study by Russian, British and French researchers published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' scrutinized deaths between 1990 and 2001 of residents of three [[Siberia]]n industrial towns with typical mortality rates and determined that 52% of deaths of people between the ages of 15 and 54 were the result of alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name=Lancet&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61034-5 |last1=Zaridze |first1=David |year=2009 |title=Alcohol and cause-specific mortality in Russia: a retrospective case—control study of 48 557 adult deaths |journal=The Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9682 |pages=2201–2214 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2809%2961034-5/abstract |last2=Brennan |first2=Paul |last3=Boreham |first3=Jillian |last4=Boroda |first4=Alex |last5=Karpov |first5=Rostislav |last6=Lazarev |first6=Alexander |last7=Konobeevskaya |first7=Irina |last8=Igitov |first8=Vladimir |last9=Terechova |first9=Tatiana|displayauthors=8 |pmid=19560602 |pmc=2715218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead researcher Professor David Zaridze estimated that the increase in alcohol consumption since 1987 has caused an additional three million deaths nationwide.&lt;ref name=Lancet/&gt;

In 2007, Gennadi Onishenko, the country's chief public health official, voiced his concern over the nearly threefold rise in alcohol consumption over the past 16 years; one in eight deaths was attributed to alcohol-related diseases, playing a major role in Russia's population decline.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news |title=Health alert as Russia’s alcohol consumption triples |author =Tony Halpin |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=April 13, 2007 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article1647475.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men are particularly hit hard: according to a U.N. National Human Development Report, Russian males born in 2006 had a life expectancy of just over 60 years, or 17 years fewer than western Europeans, while Russian females could expect to live 13 years longer than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31544292/ |title=Alcohol blamed for half of ’90s Russian deaths |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, the [[Public Chamber of Russia]] reported over 500,000 alcohol-related deaths annually, noting that Russians consume about {{convert|18|l}} of spirits a year, more than double the {{convert|8|l}} that [[World Health Organization]] experts consider dangerous.&lt;ref name=RIA2&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia's alcohol consumption more than 100% above critical level |newspaper=RIA Novosti |date=September 24, 2009 |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090924/156238102.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
In 1985, at the time of Gorbachev's campaign to reduce drinking, it was estimated that alcoholism resulted in $8 billion in lost production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960191,00.html |title=Soviet Union Fighting the Battle of the Bottle |author1=John Moody |author2=James O.

===Social===

{{Further|Crime in Russia|Domestic violence in Russia}}

In the early 1980s, an estimated "two-thirds of murders and violent crimes were committed by intoxicated persons; and drunk drivers were responsible for 14,000 traffic deaths and 60,000 serious traffic injuries".&lt;ref name=Dorman/&gt; In 1995, about three quarters of those arrested for homicide were under the influence of alcohol, and 29% of respondents reported that children beaten within families were the victims of drunks and alcoholics.&lt;ref name="WHO-EU"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/98804/E88757.pdf | title=Interpersonal Violence and Alcohol in the Russian Federation | publisher=Violence and Injury Prevention Programme - WHO Regional Office for Europe | date=2006 | accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1997 report published in the ''[[Journal of Family Violence]]'' found that among male perpetrators of spousal homicide, 60–75% of offenders had been drinking prior to the incident.&lt;ref name="WHO-EU" /&gt;

==== Suicide ====
{{Further|Suicide in Russia}}

In 2008, [[suicide]] claimed 38,406 lives in Russia.&lt;ref name="gks2009"&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b09_00/IssWWW.exe/Stg/d07/8-0.htm H1 2009 demographic figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218100517/http://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b09_00/IssWWW.exe/Stg/d07/8-0.htm |date=2012-02-18 }} [[Goskomstat|Rosstat]] Retrieved on August 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; With a rate of 27.1 suicides per 100,000 people, Russia has one of the highest [[List of countries by suicide rate|suicide rates]] in the world, although it has been steadily decreasing since it peaked at around 40 per 100,000 in the mid-late 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/russ.pdf WHO Russia suicide statistics] [[WHO]] retrieved on March 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; including a 30% drop from 2001 to 2006.

Heavy alcohol use is a significant factor in the suicide rate, with an estimated half of all suicides a result of alcohol abuse. This is evident by the fact that Russia's suicide rate since the mid-90s has declined alongside per capita alcohol consumption, despite the economic crises since then; alcohol consumption is more of a factor than economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2010/0427/analit05.php Demoscope - Demographic, social and economic consequences of alcohol abuse in Russia] [[Demoscope]] Retrieved on July 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Prophylactoriums, medical treatment centres, were established in 1925 to treat alcoholics and prostitutes. By 1929 there were five in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khwaja|first1=Barbara|title=Health Reform in Revolutionary Russia|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/2017/05/26/health-reform-revolutionary-russia/|accessdate=26 May 2017|publisher=Socialist Health Association|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chronic alcoholics evading treatment were detained for up to two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jargin|first1=Sergei|title=Learning from the Russians|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/333/7561/267.1/rr/700222|accessdate=29 May 2017|publisher=British Medical Journal|date=27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s and 1940s until the mid-1980s, the main treatment for alcoholism in Russia was [[conditioned response therapy]]. This treatment has since fallen out of favour, and the modern mainstream treatment has become [[pharmacotherapy]], which involves detailed analyses of each patient, medicinal treatment, [[psychotherapy]], [[sociotherapy]], and other support.&lt;ref name="CoEP2010"&gt;{{cite book | title = Treatment systems overview | publisher = Council of Europe Publishing | location = Strasbourg | year = 2010 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v0ZCt60i3M8C&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = June 14, 2011 | pages = 127–128 | isbn = 978-92-871-6930-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] exists in Russia, it lacks support from the government and so is generally dismissed by the Russian population.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

One [[alternative medicine|alternative therapy]] for alcoholism that has been used in Russia is the practice of "[[Coding (therapy)|coding]]", in which therapists pretend to insert a "code" into patients' brains with the ostensible effect that drinking even small amounts of alcohol will be extremely harmful or even lethal. Despite not being recommended in Russian clinical guidelines, it has enjoyed considerable popularity. In recent years its use has lessened, due to the spread of information about its ineffectiveness.&lt;ref name="Mosher2007"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mosher | first = Clayton | title = Drugs and Drug Policy | publisher = Sage | location = Thousand Oaks | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-7619-3007-5 | page = 269 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aDMvoMxx0-IC&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finn2005"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/01/AR2005100101196.html | title=Russia's 1-Step Program: Scaring Alcoholics Dry | publisher=[[Washington Post]] | date=October 2, 2005 | accessdate=June 9, 2011 | author=Finn, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

	'''Aristides Agramonte y Simoni''' (June 3, 1868 in [[Camagüey]], [[Cuba]] &amp;ndash; August 19, 1931 in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States]]) was a [[Cuban American]] physician, pathologist and bacteriologist with expertise in [[tropical medicine]].  In 1898 [[George Miller Sternberg]] appointed him as an Acting Assistant Surgeon in the U.S. Army and sent him to Cuba to study a yellow fever outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/yellowfever/commission/ |title=Yellow Fever &amp; and the Reed Collection: The Walter Reed Yellow Fever Commission in Cuba |publisher=University of Virginia Health Sciences Library |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827055540/http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/yellowfever/commission/ |archivedate=2014-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later served on the [[Yellow Fever Commission]], a U.S. Army Commission led by [[Walter Reed]] which examined the transmission of [[yellow fever]].  In addition to this research, he also studied plague, dengue, trachoma, malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid fever and more. After serving on the Yellow Fever Commission, he served as a professor at the [[University of Havana]] as well as many government positions.

'''Blood donation in Bangladesh''' is an activity conducted by several different organisations. As of 2011, about 25% of the nation's blood supply came from voluntary donation, 20–25% from paid donors, and 50–55% from one-time donation for a specific patient.

==Background==
[[Blood transfusion]] service became available in [[Bangladesh]] at the [[Dhaka Medical College and Hospital|Dhaka Medical College Hospital]] in 1950.&lt;ref name=MBI&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Islam | first1 = M. B. | title = Blood transfusion services in Bangladesh | doi = 10.4103/0973-6247.53880 | journal = Asian Journal of Transfusion Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 108–110 | year = 2009 | pmid =  20808657| pmc =2920470 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional blood donors were the mainstay of blood donation in Bangladesh, with 47% of donated blood coming from professional donors as late as the year 2000.&lt;ref name=MBI/&gt; The potential for contamination in the supply, and the need for volunteer donors was well recognised.&lt;ref name=MBI/&gt; An estimate from 2011 is that of the 500,000 units of blood required annually, only 25% come from voluntary donation, 20–25% from paid donors, and 50–55% from one-time donation for a specific patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nurul Islam Hasib |date=14 June 2011 |title=Let Bangladeshi youth's blood 'flow' |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2011/06/14/speciallet-bangladeshi-youth-s-blood-flow |newspaper=bd24news.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SANDHANI==
{{Main|Sandhani}}
The first  volunteer blood donation program in Bangladesh was begun in 1977 at [[Dhaka Medical College]], and was organized by [[SANDHANI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandhani.org/about-us/history/ |title=Sandhani, official web site, history}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
SANDHANI has now 24 units in different medical and dental colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandhani.org/contact-us/ |title=Sandhani, official web site, contacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;
SANDHANI is a voluntary institution run by the medical and dental students of BANGLADESH. It is mainly working on motivation on voluntary blood donation and posthumous eye donation in Bangladesh.
SANDHANI is also working for the helpless patient in the community by serving them with drug from the drug bank, donating blood to the thalassaemia patient, giving relief to the flooded and disaster affected people etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandhani.org/home/ |title=Sandhani, official web site, home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine Club==
{{Main|Medicine Club}}
Medicine Club is also a Non-profit Humanitarian Organization in Bangladesh volunteered by Medical &amp; Dental students&lt;ref&gt;http://medicineclub-bd.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;. The organization was founded on January 31, 1981 at [[Mymensingh Medical College]]&lt;ref&gt;http://medicineclub-bd.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; with the intention of helping the helpless and serving humanity. Now it has 21 Units in different Medical &amp; dental colleges.&lt;ref&gt;http://medicineclub-bd.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; It has since broadened its scope to include voluntary blood donating, prevent Thalassaemia &lt;ref&gt;http://medicineclub-bd.org/thalassaemia/&lt;/ref&gt; throughout Bangladesh &amp; rise awareness about this. It contributes a large amount of donated blood throughout Bangladesh&lt;ref&gt;http://medicineclub-bd.org/blood-division/&lt;/ref&gt;. It also helps poor patients by donating money and drugs&lt;ref&gt;http://medicineclub-bd.org/drug-division/&lt;/ref&gt;. This organization also distributes vaccines&lt;ref&gt;http://medicineclub-bd.org/vaccination-division/&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; warm cloths&lt;ref&gt;http://medicineclub-bd.org/warm-clothes-distribution/&lt;/ref&gt; and arranges "Health Check Up Campaigns"&lt;ref&gt;http://medicineclub-bd.org/health-check-up/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Red Crescent Society==
{{Main|Bangladesh Red Crescent Society}}
The [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] began a blood program in Bangladesh in 1981.&lt;ref name=RC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdrcs.org/programs-and-projects/blood |title=Bangladesh Red Crescent Society: Blood Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today they operate several centres, using both whole blood and fractionated blood components.&lt;ref name=RC/&gt;

==Badhan==
A 1997 survey of students at the [[University of Dhaka]] had found a generally favourable attitude towards voluntary blood donation, and an overwhelmingly unfavourable attitude to paid blood donation, and recommended that a campaign should be started immediately to increase awareness and participation in voluntary blood donation among the student population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hosain, G.M.M. |author2=Anisuzzaman, M. |author3=Begum, A. |year=1997|title=Knowledge and attitude towards voluntary blood donation among Dhaka University students in Bangladesh|journal=East African Medical Journal|volume=74|issue=9|pages=549–553|pmid=9487428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Badhan is a non-political voluntary [[blood donation|blood donors']] organisation in Bangladesh that was established in 1997.&lt;ref name=badhan&gt;{{cite news |author=Mahmud-Ur-Rashid |date=1 February 2007 |title=Campus Spotlight: Badhan |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2007/02/01/camspotlight_BADHAN.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badhan's first activity was a free blood-group testing program that took place on 24 October 1997 at [[Shahidullah Hall]] of the University of Dhaka.&lt;ref name=badhan/&gt; Shahidullah Hall is very close to Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, and before that time people needing blood for patients would gather regularly in or near the hall gate, seeking help.&lt;ref name=badhan/&gt; Mohammad Shahidul Islam Ripon was the principal originator of the program, along with other students.&lt;ref name=website/&gt;

The blood provided is fresh rather than stored,&lt;ref name=website&gt;{{cite web |url=http://badhan.org |title=BADHAN (A Voluntary Blood Donor's Organization): Official Web Site |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a database of people whose blood type has been previously established. The graduate- and postgraduate-level students of Bangladeshi universities and postgraduate colleges are the main participants of the organisation.&lt;ref name=badhan/&gt; The organisation is active in 14 universities and 29 university colleges.&lt;ref name=website/&gt;

Other activities include raising awareness about donating fresh blood, donating blood voluntarily for patients and helping poor people in time of natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.du.ac.bd/main_menu/co_curricular |title=Co-curricular activities |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160210131500/http://www.du.ac.bd/main_menu/co_curricular |archivedate=10 February 2016 |accessdate=10 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financing comes primarily from individual members and ex-members, as well as from the universities and colleges administration, from donations.&lt;ref name=website/&gt; The California non-profit organisation SpaandanB has been a significant contributor from outside Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaandanb.org/projects/badhan/badhan1.html#3|title=SpaandanB project: Badhan Blood Transfusion Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Badhan wants to make blood donation as a social movement. It's ultimate goals are (a) none should die from lack of blood, (b) every person knows his/her blood group. Head office of Badhan is located at ground floor of TSC, Dhaka University.

==Bangladesh Blood Services==
{{Main|Bangladesh Blood Services}}
The Bangladesh Blood Services is organized volunteer blood donation program in [[Bangladesh]] was begun in 2017.&lt;ref name=BBS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbs.indobangla24.com |title=Bangladesh Blood Services: ABOUT BBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh Blood Services operates [[Bangladesh|Bangladesh]]’s blood supply in a manner that gains the trust, commitment and confidence of all [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi]] by providing a safe, secure, cost-effective, affordable and accessible supply of quality blood, blood products and their alternatives.

The '''Center for Medical Progress''' ('''CMP''') is an [[anti-abortion]] organization &lt;!-- Described this way by Reuters, Associated Press and FoxNews.com - see talk before changing--&gt; founded by [[David Daleiden]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/12/17/misinformer-of-the-year-the-center-for-medical/207506|title=Misinformer Of The Year: The Center For Medical Progress|date=December 15, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/07/15/live_action_distributed_the_planned_parenthood_sting_video_why_aren_t_they.html|title=What Is the Center for Medical Progress, the Group Behind the Latest Viral Abortion Video?|first=Amanda|last=Marcotte|date=July 15, 2015|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt23jul/&gt;&lt;ref name=yahoohealthjul/&gt;&lt;ref name=opresc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/21/planned-parenthood-official-jokes-about-buying-lamborghini-with-fetus-tissue-profits.html|title=Hoaxers Fail to Nail Planned Parenthood in New Video|work=The Daily Beast|quote=Operation Rescue provides “advice, consulting, funds” to the CMP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nation/&gt; The CMP is best known for producing undercover recordings that prompted [[Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy|a controversy over Planned Parenthood in 2015]]; CMP established a fake company to pose as buyers of fetal tissue and secretly recording Planned Parenthood officials during meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/22/425314909/sting-videos-part-of-longtime-campaign-against-planned-parenthood|title=Sting Videos Part Of Longtime Campaign Against Planned Parenthood|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/meet-the-millennial-who-infiltrated-the-guarded-world-of-abortion-providers/2015/10/14/25aaf862-678b-11e5-9223-70cb36460919_story.html|title=Meet the millennial who infiltrated the guarded world of abortion providers|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CMP released edited videos of the discussions which made it appear as if Planned Parenthood intended to profit from fetal tissue, although the full unedited videos instead showed that Planned Parenthood requested only a fee to cover costs without any profit.&lt;ref name="factcheck"/&gt; A [[grand jury]] in [[Harris County, Texas]] took no action against Planned Parenthood, but instead indicted Daleiden and a second CMP employee on felony charges of tampering with governmental records and attempting to purchase human organs.&lt;ref name="indicted"/&gt; The charges were dropped six months later, but in March 2017 Daleiden and the second CMP employee were charged with 15 felonies in California&amp;mdash;one for each of the people whom they had filmed without consent, and one for [[criminal conspiracy]] to invade privacy.

The videos led conservative politicians to request a criminal investigation of [[Planned Parenthood]] for selling fetal tissue, and in December 2017 the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] revealed that it was investigating Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/07/planned-parenthood-under-investigation-by-justice-department-over-sale-fetal-tissue.html|title=Planned Parenthood under investigation by Justice Department over sale of fetal tissue|date=December 7, 2017|publisher=[[Fox News]]|first=Brooke|last=Singman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
[[David Daleiden]] formed the Center for Medical Progress in 2013 after working for [[Live Action (organization)|Live Action]] for five years. He was that organization’s director of research "during the early stages" of the project to make secret recordings of [[Planned Parenthood]] clinics.&lt;ref name=maker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/15/who-made-the-planned-parenthood-video.html|title=Maker of Planned Parenthood Video Called Abortion 'Genocide'|work=The Daily Beast|date=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=more&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/planned-parenthood-sting-video_55ad3b63e4b0caf721b3633d|title=Planned Parenthood: More Sting Videos Are Coming|work=The Huffington Post|quote=The CMP was founded by David Daleiden, an anti-abortion activist who previously worked for the group Live Action, known for its heavily edited undercover videos of Planned Parenthood staffers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMP's board members include Daleiden, [[Troy Newman (activist)|Troy Newman]], and [[Albin Rhomberg]],&lt;ref name=nation/&gt; and they receive advice, consulting and funds from [[Operation Rescue (Kansas)|Operation Rescue]].&lt;ref name=nail/&gt; Their website initially described the organization as "dedicated to informing and educating both the lay public and the scientific community about the latest advances in regenerative medicine, cell-based therapies, and related disciplines."&lt;ref name=nyt23jul/&gt; It was initially  registered by Daleiden as a tax-exempt biomedicine charity,&lt;ref name=sting&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/planned-parenthood-sting-video_55a92205e4b0896514d11ac9|title=Group Behind Planned Parenthood Sting Video May Have Tricked IRS, Donors|date=July 17, 2015|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after questions about the group's tax exempt status the organization's stated mission was changed to "a group of citizen journalists dedicated to monitoring and reporting on medical ethics and advances."&lt;ref name=nyt23jul/&gt;

==Undercover videos controversy==
{{main|Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy}}

Daleiden's organization set up a fake biomedical research company, called Biomax Procurement Services. Under this guise, they posed as potential buyers of aborted fetal tissue and organs, and secretly recorded [[Planned Parenthood]] officials during meetings.&lt;ref name=cover&gt;{{cite web|title=Sting Videos Part Of Longtime Campaign Against Planned Parenthood|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/22/425314909/sting-videos-part-of-longtime-campaign-against-planned-parenthood|publisher=NPR.org|accessdate=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; CMP released edited versions of these videos, which it promoted as showing Planned Parenthood officials "price haggling over ‘baby parts'".&lt;ref name=second/&gt; When the full, unedited, videos became available, they instead showed "a Planned Parenthood executive repeatedly saying its clinics want to cover their costs, not make money, when donating fetal tissue from abortions for scientific research."&lt;ref name="factcheck"/&gt; According to the lawyer for Planned Parenthood, Roger K. Evans, Biomax proposed “sham procurement contracts,” offering {{USD}}1,600 for liver and thymus fetal tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Planned Parenthood Tells Congress More Videos of Clinics Might Surface|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/us/planned-parenthood-tells-congress-more-videos-of-clinics-might-surface.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The videos and allegations attracted widespread media coverage, and re-invigorated the long-term American political [[abortion rights|abortion debate]].&lt;ref name=NYT4&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/07/20/us/politics/ap-us-congress-planned-parenthood.html|title=Planned Parenthood Says Video Part of Decadelong Harassment|work=The New York Times|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=August 7, 2015|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five separate [[United States Congress|congressional]] investigations of Planned Parenthood were launched as a result of the videos.&lt;ref&gt;Molly Redden, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/25/planned-parenthood-grand-jury-indicts-anti-abortion-activists Grand jury investigating Planned Parenthood indicts anti-abortion activists instead], ''The Guardian'' (January 25, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; A bill to defund Planned Parenthood was proposed, but failed to pass in the Senate on August 3, 2015.&lt;ref name=reuters08032015&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/03/us-usa-plannedparenthood-idUSKCN0Q80DL20150803 "Senate blocks Planned Parenthood defunding measure"], Reuters, August 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Several states cut contracts and funding for Planned Parenthood following the videos, regardless of whether Planned Parenthood provided abortion services in those states.&lt;ref name="nyt-la"&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|date=September 1, 2015|title=Louisiana Lays Bare Difficulty in Push to Cut Planned Parenthood Funding|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/us/politics/louisiana-lays-bare-difficulty-in-push-to-cut-planned-parenthood-funding.html|first=Jackie|last=Calmes}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' was highly critical of the Center for Medical Progress, describing the videos as part of a "campaign of misinformation" by an organization that "twist(s) the facts."&lt;ref name="nejm"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Topulos GP, Greene MF, Drazen JM|title=Planned Parenthood at Risk|journal=N.

[[TeleSUR]] television network listed The Center for Medical Progress as one of "The 7 Biggest Bigots of 2015" for "attacking women's rights in the United States."&lt;ref name=Mallett-Outtrim &gt;{{citation |last= Mallett-Outtrim |first=Ryan |date=December 17, 2015 |title= The 7 Biggest Bigots of 2015 |publisher= [[TeleSUR]] |url= http://www.telesurtv.net/english/analysis/The-7-Biggest-Bigots-of-2015-20151217-0043.html |accessdate= December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Media Matters for America]] named The Center for Medical Progress their "Misinformer Of The Year" for 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Misinformer Of The Year: The Center For Medical Progress|accessdate=April 11, 2016|last=Kittel|first=Olivia|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/12/17/misinformer-of-the-year-the-center-for-medical/207506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil lawsuits against the CMP===
In the aftermath of the videos being released, the [[National Abortion Federation]] sued the Center for Medical Progress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2015/07/31/national-abortion-federation-files-lawsuit-planned-parenthood-attack-group/ National Abortion Federation Files Lawsuit Against Planned Parenthood Attack Group], RH Reality Check, July 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/planned-parenthood-lawsuit-legal-threat-364833 Planned Parenthood Weighs Response to Undercover Videos], ''[[Newsweek]]'', August 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, two courts ruled that Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress must turn over private documents and submit to depositions about how they orchestrated their video sting, and could require Daleiden to turn over paperwork and details of the operation, and provide the full raw footage he collected while posing as an executive of the fictitious tissue procurement firm Biomax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Courts rule Daleiden must turn over documents, video footage|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/david-daleiden-center-for-medical-progress-planned-parenthood-video-213992|publisher=[[Politico]]|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 4, 2015, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy denied an emergency appeal from the Center for Medical Progress to block the lower courts' order that would require CMP to release the names of its donors.&lt;ref name="Newsweek_12_5_2015"&gt;{{cite web|author=Martinez, J.|date=December 5, 2015|title=Supreme Court Weighing In on Planned Parenthood Videos|url=http://www.newsweek.com/supreme-court-planned-parenthood-videos-401597|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2016, Planned Parenthood commenced a lawsuit in [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|federal district court in San Francisco]] against the CMP, alleging that the group and its members, in setting up a fake tissue procurement company and using fake identities to set up private meetings engaged in [[wire fraud|wire]] and [[mail fraud]] in violation of the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO Act), unlawfully [[invasion of privacy|invaded privacy]], and engaged in illegal secret recording, and [[trespassing]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Frates, [http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/14/politics/planned-parenthood-lawsuit-center-for-medical-progress/ Planned Parenthood files suit against anti-abortion videos group], CNN (January 15, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Pemberton, [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/01/pp-files-lawsuit-over-secretly-filmed-videos.html Planned Parenthood Files Lawsuit Over Secretly Filmed Videos], ''Daily Intelligencer'' (January 14, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal proceedings===
On January 25, 2016, the findings of a [[Harris County, Texas]], [[grand jury]] investigating the affair were made public. The grand jury cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing, and indicted two CMP employees. David Daleiden was indicted on one felony charge of tampering with a governmental record by making a fake driver's license and one [[misdemeanor]] count related to purchasing human organs; another center employee, Sandra Merritt, was indicted on one charge of tampering with a governmental record.&lt;ref name="indicted"&gt;{{cite news|first=Manny|last=Fernandez|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/26/us/2-abortion-foes-behind-planned-parenthood-videos-are-indicted.html|title=2 Abortion Foes Behind Planned Parenthood Videos Are Indicted|work=New York Times|date=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas charges against Daleiden and Merritt, however, were eventually dropped due to questions surrounding the authority of the grand jury to indict Daleiden and Merritt, due to the extension of the grand jury's term, with District Attorney Devon Anderson stating "The grand jury took the investigation where the facts led it; however, Texas law limits what can be investigated after a grand jury extension order is issued. In light of this and after careful research and review, this office dismissed the indictments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/last-charges-dropped-against-abortion-opponents-in-planned-parenthood-case.html|title=Last Charges Dropped Against Abortion Foes in Making of Planned Parenthood Video|first=Manny|last=Fernandez|date=July 26, 2016|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/last-charges-against-duo-in-planned-parenthood-video-sting-are-dropped/2016/07/26/ff0792f6-5352-11e6-bbf5-957ad17b4385_story.html|title=Last charges against duo in Planned Parenthood video sting are dropped|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2016, a Texas judge dismissed the misdemeanor charge of purchase and sale of human organs due to a technicality in the Harris County prosecutor's indictment. The next day, the Harris County District Attorney's Office said it would not fight the decision. The prosecution failed to provide proof that any fees offered or paid for aborted fetal parts were not covered by exceptions like physician or transport fees. The hearing for the felony charge was July 26, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Chiaramonte, [http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/06/14/key-charge-dropped-against-pro-life-activist-in-planned-parenthood-sting.html Key Charge Dropped Against Pro Life Activist in Planned Parenthood Sting], FOX News (June 14, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2017, Daleiden and Merritt were charged with 15 felonies in the State of California - one for each of the people whom they had filmed without consent, and one for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalton|first1=Andrew|title=Undercover videos of fetal tissue talks spur felony charges|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/undercover-videos-of-fetal-tissue-talks-spur-felony-charges-1.13281156|work=Times Colonist|agency=AP|date=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the felony charges include fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-planned-parenthood-charges-activists-20170328-story.html|title=Two antiabortion activists behind undercover Planned Parenthood videos charged with 15 felonies|first=Matt|last=Hamilton|date=March 28, 2017|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daleiden's attorney, Steve Cooley, has sought the dismissal of all charges, based on the fact that the accusers are not named in the indictment, which would prevent Daleiden and Merritt from confronting their accusers, in violation of their [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-plannedparenthood-california-idUSKBN1800AW|title=Anti-abortion activists seek dismissal of California privacy case|date=May 4, 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2017, fourteen of the charges were dismissed, with leave to amend, on the grounds that they were legally insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Egelko|first1=Bob|title=SF judge deals setback to prosecutors in abortion sting videos|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-judge-deals-setback-to-prosecutors-in-abortion-11237776.php|accessdate=22 June 2017|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Leave to amend" means that the prosecutors were allowed the option to re-file the charges with more details; the prosecutors did so some time during the week of July 3, and all fifteen felony charges against Daleiden and Merritt are active again.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/California-files-more-charges-against-11271723.php#photo-13200872&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50893">'''Community integration''', while diversely defined, is a term encompassing the full participation of all people in [[community]] life. It has specifically referred to the integration of people with [[disabilities]] into US society&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). Integration. "Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support for All". (pp.8-9). London: Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Racino, J. &amp; Shoultz, B. (1988)."From Being in the Community to Being Part of the Community: The Proceedings of a Leadership Institute on Developmental Disabilities." Washington, DC: Syracuse University, Center on Human Policy, Institute on Community Integration.&lt;/ref&gt; from the local to the national level and for decades was a defining agenda in countries such as Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Towell, D. &amp; Beardshaw, V. (1991). "Enabling Community Integration: The Role of Public Authorities in Promoting an Ordinary Life for People with Learning Disabilities in the 1990s." London, Great Britain: The King's Fund.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the Consortium of Citizens for Disabilities&lt;ref&gt;Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities.(2012). Washington, DC. Retrieved from:[http://www.c-c-d.org]&lt;/ref&gt; advocates for a national public policy which "ensures the self-determination, independence, empowerment, integration and inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all parts of society". Other countries (such as Canada) with different roots often spoke of inclusion: the unifying, global agenda in "disability and community life".&lt;ref&gt;[[Inclusion International]]. (2011, June). Priorities for people with intellectual disabilities in implementing the UN Convention on the rights of people with disabilities: The road ahead. "The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities", Living in the community,Article 19. London, UK: Inclusion International&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps]]. (2011). "About Us: Equity, Opportunity and Inclusion." Seattle, WA: Author&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Theorists have differentiated types and levels of integration in special education as physical, functional, social, [[community]] and organizational.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson,D., Ferguson,P. &amp; Bogdan, R. (1987). If mainstreaming is the answer, what is the question? In: V. Richardson-Koehler (Ed.), "Educator's Handbook: A Research Perspective" (pp. 394-419). New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; In disability circles, community integration meant opportunities for participation in schools, careers, homes, relationships, leisure, and a variety of interests and lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. &amp; Racino, J. (1991). Community living: Lessons for today.  In: L. Meyer, C. Peck, &amp; L. Brown (Eds.), "Critical Issues in the Lives of People with Severe Disabilities." (pp. 235-238). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Bengt Nirje and the late Wolf Wolfensberger of the US are internationally known for their concept of [[normalization (sociology)|normalization]] and [[social role valorization]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1983). Social role valorization: A proposed new term for the principle of normalization. "Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities", 21(6), 234-239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nirje, B. (1985). The basis and logic of the normalization principle. "Australia and New Zealand Journal of Developmental Disabilities", 11(2), 65-68.&lt;/ref&gt; with a particular emphasis on physical and social integration. Anders Gustavsson (ca. 1990) of Sweden has indicated that physical integration best describes the common use of the term "integration", with social integration the struggle for "equality and quality in life."&lt;ref&gt;Gustavsson, A. (ca. 1990). "Difficulties and Opportunities for People with Disabilities Living in an Integrated Society". Stockholm, Sweden: Stockholm College of Health and Caring Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intent of community integration was the participation of people with disabilities in regular environments, the antithesis of exclusionary practices (such as the minority-group model).&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, S., Biklen, D. &amp; Knoll, J. (1987). "Community Integration for Persons with Severe Disabilities." New York, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Racino_a"&gt;Racino, J. (1999a). "Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support for All."  London: The Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As the field moved toward community support, theories related to community living began to require applicability beyond a minority-group model&lt;ref name="Racino"&gt;Racino, J. (2000). "Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support." Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; with a new emphasis on self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;Abery, B., Mithaug, D., Stancliffe, R., &amp; Wehmeyer, M. (2003). "Theory in Self-Determination: Foundations for Educational Practice." Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by Racino, these theories include ecological theory, community-support theories, systems theory, feminist theories, family theories, sociocultural theories, critical theories in education, psychosocial theories, the generic human-concept theory and universal theories.&lt;ref name="Racino" /&gt;

==Systems change==
Taylor, in his analysis of community systems in the US, proposed the principle of non-restrictive environment as a counterpoint to the federal government's least-restrictive-environment principle.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J., Racino, J.A., Knoll, J.A. &amp; Lutfiyya, Z.M. (1987). "The Nonrestrictive Environment: On Community Integration of Persons with the Most Severe Disabilities." Syracuse, NY: Human Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. (1988). Caught in the continuum: A critical analysis of the least restrictive environment. "Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps", 13(1), 45-53.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the governing principle in the US is that of the most integrated setting based upon the Supreme Court Olmstead Decision.&lt;ref&gt;Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities. (2012). "Olmstead Implementation and the Concept of the Most Integrated Setting". Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Olmstead decision, the Supreme Court addressed the community integration issues multiple times in the case, Halderman v. Pennhurst State School and Hospital, a class action filed in Pennsylvania by attorney David Ferleger.&lt;ref&gt;Ferleger, D. and Boyd, P., Rights and Dignity: The Supreme Court, Congress and People With Disabilities After Pennhurst, 5 W.New Eng.L.Rev. 327 (1983) (co-author); Anti-Institutionalization and the Supreme Court, 14 Rutgers L.Rev. 595 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the Olmstead decision explicitly did not reach the constitutional issues decided in the Pennhurst and other cases, limitations in Olmstead have been critiqued and  it has been argued that there is a constitutional right to community services.&lt;ref&gt;Ferleger, The Constitutional Right to Community Services, 26 Georgia State University Law Rev. 763 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of large-scale systems change in community integration has involved challenges by local public agencies, key elements of these strategies (e.g., enabling leadership, putting people first, values and vision, learning for quality) and its implications for national policy.&lt;ref&gt;Towell, D. &amp; Beardshaw, V. (1991, Great Britain). "Enabling Community Integration: The Role of Public Authorities in Promoting an Ordinary Life for People with Learning Disabilities in the 1990s." London, Great Britain: The King's Fund.&lt;/ref&gt; Disability-agency, state-level disability-system, community and societal change are essential (but insufficient) elements of the process and outcomes of community integration.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1994, USA). Creating change in states, agencies and [[communities]]. In: Bradley, V. Ashbaugh,J.W. &amp; Blaney , B.C.(Eds.), "Creating Individual Supports for People with Developmental Disabilities: A Mandate for Change on Many Levels." (pp. 171-196). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Community integration also has strong community roots which places it in community practice fields from community psychology, to sociologists studying community, to inclusive education in local school systems, competitive businesses (with rehabilitation), rural independent living, urban sociology, local parks and recreation programs, community development and housing, [[neighbourhoods]] and communities, among others. 

===Education===
Educational integration has a long history of debate described as "more comprehensive than academic mainstreaming."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Biklen, D., Lehr, S.&amp; Searl, S. (1987). "Purposeful Integration...Inherently Equal." Syracuse, NY: Center on Human Policy for the Technical Assistance for Parent Programs.&lt;/ref&gt; Community integration in this context (schools) refers to opportunities "to learn practical social and community living skills (and job training) in a wide variety of community settings" (p.&amp;nbsp;13).&lt;ref&gt;Ford, A., Schnorr, R., Meyer, L., Davern, L., Black, J., &amp; Dempsey, P. (1989). "The Syracuse community-referenced curriculum guide for students with moderate and severe disabilities." Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Based in part on the civil-rights movement&lt;ref&gt;Heller, K. (1989). The return to community. (pp. 8-9). ''American Journal of Community Psychology'', 17(1): 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; as represented by Brown v. Board of Education, school integration was based on the right to a free, appropriate education in regular schools and classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Berrigan, C. (1984). All students belong in the classroom: Johnson City Schools, Johnson, New York. In: Duncan, J. (Eds.)(1990). "Materials on Integrated Education." Syracuse, NY: Center on Human Policy, Rehabilitation Research and Training Center in Community Integration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray-Seegert,C.(1989). "Nasty Girls, Thugs and Humans Like Me: Social Relationships between Severely Disabled and Nondisabled Students in the US."  Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Educational integration (now often equated with inclusion) remains controversial in the US (although it is supported by law) due, in part, to special-education systems.&lt;ref&gt;Biklen, D. (1987). The integration question: Educational and residential placement issues. In: Cohen, D., Donnellan, A. &amp; Paul, R. (Eds.), "Handbook of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders." (pp. 653-667). New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell, A. &amp; Hardman, M. (1989). The desegregation of America's special schools: Strategies for change. "Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps", 14(1), 68-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biklen, D. (1992). "Schooling without Labels: Parents, Educators and Inclusive Educators". Philadelphia, PA: Temple University.&lt;/ref&gt; School integration also involves children with more significant disabilities, such as those with technology-assisted needs.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, P.  (1991). Where there is a way, there is not always a will: Technology, public policy, and the school integration of children who are technology-assisted. Children's Health Care, 20(2), 68-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Progress has been made in education at the post-secondary level (in almost all population groups) due, in part, to disability-services departments at colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A.P. (1994). Supported Education: Past, present and future. "Community Support Network News", 10(2), 1,9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weir, C., Fialka, J., Timmons, J. &amp; Nord, D. (2011, Winter/Autumn). Feature issue on post secondary education and students with intellectual, developmental and other disabilities. "IMPACT", 23(3), 1-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, instead of educational integration, the goal is for continued school reform through [[inclusion (education)]] and for education with accommodations as required by the law.

===Housing===
In the US disability field a major shift has occurred from group and facility-based models to homes with support services,&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J., Walker, P. O'Connor, S. &amp; Taylor, S. (1993). "Housing, Support and Community: Choices and Strategies for Adults with Disabilities." Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing a change from "home-like" housing to community homes, neighborhoods and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. &amp; O'Connor, S. (1994). "A home of our own": Homes, neighborhoods and personal connections. In: Hayden, M. &amp; Abery, B. (Eds.), Challenges for a Service System in Transition: Ensuring Quality Life Experiences for Persons with Developmental Disabilities". (pp.381-403). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. Bogdan, R. &amp; Racino, J. (1991). "Life in the community: Case Studies of Organizations Supporting People with Disabilities". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; The most-recent initiatives were in homeownership,&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, D. &amp; Klein, J. (2005), Homeownership for individuals with disabilities: Factors in mortgage decisions. "Journal of Disability Policy Studies", 15(4), 194-200.&lt;/ref&gt; an important form of community integration which also involves a feeling of ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Shoultz, B. (1989). ''Supporting Individuals within Their Families or in Homes of their Own: The CAP-MR/DD Program in Raleigh, North Carolina''. Syracuse, NY: Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Community Integration.&lt;/ref&gt; Housing integration builds on a long history of support for good quality, [[affordable housing]] which often include analyses of social exclusion which may concentrate on US protected classes.&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliffe, P. (1999). Housing inequality and 'race': some critical reflections on the concept of 'social exclusion'. "Ethnic and Racial Studies", 22(1): 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Housing integration is of great importance, in part, because of the history of residential segregation (usually by race and class) in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Massey, D.S. &amp; Denton, N. A. (1990). Hypersegregation in US metropolitan areas: Black and hispanic segregation along five dimensions. "Demography", 26(1): 373-391.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohe, W. &amp; Freeman, L. (2001). Assisted housing and residential segregation: The role of race and ethnicity in the siting of assisted housing developments. "Journal of the American Planning Association", 67(3), 279-292.&lt;/ref&gt; Residential segregation due to inequality and disparity continues to be studied in ethnic, social and economic frameworks, including the process of desegregation, gentrification and hypersegregation.&lt;ref&gt;Massey,D., Condran, G.A., &amp; Denton, M.A. (1987). The effect of residential segregation on black social and economic well-being, "Social Forces", 66, 29-56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J.L. (1998). "Desegregation in Boston &amp; Buffalo: The Influence of Local Leaders." Albany, NY: State University at Albany.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ley, D. (1993). Gentrification in recession: Social change in six Canadian inner cities, 1981-1986. "Urban Geography", 13(3): 230-256.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, redlining, as a bridge issue across lower and middle classes, affects housing and neighborhood integration from as early as the 1970s with germandering districts for community development funds more common in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom, R. A. (1979). The politics of the neighborhood movement. ''South Atlantic Urban Studies'', 4: 103-120.&lt;/ref&gt; A discussion of residential segregation in US and Europe and a "critique of the ideal of integration" can be found in ''Inclusion and Democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;Young, I.M. (2000). "Inclusion and Democracy". New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, mixed-income and scattered-site housing was reported in a case study of a housing association supporting people with disabilities in Madison, Wisconsin (the Madison Mutual Housing Association and Cooperative).&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1993). Madison Mutual Housing Association. In: Racino, J., Walker, P., O'Connor, S. &amp; Taylor, S. (1993). "Housing, Support and Community". (pp. 253-280). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the Prairie Housing Cooperative (as reported by David Wetherow) integrates persons with disabilities into the community via housing.&lt;ref&gt;Kappel, B. &amp; Wetherow, D. (1986). People caring about people. The Prairie Housing Cooperative. "Entourage", 1(4), 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt; An early review on nonprofit housing in the US and Canada, with increasing governmental funds in the US today, indicates that [[mixed-income housing]] &lt;ref&gt; US Department of Housing and Urban Development. (2013, Spring). Confronting concentrated poverty with a mixed income strategy. ''Evidence Matters''. Washington, DC: US HUD, Office of Policy Development and Research. &lt;/ref&gt; was used primarily in "troubled neighborhoods" with efforts to seek higher-income tenants to move into those neighborhoods as opposed to raising the entire group's living standards.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, P. &amp; Hulchanski, J.D. (1993). The role of nonprofit housing in Canada and the United States: some comparisons. ''Housing Policy Debate'', 4(1): 43-79.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the emphasis is on inclusive and sustainable housing,&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. &amp; Towell, D. (2009)/10). "Conversations about Sustainable and Inclusive Communities: An Invitation". London: Centre for Inclusive Futures"&lt;/ref&gt; while other groups support equitable and sustainable housing in the US (Policy Link). The status of housing and disability in America was reported by the National Council on Disability in the US,&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Disability. (2010). ''The State of Housing in America in the 21st Century: A Disability Perspective''. Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; and compared to Harvard University's report on the nation's housing.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. (2012). ''State of the Nation's Housing 2012''. Cambridge, MA: President and Fellows of Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2014). Housing, and disability: Toward inclusive, equitable and sustainable communities. ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US''. London: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recreation===
Being in the community has meant being part of activities and events on the local level in towns, cities and suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2000). "Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support". (pp. 215-216). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Recreational integration is a facet of inclusion and community access.&lt;ref&gt;Schleien, S. (1993). Access and inclusion to community leisure services. "Parks and Recreation", 28(4), 66-72.&lt;/ref&gt; School and recreation integration was promoted in the US and in countries such as Canada and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, S. (1994). "Making School and Integration Fun for Everyone: Places and Ways to Integrate". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pedlar, A. (1990). Deinstitutionalization and the role of therapeutic recreationists in social integration. "Journal of Applied  Recreation Research", 15(2): 101-115.&lt;/ref&gt; On the local level concerns have generally concerned acceptance and friendships, support services, site accessibility, group size and "truly integrated" (in contrast to "side-by-side") activities. For example, in Great Britain community opportunities were sought so people could belong, contribute and make friends.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. (1988).

===Employment===
Employment integration was advocated during the 1970s for women, people with disabilities and racial groups, who were seen as discriminated against in employment (Racino for the Urban League of Onondaga County, Inc., 1978); for example, occupations and professions were constructed based upon gender: women's professions (nurses, teachers, secretaries) and men's professions (scientists, managers, administrators, police, firemen and construction).&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, M. (1997). Feminizing paid work. "Current Sociology: Feminism in the 1990s", 45(2), 49-73&lt;/ref&gt; Progress has been made at the leadership level with the first African American president ([[Barack Obama]]), disability leadership in the [[United States Department of Education]] (Judith Heumann) and the rise of prominent women in the state department [[United States Department of State|State Department]] ([[Madeleine Albright]] and [[Hillary Clinton]]).

For those with severe disabilities employment-integration initiatives were often framed as [[supported employment]], which allowed jobs at regular businesses and employment sites.&lt;ref&gt;Wehman, P. &amp; Kregel, J. (1998). "More Than a Job: Securing Satisfying Careers for People with Disabilities." Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogan, P., Hagner, D., &amp; Murphy, S. (1993). Natural supports: Reconceptualizing job coach roles. "Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps", 18(4), 275-281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danley, K.S. &amp; Anthony, W. (1987).

"Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation", 9(2), 61-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hagner, D. &amp; DiLeo, D. (1993). ''Working Together: Workplace Culture, Supported Employment and Persons with Disabilities''. Cambridge, MA: Brookline Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar initiatives in the mental health field were often called transitional employment, and other forms of integration included competitive placements in businesses and industry, targeted positions, and even affirmative businesses in the hearts of business districts. A major success was the passage of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]], [[ADA Amendments Act of 2008|amended in 2008]] (following the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]], amended in 1978), which provided protection for men and women with disabilities in obtaining jobs, careers and positions with necessary workplace accommodations.&lt;ref&gt;Blanck, P. (2000). "Employment, Disability and the Americans with Disability Act: Issues in Law, Public Policy and Research." Chicago, IL: Northwestern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A key service for employment integration is often considered to be personal assistance services,&lt;ref&gt;Solovieva, T., Walsh, R.T., Hendricks, D.J. &amp; Dowlder, D. (2010). Workplace personal assistance services for people with disabilities: Making productive employment possible. ''Journal of Rehabilitation'', 76: 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; or in other fields a job coach&lt;ref&gt;Wehman, P. &amp; Kregel, J. (1985). A supported work approach to competitive employment of individuals with severe and moderate disabilities. ''Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 10: 3-11.&lt;/ref&gt; prior to more "natural" models of supervision and support.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, J. (1992). ''Natural Supports at School, Work, and in the Community''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context employment integration has been conceptualized, including social aspects of promotion, discriminatory hiring and termination practices, performance standards, job-sharing and modification, educational attainment, internships and volunteer experiences, workplace relationships, team-building, supervisory roles, [[workers' compensation]], accommodations and supports (Urban League of Onondaga County, 1978). Competitive employment integration at the US workplace is expected by law, and categorical services have tended to be developed as segregated bases (e.g., sheltered facilities to supported employment). Employment integration is a worldwide issue, modified by approaches to multicultural groups (e.g. the growing Latino population in the US), the changing economy (e.g. from manufacturing to service) and increasing unemployment.

==Policies==
Community integration has been most criticized for its inattention to gender, ethnic, cultural, racial, class and economic factors&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Bogdan, R. &amp; Racino, J. (1991). "Life in the Community: Case Studies of Organizations Supporting People with Disabilities. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Towell, D. &amp; Beardshaw, V. (1991). "Enabling Community Integration:. London, Great Britain: The King's Fund College."&lt;/ref&gt; ("double discrimination", pp.&amp;nbsp;60–61). At the university level multiculturalism, including disability, was proposed as the solution to these complex issues.&lt;ref&gt;Traustadottir, R., Lutfiyya, Z.M. &amp; Shoultz,B. (1994).

Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Community integration, in practice, involves diverse approaches and models (age, team, agency, area and gender integration or segregation) and has been integral to de-institutionalization and community development for over two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1991). Organizations in community living: Supporting people with disabilities." "Journal of Mental Health Administration", 18(1), 51-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2002).

===Cross-disability===
In the sub-field of brain injury, community integration included areas ranging from supported employment to daily living skills, family interventions (versus support) and memory training, school reintegration and transition to post secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;Kreutzer, J. &amp; Wehman, P.

In the field of mental health Paul Carling promoted community integration in the 1980s and 1990s in opposition to the predominant medical model,&lt;ref&gt;Carling, P. (1990). Community integration of people with psychiatric disabilities: Emerging trends. In: Jacobsen, J.W., Burchard, S., &amp; Carling, P.

Invited Address to the National Conference on Clinical Training Policy in Psychology at the University of Houston, Houston, Texas.  Burlington, VT:  Center for Change through Housing and Support, University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt;while psychiatric rehabilitation also linked to the medical, often allied health, professions. Carling's approach to community integration in mental health was congruent with intellectual disabilities, particularly in areas of community living (e.g., supportive living in intellectual disabilities, supported housing in mental health, and housing and support). &lt;ref&gt;Allard, M. (1996). Supported living policies and programs in the USA. In: J. Mansell &amp; K. Ericsson, ''Deinstitutionalisation and Community Living'' (pp. 98-116). London: Chapman &amp; Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, ''Disability and Society'', a popular disability policy journal discussed community reintegration for people with psychiatric disabilities and their relationship to centers for independent living. &lt;ref&gt; Mirza, M. et al. (2008). Community reintegration for people with psychiatric disabilities: Challenging systemic barriers to service provision and public policy through participatory action research. "Disability and Society", 23(4): 323-336.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive medical systems were proposed to support the family in community integration, including new roles for specialized personnel from neuropsychologists to physiatrists.&lt;ref&gt;Zasler, N.D. &amp; Kreutzer, J.S. (1991). Family and sexuality after traumatic brain injury. In: J.M. Williams &amp; T. Kay (Eds.), ''Head Injury: A Family Matter''. (pp. 253-270). Baltimore, MD: Paul H.

===US federal initiative===
In 1985, the US government funded a national community-integration project identifying best community practices for people with the "most severe disabilities".&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, J., Taylor, S., Racino, J., Good, A., Traustadottir, R., Searl, S., Meyer, I., Ford, A., Nisbet, J. &amp; Biklen, D.

"The Nonrestrictive Environment on Community Integration for Persons with the Most Severe Disabilities." Syracuse, NY: Human Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Technical assistance was funded through the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Community Integration (of the National Institute on Disability Rehabilitation Research and Training Center, US Department of Education) to all states.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999b). "Statewide approaches to community integration: Moving toward technical assistance strategies that make a difference.

NY, NY and London: Teachers College Press. &lt;/ref&gt;The Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Community Integration (Syracuse University, headed by Steve Taylor) also had subcontracts with the University of Illinois (David Braddock), the University of Minnesota Institute on Community Integration (K. Charlie Lakin)&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, M. F. &amp; Abery, B.H. (1994). ''Challenges for a Service System in Transition''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. &lt;/ref&gt; The federal departments subsequently offered contracts to evaluate the status of these new community services in the US.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation |last1=Doty |first1=Pamela |title=Cost-Effectiveness of Home and Community-Based Long-Term Care Services |date=June 2000 |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2000/costeff.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

The principles of community integration through the national flagship centers (the Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers on Family and Community Living,&lt;ref&gt;Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers on Family and Community Living. (1990). "Sharing the Vision...Meeting the Challenge." Washington, DC, Syracuse, NY &amp; Minneapolis, Minnesota: University of Minnesota, Rehabilitation Research and Training Center Training Center on Community Living, Institute on Community Integration.&lt;/ref&gt; facilitated by Lakin and J.A. Racino  of Syracuse University) were:
* All people with disabilities will be able to live successfully in (and as part of) natural communities that provide them the supports they need.
* All people with disabilities will be recognized for the positive contributions they make to their families and communities.
* All people with disabilities will benefit from enduring relationships with other people (including family members and community members without disabilities).
* All people with disabilities (and their family members) will be entitled to participate in decisions affecting the nature and quality of services they receive.
* All people with disabilities will have access to services and supports that provide choice and support full citizenship.
* Services and supports for people with disabilities will be individualized and responsive to cultural and ethnic differences, economic resources and life circumstances.
* Public policy will provide thee opportunity to enjoy productive, integrated lives.

The 1988 Leadership Institute on Community Integration (From Being in the Community to Being Part of the Community, Steve J. Taylor, director; Julie Ann Racino, deputy director and B. Shoultz, information coordinator), held in Washington, D.C., was sponsored by the Research and Training Center on Community Integration in cooperation with the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, US Department of Education, Beach Center on Families and Disability (University of Kansas), California Research Institute (University of Connecticut), Rehabilitation Research and Training Center (Virginia Commonwealth University), Research and Training Center Consortium on Aging and Developmental Disabilities (an eight-university consortium coordinated by the University of Cincinnati), Research and Training Center on Community Living (University of Minnesota) and the University-Affiliated Program in Developmental Disabilities (University of Illinois at Chicago).&lt;ref&gt;Research and Training Center on Community Integration. (1988). "From Being in the Community to Being Part of the Community."

Charlie Lakin, Ann P. Turnbull and H. Rud Turnbull, Douglas Biklen and Paul Wehman.

By the late 2000s, the Centers were renamed to Community Participation, one aspect of community integration, or to Employment, or other priority areas, such as Health, with many of the above centers still federally funded through the NIDRR program (National Institute on Rehabilitation Research and Rehabilitation), US Department of Education and new academic centers at universities such as Temple University in Pennsylvania.

==Global perspectives==
Researchers in the US (Julie Ann Racino, Syracuse University) and Great Britain (David Towell, King's Fund College) collaborated on community integration, including a 1990 series of international seminars on community integration in the US held at the University of Manchester (Hester Adrian Research Center), Manchester Polytechnic and Manchester Health Authority, the King's Fund College (with Lyn Rucker), Campaign for the Mentally Handicapped (London), University of Wales at Bangor (Center for Social Policy Research), and the University of Wales (Mental Handicap Research Unit). Internationally, research began on the "first integrated generation" in countries such as Sweden&lt;ref&gt;Tideman, M. (2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7370">During [[Home front during World War II|World War II]], a centralised state-run '''Emergency Hospital Service''' was established in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Pre-war and EMS"&gt;Paul Addison, "The Road to 1945", Jonathan Cape, 1975, pp. 178–81.&lt;/ref&gt; It employed doctors and nurses to care for those injured by enemy action and arrange for their treatment across the range of local and charity hospitals that existed at that time. It was also known as the '''Emergency Medical Service''', although this was strictly speaking the medical staff of the service.

==Planning==

According to [[David Stark Murray]] "Until war became imminent it was only with the greatest difficulty that anyone could be persuaded to regard the chaotic and anachronistic structure of medical practice and hospital services as of any real importance to the nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stark Murray|first1=David|title=Health For All|date=1942|publisher=Gollancz|location=London|page=28|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/health-for-all/health-for-all-chapter-3/|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1938 [[London County Council]] seconded staff to the Ministry of Health to assist planning of medical and ambulance services. The [[London Voluntary Hospitals Committee]] negotiated with the Ministry. One of the first tasks was to survey the assortment of mental asylums, public assistance institutions and other hospitals which had been put at the disposal of the service.&lt;ref name="nhshistory.net"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rivett|first1=Geoffrey|title=Emergency Medical Services - 1939-1945|url=http://www.nhshistory.net/ems_1939-1945.htm|website=NHS History|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Cabinet paper in March 1939 showed that there were only about 80,000 beds in England and Wales which could be used for the prolonged treatment of casualties.&lt;ref name="Problems of Social Policy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Titmuss|first1=Richard|title=Problems of Social Policy|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Civil-Social/UK-Civil-Social-5.html|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the surveys in 1937 and 1938 the government had provided nearly 1,000 new operating theatres, 48,000,000 bandages and dressings and 250,000 bedsteads in "hutted annexes".&lt;ref name="The Five Giants"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Timmins|first1=Nicholas|title=The Five Giants|date=1995|publisher=Fontana|location=London|isbn=0006863183|page=103}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Initially John Harry Hebb was appointed Director General. The position was later occupied by Sir [[Francis Richard Fraser]].

==Operation==

The Ministry of Health formulated, and at the outbreak of war put into operation, the Emergency Hospitals Scheme. 2,378 hospitals were included in the scheme at the outbreak of war. They planned for very much larger numbers of air-raid casualties than actually materialised. Up to 67,000 nurses were thought to be needed to care for the expected air-raid casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=161|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 35,000 beds were requisitioned from mental health and mental deficiency hospitals, some of which were provided with X-ray apparatus, laboratories and operating theatres. There were also newly built hutted hospitals which, by the end of 1941, were expected to provide forty-five thousand beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=Charles|title=The Health Services Since the War|date=1988|publisher=HMSO|location=London|isbn=0116309423|page=328}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Many hospitals were removed from cities into the country, so the scheme included provision of an ambulance service for moving patients from one place to another. Hospital blocks of 300 or more beds were allotted for military purposes.&lt;ref name="Problems of Social Policy"/&gt;

A network of Emergency Medical Service Control Centres was established, but the service did not include general practitioners or all specialists.  Air Raid Precautions casualty services remained under separate control.  The Emergency Hospital Service co-ordinated all the hospitals under the Ministry of Health; the hospitals themselves were still administered as in peace time but the Ministry dictated the type of work they did, and the cost of performing it was paid in full to the voluntary hospitals and at 60% to the municipal hospitals. There was a system of area management, co-ordinated by group officers who controlled personnel and equipment which were pooled and allocated to different hospitals as required.  London, where there were 68,000 EHS beds, was divided into nine triangular sectors, each with a large teaching hospital at its apex stretching out to base hospitals up to fifty miles away.  Doctors, initially employed full-time were later paid a retainer fee of £500 a year to carry out part-time duties during the whole of the war and additional duties as needed.&lt;ref name="Health For All"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stark Murray|first1=David|title=Health For All|date=1942|publisher=Gollancz|location=London|page=29|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/health-for-all/health-for-all-chapter-3/|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brook|first1=Charles|title=Memorandum on an Emergency Domiciliary Medical Service|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/the-socialist-health-association/members/distinguished-members/dr-charles-wortham-brook-cbe-1901-1983/memorandum-on-an-emergency-domiciliary-medical-service/|accessdate=28 August 2015|publisher=Socialist Medical Association|date=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arrangements were made for dentists, pharmacists and opticians.&lt;ref name="Problems of Social Policy"/&gt;

By 1942 the hospital service had expanded to include:
* Service casualties and sick, 
* Civil Defence workers, 
* Home Guard, and Police War Reserve injured on duty, 
* Unaccompanied evacuated children, 
* Aged and infirm people evacuated from shelters, 
* Essential war-workers living away from home, 
* Fracture cases among Civil Defence workers, and others essential to industry, 
* Seamen of the Merchant Navy, 
* Evacuated or homeless persons billeted at the Government’s expense, 
* A few other special cases.

A 62-page booklet was issued showing who was eligible.&lt;ref name="The Five Giants"/&gt;

A number of special treatment centres, were established in particular dealing with plastic surgery and war neurosis, together with staff and laboratory facilities for a national blood transfusion service. Laboratories were established both for routine pathology and public health laboratories to diagnose epidemic disease, and to distribute serological products.&lt;ref name="Health For All"/&gt; The neurosis centres were set up first because of fears that public morale might crack under the strain of air bombardment.&lt;ref name="Problems of Social Policy"/&gt;

It was estimated in 1943 that 3,000 beds had been lost in the general hospitals within the London County Council area due to bombing, and more were lost in the flying bomb and rocket attacks of 1944.&lt;ref name="nhshistory.net"/&gt;

'''Francisco Javier Eugenio de Santa Cruz y Espejo'''{{Ref label|A|a|none}} ([[Royal Audiencia of Quito]], 1747–95) was a medical pioneer, writer and lawyer of [[mestizo]] origin in colonial [[Ecuador]]. Although he was a notable scientist and writer, he stands out as a [[polemic]]ist who inspired the [[separatist]] movement in [[Quito]]. He is regarded as one of the most important figures in colonial Ecuador. He was Quito's first journalist and [[hygienist]]. 

As a journalist he spread [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]] ideas in the [[Audiencia Real|Royal Audiencia]], and as a hygienist he composed an important treatise about sanitary conditions in colonial Ecuador that included interesting remarks about [[microorganism]]s and the spreading of disease.

Espejo was noted in his time for being a [[satire|satirist]]. His satirical works, inspired by the philosophy of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], were critical of the lack of education of the Audiencia of Quito, the way the economy was being handled in the Audiencia, the corruption of its authorities, and aspects of its culture in general. Because of these works he was persecuted and finally imprisoned shortly before his death.

==Historical background==
[[File:Mestizo.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A representation of a '''mestizo''' in a "pintura de castas" (painting of castes) in the colonial era. "A Spanish man and an Amerindian woman produce a mestizo," the caption says.]]
The Royal Audiencia of Quito (or Presidency of Quito) was established as part of the Spanish State by [[Philip II of Spain]] on August 29, 1563. It was a court of the Spanish Crown with [[jurisdiction]] over certain territories of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (and later the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]) that now constitute [[Ecuador]] and parts of [[Peru]], [[Colombia]] and [[Brazil]]. The Royal Audiencia was created to strengthen administrative control over those territories and to rule the relations between whites and the natives. Its capital was the city of [[Quito]].&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopedia del Ecuador'', 425&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 18th century, the Royal Audiencia of Quito began to have economic problems; a lack of roads led to limited communications. ''Obrajes''—a type of textile factory—had provided [[Employment|job]]s, but now found themselves in decline, mainly due to a crackdown on smuggled European cloths and a series of natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;Freile, Carlos (1997). Eugenio Espejo y su tiempo, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; ''Obrajes'' were replaced by ''[[hacienda]]s'', and the dominant groups continued to exploit the indigenous population.&lt;ref&gt;Freile, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Royal Audiencia, the education situation worsened after of the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of the Jesuit priests]]; too few learned people lived in Quito to be able to fill the void. The majority of the population neither read nor wrote well. On the other hand, the few who could enter the university were given an education which was heavily theoretical and used memorization as the primary learning technique.&lt;ref&gt;Freile, 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scholasticism]], which was in decline in these times, was still taught; and the students spent their time in metaphysical discussions. As a result, the intellectual people in Quito—most of whom were clerical—had affected manners when expressing themselves, while having no new ideas. Furthermore, in 1793 only two medical doctors were available in Quito, of which one was Espejo; the majority of people who fell ill were helped by [[curandero]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Freile, 40&lt;/ref&gt; In Quito at the time, ethnic prejudice was common, and therefore most people considered society to be divided into [[estates of the realm]], which differed by racial origin. Because of this, a person's [[dignity]] and honor could be damaged by racial prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;Freile, 41–46&lt;/ref&gt;

A slackening of social customs occurred on all social levels; extramarital relationships and illegitimate children were common.&lt;ref&gt;Freile, 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; Because poverty was on the rise—especially in the lower classes—many women were forced to find lodgings quickly, for example in convents, o. This explained the abundance of the clergy in a small city like Quito; often men were ordained not because of a vocation but because it solved their economic problems and improved their community standing.&lt;ref&gt;Freile, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was baptized Francisco Javier Eugenio de Santa Cruz y Espejo in the ''El Sagrario'' parish on February 21, 1747. According to most historians, his father was Luis de la Cruz Chuzhig, a [[Quichua]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] from [[Cajamarca]], who arrived in [[Quito]] as an assistant to the priest and physician José del Rosario, and his mother was Maria Catalina Aldás, a [[mulatta]] native to Quito. However, some historians, especially [[Carlos Freile Granizo]], argue that contemporary documents imply that Espejo's mother was white; for instance, his parents' marriage was recorded in the book for white marriages (as they were deemed as [[Criollo (people)|criollo]]s), and the birth certificates of Espejo and his siblings were entered in the same book.&lt;ref&gt;Freile 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freile, Carlos (1997). Eugenio Espejo, Filósofo, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|B|b|none}}

Espejo had two younger [[siblings]], Juan Pablo and María Manuela. Juan Pablo was born in 1752; he studied with the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and served as a priest in various parts of the Audiencia of Quito. María Manuela was born in 1753, and after the death of her parents she came to be cared for by her brother Eugenio.&lt;ref&gt;Freile, 58&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his family's somewhat unstable economic situation, Espejo had a good education. He instructed himself in medicine by working alongside his father at the ''Hospital de la Misericordia''. According to Espejo, he learned "by experience, which cannot be known without studying with pen in hand."&lt;ref&gt;''Biblioteca de Autores Ecuatorianos de Clásicos Ariel'', No. 56, Tome I, p.12. (citation from ''La ciencia blancardina'', pp. 333–334)&lt;/ref&gt;

Overcoming racial discrimination, he graduated from medical school on July 10, 1767, and shortly afterwards graduated in [[jurisprudence]] and [[canon law]] (having studied law under Dr. Ramón Yépez from 1780 to 1793). On August 14, 1772, he asked for permission to practice medicine in Quito, and it was granted on November 28, 1772.&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopedia del Ecuador'', 746&lt;/ref&gt; After that, no information exists about Espejo's whereabouts until 1778, when he wrote a somewhat polemical sermon.&lt;ref&gt;Freile, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities in the Royal Audiencia===

====Work as a polemicist====
Between 1772 and 1779, Espejo provoked the colonial authorities, who regarded him as responsible for several [[satire|satirical]] and mocking [[poster]]s. These posters were attached to the doors of churches and other buildings, and their anonymous author tended to attack the colonial authorities, the clergy or any other subject he deemed convenient. Although no surviving posters have been found, evidence from comments Espejo made in his writings suggests that he wrote them.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, Philip L. (2003). Eugenio Espejo (1747–1795). Reformador ecuatoriano de la Ilustración, p. 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1779, a reproachful and satirical manuscript was circulated, the ''El nuevo Luciano de Quito'' (The New Lucian of Quito),{{Ref label|C|c|none}} signed by "don Javier de Cía, Apéstegui y Perochena," a pseudonym for Espejo. This work imitated the satire of [[Lucian]], and was especially unsympathetic to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. It showed the culture of its author, who lived in the isolated and intellectually backward city of Quito. ''El Nuevo Luciano de Quito'' was written in dialogues, in order to present his ideas to the common people in an easy way, instead of using tedious explanations meant for scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Paladines, Carlos. (2007). Juicio a Eugenio Espejo, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; It satirized the many defects of the society of Quito, especially the corruption of the colonial authorities and the people's lack of education. The use of a pseudonym, a common practice in Europe and the Americas during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], was important to Espejo. Not only did it provide [[anonymity]], it attempted to remove any hint of his crossbreeding in a culture which granted any white person importance and prestige. His pseudonym implied that he had white or European relatives in his mother's lineage.{{Ref label|D|d|none}}

Beginning in 1779, Espejo continued writing satires against the government of the Audiencia, stirred by the condition of society. In June 1780, Espejo wrote ''Marco Porcio Catón'' ([[Cato the Elder|Marcus Porcius Cato]]),{{Ref label|E|e|none}} Once again, Espejo used a pseudonym, "Moisés Blancardo." In this work, a parodied censor's response to the ''Nuevo Luciano'', he scorned the notions and ideas of its critics. In 1781 he wrote ''La ciencia blancardina'', which he referred to as the second part of ''Nuevo Luciano'', as an answer to the criticism of a [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarian]] priest from Quito.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 82&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his works, by 1783 he was labeled as "restive and subversive."&lt;ref&gt;Biblioteca de Autores Ecuatorianos de Clásicos Ariel, 15&lt;/ref&gt; To get rid of him, the authorities named him head physician for the scientific expedition of Francisco de Requena to the [[Pará]] and [[Marañón River|Marañon]] rivers to set the limits of the Audiencia. Espejo tried to decline the appointment, and after that failed, he tried unsuccessfully to flee. His arrest order details one of the few remaining physical descriptions of him.{{Ref label|F|f|none}} Captured, he was sent back as a "criminal of serious offense,"&lt;ref&gt;Paladines, 32&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not prosecuted and suffered no significant consequences.

====Short exile====
[[File:Quito AvVenezuela basilicadelvotonacional.JPG|thumb|View of Quito today]]
In 1785, he was asked by the ''[[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'' (town council) to write about [[smallpox]], the worst medical problem the [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] faced. Espejo used the opportunity to write his most complete and best-written work,&lt;ref name="Astuto, 177"&gt;Astuto, 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garcés, Enrique (1996). Eugenio Espejo: Médico y duende, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; ''Reflexiones acerca de un método para preservar a los pueblos de las viruelas'' (Reflections about a method to preserve the people from smallpox), denouncing the way the Audiencia handled sanitation. This work is a valuable historical source as a description of the hygienic and sanitary conditions of colonial America.

''Reflexiones'' was sent to [[Madrid]], where it was added as an [[Addendum|appendix]] to the second edition of the medical [[treatise]] ''Disertación médica'' (1786) by Francisco Gil, a member of the ''Real Academia Médica de España''.&lt;ref&gt;Paladines, 38&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of recognition, Espejo acquired enemies because his work criticized the physicians and priests in charge of public health in the Royal Audiencia for their negligence, and he was forced to leave Quito.

On his way to [[Lima]], he stopped in [[Riobamba]], where a group of priests asked him to write a reply to a [[report]] written by Ignacio Barreto, chief tax collector. The report accused the priests of Riobamba of various abuses against the Indians in order to take their money. Espejo gladly accepted the task because he wanted to settle accounts with Barreto and other citizens of Riobamba, among them José Miguel Vallejo, who had turned him in to the authorities when he tried to flee Requena's expedition to the Marañón river.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 85&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote ''Defensa de los curas de Riobamba'' (Defense of the clergy of Riobamba), a detailed study of the way of life of the Indians from Riobamba and a powerful attack on Barreto's report.

In March 1787, he continued his attack against his enemies from Riobamba with a series of eight satirical letters which he called ''Cartas riobambenses''. In response, his enemies denounced Espejo before the President of the Royal Audiencia, Juan José De Villalengua. On August 24, 1787, Villalengua requested that Espejo either to go to Lima or return to Quito to occupy a post in the government,&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 86&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently arrested him. Espejo was accused of writing ''El Retrato de Golilla'', a satire against King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] and the [[Marquis]] de la Sonora, colonial minister of the [[West Indies|Indies]]. He was taken to Quito, and from prison he sent three petitions to the Court in Madrid, which decreed, on Charles III's behalf, that the case was to be taken to the [[Viceroy]] of [[Bogotá]]. President Villalengua feigned ignorance of the matter and sent Espejo to Bogotá to defend his own cause.&lt;ref&gt;Paladines, 39&lt;/ref&gt;

There he met [[Antonio Nariño]] and Francisco Antonio Zea and began to develop his ideas on liberty. In 1789, one of his followers, Juan Pio Montufar, arrived in Bogotá, and both men got the approval of important members of the government for the creation of the ''[[Escuela de la Concordia]]'', called later the ''[[Sociedad Patriótica de Amigos del País de Quito]]'' (Patriotic Society of Friends of the Country of Quito).&lt;ref name="A88"&gt;Astuto, 88&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sociedad Económica de los Amigos del País]] (Economic Society of Friends of the Country) was a private association established in various cities throughout Enlightenment Spain and, to a lesser degree, in some of her colonies. Espejo successfully defended himself on the charges against him, and on October 2, 1789, he was set free. On December 2 he was notified he could return to Quito.&lt;ref name="A88"/&gt;

===Final years===
In 1790, Espejo returned to Quito to promote the "[[Sociedad Económica de los Amigos del País|Sociedad Patriótica]]" (Patriotic Society), and on November 30, 1791, a branch was established in the ''Colegio de los Jesuitas''; he was elected director and formed four commissions. In the same year, he became director of the first public library, the National Library, originally established with the forty thousand volumes left by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] after their expulsion from Ecuador.&lt;ref name="EE47"&gt;''Enciclopedia del Ecuador, 747&lt;/ref&gt;

The main duty of the Society was improving the city of Quito. Its 24 members came together weekly to discuss agricultural, educational, political and social problems and to promote the physical and natural sciences. The Society founded Quito's first newspaper, ''Primicias de la Cultura de Quito'', published by Espejo starting on January 5, 1792. Through this newspaper [[liberalism|liberal ideas]], already somewhat known in other parts of [[Hispanic America]], were spread among the people of Quito.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eugenio Espejo (signature).jpg|thumb|right|Eugenio Espejo's signature]]
On November 11, 1793, [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] dissolved the society.&lt;ref&gt;Freile, 64&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the newspaper disappeared as well. Espejo had no choice but to work as a librarian in the National Library. Because of his liberal ideas, he was imprisoned{{Ref label|G|g|none}} on January 30, 1795, being allowed to leave his cell only to treat his patients as a doctor and, on December 23, to die at his home from the [[dysentery]] he acquired during his imprisonment.&lt;ref name="A95"&gt;Astuto, 95&lt;/ref&gt; Eugenio Espejo died on December 28. His [[death certificate]] was registered in the book for Indians, mestizos, [[Black people|blacks]] and mulattoes.

==Character==
Eugenio Espejo was an [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]], and he claimed with pride that he never left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would make up for it by observing [[nature]]. However, his desire to read everything indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 75&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|H|h|none}} Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic in the formation of the self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.&lt;ref name="EE47"/&gt;

By his writing, Espejo wanted to educate the people and to awaken a rebellious spirit in them. He embraced [[Egalitarianism|equality]] between Indians and criollos, an ideal that was ignored during the future processes of independence.{{Ref label|I|i|none}} He also favored women's rights but did not really develop these ideas.{{Ref label|J|j|none}} He had an advanced understanding of science, considering the circumstances in which he lived. He never traveled abroad but nonetheless understood the relation between [[microorganisms]] and the spreading of disease.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio Espejo, Bacteriólogo&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|K|k|none}}

When he was arrested, it was rumored that his detention resulted from his support of the "impieties" of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="A95"/&gt; However, Espejo was one of the few people at the time who distinguished between the actual deeds of the French Revolution and the [[Irreligion|irreligious]] spirit connected to it, while his contemporaries in Spain and the colonies erroneously identified the [[Freedom (political)|emancipation]] of the Americas with loss of the Catholic faith. The accusation of impiety was calculated to incite popular hatred against him. Espejo never lost his faith in Catholicism throughout his lifetime. He condemned the decadence of the clergy, but he never criticized the Church itself.&lt;ref&gt;Confront with Astuto, 95&lt;/ref&gt; Eugenio Espejo had a restless desire for knowledge and was anxious to reform by his works a state that seemed to him, influenced as he was by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], to be [[barbarian]] in every way.&lt;ref&gt;Confront with Weber, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==

===Views on education===
The goal of Espejo's first three works was the intellectual improvement of Quito. ''El Nuevo Luciano de Quito'' ridiculed the outdated educational system maintained by the clergy. Espejo argued that the people of Quito were accustomed to adulation and that they admired any preacher who could quote the Bible in a pompous and insubstantial way. ''Marco Porcio Catón'' exposed the ignorance of the [[pseudointellectual]]s of Quito. ''La ciencia blancardina'', in which Espejo claimed to be the author of the previous two works, condemned the results of the clergy's educational system: [[ignorance]] and affectation.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 99&lt;/ref&gt; All three works caused polemic.
[[File:Benito Jerónimo Feijoo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Espejo was influenced by European scholars, such as [[Benito Jerónimo Feijóo e Montenegro|Benito Jerónimo Feijóo]].]]

Through these three books, Espejo advanced the ideas of European and American scholars such as Feijoo and the Jesuits [[Luís António Verney|Verney]] and Guevara, among others.  As a result, many religious orders modified their educational programs. Espejo resented the pseudointellectuals who misled the thought of the city of Quito, disregarding people who were actually knowledgeable.&lt;ref&gt;Freile, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Espejo particularly criticized the Jesuits for, among other things, teaching ethics not as a science but as a guide to good [[manners]] and for their adoption of [[Catholic Probabilism|Probabilism]] as a [[Morality|moral]] guide.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; He complained about the lax system for educating priests in Quito and said it instilled slothful habits in students. As a result, the priests had no real idea of their duties towards society and God and had little inclination to study. In ''El Nuevo Luciano de Quito'', he lamented the large number of quacks who pretended to be doctors. In ''La ciencia blancardina'' he continued his attack on these quacks while attacking clerics who worked as physicians without adequate medical education.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on theology===
In 1780, in his first discussion of purely religious matters, Espejo wrote a [[Theology|theological]] letter, ''Carta al Padre la Graña sobre indulgencias'' (Letter to Father la Graña about indulgences).{{Ref label|L|l|none}} In this work, he looked at [[indulgence]]s in the Catholic Church. The letter showed a profound knowledge of theology and [[dogma]]. It analyzed the historical beginnings of indulgences and their development and cited decrees and [[papal bull|bulls]] written about abuses of indulgences.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 137&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Espejo staunchly supported the authority of the Pope.

On July 19, 1792, Espejo wrote another letter, ''Segunda carta teológica sobre la Inmaculada Concepción de María'' (Second theological letter about Mary's Immaculate Conception), in response to a request by the inspector of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]].{{Ref label|M|m|none}} This letter dealt with the [[Immaculate Conception]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. Once more, this work showed its author's deep knowledge of this religious subject and his appreciation of its standing in the 18th century. (The Immaculate Conception was not formally decreed as dogma until 1950.)&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Espejo also wrote a series of sermons, which were notable in their simplicity. Ecuadorian historian and cleric [[Federico González Suárez]] considered these sermons worthy of study, even though he mentioned that they lacked an "evangelic spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 139&lt;/ref&gt; Espejo can be considered a deeply religious man.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on economics===
Starting in 1785, Espejo took an interest in the welfare of his community and the prosperity of Quito. His works between that year and 1792 clearly show the influence of Enlightenment philosophers, whose ideas Espejo adapted to local conditions. As many thinkers realized the power of economics as a social force, Espejo, influenced by Feijoo and [[Adam Smith]] among others, showed his desire for commercial and agricultural reforms, especially conservation and proper use of [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]]. To advance these ideas, he founded the ''Escuela de la Concordia'' (School of Concord).&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 145–146&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''Voto de un ministro togado de la Audiencia de Quito'' and ''Memorias sobre el corte de quinas'' rejected a proposed monopoly of [[quinine]] production by the Crown intended to prevent the destruction of the [[cinchona]] tree and to expand the Royal Treasury's income. ''Memorias'' was dedicated to Fernando Cuadrado, who opposed the monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 150&lt;/ref&gt;

Espejo divided his cinchona study into four parts. In the first, he argued that the monopoly would leave workers without jobs and that it would mean the loss of capital invested in cinchona trees. In the second part, he made a number of suggestions, such as developing certain "natural" products of a region with the aim of exporting them. For instance, in [[Chile]] the production of wines should be prioritized, in [[Argentina]] the production of leather, and so forth. In the third part he showed that many workers benefited from the quinine industry, that without it there would be unemployment and unrest, and that the Crown should designate officials to regulate the proper cultivation of the cinchona tree, including reforestation. In the fourth part he made recommendations, such as the need to repress indigenous hostility in the cinchona tree region.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 151–155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work as a lawyer===
His ''Defensa de los curas de Riobamba'' was written in response to a report from Ignacio Barreto that accused the clergy in Riobamba of various unethical practices. Among other things, the report said that the large number of religious celebrations in Riobamba (frequented by Indians) were prejudicial to Catholic faith, agriculture, industry and the interests of the Crown; also, that priests demanded money from the Indians for entrance into churches and for certain ceremonies, that priests in Riobamba were immoral and finally that most sermons were incomprehensible to the Indians.&lt;ref name="A156"&gt;Astuto, 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eugenioespejo2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Eugenio Espejo, anonymous oil painting]]

Espejo attacked Barreto's report in three ways. First, he claimed that Barreto, supposed author of the report, was not capable of writing it. Then he argued that the allegations were exaggerated semi-truths or outright lies. And finally he claimed that the economic problems of Quito could not be solved by exploiting its human resources (the Indians) but by planning and taking advantage of the natural resources of the region.&lt;ref name="A156"/&gt;

Espejo realized that the charges against the clergy were so serious that he had to focus on destroying Barreto's [[credibility]]. Therefore, he implied that Barreto's own conduct was outrageous because of his excesses in collecting taxes and his habit of paying public funds to licentious women. Additionally, he stated that the real author of the report was José Miguel Vallejo, whom he called an immoral man who despised the clergy. Thus, Espejo claimed the report should not be believed.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 157&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that Espejo was motivated more by the opportunity to attack his personal enemies in this work than to analyze the case and defend the clergy of Riobamba. Still, his talent as a lawyer can be seen in his ''Representaciones'' (Representations), which caused him to be freed after his arrest in 1787 for his supposed authorship of ''El Retrato de Golilla''.&lt;ref&gt;Paladines, 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; In these documents, he defended his loyalty to the Crown, commented on the unfairness of his captivity by mentioning the indignation that many distinguished men felt about his arrest, and clarified his writing goals. This served him as a prelude to his main subject: denying being the author of ''El Retrato de Golilla''

===Scientific work===
The Spanish Crown was deeply concerned with [[public health]]. Diseases had always troubled the colonies, and town councils spent money to bring physicians or sanitary equipment from other parts of the Americas. Reports by doctors about the sanitary and hygienic conditions of various neighborhoods of the cities were frequent.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 175–176&lt;/ref&gt; As a man of science, Eugenio Espejo demonstrated his knowledge of the latest scientific advances in Europe and the Americas. Most of the arguments and recommendations he made in his medical works can be found in contemporary sources, such as the ''Mémoires'' of the [[French Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 176&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eugenio Espejo bust.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Eugenio Espejo, bust placed in Casa de la Cultura, Quito.]]

The Presidency of Quito was especially concerned with prevention of smallpox. Villalengua, President of the Audiencia, gathered all of Quito's physicians to discuss the application of methods suggested by the Spanish scientist Francisco Gil, and Espejo was asked to write his ''Reflexiones acerca de un método para preservar a los pueblos de las viruelas''."{{Ref label|N|n|none}} ''Reflexiones'', completed on November 11, 1785, was divided in two parts: the first dealt with prevention of smallpox in Quito, while the second dealt with obstacles on the path to its eradication. Espejo's knowledge of inoculations and the quarantine of smallpox victims was remarkably advanced for his day.&lt;ref name="Astuto, 177"/&gt;

''Reflexiones'' recommended using proven methods supported by Spanish and foreign doctors. It refuted the common belief that the separation and destruction of contaminated clothes was impractical, and it promoted [[hygiene|personal hygiene]] among the people of Quito. Espejo tried to convince people of the dangers of smallpox. He understood the current European medical theories about contagious diseases and warned against the incorrect belief that smallpox was transmitted by polluted air. Citing the English doctor [[Thomas Sydenham]], he suggested the construction of an isolated country house as a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

Dealing with sanitation, Espejo observed that the hospital (''Hospital de la Misericordia'') of the city, the monasteries and the places of worship were filthy and that this would certainly contribute to future epidemics. He disapproved of the custom of burying the dead inside churches; instead, he suggested burying the dead outside the city limits in a graveyard chosen by the Church and owned by the town council.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 179&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, he condemned the management of the hospital by the [[Bethlehemites]]. He said their methods were outdated and that they provided poor service. The staff of the hospital reacted badly to this, and Espejo lost the friendship of his mentor, José del Rosario.&lt;ref&gt;Astuto, 182&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:00500+Sucres+Bill+Ecuador+1988.jpg|thumb|right|Espejo appeared on the 500 [[Ecuadorian sucre|sucres]] banknote.]]
Espejo is considered the precursor of the independence movement in Quito. He died in 1795, but his ideas had a powerful influence on three of his close friends: [[Juan Pío Montúfar]], [[Juan de Dios Morales]] and [[Juan de Salinas]]. They, along with [[Manuel Rodriguez Quiroga]], founded the revolutionary movement of August 10, 1809, in Quito, when the city declared independence from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Hurtado, Osvaldo (2003). El Poder Político en el Ecuador, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Espejo published Quito's first newspaper, and therefore he is regarded as the founder of Ecuadorian journalism. He is considered Ecuador's first literary critic; according to Spanish scholar [[Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo]], Espejo's ''Nuevo Luciano'' is the oldest critical work written in South America.&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopedia del Ecuador'', 509&lt;/ref&gt;

His influence can as well be seen in Ecuadorian thought in general, as his work has been one of its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopedia del Ecuador'', 642&lt;/ref&gt; and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with [[Pedro Vicente Maldonado]], one of the two most important scientists of colonial Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;Biblioteca de Autores Ecuatorianos de Clásicos Ariel, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and their lack of good education, and he denounced the corruption of the colonial authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Freile, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, Espejo has been depicted on the obverse of Ecuador's 10 centavo coin.

==Notes==
{{refbegin|30em}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} There are discrepancies about the origin of the surnames "Santa Cruz y Espejo;" José del Rosario declared that his father, Luis Espejo, was first named Benítez, changed his surname to Chusig and finally to Espejo. Ecuadorian researcher Alberto Muñoz Vernaza claimed that his real surname was Espejo and that the name Chusig (owl) was a nickname Espejo had in Cajamarca. According to José del Rosario, the surname "Santa Cruz" was added "because of devotion" (Astuto, Philip L., ''Eugenio Espejo (1747–1795). Reformador ecuatoriano de la Ilustración'', p.&amp;nbsp;73).

'''b.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}} Freile maintains that the notion of Espejo's indigenous origins sustained by most modern historians comes from their interpretation of the claims made against him by his contemporary enemies, who called him "indio" (Indian) in order to slander him in a racist society.

'''c.''' {{Note label|C|c|none}} Its full name is ''El nuevo Luciano de Quito o Despertador de los ingenios quiteños en nueve conversaciones eruditas para el estímulo de la literatura''.

'''d.''' {{Note label|D|d|none}} Aware of the prejudices of the society of his time, Espejo requested a dossier that proved his Spanish lineage. The dossier mentioned that Espejo's mother was born from a noble Navarran family. When he asked for the post of librarian in 1781, he showed that certificate (Astuto, 78–79).

'''e.''' {{Note label|E|e|none}} Its full name is ''Marco Porcio Catón o Memorias para la impugnación del nuevo Luciano de Quito''.

'''f.''' {{Note label|F|f|none}} "He has average height, long face, long nose, tanned skin, and a visible hole on the left side of his face" (Herrera, Pablo, ''Ensayo sobre la historia de la literatura ecuatoriana'', pp.&amp;nbsp;125, 145).

'''g.''' {{Note label|G|g|none}} The authorities finally found evidence against Espejo when his brother, Juan Pablo, told his lover, Francisca Navarrete, about the plans of Eugenio. He was charged with treachery to the Crown (Astuto, 94).

'''h.''' {{Note label|H|h|none}} One of his characters thought it paradoxical to live in what he called "the era of idiocy and . . . the century of ignorance" and yet refer to it as the Age of Enlightenment. (Weber, David J., ''Spaniards and Their Savages in the Age of Enlightenment'', p.&amp;nbsp;5).

'''i.''' {{Note label|I|i|none}} "Los miserables indios, en tanto que no tengan, por patrimonio y bienes de fortuna, más que sólo sus brazos, no han de tener nada que perder. Mientras no los traten mejor; no les paguen con más puntualidad, su cortísimo salario; no les aumenten el que deben llevar por su trabajo; no les introduzcan el gusto de vestir, de comer, y de la policía en general; no les hagan sentir que son hermanos, nuestros estimables y nobilísimos siervos, nada han de tener que ganar, y por consiguiente la pérdida ha de ser ninguna" (Biblioteca de Autores Ecuatorianos de Clásicos Ariel, 24).

'''j.''' {{Note label|J|j|none}} According to Philip Astuto, "He thought that the solution to such plain ignorance was the construction of schools and the education of youth without excluding women" (Astuto, 93).

'''k.''' {{Note label|K||none}} "Si se pudieran apurar más las observaciones microscópicas, aún más allá a lo que las adelantaron Malpigio, Reaumur, Buffon y Needham, quizá encontraríamos en la incubación, desarrollamiento, situación, figura, movimiento y duración de estos corpúsculos móvibles, la regla que podría servir a explicar toda la naturaleza, grados, propiedades y síntomas de todas las fiebres epidémicas, y en particular de la Viruela" (Biblioteca de Autores Ecuatorianos de Clásicos Ariel, 22).

'''l.''' {{Note label|L|l|none}} Its full name is ''Carta del padre La Graña del orden de San Francisco, sobre indulgencias escrita por el mismo doctor Espejo, tomando el nombre de este padre que fue sabio y de gran erudición''.

'''m.''' {{Note label|M|m|none}} In 1792, the Dominicans of the Convento Máximo de Quito published a series of theological theses. One of them stated that original sin was transmitted to every single descendant of Adam, without exception. As it never mentioned the subject of the Virgin Mary, it was rumoured that the Dominicans took the view that Mary was born with original sin. The Inspector denounced the thesis, and in face of the protest of the Dominicans, entrusted Espejo with replying to the Dominican thesis and rebutting their ideas (Astuto, 138).

'''n.''' {{Note label|N|n|none}} Its full name is ''Reflexiones sobre la virtud, importancia y conveniencias que propone don Francisco Gil, cirujano del Real Monasterio de San Lorenzo y su sitio, e individuo de la Real Academia Médica de Madrid, en su Disertación físico-médica, acerca de un método seguro para preservar a los pueblos de las viruelas''.

The '''European Health Examination Survey''' ('''EHES''') is an ongoing series of large-scale clinical epidemiological studies. It is a cooperative effort among multiple European nations, in concert with the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) and the [[Free trade areas in Europe|European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). While actual data collection is carried out through the health ministries of each participating nation, the coordination of these efforts across borders is under the jurisdiction of the [[European Commission]]'s [[Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety]].

== Overview ==
A [[General medical examination|health examination]] survey consists of the collection of both interview data (in the form of a self-guided questionnaire, an interview with a medical professional, or both) and physical examination data such as blood testing and weight measurement.&lt;ref name=bulmer12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=malta10 /&gt;

== History ==
National-level [[Health Examination Survey]]s (HES) had been carried out by multiple European countries beginning in the late 1950s, with increased interest in conducting HESs by national governments beginning around the year 2000,&lt;ref name=etal08 /&gt; but there was no standardisation of parameters between countries prior to 2009.&lt;ref name=apr14&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tolonen|first1=Hanna|last2=Koponen|first2=Päivikki|last3=Mindell|first3=Jennifer|last4=Männistö|first4=Satu|last5=Kuulasmaa|first5=Kari|title=European Health Examination Survey — towards a sustainable monitoring system|journal=[[European Journal of Public Health]]|date=April 2014|volume=24|issue=2|pages=338–44|doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckt107|pmid=23867563|url=http://eurpub.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/2/338.long|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With nearly 20 European countries planning to conduct their own HESs within a five-year window, it was decided that standardization of survey protocols was a priority.&lt;ref name=overview /&gt;

=== FEHES ===
[[File:Fotothek df n-06 0000374.jpg|thumb|270px|Blood pressure readings are an essential component of the EHES]]
From 2006–2008, the feasibility of creating a single standardized HES for all [[European Union]] (EU) member nations and all members of the [[European Free Trade Association]]/[[European Economic Area]] (EFTA/EEA) was evaluated by the Feasibility of the European Health Examination Survey (FEHES) Project. This project concluded that such a standardized HES was indeed feasible, and proposed a two-phase approach to the EHES project.&lt;ref name=etal08 /&gt; Phase one would involve establishing centralized coordination for the project, conducting pilot surveys for an initial 8–12 nations, and designing and preparing full-scale surveys for those initial HESs. Phase two would involve carrying out the full-scale surveys in the initial 8–12 nations, and coordinating the design and preparation of full-scale surveys in the other European countries.&lt;ref name=apr14 /&gt;

FEHES also made recommendations regarding data management; documentation and reporting; establishing and maintaining international collaboration; ethical and legal issues; measurements to be included in the pilot HESs; models for the organization of national HES infrastructure; recruitment or study participants; sampling issues; and standardization of measurement protocols.&lt;ref name=etal08&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tolonen, Hanna|author2=Koponen, Päivikki|author3=Aromaa, Arpo|author4=Conti, Susanna|author5=Graff-Iversen, Sidse|author6=Grøtvedt, Liv|author7=Heldal, Johan|author8=Kanieff, Mark|author9=Mindell, Jennifer|author10=Natunen, Sanna|author11=Primatesta, Paola|author12=Verschuren, Monique|author13=Viet, Lucie|author14=Kuulasmaa, Kari|title=Recommendations for organizing a standardized European Health Examination Survey|date=2008|publisher=National Public Health Institute (Finland)|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-951-740-841-7|pages=1|url=http://www.julkari.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/78264/2008b22.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The countries expected to be part of an eventual Europe-wide Health Examination Survey as of 2008 were [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], the former Yugoslavian [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Malta]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=etal08 /&gt;

=== The EHES pilot program ===
The pilot project for the European HES, funded by the [[European Commission]], was carried out from 2009–2012. Coordination for the pilot project was administered by the EHES Pilot Reference Centre (EHES RC), a collaboration between Finland's [[National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland)|National Institute for Health and Welfare]] (THL), Italy's [[Istituto Superiore di Sanità]] (ISS), and Norway's [[Statistics Norway]] (SSB).

[[File:Blood test.jpg|left|thumb|Blood tests are another essential component of the European Health Examination Survey, used to measure cholesterol and glucose levels]]
EHES RC created a centralised system for data management and reporting of survey data, designed and produced training seminars for participating countries, provided logistical support to countries participating in the pilot studies, published standardized HES protocols in an ''EHES Manual'', and supervised both internal and external quality control for the EHES. The ''EHES Manual'' defined protocols for health measurements, described organization of the fieldwork, discussed ethical issues, established definitions of data-reporting indicators, included information on sampling, and provided "other details relating to the planning and conducting of a national HES."&lt;ref name=apr14 /&gt; The final version of the ''EHES Manual'' incorporated revisions based on discoveries made during the pilot program.&lt;ref name=apr14 /&gt;

Pilot project preliminary surveys were carried out in 12 countries: the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, and the UK. (In Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK, HESs were already under way when the pilot program began, thus the primary focus of the pilot program in those countries was evaluating the feasibility of converting the existing programs to match the EHES standards.)&lt;ref name=apr14 /&gt; Initially, Hungary and Spain were going to be included in the pilot project as well,&lt;ref name=malta10&gt;{{cite web|title=European Health Examination Survey 2010|url=https://health.gov.mt/en/dhir/Pages/Surveys/eurohealthexamsurvey2010.aspx|website=health.gov.mt|publisher=Government of Malta official website|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but logistical problems prevented their participation.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The countries included were chosen based on their either already having begun a national HES, or being in the early planning stages for such a survey.&lt;ref name=etal08 /&gt; These pilot studies established standardised protocols for the measurement of key risk factors for chronic disease, such as blood lipids, blood glucose, blood pressure, height, waist circumference and weight.&lt;ref name=overview /&gt; Standardised questions for the questionnaire portion of the EHES were also developed, covering such topics as current health status, [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] history, socio-economic status, and use of health care services; as much as possible, questions conformed to the [[European Health Interview Survey]].

Plans for training of personnel were developed, as were plans for external quality assessment. The minimum sample size in each pilot project country was 200 individuals between 25 and 64 years of age. The pilot survey project succeeded at standardizing HES measurements across populations despite participant countries having differing cultural settings, economic statuses, infrastructures and levels of previous experience conducting an HES.&lt;ref name=apr14 /&gt;

Since 7 January 2008 the law allows the terminally ill —or closest relatives, if unconscious— to refuse medication or further medical treatment that may extend life (known as passive euthanasia) in [[Mexico City]],&lt;ref name="eluniversal-df"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/472474.html|title=Publica GDF Ley de Voluntad Anticipada |date=7 January 2008 |newspaper=El Universal|agency=Notimex |language=Spanish |accessdate=25 September 2009|location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the state of [[Aguascalientes]] (since 6 April 2009)&lt;ref name="jornada-ags"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lja.mx/2009/04/solo-falta-reglamentar-la-voluntad-anticipada-para-aplicarla-ruvalcaba/|title=Sólo falta reglamentar la voluntad anticipada para aplicarla: Ruvalcaba |date=8 April 2009 |newspaper=La Jornada Aguascalientes |language=Spanish |accessdate=26 September 2009|first=Susana | last=Rodríguez |author2=Salazar, Aníbal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, since 1 September 2009, in the state of [[Michoacán]].&lt;ref name="eleconomista-mich"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/notas-online/politica/2009/09/01/michoacan-aprueba-ley-voluntad-anticipada|title=Michoacán aprueba Ley de Voluntad Anticipada|date=1 September 2009|newspaper=El Economista| agency=Notimex |language=Spanish| accessdate=25 September 2009| location=Morelia, Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the exact procedure may vary, the regional laws dealing with [[advance health care directive|living wills]] —usually called {{lang|es|leyes de Voluntad Anticipada}}— generally require a [[notary public]] to witness the instructions left by the patient.

As for active euthanasia, the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] (PRD) and the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) have introduced bills to decriminalize it in both the [[Senate of Mexico|Senate]] (2007)&lt;ref name="reuters-active-mx"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKN1238979720070413|title=Mexico moves to legalise euthanasia |date=13 April 2007|agency=Reuters |accessdate=25 September 2009|location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Legislative Assembly of the Federal District]] (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/cultura_sociedad/2009/11/091125_0439_eutanasia_mexico_mz.shtml|title=Crece debate por eutanasia en México DF |date=26 November 2009|newspaper=BBC Mundo|language= Spanish|accessdate=23 December 2010|last=Barría|first=Cecilia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but have failed to change the Article 166 bis 21 of the General Health Law, which still defines euthanasia as mercy [[homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=482389|title=PAN y PRD matan la ley priista de eutanasia en ALDF |date=21 January 2010|last=Cruz González|first=René|language=Spanish |accessdate=23 December 2010|newspaper = La Crónica de Hoy|location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, {{as of|2010|12|lc=y}}, 18 out of 31 states have modified their constitution under pressure from the dominant [[Catholic Church]] to protect the [[right to life]] "from the moment of conception until natural death",&lt;ref name="Bremer_2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/08/AR2005070801730.html|title=Euthanasia Stance Affirmed in Mexico|last=Bremer|first=Catherine|date=9 July 2005|newspaper=Washington Post| agency=Reuters|page=B08 |accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively discarding any initiative contemplating active euthanasia within state borders.

==Practice==

{{Euthanasia}}

Official statistics are scarce but bioethicist Horacio García Romero claims that up to 45% of the terminally-ill patients in the country demand some form of passive euthanasia.&lt;ref name="cronica"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=315674|title=En México, 45% de enfermos terminales son sometidos a eutanasia pasiva, dice especialista en bioética|last=Sánchez Limón|first=Moisés|date=5 August 2007|newspaper=La Crónica de Hoy|language=Spanish |accessdate=25 September 2009 |location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2010 the secretary of health for Mexico City announced that, since the legalization of passive euthanasia, 497 patients have formalized the process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/ciudad/103621.html|title=497 personas asumen ley de Voluntad Anticipada |date=8 October 2010|newspaper=El Universal|language=Spanish | last=López|first=Allan|accessdate=23 December 2010|location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt; including at least 41 out-of-state residents and 2 citizens of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/680151.html|title=Suscriben 391 personas documento de Voluntad Anticipada |date=13 May 2010|newspaper=El Universal|last=Balboa|first=Berenice|language=Spanish |accessdate=23 December 2010|location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Public opinion and political lobbying==

According to a Parametría poll conducted in February 2008, 59% of Mexicans think doctors should have the legal right to end the life of a person suffering from an incurable illness upon a request by the patient and his or her relatives, while 35% disagree.&lt;ref name="parametria-poll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/many_mexicans_open_to_legal_euthanasia1/|title=Many Mexicans Open to Legal Euthanasia| date = 8 May 2008|publisher=Angus Reid Global Monitor/Parametría|accessdate= 25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Its main opponents, [[pro-life]] activists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?idc=184264 |title=Provida pide a Frenk abstenerse de organizar debates sobre eutanasia |date=30 May 2005|newspaper=La Crónica de Hoy|language=Spanish|accessdate=23 December 2010|agency= Notimex}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christianism|Christian churches]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://impreso.milenio.com/node/7043002 |title=Cristianos se unen contra el aborto y la eutanasia |date=16 November 2008|newspaper=Milenio|language=Spanish|accessdate=23 December 2010|last=Nájar|first=Alberto}}&lt;/ref&gt; —particularly the dominant [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]— have strongly lobbied against active euthanasia and promote different bills protecting the [[right to life]] "from the moment of conception until natural death."&lt;ref name="Bremer_2005" /&gt; However, regional bills supporting passive euthanasia have been endorsed by several Catholic clergymen, including the archbishops of [[León, Guanajuato|León]]&lt;ref name="eluniversal-iglesia-leon"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.milenio.com/node/567691|title=Arzobispo de León está a favor del bien morir |last=Domínguez |first=Pedro|date=1 November 2010 |newspaper=Milenio |language=Spanish |accessdate= 23 December 2010 |location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Morelia]].&lt;ref name="eluniversal-iglesia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/623632.html|title=Iglesia de Michoacán avala Ley de Voluntad Anticipada |last=Silva |first=Azucena|date=2009-09-01 |newspaper=El Universal |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-09-25 |location=Morelia, Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suicide tourism==
{{main|Suicide tourism}}

A drug known as liquid [[pentobarbital]] is used by owners to euthanize pets. When given to humans, the drug can give them a painless death in under one hour. The pet shops across Mexico have such drugs. As a result, elderly tourists from across the globe seeking to terminate their own lives were reported to be flying out to Mexico. &lt;ref name="reuters-mx"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN0329945820080603?sp=true|title=Euthanasia tourists snap up pet shop drug in Mexico|last=Emmott|first=Robin |author2=Hernández, Magdiel |author3=Bremer, Catherine |author4=Chiacu, Doina|date=3 June 2008|agency=Reuters|accessdate=25 September 2009|location=Nuevo Laredo, Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3906">The '''Forensic Medicine Division''' of the Applied Sciences Group of the [[Health Sciences Authority]] is a forensic medical consultancy service of the government of [[Singapore]].  The Centre provides professional consultancy services in the field of [[forensic medicine]], primarily to law enforcement in support of the coronial death investigation system in Singapore as well as criminal investigations into homicidal deaths.  The Division operates a mortuary facility in Block 9, a Singapore General Hospital building along Outram Road.

==History==
In the 1960s to 1980s, the Department of Forensic Medicine (DFM) was a section within the Department of Pathology under the Ministry of Health. In 1989, it was known as the Department of Forensic Medicine within the Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine (ISFM).  When the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) of Singapore came into being in April 2001, DFM was renamed the Centre for Forensic Medicine and became one of seven centres within the Health Sciences Authority.  With effect from 1 August 2008, it is renamed the [[Forensic medicine division|Forensic Medicine Division]], a part of the Applied Sciences Group, Health Sciences Authority.

From the 1960s, the section and then Department of Forensic Medicine was led by the late Professor [[Chao Tzee Cheng]], who is deemed by many to be the "Father of Forensic Medicine" in Singapore. Prof Chao had been involved in many high-profile homicides and had documented some of them in his book ''Murder is my Business''.  The current Divisional Director is Dr. Paul Chui.

==Services==
FMD provides medical consultancy services to the State Coroner in support of death investigation in Singapore. It also provides forensic medical consultancy on request in clinical forensic cases. It also provides technical support to the [[Singapore Police Force]] in the handling of sexual assault kits. Autopsy services for non-Coroner's cases are also available on request.

The Division is staffed by Forensic Pathologists, Technical support officers, Mortuary technicians and administrative staff. It has been accredited by the [[National Association of Medical Examiners]] (NAME),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thename.org&lt;/ref&gt; successfully in 2005, the first centre to achieve accreditation outside of North America. The late Professor [[Chao Tzee Cheng]], generally acknowledged as the Father of Forensic Medicine in Singapore, was the first professional head. Dr Wee Keng Poh took over the helm in the late 1990s. The team is now headed by Dr Paul Chui since April 2001.

The mortuary facility resides on the ground floor of Block 9 along [[Outram Road]]. Prior to this location, the mortuary was located at the present junction of Second Hospital Avenue and Outram Road. Presently, the facility houses a main autopsy suite as well as an adjoining x-ray facility and an isolation autopsy suite. Originally built in the early 1980s, it was extensively renovated and upgraded in March to June 2003, during the SARS outbreak in Singapore. Part of the upgrading in 2003 included a larger public waiting area, incorporation of biosafety systems and practices; and re-orientation of the internal layout with sequestration of claiming areas. Transformational change to the grounds meant that trees and shrubs that once hid the building from view for decades were pruned to introduce more natural lighting to the compound as well as the waiting area; to alleviate the sense of gloom and doom and the sense of fear and trepidation to passers-by as well as leading to overall improvement of security in the compound.

==Education==
Mesibov received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Stanford University]] and his [[Master of Arts]] degree from the [[University of Michigan]]. He received his [[doctorate]] from [[Brandeis University]] and completed his [[postdoctoral fellowship]] at the [[University of North Carolina]].

==Career==

===Professor and researcher===
Mesibov was a professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill for 35 years. All but 4 of those 35 years Mesibov was on the UNC [[Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children]] (TEACCH)  faculty. From 1992 to 2012 he was the TEACCH director. TEACCH, founded by UNC psychiatry and psychology professor [[Eric Schopler]], is a "pioneering" program for assisting with [[autism spectrum disorder]] education, research and service delivery for children and adults. As a result of his work, he is an "internationally recognized leader in autism research and practice."&lt;ref name=HunterBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNC-stepdown&gt;[http://www.med.unc.edu/www/newsarchive/2010/february/gary-mesibov-to-step-down-as-director-of-unc2019s-teacch-program ''Gary Mesibov to step down as director of UNC’s TEACCH program''.] University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Retrieved September 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1984, Mesibov noted pediatric psychologists worked frequently with developmental disorders in children.  Specifically, children with "mental retardation, learning disabilities, cerebral palsy, autism, and related developmental problems. When not working directly with children, pediatric psychologists role included had a few other components.  The demand and importance of parent training for children with developmental problems made it the subject of the Society of Pediatric Psychology (SPP) programming at the American Psychological Association (APA) convention for 1983.  The collaboration with other professionals on site (e.g., speech and language therapists) provided education in outside domains and in working as a member of an interdisciplinary team. Furthermore, pediatric psychologists helped to create programs in the community addressing children's needs.&lt;ref&gt;Gary B. Mesibov  (1984). "Evolution of pediatric psychology: Historical roots to future trends." ''Journal of Pediatric Psychology'', 9, 3-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a brief article following his reception of the 1990 Distinguished Service Award from the SPP, Mesibov reflected on three unique, or "special" characteristics he identified within the field of pediatric psychology.  Specifically, he applauded the field's practical application to tackle difficult human needs, multidisciplinary approach, and character of pediatric psychologists he has worked with throughout his career.&lt;ref name=Mesibov1991&gt;Mesibov, G. B. (1991). "What is special about pediatric psychology." ''Journal of Pediatric Psychology'', 16, 267-271.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editor===
By 1976, Mesibov was serving as Associate Editor and Don Routh began serving as Editor on the ''Journal of Pediatric Psychology'' (JPP).&lt;ref name=White&gt;White, S. (1991). A developmental history of the Society of Pediatric Psychology.  Journal of Pediatric Psychology, 16, 267-271.&lt;/ref&gt; Common topics of the JPP included chronic pain and hyperactivity.&lt;ref name=Kazak&gt;Kazak, A. E.  (2000).

From 1997 to 2007, Mesibov served as Editor for the ''Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders''. The journal, which publishes 10 issues per year, is a [[scholarly journal]] that focuses on all aspects of [[autism spectrum disorders]] and related [[developmental disabilities]].&lt;ref name=HunterBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNC-stepdown/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/psychology/child+%26+school+psychology/journal/10803?detailsPage=editorialBoard ''Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders''.] Springer, Part of Springer Science+Business Media.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9342">[[Botswana]] is experiencing one of the most severe [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] epidemics in the [[world]]. The national [[List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate|HIV prevalence rate]] among adults ages 15 to 49 is 24.8 percent, which is the third highest in the world, behind [[HIV/AIDS in Lesotho|Lesotho]] and [[HIV/AIDS in Swaziland|Swaziland]].&lt;ref name=avert&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV &amp; Aids in Botswana |publisher=AVERT International HIV &amp; Aids Charity |url=http://www.avert.org/aids-botswana.htm |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV/AIDS threatens the many developmental gains Botswana has achieved since its independence in 1966, including [[economic growth]], political stability, a rise in [[life expectancy]], and the establishment of functioning public educational and health care systems.

The prevalence and impact of HIV/AIDS in Botswana is notoriously hard to estimate.  For example, it was in 2006 calculated that high HIV infection rates should cause slight annual [[population decline]].&lt;ref name=cia_gutenberg&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook 2007]] |title=Botswana |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/27348/pg27348.html |year=2007 |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However the 2011 census showed robust population growth averaging 1.9% per year since the previous census in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212100/http://www.cso.gov.bw/templates/cso/file/File/Census%202011%20Preliminary%20%20Brief%20Sept%2029%202011.pdf 2011 Population &amp; Housing Census Preliminary Results Brief]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
Botswana is in general well-equipped and with strong infrastructure to test the population for HIV, meaning the level of contamination may in fact be on par with other African nations, whilst being reported as being the nation with the second highest HIV prevalence rates in the world. The primary mode of transmission is [[heterosexual]] contact, with the [[military]] and young women at higher risk of HIV infection than other sectors of the population. Young women (ages 15–24) who have HIV in Botswana outnumber young men with HIV by more than two-to-one.&lt;ref name="avert" /&gt; The national incidence rate is 1.5 per cent, or more than 15,000 new infections per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Edwin | first =Patricia | title =Botswana falls short in AIDS fight  |publisher=MmegiOnline |date=18 October 2012 |url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&amp;aid=175&amp;dir=2012/October/Thursday18 |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV infection rates vary by geographical region: They are highest in [[city|cities]], lower in [[town|towns]], and lowest in [[village|villages]]. Extended families and communities have exhibited resourcefulness and generosity in their willingness to absorb and care for orphaned children, but this capacity is being exhausted, especially as the current generation of grandparents begins to die.&lt;ref name=us&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pepfar.gov/press/countries/profiles/116115.htm |title=2008 Country Profile: Botswana |publisher=[[U.S. State Department]] |year=2008}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the country has been somewhat effective in fighting HIV, it remains particularly prevalent in eastern regions such as [[Bobirwa]] and [[Selebi Phikwe]], where the prevalence remains as high as 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Botswana's stunning achievement against AIDS |publisher=National Public Radio |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/07/09/156375781/botswanas-stunning-achievement-against-aids |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts to control==
Following the first reported case of HIV in Botswana in 1985, the country's response was mainly focused on screening blood to eliminate the risk of transmission through [[blood transfusion|transfusion]].&lt;ref name="avert" /&gt; Public spending on tackling HIV/AIDS was minimal by today's standards and remained so until 1997. Consequently, while [[life expectancy]] in Botswana stood at 65 years in 1990, it was estimated to have fallen to 57 by 1997 and to just 35 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Botswana 2012 Global AIDS response report|publisher=UN AIDS|url = http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/knowyourresponse/countryprogressreports/2012countries/ce_BW_Narrative_Report[1].pdf |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the 2011 census life expectancy was revised upwards to 54.5 years.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook]] |title=Botswana |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bc.html |year=2014 |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the government of [[Quett Masire]] outlined a 'national vision' ([[Vision 2016, Botswana|Vision 2016]]) to outline the country's long-term aims. It stated that "By the year 2016, the spread of the HIV virus that causes AIDS will have stopped, so that there will be no new infections by the virus in that year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Vision 2016|publisher=Botswana National Vision Council|url = http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/knowyourresponse/countryprogressreports/2012countries/ce_BW_Narrative_Report[1].pdf|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, the government has been significantly more proactive in combating the epidemic. Under the governments of [[Festus Mogae]], a programme was introduced in 1999 for the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT). In August 2000, the [[Gates Foundation]], with the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] AIDS Initiative and the pharmaceutical companies [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] and [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], started an HIV/AIDS treatment program, working with the government. The program's target was to treat every citizen of Botswana infected with HIV/AIDS. In addition, [[anti-retrovirals]] (ARVs) would be given out to those who were at an advanced stage of the disease. However, Botswana lacked adequate health-care workers and a stable medical infrastructure to implement the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Laurie|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=Jan–Feb 2007|volume=86|issue=1|pages=14–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the government introduced the first National Strategic Framework against AIDS. In 2004, with adult HIV prevalence at nearly 40 percent nationwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Hope Out of Pain: Botswana's AIDS story|publisher=BBC|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3889205.stm|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government introduced routine HIV testing for citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Progress Report of the National Response to the 2011 Declaration of the Commitments on HIV and AIDS|publisher=National AIDS Coordinating Agency|url = http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/knowyourresponse/countryprogressreports/2012countries/ce_BW_Narrative_Report[1].pdf|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, spending on Botswana's response to HIV/AIDS had risen to [[USD|US$]]340 million, of which approximately two-thirds was provided by Botswana's central government (a significantly higher proportion than in other sub-Saharan nations).&lt;ref name="avert" /&gt;

In 2011, the Ministry of [[Education in Botswana|Education]] introduced new HIV/AIDS education technology for schools. The TeachAIDS prevention software, developed at [[Stanford University]], was distributed to every primary, secondary, and tertiary educational institution in the country, reaching all learners from 6 to 24 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UNICEF funds TeachAIDS work in Botswana|url=http://teachaids.org/blog/unicef-funds-teachaids-work-in-botswana/|work=TeachAIDS|date=2 June 2010|accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that these policies are having some impact, for example HIV prevalence among 15- to 19-year-olds fell from 24.7 percent in 2001 to 13.2 percent in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Country spotlight Botswana: 'the AIDS response has been catalytic in strengthening our health system'|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2010/september/20100921fsmdgbotswanaqa/|publisher=UN AIDS|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the household level, families face increasing health expenditures to meet the needs of family members with HIV/AIDS. At the same time, they are experiencing loss of income as productive family members become sick and die.

Botswana's [[workforce]] is being depleted as many productive adults develop AIDS and are no longer able to work. According to the US State Department, between 1999 and 2005 Botswana lost approximately 17 percent of its health care workforce due to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pepfar.gov/documents/organization/101652.pdf | title=2007 Country Profile: Botswana}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2020, it has been projected that the loss in agricultural labour force due to AIDS could be more than 23 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y8331e/y8331e05.htm|title=The impact of HIV/AIDS on agriculture and food security|website=www.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Green was orphaned at a young age and raised by her aunt and uncle in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="Root"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2016/01/a_story_of_perseverance_hadiyah_nicole_green_shares_her_path_to_earning/|title=A Story of Perseverance: Hadiyah-Nicole Green Shares Her Path to a Million-Dollar Research Grant|date=January 9, 2016|work=The Root|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first in her family to attend college.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|last=Al Elliott|title=SOLE and Dr. Hadiyah-Nicole Green|date=2016-07-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSk1PXQy-Jo|accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her high school graduation, Green attended a summer program in computer science at [[Xavier University of Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She then attended [[Alabama A&amp;M University]] with a full scholarship, where she studied physics and earned her bachelor's degree in physics and optics in 2003.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dr. Hadiyah-Nicole Green2|url = http://www.tuskegee.edu/academics/colleges/ceps/ceps_special_programs/phd_program_in_materials_science_engineering/facultystaff/dr_hadiyah-nicole_green2.aspx|website = www.tuskegee.edu|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her experiences at Xavier and Alabama A&amp;M led her to become a strong advocate for [[Historically black colleges and universities|HBCU]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s because it gave herself a chance to get to know herself and develop as her own person.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Green continued her education at the University of Alabama Birmingham with another full scholarship, where she earned her Master of Science in physics in 2009 and her Ph.D. in physics in 2012.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She spent five years at Comprehensive Cancer Center, and one year at the Department of Pathology. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSk1PXQy-Jo] &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Career and research ==
Between her undergraduate and graduate work, Green's aunt, Ora Lee, was diagnosed with cancer, but refused to go through treatment. Green spent about three months taking care of her aunt until she died. However, her uncle, General Lee Smith, was also diagnosed with cancer three months after her aunt's death. While tending to her uncle, Green watched as her uncle suffered from the side-effects of chemotherapy and radiation, which, to her, seemed little better than what her aunt went through.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These experiences led to Green's interest in developing new cancer treatments. She realized the impact of chemotherapy on the body and wanted to find a better treatment for it. 

It was after an internship at NASA that Green realized that lasers were capable of so much more and significant to cancer research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helmer|first1=Lauren|title=Dr. Hadiyah-Nicole Green: FACES of the South|url=https://styleblueprint.com/everyday/dr-hadiyah-nicole-green-faces/|website=StyleBlueprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wanted to use her background in lasers to target cancerous cells without hurting healthy cells. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STEM Gem Changing the Cancer Game: Dr. Hadiyah-Nicole Green|url=http://stemgemsbook.com/stem-gem-changing-the-cancer-game-dr-hadiyah-nicole-green/|website=STEM Gems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, lasers are used to "illuminate" the nanoparticles so that they luminesce in order to create an image of cancerous cells and decrease the amount of time it takes to target these cells.&lt;ref name="Newsone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Doctor Pioneers Groundbreaking Cancer Treatment|url=https://newsone.com/3531006/black-doctor-pioneers-groundbreaking-cancer-treatment/|website=News One|accessdate=6 October 2017|date=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Floyd|first1=Safon|title=Dr. Hadiyah-Nicole Green Sprinkles Black Girl Magic on Cancer Research|url=http://www.blackenterprise.com/news/dr-hadiyah-nicole-green-sprinkles-black-girl-magic-on-cancer-research/|website=www.blackenterprise.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While conducting her doctoral research, Green was a member of a team that developed a laboratory method to insert nanoparticles into cancer cells while avoiding surrounding healthy cells. The tissue incorporating the nanoparticles heats up due to directed laser radiation, which then destroys the cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1155/2011/631753 | volume=2011 | title=Gold Nanorod Bioconjugates for Active Tumor Targeting and Photothermal Therapy | journal=Journal of Nanotechnology | pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She first tested her ideas with cancer cells in a petri dish, then moved on to small animal models using mice. However much more research is needed to be able to extend this nanoparticle treatment to whole animals and then humans. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bama|first1=East Texas|title=Hadiyah-Nicole Green seeks support for BioTech cancer hack to see light of day|url=https://rollingout.com/2016/09/09/hadiyah-nicole-green-seeks-support-for-biotech-cancer-hack-to-see-light-of-day/|website=Rolling Out|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/noinclude&gt;[[File:Istanbul Memorial Hastanesi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A hospital in [[İstanbul]]]]
'''Health care in [[Turkey]]''' consists of a mix of public and private health services. Turkey has [[universal health care]] under its Universal Health Insurance (''Genel Sağlık Sigortası'') system. Under this system, all residents registered with the [[Social Security Institution]] (SGK) can receive medical treatment free of charge in hospitals contracted to the SGK.&lt;ref name="angloinfo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/turkey/how-to/page/turkey-healthcare-health-system-health-insurance|title=The Health Insurance System in Turkey|website=Angloinfo|publisher=[[Angloinfo]]|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage==
Due to major health reforms in the 2000s and 2010s, universal health insurance coverage for the population was achieved, and the general quality of health services improved greatly, with patient satisfaction rising from 39.5% in 2003 to 75.9% in 2011.&lt;ref name="nejm.org"/&gt;

The following medical treatments are covered by the SGK:&lt;ref name=angloinfo/&gt;

* Emergencies
* Work accidents and vocational illnesses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Öztaş|first=Dilek|last2=Kurt|first2=Burak|last3=Koç|first3=Ayşegül|last4=Akbaba|first4=Muhsin|date=2018-07-03|title=Living Conditions, Access to Healthcare Services, and Occupational Health and Safety Conditions of Migrant Seasonal Agricultural Workers in the Çukurova Region|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2018.1470048|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=262–269|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1470048|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Infectious diseases
* Preventive health services (drug and alcohol abuse)
* Childbirth
* Extraordinary events (injuries from war and natural disasters)
* Fertility treatment for women younger than 39
* Cosmetic surgery deemed medically necessary

While some SGK-contracted hospitals offer dental care, in most cases, patients must rely on private dental services and are responsible for covering the costs. In addition, patients must partially cover the cost of some prescription drugs and outpatient services.&lt;ref name=angloinfo/&gt;&lt;ref name="nejm.org"&gt;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1410433&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private healthcare==
There is also a large private healthcare sector. Private health services often offer shorter waiting lists and higher quality services. Most banks and insurance companies offer health plans, and contract with certain hospitals and doctors.&lt;ref name=angloinfo/&gt;

The Turkish healthcare system used to be dominated by a centralized state system run by the Ministry of Health. In 2003 the governing [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] introduced a sweeping health reform program aimed at increasing the ratio of private to state health provision and making health care available to a larger share of the population. Information from the [[Turkish Statistical Institute]] states that 76.3 billion [[Turkish lira|liras]] are being spent on healthcare annually, with 79.6% of funding coming from the [[Sosyal Güvenlik Kurumu|Social Security Institute]] and most of the remainder (15.4%) coming from out-of-pocket payments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/24892271.asp&lt;/ref&gt; There are 27.954 medical institutions, 1.7 doctor for every 1000 people&lt;ref&gt;"Physicians (per 1,000 People)." Physicians (per 1,000 People). World Bank, n.d. Web. 19 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and 2.54 beds for 1000 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tuik.gov.tr/UstMenu.do?metod=temelist&lt;/ref&gt;

Private healthcare has increased in Turkey in the last decade due to the long queues and personal service in state-run hospitals. Most private hospitals have contracts with various insurance companies so it is now possible to receive treatment that varies from the state. After rising competition from private hospitals, there has been an increase in the quality of state hospitals. At 7.6% of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2005, Turkey’s public expenditure on national health was below average than that of the developed countries, although the percentage has increased steadily since 2000. In the early 2000s, about 63 percent of health expenditures came from public sources. In 2006 there was one doctor for every 700 people, one nurse for every 580 people, and one hospital bed for every 380 people. The rural population is poorly served by the health care system, which is much more developed in the western half of the country. Between 80 and 90 percent of the population, including self-employed workers, have health care provided by the national pension system, but are often drawn to private health providers in urban areas due to the higher-quality care. Although the private [[health industry]] has grown rapidly since the 1990s, only about 2% of the population, mainly in urban areas, has private [[health insurance]]. In 2005 about 75 percent of private health expenditures were out-of-pocket rather than being covered by insurance.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/cs/profiles/Turkey.pdf Turkey country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (August 2008). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey had a scheme called green card (Yeşil Kart), which was developed in order to help low-income social group to get medical help. Spending on this system were equal to 40 billion TL in 2010. Due to this fact, the system was reformed in 2011 and the number of people who could benefit from this system was reduced. Following the 2012 Universal Health Insurance Law, the Green Card system was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eniyihekim.com/blog|title=Blog Eniyihekim|language=tr|publisher=Eniyihekim|accessdate=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.valueinhealthjournal.com/article/S1098-3015(14)02905-2/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finance==
Turkey had the lowest expenditure on healthcare in Europe in 2015 - 6.4% of [[Gross domestic product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Dorling|first2=Danny|last3=Hennig|first3=Benjamin|title=The Human Atlas of Europe|date=2017|publisher=Policy Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781447313540|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this group of patients, heroin assisted treatment has proven superior in improving their social and health situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17602126 | doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.106.026112 | volume=191 | title=Heroin-assisted treatment for opioid dependence: randomised controlled trial |date=July 2007 | journal=Br J Psychiatry | pages=55–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown to save money, as it significantly reduces costs incurred by trials, incarceration, health interventions and [[wikt:delinquency|delinquency]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/ille-e/presentation-e/ucht-e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It has also drastically reduced overdose deaths in the countries utilizing it, as patients take their dose in a controlled, professionally supervised setting, and Narcan ([[naloxone]]) is on hand in the case of an accidental overdose.

== History ==
The British have had [[Rolleston Committee|system of heroin maintenance since the 1920s]]. For decades it supplied a few hundred addicts nationwide, most of whom were doctors themselves. It was de-emphasized considerably during the 1960s-1980s as a result of the U.S. led "[[war on drugs]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Following a sharp rise in the number of UK heroin addicts on record, and reports of cavalier prescription by doctors, the Second Brain Report is commissioned and concludes that tighter restrictions are needed." [http://www.tdpf.org.uk/Policy_Timeline.htm Transform: A History of Drug Prohibition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707011855/http://www.tdpf.org.uk/Policy_Timeline.htm |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the lack of large-scale trials, only anecdotal evidence existed as to the efficacy of the treatment. This changed in 1994 when Switzerland, faced with one of the largest open drug scenes in Europe at the time, started large-scale trials on the potential use of [[diamorphine]] as a maintenance drug. They proved diamorphine to be a viable maintenance drug which has shown equal or better rates of success than [[methadone]] in terms of assisting long-term users establish stable, crime-free lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18422829 | doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02185.x | volume=103 | issue=6 | title=Long-term effects of heroin-assisted treatment in Germany |date=June 2008 | journal=Addiction | pages=960–6; discussion 967–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results encouraged countries like [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] to conduct their own trials and finally to include heroin assisted treatment fully as a part of the national health system in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_154996_EN_Heroin%2520Insight.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the British have begun moving towards the inclusion of heroin maintenance programs as a legitimate component of their [[National Health Service]]. In 2013 European Union's European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction issued guidelines for the years 2013-2020; for the first time since the EMCDDA's 1995 inception, the group advocated "reducing the health and social risks and harms caused by drugs" in addition to longstanding policies of lessening demand and supply. Both the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] and the [[Transnational Institute]] have released documents advocating harm-reduction strategies, though only the latter mentions heroin-assisted therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.unodc.org/ddt-training/treatment/VOLUME%20D/Topic%204/1.VolD_Topic4_Harm_Reduction.pdf|title = Reducing the harm of Drug Use and Dependence|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Decriminalise drugs to meet users' right to good health, says UN official - United Nations Drug Control|url = http://www.undrugcontrol.info/en/newsroom/latest-news/item/6664-decriminalise-drugs-to-meet-users-right-to-good-health-says-un-official|website = www.undrugcontrol.info|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the right-wing [[Swiss People's Party]] initiated a national referendum on heroin-assisted treatment. A significant majority (approximately 68%) voted in favor of continuing Swiss HAT programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldradio.ch/wrs/news/video/switzerland-embraces-heroin-assisted-treatment.shtml Switzerland embraces heroin-assisted treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313010024/http://worldradio.ch/wrs/news/video/switzerland-embraces-heroin-assisted-treatment.shtml |date=2012-03-13 }} World Radio Switzerland, Tuesday, 10 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In the [[Netherlands]], both injectable Diamorphine HCl as injectable salt in dry ampoules as well as Heroin base with 5-10% caffeine for vaporization are available, both are to be taken twice daily in a supervised setting and will be accompanied with a daily take home dosage of methadone for the evening.

In [[Switzerland]] patients may be allowed to appear only once a day and receive part of their diamorphine in pill form for oral consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss_news/Without_the_heroin_programme_I_d_probably_be_dead_.html?cid=37819830#comments37819830 ‘Without the heroin programme I’d probably be dead’] swissinifo.ch, January 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This is possible only after a six-month period and is usually granted only if necessary to hold down a job.

== Criticism ==

Critics, such as the [[Drug Free America Foundation]], have criticized heroin assisted treatment along with other [[harm reduction]] strategies for allegedly creating the perception that certain behaviors can be partaken safely, such as illicit drug use, claiming that this may lead to an increase in that behavior by people who would otherwise be deterred.

{{"|We oppose so-called `harm reduction´ strategies as endpoints that promote the false notion that there are safe or responsible ways to use drugs. That is, strategies in which the primary goal is to enable drug users to maintain addictive, destructive, and compulsive behavior by misleading users about some drug risks while ignoring others.|"Statement on so-called 'Harm Reduction' policies" made at a conference in Brussels, Belgium by members of the International Task Force on Strategic Drug Policy (not a United Nations entity)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itfsdp.org/pdfs/hrstatementbrussels.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Such shortcomings arguably exist with some "harm reduction" measures, such as [[supervised injection facilities]]. These facilities provide users with the information and equipment necessary to avoid infection with diseases such as [[HIV]], but leave them dependent on the [[black market]]. So users still face the health risk associated with the injection of impure street drugs and they still face the enormous financial strain of financing their addiction.

In the case of heroin-assisted treatment however, users are provided with a form of pharmaceutical-grade heroin injection solution which doctors consider fit for injection. And as doctors refrain from drastic changes in dose and provide post-injection monitoring, overdoses are rare and can be quickly treated with [[opioid antagonist]]s like [[naloxone]]. Thus, patients in heroin-assisted treatment are relieved from the major complex of problems that defines illicit heroin use. Synthetic heroin taken under the aforementioned conditions is not neurotoxic and has few long-term side effects beside [[constipation]] and [[Substance dependence|dependency]].&lt;ref&gt;Merck Manual of Home Health Handbook - 2nd edition, 2003, p. 2097&lt;/ref&gt; And while it had been speculated that the availability of such treatment options might change public perception of the risks associated with drug use and might lead to an increase in illicit drug use, the incidence of heroin abuse in Switzerland has declined sharply since the introduction of heroin assisted treatment. As a study published in [[The Lancet]] concluded:

{{"|The harm reduction policy of Switzerland and its emphasis on the medicalisation of the heroin problem seems to have contributed to the image of heroin as unattractive for young people."| Nordt, Carlos, and Rudolf Stohler, "Incidence of Heroin Use in Zurich, Switzerland: A Treatment Case Register Analysis"&lt;ref&gt;The Lancet, Vol. 367, June 3, 2006, p. 1830.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

Also, the notion that patients in heroin assisted treatment are enabled to maintain "destructive behavior" contradicts the findings that patients significantly recover in terms of both their social and health situation. A clinical follow-up report on the German "Heroin studie" found that 40% of all patients and 68% of those able to work had found employment after four years of treatment. Some even started a family after years of homelessness and delinquency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heroinstudie.de/H-Bericht_FU.pdf Follow-up report on the german pilot study "Heroin-assisted treatment of opiate dependent patients"] page 9f&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of home health care software was in the 1990s, with companies making software based on the [[CoreOS|Omaha system]] of software.&lt;ref name=HabdookJBarlet&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Marilyn|title=Handbook of Home Health Care Administration|date=2010|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=9780763755829}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first software was made available for public health departments, nurse-managed centers, and community clinics.&lt;ref name=HabdookJBarlet/&gt; The use of home health care software increased with the technologies of cloud computing, [[telehealth]] and business analytical tools. Implementing these technologies with home health software is attributed to the enhancement of quality care at home, and reduction of fraud. During the early stages of 2000s, the home health care software industry expanded from simple databases to agencies being able to transmit electronic health records.&lt;ref name=HabdookJBarlet/&gt; There was also an increase in the available types of software as a result of software vendors working directly with health care providers.&lt;ref name=HabdookJBarlet/&gt;

==Types of software==

There are clinical and non-clinical applications of home health care software. Including types such as agency software, hospice solutions, clinical management systems, telehealth solutions, and electronic visit verification. Depending on the type of software used, companies can track health care employee visits to patients, verify payroll, and document patient care.&lt;ref name=AxxessOW5Facts&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawson|first1=Lisa|title=Five Facts about Electronic Visit Verification for Home Health Agencies|url=http://www.axxess.com/blog/news_n_update/five-facts-about-electronic-visit-verification-evv-for-home-health-agencies/|accessdate=3 April 2015|publisher=Axxess official website|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments can also use home health care software to verify visits from providers who bill them for services.&lt;ref name=AxxessOW5Facts/&gt; Use of some software is mandated by government agencies such as OASIS assessment information that must be transmitted electronically by home health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brunsberg|first1=Sarah|title=The Home Health Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS)|url=http://www.resdac.org/resconnect/articles/129|accessdate=5 April 2015|publisher=Research Data Assistance Center|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agency software===

Agency software is used by home health care providers for office use and is a subset of [[medical practice management software]] used by inpatient clinics and doctors offices. Agency software is used for billing, paying vendors, staff scheduling, and maintaining records associated with the business.&lt;ref name=EnSYouwn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Charlene|title=Start Your Own Senior Services Business: Adult Day-Care, Relocation Service, Home-Care, Transportation Service, Concierge, Travel Service|date=2014|publisher=Entrepreneur Press|isbn=9781599185415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agency software can be standalone or part of software packages, that include electronic visit verification to track hours of employees and time spent on home visits and patient care. Agency software can be purchased or leased through various vendors.&lt;ref name=EnSYouwn/&gt;

===Electronic visit verification===
{{main|Electronic visit verification}}

Electronic visit verification (often referred to as EVV) is a method used to verify home healthcare visits to ensure patients are not neglected and to cut down on fraudulently documented home visits. EVV monitors locations of caregivers, and is mandated by certain states, including [[Texas]] and [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name=IWeekGPSCuts/&gt; Other states do not mandate it, but use it as part of its Medicaid fraud oversight, created by the passing of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=GTechExpansion&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Susan|title=Medicaid Expansion Spurs States to Fight Fraud, Overpayments|url=http://www.govtech.com/federal/Medicaid-Expansion-Spurs-States-to-Fight-Fraud-Overpayments.html|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=Government Technology|date=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also widely used by employers of home healthcare providers to verify employee's locations and hours of work as well as document patient care.&lt;ref name="AxxessOW5Facts"/&gt;

===Outcome and assessment information set (OASIS)===

Home health care providers that participate in Medicaid are required to report specific data about patient care known as Outcome and Assessment Information Set-C (OASIS-C).&lt;ref name=Comparihim&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peden|first1=Ann|title=Comparative Health Information Management|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781133708124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data includes health status, functional status, and support system information. The data is used to establish a measurement of patient home health care options.&lt;ref name=Comparihim/&gt; Home health care software allows health care providers to obtain and transmit such data while on location with a patient. Data collection is mandated by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]], a division of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref name=Comparihim/&gt; Software for collecting and transmitting data is free through CMM and can also be purchased through private vendors as an add-on to other home health care software.&lt;ref name=Comparihim/&gt;

== Software Delivery Platforms ==

=== On-Site Server Based Model ===
The software is hosted on [[Server (computing)|servers]] located and maintained on-site at the agency. The localization of the data provides the agency direct access to the computers hosting their software and may also require the agency to maintain the technology that hosts the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://datasoftlogic.com/home-health-software/best-practices-for-evaluating-home-health-software|title=Home Health Software Buyer's Guide {{!}} Data Soft Logic|website=Data Soft Logic|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cloud Based Software Model ===
The software is deployed on a [[Cloud computing|cloud]] system maintained by the software vendor. The off-site maintenance of the cloud system results in a lower cost to the home health agency and provides access to the agency's data from off-site locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.capterra.com/comparing-emr-software-must-have-features/|title=Comparing EMR Software: 9 Must-Have Features - Capterra Blog|website=blog.capterra.com|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hughes–Stovin syndrome''' is a rare [[autoimmune disorder]] of unknown cause that is characterized by the combination of multiple [[lung|pulmonary]] [[artery]] [[aneurysm]]s and [[deep vein thrombosis]]. It is named after the two British [[physician]]s, [[John Patterson Hughes]] and [[Peter George Ingle Stovin]], who first described it in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=JP |last2=Stovin |first2=PG |title=Segmental pulmonary artery aneurysms with peripheral venous thrombosis. |journal=British Journal of Diseases of the Chest |date=January 1959 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=19-27 |doi=10.1016/S0007-0971(59)80106-6 |pmid=13618502}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a rare variant of [[Behçet's disease]], which entails more general problems with the circulatory system. Most patients are young adult males between the age of 20–40.
Common clinical presentations include [[fever]], cough, [[dyspnea]] and [[hemoptysis]]. [[radiology|Radiological]] features are similar to those of Behçet's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medcyclopaedia.com/library/topics/volume_v_1/h/hughes_stovin_syndrome.aspx|title=Hughes stovin syndrome|publisher=[[General Electric|GE]]|work=Medcyclopaedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no satisfactory treatment for this disease.

He is noted for his research in the fields of [[child development]] and [[family studies]]. He was a founding investigator of the [[NICHD]] Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development in the [[United States]], and of the National Evaluation of [[Sure Start]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://humandevelopment.ucdavis.edu/people/jay-belsky |title=Jay Belsky  |website=Human Development Graduate Group |language=en |access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been an [[ISI Highly Cited Researcher]] since 2002.&lt;ref name="waimh"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.waimh2018.org/skeakers-biographies/ |title=Jay Belsky  |website=WAIMH 2018 |language=en-GB |access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After receiving his Ph.D. from [[Cornell University]] in 1978, Belsky joined the faculty of [[Penn State University]], where he became a distinguished professor of human development before leaving the faculty there in 1999. From 1999 to 2010, he was a professor of psychology at [[Birkbeck University of London]], where he was also the founding director of the Institute for the Study of Children, Families and Social Issues. He became the Robert M. and Natalie Reid Dorn Professor of Human Development at the University of California, Davis in 2011. Since 2010, he has been a member of the [[Academy of Europe]].&lt;ref name=waimh/&gt;

==Research==
Belsky has published multiple studies reporting that [[child care]] is associated with an increased risk of psychological and behavioral problems for children. These studies have been covered extensively by the media,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2001/04/26/belsky |title=Jay Belsky doesn’t play well with others |last=Sweeney |first=Jennifer Foote |date=2001-04-26 |website=Salon |language=en |access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Shell |first=Ellen Ruppel |date=1988-08-01 |title=Babes in Day Care |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/88aug/babe.htm |magazine=The Atlantic |access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they have been criticized by some other researchers. One such critic, Kathleen McCartney of the [[University of New Hampshire]], said in 1987 that "None of the studies Jay [Belsky] talks about look at the quality of child-care arrangements or the family backgrounds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/25/us/day-care-for-infants-debate-turns-to-long-term-effects.html |title=Day Care for Infants: Debate Turns to Long-Term Effects |last=Collins |first=Glenn |date=1987-11-25 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-09-28 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly as a result of the controversy provoked by a study he published in 1986, he later left the United States to work in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/02/nurseries-childcare-pre-school-cortisol |title=The great nursery debate |last=Gentleman |first=Amelia |date=2010-10-01 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-09-28 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''John E. Fogarty International Center''' was founded in 1968 by US President [[Lyndon Johnson]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] to support international medical and behavioral research and to train international researchers.

==History==
On July 1, 1968 President [[Lyndon Johnson]] issued an Executive Order establishing the [[John E. Fogarty]] International Center for Advanced Study in the Health Sciences at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) in order to support international medical and behavioral research and to train international researchers..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fogarty International Center|url=http://www.fic.nih.gov/|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, the [[Trump Administration]] proposed cuts to the NIH budget, including elimination of the Fogarty Center, saving $69 million.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. McNeil Jr. [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/health/global-health-fogarty-international-center-viruses.html Trump Plan Eliminates a Global Sentinel Against Disease, Experts Warn ] New York Times, 17 March 2017, retrieved 12 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2355">The term '''Lourdes effect''' has been coined by the Belgian [[philosopher]] and [[skeptic]] [[Etienne Vermeersch]] to account for the observation that some [[supernatural]] powers seem to have a sort of resistance to manifesting themselves in a completely unambiguous fashion. According to Vermeersch, should the miraculous power of [[Lourdes]] actually exist there would be no reason to think that it would be more difficult for the [[Virgin Mary]] or [[God]] to reattach a severed arm than to cure paralysis or [[blindness]]. According to Vermeersch, the visions and photos of, for instance, the [[Loch Ness Monster]] and the [[Yeti]] lack reliability and clarity due to a similar effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etiennevermeersch.be/artikels/pseudo_wet/wetenschappelijke-aprioris-tegen-het-paranormale ''Scientific apriori's against the paranormal''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619054947/http://www.etiennevermeersch.be/artikels/pseudo_wet/wetenschappelijke-aprioris-tegen-het-paranormale |date=2009-06-19 }} by Prof. Etienne Vermeersch.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vermeersch, E., ''Het paranormale ter discussie'', Studiumgenerale, nr 9107, [[Utrecht University]], 1992, pp. 81-93 (English title: ''The paranormal questioned'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vermeersch, E., ''Epistemologische Inleiding tot een Wetenschap van de Mens'', Brugge, De Tempel, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermeersch uses this term to mock what he calls the selective and uncritical approach to [[miracles]], or the frivolous attribution of supernatural gifts to human beings. Skeptics note that the number of fatal accidents that occur on the way to and from Lourdes may well be considerably higher than the 67 alleged miracles due to faith healing recognized in 2005 by the [[Holy See|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?articleID=gn2pdd21''Lourdes needs a miracle''] - interview with prof.

Abatement cost is the cost of reducing environmental negatives such as pollution. Marginal cost is an economic concept that measures the cost of an additional unit. The '''marginal abatement cost''' ('''MAC'''), in general, measures the cost of reducing one more unit of pollution.

Although marginal abatement costs can be negative, such as when the low carbon option is cheaper than the business-as-usual option, MACs often rise steeply as more pollution is reduced.

Marginal abatement costs are typically used on a '''marginal abatement cost curve''' (MACC) or '''MAC curve''', which shows the marginal cost of additional reductions in pollution.

== Usage ==
Carbon traders use MAC curves to derive the supply function for modelling carbon price fundamentals. Power companies may employ MAC curves to guide their decisions about long-term capital investment strategies to select among a variety of efficiency and generation options. Economists have used MAC curves to explain the economics of interregional carbon trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/globalchange/www/MITJPSPGC_Rpt40.pdf |title=Ellerman, A.D. and Decaux, A., Analysis of post-Kyoto {{CO2}}&amp;#125; emissions trading using marginal abatement curves, 1998. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy-makers use MAC curves as [[merit order]] curves, to analyze how much abatement can be done in an economy at what cost, and where policy should be directed to achieve the emission reductions.

However, MAC curves should not be used as abatement supply curves (or [[merit order]] curves) to decide which measures to implement in order to achieve a given emission-reduction target. Indeed, the options they list would take decades to implement, and it may be optimal to implement expensive but high-potential measures before introducing cheaper measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vogt-Schilb, A. and Hallegatte, S., 2014. Marginal abatement cost curves and the optimal timing of mitigation measures. |journal=Energy Policy |volume=66|pages= 645–653 |date= |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The way that MAC curves are usually built has been criticized for lack of transparency and the poor treatment it makes of uncertainty, inter-temporal dynamics, interactions between sectors and ancillary benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Marginal abatement cost curves: a call for caution|date=|doi=10.1080/14693062.2011.582347 | volume=12|journal=Climate Policy|pages=219–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also concern regarding the biased ranking that occurs if some included options have negative costs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levihn|first=Fabian|date=2016-11-01|title=On the problem of optimizing through least cost per unit, when costs are negative: Implications for cost curves and the definition of economic efficiency|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544216312026|journal=Energy|volume=114|pages=1155–1163|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2016.08.089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Simon|date=2012-09-01|title=The ranking of negative-cost emissions reduction measures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512004843|journal=Energy Policy|series=Special Section: Frontiers of Sustainability|volume=48|pages=430–438|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2012.05.071}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=D.

==Examples of existing MAC curves==
Various economists, research organizations, and consultancies have produced MAC curves. Bloomberg New Energy Finance&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbon.newenergyfinance.com/download.php?n=BBNEF_CarbonMarkets_NAmerica_RN_2010_01_RN_USMACC.pdf&amp;f=fileName&amp;t=NCF_downloads Bloomberg New Energy Finance, US Marginal Abatement Cost Curve, 2010]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[McKinsey &amp; Company]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/ccsi/greenhousegas.asp McKinsey &amp; Company, Reducing US greenhouse gas emissions: how much at what cost? 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; have produced economy wide analyses on greenhouse gas emissions reductions for the [[United States]]. [[ICF International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-500-2005-121/CEC-500-2005-121.PDF |title=ICF International, Emission reduction opportunities for non-{{CO2}}&amp;#125; greenhouse gases in California, 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced a California specific curve following [[AB-32]] legislation as have Sweeney and Weyant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/group/peec/cgi-bin/docs/policy/research/September%2027%202008%20Discussion%20Draft%20-%20Analysis%20of%20Measures%20to%20Meet%20the%20Requirements%20of%20Californias%20Assembly%20Bill%2032.pdf Sweeney, J. and Weyant, J., Analysis of measures to meet the requirements of California’s Assembly Bill 32, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy]] produced several marginal abatement cost curves for Germany (also called Cost Potential Curves), depending on the perspective (end-user, utilities, society).&lt;ref&gt;[http://epub.wupperinst.org/files/5015/5015_EE_EDL_en.pdf Options and Potentials for Energy End-use Efficiency and Energy Services, Wuppertal Institute, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] has done work on a MAC curve for non carbon dioxide emissions such as methane, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and HFCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/economics/international.html |title=EPA, Global mitigation of non-{{CO2}}&amp;#125; greenhouse gases, 2006 |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enerdata and LEPII-CNRS (France) produce MAC curves with the [[Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems]] (POLES) model for the 6 [[Kyoto Protocol]] gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/energy-advisory/forecasting/mac-curves-methodology.php |title=Enerdata, Production of MAC curves by sector and by country, 2015 |publisher=Enerdata.net |date= |accessdate=2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These curves have been used for various public and private actors either to assess carbon policies &lt;ref&gt;Impacts of Multi-gas Strategies for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Abatement: Insights from a Partial Equilibirum Model, Criqui P., Russ P., Deybe D., in The Energy Journal, Special Issue: Multi-Greenhouse Gas Mitigation and Climate Policy, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; or through the use of a carbon market analysis tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/solutions/energy-models/aspen-model.php |title=Enerdata, Use of MACCs for carbon markets analysis, 2015 |publisher=Enerdata.net |date= |accessdate=2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Max Brödel''' (June 8, 1870 – October 26, 1941) was a medical illustrator. Born in Leipzig, Germany, he began his artistic career after graduating from the Leipzig Academy of Fine Arts, working for Dr. Carl Ludwig. Under Dr. Carl Ludwig's instruction, he gained a basic knowledge of medicine and became recognized for his detailed medical illustrations. In the late 1890s, he was brought to the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] in Baltimore to illustrate for [[Harvey Cushing]], [[William Stewart Halsted|William Halsted]], [[Howard Atwood Kelly|Howard Kelly]], and other notable clinicians. In addition to being an prolific medical illustrator, he developed new artistic techniques such as the [[carbon dust|carbon dust technique]] that helped the advancement of the quality and accuracy of medical illustrations for physicians. In 1911, he presided over the creation of the first Department of Art as Applied to Medicine; located at the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], it continues to train medical illustrators to this day. His graduates spread out across the world, and have founded a number of [[Medical illustration programs|other academic programs]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Max Brödel was born on June 8, 1870 in Leipzig, Germany, to Louis Brödel and Henrietta Frenzel Brödel. From the early age of 6, he took piano lessons and by 12, he was playing [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]. Not only was he musically inclined, he was also artistically inclined. At age 15, Brödel began to develop his artistic abilities at the Leipzig Academy of Fine Arts. The artistic techniques he learned there reflected the 19th century arts education emphasis on the development of fine, precise drawings.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.med.uottawa.ca/historyofmedicine/hetenyi/pace.html|title=Max Brodel (1870-1941): His Artistic Influence on Surgical Learning at Johns Hopkins Medical School|last=Medicine|first=Faculty of|website=www.med.uottawa.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meticulous attention to detail and accuracy was one of the skills that Brödel was later praised for in his medical illustrations. Over the summers, he put his artistic skills to use with part-time jobs drawing landscapes and figures. Brödel was 18 when he had his first experience with medical illustrations, which he would make his lifelong career.

=== Personal life ===

==== Marriage and family ====
Max Brödel was introduced to fellow artist, medical illustrator, and future wife, Ruth Huntington, by Dr. Howard Kelly. An artist as well, Ruth also received Franklin P. Malls' invitation and had begun illustrating for Dr. Charles Bardeen as part of the Hopkins Anatomy Department in 1900.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullen|first=Thomas S.|date=2017-04-23|title=Max Brödel, 1870-1941 Director of the First Department of Art as Applied to Medicine in the World|pmc=200894|journal=Bulletin of the Medical Library Association|volume=33|issue=1|pages=4.1–29|issn=0025-7338}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair realized their similar musical and artistic interests and married shortly afterwards on December 31, 1902. They had four children together: Elizabeth (born October 9, 1903), Ruth (born April 23, 1905), Carl (born June 7, 1908), and Elsa (born February 8, 1911). Ruth suffered from scarlet fever as a child and died on June 1, 1908.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Max Brödel: The Man Who Put Art Into Medicine|last=Crosby|first=Ranice|publisher=Springer|year=1991|isbn=0-387-97563-2|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth later followed her father's foosteps and became a medical illustrator.

He was known for his jovial, fun-loving personality, he was a close friend of H.L. Mencken and regular at the Saturday Night Club, where he frequented to drink and enjoy himself.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.magazine.jhu.edu/2011/08/max-brodel/|title=Max Brodel|work=Johns Hopkins Magazine|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his free time, he enjoyed fishing and playing the piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Max Brödel, 1870-1941, Director of the First Department of Art as Applied to Medicine in the World|last=Cullen|first=Thomas|publisher=Bulletin of the Medical Library Association|year=1945|isbn=|location=|pages=|pmc=200894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of his profession, he also occasionally made drawings from nature.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Early career ==
Despite his minimal scientific background and lack of medical knowledge, Brödel and his artistic potential were well received by esteemed German physician and physiologist, [[Carl Ludwig]]. Under Ludwig’s mentorship and guidance at the Anatomical Institute at the Institute of Physiology at the University of Leipzig, Brödel was employed with drawing detailed gross anatomical and histological diagrams. Honing his observational skills with detailed notes of the numerous surgeries and autopsies he observed, Brödel’s work was credited for topographical accuracy, tissue realism, and attention to the cross-sectional anatomy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Another noticeable feature of his illustrations was the aerial perspective that showed the anatomy as seen through a surgeon's eyes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1938-03-12|title=MAX BRODEL AND MEDICAL ILLUSTRATION|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/280405|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|language=en|volume=110|issue=11|doi=10.1001/jama.1938.02790110043013|issn=0002-9955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his early illustrations were also for physicians Spalteholz, His and Braune.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His network of medical professionals increased when he met Dr. [[Franklin P. Mall]] of [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in 1888.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Brödel's artistic career was briefly suspended when he was drafted to serve two years on November 8, 1890.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Through the auspices of Geheimrat [[Carl Ludwig II, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg|Carl Ludwig]], Prince George of Saxony, Brödel served his first year with arms, and the second year with artistic pursuits for the regiment. Upon return to Leipzig after his service, Brödel continued his work as a free-lance artist, specializing in anatomical and scientific illustrations. During this time, Brödel accepted Mall's invitation to illustrate at Johns Hopkins Hospital.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Career at Johns Hopkins University ==
Brödel arrived at Johns Hopkins in the winter of January 18, 1894. Highly sought after by anatomist Franklin P. Mall and other physicians for his meticulous attention to detail and realism in his medical illustrations, Brödel's skills were a valuable asset to the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Shortly after his employment, Brödel was joined by fellow medical illustrators, Hermann Becker and August Horn, both of whom had also attended the Leipzig Academy of Fine Arts. Working in conjunction with these two artists, Brödel created an extensive catalog of gross and histological diagrams for the medical staff.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Work with Dr. Howard Kelly ===
The majority of Brödel's illustrations were for Dr. [[Howard Atwood Kelly|Howard A. Kelly]] (1858-1943), the Chief of Gynecology, during his employment at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Brödel illustrated for Kelly's two-volume textbook, ''Operative Gynecology,'' which was published in 1898. Its release garnered widespread praise and recognition, cemented Kelly's preeminent status in the field of gynecology, and established Brödel's role as a pioneering medical illustrator.  Brödel then went on to work on other books authored or co-authored by Kelly, including those on diseases of the kidneys, ureters and bladder, as well as Kelly’s journal articles and monographs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Throughout the illustrative process, Brödel worked closely with Kelly, conferring with each other before the first sketch was drawn. After debriefing, with Kelly, Brödel painstakingly conducted independent medical research and experimented to find the best method to communicate information about complex structures to medical professionals.

Brödel's underlying artistic philosophy is best described in his own words: “The artist must first fully comprehend the subject matter from every standpoint: anatomical, topographical, histological, pathological, medical, and surgical. From this accumulated knowledge grows a mental picture from which again crystallizes the plan for the future drawing. A clear and vivid mental picture must always precede the actual picture on paper.The planning of the picture, therefore, is the all important thing, not the execution.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His emphasis on anatomically accurate visualization prior to artistic actualization was manifested in his incredibly lifelike renderings.

The seamless translation of medical knowledge into his illustrations is credited with his strong investigative drive. Brödel understood the essential role medical illustrations played in teaching medical students the complexities and functions of anatomical structures, and was therefore keen on educating himself by poring over  medical texts, attending lectures, and disseecting cadavers.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.med.uottawa.ca/historyofmedicine/hetenyi/pace.html|title=Max Brodel (1870-1941): His Artistic Influence on Surgical Learning at Johns Hopkins Medical School|last=Medicine|first=Faculty of|website=www.med.uottawa.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other medical fields he worked extensively in are [[Otolaryngology]] and [[Urology]].&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
[[File:Urinary System Illustration.jpg|alt=Bladder and urethra musculature|thumb|Illustration of the musculature of bladder and urethra by Brödel]]

=== Setbacks ===
On March 24, 1899, Max Brödel was diagnosed with a [[Rheumatic fever|streptococcus infection]] on his hand and arm, caused by improper practice of handling anatomical dissections without gloves.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He required several operations on his left arm, including one to separate nerve fibers from the scar tissue. These operations were performed by Dr. [[William S. Halsted]], Chief of Surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Capitalizing on this experience, Brödel illustrated and detailed his medical condition and the resulting numbness of his nondominant left hand. Despite encouragement by Halsted, these drawings remained unpublished.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In December 1904, Brödel sustained severe injuries to the middle finger of his right hand. Another Johns Hopkins physician, Dr. [[John Miller Turpin Finney]], was able to help recover normal functioning, allowing Brödel to continue his artistic and musical pursuits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== War years ===
With the onset of [[World War I]], Brödel experienced alienation and disillusion living amongst anti-German sentiment in the United States along with his mother’s declining health back in Germany. Henriette Brödel would end up dying November 2, 1915 and Max would become more introverted as the years went on, realizing he had overestimated the amount of importance and growth his medical illustration training program was to receive, expecting it to grow in stature in ways it never did.

Max’s program was to be plagued by low student enrollment during the war years and the persistent troubles of meager compensation in the profession of [[medical illustration]], with two of his pupils turning down offers to work with Brödel’s former colleague [[Harvey Cushing]], now at [[Harvard Medical School]], over the issue of salary.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Famous works and techniques ===

==== Carbon dust technique ====
[[File:Thyroidectomy Illustration.jpg|alt=Thyroidectomy procedure - surgical anatomy|thumb|Surgical anatomy pertaining to a [[thyroidectomy]] procedure demonstrating the carbon dust technique by Max Brödel]]
Max Brödel is credited with the development of the [[carbon dust]] technique for medical and scientific illustrations. He had been looking for an acceptable medium able to show the vividness and detail characteristic of living tissue, and made the breakthrough using clay-surfaced lithographic transfer paper.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Using a wide variety of media, realistic multi-dimensional representations of complex anatomical structures are able to be constructed. The dust is made by shaving carbon pencils against abrasive surfaces, and then applying this fine dust onto textured, calcium-coated paper with dry brushes. Increasing the depth and dimension of the image, the carbon dust technique was able to add highlights, shadows, and texture to Brödel's work. Due to the limitations of the black and white printing era, the relative ease of reprinting artwork created with carbon dust made this a highly suitable technique for a wide variety of scientific illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41168198|title=The Guild handbook of scientific illustration|last=1937-2006.|first=Hodges, Elaine R. S.,|last2=(U.S.)|first2=Guild of Natural Science Illustrators|date=1989-01-01|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780471288961|oclc=41168198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popularized in the 1900s, this method is still used today because of its ability to capture a remarkable amount of fine visual detail.

=== Department of Art as Applied to Medicine ===
In 1910, Brödel received an inviting offer for a position at the [[Mayo Clinic]]. Gynecologist and close friend of Brödel, Dr. [[Thomas S. Cullen]], began raising funds for a department where Brödel could remain content at Johns Hopkins and train the next generation of medical illustrators with the necessary skills and background.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Henry Walters]], a Baltimore financier, philanthropist and art collector, agreed to fund the creation of this endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Max Brödel and visual communication: The effect of the Hopkins intellectual context in the genesis of modern medical illustration|last=Melloni|first=Ida Dox|publisher=UMI|year=1990|isbn=|location=University of Maryland College Park|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1911, Brödel became the inaugural director for the Department of Art as Applied to Medicine at Johns Hopkins. His goal was to train medical illustrators to work in conjunction with physicians to increase understanding of how the body works. The program was the first of its kind, and attracted both medical and art students from all around the world.

In an article published in the September 1911 edition of The Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin, Brödel laid out his case for the creation of the department. “Its purpose,” he wrote, “is to bridge over the gap existing between art and medicine, and to train a new generation of artists to illustrate medical journals and books in the future and

to spare them the years of trial and disappointment of their self-taught predecessors.”&lt;ref&gt;Johns Hopkins Hospital. Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Baltimore: The Hospital, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brödel headed the department until 1939.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Death ===
Max Brödel died on October 26, 1941 of [[pancreatic cancer]] in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; Approximately two months before he passed away, Brödel published a paper in ''the Journal of the American Medical Association'' titled "Medical Illustration." This provided a first-hand account and insight into his long illustrative career.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Department of Art as Applied to Medicine ===
Brödel not only leaves behind a massive collection of medical illustrations, his carbon dust technique is still employed today, and the Department of Art as Applied to Medicine is still recognized for their excellence in visual communication in science and medicine. Many former students at the Department of Art as Applied to Medicine would later make up a large percentage of the founding members of the Association of Medical Illustrators, which began in 1945.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Several notable artists who were heavily influenced by Brödel include the following.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Elizabeth Brödel of the Woman's Clinic in the New York Hospital
* James F. Didusch of the Department of Embryology in the Carnegie Institution
* Dorcas Hager Padget of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
* Willard C. Shepard of Chicago
* Leon Schlossberg of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
Institutions that have been influenced by Brödel’s work in medical illustrations include the Wilmer, Brady, Mayo and Lahey clinics, the American Museum of Natural History, and Yale, Minnesota, Rochester, Toronto and Tulane Universities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Johns Hopkins Hospital     ===
In 1938, a portrait of Max Brödel by artist Thomas C. Corner, was presented and displayed in the halls of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine alongside portraits of medical pioneers, [[William Osler]], [[William Stewart Halsted|Wiliam Stewart Halsted]], [[Howard Atwood Kelly]], and [[William H. Welch]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This display of recognition was initiated by the vice president of the [[Saunders (imprint)|W.B. Saunders]] medical publishing company, Mr. R.W. Greene.

=== Brödel Archives ===
The majority of Brödel's illustrations and his uncompleted manuscript are housed in the Brödel archives located at the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Visitors and researchers are allowed to reproduce a selection of his works with special permission. All of Brödel's work for Dr. Kelly and Dr. [[Thomas Stephen Cullen|Thomas S. Cullen]] are numbered from 1 to 989.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7645">The '''National Irrigation Commission Limited''' (NIC), was established in 1986 and became operational in May 1987. The NIC obtains its authority from the [[Irrigation Amendment Act]] (1999). The chief role of the NIC is to provide [[irrigation]] services to the [[agricultural sector]]. NIC’s mission is ‘to develop potential sources of irrigation water, and to manage these together with existing resources, by the provision of effective and efficient delivery systems up to farm-gate, geared towards the enhancement of [[Jamaica]]’s [[agricultural development]]’. Under the Irrigation Act, the Commission will furnish and maintain efficient irrigation systems throughout the declared irrigation areas in accordance with reasonable standards of dependability as required in irrigation operations.The NIC is also responsible for keeping the [[Black River (Jamaica)|Black River]] navigable and other selected watercourses clear in order to minimise [[flooding]] in that area. The NIC also takes necessary precautions to avoid flooding at all times.

== NIC’S Water Supply Standards ==
The NIC is mandated to maintain the water courses under its control at a standard to ensure that its clients obtain their supplies at an acceptable quality. The following are the main requirements for the NIC to adequately maintain its irrigation systems:

Keep watercourses clean and clear or remove from such water courses inclusive of the banks,any vegetation including trees,logs, refuse, soil or any obstacle which may obstruct or impede the natural flow of water and possibly cause flooding of adjacent areas.
Refuse removed from the canals by the NIC must be placed on land adjacent to the watercourse but not beyond a distance of one chain measured from the top of the banks thereof.
Keep clean and free from obstruction such drains as may be deemed necessary for the proper drainage of such land.
Trim trees or shrubbery which may overhang, endanger or interfere with any irrigation works.
From time to time, the NIC may construct, lay and maintain road or open spaces within the irrigation districts.

== Service Standards Observed ==
The following standards are observed:

Process duly completed applications within four (4) weeks of receipt at the District Office.
Offer simultaneous readings (i.e. joint reading) of measuring devices. Customers who do not participate must recognize that the Commission’s readings will prevail.
Make customers’ bills available within eight (8) days after billing period.
Reconnect customers for the non-payment of bills within seventy- two (72) hours of payment of both the bill and the re-connection fee.
Address requests for adjustments to water supply (i.e.turn on/off of supplies) by contracted customers within twenty-four (24) hours.
Maintain standards of operational efficiency which will help to keep irrigation rate charges to a minimum.

== Irrigable Areas in Jamaica ==
Out of the approximately 90,000 that are considered irrigable in Jamaica, almost 36,000 have some sort of irrigation infrastructure installed, but only some 25,000 ha are currently irrigated. Almost 55% of the irrigated area is in public irrigation systems, administered by the National Irrigation Commission (NIC). Irrigation is mainly supplementary and most of the Island’s agricultural lands are cultivated under rain fed conditions. However, some specific areas with good soils and topographical conditions for intensive agriculture are highly dependent upon irrigation. According to the Land and Water Atlas of Jamaica produced by the National Irrigation Development Master Plan, rainfall regimes make irrigation a necessity for intensive agriculture in the South/Central Region of the Island (mainly covering some parts of the Parishes of [[St Elizabeth, Jamaica|St Elizabeth]], [[Manchester Parish|Manchester]], [[Clarendon Parish, Jamaica|Clarendon]], [[St. Catherine Parish|St. Catherine]], [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|St. Andrew]] and an isolated part of [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica|St. Thomas]]). Indeed, it is there, where most of the current irrigation infrastructure of the Island is located and where most of the proposed projects to be developed by the Master Plan were identified.

== Future Role of the NIC ==
In view of the progressive establishment of WUAs, NIC will shift gradually towards planning, monitoring and some regulating functions, during NIDP implementation. These functions will concern technical and organizational issues and the regulatory ones related to tariffs will follow the process described in paragraph 1.15. National Irrigation Development Plan

The [[North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest]] ([[Site of Special Scientific Interest|SSSI]]) is an internationally important protected area in [[Norfolk]], England. The SSSI is a long, narrow strip of coastal land that starts between [[Old Hunstanton]] and [[Holme-next-the-Sea]], and runs east for about 43&amp;nbsp;km (27&amp;nbsp;mi) to [[Kelling]]. The southern boundary runs roughly west to east except where it detours around towns and villages, and never crosses the [[A149 road|A149 coast road]].&lt;ref name=sssimap&gt;{{cite web| author =| title =North Norfolk Coast SSSI| work =Nature on the map| url =http://www.natureonthemap.naturalengland.org.uk/map.aspx?map=sssi&amp;feature=1001342,sssi,HYPERLINK,LABEL| publisher =Natural England| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://archive.is/20121224041333/http://www.natureonthemap.naturalengland.org.uk/map.aspx?map=sssi&amp;feature=1001342,sssi,HYPERLINK,LABEL| archivedate =2012-12-24| df =}} Retrieved 23 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It has an area of 7,700&amp;nbsp;ha (19,027&amp;nbsp;acres), and is additionally protected through [[Natura 2000]], [[Special Protection Area]] (SPA) and [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] listings; it is also part of the [[Norfolk Coast AONB|Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB).&lt;ref name=encitation&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=North Norfolk Coast |work=SSSI citations |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001342.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Natural England |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AxoEYZ20?url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001342.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-26 |df= }} Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = aonb&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Other conservation designations within the AONB | work= Norfolk Coast AONB Management Plan 2009-14 | url= http://www.norfolkcoastaonb.org.uk/mediaps/pdfuploads/pd001159.pdf  |format = PDF | publisher= Norfolk Coast Partnership}} Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scolt Head Island]] and the coast from the [[Holkham National Nature Reserve]] to [[Salthouse]] are a [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves|Biosphere Reserve]].&lt;ref name =liley4&gt;Liley (2008) pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Norfolk Coast SSSI contains a variety of habitats including foreshore, [[shingle beach|shingle]],  [[salt marsh]]es, [[reed bed]] and pasture, and is important primarily for the  breeding populations of nationally and internationally scarce bird species, and also the large numbers of [[wildfowl]] it supports in winter. More than three-quarters of the SSSI has been acquired as [[nature reserve]]s by [[conservation movement|conservation]] organisations, whose properties also hold several rare or endangered [[invertebrate]]s and plants. The mixed pattern of ownership of the ten reserves existing in 2012 reflects the availability of land for purchase or management over the preceding century, and the differing priorities of the various bodies.

==Overview==
The North Norfolk Coast SSSI was created in 1986 from prexisting SSSIs at [[Blakeney Point]], [[Holme Dunes]], [[Cley Marshes]], [[Salthouse Marshes]] (all designated in 1954), [[Morston|Morston Saltmarshes]], [[Brancaster Manor]] (1968), [[Stiffkey|Stiffkey Saltmarshes ]] (1969), [[Thornham, Norfolk|Thornham Marshes]] (1972) and [[Titchwell Marsh]] (1973), together with the [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|national nature reserve]]s (NNRs) at [[Scolt Head Island]] and Holkham, and substantial formerly undesignated areas. It has a wide variety of habitats. Bare mud, sand and shingle characterise the [[intertidal zone]] along the whole of the coast, although higher areas may have [[algae]] or [[Zostera marina|eelgrass]] that are grazed by ducks and geese in winter. The salt marshes which form on sheltered parts of the coast, in the lee of islands, or behind [[spit (landform)|spits]] are described in the SSSI notification document as "among the best in Europe&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;flora is exceptionally diverse". Sand [[dune]]s occur at several places along the coast, but the best examples are at Holme Dunes, Holkham, Blakeney Point, and Scolt Head Island. The latter two sites are also important for [[geomorphology]] research purposes as structures consisting mainly of shingle ridges. Reed beds are fairly localised, but substantial areas occur at Titchwell Marsh, Brancaster and Cley Marshes. Grassland is represented by [[livestock]] grazing [[pasture]] reclaimed from former salt marsh, with wetter areas at Cley and Salthouse marshes. Woodland is limited in the SSSI, although a belt of [[Pinus nigra|Corsican pine]] planted at Holkham has provided shelter to allow other trees and shrubs to become established.&lt;ref name = encitation/&gt;

The SSSI is designated as a Special Protection Area for birds because its variety of coastal habitats give it year-round importance for a number of species. The breeding colonies of [[Sandwich tern]]s and [[little tern]]s, especially those at Blakeney and Scolt Head Island,&lt;ref name = blakeneypoint&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Blakeney Point National Nature Reserve | work= | url= http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/Blakeneypoint_tcm6-22495.pdf |format = PDF | publisher= Natural England }} Retrieved 14 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = scolt&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Scolt Head Island NNR | work= | url=http://www.naturalengland.org/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nnr/1006129.aspx | publisher= Natural England}} Retrieved 14 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; are of  European importance, and the coast is of national significance for [[common tern]]s, [[pied avocet]]s and reed bed specialists like [[western marsh harrier]]s, [[Eurasian bittern]]s and [[bearded reedling]]s.&lt;ref name = encitation/&gt; The SSSI also holds large numbers of wintering ducks and geese,&lt;ref name = harrup&gt;Harrup &amp; Redman (2010) pp. 233–250.&lt;/ref&gt; the endangered [[European water vole|water vole]],&lt;ref name=pennine&gt;{{cite web| author =| title =Water voles in the North Pennines| work =| url =http://www.northpennines.org.uk/Lists/DocumentLibrary/Attachments/156//Watervoles.pdf| format =PDF| publisher =North Pennines AONB Partnership| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140729202427/http://www.northpennines.org.uk/Lists/DocumentLibrary/Attachments/156//Watervoles.pdf| archivedate =2014-07-29| df =}} Retrieved 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ratty&gt;{{cite web| author= | title= Water Vole| work= Species leaflet| url= http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/Documents/Species-Leaflets/WF_Water_Vole.pdf| format= PDF| publisher= Norfolk Wildlife Trust| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/69mesck2K?url=http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/Documents/Species-Leaflets/WF_Water_Vole.pdf| archivedate= 2012-08-09| df= }} Retrieved 28 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and scarce species like [[natterjack toad]],&lt;ref name= holkham&gt;Natural England (2009) pp. 7–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = natter&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Natterjack toad ''Bufo calamita''| work= Wildlife in Norfolk | url=http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/Wildlife-in-Norfolk/Species/Amphibians-and-Reptiles/Natterjack-toad.aspx|publisher= Norfolk Wildlife Trust}} Retrieved 14 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[starlet sea anemone]], [[Centaurium pulchellum|lesser centaury]], [[Hordeum marinum|sea barley]]&lt;ref name= dear&gt;Norfolk Wildlife Trust (2005) pp. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]].&lt;ref name=holhdunes&gt;{{cite web | author=  | title= Dunes | work= Holkham National Nature Reserve | url= http://www.holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/dunes.html | publisher= Holkham Estate | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121215095447/http://www.holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/dunes.html | archivedate= 2012-12-15 | df=  }} Retrieved 18 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the wildlife importance of the area, much of what is now the SSSI has been protected in [[nature reserve]]s, starting in 1912 when [[Charles Rothschild]] bought Blakeney Point and donated it to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], which has managed it since.&lt;ref name = blakeneypoint/&gt; A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites (Snettisham, Titchwell, Holkham, Morston Quay, Blakeney and Cley) found that 39&amp;nbsp;per cent of visitors gave [[birdwatching]] as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7&amp;nbsp;million day visitors and 5.5&amp;nbsp;million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent [[pound sterling|£]]122&amp;nbsp;million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Titchwell Marsh ([[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]]), Cley Marshes ([[Norfolk Wildlife Trust]]) and Holkham National Nature Reserve each attract 100,000 or more visitors annually.&lt;ref name =liley4/&gt; The SSSI ownership outside the listed areas is a mixture of private land and areas owned by the National Trust or wildfowling associations which are not actively managed as nature reserves.&lt;ref name = encitation/&gt;&lt;ref name= ryan&gt;Ryan (1969) p 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = shoot&gt;{{Cite news | last = Finch | first = Will | title = Kent wildfowlers buy up north Norfolk marshland  | newspaper = Shooting Times | location = London | pages = | publisher = IPC Media Ltd| date =21 January 2011 | url = http://www.shootingtimes.co.uk/news/513516/Kent_wildfowlers_buy_up_north_Norfolk_marshland.html }} Retrieved 1 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reserves ==
The ten reserves existing in 2012 had a combined area of 6,016&amp;nbsp;ha (14,863&amp;nbsp;acres), 78&amp;nbsp;percent of the SSSI. Although they have no legal protection beyond that of privately owned land, they may have more active management or provide visitor facilities. The mixed ownership reflects land becoming available for purchase or management at various times, and the differing priorities of the conservation bodies.&lt;ref name = natenghome&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Reserves | work= | url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nnr/default.aspx | publisher=Natural England }} Retrieved 9 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nwthome&gt;{{cite web|author= |title=Reserves |work= |url=http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/Wildlife-in-Norfolk/Reserves.aspx |publisher=Norfolk Wildlife Trust |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614224837/http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/Wildlife-in-Norfolk/Reserves.aspx |archivedate=2012-06-14 |df= }} Retrieved 9 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = rspbmain&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Our work | work= | url = http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/ | publisher= Royal Society for the Protection of Birds}} Retrieved 9 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicorette''' is the brand name of a number of products for [[nicotine replacement therapy]] (NRT) that contain [[nicotine]]. Developed in the late 1970s in [[Sweden]] by {{Interlanguage link multi|AB Leo|sv|3=Leo Läkemedel AB}} in the form of a chewing gum, Nicorette was the first nicotine replacement product on the market.&lt;ref name="inmemo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treatobacco.net/en/uploads/documents/Other%20Documents/In%20memory%20of%20Ove%20Ferno%20SRNT%20Newsletter%202008.pdf |title=In memoriam of Ove Fernö - the inventor or NRT and The Past, Present, and Future of NRT |author1=Karl Fagerstöm |author2=Anders Axelsson |author3=Lennart Sorelius |publisher=Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Newsletter, September/October 2008, vol. 14, № 3 |quote=During the late 1960s and 70s he was responsible for the development of the first NR product – a chewing gum |date= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6V54sakPw?url=http://www.treatobacco.net/en/uploads/documents/Other%20Documents/In%20memory%20of%20Ove%20Ferno%20SRNT%20Newsletter%202008.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-25 |accessdate=2014-12-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brand name "Nicorette" comes from "nicotine" and {{lang-sv|rette}}, "right way".&lt;ref name="Swedish" /&gt;

== Medical uses ==
Nicorette products are indicated for the relief of [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal symptoms]] associated with [[nicotine withdrawal]] and to aid in [[smoking cessation]].&lt;ref name="mhrapatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/l-unit1/documents/websiteresources/con036311.pdf |title=Nicorette Invisi 10 mg patch, Nicorette Invisi 15 mg patch, Nicorette Invisi 25 mg patch, PL 15513/0159-61 |date=2008-12-02 |year= |website= |series= |publisher=[[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VRov0Vk6?url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/l-unit1/documents/websiteresources/con036311.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that Nicorette products should be used in "conjunction with a behavioural support programme".&lt;ref name="mhrapatch" /&gt;

Prior to 2005 nicotine products in Britain were only licensed to "assist smokers who were making an immediate and complete quit attempt".&lt;ref name="mhrarep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/es-policy/documents/publication/con068571.pdf |title=MHRA Public Assessment Report: The use of nicotine replacement therapy to reduce harm in smokers, February 2010 |date= |year=2010 |website= |series= |publisher=[[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VRpgDPgn?url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/es-policy/documents/publication/con068571.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following advice from a working group set up by the [[Committee on Safety of Medicines]] (since 2005 the [[Commission on Human Medicines]]) the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] concluded that NRT products should be used also by those who are unable to stop abruptly.&lt;ref name="mhrarep" /&gt;

Currently Nicorette products in the UK are indicated to:
* relieve craving (the urge to smoke),
* relieve withdrawal symptoms ([[irritability]], impatience; difficulty in concentrating),
* improve the likelihood of a successful abrupt quit attempt,
* reduce the amount smoked in those not immediately motivated to quit.&lt;ref name="mhrarep" /&gt;

The products are intended for adults and children over 12 years of age as well as pregnant and lactating women&lt;ref name="mhragum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/l-unit1/documents/websiteresources/con2024562.pdf |title=Nicorette Peppermint 2 and 4 mg gum, Nicorette Ice Mint 2 and 4 mg gum, Nicorette Spearmint 2 and 4 mg gum, PL 15513/0136-7, PL 15513/0143-4, PL 15513/0152-3 |date=2006-07-18 |website= |series= |publisher=[[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VRs0AJVx?url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/l-unit1/documents/websiteresources/con2024562.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (it has been concluded that "the use of NRT in pregnancy does not give undue concern and any harm caused by nicotine replacement must be compared with that caused by continued smoking – which is extremely harmful to both the woman and her child".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/pl-a/documents/websiteresources/con2023239.pdf|title=Report of the Committee on Safety of Medicines Working Group on Nicotine Replacement Therapy, November 2005|date=|year=2005|website=|series=|publisher=[[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]]|location=|page=|pages=|accessdate=2015-01-09|quote=|ref=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214073332/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/pl-a/documents/websiteresources/con2023239.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  

Nicorette, like all other NRT products,  are most beneficial for heavy smokers (more than 15 cigarettes per day). There are not enough studies to show that NRT helps those who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicotine replacement therapy|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007438.htm|author=David C. Dugdale, III|website=MedlinePlus|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150109145356/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007438.htm|archivedate=2015-01-09|accessdate=2015-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contraindications ==
The typical contraindication (reason to not use) for Nicorette products is hypersensitivity to nicotine.&lt;ref name="mhrapatch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mhragum" /&gt;

Up until recently [[cardiovascular disease]] was considered to be a contraindication to nicotine replacement therapy products. However, in 2003 the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products ([[Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé|AFSSAPS]]) removed all cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease contraindications. In 2005 the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency followed suit. The rationale is that the benefit of nicotine replacement therapy outweighs the risks of nicotine medication, even in smokers with cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treatobacco.net/en/page_75.php |title=Nicotine is not a significant risk factor for cardiovascular events. The benefit of nicotine replacement therapy outweighs the risks of nicotine medication, even in smokers with cardiovascular disease |date=2014-12-16 |year= |website= |series= |publisher=The Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VS8mg6s8?url=http://www.treatobacco.net/en/page_75.php |archivedate=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] stated that the contraindication concerning usage of NRT products while smoking is no longer valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm345087.htm |title=Nicotine Replacement Therapy Labels May Change |date=2013-04-01 |year= |website= |series= |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VS9Rf1u1?url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm345087.htm |archivedate=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA approved [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]] for Nicorette products with a warning concerning [[pregnancy]] and [[breastfeeding]]: "This medicine is believed to be safer than smoking. However, the risks to your child from this medicine are not fully known".&lt;ref name="fdagum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/018612Orig1s074,%20020066Orig1s055lbl.pdf |title=Nicorette, Nicotine Polacrilex, Labeling Revision  10/30/2014 |date=2014-10-30 |year= |website= |series= |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VSDayYiZ?url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/018612Orig1s074,%20020066Orig1s055lbl.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA suggests not using Nicorette products if the patient continues to smoke, or use chewing tobacco, snuff or other nicotine-containing products.&lt;ref name="fdagum" /&gt;

The FDA advises consulting a doctor before using the product if the patient previously had:
* heart disease, recent heart attack, or irregular heartbeat,
* high blood pressure,
* taken a prescription medicine for depression or asthma.
Specific contraindications listed by the FDA for various formats include sodium-restricted diet, stomach ulcer of diabetes (for gums&lt;ref name="fdagum" /&gt; and lozenges), or an allergy to adhesive tape or skin problems (for patches).&lt;ref name="fdapatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/020165Orig1s029lbl.pdf |title=Nicoderm, Labeling Revision  10/30/2014 |date=2014-04-30 |year= |website= |series= |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VSF7rGmn?url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/020165Orig1s029lbl.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA suggests stopping use of Nicorette products in cases of irregular heartbeat or palpitations, symptoms of nicotine overdose ([[nausea]], [[vomiting]], dizziness, weakness, and rapid heartbeat)&lt;ref name="fdagum" /&gt; or skin redness caused by the patch.&lt;ref name="fdapatch" /&gt;

== Formats ==

=== Gum ===

Nicorette chewing gum releases nicotine while chewing. Nicotine then is absorbed across the [[oral mucosa]] into the [[systemic circulation]]. Patients are advised to chew the gum slowly and intermittently to avoid the risk of releasing too much nicotine. It is also suggested not to eat or drink while chewing since foods and beverages can reduce nicotine absorption.&lt;ref name="lehne"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Burchum|first1=Jacqueline|last2= Rosenthal|first2=Laura|year=2014|chapter=Chapter 39: Drug Abuse III: Nicotine and Smoking |title= Lehne's Pharmacology for Nursing Care|edition=|page=427|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=0323340261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7_NBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA427&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-01-18}}(Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicorette chewing gum is available in two strengths: 2&amp;nbsp;mg/piece and 4&amp;nbsp;mg/piece. Dosing would depend on the degree of nicotine dependence: light smokers should use 2&amp;nbsp;mg gum, heavy smokers (more than 25 cigarettes a day) should use 4&amp;nbsp;mg gum.&lt;ref name="lehne" /&gt;
Patients should chew gum once they feel the craving. The average adult dosage is 9 to 12 pieces per day.&lt;ref name="lehne" /&gt; FDA limits maximum daily amount of 2&amp;nbsp;mg gums to 24 pieces.&lt;ref name="fdagum" /&gt;

It is suggested to use gum following a 12-week schedule, reducing the amount of gums consumed by the end of the therapy.&lt;ref name="fdagum" /&gt;

=== Patch ===
The patches provide slow absorption of nicotine into blood within the day and work for 16 hours.&lt;ref name="rutter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rutter|first=Paul| year=2013|chapter=Nicorette |title= Community Pharmacy: Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment|edition=3|page=320|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=0702054739|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_mI_n3y5koC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-01-18}}(Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually applied in the morning and removed at bedtime.

The patch supports smoking cessation within 12 week programme: 25&amp;nbsp;mg patch (25&amp;nbsp;mg nicotine over 16 hours) for eight weeks (Step 1), 15&amp;nbsp;mg patch for two weeks (Step 2), 10&amp;nbsp;mg patch for the last two weeks (Step 3). Light smokers (less than 10 cigarettes per day) were recommended to start at Step 2 (15&amp;nbsp;mg) for eight weeks and reduce the dose to 10&amp;nbsp;mg for the last four weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mims.co.uk/more/NewDrugs/article/892146/New-high-strength-nicotine-patch/ |title=New high-strength nicotine patch |date=2009-02-24 |year= |website= |series= |publisher=[[Monthly Index of Medical Specialities]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VECO3ecd?url=http://m.mims.co.uk/article/892146/new-high-strength-nicotine-patch |archivedate=2014-12-31 |accessdate=2014-12-31 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microtab ===
Microtab supplies nicotine to the body by mouth. It is different from the chewing gum because instead of chewing the patient should allow the tablet to dissolve slowly under the tongue (the tablet dissolves in about 20-30 [[minute]]s).&lt;ref name="stop"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willis|first=Nicola| year=2012|chapter=Which Treatment?|title=Stop! No Smoking Programme |edition=|page=69|publisher=Random House|isbn=1448148952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action is similar to 2&amp;nbsp;mg nicotine gum.&lt;ref name="stop" /&gt;

Microtabs are used either for smoking cessation or smoking reduction. For smoking cessation the standard dose is one tablet (2&amp;nbsp;mg) per hour for patients who smoke less than 20 cigarettes per day.

== History ==

=== Nicotine gum ===

The Nicorette brand started with a [[nicotine chewing gum]] developed in [[Helsingborg]] ([[Sweden]]) by the company Leo AB, later part of [[Pharmacia|Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn]]. It was the first product for [[nicotine replacement therapy]]&lt;ref name="inmemo" /&gt; and gained its inventor, Ove Fernö, titles like "the founding father of modern pharmacotherapy for smoking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=West|first=Robert|editor1-last=Edwards|editor1-first= Griffith|date=|year=2008|chapter=Pillars of Smoke|title= Addiction: Evolution of a Specialist Field |edition=1st|page=231| publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=1405147504|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eNdhgma5KpwC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-01-05}}(Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his colleague Stefan Lichtneckert noted how submariners and aviation crews switched from [[cigarette]]s to [[chewing tobacco]] and [[snus]] when smoking was not possible. They also suggested the product name "Nicorette".&lt;ref name="Swedish"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larsson|first1=Bengt|last2=Letell|first2=Martin|last3= Thörn|first3=Håkan|year=2012|chapter=9.5 The rise of medicinal nicotine in Sweden |title= Transformations of the Swedish Welfare State: From Social Engineering to Governance?|edition=1st|page=| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=0230363954|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fU1dAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145}} Fernö began experimenting with nicotine gum in 1969 and quit smoking himself after one year of use.&lt;ref name="wiley" /&gt;{{rp|1218}}

The first nicotine chewing gum was produced at AB Leo in 1971. The innovation was in the use of [[ion-exchange resin]] ([[Nicotine polacrilex|polacrilex]]) in order to control the rate of release of nicotine during chewing. Fernö explained, "Putting nicotine into chewing gum is not an invention. Fixing the nicotine to an ion exchange resin and putting that in a chewing gum to enable the chewer to control the rate of release—that is an invention".&lt;ref name="wiley" /&gt;{{rp|1220}} The same year Håkan Westling, Professor of Clinical Physiology at Lund University, started the first clinical trials of the gum as an aid to smoking cessation at the university hospital. His findings were presented at the Second World Conference on Smoking and Health in London&lt;ref name="Swedish" /&gt;{{rp|146}} and were published in 1973 in the journal ''Psychopharmacologia'' together with an article by Fernö.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brantmark B, Ohlin P, Westling H | date      = 1973-07-19| title     = Nicotine-containing chewing gum as an anti-smoking aid.| url       = | journal   = Psychopharmacologia| publisher = | volume    =  31| issue     = 3| pages     = 191–200| doi       = 10.1007/bf00422509| pmc       = | pmid      = 4581737}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author    = Fernö O.| date      = 1973-07-19| title     = A substitute for tobacco smoking.| url       = | journal   = Psychopharmacologia| publisher = | volume    =  31| issue     = 3| pages     = 201–204| doi       = | pmc       = | pmid      = 4732726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicotine chewing gum was presented at the Third World Conference on Smoking and Health in New York in 1975 by Fernö in partnership with the British researcher Michael Russell from the [[Institute of Psychiatry]], who pioneered the measurement of blood nicotine levels. Russell and his colleagues at the Addiction Research Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry became involved in further research into nicotine gum through randomised controlled trials funded by the British Medical Research Council and the UK [[Department of Health and Social Security]].&lt;ref name="Swedish" /&gt;{{rp|147}}

Nicorette was registered as a drug in Switzerland in 1978, in Canada in 1979, and in the UK in 1980.&lt;ref name="Swedish" /&gt;{{rp|147}} It was registered in Sweden in 1981. Initially the Swedish [[Medical Products Agency (Sweden)|Medical Products Agency]] declined to approve Nicorette as a medicine because it considered smoking not an addiction, but a lifestyle choice; and the Swedish [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] regarded orally consumed nicotine products not as medicine but as foodstuffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kalkhoff|first1=Will|last2=Thye|first2=Shane R.|last3=Lawler|first3=Edward J.|date=|year=2012|chapter=The Birth of Medicinal Nicotine|title= Critical Perspectives on Addiction |edition=1st|page=79|publisher= Emerald Group Publishing |isbn=1780529317|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WxycrG-j1UC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 1984 Nicorette chewing gum was approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] after a 34-month review. It was brought to the US market by [[Marion Merrell Dow]] under licence from AB Leo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet/46/004/merrell-dow-nicorette-antismoking-rx-chewing-gum-trade-shipments |title=Merrell Dow Nicorette Anti-Smoking Rx Chewing Gum Trade Shipments |date=1984-01-23 |year= |website= |series= |publisher=The Pink Sheet |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VNPO9iE4?url=https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet/46/004/merrell-dow-nicorette-antismoking-rx-chewing-gum-trade-shipments |archivedate=2015-01-06 |accessdate=2015-01-05 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that apparently the brand is supporting car races because NASCAR fans are heavy smokers.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;

'''Oncofertility''' is a subfield that bridges [[oncology]] and [[Reproductive health|reproductive research]] to explore and expand options for the reproductive future of [[cancer survivor]]s.  The name was coined in 2006 by [[Teresa Woodruff|Teresa K. Woodruff]] at the [[Oncofertility Consortium]].  

Cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, may destroy a person's ability to have children later in life, and oncofertility research focuses on increasing [[fertility preservation]] options. With 10% of cancer patients being younger than age 40, this issue affects more than 135,000 people in the United States each year. As cancer survivorship increases, the preservation of fertility in women, men, and children becomes a critically important topic to patients and their families. The ability to easily preserve fertility prior to cancer treatment can provide hope at the time of diagnosis for families later in life. Oncofertility also incorporates reproductive issues after cancer treatment, such as family planning, complex contraception, hormonal management throughout survivorship, [[surrogacy]], and [[adoption]].

==Fertility options for men==

Established fertility preservation options for men include [[Semen cryopreservation|sperm banking]], in which a semen sample is produced, frozen, and stored for future use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.juro.2011.10.154 |title=Improved Fertility Preservation Care for Male Patients with Cancer After Establishment of Formalized Oncofertility Program |year=2012 |last1=Sheth |first1=Kunj R. |last2=Sharma |first2=Vidit |last3=Helfand |first3=Brian T. |last4=Cashy |first4=John |last5=Smith |first5=Kristin |last6=Hedges |first6=Jason C. |last7=Köhler |first7=Tobias S. |last8=Woodruff |first8=Teresa K. |last9=Brannigan |first9=Robert E. |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=187 |issue=3 |pages=979–86 |pmid=22264454 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[testicular sperm extraction]], during which sperm is retrieved directly from the testes through a short surgical procedure and frozen. {{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Experimental options include testicular tissue banking when testicular tissue is surgically removed and frozen. Scientists are developing methods to use this tissue for fertility preservation in males. {{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Men who do not preserve their fertility prior to cancer treatment may have children through [[donor sperm]] using sperm from a known or anonymous donor to achieve a pregnancy with a female partner using assisted reproductive technologies or [[Adoption]] by permanently assuming all rights and responsibilities of a child through a legal process.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Fertility options for women==

[[File:Petefészekszövet-csíkok fagyasztva tárolása.jpg|right|thumb|Cryopreserving ovarian tissue strips]]
Options for women to have children after cancer have increased significantly in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ygyno.2010.09.012 |title=Fertility considerations in the management of gynecologic malignancies |year=2011 |last1=Noyes |first1=Nicole |last2=Knopman |first2=Jaime M. |last3=Long |first3=Kara |last4=Coletta |first4=Jaclyn M. |last5=Abu-Rustum |first5=Nadeem R. |journal=Gynecologic Oncology |volume=120 |issue=3 |pages=326–33 |pmid=20943258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women should be counseled on established options such as [[embryo banking]] in which hormonal stimulation causes the production of multiple eggs, which are removed, fertilized by sperm, and frozen for future use, and [[egg banking]] in which hormonal stimulation causes the production of multiple eggs, which are removed and frozen for storage and future use, and [[ovarian transposition]] (surgically moving the ovaries to a different part of the body) and [[Radiation shielding|ovarian shielding]] (physically shielding the ovaries from the area receiving radiation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-6518-9_31 |pmc=3071538 |isbn=978-1-4419-6517-2 |chapter=Counseling and Consenting Women with Cancer on Their Oncofertility Options: A Clinical Perspective |title=Oncofertility |series=Cancer Treatment and Research |year=2010 |last1=Jungheim |first1=Emily S. |last2=Carson |first2=Kenneth R. |last3=Brown |first3=Douglas |volume=156 |pmid=20811851 |pages=403–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Experimental techniques include [[Ovarian tissue cryopreservation|ovarian tissue banking]] in which an ovary is surgically removed and frozen to be transplanted back into the woman when she is ready to have children. Scientists are also working on ways to mature undeveloped eggs from this ovarian tissue. {{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

After sterilizing cancer treatment, a woman can also choose [[surrogacy]] (when a woman carries a pregnancy for another woman or couple) or adoption. {{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Recent efforts also investigate the implications of a cancer diagnosis during pregnancy.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Fertility options for children==

Prepubescent children have fewer options to preserve fertility than adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cncr.26045 |title=Oncofertility and preservation of reproductive capacity in children and young adults |year=2011 |last1=Wallace |first1=W. Hamish B. |journal=Cancer |volume=117 |pages=2301–10 |pmid=21523750 |issue=10 Suppl}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[testicular sperm extraction]] for males and [[Ovarian tissue cryopreservation|ovarian tissue banking]] for females.

==Financial, ethical, and legal considerations==
Fertility preservation costs may be prohibitive for young patients and multiple organizations now provide methods to reduce costs for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-6518-9_28 |pmc=3071554 |isbn=978-1-4419-6517-2 |chapter=Perspectives on Oncofertility from Demography and Economics |title=Oncofertility |series=Cancer Treatment and Research |year=2010 |last1=King |first1=Rosalind Berkowitz |volume=156 |pmid=20811848 |pages=371–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Fertile Hope]] and Fertile Action.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} 

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] addressed the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] implications of oncofertility in March 2012 with ''[[Astrue v. Capato]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Research also investigates ethical issues in oncofertility, such as the decision-making process for adolescent children and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-6518-9_33 |pmc=3086488 |isbn=978-1-4419-6517-2 |chapter=Whose Future Is It?

'''Paraneoplastic acrokeratosis''', '''Bazex syndrome''' (also known as '''acrokeratosis paraneoplastica of Bazex''' and '''acrokeratosis neoplastica''')&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P. |author2=Bolognia, Jean L. |author3=Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a cutaneous condition characterized by psoriasiform changes of hands, feet, ears, and nose, with involvement of the nails and periungual tissues being characteristic and indistinguishable from [[psoriatic nails]]. The condition is associated with carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract.&lt;ref name="Fitz2"&gt;Freedberg, et al. (2003). ''Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine''. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-138076-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|665}}

This condition should not be confused with the other unrelated disease called Bazex syndrome, otherwise referred to as [[Bazex-Dupre-Christol syndrome]].

==History==
This was first reported by the French Dermatologist, Andre Bazex (1911&amp;ndash;1988), in 1945. Contrary to some publications, he did not die in 1944, as a victim of the [[Liberation of Paris|Battle for France]], but instead, was alive and well and continued his research on skin diseases up until his retirement in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vgrd.org/archive/cases/2008/bazex/bazex%20abstract.htm | title=Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica in a 45-yr-old man | date=February 20, 2008 | author=Eric Ehrsam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4830">'''Pharmaceutical publication planning''' is the activity of planning the dissemination of scientific and clinical data on a [[drug]] to [[Health care provider#Practitioners and professionals |healthcare professional]]s at [[Congress#Scientific congress |scientific congresses]] and medical society meetings and in [[peer review]]ed [[Public health journal|medical journals]].

==Procedure==

Pharmaceutical publication planning involves developing a detailed plan that outlines the timely presentation of verified scientific and clinical data to appropriate types of healthcare professionals such as [[physician]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[nurse]]s, as a drug undergoes [[clinical trial]]s and after it is [[Marketing|marketed]]. Because of scientific and therapeutic advances, pharmaceutical publication planning has become a well-established and important function by [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] in order to educate healthcare professionals accordingly about new drugs and marketed drugs with new [[Clinical significance|clinical uses]] or [[safety]] information. 

Within pharmaceutical companies, publication planning is usually overseen by medical or clinical affairs professionals. In this effort, pharmaceutical companies frequently use the assistance of medical communication agencies with publication planning expertise and professional [[Medical writing|medical writers]].

==Medical communication agencies==

Medical communication agencies include a broad range of organizations, including those that focus largely or exclusively on publication planning. When developing and executing a publication plan on behalf of a pharmaceutical or [[biotechnology]] client, medical communication agencies employ professional publication strategists, scientific medical directors, medical writers and project managers. Working as a team, this group of individuals delves deep into their client's scientific discoveries, and propose the most effective and efficient ways to spread the word about new potential therapies to physicians and other healthcare providers. 

There has been some discussion in the [[Media (communication)|media]] regarding disclosure as it pertains to the use of [[medical writing|professional medical writers]] in this endeavor. Some agencies and professional organizations focused on publication planning have been and continue to develop and refine [[Ethics|ethical]] guidelines and standards for disclosure and transparency.

== Professional publication planning associations ==
Professional organizations for individuals involved in pharmaceutical publication planning include the [[International Society of Medical Publication Professionals]] (ISMPP) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ismpp.org|title=ISMPP Home|author=MemberClicks Admin|work=ismpp.org|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The International Publication Planning Association]] (TIPPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicationplanningassociation.org|title=Healthcare Education Associates|work=publicationplanningassociation.org|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of these organizations is to create a forum where individuals involved with pharmaceutical publication planning and [[Medical research|biomedical]] publications can meet and share knowledge and experience. They serve to promote career opportunities and [[professional development]] of individuals involved with pharmaceutical publication planning, as well as to promote standards of excellence in ethical professional medical writing and the biomedical publication process in disseminating scientific and clinical data on pharmaceutical products. 

In 2009, ISMPP began a certification program for publication planning professionals.

'''Refusal skills''' are a set of skills designed to help children avoid participating in high-risk behaviors.  Programs designed to discourage [[crime]], [[Recreational drug use|drug use]], [[violence]], and/or [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] frequently include refusal skills in their curricula to help students resist [[peer pressure]] while maintaining self-respect.  One such program is [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education]].  Programs may focus on: offering alternative activities, saying "no", being honest, and using humor.

The '''Sanctuary of Oropa''' ({{lang-it|santuario di Oropa}}), is a group of [[Roman Catholic]] buildings and structures in the municipality of [[Biella]], [[Italy]]. It is located at a height of 1,159 metres in a small valley of the [[Alpi Biellesi]].&lt;ref&gt;CTR (''Carta Tecnica Regionale'') 1:10.000, Regione Piemonte, Settore Cartografico and Settore Sistema Informativo Territoriale, 2007 [[Raster graphics|raster]] version&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Santuario di Oropa-chiesa nuova-complesso1.jpg|thumb|left|The Upper Basilica]]
According to legend, a [[black Virgin of Oropa|black wooden statue]] of the [[Virgin Mary]] carved by [[Saint Luke]] was found in [[Jerusalem]] by Saint [[Eusebius of Vercelli]] and carried to Oropa in the 4th century AD&lt;ref name = atl&gt;''The sanctuary of Oropa'', [[province of Biella]] tourist office; web page on [http://www.atl.biella.it/en/santuario-di-oropa www.atl.biella.it] (accessed in February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and placed into a small niche in a big boulder. Around that niche housing the [[Black Virgin of Oropa|statue]] in the [[Middle Ages]] was built first a church, which during the early 17th century was replaced with what is known today as the Ancient Basilica. In the following two centuries several other buildings were added to the complex, including the royal apartments of the [[House of Savoy]], a big library and the Royal Gate, a masterpiece designed by the architect [[Filippo Juvarra]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref name = atl /&gt;

The last building added to the sanctuary was the Upper Basilica, a monumental church built between 1885 and 1960 due the large number of pilgrims visiting Oropa.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the sanctuary'', official web-site [http://www.santuariodioropa.it/db/en/history-culture/history-of-the-sanctuary www.santuariodioropa.it] (accessed in February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Its dome is 80 metres high and the church can hold 3000 people.&lt;ref&gt;''Santuario diOropa (BI)'', on [http://www.camperontheroad.it/Pellegrinando/Oropa/Santuario%20di%20Oropa.pdf  www.camperontheroad.it] (accessed in February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1617, the construction of the [[Sacro Monte di Oropa]] (literally Sacred Mount of Oropa) was built not far from the sanctuary. It is a [[Catholic devotions|devotional]]  path now composed of twelve [[chapel]]s (plus another seven nearby) containing groups of statues representing scenes from the story of the [[Virgin Mary]]'s life.

Near the Sacro Monte in the 19th century was built a new graveyard, where the noble families of the Biellese territory built their family tombs. Some graves have [[free masons]] symbols, such as [[Quintino Sella]]'s one.

== Devotion and popular beliefs ==
The statue of the black Madonna has always been venerated and to the Virgin of Oropa are attributed miracles and protections. The town of Biella made a vow during the 17th-century plague and it wasn't infected. Following  this grace, the town does a pilgrimage every year to the sanctuary in order to thank the Virgin Mary.

People during the centuries made '''[[ex-voto]]''' (for grace) pictures to thank the Virgin Mary. All of these pictures are still preserved in the sanctuary in the 'ex voto gallery'. The oldest picture dates back to 1522 and was made by painter [[Bernardino Lanino]].

The popular belief says that the wooden statue has some peculiar characteristics:

== Pilgrimages ==
Around 800,000 [[pilgrim]]s and one-hundred pilgrimages visit the sanctuary each year.&lt;ref name = atl /&gt;

The evocative and ancient pilgrimage from [[Fontainemore]] to Oropa takes place every five years.

== Nature conservation ==
[[File:Funivia oropa sfondo santuario.jpg|thumb|View from the ''Oropa-lago del Mucrone'' cableway]]
The mountain area surrounding the sanctuary is included in a [[regional park]] of 1,518.28 [[hectares|ha]] (code: EUAP0882) named ''Riserva Naturale Speciale del Sacro Monte di Oropa''.&lt;ref&gt;''Riserva Naturale Speciale del Sacro Monte di Oropa'', description on [http://www.parks.it/riserva.sacro.monte.oropa/par.php www.parks.it] (accessed in February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Diversity Foundation''', also known as '''Smiles for Diversity''', is a [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit organization]] started by Dr. Dan Fischer, who was raised in the polygamous community of the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] and who is a former member of the FLDS church.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.religionnewsblog.com/11455/boulder-author-aims-to-find-sect-leader Boulder author aims to find sect leader&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Diversity Foundation is a registered [[501(c)(3)]] organization. The Foundation's mission is to strengthen and align global communities. This is accomplished by empowering vulnerable and [[underprivileged children]] with access to quality education. Through educational tools Diversity supports and encourages mindful awareness of the value of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and a respect of ethnic and [[cultural heritage]].

After the attack on a Jewish day-care center in California and the murder of gay University of Wyoming student [[Matthew Shepard]], Dan Fischer set up The Diversity Foundation to encourage [[dentists]] to promote respect for human diversity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.childbrides.org/boys_sltrib_lost_boys.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824182245/http://childbrides.org/boys_sltrib_lost_boys.html |archivedate=2007-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Diversity Foundations three-fold aim is to:

# Provide dental products to disadvantaged people
# Encourage acceptance of diversity
# Help the [[Lost Boys of Polygamy]]

Smiles for Diversity's primary method for encouraging acceptance of diversity is through the distribution of [[comic books]] and [[coloring book]]s.  Part of The Diversity Foundation's charitable mission is to provide educational materials without charge to teachers and librarians.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/11447815046798.htm Bill Galvan: From the Scrapyard to Riverdale&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190840/http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/11447815046798.htm |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The comic book is [[Scrapyard Detectives]], created by [[Bill Galvan]] and [[Chad Denton]], and was originally created as "a way for kids to get the message that being different is great, and diversity should be appreciated and celebrated.".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110933/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=005879 Comicon.Com: Galvan &amp; The Scrapyard Detectives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Diversity Foundation attempts to help the [[Lost Boys of Polygamy]] by helping the boys get schooling and even college educations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  They try to ""We try to find these kids, find them a place to live and help them with school."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  However The Diversity Foundation isn't familiar with all lost boys, because there are many who "slip through the cracks and do not get help once they leave Hildale or Colorado City. Some of them simply don't know what help is available."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,660210781,00.html Deseret Morning News | Accused man has ties to FLDS towns&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Fischer also wants to raise awareness about the Lost Boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childbrides.org/boys_LAT_lost_to_only_life_they_knew.html Lost to the Only Life They Knew&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110102610/http://www.childbrides.org/boys_LAT_lost_to_only_life_they_knew.html |date=2007-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/30/nation/na-fischer30 Los Angeles Times | Ex-polygamist Dan Fischer is a thorn in the side of FLDS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[managed care|managed medical care]] '''step therapy''' is an approach to [[medical prescription|prescription]] intended to control the costs and risks posed by [[prescription drug]]s. The practice begins [[medication]] for a medical condition with the most cost-effective drug therapy and progresses to other more costly or risky therapies only if necessary. Also called '''step protocol''' or a '''fail first requirement''', and is a type of [[prior authorization]] requirement.  

Recent trends in prescription drug prices in the United States  has led to an increased pressure on health care providers to keep down the cost of prescription medication while maintaining high levels of availability to the patient.&lt;ref&gt; Jessica S. Banthin, Peter Cunningham, and Didem M. Bernard "Financial Burden Of Health Care", 2001–2004 Health Affairs, January/February 2008; 27(1): 188-195.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[generic drugs]] when possible allows health care plans to pursue both of these goals effectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajmc.com/Article.cfm?Menu=1&amp;ID=2650 Brenda R. Motheral, PhD; Rochelle Henderson, MPA; and Emily R. Cox, PhD "Investigation showing step therapy reduces managed care costs: Plan-Sponsor Savings and Member Experience With Point-of-Service Prescription Step Therapy", The American Journal of Managed Care Volume 10:457-464 July 2004 Number 7 Pt 1]&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicians and managed care providers may disagree on the proper step therapy&lt;ref&gt;Neil J.

==Opponents==
Opponents of step therapy, such as Fail First Hurts, have detailed the pitfalls of step therapy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://failfirsthurts.org/ffh/ FailFirstHurts.org]&lt;/ref&gt; "Fail First is used by health insurers to control costs.  It is time-consuming from a physician and patient standpoint, is more expensive from a direct and indirect out-of-pocket cost perspective, denies patients the drugs they need when they need them, and allows payers to practice medicine without a license."
* Creates additional barriers leading people to forgo needed medications
* Can cause patients’ medical conditions to deteriorate, increasing the need for medical intervention in the future.  As a result, patients require increasingly costly medical care
* Increases frustration and incidents of depression
* Increases the risk of non-compliance and self-medication

A '''stock tank''' is used to provide [[drinking water]] for animals such as [[cattle]] or [[horse]]s. Stock tanks can range in size from 100 L to over 5500 L (30 to 1500 gallons) and typically are made of [[galvanized steel]]. These tanks are filled either by a pump, [[windpump]], creek, [[spring (water)|spring]], or even rely on runoff water from rain or melting snow.

There are thousands of water ponds in [[Texas]] [[rangeland]]s that locals call a "[[water tank|tank]]". When the weather is hot some people use them for swimming.

==Other uses==
Another use of a metal (or plastic) stock tank is at a [[fair]] or other event where they are filled with ice to keep canned and bottled beverages, or even perishables such as watermelons cold. Tackle shops are known to store minnows for fishing in them. A [[cowboy church]] commonly uses a stock tank for water baptisms.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Metal stock tanks have also been used as a cheap alternative for a hot tub. Various heating methods are possible, including a submersible wood stove such as the one made by [https://web.archive.org/web/20061117233925/http://snorkel.com/index.php Snorkel Stoves]. Another innovative heating solution (using a salvaged drip coffee maker) can be seen [http://www.hotspringsenthusiast.com/35Tub.asp here]

==Aquatic pets==
Stock tanks can also make perfect indoor habitats for aquatic pets, such as turtles, frogs, etc. For example, [[red eared slider]]s are a species of aquatic turtles that require at least 40 L of water per 25 mm of shell length (10 gallons per inch). Considering that these turtles can grow up to {{convert|300|mm|in}} in length, stock tanks are the perfect alternative for those who might not be able to afford a 340 - 450 L (90-120 gallon) tank to house their pet(s).

[[File:Physical examination.jpg|thumb|A medical examination]]
Some religions claim that praying for somebody who is sick can have positive effects on the health of the person being prayed for.

[[meta-study|Meta-studies]] of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is "no discernible effect" while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had "small, but significant, effect sizes" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref name=Masters /&gt;&lt;ref name=DRHodge /&gt;

==Introduction==
In comparison to other fields that have been scientifically studied, carefully monitored studies of prayer are relatively few. The field remains tiny, with about $5 million spent worldwide on such research. If and when more studies of prayer are done, the issue of prayer's efficacy may be further clarified.&lt;ref name="WashPostOne"&gt;Boorstein, Michelle. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/05/AR2008120502813.html Researchers Stepping Up Study of Health And Religiosity], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 6 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third party studies discussed here have all been performed using Christian prayers. Some have reported [[null results]], some have reported correlations between prayer and health, and some have reported contradictory results in which beneficiaries of prayer had worsened health outcomes. The parameters used within the study designs have varied, for instance, daily or weekly prayers, whether to provide patient photographs, with full or partial names, measuring levels of belief in prayer, and whether patients underwent surgery.

==Studies==

===Galton===
In 1872, the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] scientist [[Francis Galton]] made the first [[statistics|statistical analysis]] of third-party prayer. He hypothesized, partly as satire, that if prayer were effective, members of the [[British Royal Family]] would live longer than average, given that thousands prayed for their well-being every Sunday, and he prayed over randomized plots of land to see whether the plants would grow any faster, and found no correlation in either case.&lt;ref name="galton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dawkins"/&gt;

===Byrd and Harris===
A 1988 study by Randolph C. Byrd used 393 patients at the [[San Francisco General Hospital]] [[Coronary care unit|coronary care unit (CCU)]]. Measuring 29 health outcomes using three-level (good, intermediate, or bad) scoring, the prayer group suffered fewer newly diagnosed ailments on only six of them. Byrd concluded that "Based on these data there seemed to be an effect, and that effect was presumed to be beneficial", and that "intercessory prayer to the Judeo-Christian God has a beneficial therapeutic effect in patients admitted to a CCU."&lt;ref name="Byrd"/&gt; The reaction from the scientific community concerning this study was mixed. Several reviewers considered Byrd’s study to be well-designed and well-executed,&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain and Hall 2001, 34&lt;/ref&gt; while others  remained skeptical.  A criticism of Byrd's study, which also applies to most other studies, is the fact that he did not limit prayers by the friends and family of patients, hence it is unclear which prayers, if any, may have been measured.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

The Byrd study had an inconsistent pattern of only six positive outcomes amongst 26 specific problem conditions. A systematic review suggested this indicates possible [[Type I and type II errors|Type I]] errors.&lt;ref name=DRHodge /&gt;

A 1999 follow-up by William S. Harris et al. attempted to replicate Byrd's findings under stricter experimental conditions, noting that the original research was not completely blinded and was limited to only "prayer-receptive" individuals (57 of the 450 patients invited to participate in the study refused to give consent "for personal reasons or religious convictions").&lt;ref name="HarrisGowdaKolb"/&gt;  Using a different, continuous weighted scoring system – which admittedly was, like Byrd's scoring, "an unvalidated measure of CCU outcomes" – Harris et al. concluded that "supplementary, remote, blinded, intercessory prayer produced a measurable improvement in the medical outcomes of critically ill patients", and suggested that "prayer be an
effective adjunct to standard medical care."&lt;ref&gt;Harris et al. 1999, 2273&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when they applied Byrd’s scores to their data, they could not document an effect of prayer using his scoring method. Critics have suggested that both Byrd's and Harris's results can be explained by chance.&lt;ref name="Tessman"/&gt; Richard P. Sloan compared the Byrd and Harris studies with the [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy|sharpshooter fallacy]], "searching through the data until a significant effect is found, then drawing the bull's-eye."&lt;ref name="Sloan"/&gt;

===O'Laoire===
A 1997 study by O'Laoire measured the effects on the agents performing daily prayers and reported benefits not only for the beneficiaries, but also for the agents, and the benefit levels correlated with the belief levels of agents and beneficiaries in some cases. The study measured [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. This study used beneficiary names as well as photographs.&lt;ref name="OLaoire"/&gt;

===Sicher===
In 1998 Fred Sicher et al. performed a small scale double-blind randomized study of 40 patients with advanced [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sicher|first=F|author2=Targ, E|author3= Moore D, 2nd |author4=Smith, HS|title=A randomized double-blind study of the effect of distant healing in a population with advanced AIDS. Report of a small scale study.|journal=The Western Journal of Medicine|date=December 1998|volume=169|issue=6|pages=356–63|pmid=9866433|pmc=1305403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lake112 &gt;''Textbook of Integrative Mental Health Care'' by James Lake 2006 {{ISBN|1-58890-299-4}} page 112&lt;/ref&gt; The patients were in category C-3 with [[CD4]] cell counts below 200 and each had at least one case of AIDS-defining illness.&lt;ref name=Scott259 &gt;''Handbook of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Mental Health'' edited by Scott Shannon 2001 Academic Press {{ISBN|0-12-638281-6}} page 259&lt;/ref&gt; The patients were randomly assigned to receive distant intercessory healing or none at all. The intercession took place by people in different parts of the United States who never had any contact with the patients. Both patients and physicians were blind to who received or did not receive intercession.&lt;ref name=Scott259 /&gt; Six months later the prayer group had significantly fewer AIDS illnesses, less frequent doctor visits, and fewer days in the hospital.&lt;ref name=Lake112 /&gt; However, CD4 counts and scores on other [[physiology|physiological]] tests had no significant variation between the two groups of patients.&lt;ref name=Scott259 /&gt;

===Mayo clinic===
A 2001 double-blind study at the [[Mayo Clinic]] randomized 799 discharged coronary surgery patients into a [[Scientific control|control]] group and an intercessory prayer group, which received prayers at least once a week from 5 intercessors per patient. Analyzing "primary end points" (death, cardiac arrest, rehospitalization, etc.) after 26 weeks, the researchers concluded "intercessory prayer had no significant effect on medical outcomes after hospitalization in a coronary care unit."&lt;ref name="AvilesWhelanHernke"/&gt;

===The IVF-ET prayer scandal===
In 2001 the ''Journal of Reproductive Medicine'' published an experimental study by three [[Columbia University]] researchers indicating that prayer for women undergoing [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]]-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) resulted in a success rate (50%) of [[pregnancy]] double that of women who did not receive prayer.&lt;ref name="ChaWirthLobo"/&gt; [[Columbia University]] issued a news release saying that the study had been carefully designed to eliminate [[bias]].&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt;  The most vocal [[skeptic]] was [[Bruce Flamm]], a clinical professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the [[University of california|University of California at Irvine]], who found that the experimental procedures were flawed.&lt;ref name="FlammOne"/&gt;  One of the study's authors, Cha, responded to criticism of the study in the November 2004 issue of JRM.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=21868&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2001, the [[DHHS|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (DHHS)]] office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) confirmed a report by the Columbia University Health Sciences Division that one of the study’s authors, Rogerio Lobo, only learned of the study six to twelve months after the study was completed, and that he had only provided editorial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/detrm_letrs/dec01f.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The name of [[Columbia University]] and Lobo were retracted from the study.&lt;ref name="FlammThree"/&gt;

===Retroactive intercessory prayer===
A 2001 study by Leonard Leibovici used records of 3,393 patients who had developed blood infections at the [[Rabin Medical Center]] between 1990 and 1996 to study ''retroactive'' intercessory prayer.&lt;ref name="Leibovici"/&gt;  To compound the alleged miraculous power of prayer itself, the prayers were performed ''after'' the patients had already left the [[Rabin Medical Center|hospital]]. All 3,393 patients were those in the [[Rabin Medical Center|hospital]] between 1990 and 1996, and the prayers were conducted in 2000. Two of the outcomes, length of stay in the hospital and duration of fever, were found to be significantly improved in the intervention group, implying that prayer can even change events ''in the past.'' However, the "[[mortality rate]] was lower in the intervention group, but the difference between the groups was not significant."  Leibovici concluded that "Remote, retroactive intercessory prayer was associated with a shorter stay in hospital and a shorter duration of fever in patients with a bloodstream infection." Leibovici goes on to note that in the past, people knew the way to prevent diseases (he cites scurvy) without understanding why it worked.  In saying so, he suggests that if prayer truly does have a positive effect on patients in hospital, then there may be a naturalist explanation for it that we do not yet understand.  After many scientists and scholars criticized this retroactive study,&lt;ref name="Thornett"/&gt; Leibovici stated in 2002 that the "article has nothing to do with religion. I believe that prayer is a real comfort and help to a believer. I do not believe it should be tested in controlled trials."&lt;ref name = Lighthearted /&gt;  The study has been summarised as being "intended lightheartedly to illustrate the importance of asking research questions that fit with scientific models."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;

In 2003, [[Larry Dossey]], the [[executive editor]] of the journal ''[[Explore: The Journal of Science &amp; Healing]]'' and an advocate of [[faith healing]]&lt;ref name = Gorski /&gt; co-authored a paper responding to Leibovici which discussed possible mechanisms to explain the results reported.&lt;ref name = BMJ_Dossey /&gt;  Olshansky and Dossey invoked quantum mechanics to explain not only the benefits of intercessory prayer, but also how it might operate retroactively,&lt;ref name = BMJ_Dossey /&gt; drawing strong criticisms from physicist [[Victor J. Stenger|Victor Stenger]] and physician [[Jeffrey Bishop]].&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt; The [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] is regularly used to suggest that conscious control of physical reality is predicted by quantum mechanics, but this misconception "can be traced to a misinterpretation of [[particle-wave duality|wave-particle duality]]."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  In relation to [[backwards causation|backwards causality]], Stenger noted that "the results of some quantum experiments may be interpreted as evidence for events in the future affecting events in the past at the quantum level, [but] no theoretical basis exists for applying this notion on the macroscopic scale of human experience."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  He concluded that while "the atoms in biological systems are quantum in nature ... their collective behaviour does not exhibit any quantum effects. ... What is more, even if the brain were a quantum system, that would not imply that it can break the laws of physics any more than electrons or photons, which are inarguably quanta."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  One further point which illustrates that Dossey and Olshansky do not understand the physics they are using is seen in their invocation of [[quantum nonlocality]] in explaining backward causation, stating that "[r]etroactive prayer may be less absurd than [Leibovici] supposes, in the light of the discovery of non-local phenomena."&lt;ref name = BMJ_Dossey /&gt;  Unfortunately, the two are mutually incompatible: in allowing reverse causality in a model, the phenomenon of nonlocality ceases.&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  Dossey has written in ''Explore'' about coining the term "nonlocal mind" in 1987,&lt;ref name = Nonlocal /&gt; though quantum nonlocality goes back to a 1935 paper by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky|Podolsky]], and [[Nathan Rosen|Rosen]].&lt;ref name = EPR /&gt;  Olshansky and Dossey defended their work from various critics in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'s rapid response section&lt;ref name = ODrespond /&gt;

Olensky and Dossey are not alone amongst alternative medicine proponents in having missed the point which Leibovici was making.  In 2004, Stephen Wright described the Olshansky and Dossey contribution as a "thoughtful essay,"&lt;ref name = Wright /&gt; and it was praised by an editorial in the ''[[Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine]]'' the same year.&lt;ref name = Jobst /&gt;  In 2005, Olshansky and Dossey's work was included in a critical review published in ''Explore'' which concluded that "Religious activity may improve health outcomes."&lt;ref name = ExploreCritReview /&gt;  Their work was also defended in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' itself in 2004.&lt;ref name = BMJdefender /&gt;  Dossey authored an ''Explore'' paper defending experiments on the medical effects of prayer in 2005.&lt;ref name = Twenty /&gt;

===The MANTRA study===
A 2005 MANTRA (Monitoring and Actualisation of [[Noetic theory|Noetic]] Trainings) II study conducted a three-year clinical trial led by [[Duke University]] comparing intercessory prayer and MIT (Music, Imagery, and Touch) therapies for 748 cardiology patients. The study is regarded as the first time rigorous scientific protocols were applied on a large scale to assess the feasibility of intercessory prayer and other healing practices. The study produced null results and the authors concluded, "Neither masked prayer nor MIT therapy significantly improved clinical outcome after elective catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention."&lt;ref name="KrucoffCraterGallup"/&gt;  Neither study specified whether photographs were used or whether belief levels were measured in the agents or those performing the prayers.

===The STEP project===
Harvard professor [[Herbert Benson]] performed a "Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP)" in 2006.&lt;ref name="STEP"/&gt;  The STEP, commonly called the "[[Templeton Foundation]] prayer study" or "Great Prayer Experiment", used 1,802 [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] patients at six hospitals. Using [[double-blind]] protocols, patients were [[randomize]]d into three groups, individual prayer receptiveness was not measured. The members of the experimental and control Groups 1 and 2 were informed they might or might not receive prayers, and only Group 1 received prayers. Group 3, which served as a test for possible [[psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic effects]], was informed they would receive prayers and subsequently did. Unlike some other studies, STEP attempted to standardize the prayer method. Only first names and last initial for patients were provided and no photographs were supplied. The congregations of three [[local church|Christian churches]] who prayed for the patients "were allowed to pray in their own manner, but they were instructed to include the following phrase in their prayers: "for a successful surgery with a quick, healthy recovery and no complications".&lt;ref name="Shermer"/&gt;  Some participants complained that this mechanical way they were told to pray as part of the experiment was unusual for them. [[Complication (medicine)|Complications]] of surgery occurred in 52 percent of those who received prayer (Group 1), 51 percent of those who did not receive it (Group 2), and 59 percent of patients who knew they would receive prayers (Group 3). There were no statistically significant differences in major complications or thirty-day mortality. In ''[[The God Delusion]],'' [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote, "It seems more probable that those patients who knew they were being prayed for suffered additional stress in consequence: [[performance anxiety]]', as the experimenters put it. Dr Charles Bethea, one of the researchers, said, "It may have made them uncertain, wondering am I so sick they had to call in their prayer team?'"&lt;ref name=DelusionQuote&gt;{{cite book | chapter=The Great Prayer Experiment | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=god%20delusion&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | author=Richard Dawkins | title=[[The God Delusion]] | year=2006 | pages=87–88 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study co-author Jeffery Dusek stated that: "Each study builds on others, and STEP advanced the design beyond what had been previously done.  The findings, however, could well be due to the study limitations."&lt;ref name="HarvardNewsRel"/&gt;  Team leader Benson stated that STEP was not the last word on the effects of intercessory prayer and that questions raised by the study will require additional answers.&lt;ref name="HarvardGazette"/&gt;

==Literature reviews==
A [[meta-analysis]] of several studies related to distant intercessory healing was published in the ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' in 2000.&lt;ref name=astin &gt;John A. Astin, et al. ''The Efficacy of "Distant Healing" A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials'' [[Annals of Internal Medicine]] June 6, 2000 vol. 132 no. 11 903-910 [http://www.annals.org/content/132/11/903.abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors analyzed 23 trials of 2,774 patients. Five of the trials were for prayer as the distant healing method, 11 were with noncontact touch, and 7 were other forms. Of these trials, 13 showed statistically significant beneficial treatment results, 9 showed no effect, and 1 showed a negative result. The authors concluded that it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding distant healing and suggested further studies.&lt;ref name=astin /&gt;

A 2003 [[levels of evidence]] review found "some" evidence for the hypothesis that "Being prayed for improves physical recovery from acute illness".&lt;ref name="PowellShahabiThoresen"/&gt;  It concluded that although "a number of studies" have tested this hypothesis, "only three have sufficient rigor for review here" (Byrd 1988, Harris et al. 1999, and Sicher et al. 1998). In all three, "the strongest findings were for the variables that were evaluated most subjectively. This raises concerns about the possible inadvertent unmasking of the outcomes assessors. Moreover, the absence of a clearly plausible biological mechanism by which such a treatment could influence hard medical outcome results in the inclination to be skeptical of results." This 2003 review was performed before the 2005 MANTRA study and the 2006 STEP project, neither of which were conclusive in establishing the efficacy of prayer.

Various broader meta-studies of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that "There is no scientifically discernable effect for intercessory prayer as assessed in controlled studies".&lt;ref name=Masters &gt;K. Masters, G. Spielmans, J. Goodson "Are there demonstrable effects of distant intercessory prayer? A meta-analytic review." ''[[Annals of Behavioral Medicine]]'' 2006 Aug;32(1):21-6. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16827626]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2007 systemic review of 17 intercessory prayer studies found "small, but significant, effect sizes for the use of intercessory prayer" in 7 studies, but "prayer was unassociated with positive improvement in the condition of client" in the other 10, concluding that based upon the [[American Psychology Association]]'s Division 12 ([[clinical psychology]]) criteria for evidence-based practice, intercessory prayer "must be classified as an experimental intervention." The review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies had failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref name=DRHodge&gt;David R. Hodge, "A Systematic Review of the Empirical Literature on Intercessory Prayer" in ''Research on Social Work Practice'' March 2007 vol. 17 no. 2 174-187 {{doi|10.1177/1049731506296170}} [http://rsw.sagepub.com/content/17/2/174.abstract Article abstract] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202025826/http://rsw.sagepub.com/content/17/2/174.abstract |date=2011-12-02 }} [http://www.sagepub.com/vaughnstudy/articles/intervention/Hodge.pdf Full length article]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{merge|Telehealth|discuss=Talk:Telehealth#Merger_proposal|date=October 2017}}
'''Telemedicine''' is the use of [[telecommunication]] and [[information technology]] to provide [[health care|clinical health care]] from a distance. It has been used to overcome distance barriers and to improve access to medical services that would often not be consistently available in distant rural communities. It is also used to save lives in [[Trauma (medicine)|critical care]] and [[Emergency medicine|emergency situations]].

Although there were distant precursors to telemedicine, it is essentially a product of 20th century telecommunication and information technologies. These technologies permit communications between patient and medical staff with both convenience and fidelity, as well as the [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of medical, [[medical imaging|imaging]] and [[health informatics]] data from one site to another.

Early forms of telemedicine achieved with telephone and radio have been supplemented with [[videotelephony]], advanced [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostic methods]] supported by [[Client–server model|distributed client/server applications]], and additionally with telemedical devices to support in-home care.&lt;ref name="Sachpazidis"&gt;{{cite thesis | url=https://www.consultingradiologists.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dissertation-final-10Nov2008.pdf| title = Image and Medical Data Communication Protocols for Telemedicine and Teleradiology (dissertation)|publisher = Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Darmstadt | location = Darmstadt, Germany| date=10 Jul 2008|last = Sachpazidis | first = Ilias |access-date=14 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disambiguation ==
The definition of ''telemedicine'' is somewhat controversial. Some definitions (such as the definition given by the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/goe/publications/goe_telemedicine_2010.pdf|date=13 January 2011|title=2010 Opportunities and developments &amp;#124; Report on the second global survey on eHealth &amp;#124; Global Observatory for eHealth series - Volume 2: TELEMEDICINE|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) include all aspects of healthcare including preventive care. The American Telemedicine Association uses the terms telemedicine and [[telehealth]] interchangeably, although it acknowledges that telehealth is sometimes used more broadly for remote health not involving active clinical treatments.&lt;ref name="ATA" /&gt;

[[eHealth]] is another related term, used particularly in the U.K. and Europe, as an umbrella term that includes telehealth, [[electronic medical record]]s, and other components of [[health information technology]].

==Benefits and drawbacks==

Telemedicine can be beneficial to patients in isolated communities and remote regions, who can receive care from doctors or specialists far away without the patient having to travel to visit them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Berman | first = Matthew | last2 = Fenaughty | first2 = Andrea | title = Technology and managed care: patient benefits of telemedicine in a rural health care network | journal = Health Economics | volume = 14 | issue = 6| pages = 559–573 | date = June 2005 | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1002/hec.952| pmid = 15497196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments in [[mobile collaboration]] technology can allow healthcare professionals in multiple locations to share information and discuss patient issues as if they were in the same place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Van't Haaff | first = Corey | title = Virtually On-sight | page = 22 | publisher = Just for Canadian Doctors | date = March–April 2009 | url = http://www.justforcanadiandoctors.com/pastissues/JFCD2009/JFCD-Mar-Apr2009.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120324052954/http://www.justforcanadiandoctors.com/pastissues/JFCD2009/JFCD-Mar-Apr2009.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Remote patient monitoring through [[mobile technology]] can reduce the need for outpatient visits and enable remote prescription verification and drug administration oversight, potentially significantly reducing the overall cost of medical care.&lt;ref name="MobilePatient"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything | last = Saylor | first = Michael | year = 2012 | publisher = Perseus Books/Vanguard Press | page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telemedicine can also facilitate medical education by allowing workers to observe experts in their fields and share best practices more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Conde | first = Jose G. | last2 = De | first2 = Suvranu | last3 = Hall | first3 = Richard W. | last4 = Johansen | first4 = Edward | last5 = Meglan | first5 = Dwight | last6 = Peng | first6 = Grace C. Y. | title = Telehealth Innovations in Health Education and Training | journal = Telemedicine and e-Health | volume = 16 | number = 1 | pages = 103–106 | date = January–February 2010 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2009.0152| pmid = 20155874 | pmc=2937346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telemedicine also can eliminate the possible transmission of [[infectious disease]]s or [[parasite]]s between patients and medical staff. This is particularly an issue where [[MRSA]] is a concern. Additionally, some patients who feel uncomfortable in a doctors office may do better remotely. For example, [[white coat syndrome]] may be avoided. Patients who are home-bound and would otherwise require an ambulance to move them to a clinic are also a consideration.

The downsides of telemedicine include the cost of telecommunication and data management equipment and of technical training for medical personnel who will employ it. Virtual medical treatment also entails potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional, and an increased risk that [[protected health information]] may be compromised through electronic storage and transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hjelm | first = N. M. | title = Benefits and drawbacks of telemedicine | journal = Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare | date = 1 March 2005 | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 60–70 | url = http://jtt.sagepub.com/content/11/2/60.full.pdf+html | doi = 10.1258/1357633053499886| pmid = 15829049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a concern that telemedicine may actually decrease time efficiency due to the difficulties of assessing and treating patients through virtual interactions; for example, it has been estimated that a [[teledermatology]] consultation can take up to thirty minutes, whereas fifteen minutes is typical for a traditional consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rrh.org.au/publishedarticles/article_print_1581.pdf | title = Barriers to the up-take of telemedicine in Australia – a view from providers | work = The University of Queensland, School of Medicine | author = JJ Moffatt | date = February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, potentially poor quality of transmitted records, such as images or patient progress reports, and decreased access to relevant clinical information are quality assurance risks that can compromise the quality and continuity of patient care for the reporting doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmc = 2082971 | title = One hundred years of telemedicine: does this new technology have a place in paediatrics? | date = December 2006 | pmid=17119071 | doi=10.1136/adc.2006.099622 | volume=91 | issue=12 |vauthors=Strehle EM, Shabde N | journal=Arch. Dis. Child. | pages=956–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other obstacles to the implementation of telemedicine include unclear legal regulation for some telemedical practices and difficulty claiming reimbursement from insurers or government programs in some fields.&lt;ref name="Angaran"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Angaran | first = DM | title = Telemedicine and Telepharmacy: Current Status and Future Implications | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 15 Jul 1999 | volume = 56 | pages = 1405–1426 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/56/14/1405.abstract | issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another disadvantage of telemedicine is the inability to start treatment immediately. For example, a patient suffering from a bacterial infection might be given an [[antibiotic]] [[hypodermic injection]] in the clinic, and observed for any reaction, before that antibiotic is prescribed in pill form.

== History ==

In the early 1900s, people living in remote areas of [[Australia]] used two-way radios, powered by a [[Electrical generator|dynamo]] driven by a set of bicycle pedals, to communicate with the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1925 the inventor [[Hugo Gernsback]] wrote an article for the magazine [[Science and Invention]] which included a prediction of a future where patients could be treated remotely by doctors through a device he called a "teledactyl". His descriptions of the device are similar to what would later become possible with new technology.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/telemedicine-predicted-in-1925-124140942/]'' Telemedicine Predicted in 1925&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1967 one of the first telemedicine clinics was founded by Kenneth Bird at Massachusetts General Hospital. The clinic addressed the fundamental problem of delivering occupational and emergency health services to employees and travellers at Boston's [[Logan International Airport]], located three congested miles from the hospital. Over 1,000 patients are documented as having received remote treatment from doctors at MGH using the clinic's two-way audiovisual microwave circuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/457684 "Highlights from the Eighth Annual Meeting of the American Telemedicine Association"] (Accessed December 10, 2008),Medscape website&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of Bird's clinic more or less coincided with [[NASA]]'s foray into telemedicine through the use of physiologic monitors for astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tie.telemed.org/articles/article.asp?path=articles&amp;article=tmhistory_nb_tie95.xml "A Brief History of Telemedicine" ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124075453/http://tie.telemed.org/articles/article.asp?path=articles&amp;article=tmhistory_nb_tie95.xml |date=2007-11-24 }}, Telemedicine Information Exchange website, (Accessed December 10, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  
Other pioneering programs in telemedicine were designed to deliver healthcare services to people in rural settings.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
The first interactive telemedicine system, operating over standard telephone lines, designed to [[Remote diagnostics|remotely diagnose]] and treat patients requiring cardiac resuscitation ([[defibrillation]]) was developed and launched by an American company, MedPhone Corporation, in 1989. A year later under the leadership of its President/CEO S Eric Wachtel, MedPhone introduced a mobile cellular version, the MDPhone. Twelve hospitals in the U.S. served as receiving and treatment centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blyth | first = W. John | title = Telecommunications, Concepts, Development, and Management | edition = Second | publisher = Glencoe/McCgraw-Hill | year = 1990 | pages = 280–282 |isbn=0026808412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Categories ===

Telemedicine can be broken into three main categories: [[store-and-forward]], [[remote patient monitoring]] and [[interactive|(real-time) interactive]] services.

==== Store and forward ====
Store-and-forward telemedicine involves acquiring medical data (like [[medical imaging|medical images]], [[biosignal]]s etc.) and then transmitting this data to a doctor or medical specialist at a convenient time for assessment [[offline]].&lt;ref name="ATA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.americantelemed.org/learn/what-is-telemedicine | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130508215350/http://www.americantelemed.org/learn/what-is-telemedicine | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 8 May 2013 | title = What is Telemedicine? | publisher = American Telemedicine Association | location = Washington, D.C. | accessdate = 21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not require the presence of both parties at the same time.&lt;ref name="Sachpazidis" /&gt; [[Dermatology]] (cf: [[teledermatology]]), [[radiology]], and [[pathology]] are common specialties that are conducive to asynchronous telemedicine. A properly structured [[medical record]] preferably in [[Electronic medical record|electronic]] form should be a component of this transfer. A key difference between traditional in-person patient meetings and telemedicine encounters is the omission of an actual physical examination and history. The 'store-and-forward' process requires the clinician to rely on a history report and audio/video information in lieu of a physical examination.

==== Remote monitoring ====
[[File:Telehealth - Blood Pressure Monitor.jpg|thumb|Telehealth Blood Pressure Monitor]]
Remote monitoring, also known as self-monitoring or testing, enables medical professionals to monitor a patient remotely using various technological devices. This method is primarily used for managing chronic diseases or specific conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or asthma. These services can provide comparable health outcomes to traditional in-person patient encounters, supply greater satisfaction to patients, and may be cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salehahmadi|first=Zeinab|last2=Hajialiasghari|first2=Fatemeh|date=2017-03-02|year=|title=Telemedicine in Iran: Chances and Challenges|journal=World Journal of Plastic Surgery|volume=2|issue=1|pages=18–25|issn=2228-7914|pmc=4238336|pmid=25489500|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include home-based nocturnal [[dialysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Pierratos, MD.

A recent study identified three major barriers to adoption of telemedicine in emergency and critical care units. They include:
*'''regulatory''' challenges related to the difficulty and cost of obtaining licensure across multiple states, malpractice protection and privileges at multiple facilities
*Lack of acceptance and reimbursement by government payers and some commercial insurance carriers creating a major '''financial''' barrier, which places the investment burden squarely upon the hospital or healthcare system.
*'''Cultural''' barriers occurring from the lack of desire, or unwillingness, of some physicians to adapt clinical paradigms for telemedicine applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rogove | first = Herbert J. | last2 = McArthur | first2 = David | last3 = Demaerschalk | first3 = Bart M. | last4 = Vespa | first4 = Paul M. | title = Barriers to Telemedicine: Survey of Current Users in Acute Care Units | journal = Telemedicine and e-Health | date = January–February 2012 | volume = 18 | number = 1 | pages = 48–53 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2011.0071| pmid = 22082107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telenursing ===
{{main|Telenursing}}

'''Telenursing''' refers to the use of [[telecommunications]] and [[information technology]] in order to provide [[nursing]] services in health care whenever a large physical distance exists between patient and nurse, or between any number of nurses. As a field it is part of telehealth, and has many points of contacts with other medical and non-medical applications, such as [[telediagnosis]], teleconsultation, telemonitoring, etc.

Telenursing is achieving significant growth rates in many countries due to several factors: the preoccupation in reducing the costs of health care, an increase in the number of [[aging]] and chronically ill population, and the increase in coverage of health care to distant, rural, small or sparsely populated regions. Among its benefits, telenursing may help solve increasing shortages of nurses; to reduce distances and save travel time, and to keep patients out of hospital. A greater degree of job satisfaction has been registered among telenurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.e-health-insider.com/news/item.cfm?ID=1263 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060618103208/http://www.e-health-insider.com/news/item.cfm?ID=1263 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 18 June 2006 | title = Nurses Happier Using Telecare, Says International Survey | publisher = eHealth Insider | date = 15 June 2005 | accessdate = 4 April 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telepharmacy ===

[[File:Winn Army Community Hospital Pharmacy Stays Online During Power Outage.jpg|thumb|alt=Pharmacists filling prescriptions at a computer | Pharmacy personnel deliver [[medical prescription]]s electronically; remote delivery of [[pharmaceutical care]] is an example of '''telemedicine'''.]]

{{main|Telepharmacy}}

Telepharmacy is the delivery of [[pharmaceutical care]] via [[telecommunications]] to patients in locations where they may not have direct contact with a [[pharmacist]]. It is an instance of the wider phenomenon of telemedicine, as implemented in the field of [[pharmacy]]. Telepharmacy services include [[drug therapy]] monitoring, patient counseling, prior authorization and refill authorization for [[prescription drugs]], and monitoring of [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] compliance with the aid of [[teleconferencing]] or [[videoconferencing]]. [[Remote dispensing]] of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy. Telepharmacy services can be delivered at retail pharmacy sites or through hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical care facilities.

The term can also refer to the use of videoconferencing in pharmacy for other purposes, such as providing education, training, and management services to pharmacists and pharmacy staff remotely.&lt;ref name="Angaran" /&gt;

=== Teleneuropsychology ===
Teleneuropsychology (Cullum et al., 2014) is the use of telehealth/videoconference technology for the remote administration of neuropsychological tests. Neuropsychological tests are used to evaluate the cognitive status of individuals with known or suspected brain disorders and provide a profile of cognitive strengths and weaknesses.  Through a series of studies, there is growing support in the literature showing that remote videoconference-based administration of many standard neuropsychological tests results in test findings that are similar to traditional in-person evaluations, thereby establishing the basis for the reliability and validity of teleneuropsychological assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/arclin/acx140 |title=Validity of Teleneuropsychological Assessment in Older Patients with Cognitive Disorders |journal=Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology |year=2018 |last1=Wadsworth |first1=Hannah E |last2=Dhima |first2=Kaltra |last3=Womack |first3=Kyle B |last4=Hart |first4=John |last5=Weiner |first5=Myron F |last6=Hynan |first6=Linda S |last7=Cullum |first7=C Munro }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/arclin/acw030 |pmid=27246957 |title=Remote Neuropsychological Assessment in Rural American Indians with and without Cognitive Impairment |journal=Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=420 |year=2016 |last1=Wadsworth |first1=Hannah E |last2=Galusha-Glasscock |first2=Jeanine M |last3=Womack |first3=Kyle B |last4=Quiceno |first4=Mary |last5=Weiner |first5=Myron F |last6=Hynan |first6=Linda S |last7=Shore |first7=Jay |last8=Cullum |first8=C.

=== Telerehabilitation ===

{{main|Telerehabilitation}}

'''Telerehabilitation''' (or ''e-rehabilitation''&lt;ref name="dl-2005"&gt;{{cite book | year = 2005 | title = E-health care information systems: an introduction for students and professionals | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | isbn = 978-0-7879-6618-8 | page = 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://ijahsp.nova.edu/articles/vol2num4/pierce-keaton.htm | title = An E-rehabilitation Team Helps Caregivers Deal with Stroke | publisher = Ijahsp.nova.edu | accessdate = 26 March 2011 | journal = The Internet Journal of Allied Health Sciences and Practice | volume = 2.4 | issn = 1540-580X | author1 = Lisa Keaton | author2 = Linda L. Pierce | author3 = Victoria Steiner | author4 = Karen Lance}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the delivery of [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] services over [[telecommunication network]]s and the Internet. Most types of services fall into two categories: clinical assessment (the patient's functional abilities in his or her environment), and [[medical therapy|clinical therapy]]. Some fields of rehabilitation practice that have explored telerehabilitation are: [[neuropsychology]], [[speech-language pathology]], [[audiology]], [[occupational therapy]], and [[physical therapy]]. Telerehabilitation can deliver therapy to people who cannot travel to a [[clinic]] because the patient has a [[disability]] or because of travel time. Telerehabilitation also allows experts in rehabilitation to engage in a clinical consultation at a distance.

Most telerehabilitation is highly visual. As of 2014, the most commonly used mediums are [[webcam]]s, [[videoconferencing]], [[phone line]]s, [[videophone]]s and webpages containing rich Internet applications. The visual nature of telerehabilitation technology limits the types of rehabilitation services that can be provided. It is most widely used for [[neuropsychological rehabilitation]]; fitting of rehabilitation equipment such as [[wheelchair]]s, [[Brace (orthopaedic)|braces]] or [[artificial limb]]s; and in speech-language pathology. [[Rich internet applications]] for neuropsychological rehabilitation (aka [[cognitive rehabilitation]]) of cognitive impairment (from many etiologies) were first introduced in 2001. This endeavor has expanded as a [[teletherapy]] application for cognitive skills enhancement programs for school children. [[Tele-audiology]] (hearing assessments) is a growing application. Currently, telerehabilitation in the practice of occupational therapy and physical therapy is limited, perhaps because these two disciplines are more "hands on".

Two important areas of telerehabilitation research are (1) demonstrating equivalence of assessment and therapy to in-person assessment and therapy, and (2) building new data collection systems to digitize information that a therapist can use in practice. Ground-breaking research in [[telehaptics]] (the sense of touch) and virtual reality may broaden the scope of telerehabilitation practice, in the future.

In the United States, the [[National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research]]'s (NIDRR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031011114426/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html?src=mr|title=OSERS|website=www.ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; supports research and the development of telerehabilitation. NIDRR's grantees include the "Rehabilitation Engineering and Research Center" (RERC) at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]], the State University of New York at Buffalo, and the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington DC. Other federal funders of research are the [[Veterans Health Administration]], the Health Services Research Administration in the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Hiers| first = Mary| title = Everything You Need to Know About Telemedicine| url = http://www.accessrx.com/blog/current-health-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-telemedicine-m0525/| accessdate = 10 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the United States, excellent research is conducted in Australia and Europe.

Only a few health insurers in the United States, and about half of Medicaid programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2003.09.008 |pmid=15241772 |title=Medicaid payment for telerehabilitation |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=85 |issue=7 |pages=1188–91 |year=2004 |last1=Palsbo |first1=Susan E }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[reimburse]] for telerehabilitation services. If the research shows that teleassessments and teletherapy are equivalent to clinical encounters, it is more likely that [[insurer]]s and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] will cover telerehabilitation services.

=== Teletrauma care ===

Telemedicine can be utilized to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of care in a trauma environment. Examples include:

Telemedicine for trauma triage: using telemedicine, trauma specialists can interact with personnel on the scene of a mass casualty or disaster situation, via the internet using mobile devices, to determine the severity of injuries. They can provide clinical assessments and determine whether those injured must be evacuated for necessary care. Remote trauma specialists can provide the same quality of clinical assessment and plan of care as a trauma specialist located physically with the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Collins | first = Hilton | title = Advanced First Responder and Medical Capabilities Could Save Lives | journal = Emergency Management | date = 28 August 2008 | url = http://www.emergencymgmt.com/disaster/Advanced-First-Responder-and.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telemedicine for [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) rounds: Telemedicine is also being used in some trauma ICUs to reduce the spread of infections. Rounds are usually conducted at hospitals across the country by a team of approximately ten or more people to include attending physicians, fellows, residents and other clinicians. This group usually moves from bed to bed in a unit discussing each patient. This aids in the transition of care for patients from the night shift to the morning shift, but also serves as an educational experience for new residents to the team. A new approach features the team conducting rounds from a conference room using a video-conferencing system. The trauma attending, residents, fellows, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists are able to watch a live video stream from the patient's bedside. They can see the vital signs on the monitor, view the settings on the respiratory ventilator, and/or view the patient's wounds. Video-conferencing allows the remote viewers two-way communication with clinicians at the bedside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Advanced technologies and wireless telecommunications enhance care and medical training at the Ryder Trauma Center in Miami | publisher = Virtual Medical Worlds | date = 4 December 2008 | url = http://www.hoise.com/vmw/09/articles/vmw/LV-VM-01-09-10.html | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telemedicine for trauma education: some trauma centers are delivering trauma education lectures to hospitals and health care providers worldwide using video conferencing technology. Each lecture provides fundamental principles, firsthand knowledge and evidenced-based methods for critical analysis of established clinical practice standards, and comparisons to newer advanced alternatives. The various sites collaborate and share their perspective based on location, available staff, and available resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = EMS Trauma Grand Rounds| publisher = Utah Telehealth Network| accessdate = 23 July 2013| url = http://www.utahtelehealth.net/education/ems_trauma.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090916083826/http://www.utahtelehealth.net/education/ems_trauma.html| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 16 September 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telemedicine in the trauma operating room: trauma surgeons are able to observe and consult on cases from a remote location using video conferencing. This capability allows the attending to view the residents in real time. The remote surgeon has the capability to control the camera (pan, tilt and zoom) to get the best angle of the procedure while at the same time providing expertise in order to provide the best possible care to the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gonzalez | first = Diana | title = UM Doctors Use Telemedicine to Continue Care In Iraq | publisher =  | date = 10 November 2011 | url = http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/UM-Doctors-Use-Tele-133650778.html | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specialist care delivery ==

Telemedicine can facilitate specialty care delivered by [[primary care physician]]s according to a controlled study of the treatment of [[hepatitis C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1009370 |pmid=21631316 |pmc=3820419 |title=Outcomes of Treatment for Hepatitis C Virus Infection by Primary Care Providers |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=364 |issue=23 |pages=2199–207 |year=2011 |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Thornton |first2=Karla |last3=Murata |first3=Glen |last4=Deming |first4=Paulina |last5=Kalishman |first5=Summers |last6=Dion |first6=Denise |last7=Parish |first7=Brooke |last8=Burke |first8=Thomas |last9=Pak |first9=Wesley |last10=Dunkelberg |first10=Jeffrey |last11=Kistin |first11=Martin |last12=Brown |first12=John |last13=Jenkusky |first13=Steven |last14=Komaromy |first14=Miriam |last15=Qualls |first15=Clifford }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various specialties are contributing to telemedicine, in varying degrees.

=== Telecardiology ===

ECGs, or [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiographs]], can be transmitted using telephone and wireless. [[Willem Einthoven]], the inventor of the ECG, actually did tests with transmission of ECG via telephone lines. This was because the hospital did not allow him to move patients outside the hospital to his laboratory for testing of his new device. In 1906 Einthoven came up with a way to transmit the data from the hospital directly to his lab.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medetel.lu/download/2009/parallel_sessions/presentation/day1/telecardiology_and_tele-ecg_network.pdf Telecardiology].&lt;/ref&gt;
See above reference-General health care delivery. Remotely treating ventricular fibrillation Medphone Corporation, 1989

==== Teletransmission of ECG using methods indigenous to Asia ====

One of the oldest known telecardiology systems for teletransmissions of ECGs was established in Gwalior, India in 1975 at GR Medical college by Ajai Shanker, S. Makhija, P.K. Mantri using an indigenous technique for the first time in India.

This system enabled wireless transmission of ECG from the moving ICU van or the patients home to the central station in ICU of the department of Medicine. Transmission using wireless was done using frequency modulation which eliminated noise. Transmission was also done through telephone lines. The ECG output was connected to the telephone input using a modulator which converted ECG into high frequency sound. At the other end a demodulator reconverted the sound into ECG with a good gain accuracy. The ECG was converted to sound waves with a frequency varying from 500&amp;nbsp;Hz to 2500&amp;nbsp;Hz with 1500&amp;nbsp;Hz at baseline.

This system was also used to monitor patients with pacemakers in remote areas. The central control unit at the ICU was able to correctly interpret arrhythmia. This technique helped medical aid reach in remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= = Teletransmission of ECG Waveform: An Ingenious Low Priced Technique | journal = Indian Heart Journal | year = 1982 | volume = 34 | number = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[Stethoscope#Electronic|electronic stethoscopes]] can be used as recording devices, which is helpful for purposes of telecardiology. There are many examples of successful telecardiology services worldwide.

In [[Pakistan]] three pilot projects in telemedicine was initiated by the Ministry of IT &amp; Telecom, Government of Pakistan (MoIT) through the Electronic Government Directorate in collaboration with Oratier Technologies (a pioneer company within Pakistan dealing with healthcare and HMIS) and PakDataCom (a bandwidth provider). Three hub stations through were linked via the Pak Sat-I communications satellite, and four districts were linked with another hub. A 312 Kb link was also established with remote sites and 1 Mbit/s bandwidth was provided at each hub. Three hubs were established: the Mayo Hospital (the largest hospital in Asia), JPMC Karachi and Holy Family Rawalpindi. These 12 remote sites were connected and on average of 1,500 patients being treated per month per hub. The project was still running smoothly after two years.&lt;ref name="83a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://202.83.164.29/egdsite04/?p=projimpu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704102514/http://202.83.164.29/egdsite04/?p=projimpu  |archive-date=2011-07-04 |dead-url=yes |title=Electronic Government Directorate &amp;#124; Pakistan telemedicine |accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telepsychiatry ===
{{main|Telepsychiatry}}

Telepsychiatry, another aspect of telemedicine, also utilizes [[videoconferencing]] for patients residing in underserved areas to access psychiatric services. It offers wide range of services to the patients and providers, such as consultation between the psychiatrists, educational clinical programs, diagnosis and assessment, medication therapy management, and routine follow-up meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hoffman | first = Jan | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/fashion/therapists-are-seeing-patients-online.html?_r=1 | title = When Your Therapist Is Only a Click Away | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = 25 September 2011 | page = ST1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most telepsychiatry is undertaken in real time (synchronous) although in recent years research at UC Davis has developed and validated the process of asynchronous telepsychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8_5hCF2q6I|accessdate = 2015-11-14|title= Telepsychiatry Research by Peter Yellowlees}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent reviews of the literature by Hilty et al. in 2013, and by Yellowlees et al. in 2015 confirmed that telepsychiatry is as effective as in-person psychiatric consultations for diagnostic assessment, is at least as good for the treatment of disorders such as depression and post traumatic stress disorder, and may be better than in-person treatment in some groups of patients, notably children, veterans and individuals with agoraphobia.

As of 2011, the following are some of the model programs and projects which are deploying telepsychiatry in rural areas in the United States:

# Military Psychiatry, [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]].
# In 2009, the South Carolina Department of Mental Health established a partnership with the [[University of South Carolina School of Medicine]] and the South Carolina Hospital Association to form a statewide telepsychiatry program that provides access to psychiatrists 16 hours a day, 7 days a week, to treat patients with mental health issues who present at rural emergency departments in the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality| url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/statewide-partnership-provides-mental-health-assessments-telemedicine-patients-rural |title=Statewide Partnership Provides Mental Health Assessments via Telemedicine to Patients in Rural Emergency Departments, Reducing Wait Times, Hospitalizations, and Costs |date=2013-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a growing number of HIPAA compliant technologies for performing telepsychiatry. There is an independent comparison site of current technologies.

Links for several sites related to telemedicine, telepsychiatry policy, guidelines, and networking are available at the website for the [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.psychiatry.org/practice/professional-interests/underserved-communities/telepsychiatry | title = Telepsychiatry | publisher = American Psychiatric Association | accessdate = 24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telementalhealthcomparisons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telementalhealthcomparisons.com|title=Telemental Health Technologies Compared|publisher=telementalhealthcomparisons.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been a recent trend towards Video CBT sites with the recent endorsement and support of CBT by the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cognitive-behavioural-therapy/Pages/Introduction.aspx | publisher = NHS Choices | title = Cognitive behavioural therapy | accessdate = 24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, a Manchester-based Video CBT pilot project was launched to provide live video therapy sessions for those with depression, anxiety, and stress related conditions called InstantCBT&lt;ref name="instantcbt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instantcbt.com/ |title=Instant Change Center |publisher=instantcbt.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site supported at launch a variety of video platforms (including Skype, GChat, Yahoo, MSN as well as bespoke)&lt;ref name="instantcbt2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instantcbt.com/requirements/ |title=Instant Change Center &amp;#124; InstantCBT Requirements Page |publisher=instantcbt.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was aimed at lowering the waiting times for mental health patients. This is a Commercial, For-Profit business.

In the United States, the American Telemedicine Association and the Center of Telehealth and eHealth are the most respectable places to go for information about telemedicine.

The [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA), is a United States Federal Law that applies to all modes of electronic information exchange such as video-conferencing mental health services. In the United States, Skype, Gchat, Yahoo, and MSN are not permitted to conduct video-conferencing services unless these companies sign a Business Associate Agreement stating that their employees are HIPAA trained. For this reason, most companies provide their own specialized videotelephony services. Violating HIPAA in the United States can result in penalties of hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hipaajournal.com/what-are-the-penalties-for-hipaa-violations-7096/|title=What are the Penalties for HIPAA Violations?|date=2015-06-24|work=HIPAA Journal|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The momentum of telemental health and telepsychiatry is growing. In June 2012 the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|U.S. Veterans Administration]] announced expansion of the successful telemental health pilot. Their target was for 200,000 cases in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2335|title=News Releases - Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs|first=Office of Public and Intergovernmental|last=Affairs|website=www.va.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing number of HIPAA compliant technologies are now available.

=== Teleradiology ===

{{main|Teleradiology}}
[[File:CT viewer Chest Keosys.JPG|right|thumb|A CT exam displayed through teleradiology]]

Teleradiology is the ability to send [[Radiography|radiographic]] images ([[x-ray]]s, CT, MR, PET/CT, SPECT/CT, MG, US...) from one location to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3892/or.15.4.1091 |title=Integrated telemedicine applications and services for oncological positron emission tomography |journal=Oncology Reports |year=2006 |last1=Kontaxakis |first1=George |last2=Visvikis |first2=Dimitris |last3=Ohl |first3=Roland |last4=Sachpazidis |first4=Ilias |last5=Suarez |first5=Juan |last6=Selby |first6=Peter |last7=Cheze-Le Rest |first7=Catherine |last8=Santos |first8=Andres |last9=Ortega |first9=Fernando |last10=Diaz |first10=Javier |last11=Pan |first11=Leyun |last12=Strauss |first12=Ludwig |last13=Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss |first13=Antonia |last14=Sakas |first14=Georgios |last15=Pozo |first15=Miguel }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this process to be implemented, three essential components are required, an image sending station, a transmission network, and a receiving-image review station. The most typical implementation are two computers connected via the Internet. The computer at the receiving end will need to have a high-quality display screen that has been tested and cleared for clinical purposes. Sometimes the receiving computer will have a printer so that images can be printed for convenience.

The teleradiology process begins at the image sending station. The radiographic image and a modem or other connection are required for this first step. The image is scanned and then sent via the network connection to the receiving computer.

Today's high-speed broadband based Internet enables the use of new technologies for teleradiology: the image reviewer can now have access to distant servers in order to view an exam. Therefore, they do not need particular workstations to view the images; a standard [[personal computer]] (PC) and [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) connection is enough to reach keosys central server. No particular software is necessary on the PC and the images can be reached from wherever in the world.

Teleradiology is the most popular use for telemedicine and accounts for at least 50% of all telemedicine usage.

=== Telepathology ===

{{main|Telepathology}}

Telepathology is the practice of [[pathology]] at a distance. It uses [[telecommunications|telecommunications technology]] to facilitate the transfer of image-rich pathology data between distant locations for the purposes of [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], [[Medical education|education]], and [[Medical research|research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weinstein | first = RS | last2 = Graham | first2 = AM | last3 = Richter | first3 = LC | last4 = Barker  | first4 = GP | last5 = Krupinski  | first5 = EA | last6 = Lopez  | first6 = AM | last7 = Yagi  | first7 = Y | last8 = Gilbertson  | first8 = JR | last9 = Bhattacharyya | first9 = AK | last10 = Gilbertson | first10 = J.

The use of  "[[microscopy|television microscopy]]", the forerunner of telepathology, did not require that a pathologist have physical or virtual "hands-on" involvement is the selection of microscopic fields-of-view for analysis and diagnosis.

A pathologist, Ronald S. Weinstein, M.D., coined the term "telepathology" in 1986. In an editorial in a medical journal, Weinstein outlined the actions that would be needed to create remote pathology diagnostic services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =  Weinstein  | first = RS | title = Prospect for telepathology (Editorial) | journal = Hum Pathol | year = 1986 | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 433–434|doi=10.1016/s0046-8177(86)80028-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He, and his collaborators, published the first scientific paper on robotic telepathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  last =  Weinstein  |  first = RS |  last2 = Bloom  |  first2 = KJ |  last3 = Rozek  |  first3 = LS |  title = Telepathology and the networking of pathology diagnostic services |  journal = Arch Pathol Lab Med |  volume = 111 |  issue = 7 |  year = 1987 |  pages = 646–652|  pmid = 3606341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein was also granted the first U.S. [[patents]] for [[robotics|robotic]] telepathology systems and telepathology diagnostic networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  last = Kayser  |  first = K |  last2 = Szymas  |  first2 = J |  last3 = Weinstein  |  first3 = RS |  title = Telepathology: Telecommunications, Electronic Education and Publication in Pathology |  year = 1999 |  pages = 1–186 |  publisher = Springer, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein is known to many as the "father of telepathology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ReUnion '10 award winners | publisher = Union College | url = http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=8942 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120805232102/http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=8942 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 5 August 2012 | accessdate = 25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Norway, Eide and Nordrum implemented the first sustainable clinical telepathology service in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0046-8177(91)90226-F |pmid=1864583 |title=Remote frozen section service: A telepathology project in northern Norway |journal=Human Pathology |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=514–8 |year=1991 |last1=Nordrum |first1=Ivar |last2=Engum |first2=Bjørn |last3=Rinde |first3=Eivind |last4=Finseth |first4=Asgeir |last5=Ericsson |first5=Hans |last6=Kearney |first6=Michael |last7=Stalsberg |first7=Helge |last8=Eide |first8=Tor J }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is still in operation, decades later. A number of clinical telepathology services have benefited many thousands of patients in North America, Europe, and Asia.

Telepathology has been successfully used for many applications including the rendering [[histopathology]] tissue diagnoses, at a distance, for education, and for research. Although [[digital pathology]] imaging, including [[virtual microscopy]], is the mode of choice for telepathology services in developed countries, [[Analog signal|analog]] telepathology imaging is still used for patient services in some developing countries.

Teledentistry is the use of [[information technology]] and [[telecommunications]] for dental care, consultation, education, and public awareness in the same manner as [[telehealth]] and telemedicine.

=== Teleaudiology ===
{{main|Tele-audiology}}

Tele-audiology is the utilization of [[telehealth]] to provide [[audiological]] services and may include the full scope of audiological practice.

=== Teleophthalmology ===
{{main|Teleophthalmology}}

Teleophthalmology is a branch of telemedicine that delivers eye care through digital medical equipment and telecommunications technology. Today, applications of teleophthalmology encompass access to eye specialists for patients in remote areas, ophthalmic disease screening, diagnosis and monitoring; as well as distant learning. Teleophthalmology may help reduce disparities by providing remote, low-cost screening tests such as diabetic retinopathy screening to low-income and uninsured patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/telemedicine-based-eye-examinations-enhance-access-reduce-costs-and-increase-satisfaction |title=Telemedicine-Based Eye Examinations Enhance Access, Reduce Costs, and Increase Satisfaction for Low-Income and Minority Patients with Diabetes |date=2013-07-17 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/remote-retinal-screening-facilitates-diagnosis-and-treatment-retinopathy-poor-andor |title=Remote Retinal Screening Facilitates Diagnosis and Treatment of Retinopathy for Poor and/or Uninsured Patients With Diabetes in Rural California |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mizoram, India, a hilly area with poor roads, between 2011 till 2015, Tele-ophthalmology has provided care to over 10000 patients. These patients were examined by ophthalmic assistants locally but surgery was done on appointment after viewing the patient images online by Eye Surgeons in the hospital 6–12 hours away. Instead of an average 5 trips for say, a cataract procedure, only one was required for surgery alone as even post op care like stitch removal and glasses was done locally. There were huge cost savings in travel etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phukan|first=Riki|last2=Mehta|first2=Manoj Rai|last3=Gogia|first3=Shashi|date=2014-11-02|title=Results and Problems in Executing Teleophthalmology|url=http://ijmi.org/index.php/ijmi/article/view/260|journal=Indian Journal of Medical Informatics|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=32–33|issn=0973-9254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Licensure ==

=== U.S. licensing and regulatory issues ===

Restrictive licensure laws in the United States require a practitioner to obtain a full license to deliver telemedicine care across state lines. Typically, states with restrictive licensure laws also have several exceptions (varying from state to state) that may release an out-of-state practitioner from the additional burden of obtaining such a license. A number of states require practitioners who seek compensation to frequently deliver interstate care to acquire a full license.

If a practitioner serves several states, obtaining this license in each state could be an expensive and time-consuming proposition. Even if the practitioner never practices medicine face-to-face with a patient in another state, he/she still must meet a variety of other individual state requirements, including paying substantial licensure fees, passing additional oral and written examinations, and traveling for interviews.

In 2008, the U.S. passed the Ryan Haight Act which required face-to-face or valid telemedicine consultations prior to receiving a prescription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/health/Ryan-Haight-Act-will.html|title=Ryan Haight Act will Require Tighter Restrictions on Internet Pharmacies|website=www.govtech.com|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:Category:Medical licensing boards in the United States|State medical licensing boards]] have sometimes opposed telemedicine; for example, in 2012 electronic consultations were illegal in Idaho, and an Idaho-licensed general practitioner was punished by the board for prescribing an antibiotic, triggering reviews of her licensure and board certifications across the country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/aug/22/telemedicine-sanction-in-idaho-clouds-doctors/|title=Telemedicine sanction in Idaho clouds doctor’s future|website=Spokesman.com|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in 2015 the state legislature legalized electronic consultations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015, Teladoc filed suit against the [[Texas Medical Board]] over a rule that required in-person consultations initially; the judge refused to dismiss the case, noting that antitrust laws apply to state medical boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20151214/NEWS/151219924|title=Teladoc case against Texas Medical Board will move forward, judge rules|website=Modern Healthcare|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advanced and experimental services ==

=== Telesurgery ===
{{main|Remote surgery}}Remote surgery (also known as telesurgery) is the ability for a doctor to perform [[surgery]] on a patient even though they are not physically in the same location. It is a form of [[telepresence]]. Remote surgery combines elements of [[robot]]ics, cutting edge [[telecommunication|communication technology]] such as high-speed data connections, [[telehaptics|haptics]] and elements of [[management information system]]s. While the field of [[robotic surgery]] is fairly well established, most of these robots are controlled by surgeons at the location of the surgery.

Remote surgery is essentially advanced [[telecommuting]] for surgeons, where the physical distance between the surgeon and the patient is immaterial. It promises to allow the expertise of specialized surgeons to be available to patients worldwide, without the need for patients to travel beyond their local hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intersurgtech.com/media.html IST's Media Collection], Interface Surgical Technologies website. Retrieved 21 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Remote surgery]] or telesurgery is performance of surgical procedures where the surgeon is not physically in the same location as the patient, using a robotic [[teleoperator]] system controlled by the surgeon. The remote operator may give tactile feedback to the user. Remote surgery combines elements of robotics and high-speed data connections. A critical limiting factor is the speed, [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and reliability of the communication system between the surgeon and the patient, though trans-Atlantic surgeries have been demonstrated.

== Enabling technologies ==
{{further|List of video telecommunication services and product brands}}

=== Videotelephony ===
{{main|Videotelephony}}

Videotelephony comprises the technologies for the reception and transmission of audio-video signals by users at different locations, for communication between people in real-time.&lt;ref name=McGrawHill&gt;McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Engineering. [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Videotelephony Videotelephony], McGraw-Hill, 2002. Retrieved from the FreeDictionary.com website, January 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

At the dawn of the technology, videotelephony also included ''image phones'' which would exchange still images between units every few seconds over conventional [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]]-type telephone lines, essentially the same as [[Slow-scan television|slow scan TV]] systems.

Currently videotelephony is particularly useful to the [[deaf]] and [[Speech disorder|speech-impaired]] who can use them with [[sign language]] and also with a [[Video Relay Service|video relay service]], and well as to those with [[disability|mobility issues]] or those who are located in distant places and are in need of [[telerehabilitation|telemedical]] or [[distance education|tele-educational]] services.

==Developing countries==
For developing countries, telemedicine and [[eHealth]] can be the only means of healthcare provision in remote areas. For example, the difficult financial situation in many African states and lack of trained health professionals has meant that the majority of the people in sub-Saharan Africa are badly disadvantaged in medical care, and in remote areas with low population density, direct healthcare provision is often very poor&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160205083116/http://euroafrica-ict.org.sigma-orionis.com/downloads/Coop_Forum/SessionC/Adesina_Iluyemi.pdf ''Refocusing Europe-Africa Strategy: Strategic Importance of eHealth''] NEPAD. Accessed 28 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, provision of telemedicine and eHealth from urban centres or from other countries is hampered by the lack of communications infrastructure, with no landline phone or broadband internet connection, little or no mobile connectivity, and often not even a reliable electricity supply.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Bethscheider [http://www.worldteleport.org/news/249029/Satellite-Is-Vital-For-A-Unified-Global-e-Health-System...-An-SES-Techcom-Services-Perspective-.htm ''Satellite is vital for a unified, global, E-Health system''] September 2015 World Teleport Association.

The god is dressed in the hooded cape typical of the depiction of Celts in [[Roman Gaul]].]]

In [[ancient Greek religion]], '''Telesphorus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Τελεσφόρος}} ''Telesphoros'') was a son of [[Asclepius]]. He frequently accompanied his sister, [[Hygieia]].  He was a [[Cabeiri|dwarf]] whose head was always covered with a [[cowl]] hood or [[Phrygian cap|cap]].  

He symbolized recovery from illness, as his name means "the accomplisher" or "bringer of completion" in Greek.    Representations of him  are found mainly in [[Anatolia]] and along the [[Danube]].

Telesphorus is assumed to have been a [[Celtic god]] in origin, who was taken to Anatolia by the [[Galatia]]ns in the 3rd century BC, where he would have become associated with the Greek god of medicine, Asclepius, perhaps in [[Pergamon]] (an Asclepian cult center) and spread again to the West due to the rise of the [[Roman Empire]], in particular during the 2nd century AD, from the reign of [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Lavagne, ''Les Dieux de la Gaule romaine'', Luxembourg, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6657">The '''Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005''' place a duty on employers within Great Britain to reduce the risk to their employees health by controlling the noise they are exposed to whilst at work.&lt;ref name="explanatory note"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1643/pdfs/uksiem_20051643_en.pdf Legislation.gov.uk | Control of Noise at Work regulations explanatory memorandum]&lt;/ref&gt;  The regulations were established under the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]] and implement European Council directive 2003/10/EC.  The regulations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg362.pdf HSE - Noise at work guidance (risk assessment section)]&lt;/ref&gt; replaced the 'Noise at work regulations 1989' which previously covered noise in the workplace.&lt;ref name="explanatory note" /&gt;  The regulations came into force for most industries on 6 April 2006 with the music and entertainment sectors coming into line two years later on 21 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1643/regulation/1/made Legislation.gov.uk | Noise - citation and commencement]&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Northern Ireland]] the legislation is dealt with in 'The Control of Noise at Work Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2006/1/note/made Legislation.gov.uk | The Control of Noise at Work Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyone in the engineering environment is exposed to noise and could suffer temporary or permanent hearing loss, the control of noise at work regulations require employers to eliminate or reduce noise levels.

==Differences with previous legislation==
The regulations replaced the Noise at Work regulations 1989 which had been introduced as a response to the 1986 European directive 86/188/EEC.&lt;ref name="H&amp;S tips" /&gt;  In 2001 the Swedish presidency of the EU put forward a proposal which would seek to replace the existing directive with a new one, 2003/10/EC.&lt;ref name="H&amp;S tips" /&gt;  This directive replaced the previous and in the UK became the Control of Noise at Work regulations 2005.&lt;ref name="H&amp;S tips"&gt;[http://www.healthandsafetytips.co.uk/Articles/Noise_at_Work.htm Health and Safety Tips | Noise at Work regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;  Differences between the pieces of legislation included a reduction in the threshold for hearing and protection and the introduction of noise control.  It introduced the daily exposure limit value as well as a permitted weekly value.  It also introduced requirements for health surveillance and hearing testing.&lt;ref name="H&amp;S tips" /&gt; 8-

==Exposure limits==
The regulations introduced a number of exposure limits in relation to noise in the workplace.  They defined the average level of noise that an employee could be exposed to during an average day or week as well as what the peak pressure would be within that period.  The exposure levels were set in decibels (dB) and given either an 'A' weighting, representing the average exposure or a 'C' rating, representing the peak exposure.&lt;ref name="guidance for employers, page 2"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg362.pdf Health and Safety Executive | Noise at Work Guidance for employers page 2]&lt;/ref&gt;  The lower exposure level of 80&amp;nbsp;dB(A) meant that should an employee's average exposure be over that amount then the employer would be required to assess the risk to workers health and provide employees with information and training.&lt;ref name="HSE noise regulations"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/noise/regulations.htm HSE | Noise at Work regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;  The upper exposure level of 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A) represented the limit at which employers needed to provide hearing protection and hearing zones.&lt;ref name="HSE noise regulations" /&gt;  The exposure limit value of 87&amp;nbsp;dB(A) represented the limit at which employees should not be exposed.&lt;ref name="HSE noise regulations" /&gt;

===Table of exposure limits===

|-

|}

==Risk Assessment==
The regulations are one of a number of Health and Safety pieces of legislation that require the 'suitable and sufficient' assessment of risks to employees as a result of work activities.  By law the employer has to assess the 'noise problem' at work then a risk assessment would need to be carried out and plan put in place for how to deal with it:

*identify where the risk is and who might be affected.
*contain a reliable estimate of the employees exposure and compare the exposure with the exposure limits and values
*identify what is needed to comply with the law i.e. whether noise control measures or hearing protection may be needed.
*identify any employees who may need to be provided with 'health surveillance' and whether any are at particular risk.

==Prosecutions arising from the regulations==
In October 2011 a factory in [[Burnley]] which manufactured flooring surfaces for horse riding centers was fined £16,000 after it failed to put practical measures in place to comply with an improvement notice from a specialist [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) inspector.&lt;ref name="Burnley hearing case" /&gt;  The staff at the factory worked several hours a day near a granulator machine, which shredded material into tiny pieces and which was "as loud as a chainsaw".&lt;ref name="Burnley hearing case" /&gt;  Although the court heard that some changes had been made, the daily exposure to employees working in the factory remained high.  HSE inspector Matthew Lea said "The Control of Noise at Work Regulations require employers to put measures in place to ensure that their employees can work safely, without putting their hearing at risk."&lt;ref name="Burnley hearing case" /&gt;  Speaking on the dangers of exposure to noise he said "Noise-induced hearing loss is a degenerative condition and the ear cannot repair itself. It's therefore important that employers take these dangers seriously as there is no going back once hearing is damaged."&lt;ref name="Burnley hearing case"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/press/2010/coi-nw-26equestrian.htm Health and Safety Executive | Burnley firm fined £16k after workers' hearing put at risk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Doctors Company claims to be the largest physician-owned medical malpractice insurer in the U.S, with 79,000 insureds nationwide, $4 billion in assets, $1.9 billion in member surplus, and a financial strength rating of A from [[A. M. Best]] and [[Fitch Group|Fitch Ratings]] in fiscal year 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedoctors.com/ecm/groups/public/@tdc/@web/documents/document/con_id_013330.pdf|title=2016 Financial Facts|last=|first=|date=June 2017|website=|publisher=The Doctors Company|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Founded in 1976, The Doctors Company operates as a member-owned interinsurance exchange, with a number of wholly owned subsidiaries, and is led by a 14-member Board of Governors.

In 2008, The Doctors Company merged with Los Angeles-based [[SCPIE Holdings, Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Merger lets Doctors cut malpractice-insurance rates |work= San Francisco Business Times |author= Chris Rauber |date= September 14, 2008 |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2008/09/15/newscolumn3.html |accessdate= September 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics''' (or '''THINCS''') is a group of scientists, physicians, and other academicians from around the world who dispute the widely accepted [[lipid hypothesis]] of [[atherosclerosis]]. THINCS was founded in January 2003, and its founder and current spokesman is [[Uffe Ravnskov]].

==Cholesterol controversy==
{{main|Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease}}
Since the 1950s, the lipid hypothesis (also known as the "Diet-Heart Idea"), which posits that [[saturated fat]] and high [[cholesterol]] play a role in the causation of [[atherosclerosis]] and [[cardiovascular disease]], has gained general acceptance in the medical and scientific communities. Currently, there is [[scientific consensus]] that the lipid hypothesis has been validated.&lt;ref name="partv"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steinberg D |title=Thematic review series: the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. An interpretive history of the cholesterol controversy, part V: the discovery of the statins and the end of the controversy |journal=J. Lipid Res. |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=1339–51 |year=2006 |pmid=16585781 |doi=10.1194/jlr.R600009-JLR200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brook J, Rifkind B |title=Cholesterol and coronary heart disease prevention--a transatlantic consensus |journal=Eur. Heart J. |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=702–11 |year=1989 |pmid=2676536}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=Consensus conference. Lowering blood cholesterol to prevent heart disease |journal=JAMA |volume=253 |issue=14 |pages=2080–6 |year=1985 |pmid=3974099|doi=10.1001/jama.253.14.2080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in 1984, a [[National Institutes of Health]] consensus development conference found that:
{{Quotation|It has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that lowering definitely elevated blood cholesterol levels (specifically, blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol) will reduce the risk of heart attacks caused by [[coronary artery disease|coronary heart disease]].&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;}}

The success of [[hypolipidemic agent|cholesterol-lowering medication]] such as [[statin]]s in preventing heart attacks has been seen as further validation of the lipid hypothesis.&lt;ref name="partv"/&gt;

THINCS members dispute this consensus and assert that the lipid hypothesis is not adequately proven by the evidence. They point to a number of studies which, in their view, either contradict the lipid hypothesis or show it to be inconclusive.

The THINCS website front page stated in June 2008:
{{Quotation|For decades, enormous human and financial resources have been wasted on the cholesterol campaign, more promising research areas have been neglected, producers and manufacturers of animal food all over the world have suffered economically, and millions of healthy people have been frightened and badgered into eating a tedious and flavorless diet or into taking potentially dangerous drugs for the rest of their lives. As the scientific evidence in support of the cholesterol campaign is non-existent, we consider it important to stop it as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thincs.org/ Thincs - The International network of cholesterol skeptics]. Accessed: 2008-06-15. (Archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5Yd5qUv4j)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The members of THINCS have various differing hypotheses on the actual causes of heart disease, but all agree however in rejecting the lipid hypothesis, which they claim has repeatedly failed to be validated by scientific testing and research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thincs.org www.thincs.org], main page. Accessed: 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

[[Harriet Hall]] in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' has noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is the International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics (THINCS), a group that disputes the role of cholesterol in cardiovascular disease. They are led by Uffe Ravnskov, author of ''The Cholesterol Myths'', and Malcolm Kendrick, author of ''The Great Cholesterol Con''. They cherry-pick the scientific literature to find studies that support their theses, ignore the flaws in those studies, and ignore the vast body of literature that contradicts them.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Harriet. (2017). [https://www.csicop.org/si/show/statin_denialism "Statin Denialism"]. ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''. Retrieved November 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:BRAM-COR-VAPOR-COMPRESSION-DISTILLER.jpg|thumb|Vapor compression distiller made by BRAM-COR (Italy)]]
'''Vapor-compression evaporation''' is the [[evaporation]] method by which a [[Centrifugal fan|blower]], [[gas compressor|compressor]] or jet ejector is used to [[Gas compression|compress]], and thus, increase the pressure of the vapor produced. Since the pressure increase of the vapor also generates an increase in the [[condensation]] temperature,  the same vapor can serve as the heating medium for its "mother" liquid or solution being concentrated, from which the vapor was generated to begin with. If no compression was provided, the vapor would be at the same temperature as the boiling liquid/solution, and no [[heat transfer]] could take place.

It is also sometimes called ''vapor compression distillation (VCD)''.  If compression is performed by a mechanically driven compressor or blower, this evaporation process is usually referred to as '''MVR''' (mechanical vapor recompression). In case of compression performed by high pressure motive [[steam]] [[injector|ejectors]], the process is usually called '''thermocompression''' or '''steam compression'''.

==MVR process==

===Energy input===
In this case the energy input to the system lies in the pumping energy of the compressor. The theoretical energy consumption will be equal to
&lt;math&gt;E=Q*(H2-H1)&lt;/math&gt;, where
* E is the total theoretical pumping energy
* Q is the mass of vapors passing through the compressor
* H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the total heat content of unit mass of vapors, respectively upstream and downstream the compressor.
In [[SI]] units, these are respectively measured in [[Joule|kJ]], [[kg]] and kJ/kg.

The actual energy input will be greater than the theoretical value and will depend on the efficiency of the system, which is usually between 30% and 60%. For example, suppose the theoretical energy input is 300 kJ and the efficiency is 30%. The actual energy input would be 300 x 100/30 = 1,000 kJ.

In a large unit, the compression power is between 35 and 45 [[kW]] per metric ton of compressed vapors.{{clarify|date=January 2015}}

===Equipment for MVR evaporators===
The compressor is necessarily the core of the unit. Compressors used for this application are usually of the [[centrifugal compressor|centrifugal]] type, or [[positive displacement pump|positive displacement]] units such as the [[Roots blower]]s, similar to the (much smaller) [[Roots type supercharger]]. Very large units (evaporation capacity 100 metric tons per hour or more) sometimes use [[Axial-flow compressor]]s. The compression work will deliver the steam [[superheated steam|superheated]] if compared to the theoretical pressure/temperature equilibrium. For this reason, the vast majority of MVR units feature a [[superheating|desuperheater]] between the compressor and the main heat exchanger. &lt;!-- Why desuperheat it? This would waste the energy put in by compression. --&gt;

==Thermocompression==

===Energy input===
&lt;!-- The word "quantity" is inexact. It probably means mass but it might be taken to mean volume. --&gt;
The energy input is here given by the energy of a quantity of steam ('''motive steam'''), at a pressure higher than those of both the inlet and the outlet vapors.
The quantity of compressed vapors is therefore higher than the inlet :
&lt;math&gt;Qd = Qs + Qm&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Where Q&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is the steam quantity at ejector delivery, Q&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; at ejector suction and Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the motive steam quantity. For this reason, a thermocompression evaporator often features a vapor [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], due to the possible excess of steam necessary for the compression if compared with the steam required to evaporate the solution.
The quantity Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of motive steam per unit suction quantity is a function of both the ''motive ratio'' of motive steam pressure vs. suction pressure and the [[compression ratio]] of delivery pressure vs. suction pressure. In principle, the higher the compression ratio and the lower the motive ratio the higher will be the specific motive steam consumption, i. e. the less efficient the energy balance.

===Thermocompression equipment===
The heart of any thermocompression evaporator is clearly the [[injector|steam ejector]], exhaustively described in the relevant page. The size of the other pieces of equipment, such as the main [[heat exchanger]], the [[vapor head]], etc. (see [[evaporator]] for details), is governed by the evaporation process.

==Comparison==
These two compression-type evaporators have different fields of application, although they do sometimes overlap.
* An MVR unit will be preferable for a large unit, thanks to the reduced energy consumption. The largest single body MVR evaporator built (1968, by Whiting Co., later Swenson Evaporator Co., Harvey, Ill. in [[Cirò Marina]], [[Italy]]) was a [[sodium chloride|salt]] [[crystallizer]], evaporating approximately 400 metric tons per hour of water, featuring an axial-flow compressor (Brown Boveri, later ABB). This unit was transformed around 1990 to become the first effect of a [[multiple effect evaporator]]. MVR evaporators with 10 tons or more evaporating capacity are common.
* The compression ratio in a MVR unit does not usually exceed 1.8. At a compression ratio of 1.8, if the evaporation is performed at atmospheric pressure (0.101 [[MPa]]), the condensation pressure after compression will be 0.101 x 1.8 = 0.1818 [MPa]. At this pressure, the condensation temperature of the water vapor at the heat exchanger will be 390 [[Kelvin|K]]. Taking into account the [[boiling point elevation]] of the salt water we wish to evaporate (8 K for a saturated salt solution), this leaves a temperature difference of less than 8 K at the heat exchanger. A small ∆T leads to slow heat transfer, meaning that we will need a very large heating surface to transfer the required heat. Axial-flow and Roots compressor may reach slightly higher compression ratios.
* Thermocompression evaporators may reach higher compression ratios - at a cost. A compression ratio of 2 is possible (and sometimes more) but unless the motive steam is at a reasonably high pressure (say, 16 [[bar (unit)|bar]] g - 250 [[psig]] - or more), the motive steam consumption will be in the range of 2&amp;nbsp;kg per kg of suction vapors. A higher compression ratio means a smaller heat exchanger, and a reduced investment cost. Moreover, a compressor is an expensive machine, while an ejector is much simpler and cheap.
As a conclusion, MVR machines are used in large, energy-efficient units, while thermocompression units tend to limit their use to small units, where energy consumption is not a big issue.

==Efficiency==
The efficiency and feasibility of this process depends on the efficiency of the compressing device (e.g., blower, compressor or steam ejector) and the [[heat transfer coefficient]] attained in the [[heat exchanger]] contacting the condensing vapor and the boiling "mother" solution/liquid. Theoretically, if the resulting condensate is [[subcooled]], this process could allow full recovery of the [[latent heat of vaporization]] that would otherwise be lost if the vapor, rather than the condensate, was the final product; therefore, this method of evaporation is very energy efficient.  The [[evaporation]] process may be solely driven by the mechanical work provided by the compressing device.

==Some uses==

===Clean water production ([[Water for injection]])===
A vapor-compression evaporator, like most [[evaporator]]s, can make reasonably clean water from any water source. In a [[salt]] crystallizer, for example, a typical analysis of the resulting condensate shows a typical content of residual salt not higher than 50 [[Parts per million|ppm]] or, in terms of [[electrical conductance]], not higher than 10 [[siemens (unit)|μS/cm]].&lt;!-- Should this be per centimetre cube? --&gt; This results in a drinkable water, if the other sanitary requirements are fulfilled. While this cannot compete in the marketplace with [[reverse osmosis]] or [[Desalination|demineralization]], vapor compression chiefly differs from these thanks to its ability to make clean water from saturated or even crystallizing brines with [[total dissolved solids]] (TDS) up to 650 g/L.  The other two technologies can make clean water from sources no higher in TDS than approximately 35 g/L.

For economic reasons evaporators are seldom operated on low-TDS water sources.  Those applications are filled by reverse osmosis.  The already brackish water which enters a typical evaporator is concentrated further. The increased dissolved solids act to increase the [[boiling point]] well beyond that of pure water. [[Seawater]] with a TDS of approximately 30 g/L exhibits a boiling point elevation of less than 1 [[Kelvin|K]] but saturated [[sodium chloride]] solution at 360 g/L has a boiling point elevation of about 7 K. This boiling point elevation represents a challenge for vapor-compression evaporation in that it increases the pressure ratio that the steam compressor must attain to effect vaporization.  Since boiling point elevation determines the pressure ratio in the compressor, it is the main overall factor in operating costs.

===Steam-assisted gravity drainage===

The technology used today to extract bitumen from the [[Athabasca oil sands]] is the water-intensive [[steam-assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD) method.&lt;ref name="airwaterland"&gt;{{citation |work=Air Water Land |date=October 2008 |accessdate=11 December 2014 |title=Watershed moment: SAGD operators embrace new water treatment options |first= Maurice |last=Smith |url=http://www.airwaterland.ca/article.asp?id=7354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s former nuclear engineer Bill Heins of [[General Electric Company]]'s RCC Thermal Products conceived an evaporator technology called falling film or mechanical vapor compression evaporation. In 1999 and 2002 [[Petro-Canada]]’s MacKay River facility was the first to install 1999 and 2002 GE SAGD [[zero-liquid discharge]] (ZLD) systems using a combination of the new evaporative technology and [[crystallizer system]] in which all the water was recycled and only solids were discharged off site.&lt;ref name="airwaterland" /&gt; This new evaporative technology began to replace older water treatment techniques employed by SAGD facilities which involved the use of warm [[lime softening]] to remove [[silica]] and [[magnesium]] and weak acid cation [[ion exchange]] used to remove [[calcium]].&lt;ref name="airwaterland" /&gt; The vapor-compression evaporation process replaced the [[Heat recovery steam generator|once-through steam generators]] (OTSG) traditionally used for steam production. OTSG generally ran on [[natural gas]] which in 2008 had become increasingly valuable. The water quality of evaporators is four times better &lt;!-- better in what way? --&gt;which is needed for the drum boilers. The evaporators, when coupled with standard drum boilers, produce steam which is more "reliable, less costly to operate, and less water-intensive." By 2008 about 85 per cent of SAGD facilities in the Alberta oil sands had adopted evaporative technology. "SAGD, unlike other thermal processes such as [[Steam injection (oil industry)|cyclic steam stimulation]] (CSS), requires 100 per cent quality steam."&lt;ref name="airwaterland" /&gt; &lt;!-- What does 100% quality steam mean? --&gt;

The act was intended "to amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] so as to strengthen the [[National Cancer Institute]] in order to more effectively carry out the national effort against [[cancer]]".&lt;ref name=NCAo71 /&gt;
It was signed into law by President Nixon on December 23, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Health activist and philanthropist [[Mary Lasker]] was instrumental in persuading the [[United States Congress]] to pass the National Cancer Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer| last=Mukherjee| first=Siddhartha| isbn=978-1-4391-0795-9 | oclc=464593321| date=2010 | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband [[Albert Lasker]] were strong supporters of medical research. They established the Lasker Foundation which awarded people for their research. In the year of 1943, Mary Lasker began changing the American Cancer Society to get more funding for research.  Five years later she contributed to getting federal funding for the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart Institute. In 1946 the funding was around $2.8 million and had grown to over $1.4 billion by 1972.  In addition to all of these accomplishments, Mary became the president of the Lasker Foundation due to the death of her husband in 1952. Lasker's devotion to medical research and experience in the field eventually contributed to the passing of the National Cancer Act.&lt;ref name="Credo Reference"&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Esther|title=LASKER, Mary Woodard Reinhardt.

Their plan would provide additional funding for:

President Obama's [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009 economic stimulus package]] includes $10 billion for the [[NIH]], which funds much of the [[cancer research]] in the U.S., and he has pledged to increase federal funding for cancer research by a third for the next two years as part of a drive to find "a cure for cancer in our time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A 2010 report from the [[American Cancer Society]] found that death rates for all cancers combined decreased 1.3% per year from 2001 to 2006 in males and 0.5% per year from 1998 to 2006 in females, largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colorectum) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). Cancer death rates between 1990 and 2006 for all races combined decreased by 21.0% among men and by 12.3% among women. This reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. Despite these reductions, the report noted, cancer still accounts for more deaths than [[heart disease]] in persons younger than 85 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Challenges===
A multitude of factors have been cited as impeding progress in finding a cure for cancer&lt;ref name=Hughes2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Begley2008/&gt; and key areas have been identified and suggested as important to accelerate progress in cancer research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since there are many different forms of cancer with distinct causes, each form requires different treatment approaches. However, this research could still lead to therapies and cures for many forms of cancer. Some of the factors that have posed challenges for the development of [[Cancer#Prevention|preventive]] measures and anti-cancer drugs and therapies include the following:

In a cancer research funding announcement made by president Obama in September 2009, TCGA project is slated to receive $175 million in funding to collect comprehensive gene sequence data on 20,000 tissue samples from people with more than 20 different types of cancer, in order to help researchers understand the genetic changes underlying cancer. New, targeted therapeutic approaches are expected to arise from the insights resulting from such studies.&lt;ref name=obamaSep09 /&gt;

====Cancer Genome Project====
The [[Cancer Genome Project]] at the [[Sanger Institute|Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]] aims to identify [[genetic variation|sequence variant]]s/[[mutation]]s critical in the development of human [[cancer]]s. The Cancer Genome Project combines knowledge of the [[human genome]] sequence with [[high-throughput screening|high throughput mutation detection]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Cancer research supportive infrastructure===
Advances in [[information technology]] supporting cancer research, such as the [[National Cancer Institute|NCI]]'s [[caBIG]] project, promise to improve data sharing among cancer researchers and accelerate "the discovery of new approaches for the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and [[Cancer#Prevention|prevention]] of cancer, ultimately improving patient outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Modern cancer treatment==

===Cancer clinical trials===
Researchers are considering ways to improve the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and overall success rate of cancer clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title= Improving the Quality of Cancer Clinical Trials: Workshop Summary

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased participation in rigorously designed clinical trials would increase the pace of research.  Currently, about 3% of people with cancer participate in clinical trials; more than half of them are patients for whom no other options are left, patients who are participating in "exploratory" trials designed to burnish the researchers' résumés or promote a drug rather than to produce meaningful information, or in trials that will not enroll enough patients to produce a [[statistically significant]] result.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Targeted tumor treatment===
A major challenge in cancer treatment is to find better ways to specifically target tumors with drugs and [[chemotherapy|chemotherapeutic agents]] in order to provide a more effective, localized dose and to minimize exposure of healthy tissue in other parts of the body to the potentially adverse effects of the treatments. The accessibility of different tissues and organs to anti-tumor drugs contributes to this challenge. For example, the [[blood–brain barrier]] blocks many drugs that may otherwise be effective against brain tumors. In November 2009, a new, experimental therapeutic approach for treating [[glioblastoma]] was published in which the anti-tumor drug [[Avastin]] was delivered to turmor site within the brain through the use of [[catheter|microcatheters]], along with [[mannitol]] to temporarily open the blood–brain barrier permitting delivery of the chemotherapy into the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Public education and support==
An important aspect to the war on cancer is improving public access to educational and supportive resources, to provide individuals with the latest information about cancer [[Cancer#Prevention|prevention]] and [[Management of cancer|treatment]], as well as access to support communities. Resources have been created by governmental and other organizations to provide support for cancer patients, their families and caregivers, to help them share information and find advice to guide decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
