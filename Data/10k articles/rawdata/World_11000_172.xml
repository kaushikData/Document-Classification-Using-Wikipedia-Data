'''42nd Motorized Infantry Battalion''' is a formation of the [[Ukrainian Ground Forces]]. It was originally formed as the '''42nd [[Territorial defence battalions (Ukraine)|Territorial Defence Battalion]] "Rukh Oporu"''' (from {{lang-ua|Рух опору}} — [[Resistance movement]]) in [[Kirovohrad]].

The battalion fought in the [[War in Donbass]].

== History ==
In August 2014 the battalion was involved in an attempt of Ukrainian command to deblock [[Battle of Ilovaisk|encircled forces near Ilovaisk]]. The assault squad was formed that had 90 soldiers. It was sent from [[Kramatorsk]] in direction of Ilovaisk, after it became clear Russian military forces approached Ilovaisk. The unit was supposed to meet a company tactical group of [[92nd Mechanized Brigade (Ukraine)|92nd Mechanized Brigade]] and try to breach Russian encirclement. The squad arrived on 27 August to [[Dokuchaievsk]] city where it was beefed with 2 [[Infantry fighting vehicle|IFV]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and advanced towards Ilovaisk. The column stopped in the field for a night and shortly after it was hit by heavy artillery shelling. The next morning it was completely defeated by Russian paratroopers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tyzhden.ua/Society/146208|title=Серпень 2014. Іловайськ. Частина ІІІ.

'''[http://afghan-tvs.com Afghan TV]''' is a commercial [[television station]], based in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] since 21 May 2004. The station is owned by Ahmed Shah Afghanzai, an Afghan [[entrepreneur]]. It originally broadcast for 18 hours daily, but has been 24-hours since July 2004.

==Programs==
Afghan TV has lots of [[entertainment]] programs, including [[sport]], [[social]] and [[educational]]. It also has [[India]]n, [[United States|American]], [[Korea]]n and [[Arabic]] [[drama]]. It also broadcasts [[news]], although this is also broadcast 24 hours a day on its [[sister channel]], [[Afghan News]].

==2006 fining==
In early 2006, the station was fined 50,000 AFN ([[Afghan afghani|Afghani]]) (approximately [[US$]]1,000) by the [[Supreme Court of Afghanistan|Afghan Supreme Court]], after it had broadcast what the court called inappropriate images, including adult content.

The case was televised by Afghan TV and was covered extensively by other media outlets, however, the powerful clergy in the country succeeded in not only instating the fine on Afghan TV, but also severely restricting the ability of other television networks to broadcast entertainment.

==Hotbird launch==
On 15 June 2011, Afghan TV was launched in on the [[Hotbird]] 13°E satellite, meaning that the whole of [[Europe]] now can receive Afghan TV. Viewers in the [[Middle East]] can now receive Afghan TV on two satellites: Hotbird 13°E and [[Turksat 3A]] 42°E.

On 27 June 2011, the name 'Afghan TV' (on Hotbird) was suddenly renamed to '[http://boxelet.com boxelet.com]'. It is unknown why this happened, even though the channel itself is Afghan TV and not Afghan News. Websites like KingOfSat state the channel as ''Afghan News TV'' and moved ''Afghan TV'' in the so-called channel cemetery.

On 1 July 2011, the channel started broadcasting in higher quality video on Hotbird, just like in Afghanistan.

===Closure===
On 23 December 2011, Afghan TV suddenly left Hotbird and ceased broadcasting on the satellite. They didn't put a notice on their website too. Viewers in west, north and central Europe are now unable to receive the channel. If you're in south or east Europe, you can still watch it via [[Express AM22]]. Also, central Europe viewers can get Express AM22 by a large and powerful satellite.

The '''Albert P. Crary Science and Engineering Center''' (CSEC), located at [[McMurdo Station]], was dedicated in November 1991 by the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF). The laboratory is named in honor of [[geophysicist]] and [[glaciologist]] [[Albert P. Crary]]. There are five pods making for 4,320 square meters of working area that includes a two-story core, a [[biology]] pod, earth sciences and atmospheric sciences pods, and an [[aquarium]]. CSEC was built to replace older, outdated science buildings that were built as early as 1959.&lt;ref name="NSF" /&gt;

==Facilities==
The second floor of CSEC has a computer room and a library, and also has the waste management, outdoor safety, and driving classes, the latter 2 of which are optional. It is required to take the outdoor safety and driving classes to be able to perform the activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3708">The '''Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union''' ({{lang-nl|Belgisch-Luxemburgse Economische Unie}}, {{lang-fr|Union économique belgo-luxembourgeoise}}, {{lang-lb|Belsch-Lëtzebuerger Wirtschaftsunioun}}), abbreviated to '''BLEU''' or '''UEBL''', is an [[economic union]] between [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]], two countries in the [[Benelux|Benelux Union]].

BLEU was created by a treaty, signed on 25 July 1921, despite a [[referendum]] against such a proposal, between Belgium and [[Luxembourg]], and came into effect upon ratification by the [[Chamber of Deputies (Luxembourg)|Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies]] on 22 December 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/LNTSer/1922/58.html|title=Belgium and Luxembourg - Convention for the establishment of an Economic Union between the two countries, signed at Brussels, July 25, 1921 [1922] LNTSer 58; 9 LNTS 223|work=worldlii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreins (2003), pp.92–3&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the treaty, the economic frontier was lifted and the [[Belgian franc]] and [[Luxembourg franc]] were set at a fixed parity (though revised in 1935 and 1944) establishing a [[monetary union]], which existed up until the introduction of the [[Euro]]. The original treaty lasted for fifty years, expiring in 1972; this was extended for ten years in 1982 and again in 1992. On 18 December 2002, the two countries and the three [[regions of Belgium]] signed a new convention.

It has been seen as the forerunner of [[Benelux|Benelux Union]], which was established as the Benelux Customs Union in 1944 by the [[London Customs Convention]] and also includes the Netherlands. While many aims of the BLEU have been subsumed by the Benelux Union, and later the [[European Union]], it still has some relevance in being able to decide more precise measures than these organisations. International trade statistics were available for BLEU only as a combined entity until 1999, when European Community rules required split information.

== History ==
Compared with the [[Zollverein]], the UEBL had several advantages for Luxembourg. Belgium was only allowed to alter its customs tariffs or conclude trade treaties after consultation with the Luxembourgish government, whereas before 1918 Luxembourg had to go along with German decisions. Similarly, only Luxembourgish customs agents would operate in Luxembourg, while under the Zollverein Prussian officials had operated in Luxembourg. 

The functioning of the UEBL was entrusted to a Board of Directors consisting of two Belgian members (including the chairman) and one Luxembourgish member, and the Higher Council of the Union (with three Belgian and two Luxembourgish members).

He started his broadcasting career working for [[Piccadilly Radio]], [[Manchester]], as a teenager, before moving to London as a presenter for the BBC's [[BBC London 94.9|Greater London Radio]] and then [[Channel 4]] television, where ''[[The Big Breakfast]]'' made him a star. Soon he was able to dictate highly favourable terms, allowing him to broadcast on competing radio and TV stations. Slots like  the [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] Breakfast Show and ''[[TFI Friday]]'' provided a mix of celebrity interviews, music and comic games, delivered in an irreverent style that attracted high ratings, though often also generated significant numbers of complaints. By 2000 he was the UK's highest paid entertainer, according to the [[Sunday Times Rich List|''Sunday Times'' Rich List]]. In the tax year to April 2017, he was the BBC's highest paid presenter, earning between £2.2m and £2.25m annually.

In 2005, he started a new career on [[BBC Radio 2]], hosting [[Chris Evans Drivetime|his long-running Drivetime programme]], before moving in 2010 to host ''[[The Chris Evans Breakfast Show]]'' every weekday morning. He previously presented ''[[The One Show]]'' on Fridays between 2010 and 2015. Since 2011, he has co-hosted [[Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park]].  
 
In 2015, he signed a three-year deal to lead a new ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' line-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33158464 | work=BBC News | title=Chris Evans to be new Top Gear presenter | date=16 June 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616221431/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33158464 | archivedate=16 June 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presented a revival series of ''TFI Friday''.

On 4 July 2016, Evans announced that he would be stepping down as presenter of ''Top Gear''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36707266 |title=Chris Evans to step down as Top Gear presenter |publisher=BBC |date=4 July 2016 |accessdate=4 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704143150/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36707266 |archivedate=4 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans began his professional career at [[Piccadilly Radio]], Manchester, in 1983, where he had previously had unpaid schoolboy work.&lt;ref name="Fell2Earth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.northwestradio.info/memories/piccadilly-key-103/|title=Piccadilly 261|publisher=North West Radio|accessdate=23 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623071124/http://www.northwestradio.info/memories/piccadilly-key-103/|archivedate=23 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1984 Evans had three jobs: as an assistant to [[Timmy Mallett]], and playing a character on his show called 'Nobby Nolevel' ('No [[GCE Ordinary Level|'O' Level]]'); acting as a disc jockey in the evenings at local [[Public house|pubs]] when he was not at Piccadilly Radio; and still working at the newsagents, opening up daily at 5&amp;nbsp;am to sort out the newspaper deliveries.

Evans switched to a full-time position at the station in 1984, his new role including being driven around the Manchester area in the radio car to turn up at listeners' houses. In addition he was producer to presenter [[James H. Reeve]]. Following this he presented a weekday [[graveyard slot]] with competitions and segments where listeners had opportunities to sell their belongings on air.&lt;ref name="Fell2Earth"/&gt;

After working as a producer on [[Richard Branson]]'s service ''[[The Superstation]],'' where he produced material for [[Jonathan Ross]],&lt;ref name="Fell2Earth"/&gt; Evans went on to work at [[BBC]] London radio station [[BBC London 94.9|GLR]], first as a producer on [[Emma Freud]]'s mid-morning show, then ''Weekend Breakfast'' with [[Danny Baker]].&lt;ref name="TROTGP"/&gt; Evans became a GLR presenter in early 1990, taking over a Saturday afternoon show. Three months later, he started presenting ''The Greenhouse'', a Monday to Thursday evening show; he remained on this slot until the end of 1990.

In early 1991, as a result of his first regular TV hosting work presenting the ''Power Up'' breakfast show on [[The Power Station (TV channel)|The Power Station]] for [[British Satellite Broadcasting]], Evans moved to presenting ''Round at Chris's'', every Saturday morning from 10:00&amp;nbsp;am to 1:00&amp;nbsp;pm, which he continued to present until April 1993.

===Career success===
In addition to his Saturday morning show on [[BBC London 94.9|GLR]], in March 1992 Evans began presenting a Sunday afternoon show on [[BBC Radio 1]], replacing [[Phillip Schofield]]. His show, ''Too Much Gravy'', was broadcast from 14:30 to 16:00 and ended in September 1992. His move to Radio 1 was short-lived but seen as a huge success, with controller [[Johnny Beerling]] later admitting he wished he'd offered Evans a full-time show there and then. At the time, however, Evans objected that Radio 1 had attempted to constrain his style, preventing him from using the "[[Morning zoo|zoo]]" format, allegedly because [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] was already doing that on the station.

In April 1993, Evans left GLR and joined the new [[Virgin Radio]], to host a Saturday morning show.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===''The Big Breakfast''===
{{main|The Big Breakfast}}
Evans' departure from radio was in part so he could devote his time to the new [[Channel 4]] [[breakfast television]] show, ''[[The Big Breakfast]]'', from 28 September 1992. Evans co-hosted the show with [[Gaby Roslin]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Evans left ''The Big Breakfast'' on 29 September 1994 and formed his own television production company, [[Ginger Productions]]. Its first major programme, ''[[Don't Forget Your Toothbrush]]'', was broadcast between 1994 and 1995. The original concepts proved to be lucrative for Evans as its format was sold to numerous foreign broadcasters.&lt;ref name="TROTGP"/&gt;

===''The Radio 1 Breakfast Show''===
In April 1995, Evans returned to radio to host the [[flagship]] ''[[The Radio 1 Breakfast Show|Radio 1 Breakfast Show]]''. Evans negotiated into his contract with Radio 1 a clause allowing him to still make television programmes, and specifically an option to make a Friday night programme for [[Channel 4]]. A further clause required the Breakfast Show to be produced independently by Evans' Ginger company, rather than in-house by BBC Radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8241384.stm Red letter day for Chris Evans], bbc.co.uk, 11 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Allowed to create the "zoo" format he had previously been disallowed from performing on Radio 1, Evans was given a free rein by his friend, Radio 1 controller [[Matthew Bannister]]. Critics hated [[innuendo]]-laden features like Honk Your Horn and In Bed with Your Girlfriend, but Evans put on 600,000 new listeners over [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] – one for every [[pound sterling|£]]5 spent on salary and advertising. The effect also flowed through into the listening figures for later programmes. The audience grew as the breakfast format became more outrageous: humiliating assistant [[Holly Samos]] by repeatedly asking her about her sex life (Evans and Samos were reportedly in a relationship at periods through their time working together), and encouraging two female guests to perform a strip show on live radio.&lt;ref name="Telg1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1997/01/17/neva117.html |title=Rise and fall of Radio 1's gaffe-prone presenter |author=Boshoff, Alison |work=The Telegraph |date=17 January 1997 |accessdate=23 May 2008 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912084549/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1997%2F01%2F17%2Fneva117.html |archivedate=12 September 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's highest listening figure reached 7.5 million.&lt;ref name="ScotsMan1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/chrisevans/Evans-big-hangover.2439680.jp|title=Evans' big hangover|author=Synnot, Siobhan|work=The Scotsman|date=23 June 2003|accessdate=24 May 2008|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans began making editions of [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[TFI Friday]]'' from 1996. The show – devised, produced and hosted by Evans through his Ginger Media company – combined celebrity interviews, musical guests and daft games and competitions. Largely based on the successful formula of his radio show, it was initially a big success. However, as the success of both shows peaked, combined with a string of celebrity relationships and highly publicised nights drinking with friends [[Danny Baker]] and [[Paul Gascoigne]], the strain began to show, and a model emerged described as a "template for his approach to all his subsequent projects – an abundance of enthusiasm at the beginning which eventually falls prey to boredom and shiftlessness."&lt;ref name="ScotsMan1"/&gt;

Beginning to think he was indispensable at Radio 1, the first big falling-out with management came in December 1995 after taking his crew out on a 17-hour pub-crawl which ended two hours before they were due on air: Evans was fined one day's pay, £7,000.&lt;ref name="Telg1"/&gt; In 1996, broadcasting watchdogs investigated a continual trail of complaints against the show: Radio 1 refused to comment, Evans never said sorry. Evans also made increasing public demands of the Radio 1 management: after taking an extra week of unplanned holiday, Evans chose to turn up half an hour late for his 06:30 show and then demanded that his hours were changed so that it was a permanent fixture – this request was accepted.&lt;ref name="Telg1"/&gt;

However, after the summer break things got decidedly worse. Criticised by the broadcasting watchdog for a tasteless joke about [[Holocaust]] victim [[Anne Frank]], Evans countered with an item about [[haemorrhoids]].&lt;ref name="Telg1"/&gt; Asked by Bannister to watch the rules, Evans the next day branded Bannister "[[The Fat Controller]]".&lt;ref name="Telg1"/&gt; In November, Evans announced on air that he was medically unfit to be on the radio – Bannister re-negotiated his contract to double his holiday to twice that of other Radio 1 DJs. After more publicised public drinking and self-confessed illness, Evans' spell at the station ended in January 1997 when he quit after his demand not to host the show on Friday (to have a full day getting ready for his TV show) was not accepted.&lt;ref name="Telg1"/&gt;

''The Radio 1 Breakfast Show'' was taken over by [[Mark and Lard]] ([[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] and [[Marc Riley]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/28/mondaymediasection.radio|title=Made in Manchester|author=Plunkett, John|work=The Guardian|date=28 May 2007|accessdate=23 May 2008|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118183828/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/28/mondaymediasection.radio|archivedate=18 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Evans found out that they were a ratings disaster, he quickly got in touch with [[BBC Radio 1]] management to ask whether he could take back the show again.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Station management declined but did offer him a weekend slot, which he turned down. In response to the falling ratings, bosses decided to replace its presenters with the relatively unknown [[Kevin Greening]] and the well known children's TV presenter [[Zoë Ball]]. Their tenure started on 13 October 1997.

===Virgin Radio===
During a holiday in [[Killarney]], he listened to the Irish broadcaster [[Gerry Ryan]] on the radio. Evans claims the variety on Ryan's show made him want to return to radio.&lt;ref name="GerryRyan"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/he-rescued-my-radio-career-says-bbc-star-2162406.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802131334/http://www.independent.ie/national-news/he-rescued-my-radio-career-says-bbc-star-2162406.html|archive-date=2 August 2012|title=He rescued my career says BBC star|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|date=3 May 2010|accessdate=20 May 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans was then hired by [[Virgin Radio]] to host its breakfast show, prompting an immediate upsurge in station listening figures of 1.8&amp;nbsp;million to 2.6&amp;nbsp;million. His first show was on 13 October 1997, the same day as Kevin Greening and Zoë Ball on Radio 1. Starting at 7:00&amp;nbsp;am, Evans' crew presented the show from Monday to Friday, but without Evans participating on a Friday.

As [[Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson]] had decided to reduce his media holding, he began talks to sell the station to [[Capital Radio]] in a deal that would have given him 10% of holding company [[Capital Group]]. As this became public knowledge, Evans, who did not want to work for Capital, publicly dismissed them as "a bleating, blowing asthmatic dog."&lt;ref name="Man2Day"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/406973/uk-clown-media-mogul-tv-upstart-chris-evans-stunned-the-broadcasting-world-buying-/ |title=Can this clown be a media mogul? |publisher=[[Management Today]] |date=1 July 1999 |accessdate=23 May 2008 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December, with the assistance of investors, Evans' vehicle Ginger Media Group bought Virgin Radio from Branson for £85m, to control the interests both of Ginger Productions and Virgin Radio. Both [[Apax Partners]] and Branson each owned 20% of Ginger Media Group, while Evans and his investors owned the remaining 60%.&lt;ref name="BBCSale"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/601640.stm|title=Evans sells up|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=13 January 2000|accessdate=23 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031223173149/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/601640.stm|archivedate=23 December 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group later engaged in the prospect of buying the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' newspaper, but decided against from commercial angles.&lt;ref name="Man2Day"/&gt;

===Sale of GMG – dismissal and legal cases===
On 14 March 2000, Evans agreed the sale of Ginger Media Group to [[SMG plc]] for £225m.&lt;ref name="BBCSale"/&gt; The sale made Evans the highest paid entertainer in the UK in 2000, estimated by the [[Sunday Times Rich List]] to have been paid around £35.5million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1029072.stm|title=Evans tops UK showbiz earners|publisher=BBC News|date=18 November 2000|accessdate=23 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703143135/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1029072.stm|archivedate=3 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following poor reviews of ''TFI Friday,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/307122.stm|title=Channel 4's TFI a 'turn-off'|publisher=BBC News|date=29 March 1999|accessdate=23 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703141802/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/307122.stm|archivedate=3 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Evans himself handing over presentation of the last series to a series of "friends", the show was cancelled in December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1082844.stm|title=The rise and fall of TFI|publisher=BBC News|date=22 December 2000|accessdate=23 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703143207/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1082844.stm|archivedate=3 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans continued to host the station's breakfast show, but echoes of his earlier dismissal from Radio 1 began to emerge. In May 2000, the station was fined £75,000 (then the largest penalty imposed by the [[Radio Authority]]) for his repeated on-air endorsement of [[Ken Livingstone]] in the [[London mayoral election, 2000|London mayoral elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/may/16/londonmayor.uk|title=£75,000 fine for Evans line on Livingstone|work=the Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601175817/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/may/16/londonmayor.uk|archivedate=1 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virgin Radio's new programme controller Paul Jackson, in light of audience figures which had dropped from a peak of 2.7&amp;nbsp;million to 1.7&amp;nbsp;million, had pruned Evans's "zoo" team and installed a music policy which replaced more eclectic choices with a strict diet of chart pop. As a result, on 20 June Evans was followed throughout the day by [[tabloid newspaper]] photographers, and undertook an "18-hour bender" which started after his show at 9.30 in the morning, and ended – after numerous pints of [[Kronenbourg]] and [[Guinness]], plus five bottles of [[Dom Pérignon (wine)|Dom Pérignon]] – with Evans asleep in front of a [[Lap dance|lap-dancer]] at [[Stringfellows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2001/07/01/do10.xml |title=Ginger binger |work=The Telegraph |date=1 July 2001|accessdate=23 May 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later photographed by the tabloids that week with new wife [[Billie Piper]] in the nearest pub to their home in [[Hascombe]], Surrey&lt;ref name="4ME"/&gt; while claiming he was too ill to present his show,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3022702.stm|title=Timeline: Chris Evans and Virgin|publisher=BBC News|date=26 June 2003|accessdate=20 June 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307090513/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3022702.stm|archivedate=7 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was dismissed on 28 June 2001 for repeatedly failing to arrive at work. Evans was replaced by the older [[Steve Penk]], whom Evans criticised for his age – 39 versus Evans's then 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/1418594.stm|title=Penk replaces Evans at Virgin Radio|publisher=BBC News|date=2 July 2001|accessdate=23 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040225014323/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/1418594.stm|archivedate=25 February 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans attempted to sue Virgin Radio, claiming that he was unfairly dismissed and denied share options worth £8.6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1711049.stm|title=Evans sues for lost Virgin shares|publisher=BBC News|date=14 December 2001|accessdate=23 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040716162336/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1711049.stm|archivedate=16 July 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June 2003, in the judgement of ''Evans v SMG Television Ltd. &amp; Ors'' 2003 EWHC 1423 (Ch), Justice Lightman found that he had been fairly dismissed and was not entitled to the share options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2003/1423.html&amp;query=virgin+radio&amp;method=all|title=Christopher Evans v SMG Television et al.|publisher=Royal Courts of Justice|date=23 June 2003|accessdate=24 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving his ruling at the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], Evans was publicly criticised for his attitude by the judge, who said of Evans: "He has the temperament of a prima donna."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3020130.stm|title=Evans loses £8.6m damages case|publisher=BBC News|date=23 June 2003|accessdate=24 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215003505/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3020130.stm|archivedate=15 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virgin Radio/SMG later countersued, with Evans ordered to pay £1m towards their legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3039010.stm|title=Evans must pay Virgin £1m|publisher=BBC News|date=2 July 2003|accessdate=24 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040630125742/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3039010.stm|archivedate=30 June 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, Evans writes that shortly after the sale of Virgin Radio he was offered £56m for his SMG shares by Goldman Sachs. He declined the offer and eventually sold them for £250,000.

===UMTV===
In August 2002 Chris Evans set up a radio and television production company, [[UMTV (production)|UMTV]], with the aim of specialising in live, cutting-edge, entertainment programming. Over the next 3 years UMTV produced more than 375 hours of television, with mixed success. TV shows included ''[[Boys and Girls (TV series)|Boys and Girls]]'' hosted by [[Vernon Kay]] for Channel 4,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2979038.stm|title=Evans' game show given chop|publisher=BBC News|date=10 June 2003|accessdate=24 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109192531/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2979038.stm|archivedate=9 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Johnny Vegas]]: [[18 Stone of Idiot]]'' for Channel 4 / [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]]; ''[[OFI Sunday]]'' for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4250348.stm|title=Live TV comeback for Chris Evans|publisher=BBC News|date=15 September 2005|accessdate=24 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427004902/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4250348.stm|archivedate=27 April 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Live with [[Christian O'Connell]]'' and ''[[Live with Chris Moyles]]'' for [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]];&lt;ref name="4ME"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2111850.stm|title=Evans signs £4m chat show deal|publisher=BBC News|date=7 July 2002|accessdate=23 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302054734/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2111850.stm|archivedate=2 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[BAFTA]] award-winning ''School of Hard Knocks'' for 4 Learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3753555.stm|title=Host Evans 'back for schools TV'|publisher=BBC News|date=27 May 2004|accessdate=24 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following two high-profile shows which failed to perform in the ratings, UMTV hired [[Terry Wogan]] and Evans' former ''Big Breakfast'' co-host [[Gaby Roslin]] to host a weekday morning magazine show, ''[[The Terry and Gaby Show]].'' Evans said publicly that if this show failed he would set up a market stall. Despite critical acclaim the audience numbers never took off and Channel 5 axed the show after its year-long run, citing its high cost as a reason. True to his word, Evans was pictured at the end of the final show with a market stall and later he opened it for real at [[Stables Market]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]].&lt;ref name="Market"/&gt;

===Radio 2===
[[File:Chris and joss.jpg|thumb|right|Evans and [[Joss Stone]] in 2005]]
Evans re-entered public life in early 2005, presenting the breakfast slot of [[UK Radio Aid]]'s day of programming for the victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Asian tsunami]], which was aired on most of the UK's [[commercial radio]] stations, and also [[The BRIT Awards]] in 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4036423.stm|title=Chris Evans returns as Brits host|publisher=BBC News|date=23 November 2004|accessdate=24 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307220508/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4036423.stm|archivedate=7 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From April 2005, Evans presented a number of one-off [[Bank Holiday]] shows for [[BBC Radio 2]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4321917.stm|title=Evans to return to BBC airwaves|publisher=BBC News|date=5 March 2005|accessdate=24 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121203103/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4321917.stm|archivedate=21 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; including coverage of the [[Live 8 concert, London|Live 8 concert in London]].

====Saturday afternoon show====
Evans then joined Radio 2 on a permanent basis in September 2005, presenting a weekly Saturday afternoon show from 14:00 to 17:00. His first show featured singer [[Robbie Williams]], and accompanied by a posse including friend "Big" Pete Winterbottom and newsreader [[Andrew Peach]]. Evans told listeners to his first show: "We've had a couple of test drives over the summer and we've decided to take it. Yes, we like this vehicle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4255812.stm|title=Chris Evans starts Radio 2 show|publisher=BBC News|date=17 September 2005|accessdate=24 May 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050922061223/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4255812.stm|archivedate=22 September 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Move to ''Drivetime''====

====The Chris Evans Breakfast Show====
{{Main|The Chris Evans Breakfast Show}}
Evans took over [[The Chris Evans Breakfast Show|Radio 2 breakfast show]] on 11 January 2010, succeeding Sir [[Terry Wogan]] and eventually also [[Sarah Kennedy]]. While Evans replaced Wogan owing to his long-planned retirement, the circumstances of the latter remain controversial and supporters of Kennedy allege there was a deliberate intention to force her out so Evans' show could be lengthened.  His first three songs were [[The Beatles]]' "[[All You Need Is Love]]" and "[[Got to Get You into My Life]]"; and [[Frank Sinatra]]'s "[[Come Fly with Me (1957 song)|Come Fly with Me]]". His co-presenters include ex-BBC TV newsreader [[Moira Stuart]], sports presenter [[Jonny Saunders]] who was replaced in June 2011 by [[Vassos Alexander]], and travel reporter [[Lynn Bowles]]. Features include The Gobsmackers (two songs selected by a listener that sound good played back to back).

On 3 September 2018, Evans announced live on air that he would be leaving the show and the station in December for [[Virgin Radio UK|Virgin Radio]].&lt;ref name="BBC Chris Evans leaving"/&gt; on 11 September the BBC Director General [[Tony Hall, Baron Hall of Birkenhead|Lord Tony Hall]] told the [[House of Commons]] Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that. as well as wanting a new challenge. releasing the salaries of those at the BBC earning more than 150k had been a contributing factor in Evans' leaving. A month later, Evans confirmed live on air that [[Zoë Ball]] would replace him on the show from January 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45482646|title=BBC pay reveal 'a factor' in Evans' exit|date=11 September 2018|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sony Music Radio Personality of the Year===
In May 2006, Evans was named music radio personality of the year at the annual [[Sony Radio Academy Awards]], defeating rivals [[Jamie Theakston]], [[Lauren Laverne]], [[Marc Riley]] and [[Tim Lovejoy]] to win.

===Return to television===
After his success in the 1990s, Evans' attempts at a TV comeback in the 21st century have been mixed with a record of poor ratings and cancellations, including falling viewing figures for his recent role as co-host of Friday editions of ''The One Show''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} In November and December 2005 Evans presented ''[[OFI Sunday]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

Since 1991 P2 has organized a [[chamber music]] competition for promising young musicians, held every 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kammermusik live og i radioen|url=http://www.musikeren.dk/nyheder/nyhed/artikel/p2_kammermusikkonkurrence_live_og_i_radioen/|accessdate=6 April 2017|publisher=Musikeren|date=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 1 October 1951 the then ''Statsradiofonien'' launched their second radio station, called ''Program 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DANMARKS RADIO 1925-|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/danmarks-radio-1925/|website=Danmarkshistorien.dk|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 Statsradiofonien changed its name to '''Danmarks Radio''', and to '''DR''' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIDSLINJE: Fra Statsradiofonien til DR|url=http://www.billedbladet.dk/kendte/danmark/tv/dr/tidslinje-fra-statsradiofonien-til-dr|website=Billedbladet.dk|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 Danmarks Radio started regional programming on P2 in the evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dansk radio historie|url=http://danskradio.dk/historien.html|website=Dansk Radio|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station switched to nationwide stereo output on 1 October 1969 after some regional trials.
Classical music was first broadcast on the station in 1980 during the evenings when the regional programming took over the daytime schedule.

DR had in 2001 won the rights to use Denmark's new fourth nationwide FM channel to which the station was moved and re-launched as DR P2 Musik &amp; Kultur on 1 September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nielsen|first1=Stig Hartvig|title=I dag starter Danmarks nye 4. lands-dækkende FM kanal: "P2 Musik &amp; Kultur"|url=http://www.radionytarkiv.dk/artikel/default.asp?id=2808|accessdate=6 April 2017|publisher=radionyt.com|date=1 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional programming stayed on the former P2 regional channels and was re-launched as [[DR P4]].

DR subsequently lost the rights to continue the use of the fourth nationwide FM channel from 2011, which meant DR only had room for three of their four FM channels. DR therefore decided that [[DR P1|P1]] and P2 must share the nationwide FM channel that P1 had been using, starting on 1 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=P2 flytter ind hos P1 på FM|url=https://www.dr.dk/presse/p2-flytter-ind-hos-p1-paa-fm|accessdate=6 April 2017|publisher=DR|date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day DR P2 became ''DR P2 Klassisk''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meget mindre klassisk musik på DR fra 1. november|url=http://www.radionytarkiv.dk/artikel/default.asp?id=18753|accessdate=6 April 2017|publisher=radionyt.com|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both channels continued as two separate channels digitally on [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] and [[Internet radio|online]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=P1 og P2 fortsætter som digital radio|url=http://www.dr.dk/Temaer/digitalradio/artikler/20120305204950.htm|accessdate=6 April 2017|publisher=DR|date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013 DR P2 Klassisk changed name to its current name DR P2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hvor er DR P2 Klassisk blevet af?|url=http://www.dr.dk/Om_DR/Kontakt+DR/Spoergsmaal+og+svar/Radio/20130403110250.htm|publisher=DR|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 2017 P2 became available on [[Digital_audio_broadcasting#DAB.2B_2|DAB+]] radio when a nationwide switch-over took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Overgangen til DAB+ udsat til 1. oktober 2017|url=http://danskemedier.dk/nyhed/overgangen-til-dab-udsat-til-1-oktober-2017/|accessdate=8 April 2017|agency=Danske Medier|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Die Matie''' is a student newspaper at the [[University of Stellenbosch]]. Founded in 1941, '''Die Matie''' is published every second Wednesday during the academic term. The editorial content includes sections on news, student life, sport, arts and entertainment, current affairs and news from other campuses. The entire production of '''Die Matie''' – from photos, articles and advertisements to page layout and distribution – is managed by the editorial staff; all students.

== History ==
On August 1, 1941, the first issue of '''Die Matie''' student newspaper was published in Stellenbosch.

== Distribution ==
8,000 copies of the newspaper are distributed on the main campus of Stellenbosch, as well as on the three satellite campuses, the medical campus at [[Tygerberg]], military campus at [[Saldanha Bay|Saldanha]] and business school in [[Bellville, Western Cape|Bellville]]. '''Die Matie''' has an estimated readership of 16 000 students, staff and Stellenbosch residents. In addition to print the paper is also published electronically though an online archive.

== Structure ==
With every edition of '''Die Matie''' a pre-elected editorial team member has the responsibility of compiling a supplement, either on: motoring, lifestyle, travel, science &amp; technology and health.
The editor of this supplement is expected to gather advertisements for the supplement (as ads pay for the printing of the supplement), the collection of editorial content, photos and for the layout of the supplement.

== Financing ==
Although '''Die Matie''' receives a small subsidy from Stellenbosch University's Student Affairs Department, all printing costs and some of the office upkeep is covered by advertisements, which are the responsibility of '''Die Matie''''s advertising manager (also a student and member of the editorial team).

The band "The Rocketz" played in a school event. Farel member band (Adipati Dolken), Bevan (Aditya Suryo) and Endo (Joshua Otay) managed to make their high school female students in hysterics at his appearance.

The proper '''Islamic bicycle''' for the [[Women in Islam|Muslim women]] is a topic of heated discussion in both [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] Islam. Concerns centre around [[Modesty#Islamic modesty|modesty]] (not revealing the body) and mobility (social control).

Theologian and philosopher Alparslan Acikgenc addressed the issue in a conference in [[Istanbul]], saying "a bicycle that is produced with God’s blessings in mind and man’s interests at its fore is an Islamic bicycle". Secular academics worry that [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Turkey’s Islamist government]] is putting [[Islamic attitudes towards science|Islam ahead of science]]. Turkish journalist [[Mustafa Akyol]] argues that the very idea of an Islamic bicycle is indicative of a "mentality that has stagnated Muslim thought".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562945|title=Peddling religion: Why secular academics fret about an “Islamic bicycle”|date=Sep 15, 2012|newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women%27s_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia#Mobility|Saudi Arabia bans the use of bicycles by women]] except in restricted recreational areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2013/04/03/saudi-women-can-now-ride-bicycles-in-public-kind-of/|title=Saudi Women Can Now Ride Bicycles in Public (Kind of)|date=April 3, 2013|work=Time Magazine|author=Kristene Quan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian version of the bicycle has a “boxy contraption that hides a woman’s lower body.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/weekinreview/09slackman.html|title=Molding the Ideal Islamic Citizen|date=Sep 9, 2007|author=Michael Slackman|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iran it is forbidden for women to ride traditional bicycles out of concerns for [[Modesty#Islamic modesty|modesty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Theodoulou |title=Women cyclists face jail, warns Iranian police chief |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/women-cyclists-face-jail-warns-iranian-police-chief |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date=24 October 2010 |accessdate=8 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women riders are attacked by [[vigilante]]s.

'''Jamhuri Jazz Band''' was founded in late 1950s in [[Tanga, Tanzania]] when the country was known as [[Tanganyika]]. It was one of the more popular Tanzanian musical groups. Jamhuri Jazz played a key role in the spread of the [[Soukous|Congolese rumba]] sound throughout East Africa in the early seventies.

[[Wilson Kinyonga]] and [[George Kinyonga]] joined the band in 1966 and played with it for the next four years before leaving in December 1970 to found [[Arusha Jazz Band]] and later [[Simba Wanyika]], one of the most influential music groups in East Africa. Jamhuri Jazz Band started as Young Nyamwezi Jazz Band and was financed and managed by Joseph Bagabuje and recruited John Kijiko. Bagabuje was the first Tanganyikan to run Amani Tea Estate.It is important to the readers to know that, before independence of Tanganyika (1961) the Band used to play jazz music at Tanga hotel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1400">The '''Jihu''' were a people who lived along the [[Yellow River]] in northern [[Guannei]] and [[Hedong Commandery|Hedong]] during the 7th century AD. According to Jonathan Karam Skaff, the Jihu had facial features distinct from the local [[Chinese people]] and were described as having "Barbarian heads and Han tongues."{{sfn|Skaff|2012|p=63}} The majority of Jihu retained their native tongue and with the exception of their chiefs, none spoke [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. The men dressed similarly to the Han and practiced similar martial ethos while the women wore shell jewelry and were known to have sexual relations before marriage. They produced a special type of linen known as "barbarian female linen" or "Ji female linen". The Jihu worshiped a local Jihu [[Buddhist]] saint and constructed earthen pagodas with cypress flagpoles decorated with silkworm cocoons.{{sfn|Skaff|2012|p=63}} The Jihu participated in raids against the [[Tang dynasty]] along with the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] in the early 620s but eventually submitted to the Tang in 626.{{sfn|Skaff|2012|p=64 }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65056">The [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) has designated 82 [[World Heritage site]]s in 18 countries (also called "[[Sovereign state|state parties]]") of [[Western Asia]]: [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Cyprus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Oman]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Qatar]] and [[Yemen]]. While [[Egypt]] is partially in Western Asia, its World Heritage sites are listed under [[List of World Heritage sites in Africa|Africa]] instead. One site is located in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref group="nb" name="jerusalem"&gt;Site proposed by [[Jordan]]. UNESCO has stated that "In line with relevant UN resolutions, [[East Jerusalem]] remains part of the occupied Palestinian territory, and the status of Jerusalem must be resolved in permanent status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kuwait]] is the only country in the region that does not have any World Heritage sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Number of World Heritage Properties by region |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat#s1 |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN division"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#europe|title= Composition of macro geographical (continental) regions, geographical sub-regions, and selected economic and other groupings|year= 2010|work= Geographical region and composition of each region|publisher= [[United Nations Statistics Division]]|accessdate= 20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabian Oryx Sanctuary]] was designated as a World Heritage site of Oman in 1994 but was [[Former UNESCO World Heritage sites|delisted]] in 2007. As the protected area was reduced by 90% as a result of Oman's decision, UNESCO delisted the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/654 Arabian Oryx Sanctuary], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

In this region, [[Iran]] is home to the most inscribed sites with 23 sites.&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list |title=World Heritage List |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sites to be recognized by UNESCO from the region were [[Persepolis]], [[Meidan Emam, Esfahan]], [[Tchogha Zanbil]] (Iran) and the [[Ancient City of Damascus]] (Syria).&lt;ref name="SitebyYear"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;action=stat&amp;mode=table#s4 |title=Number of World Heritage properties inscribed each Year |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, UNESCO's [[World Heritage Committee]] may inscribe new sites on the list, or delist sites that no longer meet the criteria. Selection is based on [[World Heritage site#Selection criteria|ten criteria]]: six for [[cultural heritage]] (i&amp;ndash;vi) and four for [[natural heritage]] (vii&amp;ndash;x).&lt;ref name="criteria"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Criteria for Selection |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sites, designated "mixed sites," represent both cultural and natural heritage. In Western Asia, there are 67 cultural, 1 natural, and 3 mixed sites.&lt;ref name="noms"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/nominations/ |title=World Heritage List Nominations |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage Committee may also specify that a site is [[World Heritage in Danger|endangered]], citing "conditions which threaten the very characteristics for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List." Seven sites in this region are currently listed as endangered; one site ([[Bahla Fort]]) had been listed previously, and possible danger listing has been considered by UNESCO in a number of other cases.&lt;ref name="dangerlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/ |title=World Heritage in Danger |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
The table is sortable by column by clicking on the [[File:Sort both.gif]] at the top of the appropriate column; alphanumerically for the site, area, and year columns; by state party for the location column; and by criteria type for the criteria column. Transborder sites sort at the bottom.

{{GeoGroupTemplate}}
:'''Site'''; named after the World Heritage Committee's official designation&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;
:'''Location'''; at city, regional, or provincial level and geocoordinates
:'''Criteria'''; as defined by the World Heritage Committee&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;
:'''Area'''; in [[hectare]]s and [[acre]]s. If available, the size of the buffer zone has been noted as well. A value of zero implies that no data has been published by UNESCO
:'''Year'''; during which the site was inscribed to the World Heritage List
:'''Description'''; brief information about the site, including reasons for qualifying as an endangered site, if applicable

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1017">'''Luotes''' are magic words of Finnish [[Kalevala meter]]ic [[incantation]]. Possibly luotes have been needed only for the most powerful spells, in which case they have denoted especially [[holy]] words. Different incantations have been distinct luotes, which have been must a command of to be able to the incantation.

Finnish-language word "luote" contains possibly a verb trust, in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] "luottaa", that have evidently referred to it, that the words have been trusted or given up only from a seer for a close relative for a student or from a dead or a spirit for a seer. ("Give up" is in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] "luovuttaa", which is a cognate word to the above-mentioned Finnish-language word "luottaa", in [[English language|English]] "to trust".)

Missing luotes have been must fetch in folk stories including from [[Tuonela]], [[Louhi]] or buried [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] [[Antero Vipunen]].

The '''National Unity Party''' ({{lang-pt|Partido da Unidade Nacional}}, PUN) was a [[political party]] in [[Guinea-Bissau]].

==History==
The party was established by [[Idrissa Djaló]] on 26 July 2001.&lt;ref name=PP&gt;Bogdan Szajkowski (2005) ''Political Parties of the World'', p273&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2004|2004 parliamentary elections]] the party received 1.46% of the vote and failed to win a seat.&lt;ref name=PP/&gt; In the [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential election]] Djaló finished eighth with 0.8% of the vote.

The party boycotted the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2008|2008 parliamentary elections]], with Djaló claiming that "the ballot will not resolve any of the persistent great problems in the country".&lt;ref name=HD&gt;Peter Karibe Mendy (2013) ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau'', Scarecrow Press, p328&lt;/ref&gt; It did not contest presidential elections in [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2009|2009]] or [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2012|2012]], but supported the [[2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'état|2012 military coup]].&lt;ref name=HD/&gt;

[[Radio-Television Slovenia]] is the owner of the Radio.

== History ==
Radio Koper was first heard on 24 May 1949, called '' Radio jugoslovanske cone Trsta - Radio Trieste zona Jugoslava'' (Radio Triest, Yugoslav Zone), and it started to broadcast a day later. It was owned by D. D. Radiofonia SA, set up by the then Yugoslav military administration Zone B of the former [[Free Territory of Trieste]]. After the abolition of the Free Territory in 1954, it teamed up with Radio Ljubljana and was later known as ''Radio Koper - Capodistria''. Until 1954, it broadcast programs in [[Slovene language|Slovenian]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. From 1954 to 1979, the program was mainly in Italian, while two short blocks were reserved to Slovenian in the morning and evening time. In 1979, the two linguistic versions of the radio separated, each with its own transmitter network. Studio [[Nova Gorica]]] became operational in 1980, and in 1992 Radio Koper expanded into the Slovenian holding as an all-day radio broadcast. 

Radio Koper - Capodistria as a border and minority radio station played a very important role in the history of this area  in bringing together neighboring nations, especially during the Cold War. For many years Radio Capodistria was one of the three most listened radio stations in Italy, its signal is stretched even to the shores of Africa, carrying Socialist and Titoist cross-border propaganda particularly appreciated by the members and sympathizers of the [[Italian Communist Party]], particularly its youth. After the independence of Slovenia, Radio Koper became an organizational unit of [[RTV Slovenia]], which has eliminated the transmission system in Italy, while the cross-border program shifted to minority and regional.

== Programming and rating ==

Radio Koper is the most listened radio station in the [[Slovenian Littoral]] and on both sides of the Slovenian-Italian border. Many listeners also come from [[Croatian Istria]]. In 2011 it was among the ten most listened radio stations in Slovenia (official data radiometry carried out by the agency Mediapool).

Radio Koper created a program that combines the informational, cultural, educational, children's, music, entertainment and sports programs. Its own program begins at 5:00 and ends at 24:00. During this time, the radio plays three regional news programs, five reports and a lot of voice and music broadcasts. During the night it broadcasts the night program of [[Radio Slovenija 1]], which it also prepares every Friday from the studios of Koper and Nova Gorica.
In addition to regular programs, which are being prepared for all three programs, the contributions daily presence in news programming.

Radio Koper is distinguished by its rich musical productions and is also establishing itself as a promoter of cultural and social events throughout the coastal region, including that in Italy, where Slovenians live.

== Infrastructures ==

The Hendrix Studio of Radio Koper is designed for the recording and production of classical, choral and pop music. It is used for the most demanding technical music radio shows, roundtables and confrontation. It is a technologically modern music production studio, which for many years has been famous for its excellent acoustic characteristics such as the recording control box.

Radio Koper's ''Fonoteka'' keeps the archives of music and recordings from the beginning of broadcasting of the Slovenian and Italian program on different media. On the shelves is also has over 25,000 strips, 44,000 LPs, CDs 22100, 2000 CD-house production - recorded in the studio Hendrix and beyond 1100 DAT tapes. At present, the entire archive is in the process of digitization.

Radio Koper also has a contemporary reportage truck RA 3, equipped with the most modern digital technology, which allows the sound recordings of musical events and transfers of technology-intensive events at external locations.

The phrase "Supreme Leader", as ''Oberste Führer'', was used by [[Adolf Hitler]] in his role respectively as supreme commander of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) and the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS).

'''"The First Day of Love"''' ({{lang-no|"Den første dagen av kjærlighet"|italic=no}}) was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974]], performed in [[English language|English]] by [[Anne-Karine Strøm]]. This was the first occasion on which the Norwegian entry had not featured any lyrics in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]].

The song is an inspirational number, with Anne Karine singing about the regenerative power of love. She sings that everyone in the world wants the same thing, love, and that by moving towards that goal the human race is becoming closer.

The song was performed fourth on the night, following [[Spain]]'s [[Peret]] with "[[Canta y sé feliz]]" and preceding [[Greece]]'s [[Marinella]] with "[[Krasi, Thalasa Ke T' Agori Mu]]". At the close of voting, it had received just 3 points and perhaps unjustly, the song came last, placing joint 14th in a field of 17.

In the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976 contest]], Anne Karine Strøm would represent Norway for the third and final time with the disco oriented song "[[Mata Hari (song)|Mata Hari]]", she would finish with 7 points, and 18th out of 18 entrants, thus awarding Strøm the unique accolade of being the only performer in history of the Eurovision Song Contest, to have finished in last place more than once, a record she still holds as of 2012.

Anne was succeeded as [[Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest|Norwegian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975 contest]] by fellow Bendik Singer [[Ellen Nikolaysen]] with "[[Touch My Life (With Summer)]]".

[[File:Visite du Branchage Juilet 2008 Saint Hélyi a.jpg|thumb|Measuring overhanging greenery with a pole of standard length]]

A '''Visite du Branchage''' is an inspection of roads in [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]] to ensure property owners have complied with the laws against vegetation encroaching onto the road.

==Jersey==

The Visite du Branchage takes place in each [[Parishes of Jersey|Parish]] twice a year to check that occupiers of houses and land bordering on public [[road]]s have undertaken the 'branchage'.
 
The ''Loi (1914) sur la Voirie'' imposes a duty on all occupiers of property to ensure that encroachments are removed from the public highway.

The first Visite is between 1–15 July and the second is between 1–15 September.

On the Visite du Branchage the [[Connétable (Jersey and Guernsey)|Connétable]], assisted by the members of the [[Roads Committee]], [[Roads Inspector]]s and the [[Centenier]]s, will visit the roads of his parish accompanied by the [[Vingtenier]]s in their respective [[Vingtaine]]s to ensure that the branchage has been completed. Occupiers of land may be fined up to £50 for each infraction unless - 
*the 'branchage' [hedges, branches and overhanging trees] has been trimmed back so as to give a clearance of 12 feet over main roads and by-roads;
*the 'branchage' [hedges, branches and overhanging trees] has been trimmed back so as to give a clearance of 8 feet over [[Sidewalk|footpath]]s; and all trimmings have been removed from the road.

If the branchage has not been completed the occupier will be required to undertake the work and, if it is not carried out, the Parish may arrange for the work to be done and charge the occupier the cost of that work. 

The Visite du Branchage applies to all public roads including main roads, by-roads and footpaths. 

The [[Branchage]] Film Festival, takes its name from Visite du Branchage.

'''WJTP''' is an [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[radio station]] broadcasting on a frequency of 890 [[kHz]] with 5,000 [[watt]]s of power during daytime hours only. The [[radio station|station]] is licensed to [[Lithia Springs, Georgia]], a suburb of [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Atlanta]].  Its signal is transmitted from a facility closer to the city of [[Atlanta, Georgia]] as it shares the broadcast towers of [[WAOK (AM)|WAOK]] AM 1380 near the western interchange of [[Interstate 20 in Georgia|Interstate 20]] and [[Interstate 285 (Georgia)|Interstate 285]].  The station is currently owned by James Su.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=WJTP |title=WJTP Facility Record |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because WJTP shares the same frequency as "[[clear-channel station|clear channel]]" station [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] AM 890 in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], this station only broadcasts during the [[daytime (astronomy)|daytime]] hours.

==History==
===Origins===
'''WJTP''' was established on April 15, 1959, as '''WGOG''', broadcasting from [[Walhalla, South Carolina]] at 1460&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=53168 |title=History cards of WJTP}}&lt;/ref&gt; WGOG was owned by Oconee Broadcasting. On June 16, 1965, WGOG switched its frequency to 1000&amp;nbsp;kHz (a frequency used for clear  channel radio). In 1984, Oconee Broadcasting sold WGOG to Luzanne Griffith, who was the station's Traffic Manager and Receptionist. Ms. Griffith would establish WGOG-FM in 1991.

On April 1, 2002, WGOG was sold to Georgia-Carolina Radiocasting, changing its callsign to '''WSSW'''. On April 18, 2002, the station changed its call sign to '''WSMW'''. Then, on September 25, 2003, it changed to '''WWOF'''.

===Move to Atlanta===
On June 26, 2008, Tugart Properties, LLC sold WWOF to New Life Broadcasting and was cleared to move into the [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Atlanta market area]] on its new frequency 890 [[kHz]]. On October 10, 2008, WWOF changed to the current WJTP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=2464&amp;Callsign=WJTP |title=WJTP Call Sign History |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}&lt;/ref&gt; The station began broadcasting from its new facility in [[Lithia Springs, Georgia]] on January 25, 2009, with a Spanish Christian format.

In January 2011, the station began simulcasting China Radio International, broadcasting general news and entertainment in English and Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese), targeting Chinese-Americans in the Atlanta area. Programs from CRI are distributed by AIM Broadcasting (American International Media) in Palo Alto, California. China Radio International also airs over [[KGBC]] 1540 AM in the [[Houston, Texas]] area.

On June 30, 2012, the station's license was transferred from New Life Broadcasting to National Broadcasting, Inc. The two companies share common ownership. In October 2013, WJTP was sold to James Su's Major Radio, LLC for $2.1 million. The sale was consummated on December 23, 2013.

[[File:Weimar Triangle.png|thumb|350px|Political map of the "Weimar Triangle"]]
The '''"Weimar Triangle"''' is, loosely, a grouping of [[Poland]], [[Germany]], and [[France]]. The group is intended to promote co-operation between the three countries in crisis zones.&lt;ref name="eubusiness"/&gt; It exists mostly in the form of [[Summit (meeting)|summit meetings]] between the leaders of these three countries, the most recent of which occurred on 7 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.pl/business/?id=148874 "Leaders in Warsaw can’t cover up EU budget rift"] Thenews.pl, News from Poland. Retrieved 7 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Previous meetings took place in [[Poznań]], Poland (1998), [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France (1999), [[Hambach, Germany|Hambach]], Germany (2001) and Nancy, France (2005). The Weimar Triangle also involves lower-level connections, such as the annual meeting between [[Foreign minister|Foreign Ministers]].

The most recent leaders' summit was hosted by President [[Bronisław Komorowski]] of Poland and attended by President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] (France) and Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] (Germany). Issues of renewing regular Weimar Triangle meetings, the Egyptian situation and improving relations with Russia were discussed (Among other topics). Both Germany and France urged Poland to join the pact for competitiveness.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== History ==
[[File:Weimar Battlegroup.jpg|thumb|200px|Emblem of the [[Weimar Battlegroup]].]]
The Weimar Triangle was established in the German city of [[Weimar]] in 1991, aimed at assisting Poland's emergence from [[Communism|Communist]] rule. Attending the meeting were the Foreign Ministers of each state: [[Roland Dumas]] of France, [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] of Germany, and [[Krzysztof Skubiszewski]] of Poland.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Genscher chose Weimar for the inaugural meeting because it was situated in former East Germany.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;Sarah Helm (May 23, 1996), [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/weimar-triangle-takes-shape-for-power-1348723.html 'Weimar Triangle' takes shape for power] ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1992 meeting of the Weimar Triangle in France, Poland won agreement from Germany and France that it should have special association status at the [[Western European Union]], the European arm of [[NATO]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

On 5 July 2011, Poland, France, and Germany signed an agreement in Brussels to put together a unit of 1,700 soldiers, called the [[Weimar Battlegroup]], that will be ready to deploy in crisis zones starting in 2013. The EU business newsletter reports that Poland will command the group, providing the core combat troops and a mechanised battalion, Germany will provide logistical support, and France will contribute medical support. The operational command centre will be based in Mont Valerien, located in a Paris suburb.&lt;ref name="eubusiness"&gt;AFP, [http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/military-france.b52  Germany, France and Poland form EU battlegroup] EUbusiness. Retrieved 5 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|referendum]] on the status of [[Crimea]] held on March 16, 2014, the chairpersons of the Weimar Triangle parliaments's committees on foreign affairs – [[Elisabeth Guigou]] of [[France]], [[Norbert Röttgen]] of [[Germany]] and [[Grzegorz Schetyna]] of [[Poland]] – visited Kyiv to express their countries’ firm support of the territorial integrity and the European integration of [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mfa.gov.ua/en/press-center/news/21506-krajini-vejmarsykogo-trikutnika-pidtrimujuty-teritorialynu-cilisnisty-ta-jevrointegracijnij-postup-ukrajini Weimar Triangle countries support the territorial integrity and European integration of Ukraine] [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine]], press release of April 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time that parliamentarians of the Weimar Triangle had ever made a joint trip to a third country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bundestag.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2014/pm_1404081/263198 Parlamentarier des Weimarer Dreiecks: Röttgen, Guigou und Schetyna in Kiew] [[Bundestag]], press release of April 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Poland's foreign minister [[Witold Waszczykowski]] told daily newspaper ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'' that the Weimar Triangle had lost its relevance for his country.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Szczerbaniewicz (April 6, 2016), [http://www.heute.de/polen-haelt-weimarer-dreieck-mit-deutschland-und-frankreich-fuer-erschoepft-42988830.html "Weimarer Dreieck" beendet: Polens Abkehr vom alten Europa] ''[[ZDF]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2016, representatives of the three countries vowed to "reinvigorate" the Weimar Triangle. German foreign minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] said the group would meet before the end of 2016, and French foreign minister [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] said France would host a summit in November 2016. The stated reasoning for this reinvigoration were the [[Brexit|decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union]], as well as the ongoing [[European migrant crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shalal|first1=Andrea|title=Germany, Poland and France revive Weimar group to bolster EU confidence|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-britain-germany-weimar-idUSKCN1130S7|website=Reuters|accessdate=28 August 2016|location=Weimar, Germany|language=English|date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
