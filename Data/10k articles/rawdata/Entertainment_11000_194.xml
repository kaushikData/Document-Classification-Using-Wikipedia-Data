'''''2Dark''''' is a stealth adventure horror game directed by [[Frédérick Raynal]].

==Plot==
A former detective named Mr. Smith travels to the town of Gloomywood to solve a mystery involving disappearing children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=|first=|date= |url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/435100/ |title=2Dark Steam Listing |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Gameplay is intended to be simplistic and accessible to casual gamers. The player can pick up items by walking into them. Stealth will play a large role in the gameplay, and the player can use darkness to hide their location. Enemies can be alerted by sounds that the player makes. The player will need to rescue children, who will move slowly and be susceptible to danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kerry-Lee |first=Copsey |date=February 17, 2017 |url=https://www.gamereactor.eu/previews/503913/2Dark/ |title= 2Dark Preview |publisher=Gamereactor |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''2Dark'' was funded on Ulule on November 21, 2014.

On October 26, 2015, a trailer of ''2Dark'' was published. It was confirmed that the game was being developed by a new French studio called Gloomywood, which initially consisted of four people, with [[Frédérick Raynal]] directing. The beta was made available to buy for €20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |date=October 26, 2015 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-10-26-alone-in-the-dark-creator-announces-stealth-horror-game-2dark |title=Alone in the Dark creator announces stealth horror game 2Dark |website=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2016, Gloomywood confirmed that ''2Dark'' would be released on consoles in addition to PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gelmini |first=David |date=March 16, 2016|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/155870/upcoming-game-2dark-alone-dark-creator-frederick-raynal-confirmed-consoles/ |title=2Dark from Alone in the Dark Creator Frédérick Raynal Confirmed for Consoles |website=[[Dread Central]] |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''2Dark'''s release, people saw that the game was protected with the [[Digital rights management|DRM]] [[Denuvo]]. During the Ulule campaign, Gloomywood promised that the game was going to be DRM free.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ulule.com/2dark/&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this means that Linux and Mac versions that were planned will never be released. As of April 19, 2017, six days after having been cracked by [[List of warez groups#CPY|CPY]], Denuvo has been removed from 2Dark.

==Reception==
''2Dark'' garnered mixed reviews, and holds an average of 56/100 on aggregate web site [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2Dark for PlayStation 4 Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/2dark|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PlayStation Universe]] awarded it a score of 4.0 out of 10, saying "The setup for ''2Dark'' holds intrigue, with a grim plot, and suitably creepy settings, but so much of how it actually plays out quickly diminishes the horror aspect of it. Respectable enough as a game, a failure as a horror."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bolt |first=Neil |date=March 10, 2017 |url=http://www.psu.com/review/32437/2DARK-Review---PS4 |title=2Dark Review |publisher= [[PlayStation Universe]] |accessdate=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''album era''' was a period in English-language popular music from the mid 1960s to the mid 2000s in which the [[album]] was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption.  It was primarily driven by three successive music recording formats, the 33{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;rpm [[LP record]], the [[Compact Cassette|audiocassette]] and the music [[Compact disc]].

==Origins==
Technological developments in the early twentieth century led to the development of the vinyl [[LP album|long-playing (LP) album]] as an important medium for recorded music. In 1948, [[Columbia Records]] began to bring out 33{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;rpm twelve-inch extended-play LPs that could play for as long as 52 minutes, or 26 minutes per side. [[Musical film]] soundtracks, jazz works, and thematic albums by singers such as [[Frank Sinatra]] quickly utilized the new longer format. However, in the 1950s and into the 1960s, 45&amp;nbsp;rpm [[seven-inch single]] sales were considered the primary market for the recorded music industry, while albums were a secondary market.  The careers of notable rock and roll performers such as [[Elvis Presley]] were driven primarily by single sales.

==1960s–1990s==
The dominance of the single as the primary medium of creative expression in music changed with the release of several albums in the 1960s, such as ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector]]'' (1963), [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965),&lt;ref name="MartinProg p 41" /&gt; [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966), [[the Mothers of Invention]]'s ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966), and the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Julien|first=Oliver|title=Sgt. Pepper and the Beatles: It Was Forty Years Ago Today|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2013|isbn=9781409493822}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the Beatles' ''Rubber Soul'', ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''Sgt. Pepper'' and the Beach Boys' ''Pet Sounds'', writer [[Bill Martin (philosophy)|Bill Martin]] noted: "In the wake of these albums, many rock musicians took up the 'complete album approach.'"&lt;ref name="MartinProg p 41"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Bill|title=Listening to the Future: The Time of Progressive Rock, 1968-1978|date=1998|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago, Ill. [u.a.]|isbn=0-8126-9368-X|pages=41|edition=1. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' assistant editor Andy Greene felt that ''Sgt. Pepper's'' "was the beginning of the album era.  It was the big bang of albums."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Kokenes. [http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/29/lennon.lyrics.auction/ "'A Day in the Life' Lyrics to be Auctioned."] [[CNN.com]]. 30 April 2010. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Howard, writing in his book ''Sonic Alchemy'', "pop's stakes had been raised into the stratosphere" by the Beatles' ''Rubber Soul'', resulting in a shift in focus from singles to creating albums without the usual [[filler (media)|filler]] tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Howard |first=David N. |year=2004 |title=Sonic Alchemy: Visionary Music Producers and Their Maverick Recordings |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4Sk0FNXkjcC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=rubber+soul+album+without+filler#v=onepage&amp;q=rubber%20soul%20album%20without%20filler&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-634-05560-7 |p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1966, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine cited the initial US sales of ''Rubber Soul'' (1.2 million copies over nine days) as evidence of teenage record-buyers increasingly moving towards the LP format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q="Rubber+Soul"+%22nine+days%22 |author=Staff writer|title=Teen Market Is Album Market|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=18 March 2016|p=36|date=15 January 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, no singles were released from the album, which writer [[David Leaf]] says created the "perception that their new work should be viewed as a whole.&amp;nbsp;... it introduced the possibility to the recording industry that the 45&amp;nbsp;RPM disc&amp;nbsp;... preeminent for a decade&amp;nbsp;... might soon give way to a new king&amp;nbsp;... the album as a work of art."&lt;ref name="LeafPerspective"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |first=David |last=Leaf |authorlink=David Leaf |chapter=''Pet Sounds'' – Perspective |title=The Pet Sounds Sessions |others=[[The Beach Boys]] |year=1997 |publisher=[[Capitol Records]] |type=Booklet|chapter-url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Pet_Sounds_-_Perspective.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During ''Pet Sounds''' composition and production, Beach Boys bandleader [[Brian Wilson]] found the American version of ''Rubber Soul'' to be "a collection of songs that…somehow went together like no album ever made before", which inspired Wilson to briefly shift his focus from singles to albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Stevens | first =Robert  | url =http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/oct2007/wils-o24.shtml  | title = An Evening with Brian Wilson: The Palace Theatre in Manchester, England—September&amp;nbsp;23, 2007 | publisher =wsws.org | date=October 24, 2007 | accessdate = March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mid 1960s to the late 1970s was the era of the LP and the "golden era" of the album. According to BBC Four's ''The Golden Age'', "These were the years when the music industry exploded to become bigger than Hollywood."&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01qhn70 Synopsis of "When Albums Ruled the World."] from [[BBC Four]]'s ''The Golden Age Of The Album'' series. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  This period, especially the 1970s, is also called the Album Rock Era. Music critic [[Dave Marsh]] has called [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s 1967 "[[Purple Haze]]" the "debut single of the Album Rock Era"&lt;ref&gt;Dave Marsh. Review of "Purple Haze" in ''The Heart of Rock &amp; Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made.'' Dave Marsh. Da Capo Press, 1999. p. 178. {{ISBN|9780306809019}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called [[Lou Gramm]]'s 1987 "[[Midnight Blue (Lou Gramm song)|Midnight Blue]]" the "last great single of the album-rock era".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Thomas Erlewine. Review of ''Jukebox Heroes: The Foreigner Anthology'' in ''All Music Guide Required Listening: Classic Rock.'' Chris Woodstra, John Bush and Stephen Thomas Erlewine, eds. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2007. p. 72. {{ISBN|9780879309176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[LP record]], the [[8-track tape]] was another format popular in the United States in this period. After the fall of LP record sales at the end of the 1970s and rise of first the cassette and then the CD as the dominant format for recorded music saw the end of the LP-driven "golden age" of the album, the album consolidated its domination of the recorded music market.  Seven-inch vinyl single sales were dropping and were almost totally displaced by [[cassette single]]s by the end of the 1980s.  Yet these were never as popular as seven-inch singles and they and the subsequent CD singles never amounted to a significant threat to the dominance of the album.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The primary threat to the album's primacy in the 1980s and early 1990s came from [[MTV]].  It was quickly recognized that, "after the album-rock era of the 1970s, MTV helped return the hit single to prominence as a pop marketing tool".&lt;ref name=Pareles&gt;Jon Pareles.

"Death of the album" is a phrase used to describe the perceived decline of album sales in the 21st century, sometimes attributed to internet sharing and downloading,&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation|last=Baneriee|first=Scott|title=New Ideas, New Outlets|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=6 November 2004|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRMEAAAAMBAJ|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kiss|first=Jemima|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2008/aug/29/thedeathofthealbum|work=[[Guardian.co.uk]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=29 August 2008|title=The death of the album|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the changing expectations of music listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Paxson|first=Peyton|date=2010|title=Mass Communications and Media Studies: An Introduction|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=9781441108951|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RusUVdLjxrsC|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Album sales more than halved from 1999 to 2009, declining from a $14.6 to $6.3 billion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Album Sales Are Down|url=http://www.speeli.com/articles/view/Why-album-sales-are-down|website=Speeli|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to releasing an album, some bands have begun releasing a series of singles&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hopkins|first=Daniel|title=Advice to Every New Band: Stop Putting Out Albums|work=[[Dallas Observer]]|date=12 September 2012|publisher=Kevin Thornburg|url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2012/09/ask_a_failed_musician.php|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Extended play|EP]]s as a way to combat the "average person's short attention span."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Hearsay|title=Death of the Album?|work=[[Fort Worth Weekly]]|date=3 October 2012|url=http://www.fwweekly.com/2012/10/03/death-album/|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 1990s, single song delivery of music to the consumer was almost dead, at least in the United States.&lt;ref name=Leeds/&gt;  In 1998, ''Billboard'' magazine [[Billboard Hot 100#Album cuts|ended the requirement of a physical single]] for charting on its [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart after several of the year's major hits were not released as singles. But, despite the dominance of the CD, technological changes quickly turned the tables. In 1999, the internet [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] service [[Napster]] allowed internet users to easily download single songs in [[MP3]] format.  By early 2001, Napster use peaked with 26.4 million users worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Jupiter Media Metrix (July 20, 2001). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080413104420/http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?id=249 Global Napster Usage Plummets, But New File-Sharing Alternatives Gaining Ground]. Press Release.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Napster was shut down in 2001 for copyright violations, other [[music download]] services took its place.  In 2001, [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iTunes]] service was introduced and the [[iPod]], a consumer-friendly MP3 player, was released later that year.  This and other legal alternatives as well as illicit file sharing continued to depress sales of recorded music on physical formats.  By 2006, downloaded digital single sales outnumbered CD sales for the first time and buyers of digital music purchased singles over albums by a margin of 19:1.&lt;ref name=Leeds&gt;Jeff Leeds. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/26/business/media/26music.html "The Album, a Commodity in Disfavor."] ''[[The New York Times]]''. 26 March 2007. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even music industry executives were forced to admit that the album was on its way out.  "For some genres and some artists, having an album-centric plan will be a thing of the past," [[Capitol-EMI]]'s COO Jeff Kempler said.  Other warnings were more dire.  Media researcher Aram Sinnreich bluntly predicted that "the album is going to die.  Consumers are listening to play lists" on their MP3 players.&lt;ref name=Leeds/&gt;

With consumers abandoning albums, performers "started concentrating on dishing out singles as opposed to churning out albums".&lt;ref name=Morey&gt;Tejas Morey. [http://www.mensxp.com/technology/internet/8798-how-itunes-changed-the-music-industry-forever.html "How iTunes Changed The Music Industry Forever."] ''MensXP ([[Times of India]])''.

'''Best-Lock Construction Toys''' is a brand of [[plastic]] building bricks that are compatible with [[Lego]]. Best-Lock Group Limited, which manufacture the bricks, is based in [[Colne]], [[Lancashire]], England.

==History==
Best-Lock was founded in 1997 by Torsten Geller after he looked into the legalities of [[Mega Blok]] and other [[Lego clones]], which led him to look into Lego's past to find that Lego had copied their bricks from a British psychologist and inventor Hilary Page in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="hc"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Mara |title=Blocking And Tackling: A Nasty LEGO Copyright Battle |url=http://articles.courant.com/2012-01-29/business/hc-lego-patent-fight-20120129_1_lego-men-lego-toys-lock |accessdate=8 October 2018 |work=Hartford Courant |date=29 January 2012 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hfb&gt;{{cite news |last1=Seay |first1=Gregory |title=Lego locked in domestic copyright fight |url=http://www.hartfordbusiness.com/article/20120130/PRINTEDITION/301309998/lego-locked-in-domestic-copyright-fight |accessdate=8 October 2018 |work=Hartford Business Journal |date=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Best-Lock has been involved with multiple legal cases involving Lego. The company moved in 1998 against Lego's exclusivity claims to toy-block design. Best-Lock won the case in court thus allowing them to sell sets in Germany.&lt;ref name=hfb/&gt; They defeated a patent challenge from Lego in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13691552.html |title=Forty-year Monopolistic LEGO-Doctrine Ruling Reversed as Best-Lock Europe LTD Wins Patent and Trademark Case |publisher=Highbeam |date=28 March 2005 |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=en&amp;Datum=Aktuell&amp;nr=32168&amp;linked=pm |title=Pressemitteilung Nr. 147/04 vom 3.12.2004 |publisher=Juris.bundesgerichtshof.de |date= |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a further case in 2009, Lego was denied trademark protection for the shape of its bricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=von RA Dennis Breuer |url=http://www.markenmagazin.de/pressemitteilung-des-bgh-nr-1582009-legostein-als-marke-geloescht/ |title=Pressemitteilung des BGH Nr. 158/2009: Legostein als Marke gelöscht &amp;#124; markenmagazin:recht |publisher=Markenmagazin.de |date=19 April 2012 |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Best-Lock and [[Cobi (building blocks)|Cobi]], a Polish building block manufacturer with a strong presence in Eastern Europe and Asia, announced a merger on 2 February 2006, in which Best-Lock purchase a part of Cobi. Plans called for Best-Lock to shift manufacturing to Cobi while Cobi expanded its manufacturing facilities. The merger has since yielded co-branded building block toys. Toys are still sold under the separate labels Best-Lock and Cobi, but many Cobi sets appear in North American retailers such as [[Toys R' Us]] and [[Amazon.com]] under the Best-Lock brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060202005092/en/Lock-Group-Ltd.-Pleased-Announce-Merger-COBI|title=Best Lock Group Ltd. Is Pleased to Announce Its Merger with Cobi|website=Business Wire|date=7 February 2006|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Lego filed a three-dimensional trademark for its mini-figures, which Best Lock had duplicated since 1998. Thus in 2012, Best-Lock sued to get the trademark revoked. On 16 June 2015, European Court of Justice upheld Lego's figure trademark.&lt;ref name="gdn"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Butler |first1=Sarah |title=Lego blocks legal bid to remove trademark protection for its mini-figures |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/lego-trademark-protection-mini-figures-european-court-justice-best-lock |accessdate=8 October 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=16 June 2015 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/11678285/EU-court-rules-Lego-figurines-are-protected-trademark.html |title=EU court rules Lego figurines are protected trademark |date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

Themes for standard blocks include town sets (police, fire and construction), military, pirates, farming, and Kimmy (Best-Lock sets made for females).

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2007}}

A '''cast recording''' is a recording of a stage [[Musical theatre|musical]] that is intended to document the songs as they were performed in the show and experienced by the audience. An '''original cast recording''' or OCR, as the name implies, features the voices of the show's original cast. A cast recording featuring the first cast to perform a musical in a particular venue is known, for example, as an "original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] cast recording" or an "original [[West End theatre|London]] cast recording".

Cast recordings are (usually) studio recordings rather than live recordings. The recorded song lyrics and orchestrations are nonetheless identical (or very similar to) those of the songs as performed in the theatre. Like any studio performance, the recording is an idealized rendering, more glossily perfect than any live performance could be, and without audible audience reaction. Nevertheless, the listener who has attended the live show expects it to be an accurate souvenir of the experience.

==History==
The British were the first to make cast recordings, and they were also the first to make original [[London]] cast recordings of shows that had already opened on Broadway, but had not been recorded with their original Broadway cast. This led to the odd situation of having, for example, a 1928 recording of the London cast of ''[[Show Boat]]'', but no recording with the actual 1927 Broadway cast, and a recording of the London cast of [[Sigmund Romberg]]'s ''[[The Desert Song]]'', but not of the 1926 Broadway cast - even though both of these shows are Broadway musicals, rather than British ones.

Prior to the development of original cast recordings, there had been recordings of songs from musicals, and collections of several such songs, and recordings of songs performed by cast members; but they were recordings of ''songs'', that is, they were recorded as stand-alone [[show tune]]s rather than representations of a (more or less) complete musical.

The first [[United States|American]] original cast recording as we know it was an early experimental [[long playing|LP]] of program transcriptions of selections from ''[[The Band Wagon]]'', a 1931 revue starring [[Fred Astaire|Fred]] and [[Adele Astaire]]. It was not widely released.

The following year, [[Jack Kapp]] produced an album of songs from ''[[Show Boat]]'' timed to the 1932 Ziegfeld revival. This album featured [[Helen Morgan]] and [[Paul Robeson]] doing their songs from the show but used studio cast singers for the leads.

As the 1930s progressed, Liberty Music Shop in [[New York City]] made mini albums of songs from the [[Ethel Merman]] musical comedies ''[[Red Hot and Blue]]'' and ''[[Stars in Your Eyes]]''. These were more like personality recordings, since the arrangements were not the ones heard in the theatre.

The first complete so-called original cast album was [[Marc Blitzstein]]'s 1938 album of songs from ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'' although these were recorded with just piano accompaniment and not the show's orchestra. In 1984, the original recordings from ''[[Very Warm for May]]'' (1939) were discovered and issued on an LP. However, these recordings were not made with the original orchestrations.

RCA Victor had made an album of the key songs from ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' using the theatre orchestra but featuring Met opera singers [[Lawrence Tibbett]] and [[Helen Jepson]] singing the songs. [[Decca Records|Decca]] riposted with another album of the same highlights sung by the actual stars of the original production, although recorded five years after the premiere. When a revival was staged in 1942, Decca issued a second album of some of the secondary songs from the opera by the revival cast and later combined these two albums onto one LP and called it the "original cast recording". Decca also issued an album of songs from the all-soldier revue ''[[This Is the Army]]'' by [[Irving Berlin]].

Finally in 1943, came Decca's recording of ''[[Oklahoma!]]''. It not only featured the original cast, but the show's original chorus, all accompanied by the same orchestra heard in the show, playing the music in the original [[Robert Russell Bennett]] orchestrations and conducted by the show's original conductor, [[Jay Blackton]]. The show was the biggest hit Broadway had experienced up until that time and people who could not get tickets bought the album. It would eventually sell over 1 million copies as a set of 78-rpm records, and millions more on LP and Compact Discs.

Decca soon began recording every hit musical that came along including ''[[Carmen Jones]]'', ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', and ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''. Soon, all the other record companies were bidding for the rights to record Broadway shows with their original casts.

[[Capitol Records|Capitol]] recorded ''[[St. Louis Woman]]'' in 1946, and [[RCA Victor Records|RCA Victor]] recorded ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'' in 1947. Although Decca abandoned the cast album field in the mid-1950s, Capitol and Victor actively bid for recording rights. Sometimes problems arose as when RCA Victor signed on to record the 1950 musical ''[[Call Me Madam]]'' even though the show's star, [[Ethel Merman]] was then under exclusive contract to Decca Records. This resulted in two albums of the score being released: Merman with a studio cast on her label, while the rest of the Broadway cast made an album for RCA Victor with [[Dinah Shore]] singing the Merman role.

The label that would dominate the field until the late 1970s, however, was [[Columbia Masterworks Records|Columbia]]. They began by issuing an album of the 1946 revival of ''[[Show Boat]]'' followed by the original Broadway cast of ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' in 1947. A year later the label introduced [[LP album|LP]] records and used the format for two best sellers: ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' and ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', both recorded and released in 1949.

Under the leadership of [[Columbia Masterworks Records|Columbia]]'s [[Goddard Lieberson]], the label's cast recordings came to define the genre. Columbia Masterworks produced the original cast recordings of such shows as ''[[The Pajama Game]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[West Side Story (Original Broadway Cast)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]'', and ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]''. Lieberson also recorded important shows that had failed at the box office including ''[[Candide (musical)|Candide]]'' and ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]''.  In 1956, he recorded [[Frank Loesser]]'s musical ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'', which had so much music that it had to be released as a 3-LP set, an almost unheard of venture for an original cast album in the 1950s.

A 1970 documentary by [[D. A. Pennebaker]], [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293475/ Original Cast Album—Company] gives a straightforward view of the making of a cast recording. It shows how the recording studio looks, how performers are arranged, and how the director behaves. The cast feels the pressure of delivering a definitive performance, with a degree of perfection beyond that ever required on stage, under a time limit imposed by the high cost of studio time.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s it was not uncommon for cast albums to become best sellers. ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[The Music Man]]'', ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]'', and ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' all reached the #1 position on the [[Billboard magazine]] best-sellers chart. As popular music split away from the traditional Tin Pan Alley song stylings of Broadway and Hollywood, and [[rock music]] became the dominant pop culture form, show albums began selling less well. Also, as radio and TV moved away from showcasing Broadway numbers the ability for a show to reach an audience beyond the traditional Broadway fans lessened.

Today few show albums even appear in the Billboard top 200, and the rare breakout hit like ''[[Wicked (musical album)|Wicked]]'' receives no radio airplay.

New boutique labels such as [[PS Classics]] and [[Ghostlight]] release many of the cast albums of recent Broadway hits. With the recent merger of [[Sony Music]] (formerly Columbia Records) and [[BMG Music]] (formerly RCA Victor), many older editions of cast recordings are being deleted and newly remastered editions are being released.

==Technical limitations==
A 10-inch 78-rpm disc could hold about {{frac|3|1|2}} minutes of music per side. A 12-inch 78-rpm could last {{frac|4|1|2}} minutes. Early albums had to severely abridge selections to fit the format. With LP cast recordings, usually released as single discs, it was not rare for compromises to be made to fit the recording within the forty-to-fifty-minute time limit. For example, reprises, or minor songs might not be included.

By the 1980s, the rise of the [[compact disc]] with its 74-minute recording capacity (which was increased to 80 minutes in the 1990s) resulted in improvements in cast recordings, which were now usually capable of including all songs, the full overture and entr'acte, and, when appropriate, lead-in dialogue to the songs.

In recent years, some cast recordings have been recorded live, in recording studios incorporated into the theater concerned. Otherwise, live recordings tend to trade sound quality for freshness and immediacy.

==Alternate versions==
It is often the case that many cast recordings may be made for the same show. In addition to the recording of the cast of the original production, later high-profile productions may also produce cast recordings: for example, a recording by the cast of the first London production of a show that originated on Broadway, or of the first Broadway cast of a show that originated [[off-Broadway]], or of the cast of a revival produced many decades later than the original production.

For some musicals created before cast recordings became the norm, studio cast recordings are all that exist to document the original productions' orchestrations.  Such studio cast recordings have been made of many early musical comedies by the Gershwins ([[George Gershwin]] and [[Ira Gershwin]]), [[Vincent Youmans]], and [[Rodgers and Hart]].

==Terms==
'''Original cast''': the premiere or original cast of the production (original Broadway cast; original London cast; original Toronto cast; original Australian cast, etc.). This can (rather confusingly) include revivals as well as first productions. Less misleading in this last case is "Revival Cast".

'''Studio cast''': assembled by a record company. In the early days, the studio cast singers were often lesser known performers with good singing voices, usually joined by one fairly well known star. [[Mary Martin]] made a number of studio cast recordings for Columbia in the early 1950s including ''[[Babes in Arms]]'', ''[[Girl Crazy]]'', and ''[[Anything Goes]]''. More recent studio albums have tended to be note-complete recreations of the original orchestrations, often with well-known singers (not infrequently from the world of opera rather than musical theatre) taking the leads: such as EMI's recordings of  ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'' and ''[[Show Boat]]''.

The performers who appear in Broadway shows sing the score live each night. When a Broadway cast album is made, it is (as a rule) recorded in a studio and produced with the home listener in mind (although live recordings of the original cast are not unknown). While it is strictly correct (if misleading) to call a movie soundtrack a "cast recording" since it does record the performances of the film cast, it is even more misleading, not to mention incorrect, to call any recording a "soundtrack" that has no connection with a motion picture or recorded television production.

'''[[Soundtrack album]]s''' fill a very similar function for films with music. Soundtrack and cast albums sometimes have much in common, especially when the film concerned is a motion picture version of an original stage musical, and it often makes sense for record shops to put the two genres in the same section. But the cast album of a stage musical is very specifically not a soundtrack.

==Major label cast albums==

===Decca===
[[Decca Broadway]], known from the 1940s until the 1990s simply as Decca Records, is the label that began the trend in North America. They released 78-rpm album sets of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'', ''[[One Touch of Venus]]'', ''[[Carmen Jones]]'', ''[[Bloomer Girl]]'', ''[[Song of Norway]]'', ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', ''[[Call Me Mister]]'', and ''[[Lost in the Stars]]''.  Many of these were transferred to LP in 1949/1950 although sometimes songs were abridged or left out completely. The label added more titles to their cast album library in the early 1950s: ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', ''[[Wonderful Town]]'', ''[[Seventh Heaven (musical)|Seventh Heaven]]'', ''[[On Your Toes]]'', and ''[[Anchors Aweigh]]''. In 1968, Decca issued a 2-LP set of the London cast of ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'', an album which featured almost the complete show (the Broadway cast album had been recorded by [[Kapp Records]]).

In 1949, Decca began to re-release the best-selling of these albums on LP and in the late 1950s began offer electronically enhanced for stereo editions.

The label was out of the business of recording new cast albums by the end of the 1950s. Decca was bought by MCA and in the early 1970s many of these titles were re-released on the MCA label, all using the fake stereo masters.

MCA released many of their classic shows on CD in the 1990s, going back to original master discs and tapes to generate excellent sounding (and complete) remasters of the originals. When MCA and Polygram were merged into the new Universal Music Group, a new label, Decca Broadway, was born. Decca Broadway has re-mastered and reissued virtually every cast album in the old Decca catalogue including many rare titles that had not been available in almost 50 years. Decca Broadway has also recorded recent hits including: ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', ''[[Monty Python's Spamalot]]'', ''[[Seussical]]'', and ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]''. It has not, however, released the London cast album of ''Man of La Mancha'' on CD, perhaps because it contains most of the dialogue from the show, and the film version is readily available on DVD. ''Wicked'', in particular has been a big seller for the label and continues to sell well.  Although they are being selective about what they record, Decca Broadway plans to continue making cast albums, including the [[Mel Brooks]] musical ''[[Young Frankenstein (musical)|Young Frankenstein]]'' and [[Andrew Lippa]]'s ''[[The Addams Family (musical)|The Addams Family: A New Musical]]''. Although some of the slower-selling catalog titles have been deleted, many remain available as downloads.

===Capitol===
[[Capitol Records|Capitol]] recorded ''[[St. Louis Woman]]'' in 1946, mainly because lyricist Johnny Mercer was one of the label's founders.  It wasn't until the 1950s, however, that the label began bidding for cast album rights. Their first few choices were generally not big hits: ''[[Flahooley]]'', ''[[Top Banana (musical)|Top Banana]]'', ''[[Three Wishes for Jamie]]'', and the revival of ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]''. They finally got a hit show in 1953 with Cole Porter's ''[[Can-Can (musical)|Can-Can]]'', which remained in print until the end of the LP era.  Recordings featuring the film casts of three [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] films (''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', and ''[[The King and I]]'') were also released on Capitol during the 1950s, all earning [[RIAA]] gold record awards.  An even bigger hit came along in 1957 with ''[[The Music Man]]'', which reached the #1 spot on the Billboard charts and stayed there for 12 weeks. It was also the label's first stereo cast album. They scored another bestseller in 1964 when Barbra Streisand's label Columbia Records passed on recording ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]''. Capitol recorded it, and the album became a million seller.  Without a TV/radio network affiliation (such as Columbia had with CBS and RCA with NBC) Capitol sometimes had to content themselves with "also-ran" shows.  The 1960s found them with recording rights to a number of minor hits: ''[[No Strings]]'', ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]'', and ''[[Golden Boy (musical)|Golden Boy]]'' but mostly they got flop shows: ''[[Sail Away (musical)|Sail Away]]'', ''[[Kwamina (musical)|Kwamina]]'', ''[[The Gay Life]]'', ''[[Skyscraper (musical)|Skyscraper]]'', ''[[Walking Happy]]'', and ''[[Zorba (musical)|Zorba]]''. They did record Stephen Sondheim's Broadway debut as a composer with ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', but in 1971 they came under fire for refusing to record the complete score of Sondheim's ''[[Follies]]'' as a 2-LP set. The label executives complained that "cast albums don't sell" ignoring the ongoing success of ''Funny Girl'' and ''The Music Man'' and the fact that many of their shows had been outright flops. ''Follies'' was truncated to a single LP missing four songs and abridging many of the others. It would be Capitol's last original cast album.

EMI's classical division took over the Capitol Broadway cast catalogue in 1992 and reissued all 40 of the cast albums on the Broadway Angel label. The CDs were well packaged with booklets containing detailed notes and production photos.  Although only a half dozen of these releases are still in print as of October 2007, most of the deleted titles have been reissued by DRG keeping the scores available for collectors.

Broadway Angel has recorded some recent shows such as: ''[[Crazy for You (musical)|Crazy for You]]'', ''[[Passion (musical)|Passion]]'', ''[[The Color Purple (musical)|The Color Purple]]'', and ''[[Curtains (musical)|Curtains]]'', the 1994 Broadway revival of ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', as well as the Bernadette Peters revivals of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' and ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]''.

===RCA Victor===
[[RCA Victor Records|RCA Victor]] entered the cast album field in 1947 with two hits and a miss: ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'', ''[[High Button Shoes]]'', and Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's ''[[Allegro (musical)|Allegro]]''.  ''Brigadoon'' was a big seller and remains in print on CD today. ''High Button Shoes'' was a hit show but the album did not do well. RCA's budget label, Camden, reissued it on LP in 1958 and Victor re-released it in 1965. At that time they also did the first LP transfer of ''Allegro''.

As the LP era dawned, Victor competed with Columbia for cast album rights. Their first LP release was Irving Berlin's ''[[Call Me Madam]]'' but because the star Ethel Merman was under contract to Decca, she was replaced on Victor's album by Dinah Shore. The album was a failure and was out of print until Red Seal reissued it in 1977.  Victor did better with ''[[Paint Your Wagon (musical)|Paint Your Wagon]]'', and ''[[Damn Yankees]]'', but had their share of flops: ''[[Seventeen (musical)|Seventeen]]'', ''[[Make a Wish (musical)|Make a Wish]]'', ''[[Hazel Flagg]]'', and ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]'', along with minor hits ''[[Me and Juliet]]'', ''[[Happy Hunting]]'', ''[[New Girl in Town]]'', ''[[Jamaica (musical)|Jamaica]]'', ''[[Redhead (musical)|Redhead]]'', ''[[Take Me Along]]'', ''[[Do Re Mi (musical)|Do Re Mi]]'', ''[[Wildcat (musical)|Wildcat]]'', and ''[[Milk and Honey (musical)|Milk and Honey]]''.

In the 1960s, Victor did better with the Tony award winners ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'', ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', and ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''.  They hit the top of the charts with ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' in 1968. During this time it also released five of the cast albums from the [[Music Theatre of Lincoln Center]] revivals, ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' with Patrice Munsel, ''[[Show Boat]]'' with [[Barbara Cook]], [[Constance Towers]], [[Stephen Douglass]], [[David Wayne]], and [[William Warfield]], ''[[Kismet (musical)|Kismet]]'' with [[Alfred Drake]], ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' with [[Ethel Merman]], ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' with [[John Raitt]], and ''[[The King and I]]'' with [[Rise Stevens]] and [[Darren McGavin]].

In 1976, [[Thomas Z. Shepard]] left Columbia Records for RCA's Classical division and under his guidance RCA Red Seal eclipsed Columbia as the dominant label for cast albums. Shepard recorded Sondheim's scores for ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[Sunday in the Park With George]]'', and ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', the 1977 Broadway revival recording of ''[[The King and I]]'', as well as the hits ''[[Ain't Misbehavin' (musical)|Ain't Misbehavin']]'', ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]'', and ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]''.

In 1985, Shepard staged an all-star concert to make a complete recording of Sondheim's ''[[Follies]]''. When pre-production costs escalated, label president [[Jose Menendez]] wanted to cancel the recording. Shepard held his ground and won the battle. The 2-LP set was a bestseller and made profit within a month of release. Early in 1986 Shepard resigned and went to MCA.

With the rise of compact discs in the late 1980s, RCA was bought out by BMG. At this time Bill Rosenfield used RCA Victor to re-release the label's vast catalogue of show albums on CD and to record new shows including: ''[[Into The Woods]]'', ''[[Jerome Robbins' Broadway]]'', ''[[Grand Hotel (musical)|Grand Hotel]]'', ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (musical)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', ''[[Titanic (musical)|Titanic]]'', ''[[Steel Pier (musical)|Steel Pier]]'', ''[[Ragtime (musical)|Ragtime]]'', ''[[Fosse]]'', ''[[The Full Monty (musical)|The Full Monty]]'',  ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'', ''[[Urinetown]]'', and ''[[Avenue Q]]''. During this time RCA Victor also released the cast recordings for the Broadway revivals of ''[[Anything Goes]]'' (1987), ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1992), ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' (1996), ''[[Candide (musical)|Candide]]'' (1997), ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' (1998), ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (1998), ''[[You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown]]'' (1999), and ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' (2002).

Many of the older, more obscure titles were deleted in 1999/2000 but the catalogue remains active. The merger between Sony and BMG in 2004 has resulted in a new label called Masterworks Broadway and now that Sony has taken over the entire operation they have started allowing outside companies such as DRG to re-release many of the rarer cast albums from the combined Columbia and RCA Victor cataogs.

===Columbia===
[[Columbia Records|Columbia]]'s first original Broadway cast album was the 1946 revival of ''[[Show Boat]]'', soon followed by an album of ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]''. In 1948 Columbia introduced the Lp to the record market and soon offered LP editions of their 78-rpm sets.  The first cast album recorded as an LP was Cole Porter's ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'', which was a big hit on records and was followed by the blockbuster Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''. The producer of these albums was Goddard Lieberson, who brought unquestionable taste and skill to translating a Broadway show to records. He didn't just record the songs. It was his goal to make the album an enjoyable listening experience for home listeners who, quite often, had not even seen the shows.  Recorded in an old converted church on 30th street in New York City, Columbia's albums had a lush, open, spacious sound. When stereo came along in the late 1950s, Lieberson used stereo placement to enhance the performances but avoided any gimmicks. As a result, Columbia's albums of ''[[Kismet (musical)|Kismet]]'', ''[[The Pajama Game]]'', ''[[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells Are Ringing]]'', and ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' remain classics in the field.

In 1956, Lieberson persuaded CBS to put up the entire capitalization for Lerner and Loewe's ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. This ensured that Columbia got the cast album rights and that CBS held all film and TV rights to the property.  The show was the biggest hit of the decade, selling out for nearly 6 years on Broadway. The original cast album reached #1 on the Billboard charts, and stayed on the charts for nine years. Because the Broadway cast had been recorded only in monaural, when the cast opened it in London Columbia re-recorded it in stereo. The label later offered the film soundtrack and a 1976 20th anniversary revival cast albums as well as recordings in French, Italian, Spanish and Hebrew.

The profits from the ''My Fair Lady'' album financed many of Columbia's subsequent original cast and classical recordings.

The label recorded Frank Loesser's near sung-through musical ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'', virtually complete and issued it as a 3-record set as well as a single Lp of highlights.  Lieberson made sure that important scores were recorded even if the shows were not box office successes. Thanks to his foresight the original casts of  ''[[Candide (musical)|Candide]]'', ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'', and ''[[Goldilocks (musical)|Goldilocks]]'' are preserved.

Columbia recorded as many hits as they did flops - ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'', ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'',  ''[[Sweet Charity]]'', ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'', ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]'', ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', ''[[West Side Story]]'', ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'', ''[[A Little Night Music]]'', and ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]''.

In the 1980s, the label began to withdraw from the cast album field as RCA began to dominate it. Sony bought CBS records in the late 1980s and began reissuing many older cast albums on the Sony Broadway label in 1991–94 and later the Sony Columbia Broadway Masterworks labels. The few, mainly obscure flops, that Sony chose not to reissue were farmed out to DRG and other specialty labels.

The merger between Sony and BMG in 2004 has resulted in a new label called Masterworks Broadway and now that Sony has taken over the entire operation they have started allowing outside companies such as DRG to re-release many of the rarer cast albums from the combined Columbia and RCA Victor catalogs. Masterworks Broadway has also launched a new website (www.masterworksbroadway.com) offering the combined Victor and Columbia catalogs.

'''Comedy horror''' is a [[literary genre|literary]] and [[film genre]] that combines elements of [[comedy]] and [[horror fiction]]. Comedy horror has been described as able to be categorized under three types: "black comedy, parody and spoof."&lt;ref name="Miller 2004 p. 1" /&gt; It often crosses over with the [[black comedy]] genre. Comedy horror can also parody or subtly spoof horror [[cliché]]s as its main source of humour or use those elements to take a story in a different direction, for example in ''[[The Cabin in the Woods]]''.

Author Bruce G. Hallenbeck cites the short story "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]" by [[Washington Irving]] as "the first great comedy horror story".&lt;ref name="hallenbeck1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallenbeck|2009|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story made readers "laugh one moment and scream the next", and its premise was based on mischief typically found during the holiday [[Halloween]].&lt;ref name="hallenbeck1" /&gt;

== In literature ==
Horror and comedy have been associated with each other since the early days of horror novels.  Shortly after the publication of ''Frankenstein'', comedic parodies appeared.  [[Edgar Allan Poe]] put humor and horror on the same continuum, and many nineteenth century authors used black humor in their horror stories.  Author [[Robert Bloch]] called them "opposite sides of the same coin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=432309|title=Horror and Humor|last=Carroll|first=Noel|work=[[The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism]]|pages=145–146|volume=57|issue=2|date=Spring 1999|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In film ==
In comedy horror film, [[gallows humor]] is a common element. While comedy horror films provide scares for audiences, they also provide something that dramatic [[horror film]]s do not: "the permission to laugh at your fears, to whistle past the cinematic graveyard and feel secure in the knowledge that the monsters can't get you".&lt;ref name="hallenbeck1" /&gt;

In the era of [[silent film]], the source material for early comedy horror films came from stage performances instead of literature. One example, ''[[The Ghost Breaker (1914 film)|The Ghost Breaker]]'' (1914), was based on a 1909 play, though the film's horror elements were more interesting to the audience than the comedy elements. In the United States following the trauma of [[World War I]], film audiences sought to see horror on screen but tempered with humor. The "pioneering" comedy horror film was ''[[One Exciting Night]]'' (1922), written, directed, and produced by [[D. W. Griffith]], who noticed the stage success of the genre and foresaw a cinematic translation. While the film included [[blackface]] performances, Griffith also included footage of a hurricane for a climactic storm. As an early experiment, the various genres were not well-balanced with horror and comedy, and later films improved the balance and took more sophisticated approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallenbeck|2009|pp=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Bramesco of [[Vulture.com]] identifies ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' as the first commercially successful comedy horror film. Its success legitimized the genre and established it as commercially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/history-of-horror-comedy-in-11-crucial-films.html|title=The History of Horror-Comedy in 11 Crucial Films|last=Bramesco|first=Charles|work=[[Vulture.com]]|date=22 October 2015|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Ben''' is a Canadian [[stage magician]], [[sleight of hand]] artist, [[illusionist]], author, publisher, [[keynote speaker]], magic historian, [[magic consultant]], magic collector and former [[tax lawyer]].

He has been a professional magician, performer, entertainer and keynote speaker since 1990. Ben is known for his sleight-of-hand technique, his knowledge of magic history and his collection of magic.

He is one of the founders of ''Magicana''—a performing arts organization dedicated to the study, exploration and advancement of magic as a performing art—and currently serves its Artistic Director. He is the publisher and editor of ''Magicol'', a quarterly journal of magic history and collectibles. He is the sole protégé of a fellow Canadian, twentieth century sleight-of-hand artist, Ross Bertram, and biographer (and representative of the Estate) of celebrated magician, [[Dai Vernon]].

==Early life and education==
Ben was born March 5, 1961 and raised in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. His interest in magic began after receiving the book, ''The Stein and Day Handbook of Magic'' by Marvin Kaye from his father in 1973. Ben's childhood interest turned into a lifelong passion after he watched the television special '''[[Doug Henning's World of Magic]]'' (1975). Ben became a frequent visitor to the Arcade Magic and Novelty Company in Toronto, and then Morrissey Magic Ltd. While in high school, Ben worked part-time at Morrissey Magic, learning the craft from store founder and Canadian magician, Herb Morrissey.

In 1978, Ben acquired the book ''The Magic and Methods of Ross Bertram'' and in 1979, through Morrissey, Msgr. [[Vincent Foy]] and P. Howard Lyons, met the book's author, Ross Bertram. Ben studied magic with Bertram for six years (1980–86) and became Bertram's sole protégé.

Ben graduated with a BA from University College of the [[University of Toronto]] (1983), an LLB from the [[University of Western Ontario]] (1987) and an LLM from the [[London School of Economics]] (1988). He articled at the firm of Macdonald &amp; Hayden, was called to the bar in the [[Province of Ontario]] in 1989, and joined the firm of Goodman, Phillips and Vineberg (now Goodmans) as a tax lawyer.

However in 1990, after producing a series of conventions, lectures and magic shows, Ben abandoned the conventional lawyer's life to pursue the art of magic.

==Charity, outreach and education==
In May 2000, Ben co-founded, along with broadcaster Patrick Watson and producer/director Daniel Zuckerbrot, [[Magicana]], a not-for-profit organization (and now a registered Canadian charity) dedicated to exploration and advancement of magic as a performing art.

He also assisted his wife Jan Howlett, an accomplished educator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wente|first=Margaret|title=A radical alternative: real teaching|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/a-radical-alternative-real-teaching/article790636/?service=mobile|accessdate=September 11, 2013|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former Director of Public Programming and Education for the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], and Executive Director of the [[Children's Own Museum]] with the formation of her own school, the Howlett Academy, an independent school (JK–Grade 8) located in Toronto. When Howlett died&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kane|first=Laura|title=Toronto private school crusader Jan Howlett dieshttps://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/07/16/toronto_private_school_crusader_jan_howlett_dies.html|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/07/16/toronto_private_school_crusader_jan_howlett_dies.html|accessdate=September 11, 2013|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shanahan|first=Noreen|title=Educator Jan Howlett was a 'Picasso of curriculum'|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/educator-jan-howlett-was-a-picasso-of-curriculum/article13909997/|accessdate=September 11, 2013|newspaper=The Globe &amp; Mail|location=Toronto|date=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on July 14, 2013 from brain cancer, Ben assumed the role of director for the Howlett Academy.

In 2005, Ben developed ''My Magic Hands'', an outreach program designed to teach creativity and develop self-confidence and self-esteem in disadvantaged youth through the medium of magic. The program received a significant pilot funding in 2005 followed by a subsequent multi-year funding grant from the Ontario Trillium Foundation (2005–2008).

In 2005, inspired by his friend the late [[Tom Kneebone]] and the Smile Theatre Company, Ben created ''Senior Sorcery'', a program designed to bring magic shows to immobile seniors, the goal being to create intergenerational opportunities for the old to invite the young to share the experience of magic. Magicana continues to offer ''Senior Sorcery'' to thousands of seniors, their families and friends at centers around Toronto.

In 2009, Ben acquired the collection of late Canadian magic icon, Sid Lorraine, adding it to his already considerable magic holdings. Ben's holdings also include the collection of Stewart James, Willis Kenney, David Drake, Bruce Posgate, and items belonging to Dai Vernon (including props from the famed ''Harlequin Act''). Ben developed a number of online exhibitions for Magicana including ''Ross Bertram, Master Magician'' 2010; ''Sid Lorraine: The Magical Chatterbox'' 2009; ''The Life &amp;amp; Magic of Stewart James'' 2007 (in collaboration with PhD student Joe Culpepper); ''Postcards of Magicians'' 2005, 2010; and ''Bert Douglas: A Family Remembers'' 2005, 2010).

===The Conjuror (1996, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2014)===

[[File:Ben watson.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Patrick Watson and David Ben 1996 promotional photo|Patrick Watson and David Ben 1996 promotional photo for ''The Conjuror'' for the Shaw Festival]]
''The Conjuror'' was a theatrical recreation of a performance by a celebrated (but fictitious) Canadian conjuror at St. George's Hall in London circa 1909. The play was developed by Ben and Canadian broadcasting icon, [[Patrick Watson (producer)|Patrick Watson]], after a chance encounter between the two at the home of Canadian media mogul and magic aficionado [[Slaight Communications|Allan Slaight]].

''The Conjuror'', with set and costumes by Kelly Wolf, had its world premiere at the [[Shaw Festival]] in 1996. The show had outstanding box office and critical reviews. [[Christopher Newton]], Artistic Director of the Shaw Festival, "dip[ped] his imagination in the Golden Age of Magic"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fotheringham|first=Allan|newspaper=The Financial Post|date=July 22, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and invited Ben and Watson to revisit ''The Conjuror'' the following season. ''The Conjuror&amp;nbsp;– Part 2'', with set design by William Schmuck and lighting by Bonnie Beecher, had its world premiere at the Shaw Festival in 1997 featuring "seven illusions accomplished with panache".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coles|first=Penny|newspaper=Niagara Advance|date=July 19, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, Ben and Watson amalgamated ''The Conjuror'' and ''The Conjuror – Part 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kershaw|first=Rogers|title=It's Magic at the Shaw|url=http://www.stage-door.org/reviews/shaw97.htm#con|publisher=Stage Door Review|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' into ''The Compleat Conjuror'' for a special gala fundraising performance for the Festival.&lt;ref&gt;''The Compleat Conjuror'' August 10, 1997 at the Royal George Theatre, [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]]&amp;nbsp;– Dinner and show gala fund raising event&lt;/ref&gt;

While Ben and Watson were developing ''The Conjuror'', Ben became reacquainted with Daniel Zuckerbrot. Zuckerbrot, a documentary filmmaker, retained Ben to levitate [[David Suzuki]], the host of [[The Nature of Things]], for a Zuckerbrot film "[[Martin Gardner]]: Mathemagician" (1995). Zuckerbrot proposed recording the development of ''The Conjuror''.  The result was "A Conjuror in the Making" (1997), which aired on the ''[[Adrienne Clarkson]] Presents&lt;ref&gt;''[[Adrienne Clarkson Presents]]''. Season 1, Episode 132. Original air date: March 13, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;'' on the CBC and on ''[[Breakfast with the Arts]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Breakfast With the Arts''. Original air date: July 6, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[A&amp;E Network]] in the United States. The film follows magician David Ben and director Patrick Watson through rehearsal, show development and finally to the opening night performance at the Shaw Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bawden|first=Jim|title=TV Worth Watching|newspaper=The Toronto Star, Star Weekly|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary won gold at [[WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival]], and the Chris Statuette at the [[Columbus International Film &amp;amp; Video Festival]].

In 1997, [[Lindsay Sharp]], then Director of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], invited Ben to stage ''The Conjuror'' at the ROM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooker|first=Evan|newspaper=The Globe &amp;amp; Mail|date=December 4, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben and his team refurbished the theatre in the Museum&amp;nbsp;– a theatre that had been dormant for theatrical productions for 35 years. A 90-minute version of ''The Conjuror'' opened in December 1997 at Theatre ROM and ran for four months. It then embarked on a regional theatre tour of Ontario in the summer of 1998 "deftly conjuring [a] charming show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mazey|first=Steven|title=Magician deftly conjures charming show|newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen|date=October 22, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was remounted to continued acclaim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ouzounian|first=Richard|title=Ben conjures up Harry|newspaper=TheToronto Star|date=December 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ouzounian|first=Richard|title=All ages, that's the trick|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=December 11, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Toronto in 2002, now with original music by John Lang, and ran for six weeks.

''The Conjuror'' was remounted in December 2014 for a limited-engagement of 12 shows for six days for [[Soulpepper Theatre]].

===The Conjuror's Suite (1999, 2000)===
In 1999, Ben and Watson created a new 90-minute show&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crew|first=Robert|title=Conjuror David Ben has a few old tricks up his sleeve|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=November 27, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;—''The Conjuror's Suite''—an exploration of [[parlor magic]] inspired by the work of [[Robert-Houdin|Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hofzinser]] and [[Max Malini]]. With Ed Kotanen's design and Bonnie Beecher's lighting, Ben and Watson created a three-quarter surround theatre in the Garfield Weston Exhibition Hall at the Royal Ontario Museum for the show. ''The Conjuror's Suite'' received critical acclaim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wagner|first=Vit|title=Not just another little card trick|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=December 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Kevin|title=Sharp tricks, shallow gags|newspaper=Eye|date=December 9, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ben was invited to restage the work by Curtis Barlow at the [[Charlottetown Festival]] in Prince Edward Island for the summer of 2000.

===Tricks (2004)===
[[File:Ben butterfly.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=David Ben animating two butterflies|David Ben animates two butterflies in ''Natural Magick'' part of the 2011 Luminato Festival]]
Collaborating again with Watson, Ben wrote a new theatrical work, ''Tricks''—a post-modern show focusing on the classics of magic. He returned to the stage with critical success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crew|first=Robert|title=Two Thumbs up for Tricks|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=December 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kap|first=Jon|title=Nimble Tricks|newspaper=NOW Magazine|date=Dec 16–22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cushman|first=Robert|title=Theatre|newspaper=National Post|date=December 21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Al-Solaylee|first=Kamal|title=Bright Spot in a string of Tricks|newspaper=The Globe &amp;amp; Mail|date=December 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designer credits: set design by David Rayfield, lighting by Bonnie Beecher and an original score by John Lang. The work was presented in 2004 at Artword Theatre (Toronto) in collaboration with [[Magicana]].

===Natural Magick (2011)===
In 2011, Ben mounted a new show, ''Natural Magick'' which was produced by Magicana in collaboration with the ''Luminato'' Festival. This show was inspired by John Baptista della Porta's 1558 scientific treatise, "[[Magia Naturalis|Natural Magick]]", [[Shahrazad]]'s tales, [[Kenneth Burke]]'s ''A Grammar of Motives'' and the modern notions of magic as espoused by master magician, [[Dai Vernon]]. The new work featured a set by David Rayfield and multimedia imagery by Cameron Davis, lighting by Bonnie Beecher and music by John Lang. Ben presented new sleight-of-hand pieces from his repertoire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Medley|first=Mark|title=David Ben's tricks of the trade|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2011/06/14/david-bens-tricks-of-the-trade/#more-37068|accessdate=August 5, 2011|newspaper=The National Post|date=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received critical acclaim for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mooney|first=Sam|title=Luminato 2011 Review&amp;nbsp;– Natural Magick: David Ben|url=http://www.mooneyontheatre.com/2011/06/11/luminato-2011-review-natural-magick-david-ben-produced-in-association-with-magicana/|publisher=Mooney on Theatre|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall|first=Lindsay|title=Luminato 2011: Natural Magick|url=http://www.pressplus1.com/arts-culture/natural-magick.html|publisher=Press Plus 1|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Godfrey|first=Laura|title=A Magical Night Out at Luminato|url=http://torontoist.com/2011/06/a_magical_night_out_at_luminato.php|publisher=Torontoist|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natural Magick'' was a top pick for the Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Landau|first=Emily|title=Tuesday's Luminato picks: Andromache, Raj Kapoor and David Ben's Natural Magick|url=http://www.torontolife.com/daily/hype/to-do-list/2011/06/14/tuesday-luminato-picks|publisher=Toronto Life|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Natural Magick'' was presented as part of the Master of Magic series for Luminato at the Tarragon Theatre (Toronto).

===Card Table Artifice (2014)===
In 2014, Ben wrote, performed and directed, ''Card Table Artifice'' which was produced by Magicana in collaboration with the Luminato Festival. The show was a new work based on A Man in a Room, Gambling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Man in a Room, Gambling|url=http://www.artangel.org.uk//projects/1997/a_man_in_a_room_gambling/about_the_project/a_man_in_a_room_gambling|website=Artangel|publisher=Artangel|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally created by [[Gavin Bryars]] and [[Juan Muñoz]].

==Producer==
Ben produced a number of magic conventions, lectures and magic shows including NYCAN '83 (convention), a gathering of 300 magicians. In the same year, he also became one of the first to produce [[Penn &amp;amp; Teller]] in their two-man show at the Ritz Theatre in Toronto.

In 2003, Ben started producing through Magicana, and in association with Allan Slaight, a conference called ''31 Faces North'' in which he and Slaight invited thirty-one of the world's foremost experts and practitioners of magic and promising young magicians to participate in a four-day think-tank of magic. The attendees represented a who's who of magic including Guest of Honours: [[Jay Marshall (magician)|Jay Marshall]] (2003), [[Tommy Wonder (magician)|Tommy Wonder]] (2003), [[Johnny Thompson]] (2004), Harry Riser (2004), [[Billy McComb]] (2005), [[Charles Reynolds (magician)|Charles Reynolds]] (2005), [[Max Maven]] (2006), Bob White (2006), Roberto Giobbi (2007), Stephen Minch (2007), Ton Onosaka (2008), [[Herb Zarrow]] (2008), Michael Weber (2009), Bob Sheets (2009), Gaëtan Bloom (2010) and [[Jim Steinmeyer]] (2010). Filmmaker, Daniel Zuckerbrot recorded each session, all of which is now housed in the archives of Magicana.

In 2009 Ben became Director of the Magic Collectors Association, publisher and editor of its journal, ''Magicol'' and the convention chair for the annual gathering, the ''Magic Collectors Weekend''. 2010 marked the 41st conference. Ben continues to serve as producer and Convention Chair of that event.

In 2010, Ben was invited to program and produce the ''Masters of Magic'' series for [[Luminato]], a festival of creativity and the arts held in Toronto. For Luminato 2010, he produced magicians Bob Sheets, ''The [[Mac King]] Comedy Show'', Max Maven's ''Thinking in Person'', and North American theatrical premiere of Spain's [[Juan Tamariz]] at the Panasonic Theatre.

In 2011 Ben was again called upon by Luminato to curate magic for the Festival. He produced three shows: ''Toast of the Town'' (Eric Mead), ''Natural Magick'' and ''Vodvil''. While ''Natural Magick'' featured magic performed by David Ben, ''Vodvil'' involved five magic acts by artists of international acclaim&amp;nbsp;– namely, [[Johnny Thomson|The Great Tomsoni &amp;amp; Company]] (John and Pam Thompson), [[Mike Caveney]], [[Tina Lenert]], Ardan James and Gaëtan Bloom (of France). "Vodvil" was presented in the historic [[Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres|Winter Garden Theatre]] in Toronto keeping in step with the vaudevillian theme of the show.

In 2012 Ben produced, in association with [[Magicana]], three new programs for [[Luminato]]. The first was ''The Alpha Project'' by the mentalist, [[Banachek]]; ''The Cheat'' by [[Richard Turner (magician)|Richard Turner]]; and ''From The Dark'' by Chilean magician Juan Esteban Varela.

In 2013 Ben also produced in association with [[Magicana]], three more programs for [[Luminato]]: ''Concerto for Piano &amp; Pasteboards'' by Spanish magician, Miguel Puga; ''Chamber Magic'' by [[Steve Cohen (magician)|Steve Cohen]]; and ''Compositions'' by magician Rafael Benatar. In addition to producing these live performances, Ben produced in association with Magicana and Reel Time Images, a film ''The Devil's Playthings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Devil's Playthings (II) (2013)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2943266/?ref_=rvi_tt|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', a short, fantasy film mixing cinema and sleight-of-hand.

For 2014, Ben again produced (in association with [[Magicana]]), two programs for [[Luminato]] themed as ''Transgressive Magic''. The first was ''Bullet Catch'' a magic/performance art show written and performed by Scottish performer, Rob Drummond, about the (fictional) case of William Henderson, a magician apparently killed in front of 2,000 people while performing the famed bullet catch in 1912. The second was ''Card Table Artifice'' written by David Ben and composed by [[Gavin Bryars]] and presented as a performance art piece with the simultaneous presentation of Ben performing card table artistry, Bryars leading a string quartet and narration by Canadian actor, [[RH Thomson]]. The show also included an opening act by magician, [[Rob Zabrecky]].

{{for|the television adaptation|Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas (TV program)}}
[[File:EmmetOttersJugBandChristmas.jpg|thumb|First edition of ''Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas'']]
'''''Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas''''' is a 1971 children's book written by [[Russell Hoban]] and illustrated by [[Lillian Hoban]]. It was adapted for a [[Muppets]] [[Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas|television special of the same name]] in 1977.

==Russell Hoban storybook==
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}
''Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas'' was written by [[Russell Hoban]] and illustrated by his then-wife, [[Lillian Hoban]], in 1969. The book was published in 1971 by [[Parents' Magazine Press]]. The story tells of Emmet [[Otter]] and his Ma, a widow who scrapes by on the small amount of money she gets from doing laundry and that Emmet gets from doing odd jobs around their home in the town of Frogtown Hollow despite both of them often being cheated. Some of the people who cheated them are Old Lady [[Opossum|Possum]] and Gretchen [[Fox]] (the wife of [[Mayor]] Harrison Fox). As Christmas approaches, they hear of a talent contest in the nearby town of Waterville, and separately decide to enter to buy nice presents for each other—a nice guitar for Emmet, or a piano for Ma. However, in a twist on ''[[The Gift of the Magi]]'' by [[O. Henry]], they must sacrifice each other's livelihood for the talent contest. Ma [[pawnbroker|hocks]] Emmet's tools for dress fabric while Emmet turns Ma's washtub into a [[washtub bass]] for a [[jug band]].

==Jim Henson television special==

'''''Fallout 1.5: Resurrection''''' is a [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]] for ''[[Fallout 2]]''. Developed by four fans of the game from the [[Czech Republic]], a version was released there on 3 October 2013. Working on the mod during their free time, the development took approximately 10 years. The mod offers a completely new story and locations. It is estimated that finishing the game takes 25 hours.&lt;ref name=Bonusweb1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brabec|first1=Andrej|title=Milují postapokalyptickou hru Fallout a deset let vyvíjeli vlastní verzi|url=http://bonusweb.idnes.cz/fandovska-verze-fallout-1-5-resurrection-fd0-/Novinky.aspx?c=A131004_125837_bw-novinky_anb|website=Bonusweb.cz|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Games&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smejkal|first1=Jan|title=Vyšla obří česká modifikace Resurrection pro Fallout 2|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/tema/vysla-obri-ceska-modifikace-resurrection-pro-fallout-2-64207|website=Games.cz|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
{{See also|Fallout (video game)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay in Fallout}}
The mod features the same gameplay as [[Fallout (series)|original games]]. The player is free to move at will until they enter into combat. Combat gives them a number of action points to move, fire, check their equipment, reload and the like. When a player uses up all of their action points, they end their turn and enemies start theirs. If the player survives unharmed, he or she has their action points restored. Injuries and poisons can reduce the number of action points available both in a single term and semi-permanently until combat ends and the player can be treated. Combat and completion of jobs or quests rewards the player with experience points with which they can level up their characters and apply beneficial perks to become more suited to the dangerous post-apocalyptic world. General gameplay consists of traveling and interacting with local inhabitants and organizations to complete goals and aid or inhibit the NPCs. The player's actions dictate what future story or gameplay opportunities are available. Mature themes such as alcohol consumption, drug usage and sex are present.&lt;ref name=Databaze1/&gt;

Organized crime, prostitution and slavery are major elements of the setting. Character creation is based on the SPECIAL role-playing system.

== Plot ==
The story is set in 2170 in what was once New Mexico. The injured protagonist wakes up in a cave with [[amnesia]]. They start to search for hints of their past but the only clue they have is a mysterious talisman.&lt;ref name=Eurocz1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harazím|first1=Aleš|title=Čeští fanoušci vydali modifikaci Fallout 1.5: Resurrection|url=http://www.eurogamer.cz/articles/2013-10-07-eti-fanouci-vydali-modifikaci-fallout-1-5-resurrection|website=Eurogamer.cz|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their way they come across a group of ghouls who act as though they know the player and then proceed to try and to kill them. The player then finds a dying ghoul named Thomas, who claims they were the player's best friend. Thomas reveals to the player that they are members of the Cult of the Rebirth, led by a person known as the Saviour. The cult has a machine that turns ghouls into normal humans. The problem is that turning a Ghoul human again requires at least one normal person and the turned person later dies of tissue decomposition. The protagonist is, along with the Saviour, one of turned Ghouls so it means that they will die as well. In the Rebirth base the player can choose whether they join the cult once again or destroy the cult.

If the player joins the cult once again, they can help the cult destroy the city of Albuquerque. But they will die in the battle. The Rebirth then dominates the whole area which foreshadows a conflict with the New California Republic.

The player can also destroy the base of the Rebirth which then terminates hope of the Ghouls to become normal again. The cult is destroyed and the protagonist goes to wasteland where they kill themself to avoid a slow death of a tissue decomposition.

==Development==
The development started in 2003 when the official editor and a script documentation for ''Fallout'' was released. It took 10 years because developers underestimated the project and many works. Because of it many things were changing during the development and the original idea of what would story be about was completely changed. The mod was completed and released in 2013. The English translated version of the mod was released on July 15, 2016.&lt;ref name=Bonusweb2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanáček|first1=Jan|title=ROZHOVOR: Byli jsme naivní, říká spoluautor úspěšné české Fallout hry|url=http://bonusweb.idnes.cz/fallout-1-5-resurrection-rozhovor-vaclav-panos-fqj-/Magazin.aspx?c=A140106_123225_bw-magazin_oz|website=Bonusweb.cz|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Databaze2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Panoš|first1=Václav|title=Zápisky moddera: Jak jsem pracoval na Fallout 1.5: Resurrection|url=http://www.databaze-her.cz/blog/zapisky-moddera-jak-jsem-pracoval-na-fallout-15-resurrection/|website=Databáze-her.cz|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception==
The mod has received mostly positive reviews since its release, with an average score of 75% at Czech videogame database Databaze-her.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2016}}

A '''first-person narrative''' is a [[narrative mode|mode of storytelling]] in which a narrator relays events from their own [[Narration#Narrative point of view|point of view]] using the [[grammatical person|first person ]] {{no wrap| i.e. "I" or "we", etc.}}&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview: First-person narrative|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095820156|website=Oxford Reference|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be narrated by a first person [[protagonist]] (or other [[focal character]]), first person re-teller, first person witness,&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; or first person peripheral (also called a peripheral narrator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Literature Glossary - First-person Narration|url=http://www.shmoop.com/literature-glossary/first-person-narration.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanzel1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanzel, F.K.|title=A Theory of Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uvs3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA208|date=13 March 1986|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-31063-5|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of a first person protagonist narrator is [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1847),&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; in which the [[title character]] is also the narrator telling her own story,&lt;ref name=schmoop1&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Eyre Narrator Point of View|url=http://www.shmoop.com/jane-eyre/narrator-point-of-view.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examples of Writing in First Person|url=http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-writing-in-first-person.html#OlI0VVEcAI4abdEW.99|website=YourDictionary|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This device allows the audience to see the narrator's [[mind's eye]] view of the [[fictional universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evers|first1=Stuart|title=The dangers of first-person narrative|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/may/13/thedangersoffirstpersonnar|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is limited to the narrator's experiences and awareness of the true state of affairs. In some stories, first-person narrators may relay dialogue with other characters or refer to information they heard from the other characters, in order to try to deliver a larger point of view.&lt;ref name=schmoop1/&gt; Other stories may switch the narrator to different characters to introduce a broader perspective. An [[unreliable narrator]] is one that has completely lost credibility due to ignorance, poor insight, personal biases, mistakes, dishonesty, etc., which challenges the reader's initial assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiehardt|first1=Ginny|title=How to Recognize and Create an Unreliable Narrator|url=https://www.thebalance.com/the-unreliable-narrator-in-fiction-1277141|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Balance|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Point of view device==
The telling of a story in the grammatical first person, i.e. from the perspective of "I." An example would be [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', which begins "Call me Ishmael."&lt;ref name=Perdue&gt;[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/terms/firstperson.html "First Person Narration", Perdue University College of Liberal Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narration often includes an embedded listener or reader, who serves as the audience for the tale.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt; First-person narrations may be told by a person directly undergoing the events in the story without being aware of conveying that experience to readers; alternatively, the narrator may be conscious of telling the story to a given audience, perhaps at a given place and time, for a given reason.

===Identity===
A story written in the first person can be told by the main character, a less important character witnessing events, or a person retelling a story they were told by someone else. This point of view is often effective in giving a sense of closeness to the character.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;{{cite web|title=Point of View and Narrative Voice|url=http://www.ohio.edu/people/hartleyg/ref/fiction/pov.html|website=Literary Analysis|publisher=Ohio University|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliability===
First-person narration presents the narrative through the perspective of a particular character. The reader or audience becomes aware of the events and characters of the story through the narrator's views and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid. ''The Narrator'', Iran:Baqney. 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; As a participant in events, the conscious narrator, is an imperfect witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. In some cases, the narrator may give or withhold information based on his own experience.

Character weaknesses and faults, such as tardiness, cowardice, or vice, may leave the narrator unintentionally absent or unreliable for certain key events. Specific events may further be colored or obscured by a narrator's background, since non-omniscient characters must by definition be laypersons and foreigners to some circles, and limitations such as poor eyesight and illiteracy may also leave important blanks. Another consideration is how much time has elapsed between when the character experienced the events of the story and when they decided to tell them. If only a few days have passed, the story could be related very differently than if the character was reflecting on events of the distant past. The character's motivation is also relevant. Are they just trying to clear up events for their own peace of mind? Make a confession about a wrong they did? Or tell a good adventure tale to their beer-guzzling friends? The reason why a story is told will also affect how it is written.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; Why is this narrator telling the story in this way, why now, and is he to be trusted? Unstable or malevolent narrators can also lie to the reader. [[Unreliable narrators]] are not uncommon.

In the first-person-plural [[Narrative mode|point of view]], narrators tell the story using "we". That is, no individual speaker is identified; the narrator is a member of a group that acts as a unit. The first-person-plural point of view occurs rarely but can be used effectively, sometimes as a means to increase the concentration on the character or characters the story is about. Examples include:

* [[William Faulkner]]'s short story "[[A Rose for Emily]]" (Faulkner was an avid experimenter in using unusual points of view; see also his ''[[Spotted Horses]]'', told in third person plural).
* [[Frank B. Gilbreth]] and [[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey]]'s memoir ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]''.
* [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short story "Crate."
* [[Frederik Pohl]]'s ''[[Man Plus]]''.
* [[Jeffrey Eugenides]]'s ''[[The Virgin Suicides]]''.
* [[Karen Joy Fowler]]'s ''[[The Jane Austen Book Club]]''.
* [[Joshua Ferris]]'s ''[[Then We Came to the End]]''.
* [http://thenormalschool.com/fiction/ Heidi Vornbrock Roosa's short story "Our Mother Who Art."]

Other examples include ''[[Twenty-Six Men and a Girl]]'' by [[Maxim Gorky]], ''The Treatment of Bibi Haldar'' by [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], ''During the Reign of the Queen of Persia'' by [[Joan Chase]], ''Our Kind'' by [[Kate Walbert]], ''[[I, Robot]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], and ''We Didn't'' by [[Stuart Dybek]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E3DF1538F93BA25757C0A9629C8B63|title=We the Characters|publisher=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2007-02-25|date=April 18, 2004 | first=Laura | last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narrators can also be multiple, as in [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]'s ''[[In a Grove]]'' (the source for the movie ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'') and [[William Faulkner|Faulkner's]] novel ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''. Each of these sources provides different accounts of the same event, from the point of view of various first-person narrators.

There can also be multiple co-principal characters as narrator, such as in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]''. The first chapter introduces four characters, including the initial narrator, who is named at the beginning of the chapter. The narrative continues in subsequent chapters with a different character explicitly identified as the narrator for that chapter. Other characters later introduced in the book also have their "own" chapters where they narrate the story for that chapter. The story proceeds in linear fashion, and no event occurs more than once, i.e. no two narrators speak "live" about the same event.

The first-person narrator may be the principal character or one who closely observes the principal character (see [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' or [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', each narrated by a minor character). These can be distinguished as "first person major" or "first person minor" points of view.

The narrator can be the [[protagonist]] (e.g., [[Lemuel Gulliver|Gulliver]] in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''), someone very close to him who is privy to his thoughts and actions ([[Dr. Watson]] in [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories), or an ancillary character who has little to do with the action of the story (such as Nick Carraway in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''). Narrators can report others' narratives at one or more removes. These are called "frame narrators": examples are Mr. Lockwood, the narrator in ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' by [[Emily Brontë]]; and the unnamed narrator in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]]. Skilled writers choose to skew narratives, in keeping with the narrator's character, to an arbitrary degree, from ever so slight to extreme. For example, the aforementioned Mr. Lockwood is quite naive, of which fact he appears unaware, simultaneously rather pompous, and recounting a combination of stories, experiences, and servants' gossip. As such, his character is an unintentionally very unreliable narrator, and serves mainly to mystify, confuse, and ultimately leave the events of Wuthering Heights open to a great range of interpretations.

A rare form of first person is the first person omniscient, in which the narrator is a character in the story, but also knows the thoughts and feelings of all the other characters. It can seem like third person omniscient at times. A reasonable explanation fitting the mechanics of the story's world is generally provided or inferred, unless its glaring absence is a major plot point. Two notable examples are ''[[The Book Thief]]'' by [[Markus Zusak]], where the narrator is [[Death]], and ''[[The Lovely Bones]]'' by [[Alice Sebold]], where a young girl, having been killed, observes, from some post-mortem, [[Out-of-body experience|extracorporeal]] viewpoint, her family struggling to cope with her disappearance. Typically, however, the narrator restricts the events relayed in the narrative to those that could reasonably be known. Novice writers may make the mistake of allowing elements of omniscience into a first-person narrative unintentionally and at random, forgetting the inherent human limitations of a witness or participant of the events.

==Autobiography==
In [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]], the first person narrator is the character of the author (with varying degrees of historical accuracy). The narrator is still distinct from the author and must behave like any other character and any other first person narrator. Examples of this kind of narrator include [[Jim Carroll]] in ''[[The Basketball Diaries]]'' and [[Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.]] in ''[[Timequake]]'' (in this case, the first-person narrator is also the author). In some cases, the narrator is writing a book—"the book in your hands"—and therefore he has most of the powers and knowledge of the author. Examples include ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' by [[Umberto Eco]], and ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' by [[Mark Haddon]]. Another example is a fictional "Autobiography of James T. Kirk"  which was "Edited" by David A. Goodman who was the actual writer of that book and playing the part of James Kirk (Gene Roddenberry's '''Star Trek''') as he wrote the novel.

==Detective fiction==
Since the narrator is within the story, he or she may not have knowledge of all the events. For this reason, first-person narrative is often used for [[detective fiction]], so that the reader and narrator uncover the case together. One traditional approach in this form of fiction is for the main detective's principal assistant, the "Watson", to be the narrator: this derives from the character of [[Doctor Watson|Dr Watson]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's]] [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.

==Forms==
First-person narratives can appear in several forms; interior monologue, as in [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Notes from Underground]]''; dramatic monologue, also in [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]''; or explicitly, as [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]].''

Other forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.

==Styles==
With a first person narrative it is important to consider how the story is being told, i.e., is the character writing it down, telling it out loud, thinking it to themselves? And if they are writing it down, is it something meant to be read by the public, a private diary, or a story meant for one other person? The way the first person narrator is relating the story will affect the language used, the length of sentences, the tone of voice and many other things. A story presented as a secret diary could be interpreted much differently than a public statement.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

First-person narratives can tend towards a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] and [[Monologue|Interior monologue]], as in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. The whole of the narrative can itself be presented as a [[false document]], such as a diary, in which the narrator makes explicit reference to the fact that he is writing or telling a story. This is the case in [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''. As a story unfolds, narrators may be aware that they are telling a story and of their reasons for telling it. The audience that they believe they are addressing can vary. In some cases, a [[frame story]] presents the narrator as a character in an outside story who begins to tell his own story, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''.

First-person narrators are often [[unreliable narrator]]s since a narrator might be impaired (such as both Quentin and Benjy in Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''), lie (as in ''[[The Quiet American]]'' by [[Graham Greene]], or ''[[The Book of the New Sun]]'' series by [[Gene Wolfe]]), or manipulate their own memories intentionally or not (as in ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'' by [[Kazuo Ishiguro]], or in [[Ken Kesey]]'s [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'']]). [[Henry James]] discusses his concerns about "the romantic privilege of the 'first person'" in his preface to ''[[The Ambassadors]]'', calling it "the darkest abyss of [[Romanticism|romance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goetz |first=William R. |title=Henry James and the Darkest Abyss of Romance |year=1986 |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |location=Baton Rouge |isbn=0-8071-1259-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=35807&amp;pageno=11 ''The Ambassadors'' (p. 11) on Project Gutenberg] Accessed 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a multi-level narrative structure is [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', which has a double framework: an unidentified "I" (first person singular) narrator relates a boating trip during which another character, Marlow, uses first person to tell a story that comprises the majority of the work. Within this nested story, it is mentioned that another character, Kurtz, told Marlow a lengthy story; however, its content is not revealed to readers. Thus, there is an "I" narrator introducing a storyteller as "he" (Marlow), who talks about himself as "I" and introduces another storyteller as "he" (Kurtz), who in turn presumably told his story from the perspective of "I".

==Film==
First person narration is more difficult to achieve in film; however, voice-over narration can create the same structure.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt;

'''Games for Change''' (also known as '''G4C''') is a movement and [[community of practice]] dedicated to using digital games for social change. It is also a sub-genre of the larger genre of [[Serious game|serious games]], along with other sub-genres such as [[Newsgame|newsgames]] and [[Educational game|educational games]]. An individual game may also be referred to as a "game for change" if it is produced by this community or shares its ideals. "Games for Change" is also the name for the non-profit organization which is building the field by providing support, visibility, and shared resources to individuals and organizations using digital games for social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gaming Wins New Advocates|url = http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/gaming-wins-new-advocates/|accessdate = 2015-09-18|publisher = The NonProfit Times|date = November 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization curates a continuously growing body of “digital and non-digital games that engage contemporary social issues in a meaningful way.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamesforchange.org/games/|title=Games For Change Games|website=www.gamesforchange.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
The game ''Sweatshop'' is an example of a past digital game curated by the Games for Change organization. Launched in 2011 by Littleloud, it is strategy game about offshore clothing manufacturing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamesforchange.org/game/sweatshop/|title=Games For Change Sweatshop|website=www.gamesforchange.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player plays the role of a factory manager responsible for hiring workers, completing store orders, and meeting the demands of clients while trying to balance ethical decisions with rising demands. The game has 30 levels that increase in difficulty and complexity, and introduce new worker types and real-world sweatshop problems such as fires, unions and the lack of toilets that add authenticity to the game mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://littleloud.com/work/sweatshop/|title=Sweatshop - Littleloud|website=littleloud.com|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game utilizes the mechanics of [[tower defense]], which have been used in many entertainment games such as ''[[Plants vs. Zombies]]''. In ''Sweatshop'', the clothing materials on the conveyor belt can be likened to “enemies”, and the factory workers who turn the materials into finished product can be seen as the defending “troops”. The use of tower defense mechanics allows the player to strategize how they will meet client demands in each level. The player must choose either to keep the workers safe and satisfied or sacrifice their well-being for factory efficiency&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, and because of these difficult decisions the game has been known for its ability to evoke guilt in players. Many players have reported their struggle to keep workers safe when trying to win more difficult levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gamechurch.com/human-dignity-and-the-bottom-line-sweatshop/|title=Human Dignity and the Bottom Line: Sweatshop|website=gamechurch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/anthropological-video-games|title=Anthropological Video Games|last=Morais|first=Betsy|date=2012-12-07|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Littleloud worked with the British charity [[Labour Behind the Label|Labour Behind The Label]] to ensure the game was factually accurate, but due to controversy over its factual approach the game was eventually removed from the Apple App store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://littleloud.com/2013/03/sweatshop-hd-no-longer-available-in-the-app-store/|title=Sweatshop HD no longer available in the App Store - Littleloud|website=littleloud.com|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''iQue, Ltd.''' ({{zh|s=神游科技|zh|t=神遊科技|p=Shényóu Kējì}}) is a Chinese–based company located in [[Suzhou]]. It was founded as a [[joint venture]] between [[Wei Yen]] and [[Nintendo]] in 2002. The following year, the company released the [[iQue Player]]. The company had since manufactured and distributed official Nintendo products for the mainland Chinese market under the iQue brand.

iQue only released portable Nintendo games for iQue [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS XL]], [[Nintendo DS|DS]], [[Game Boy Advance]], and [[Game Boy Advance SP]]. The iQue Player is the only home console available from the company in China. There were plans to release the [[Wii]] in all of China but when Satoru Iwata officially announced the release date for it on September 20, 2007, he said it would only be available in [[Hong Kong]], under the Nintendo brand. The [[Nintendo DSi]] was released in China in December 2009 as '''iQue DSi'''. The [[Nintendo 3DS XL]] was released in China as '''iQue 3DS XL''' in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ique.com/3ds/pressrelease_3dsxl.html |title="iQue 3DS XL" 今年12月发售 |publisher=Ique.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, the company became a fully owned subsidiary of Nintendo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nintendoeverything.com/up-to-date-listing-of-nintendo-subsidiaries/|title=Up-to-date listing of Nintendo subsidiaries|accessdate=2014-07-20|publisher=Nintendo Everything|date=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2013/security_q1303.pdf#page=5|title=関係会社の状況|accessdate=2014-07-20|publisher=Nintendo|date=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the company no longer brings in game consoles into Mainland China despite mainly outsourcing their manufacturing of the [[Nintendo Switch]] there, but continues to localize games in Simplified Chinese for Hong Kong. For its consoles, iQue will only offer official support.

==iQue Player==
{{Main article|iQue Player}}
The iQue Player is a micro variant of a home video game console by iQue that plays ports of Nintendo 64 games. It was uniquely designed to bypass China's ban on home console products overall at the time.

The iQue GBA is the Chinese version of the Game Boy Advance. It was released on 8 June 2004. 8 games have been released for the console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ique.com/products/M_GBA_spec.htm |title=iQue Ltd |publisher=Ique.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ique.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ique.com/games/games.htm |title=iQue Ltd |publisher=Ique.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of India}}

'''Kathakali''' ({{lang-ml|കഥകളി}}) is one of the major forms of [[classical Indian dance]].{{Sfn|Williams|2004|pp=83-84, the other nine are: Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi, Odissi, Manipuri, Cchau, Satriya, Yaksagana and Bhagavata Mela}} It is a "story play" genre of art, but one distinguished by the elaborately colorful make-up, costumes and facemasks that the traditionally male actor-dancers wear. &lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p359"/&gt;&lt;ref name="claus2003p332"/&gt;{{Refn|group=note|The gender exclusivity is one of the significant differences between Kathakali and other classical Indian dances which either included or favored female actor-dancers.&lt;ref name="Kramarae2004p295"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cheris Kramarae |author2=Dale Spender |title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAOUAgAAQBAJ |year=2004|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-96315-6 |pages=295–296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Kathakali primarily developed as a Hindu performance art in the [[Malayalam]]-speaking southwestern region of India ([[Kerala]]).&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p359"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC |year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8 |page=359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="claus2003p332"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter J. Claus|author2=Sarah Diamond|author3=Margaret Ann Mills|title=South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ienxrTPHzzwC |year=2003|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-93919-5 |pages=332–333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zarrilli17&gt;{{cite book|author=Phillip B.

Kathakali's roots are unclear. The fully developed style of Kathakali originated around the 17th century, but its roots are in the temple and folk arts (such as ''[[Kutiyattam]]'' and religious drama of the southwestern Indian peninsula), which are traceable to at least the 1st millennium [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p359"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zarrilli191&gt;{{cite book|author=Phillip B. Zarrilli|title=Kathakali Dance-drama: Where Gods and Demons Come to Play|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBNSKlcnb9kC |year=2000|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-13109-4 |pages=22–25, 191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Kathakali performance, like all classical dance arts of India, synthesizes music, vocal performers, choreography and hand and facial gestures together to express ideas. However, Kathakali differs in that it also incorporates movements from ancient Indian martial arts and athletic traditions of South India.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p359"/&gt;&lt;ref name="claus2003p332"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zarrilli17/&gt; Kathakali also differs in that the structure and details of its art form developed in the courts and theatres of Hindu principalities, unlike other classical Indian dances which primarily developed in [[Hindu temple]]s and monastic schools.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p359"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zarrilli191/&gt;

The traditional themes of the Kathakali are folk mythologies, religious legends and spiritual ideas from the Hindu epics and the [[Puranas]].&lt;ref name=zarrilli3&gt;{{cite book|author=Phillip B. Zarrilli|title=Kathakali Dance-drama: Where Gods and Demons Come to Play|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBNSKlcnb9kC |year=2000|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-13109-4 |page=3 }}, '''Quote:''' "Like most traditional modes of storytelling and performance in India, kathakali plays enact one or more episodes from regional versions of the pan-Indian religious epics (Ramayana and Mahabharata) and puranas."&lt;/ref&gt; The vocal performance has traditionally been performed in Sanskritised Malayalam.&lt;ref name=zarrilli191/&gt; In modern compositions, Indian Kathakali troupes have included women artists,&lt;ref name="Kramarae2004p295"/&gt; as well as adapted Western stories and plays such as those by Shakespeare and from Christianity.&lt;ref name=daugherty52&gt;{{cite journal | last=Daugherty | first=Diane | title=The Pendulum of Intercultural Performance: Kathakali King Lear at Shakespeare's Globe | journal=Asian Theatre Journal | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | volume=22 | issue=1 | year=2005 | pages=52–72 | doi=10.1353/atj.2005.0004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and nomenclature==

The term ''Kathakali'' is derived from ''Katha'' (Sanskrit: "कथा") which means "story, or a conversation, or a traditional tale", and ''Kali'' (from ''Kala'', "कला") which means "performance and art".&lt;ref name="James G. Lochtefeld 2002 358–359"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC |year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8 |pages=358–359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p230"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones |author2=James D. Ryan |title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC |year=2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-7564-5 |pages=230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kathakali009.jpg|thumb|right|Kathakali]]

According to Phillip Zarrilli, elements and aspects of Kathakali can be found in ancient Sanskrit texts such as the [[Natya Shastra]].&lt;ref name=zarrillinatya&gt;{{cite book|author=Phillip B. Zarrilli|title=Kathakali Dance-drama: Where Gods and Demons Come to Play|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBNSKlcnb9kC |year=2000|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-13109-4 |pages=25–29, 37, 49–56, 68, 88–94, 133–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Natya Shastra]] is attributed to sage [[Bharata Muni|Bharata]], and its first complete compilation is dated to between 200&amp;nbsp;BCE and 200&amp;nbsp;CE,{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}}{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|pp=xxiv, 19–20}} but estimates vary between 500&amp;nbsp;BCE and 500&amp;nbsp;CE.{{Sfn|Wallace Dace|1963|p=249}}

The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters.{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}}{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=1–25}} The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance ([[Shiva]]), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures – all of which are part of Indian classical dances including Kathakali.&lt;ref name=zarrillinatya/&gt;{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}}{{Sfn| Kapila Vatsyayan | 2001}} Dance and performance arts, states this ancient Hindu text,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy L. Beck|title=Sonic Liturgy: Ritual and Music in Hindu Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzUMCAAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-61117-108-2|pages=138–139 |quote='''Quote:''' "A summation of the signal importance of the Natyasastra for Hindu religion and culture has been provided by Susan Schwartz, "In short, the Natyasastra is an exhaustive encyclopedic dissertation of the arts, with an emphasis on performing arts as its central feature. It is also full of invocations to deities, acknowledging the divine origins of the arts and the central role of performance arts in achieving divine goals (...)".}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues and the essence of scriptures.&lt;ref name=mog17&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mirror of Gesture|author=Coormaraswamy and Duggirala|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1917|page=4|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924012568535#page/n5/mode/2up}}; Also see chapter 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of Kathakali are unclear. Jones and Ryan state it is more than 500 years old. According to Phillip Zarrilli, Kathakali emerged as a distinct genre of performance art during the 16th and 17th centuries in a coastal population of south India that spoke [[Malayalam]] (now [[Kerala]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Phillip B. Zarrilli|title=Kathakali Dance-drama: Where Gods and Demons Come to Play|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBNSKlcnb9kC |year=2000|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-13109-4 |pages=xi, 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of Kathakali, states Mahinder Singh, are more ancient and some 1500 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mahinder Singh|title=Kathakali|journal=Interscæna, acta scænographica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vs8-AQAAIAAJ|volume=2|year=1972|publisher=Scénografický ústav v Praze|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Links to older performance arts: Kutiyattam and Krishnanattam===

According to Farley Richmond and other scholars, Kathakali shares many elements such as costumes with ancient Indian performance arts such as ''Kutiyattam'' (classical Sanskrit drama) and medieval era ''Krishnanattam'', even though a detailed examination shows differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farley P. Richmond|author2=Darius L. Swann|author3=Phillip B. Zarrilli|title=Indian Theatre: Traditions of Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OroCOEqkVg4C|year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0981-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kutiyattam'', adds Richmond, is "one of the oldest continuously performed theatre forms in India, and it may well be the oldest surviving art form of the ancient world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farley P. Richmond|author2=Darius L. Swann|author3=Phillip B. Zarrilli|title=Indian Theatre: Traditions of Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OroCOEqkVg4C|year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0981-9|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kutiyattam'', traditionally, was performed in theatres specially designed and attached to Hindu temples, particularly dedicated to the [[Shiva]] and later to [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name=richmond95&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farley P. Richmond|author2=Darius L. Swann|author3=Phillip B. Zarrilli|title=Indian Theatre: Traditions of Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OroCOEqkVg4C|year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0981-9|pages=95–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The designs of these theatres usually matched the dimensions and architecture recommended as "ideal" in the ancient ''Natya Shastra'', and some of them could house 500 viewers.&lt;ref name=richmond95/&gt;

''Krishnanattam'' is the likely immediate precursor of Kathakali, states Zarrilli.&lt;ref name=richmond317&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farley P. Richmond|author2=Darius L. Swann|author3=Phillip B. Zarrilli|title=Indian Theatre: Traditions of Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OroCOEqkVg4C|year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0981-9|pages=317–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Krishnanattam'' is dance-drama art form about the life and activities of Hindu god [[Krishna]], that developed under the sponsorship of Sri Manavedan Raja, the ruler of Calicut (1585-1658 AD).&lt;ref name=richmond317/&gt; The traditional legend states that Kottarakkara Thampuran (also known as Vira Kerala Varma) requested the services of a ''Krishnanattam'' troupe, but his request was denied. So Kottarakkara Thampuran created another art form based on ''Krishnanattam'', called it ''Ramanattam'' because the early plays were based on the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'', which over time diversified beyond ''Ramayana'' and became popular as 'Kathakali'.&lt;ref name=richmond317/&gt;

Another related performance art is ''Ashtapadiyattom'', a dance drama based on the Gita Govinda of the twelfth-century poet [[Jayadeva]], told the story of Krishna embodied as a humble cowherd, his consort Radha, and three cow girls.{{Sfn|D. Appukuttan Nair, Ayyappa K. Paniker|1993|pp=31-34}} Kathakali also incorporates several elements from other traditional and ritualistic art forms like Mudiyettu, Teyyam and Padayani besides folk arts such as Porattunatakam that shares ideas with the Tamil ''Terukkuthu'' tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ayyappappanikkar|title=Medieval Indian Literature: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KYLpvaKJIMEC&amp;pg=PA317 |year=1997|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-0365-5 |pages=317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ananda Lal|title=The Oxford Companion to Indian Theatre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DftkAAAAMAAJ |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-564446-3 |pages=245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p331"/&gt; The south Indian martial art of ''[[Kalaripayattu|Kalarippayattu]]'' has also influenced Kathakali.&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p331"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Harding|author2=C. Rosenthal|title=The Rise of Performance Studies: Rethinking Richard Schechner's Broad Spectrum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvRZCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178 |year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-30605-9|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the links, ''Kathakali'' is different from temple-driven arts such as "Krishnanattam", ''Kutiyattam'' and others because unlike the older arts where the dancer-actor also had to be the vocal artist, ''Kathakali'' separated these roles allowing the dancer-actor to excel in and focus on choreography while the vocal artists focused on delivering their lines.&lt;ref name=richmond317/&gt; ''Kathakali'' also expanded the performance repertoire, style and standardized the costume making it easier for the audience to understand the various performances and new plays.&lt;ref name=richmond317/&gt;

==Repertoire==
''Kathakali'' is structured around plays called ''Attakatha'' (literally, "enacted story"&lt;ref name="claus2003p332"/&gt;), written in Sanskritized Malayalam.&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p331"/&gt;&lt;ref name=richmond326&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farley P. Richmond|author2=Darius L. Swann|author3=Phillip B. Zarrilli|title=Indian Theatre: Traditions of Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OroCOEqkVg4C|year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0981-9|pages=326–328}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plays are written in a particular format that helps identify the "action" and the "dialogue" parts of the performance.&lt;ref name=richmond326/&gt; The ''Shloka'' part is the metrical verse, written in third person – often entirely in Sanskrit - describing the action part of the choreography.&lt;ref name="claus2003p332"/&gt;&lt;ref name=richmond326/&gt; The ''Pada'' part contains the dialogue part.&lt;ref name=richmond326/&gt; These ''Attakatha'' texts grant considerable flexibility to the actors to improvise. Historically, all these plays were derived from Hindu texts such as the ''Ramayana'', the ''Mahabharata'' and the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kevin J. Wetmore, Jr.|author2=Siyuan Liu|author3=Erin B. Mee|title=Modern Asian Theatre and Performance 1900-2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o68AAwAAQBAJ |date=8 May 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4081-7720-4 |pages=196–197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=59}}

A ''Kathakali'' repertoire is an [[opera]]tic performance where an ancient story is playfully dramatized.&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p331"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter J. Claus|author2=Sarah Diamond|author3=Margaret Ann Mills|title=South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ienxrTPHzzwC |year=2003|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-93919-5 |pages=57, 332–333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, a Kathakali performance is long, starting at dusk and continuing through dawn, with interludes and breaks for the performers and audience.&lt;ref name="claus2003p332"/&gt; Some plays continued over several nights, starting at dusk everyday. Modern performances are shorter. The stage with seating typically in open grounds outside a temple, but in some places, special theatres called ''Kuttampalam'' built inside the temple compounds have been in use.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=49-50}}

The stage is mostly bare, or with a few drama-related items.&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p331"/&gt; One item, called a Kalivilakku (kali meaning dance; vilakku meaning lamp), can be traced back to Kuttiyattam. In both traditions, the performance happens in the front of a huge Kalivilakku with its thick wick sunk in coconut oil, burning with a yellow light.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=49-50}} Traditionally, before the advent of electricity, this special large lamp provided light during the night. As the play progressed, the actor-dancers would gather around this lamp so that audience could see what they are expressing.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=49-50}}

The performance involves actor-dancers in the front, supported by musicians in the background stage on right (audience's left) and with vocalists in the front of the stage (historically so they could be heard by the audience before the age of microphone and speakers).&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p331"/&gt;{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=49-50}}{{Refn|group=note|Modern performances with microphone and speakers sometimes position the vocalists in the back.}} Typically, all roles are played by male actor-dancers, though in modern performances, women have been welcomed into the Kathakali tradition.&lt;ref name="Kramarae2004p295"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p331"/&gt;

===Costumes===
[[File:Kathakali_DSC_0109_1.jpg|thumb|Kathakali is famed for its elaborate costumes and facial painting.]]
Of all classical Indian dances, Kathakali has the most elaborate costuming consisting of head dresses, face masks and vividly painted faces.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p230"/&gt;{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=53-56}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Janelle G.

The makeup follows an accepted code, that helps the audience easily identify the archetypical characters such as gods, goddesses, demons, demonesses, saints, animals and characters of a story.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=53}} Seven basic makeup types are used in Kathakali, namely ''Pachcha'' (green), ''Pazhuppu'' (ripe), ''Kathi''(knife), ''Kari'', ''Thaadi'', ''Minukku'' and ''Teppu''.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=53}} These vary with the styles and the predominant colours made from rice paste and vegetable colors that are applied on the face.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p230"/&gt;{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=50-58}} Pachcha (green) with lips painted brilliant coral red portrays noble characters and sages such as [[Krishna]], [[Vishnu]], [[Rama]], [[Shiva]], [[Surya]], [[Yudhishthira]], [[Arjuna]], [[Nala]] and philosopher-kings.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=53-54}}

''Tati'' (red) is the code for someone with an evil streak such as [[Ravana]], [[Dushasana]] and [[Hiranyakashipu]]. Some characters have green face (representing heroic or excellences as a warrior) with red dots or lines on their cheeks or red colored mustache or red streaked beard (representing evil inner nature), while others have full face and beard colored red, the latter implying excessively evil characters.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=54}} Kari (black) is the code for forest dwellers, hunters, and middle ground character.{{Sfn| Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=55}} Demonesses and treacherous characters are also painted black but with streaks or patches of red.{{Sfn| Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=55}}

Yellow is the code for monks, mendicants and women. ''Minukka'' (radiant, shining) with a warm yellow, orange or saffron typifies noble, virtuous feminine characters such as [[Sita]], Panchali and Mohini.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=55}} Men who act the roles of women also add a false top knot to their left and decorate it in a style common to the region.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=55}} Vella Thadi (white beard) represents a divine being, someone with virtuous inner state and consciousness such as [[Hanuman]].{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=54}} ''Teppu'' are for special characters found in Hindu mythologies, such as [[Garuda]], Jatayu and [[Hamsa (bird)|Hamsa]] who act as messengers or carriers, but do not fit the other categories.{{Sfn| Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=55}} Face masks and head gear is added to accentuate the inner nature of the characters. The garments colors have a similar community accepted code of silent communication.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=54-55}}

The character types, states Zarrilli, reflect the [[Guṇa]] theory of personalities in the ancient [[Samkhya]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]].{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=55-57}} There are three Guṇas, according to this philosophy, that have always been and continue to be present in all things and beings in the world.&lt;ref name=jamesg&gt;James G. Lochtefeld, Guna, in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Vol. 1, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3179-8}}, page 265&lt;/ref&gt; These three ''Guṇas'' are ''{{IAST|[[sattva]]}}'' (goodness, constructive, harmonious, virtuous), ''{{IAST|[[rajas]]}}'' (passion, aimless action, dynamic, egoistic), and ''{{IAST|[[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]}}'' (darkness, destructive, chaotic, viciousness). All of these three ''gunas'' (good, evil, active) are present in everyone and everything, it is the proportion that is different, according to Hindu worldview.&lt;ref name=jamesg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M Innes-Brown and S Chatterjee (1999), The Relevance of the Guna Theory in the Congruence of Eastern Values and Western Management Practice, Journal of Human Values, 5(2), pages 93-102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N Pani (2009), Hinduism, in Handbook of Economics and Ethics (Editors: Jan Peil and Irene Staveren), Edward Elgar, {{ISBN|978-1-84542-936-2}}, 216-221&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay of these ''gunas'' defines the character of someone or something,&lt;ref name=jamesg /&gt; and the costumes and face coloring in Kathakali often combines the various color codes to give complexity and depth to the actor-dancers.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=55-57}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alice Boner |title= Kathakali|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LGt1AAAAIAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Museum Rietberg (Zürich)| oclc= 603847011 |pages=36–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting===
[[File:Mani Madhava Chakyar-Sringara-new.jpg|thumb|''Sringara'', one of the nine facial expressions mentioned in Natyasastra]]
Like many classical Indian arts, Kathakali is choreography as much as it is acting. It is said to be one of the most difficult styles to execute on stage, with young artists preparing for their roles for several years before they get a chance to do it on stage. The actors speak a "[[sign language]]", where the word part of the character's dialogue are expressed through "hand signs (mudras)", while emotions and mood is expressed through "facial and eye" movements.&lt;ref name="claus2003p332"/&gt; In parallel, vocalists in the background sing rhythmically the play, matching the beats of the orchestra playing, thus unifying the ensemble into a resonant oneness.&lt;ref name="claus2003p332"/&gt;

Several ancient Sanskrit texts such as ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' and ''[[Hastha Lakshanadeepika]]'' discuss hand gestures or mudras. Kathakali follows the ''Hastha Lakshanadeepika'' most closely, unlike other classical dances of India.&lt;ref name="claus2003p332"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zarrilli17/&gt;

There are 24 main [[mudras]], and numerous more minor ones in Kathakali.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p230"/&gt;{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=73-79, 93}} There are nine facial expressions called ''[[Navarasas]]'', which each actor masters through facial muscle control during his education, in order to express the emotional state of the character in the play.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=73-79, 93}} The theory behind the ''Navarasas'' is provided by classical Sanskrit texts such as Natya Shastra, but sometimes with different names, and these are found in other classical Indian dances as well. The nine ''[[Navarasas]]'' express nine ''Bhava'' (emotions) in Kathakali as follows: ''Sringara'' expresses ''Rati'' (love, pleasure, delight), ''Hasya'' expresses ''Hasa'' (comic, laugh, mocking), ''Karuna'' expresses ''Shoka'' (pathetic, sad), ''Raudra'' expresses ''Krodha'' (anger, fury), ''Vira'' expresses ''Utsaha'' (vigor, enthusiasm, heroic), ''Bhayanaka'' expresses ''Bhaya'' (fear, concern, worry), ''Bibhatsa'' expresses ''Jugupsa'' (disgust, repulsive), ''Adbhuta'' expresses ''Vismaya'' (wondrous, marvel, curious) and ''Shanta'' expresses ''Sama'' (peace, tranquility).{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=134}}

===Sequence===
A Kathakali performance typically starts with artists tuning their instruments and warming up with beats, signaling to the arriving audience that the artists are getting ready and the preparations are on. The repertoire includes a series of performances. First comes the ''Totayam'' and ''Puruppatu'' performances, which are preliminary 'pure' (abstract) dances that emphasize skill and pure motion.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=62}} ''Totayam'' is performed behind a curtain and without all the costumes, while ''Puruppatu'' is performed without the curtain and in full costumes.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=62}}

The expressive part of the performance, which constitutes the dance-drama, is split into four tyes: ''Kalasam'' (major and most common), ''Iratti'' (special, used with battles-related ''Cempata'' rhythm),  ''Tonkaram'' (similar to ''Iratti'' but different music), and ''Nalamiratti'' (used for exits or link between the chapters of the play).{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=62}}

Entrance of characters onto the Kathakali stage can be varied. Many of these ways are not found in other major Indian classical dance traditions. Kathakali employs several methods: 1) direct without special effects or curtain; 2) through the audience, a method that engages the audience, led by torch bearers since Kathakali is typically a night performance; 3) tease and suspense called ''nokku'' or ''tirassila'' or ''tiranokku'', where the character is slowly revealed by the use of a curtain.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=166}} The "tease" method is typically used for characters with hidden, dangerous intentions.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=166}}

==Songs and musical instruments==
{{multiple image

 }}
The play is in the form of verses that are metered and lyrical, sung by vocalists whose voice has been trained to various melodies (''raga''), music and synchronized with the dance-acting on the stage.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=58-60}} The vocalists not only deliver the lines, but help set the context and express the inner state of the character by modulating their voice. For example, anger is expressed by the use of sharp high voice and pleading is expressed by the use of a tired tone.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=61}}

Music is central to a Kathakali performance. It sets the mood and triggers emotions resonant with the nature of the scene.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=61}} It also sets the rhythm to which the actor-dancers perform the choreography and scenes. Some major musical patterns, according to Clifford and Betty, that go with the moods and content of the scene are: ''Cempata'' (most common and default that applies to a range of moods, in battles and fights between good and evil, also to conclude a scene); ''Campa'' music (depict tension, dispute, disagreement between lovers or competing ideas); ''Pancari'' (for odious, preparatory such as sharpening a sword); ''Triputa'' (thought provoking, scenes involving sages and teachers); ''Atanta'' (scenes involving kings or divine beings); ''Muri Atanta'' musical style (for comic, light hearted, or fast moving scenes involving heroic or anger-driven activity).{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=61}}

Many musical instruments are used in Kathakali. Three major drums found are ''Maddalam'' (barrel shaped), ''Centa'' (cylindrical drum played with curved sticks) and ''Itaykka'' (''Idakka'', hourglass shaped drum with muted and melodious notes played when female characters perform).{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=58}}

==Traditional plays==
{{Further information|Aattakatha (performance)}}
Over five hundred Kathakali plays (''[[Aattakatha (performance)|Aattakatha]]'') exist, most of which were written before the 20th century.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=59-60}} Of these, about four dozen are most actively performed.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=60}} These plays are sophisticated literary works, states Zarrilli, and only five authors have written more than two plays.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=60}} The late 17th century [[Unnayi Variyar]], in his short life, produced four plays which are traditionally considered the most expressive of the Kathakali [[playwright]]s. Typically, his four plays are performed on four nights, and they relate to the mythical Hindu love story of [[Nala]] and [[Damayanti]].{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=60}} The Nala-Damanyanti story has roots in the texts of 1st millennium BCE, and is found in the Mahabharata, but the Kathakali play version develops the characters, their inner states, the emotions and their circumstances far more than the older texts.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=60}}

A tradition Kathakali play typically consists of two interconnected parts, the third-person ''Shlokas'' and first-person ''Padams''. The ''Shlokas'' are in Sanskrit and describe the action in the scene, while ''Padams'' are dialogues in Malayalam (Sanskritized) for the actors to interpret and play.&lt;ref name="claus2003p332"/&gt; A ''Padam'' consists of three parts: a ''[[Pallavi]]'' (refrain), ''[[Anupallavi]]'' (subrefrain) and ''[[Charanam|Caranam]]'' (foot), all of which are set to one of the ancient ''[[Raga|Ragas]]'' ([[Mode (music)|musical mode]]), based on the mood and context as outlined in ancient Sanskrit texts such as the ''Natya Shastra''.&lt;ref name="claus2003p332"/&gt;{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=41-44}} In historic practice of a play performance, each ''Padam'' was enacted twice by the actor while the vocalists sang the lines repeatedly as the actor-dancer played his role out.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=41-44}}

The traditional plays were long, many written to be performed all night, some such as those based on the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' written to be performed for many sequential nights. However, others such as the ''Prahlada Caritam'' have been composed so that they can be performed within four hours.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=61}} Modern productions have extracted parts of these legendary plays, to be typically performed within 3 to 4 hours.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=61-62}}

===Offshoots and modern adaptations===
In modern days, Kathakali artists have been producing new plays based on not only traditional Hindu mythologies, but also European classics and Shakespeare's plays. Recent productions have adapted stories from other cultures and mythologies, such as those of [[Christianity]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elnortedecastilla.es/culturas/201607/25/quijote-medio-camino-entre-20160721111257.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref name=daugherty52/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farley P.

==Styles: Sampradayam ==
Kathakali has lineages or distinctive schools of play interpretation and dance performance called ''Sampradayam''. These developed in part because of the [[Gurukula|Gurukul]] system of its transmission from one generation to the next.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=26-27}} By the 19th-century, many such styles were in vogue in Malayalam speaking communities of South India, of which two major styles have crystallized and survived into the modern age.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=26-27}}{{Sfn|D. Appukuttan Nair, Ayyappa K. Paniker|1993|pp=35-38}}

The ''Kidangoor'' style is one of the two, that developed in [[Travancore]], and it is strongly influenced by ''Kutiyattam'', while also drawing elements of ''Ramanattam'' and ''Kalladikkotan''.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=26}} It is traditionally attributed to Nalanunni, under the patronage of Utram Tirunal Maharaja (1815-1861).{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=26}}

The ''Kalluvayi'' style is second of the two, which developed in [[Palakkad]] (Olappamanna Mana) in central Kerala, and it is a synthesis of the older ''Kaplingadan'' and ''Kalladikkotan'' performance arts.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=26-27}}{{Sfn|D. Appukuttan Nair, Ayyappa K. Paniker|1993|pp=35-38}} It is traditionally attributed to Unniri Panikkar, in a [[Brahmin]] household (~1850), and became the dominant style established in [[Kerala Kalamandalam]] – a school of performance arts.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=26-27}}

==Training centers and awards==

A typical Kathakali training center auditions for students, examining health and physical fitness necessary for the aerobic and active stage performance, the body flexibility, sense of rhythm and an interview to gauge how sincere the student is in performance arts.&lt;ref name=richmond320&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farley P.

Kathakali is still hugely male-dominated, but since the 1970s, women have made entry into the art form on a recognisable scale. The central Kerala temple town of [[Tripunithura]] has a ladies' troupe (with members belonging to several parts of the state) who perform Kathakali, by and large in [[Travancore]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The theory and foundations of ''Kathakali'' are same as other major classical Indian dances, traceable to Sanskrit texts such as the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', but the expression style in each is very different and distinctive.&lt;ref name="Kramarae2004p295"/&gt; ''Kathakali'' is different from a similar-sounding ''[[Kathak]]'', though both are Indian classical dance traditions of "story play" wherein the stories have been traditionally derived from the Hindu epics and the Puranas. Kathak is an ancient performance art that emerged in North India, with roots in traveling bards retelling mythical and spiritual stories through dance-acting.&lt;ref name="James G. Lochtefeld 2002 358–359"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Banham|title=The Cambridge Guide to Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qMTPAPFGXUC|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43437-9|pages=522–525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathak traditionally has included female actor-dancers, unlike Kathakali which has traditionally been performed by an all-male troupe.&lt;ref name="claus2003p332"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cheris Kramarae|author2=Dale Spender|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAOUAgAAQBAJ |year=2004|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-96315-6|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathak deploys much simpler costumes, makeup and no face masks. Both dance forms employ choreography, face and hand gestures traceable to the ''Natya Shastra'', but ''Kathak'' generally moves around a straight leg and torso movements, with no martial art leaps and jumps like Kathakali. Kathak uses the stage space more, and does not typically include separate vocalists. Both deploy a host of similar traditional Indian musical instruments.&lt;ref name="claus2003p332"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruno Nettl|author2=Ruth M.

Kathakali-style, costume rich, musical drama are found in other cultures. For example, the Japanese ''[[Noh]]'' (能) integrates masks, costumes and various props in a dance-based performance, requiring highly trained actors and musicians. Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized gestures while the costumes communicate the nature of the characters in a ''Noh'' performance, as in Kathakali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric C.

'''Laughter in animals''' other than [[human]]s describes [[ethology|animal behavior]] which resembles human [[laughter]].

Several non-human species demonstrate [[Emotion in animals#Vocalisations|vocalizations]] that sound similar to human laughter. A significant proportion of these species are mammals, which suggests that the neurological functions occurred early in the process of mammalian evolution.&lt;ref name="Panksepp2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Panksepp, J.|title=The riddle of laughter neural and psychoevolutionary underpinnings of joy|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2000|volume=9|issue=6|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00090|pages=183–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apes==
[[Chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[bonobo]]s and [[orangutans]] show laughter-like vocalizations in response to physical contact such as wrestling, play chasing or [[Tickling#Physiology|tickling]]. This behavior is documented in wild and captive chimpanzees. [[Chimpanzee#Laughter in apes|Chimpanzee laughter]] is not readily recognizable to humans as such, because it is generated by alternating inhalations and exhalations that sound more like breathing and panting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090604-apes-laugh-tickle-chimps-gorillas.html|title=Apes Laugh, Tickle Study Finds|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It sounds similar to screeching. The differences between chimpanzee and human laughter may be the result of adaptations that have evolved to enable human speech. One study{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} analyzed sounds made by human babies and bonobos when tickled. It found that although the bonobo’s laugh was a higher frequency, the laugh followed the same sonographic pattern of human babies to include as similar facial expressions. Humans and chimpanzees share similar ticklish areas of the body such as the armpits and belly.

Research has noted the similarity in forms of laughter among humans and apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans) when tickled, suggesting that laughter derived from a common origin among primate species, and therefore [[evolution|evolved]] prior to the origin of humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8083230.stm "Tickled apes yield laughter clue"], BBC, June 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2009.05.028 | volume=19 | title=Reconstructing the Evolution of Laughter in Great Apes and Humans | journal=Current Biology | pages=1106–1111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rats==
[[Image:Rattus norvegicus 1.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Brown rats emit 50-kHz calls during rough and tumble play, and when tickled.]]
[[Rat]]s emit long, 50-kHz [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] calls that are induced during rough and tumble play, and when tickled by humans. The vocalization is described as distinct "chirping".  Like humans, rats have "tickle skin", areas of the body that generate greater laughter responses than others. Rats that laugh the most also play the most and prefer to spend more time with other laughing rats.  It has been reported that there is no decline in the tendency to laugh and respond to tickle skin as rats age, however, it has also been reported that in females, brain maturation after puberty appears to redefine tickling as aversive, leading to avoidance rather than appetitive responses.&lt;ref name="Paredes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paredes-Ramos|first1=P.|last2=Miquel|first2=M.|last3=Manzo|first3=J.|last4=Pfaus|first4=J.G.|last5=López-Meraz|first5=M.L.|last6=Coria-Avila|first6=G.A.|year=2012|title=Tickling in juvenile but not adult female rats conditions sexual partner preference|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=107|issue=1|pages=17–25|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.05.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies show that rats chirp when wrestling one another, before receiving morphine, or when mating.  The sound has been interpreted as an expectation of something rewarding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20010728/fob9.asp Science News 2001 - requires signup]&lt;/ref&gt; High frequency ultrasonic vocalizations are important in rat communication and function to elicit approach behavior in the recipient.&lt;ref name="Wohr"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wöhr|first1=M.|last2=Schwarting|first2=R.K.|year=2007|title=Ultrasonic communication in rats: Can playback of 50-kHz calls induce approach behavior?|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=2|issue=12|pages=e1365|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001365|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial goal of research by [[Jaak Panksepp]] and Jeff Burgdorf was to track the biological origins of how the brain processes emotions and social behavior.  They compared rat vocalizations during social interactions to the joy and laughter commonly experienced by children in social play. They concluded that the 50-kHz rat vocalizations might reflect positive [[Affect (psychology)|affective state]]s (feelings or emotions), analogous to those experienced by children laughing during social play.&lt;ref name="Panksepp2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panksepp|first1=J.|last2=Burgdorf|first2=J.|year=2003|title="Laughing" rats and the evolutionary antecedents of human joy?|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=79|issue=3|pages=533–547|url=http://caspar.bgsu.edu/~courses/Reading/Papers/2003PanBur.pdf|doi=10.1016/s0031-9384(03)00159-8|pmid=12954448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent studies have investigated the emotional states of rats after being tickled.  An animal's optimism or pessimism can be assessed by [[Cognitive bias in animals|cognitive bias]] studies. After being tickled, rats are more optimistic, indicating the interaction invokes a positive affective state.&lt;ref name="Rygula"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rygula|first1=R.|last2=Pluta|first2=H.|last3=Popik|first3=P.|year=2012|title=Laughing rats are optimistic|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=12|pages=e51959|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051959|pmid=23300582|pmc=3530570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, rats self-administer playback of the 50-kHz trill calls and avoid playback of 22-kHz calls.&lt;ref name="Burgdorf"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgdorf|first1=J.|last2=Kroes|first2=R.A.|last3=Moskal|first3=J.R.|last4=Pfaus|first4=J.G.|last5=Brudzynski|first5=S.M.|last6=Panksepp|first6=J.|year=2008|title=Ultrasonic vocalizations of rats (Rattus norvegicus) during mating, play, and aggression: Behavioral concomitants, relationship to reward, and self-administration of playback|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=122|issue=4|pages=357–367|doi=10.1037/a0012889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When rats are given [[naloxone]] (an [[opioid]] antagonist), tickling no longer evokes the 50-kHz vocalisation which indicates that the rewarding properties of tickling are modulated by endogenous opioids.

==Dogs==
[[Dog]]s sometimes pant in a manner that sounds like a human laugh. By analyzing the pant using a [[sonograph]], this pant varies with bursts of frequencies. When this vocalization is played to dogs in a shelter setting, it can initiate play, promote pro-social behavior, and decrease stress levels.  One study compared the behaviour of 120 dogs with and without exposure to a recorded "dog-laugh".  Playback reduced stress-related behaviors, increased tail wagging, the display of a "play-face" when playing was initiated, and pro-social behavior such as approaching and lip licking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Simonet, P.|author2=Versteeg, D.|author3=Storie, D.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2005|title=Dog-laughter: Recorded playback reduces stress related behavior in shelter dogs|journal=Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Environmental Enrichment|url=http://www.petalk.org/LaughingDog.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dolphins==
In 2004, researchers who were studying dolphins in Sweden noticed a particular set of sounds that they hadn't heard before.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dolphincommunicationproject.org/pdf/MS-IV-BlomqvistC-041121.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These sounds consisted of a short burst of pulses, followed by a whistle. After further observations the researchers discovered that these signals were only being made by dolphins during play-fighting, and never during aggressive confrontations. Their conclusion was that these sounds were being made by the dolphins to indicate that the situation was pleasant and/or non-threatening, and to help prevent it escalating into something like a real fight. This, according to psychologists, is the reason why laughter exists in the first place, suggesting these noises were the dolphin equivalent of a human laugh.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/nov/17/tickling-rats-giggling-dolphins-do-animals-sense-humour&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lupino Lane''' (16 June 1892 – 10 November 1959) was an English actor and [[Actor-manager|theatre manager]], and a member of the famous [[Lupino family]], which eventually included his niece, the screenwriter/director/actress [[Ida Lupino]]. Lane started out as a child performer, known as 'Little Nipper', and went on to appear in a wide range of theatrical, [[music hall]] and film performances. He is best known for playing Bill Snibson in the play and film ''[[Me and My Girl]]'', which popularised the song and dance routine "[[The Lambeth Walk]]".&lt;ref name="odb"&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Biography'' "Lupino Lane"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Lane was born '''Henry William George Lupino''', in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], London, son of Harry Charles Lupino (1867–1925), part of the [[Lupino family]]. He adopted the surname Lane from his great-aunt Sarah Lane (1822–1899, née Borrow), the director of the [[Britannia Theatre]], [[Hoxton]].&lt;ref name="odb" /&gt;  Lane married actress Violet Blythe on 10 February 1917, and their son was the actor Lauri Lupino Lane (1921–86).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/383/000134978/ NNDB "Lupino Lane"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Lane's brother was the actor [[Wallace Lupino]], and his nephew, Wallace's son, was another actor, [[Richard Lupino]].

Lane made his first stage appearance at the age of four in a benefit in [[Birmingham]] for [[Vesta Tilley]]. He made his London début in 1903 as Nipper Lane at the [[London Pavilion]].&lt;ref name="odb" /&gt;  He worked steadily as a performer thereafter. In 1915, he appeared at the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Theatre]] and played comic roles in theatre and film on both sides of the Atlantic from then on. In 1921, he dived through sixty three stage traps in six minutes while performing in a 1921 [[pantomime]] production of ''[[Aladdin]]'' at the Hippodrome.&lt;ref name="odb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Graphic'', 8 January 1921&lt;/ref&gt; Lane and his wife Violet Blythe were both in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of the musical ''[[Afgar]]'', at the Central Theatre, in 1920–21, and he appeared in the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]] of 1924'' at the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]], from June 1924 to March 1925, and subsequently played Ko-Ko in ''[[The Mikado]]'' on Broadway in 1925, receiving good reviews.&lt;ref name="odb" /&gt;

Lane's silent film career started in 1915 in a series of British short films, including the experimental ''Mr Butterbuns'' series. As a comedy actor, he appeared in 40 [[Hollywood]] films made in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="odb" /&gt;  After several shorts and features for Fox in 1922–23, Lane appeared as Rudolph in [[D. W. Griffith]]'s 1924 feature ''[[Isn't Life Wonderful|Isn't Life Wonderful?]].'' He signed with [[Educational Pictures]] for a series of short comedies that featured his acrobatic flips and falls.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[Roscoe Arbuckle]] was one of his directors, but Lane was soon directing the films himself under the pseudonym "Henry W. George" (his given names). These comedies displayed Lane's agility and versatility: in one film he played 24 characters (''Only Me'', 1929).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Lane's brother Wallace Lupino, who usually co-starred in Lane's comedies, also starred in his own comedies, of which only three are known to survive. (Archivist Ben Model discovered one of them and posted it on YouTube.)

Lupino Lane made the transition to talking pictures, starring in a few sound shorts for Educational and making a guest appearance in the [[Warner Bros.]] feature ''[[The Show of Shows]]''. He also played a major role in the 1929 musical film ''[[The Love Parade]]'', but within two years he left Hollywood for his native England.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== 1930s ==
In the 1930s, Lane directed and acted in mostly British feature films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  With Sir [[Oswald Stoll]], Lane co-produced ''[[Twenty to One]]'', written by L. Arthur Rose and [[Frank Eyton]] with music by [[Billy Mayerl]], on the [[West End theatre|West End]]. Lane made his first appearance as Bill Snibson in this production, in which Snibson, a [[tout]], was a big hit. The production ran for a year starting from November 1935 and went on a long British tour after that.&lt;ref name="odb" /&gt;

''[[Me and My Girl]]'', the follow-up show, written by Rose and [[Douglas Furber]] with music by [[Noel Gay]], was an even bigger hit. Snibson inherits a country estate and invites his mates from [[Lambeth]] to stay with him. It featured a hit song and dance routine from Lane called "[[The Lambeth Walk]]", which became popular throughout Europe in the late 1930s. Lane directed and produced the show as well as starring in it for 1,550 performances between 1937 and 1940.&lt;ref name="British Cinema page 109"&gt;Jeffrey Richards editor ''The Unknown 1930s: An Alternative History of the British Cinema, 1929–1939'' I. B. Tauris, 1991, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first British musical comedy to be televised and was made into a film in 1939.&lt;ref name="odb" /&gt;  The film was known as ''Lambeth Walk''{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} due to the popularity of the dance.&lt;ref name="British Cinema page 109"/&gt;

== Later career and death ==
The success of ''Me and My Girl'' made Lane a rich man. Lane continued to act on stage and on television in England for the rest of his life.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In 1946, after it sustained damage during [[World War II]], he purchased the shell of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in London to rescue it from dereliction, intending to produce comedies.  He failed to win the financial backing to refurbish it and sold it in 1950. The theatre was demolished in 1956.
It is thought that at the time, he desired to commit lascivious acts against his clerk, Maria Reinhoff, as he is quaoted as saying, "I want to pull down her skirt and violently copulate."

He was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in March 1956 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at London's BBC Television Theatre.   He also appeared as the castaway on [[Desert Island Discs]] in 1957.

Lane died on 10 November 1959, in London, at age 67.&lt;ref name="odb" /&gt;
He is buried at [[Streatham Park Cemetery]]. His wife, Violet Blythe, died 17 March 1983, aged 93.

To mark the 50th anniversary of his death, [[the Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America]] restored his memorial at Streatham Park Cemetery and held a memorial service at [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's]], [[Covent Garden]], with a reception at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Stage'' newspaper, 5 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A commemorative [[blue plaque]] was erected to Lupino Lane on 15 June 2014 at his former home 32 [[Maida Vale]], Paddington, by [[The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themusichallguild.com/news.php |title=Music Hall Guild |publisher=Music Hall Guild |date=2011-09-25 |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MBC 2''' is an [[United Arab Emirates|Emirati]] [[free-to-air]] movie channel launched on January 12, 2003. On its debut, it broadcast [[film|movies]] and [[television program]]mes [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitled]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but after the launch of [[MBC 4 (Middle East)|MBC 4]] the channel specialised in movies only. The channel is based in [[Dubai Media City]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and is owned by the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] broadcaster [[Middle East Broadcasting Center|MBC Group]].
The channel mostly broadcasts American [[Hollywood]] movies but it also seldom features British, Canadian, French, Indian,  Chinese and other foreign films. MBC 2 has managed to negotiate long-term deals with the top Hollywood studios, securing first-run right and ensuring a steady flow of the top [[box-office]] movies. 

MBC 2 has secured a deal to show 32 Indian movies after its initial broadcast of ''[[Jodhaa Akbar]]'', which was a huge success and was appreciated by the public as well as the advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/565934-mbc-signs-deal-to-show-32-indian-movies MBC signs deal to show 32 Indian movies]&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, ended up on [[MBC Max]] instead, due to tying in the Bollywood films as part of the dubbed films package so that these films can be watched by the Arab audience as well.

The channel largely targets the Arabic audience, especially young adults, and it has an important popularity among [[Arab]] viewers.

MBC2 HD launched in July 1st, 2011.

Subsequently, this version was released to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='De Avonturen van Kleine Muis' Dutch distribution|url=https://www.bol.com/nl/p/de-avonturen-van-kleine-muis-dl-1/1002004000080289/?country=BE|website=Bol.com|language=dutch|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie consists of eight episodes of the 1976 Polish [[animation]] television series ''[[Margo the Mouse]]''.

==Plot==

The movie is a selection of several episodes of the original television series ''Margo the Mouse'' and it has no dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Przygody Myszki at Polish Films database|url=http://www.filmpolski.pl/fp/index.php?film=423155|website=FilmPolski|language=polish|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film narrates the life of the beloved Margo, a little mouse that she lives in a tree located in a beautiful countryside. Other animals live in the tree, which are her neighbors. There's Eliana, a nice squirrel that lives on the top floor or Dennis, a dormouse that lives in the back of the tree. Margo will live incredible adventures in her day to day. It will not be easy experiences for Margo, since the little mouse will also have to face fearsome creatures like a giant fish, an evil stork or a sullen cat. Thanks to her intelligence and her friends, Margo will learn a life lesson in each moment that will help her grow and mature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Margo the Mouse plot summary|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7506236/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl|website=IMDB|language=english|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between her experiences she will be helping her friend Eliana when she must go to take care of her sick mother, since an owl will invade the floor of the squirrel at night. Thanks to her intelligence and the help of a technical mole, Margo will be able to face the fearsome owl, which has caused all the neighbors to flee from the tree of the field. Another of her experiences will be to face a vagabond rat that he wants to throw her out of her own home. Without knowing anything, the tramp will hang around Margo's house to enter, throw her out and live at her expense. The vagabond will draw a plan to cause Margo to leave. In his plan, the vagabond will cause the chimney of the tree to spoil, as well as try to scare Margo during the night, as well as to scare the little mouse by putting a robot in the shape of a cat in her house. However, she is very intelligent and brave and does not get scared easily. When Margo leaves her house to visit some friends, the tramp will create a trap to expel the mouse from her house. However, the vagabond's ambition will be excessive and that will cause him to fall into his own trap.

Not everything will be bad experiences for Margo. In a sequence, Margo will visit her lovely Aunt Adelina to celebrate her birthday. During the journey, the little mouse will meet Jurand, a bitter beaver who will be very rude to her and her aunt. Margo and Adelina will teach him that he should be kinder to people, otherwise he will be left alone. In another moment, Margo and her friend Anna, a sparrow, will have to face an evil cat that he will want to eat them. One day, Margo invited her friend Anna to have tea at her house and then weave a tapestry with the melodies that Anna sang. Her pleasant song reaches the ears of the bad cat that he will want to eat the mouse and the sparrow. The cat will try to break the windows of Margo's house, also create holes to enter, but the intelligence and rapidity of the two friends will make their plans fail. However, when the cat decides to flood Margo's house with water, she decides to take out her gramophone and put a disc with barking dog sounds to scare the bad cat away.

Among her other adventures will be to defeat a terrifying stork that wants to eat it or face the owl that lives in an old castle. Thanks to her intelligence and the strong friendship she has with other characters, Margo will learn to live and mature at every moment.

Years later, in 2007, the film was part of the [[Ghibli Museum Library]], the selection of television series, short films and international feature films that the prestigious Japanese animation studio, [[Studio Ghibli]], distributes in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=López|first1=Álvaro|title=Biografía de Studio Ghibli|url=http://centrodeartigos.com/revista-digital-educacion-tecnologia-educativa/contenido-18497.html|website=Centro de Ártigos|language=spanish|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==

In the 80s, ''Margo the Mouse'' was sold for international distribution. In most of the countries where the film was released it went directly to video. In the former Soviet Union and in Poland it had a limited release in cinemas, in Poland it was distributed by Film Polski. The film was available in domestic distribution in several countries of the world in the 80s and 90s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Margo the Mouse Release Info|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7506236/releaseinfo?ref_=ttfc_ql_2|website=IMDB|language=english|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Main protagonist, the little Mouse Myszka, was titled with differente names as Jeannette, Tina or Margo, her internacional and official name. Something similar happened with ''[[Ciné si]]'', the animated TV series by French director [[Michel Ocelot]], who later premiered some fragments as a package-film called ''[[Princes et princesses|Princes and Princesses]]''. In Spain, the compilation movie was released in 1990.

In the early 2000s, the television series began to be distributed instead of the movie. For example, in Spain, ''Margo the Mouse'' TV series was broadcast on regional television channels in 2001. In France, the Netherlands and Switzerland, the television series was released on DVD in the early 2000s, as did the UK and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='De Avonturen van Kleine Muis' Dutch distribution|url=https://www.bol.com/nl/p/de-avonturen-van-kleine-muis-dl-1/1002004000080289/?country=BE|website=Bol.com|language=dutch|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In United Kingdom, ''Margo the Mouse'' was released by GM Distribution with English subtitles. In United States and Canada, ''Margo the Mouse'' was distributed by Facets Video with name ''The Adventures of Little Mouse'' although series is titled ''Margo the Mouse'' was aired on [[PBS]] in the United States. Along with the DVD distribution of the original animation series, the film was also edited as an extra edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zawodów|first1=Tury|title=Przygody Myszki in the world|url=http://info.wyborcza.pl/temat/wyborcza/tury+zawod%C3%B3w|website=Gazeta Weborcza|language=polish|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last release of the film was in 2007, when in Japan the Margo the Mouse film was chosen for distribution on DVD as part of the [[Ghibli Museum Library]] and was distributed by [[Studio Ghibli]] in collaboration with [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]].

[[File:Mind-reading-Russell-Morgan.jpeg|thumb|Theatrical poster for a mind-reading performance, 1900]]
'''Mentalism''' is a performing art in which its practitioners, known as '''mentalists''', appear to demonstrate highly developed mental or intuitive abilities. Performances may appear to include [[hypnosis]], [[telepathy]], [[clairvoyance]], [[divination]], [[precognition]], [[psychokinesis]], [[mediumship]], [[mind control]], memory feats, deduction, and rapid mathematics. Mentalists are sometimes categorized as [[psychic]] entertainers, although that category also contains non-mentalist performers such as psychic readers and [[Bizarre magic|bizzarists]].

==Background==
Much of what modern mentalists perform in their acts can be traced back directly to "tests" of supernatural power that were carried out by mediums, [[spiritualist]]s, and [[psychic]]s in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Bob: "Fundamentals of Professional Mentalism". Lybrary, 2007. pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the history of mentalism goes back even further. Accounts of [[Clairvoyance|seer]]s and [[oracle]]s can be found in works by the [[ancient Greeks]]{{Attribution needed|date=September 2011}} and in the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]]. Among magicians, the mentalism performance generally cited as one of the earliest on record was by diplomat and pioneering [[sleight of hand|sleight-of-hand]] magician [[Girolamo Scotto]] in 1572.  The performance of mentalism may utilize these principles along with sleights, feints, [[Misdirection (magic)|misdirection]], and other skills of street or [[magic (illusion)|stage magic]].&lt;ref name=EncycClaims&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/mentalist.html | title=An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=1995 | first=James | last=Randi | accessdate = 2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance approaches==
Styles of presentation can vary greatly. Traditional performers such as [[Dunninger]] and [[Theodore Annemann|Annemann]] attributed their results to supernatural or psychic skills.

Some contemporary performers, such as [[Derren Brown]], attribute their results to natural skills, such as the ability to read [[body language]] or to manipulate the subject subliminally through psychological suggestion.

Others, including [[Chan Canasta]] and [[David Berglas]] would make no specific claims but leave it up to the audience to decide.

Contemporary mentalists often take their shows onto the streets and perform tricks to a live, unsuspecting audience. They do this by approaching random members of the public and ask to demonstrate their supernatural powers. Performers such as [[Derren Brown]] who often adopt this method of performance tell their audience before the trick starts that everything they see is an illusion and that they are not really "having their mind read." This has been the cause of a lot of controversy in the sphere of magic as some mentalists want their audience to believe that this type of magic is 'real' whilst others think that it is morally wrong to lie to a spectator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sorcerers-apprentice.co.uk/karma.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426185334/http://www.sorcerers-apprentice.co.uk/karma.htm |archivedate=2015-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mentalist or magician==
Mentalists generally do not mix "standard" magic tricks with their mental feats. Doing so associates mentalism too closely with the theatrical trickery employed by stage magicians. Many mentalists claim not to be magicians at all, arguing that it is a different art form altogether. The argument is that mentalism invokes belief and when presented properly, is offered as being "real" be it a claim of psychic ability, or proof that supports other claims such as a photographic memory, being a "human calculator", the power of suggestion, [[Neuro-linguistic programming|NLP]], etc.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  Mentalism plays on the senses and a spectator's perception of tricks.

Magicians ask the audience to suspend their disbelief and allow their imagination to play with the various tricks they present. They admit that they are tricksters and entertainers, and know the audience understands it's an illusion and the magician cannot really achieve the impossible feats shown, such as sawing a person in half and putting them back together without injury.

However, many magicians mix mentally-themed performance with magic illusions. For example, a mind-reading stunt might also involve the magical transposition of two different objects. Such hybrid feats of [[Stage magic|magic]] are often called ''mental magic'' by performers. Magicians who routinely mix magic with mental magic include [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[David Blaine]], [[The Amazing Kreskin]], and [[Dynamo (magician)|Dynamo]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.  Notable mentalists who mix magic with mentalism include [[The Amazing Kreskin]], [[Richard Osterlind]], [[David Berglas]], [[Derren Brown]], and [[Joseph Dunninger]].

'''Music Theatre Wales''' (MTW) is a touring [[contemporary opera]] company, based in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. MTW performs newly commissioned works, alongside existing pieces from the recent past which are either neglected or have been unseen in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Works are toured across the UK and internationally. Over its 22-year history MTW has performed almost 30 productions and 14 world premieres.

In 2002 it became the first Associate Company of the [[Royal Opera House]].

== History ==
Founded in 1988 by Artistic Directors [[Michael McCarthy (opera director)|Michael McCarthy]] and [[Michael Rafferty (conductor)|Michael Rafferty]], Music Theatre Wales was created from the merger of two previous companies - both formed in [[south Wales]] in 1982 - [[Cardiff New Opera Group]] and [[St Donats Music Theatre Ensemble]].

At that time both organisations had identified a gap in the provision of [[opera]] in Wales. Though [[Welsh National Opera]] had achieved great success in exploring lesser known areas of the repertoire and had established itself as the leading, innovative [[opera company]] of the UK, there was very little commitment to new work. Audience and critical response to the work of Cardiff New Opera Group in particular demonstrated that there was indeed a hunger for new opera and a demand to see it tour in Wales.

Initially the repertoire was selected from works that already existed but which deserved wider exposure. Fundamentally, the repertoire was inspired by the work of [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] and his own company, [[The Fires of London]]. The first MTW production was a setting of Peter Maxwell Davies’ [[The Martyrdom of St Magnus]] in the graveyard of the Saxon church in the grounds of [[St Donat's Castle]]. The production was then adapted for touring in Wales and later re-worked into a production for [[Glasgow]] [[European City of Culture]] 1990, playing at [[the Tramway]], and at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]], [[London]] in collaboration with the [[Scottish Chamber Orchestra]]. This was followed by the European premiere of [[Philip Glass]]'s The Fall of the House of Usher which toured in Wales and [[England]], establishing en route many long-term relationships with venues and festivals, and led to the company’s first international collaboration when it was presented in [[Norway]] as the first production of [[Opera Vest]] (recently re-formed as [[Den Nye Opera]]–Norway’s second main-scale opera company presenting a mixed programme of new and established repertoire).

Since 1988 MTW has created almost 30 productions and presented 14 world premieres. It has an established programme to help nurture new opera [[composer]]s and has created productions with a wide range of partners including [[Opéra national du Rhin]] in [[Strasbourg]], the [[Berlin Festival]], Opera Vest in Norway, [[Banff Centre]] in [[Canada]], [[Theatr Brycheiniog]] in [[Brecon]], [[Haarlem Theatre]] in the [[Netherlands]], [[Treffpunkt]] in [[Stuttgart]], and the Royal Opera House, [[Covent Garden]]. MTW has been recorded on CD, broadcast on BBC radio, and one production has been re-created and screened on BBC2. The company has twice been short-listed for the [[Prudential Awards]] for “creativity, excellence, innovation and accessibility.” The opera [[Gwyneth and the Green Knight]] by [[Lynne Plowman]], produced by MTW in 2002 and later as a co-production with ROH2 was the first opera to win the [[British Composers Award]] and Lynne Plowman’s second opera commissioned by MTW, [[The House of the Gods]], was also shortlisted for this award in 2007. In 2009, the company worked for the first time in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], commissioning a new performing version of [[The Soldier's Tale]]–Stori’r Milwr. 2010 sees the [[Signum Records]] release of a CD of [[Michael Berkeley]]’s opera [[For You (opera)|For You]] and the UK premiere tour of [[In the Penal Colony]] by Philip Glass. In 2013 MTW gave the UK premiere of [[Salvatore Sciarrino]]'s ''[[Luci mie traditrici]]'', in an English translation with the title 'The Killing Flower'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8197">A '''narrative network''' is a system which represents complex event sequences or characters’ interactions as depicted by a [[narrative]] text. [[Network science]] methodology offers an alternative way of analysing the patterns of relationships, composition and activities of events and actors studied in their own context. [[Network theory]] can contribute to the understanding of the structural properties of a text and the data contained in it. The meaning of the individual and the community in a narrative is conditional on their position in a system of social relationships reported by the [[author]]. Hence, a central problem when dealing with narratives is framing and organising the author’s perspective of individual and collective connections in order to understand better the role of both the witness (viz. the [[persona]] that emerges from the narrative)&lt;ref&gt;"Voice", Gérard Genette remarked, in ''Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Methods'' (Cornell University Press: 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; and its testimony as reflected by the text.  However, the category of narrative network is in its formative, initial phase and as a consequence it is hard to view as a stable and defined notion in [[linguistics]], and beyond [[sociology]].

==Overview: Narrative as a structure of a story in time==

In order to be an object of study and analysis, time has to be transformed into a causal sequence, and the only way in which this can be done is by narration.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Munz, “The historical narrative,” in Companion to Historiography, ed. M. Bentley (London: Routledge, 1997), 870.&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of description, narrating inevitably requires sequencing in time. The direction of time is not a trivial thing, but the backbone of the information contained in the narrative itself. One has to bear in mind the fundamental concepts of [[Gérard Genette|Genette’s]] [[narratology]], mainly the concept of ‘order.’ This distinguishes three entities: story, narrative, and narration. The story generally corresponds to a series of events placed its chronological order (the story time). When these events are rearranged and represented in a form that has its own sequence and features by the author, it produces a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Genette, Narrative Discourse: an Essay in Method, trans. J.E. Lewin (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1980), 33-85&lt;/ref&gt;  Even if the narrated events are not chronologically ordered, being reported in the narrative’s time, they always refer to a position in the story time.

The survey of any textual account ought to take into account its literary nature. Far from being a window that must be revealed in order to penetrate into a ‘historical truth,’ each historical document adds to the number of texts that have to be interpreted if an approachable and intelligible picture of a given historical [[Social environment|milieu]] is to be drawn. As pointed out by [[Peter Munz]], “narrative is the only literary device available which will reflect the past’s time structure.”&lt;ref&gt;“The historical narrative,” p.852. &lt;/ref&gt;  The pretension in which history is conceived as the representation of the ‘actual’ should be put aside in order to acknowledge that one can only approach past structures by contrasting them with, or bonding them to, the imaginable world. In this way, and similar to [[Gérard Genette|Genette’s]] conception of narrative order and time,  a historical narrative implies not simply an account of events that happened in the transition from one point in time to another. Thence, historical narrative is a progressive ‘redescription’ of events and people that dismantles a structure encoded in one verbal mode in the beginning in order to justify the recoding of it in another mode at the end.&lt;ref&gt;Hayden White, Tropics of Discourse (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), 97-8&lt;/ref&gt;  Narratives are, thus, structures that contain complex systems in which images of experience are drawn. 

==Background==

In order to approach new ways of making sense of narrative, one must first distinguish two different [[systems]] that can be found in the narrative structure: the sequence of events and the sequence of the actor's interactions.  The former is the order in time in which all the events take place (Genette’s narrative time). Although trivial, this identification is fundamental for the construction of the latter. I understand the sequence of [[social interactions]] as the set of the characters’ relationships ordered in relation to its appearance following the sequence of events. Both constitute interdependent systems that express the flow of the narrative on two different levels. 

Defining what constitutes a relationship depends on the specific research questions formulated for the study of the narrative. The fact that two characters are mentioned as actors in a certain event can stand as a criterion for connecting two individuals (two actors are connected by the fact that they share one reported action). Criteria can, of course, be more detailed and delimited. Depending on the specific phenomena of interest, one can frame the scope of the interactions to be identified throughout the narrative. For example, one can be interested in assessing the integration of the individual within a collective body. Indicators of social ties indicated by the text itself would define the interaction criteria. 

==Current Studies==

Authors such as Peter Bearman, Robert Faris, and James Moody have understood the sequence of events in a narrative as a complex event structure.  By suggesting that the flow of the narrated events can be problematized as a complex structure, they focus on the similarities between the social structures and the narrative. Through these similarities they have defended the applicability of network methods for the analysis of historical data contained in texts. 

Roberto Franzosi,&lt;ref&gt;“Sociology, narrative, and the quality versus quantity debate (Goethe versus Newton): Can computer-assisted story grammars help us understand the rise of Italian fascism (1919–1922)?” Theory &amp; Society 39 (2010): 593-629. Franzosi’s work has become one of the leading contemporary efforts in constructing a strong framework for quantitative narrative analysis.  See also DiMaggio, Paul, 'Cultural networks', in The Sage handbook of social network analysis, P.J. Carrington and J. Scott J. (eds.) (Thousand Oaks: Sage, 2011), 286-300.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bearman and Stovel&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bearman and Katherine Stovel, “Becoming a Nazi: A model for narrative networks,” Poetics 27 (2000): 70-90.&lt;/ref&gt; have offered modelling techniques for narrative networks by focusing on the sequence of events. These authors have visualised the story time by connecting the events from the original narrative time. The constructed ‘narrative networks’ connect the events by causal relationships, viz. if action B lead to action A, then A and B will be linked.  By working on 'narrative networks,’ these authors defend it is possible to observe and measure new structural features of the narrative. They focus on autobiographical narratives of the rise and identity of [[fascism]] (the former) and [[Nazism]] (the latter).  The substantive idea that they develop is that the observable narrative structure of life stories can provide insight into the process of identity formation among the witnesses of a delimited scope of time. 

Although these are remarkable models of applied [[quantitative narrative analysis]] and [[network theory|network analysis]], their proposed narrative networks represent sequence of events rather than of characters. These research strategies may have to be diversified in order to study aspects such as political influence and other non-institutional features of organisations or groups reported by the author through narration.

'''''Ori and the Blind Forest''''' is a [[Platform game#Platform-adventure games|platform-adventure]] [[Metroidvania]] [[video game]] developed by [[Moon Studios]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]]. The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox One]] on March 2015. In the game, players assume control of Ori, a white guardian spirit, and Sein, the "light and eyes" of the Forest's Spirit Tree. To progress in the game, players are tasked to move between platforms and solve puzzles. The game features a system called "soul links", which allows players to save at will, and an upgrade system that gives players the ability to strengthen Ori's skills.

The game was developed by Moon Studios. The game was acquired by [[Microsoft Studios]] a year after the beginning of the game's development. The game story was inspired by ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[The Iron Giant]]'', while some of the gameplay elements were inspired by the ''[[Rayman]]'' and ''[[Metroid]]'' franchises.

Upon release, the game received critical acclaim, with players praising the game's gameplay, art style, story, action sequences, musical score, and environmental design. Moon Studios co-founder [[Gennadiy Korol]] said the game was profitable for the company within a few weeks after its initial launch. A Definitive Edition was released in 2016. A sequel, ''[[Ori and the Will of the Wisps]]'', was announced during [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017]].

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Ori and the Blind Forest Screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot showing Ori and Sein (blue orb above Ori's head). The HUD at the bottom represents Ori's energy and health, as well as the progress towards the next level up.]]
''Ori and the Blind Forest'' is a 2D [[platform game]]. The player controls Ori, a white guardian spirit of indeterminate gender,&lt;ref name="Moon Studios AMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/2yxclb/hi_everyone_its_moon_studios_creators_of_ori_and/cpdto5e/|title=Moon Studios AMA |accessdate=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sein, who is the light and eyes of the Spirit Tree.&lt;ref name="XboxWire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xbox.com/2014/06/games-ori-and-the-blind-forest-e3|title=Ori and the Blind Forest Combines Beauty and Skill|work=news.xbox.com|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ori can jump, climb, and use other abilities to navigate. Sein can shoot Spirit Flames to combat enemies or break obstacles. Ori is required to interact with their environment as they jump from platforms and solve puzzles. Ori is faced with enemies while making their way to restoring the forest. The player helps Ori collect health shards, energy shards, new abilities, and upgrades. The game world unfolds to the player in the fashion of a [[Metroidvania]], with new abilities allowing the player to access previously inaccessible areas.

In addition to save points scattered in the game, players can create "soul links" at any time they choose to serve as checkpoints.&lt;ref name="HDD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN-E3"/&gt; However, soul links can only be created using energy cells collected during gameplay; the needed energy is not in abundant supply, forcing players to create them only when necessary.&lt;ref name="IGN-E3"/&gt; The player can gain ability points to buy various perks and upgrades, such as increasing the damage of Sein's Spirit Flame. These upgrades can be bought anywhere a soul link has been created and if the player has enough ability points to buy the skill they desire. An ability point is gained when Ori collects enough experience by killing enemies and destroying various plants. Each skill must be bought in sequential order from one of three ability trees to allow the next, more expensive skill to be accessible.

== Plot ==
The voice of the Spirit Tree in the forest of Nibel narrates the story of when Ori, a white guardian spirit, fell from the tree during a storm as a newborn and was adopted by a creature named Naru, who raised Ori as her own.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/games/e3-2014-ori-and-the-blind-forest-finds-a-challenge-in-sadness/|title=E3 2014: 'Ori and the Blind Forest' finds a challenge in sadness|author=Todd Martens|work=latimes.com|publisher=Tribune Newspapers|date=June 12, 2014|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cataclysmic event soon makes all of the forest wither, and Naru dies of starvation.

Jackson|work=ign.com|publisher=Ziff Davis|date=June 12, 2014|accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To restore the forest, Sein guides Ori to recover the light of three main elements supporting the balance of Nibel: Waters, Winds and Warmth.

Ori and Sein come across two beings in their quest: Gumo, the last survivor of the spider-like Gumon clan and whose home supports the Wind element; and Kuro, a giant, shadowy owl who is hostile toward Ori. Her hostility and the forest's cataclysm are explained in flashbacks. When Ori was lost, the Spirit Tree released a flash of light to look for them, which killed all of Kuro's recently hatched offspring. Determined to prevent this from happening to her yet unborn child, Kuro took away the core on top of the Spirit Tree, which is actually Sein. Without the Spirit Tree's support, the three elements cannot be sustained, and Nibel lost its balance. As the element of Wind is rekindled, Gumo, realizing what Ori and Sein intend to do, uses his clan treasure that stores the light from the Spirit Tree to revive Naru, and takes her to where Ori is.

After the final element, Warmth, is restored in the volcano Mount Horu, Kuro captures Ori and Sein as the fire from Horu starts to spread. Naru, who had been separated from Gumo, arrives to protect Ori from Kuro. Kuro softens, remembering the pain of losing her children. As the fire spreads and is about to reach her remaining egg, Kuro takes Sein back to the Spirit Tree, which emits a flash of bright light that dissipates the fire and restores the forest, but Kuro is destroyed by the light. Time passes as the forest begins to flourish once more, and Ori is shown sitting on a log watching new spirits being born in the field at the foot of the Spirit Tree. Gumo and Naru watch together from afar, before the latter goes home, where Kuro's last egg now rests, just in time to see it begin to hatch.

==Development==
''Ori and the Blind Forest'' was developed by Moon Studios, a worldwide collaboration of designers and programmers who have been working on the game four years before it was released, with Microsoft acquiring the game about a year after development started.&lt;ref name="IGN-E3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Euro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-28-ori-and-the-blind-forest-looks-great-but-plays-even-better|title=Ori and the Blind Forest looks great, but plays even better|author=Jeffrey Matulef|work=eurogamer.net|date=July 7, 2014|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the lead team members is [[Thomas Mahler]], an artist formerly working with [[Blizzard Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; According to Microsoft producer Daniel Smith, Moon Studios is not located in any one location, but instead staffers can be found throughout the world, from [[Austria]] to [[Australia]] and [[Israel]] to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Yahoo-E3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://games.yahoo.com/news/ori-blind-forest-producer-wants-210052888.html|title=Ori and the Blind Forest’s producer wants his beautiful Xbox One exclusive to play as good as it looks (interview)|author=Mike Minotti|work=Yahoo!

The designers say they were guided by works such as ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' and that it is a "coming-of-age story".&lt;ref name="GS-E3"/&gt; The designers were also heavily influenced by the work of [[Hayao Miyazaki]], particularly with one of the levels "Valley of the Wind", being a nod to ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]''.&lt;ref name="destructoid"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/ori-and-the-blind-forest-is-a-beautiful-metroidvania-276352.phtml | title=Ori and the Blind Forest is a beautiful metroidvania | publisher=Destructoid | date=June 10, 2014| accessdate= May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Washington's Post"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/03/17/ori-and-the-blind-forest-a-beautiful-version-of-gaming-good-ole-days/ | title=Ori and the Blind Forest: A beautiful version of gaming’s good ole days | publisher=The Washington's Post | date=March 17, 2015 | accessdate= May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art style is meant to appear hand-drawn, similar to the more recent ''Rayman'' titles that utilize [[Ubisoft]]'s "UbiArt" graphics engine; the game instead uses the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] engine.&lt;ref name="HDD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GS-E3"/&gt; The game takes place in one large map, rendered at 1080p and 60 frames per second with no visible loading time as the player explores.&lt;ref name="HDD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo-E3"/&gt; According to Mahler, the game's backgrounds are all individual components, with none duplicated as in other similar titles. As an example, Mahler explained, "You see this tree in the background and this mushroom and this rock? That's the one and only place you'll ever see those assets."&lt;ref name="Euro"/&gt;

The game was first unveiled at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014|E3 2014]] during Microsoft's pre-show press conference at the [[Galen Center]];&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; E3 was also the first time a number of Moon Studios employees actually met face-to-face.&lt;ref name="Euro"/&gt; Microsoft's Yusuf Mehdi, in charge of marketing for Xbox One, stated that they considered opening the conference with ''Ori'', but instead chose ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]''.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; During E3, attendees waited in long lines to play a demo version of the game, often waiting in queues 7-8 people deep for each of the four consoles featuring the game.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;

Sometime after E3, Moon Studios announced on the game website that an Xbox 360 version of ''Ori and the Blind Forest'' was in development and planned for release sometime in early 2015. In November 2014, Moon Studios updated the status of the game and announced plans to push back the launch of the title into "early 2015" for Xbox One and PC, but no further mention of the Xbox 360 version was made at the time. Asked to clarify the status of the Xbox 360 edition, Moon Studios confirmed it was still in development and would be released later in 2015.&lt;ref name="Crunchyroll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/11/24-1/ori-and-the-blind-forest-platformer-delayed-to-2015|title='Ori and the Blind Forest' Platformer Delayed to 2015|work=crunchyroll.com|publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|January 2018}}, there has been no further announcement on the status of the Xbox 360 release.

A "Definitive Edition" was announced at [[Gamescom 2015]]. The expansion contains new areas, mechanics, and artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/08/06/ori-and-the-blind-forest-definitive-edition-coming-this-fall-with-new-content/|title=Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition coming this fall with new content|first=Stephany |last=Nunneley|work=[[VG247]]|date=August 6, 2015|accessdate=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it adds in an "easy", "hard", and "One Life" difficulty levels, and enables fast-travel between spirit wells to help traverse the game's world. This version was released on March 11, 2016 for Xbox One, on the one-year anniversary of the game, while the Windows version was released shortly afterwards on April 27, 2016. Those who have already purchased the original game are able to upgrade to the Definitive Edition for $5.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/3/1/11136546/ori-and-the-blind-forest-definitive-edition-pc-release-date | title = Ori and the Blind Forest Definitive Edition comes to PC, Xbox One on March 11 | first = Arthur | last= Gies | date = March 1, 2016 | accessdate= March 1, 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/3/9/11186750/ori-and-the-blind-forest-definitive-edition-price-pc-delay | title = Ori and the Blind Forest's Definitive Edition delayed on PC | first = Samit | last =Sarkar | date = March 9, 2016 | accessdate = March 9, 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, [[Nordic Games (company)|Nordic Games]] announced that they had partnered with Moon Studios and Microsoft to release a retail version of ''The Definitive Edition'' for Microsoft Windows.

''Ori and the Blind Forest'' received generally favourable reviews, according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]], with praise particularly directed to the game's story, visuals, gameplay, music, exploration, and environmental design. Metacritic gave the Microsoft Windows version 88/100 based on 12 reviews, and the Xbox One version 88/100 based on 73 reviews.&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCXONE" /&gt;

Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner gave the game a 9.5/10, praising its accessible yet challenging gameplay, well-designed controls, strong storytelling, surprising plot twists, rewarding exploration, orchestrated music, breathtaking and mesmerizing environmental design, as well as the wonderfully scripted challenges, which requires players to utilize creative thinking. However, he stated that the combat system in the game is not as refined as the platforming. He named the game "one of the best games of the year" and claimed that "There isn't a bad moment in ''Ori and the Blind Forest''".&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; Chris Carter from [[Destructoid]] gave the game a 9.5/10, praising its well-executed and light narrative, satisfying upgrades as well as the visuals, which he compared to the ''[[Rayman]]'' series, but he stated that "[Ori] easily surpass them in quality." He also praised the game for allowing players to set their own checkpoints anytime. He summarized the review by saying that "It succeeds in being both a great introduction to the genre and a rewarding experience for the hardcore audience" and called the game "a new classic [as a metroidvania]"&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt;

Ray Carsillo from [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] praised the huge variety of environments, the delicate hand-drawn art style, remarkable and memorable story, and the quick save system, which has effectively avoided annoyance and frustration. He also praised the game for putting emphasis on platforming, puzzle-solving, and exploration instead of combat as it allows players to fully appreciate the level design. He also praised the game for capturing the balance between too forgiving and too punishing. However, he criticized the framerate issue as well as the game for forbidding players to re-enter certain areas. He stated that "[''Ori and the Blind Forest''] is polished enough to rarely break the immersion it inspires. It's one of my favorite titles of 2015 so far and an unforgettable debut for indie developer Moon Studios."&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt; Kevin VanOrd from [[GameSpot]] gave the game a 9/10, praising its vibrant visuals, carefully designed levels, thrilling and exciting escape sequence, terrific pacing, rewarding challenges, as well as the narrative, which he compared to ''[[Okami]]'' and ''[[Panzer Dragoon Orta]]''. He also praised the game's opening sequence, calling it "among the best story sequences of any game." However, he criticized the occasionally frustrating levels.&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt;

Lucas Sullivan from [[GamesRadar]] gave the game a score of 8/10, praising its exquisite animation, phenomenal atmosphere, uplifting music, and intuitive gameplay, which he stated "has conveyed a real sense of lightweight agility." However, he criticized the save system, which may lead to constant death, and the difficulty spikes during the escape sequences. He summarized the game by saying that "Completing ''Ori''{{'}}s six-to-nine-hour journey will certainly leave you feeling warm, fuzzy, and accomplished{{snd}}just be ready to dig in for some particularly trying segments."&lt;ref name="GRadar"/&gt; Nick Tan from [[Game Revolution]] gave the game a 4/5, praising its presentation and platforming but criticizing the short length, meaningless health bar, low replay value, and lack of direction and guidelines in escape sequences.&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt;

The game is considered an example of video games becoming closer to [[art]]. For example, [[Chris Melissinos]] commented that the video game audience was not used to seeing ''Ori and the Blind Forest''{{'}}s dreamlike sensitivity style of art usually reserved for high profile animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/arts/gallery/video-games-highest-form-of-art/index.html|title=Can video games be art?|website=CNN|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sales ===
According to Moon Studios' [[Thomas Mahler]], ''Ori and the Blind Forest'' became profitable for Microsoft within one week of the game's launch on Xbox One and PC; and [[Gennadiy Korol]], co-founder of Moon Studios, said the game was profitable for the studio itself within "a couple of weeks."&lt;ref name="Ori-Profit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/celebrated-xbox-one-game-ori-and-the-blind-forest-/1100-6426518/|title=Celebrated Xbox One Game Ori and the Blind Forest Profitable in One Week|author=Eddie Makuch|work=gamespot.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|date=April 9, 2015|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahler described Microsoft as being "super-happy" with ''Ori'' and hinted that the franchise may see a [[Ori and the Will of the Wisps|future installment]]. He also stated that the Xbox 360 version of the game was still in development and was expected to launch later in the spring (Q2) of 2015.&lt;ref name="Ori-Profit"/&gt;

'''Pellefant''' is a Swedish comic book character, a blue living toy elephant. He was created by [[Rune Andréasson]].

Pellefant's first appearance was in Andréasson's book ''Pellefant i Gottlandet'' ("Pellefant in Candyland"), which was written in the 1940s, but first published in 1954. Pellefant got his own comic book series from 1965 to 1993, although Andréasson very early left both illustration and scriptwriting over to others, first to [[Gösta Gummesson]] and the Dane [[Gil Johansen]], and also [[Georges Bess]] during his stay in Sweden.

Pellefant has appeared in Finland in the 1980s and 1990s in his own comic book series, and also for a short time in the ''[[Bamse]]'' comic book.

==Characters==
; Pellefant : A small blue elephant, headstrong and priggish, somewhat like [[Karlsson-on-the-Roof]]. His way of often acting first and thinking later often leads Pellefant into difficult situations, which he always fails to realise, because he views himself as the best in the world. But his loud, trumpetous voice often helps him deal with the difficult situations.
; Pip : A small [[mouse]] who is Pellefant's best friend and often saves him from difficult situations, like [[Jiminy Cricket]].
; Filur : Originally a small and evil [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who often failed in his [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. After Gil Johansen took over scriptwriting, Filur became nicer and nicer, eventually becoming a bickering friend of Pellefant and Pip, or occasionally even a genuine friend.
; The liquorice troll : A large and slow-witted figure with black fur, who often causes mischief. He is Filur's companion but is often heavily exploited by him.
; Other toys : Pellefant and Pip live in a house together with a handful of other toy figures, including a [[cowboy]] doll, an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] doll, a girl doll and a toy [[dog]], among others.

'''Pixelles''', located in [[Montreal]], is a non-profit organization devoted to increasing the number of women making games. It provides women with tools to make their own games.

Programs are targeted towards Montreal-based women who are interested in making [[video games]] but for one reason or another have never managed to do so.

Pixelles provides motivation and the resources to help these women take the first big step and create their first game. Through incubator events, women are [[empowerment|empowered]] to express themselves in a new medium by learning new skills that they may use in their future careers. Alumnae have gone on to create more games and be empowered to participate in the Montreal's game community as a culture, professional, and a creative space.

==History==
In response to issues of [[sexism in video gaming]],Pixelles aims to promote diversity in the game-making community and [[video game culture]] on a grassroots level. The idea for Pixelles was inspired by Toronto's [[Difference Engine Initiative]], a game-making incubator organized in 2011 by the [[Hand Eye Society]], a video game arts organization. [[Feminists in Games]], an organization of feminist digital researchers, approached game-hobbyist Rebecca Cohen Palacios and game designer Tanya Short to bring a similar project to Montreal.&lt;ref name="thelinknewspaper.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/4194|title=Lady-Players|work=thelinknewspaper.ca|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first incubator had received over sixty applications.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgmagonline.com/2015/07/13/pixels-and-pixelles-an-interview-with-tanya-short/ |title=Pixels and Pixelles: An Interview with Tanya Short |last=Biot |first=Sabrina |last2=Biot |first2=Sabrina |website=CGMagazine |access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debut of the Pixelles in Montreal coincided with the Twitter awareness [[hashtag]] campaign called [[#1reasonwhy]], where women in the game industry provided personal experiences about sexism in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultmontreal.com/2012/11/pixelles-calling-all-game-designing-ladies/#sthash.oyfUbO7z.dpuf|title=Pixelles: Calling all (game-designing) ladies|work=Cult MTL|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pixelles official became a non-profit organization in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pixelles.ca/blog/2016/06/agm-2016|title=Pixelles Annual General Meeting 2016 {{!}} Pixelles (Montreal)|website=pixelles.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Through annual incubators, game jams, and monthly workshops, Pixelles helps women realize their own potential at making whatever game they can dream of. As an art form, games benefit from having more diverse voices contributing to its growth.&lt;ref name="Pixelles Montreal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pixelles-montreal|title=Pixelles Montreal|work=Indiegogo|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incubator, Follow Along, &amp; Showcase===
A set of classes that span once day a for six weeks provides advice on tools and applications, input from mentors, and support from the rest of the group. The incubator is open to anyone who identifies as female and can attend the workshops in Montreal, no former development experience required. Participants are selected through an application process. In 2013, ten women were chosen from over sixty applicants.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TanyaShort/20130320/188935/|title=Pixelles Postmortem: How to Increase Game Creator Diversity NOW|work=Gamasutra.com|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of each incubator, Pixelles hosts a showcase to celebrate the new game makers. The 2013 showcase clocked over 150 attendees from friends to indies to people from AAA industry coming out to support and celebrate [[women and video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-11-14-pixelles-game-incubator|title=Empowerment through development: The Pixelles Game Incubator|work=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The showcase is archived on the official website where you can play games from the [http://pixelles.ca/blog/2013/03/play-the-games 2013] and [http://pixelles.ca/blog/2014/03/play-the-games-from-our-2nd-showcase 2014 showcases].

Men could not sign up, but are able to participate either as mentors or as play-testers. They are also able to sign up for the follow-along program, where material and exercises covered in the program were posted online.&lt;ref name="thelinknewspaper.ca"/&gt; Follow-Alongs do not have access to the meetings or the workspace, but they can still follow the deadlines and make a game.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra.com"/&gt; In 2013, out of over thirty follow along sign ups, four successfully made a game during the allotted time.

=== Workshops ===
Monthly workshops encourage them to learn new game development skills such as programming languages, 3d modelling, game design, etc.&lt;ref name="Pixelles Montreal"/&gt; Volunteer led [[workshop]]s are about 2 hours long with a maximum of 20 participants. They are usually hosted on the 2nd last Thursday or Tuesday evening of the month. Previous workshops covered topics such as working with [[Twine]]; an introduction to game design, 3D sculpting with [[ZBrush]], 3ds max animation, programming with [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]; and making a [[dating sim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pixelles.ca/blog/category/tutorials|title=Tutorials|work=Pixelles.ca|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mentoring ===
Through the 1:1 mentorship program and socials, Pixelles helps women network to gain role models and career advice. One of the most successful events was a speed mentoring night where twenty professionals and twenty aspirants conducted round-robin interviews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[mentorship]] program connects aspiring and junior women in game development to experienced professionals. Mentors, who come from a network of experts from every discipline, are male and female. Mentors provide feedback on your portfolio, code, and/or CV while also discussing how to improve your chances in an increasingly competitive industry.

'''Professional wrestling in the United States''', until the 1920s, was viewed as a legitimate sport. This view did not endure into the 1930s, as [[professional wrestling]] became identified with modern theatrics, or "admitted fakeness" ("[[kayfabe]]"), moving away from being a showcase for true competition. The scripted nature of the art has made critics view it as an illegitimate sport, particularly in comparison to [[boxing]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[amateur wrestling]], and the real sport itself, [[wrestling]]. No major promoter or wrestler denies that modern professional wrestling has predetermined match outcomes.

Through the advent of television in the 1950s and cable in the 1980s, professional wrestling began appearing in powerful media outlets, reaching never before seen numbers of viewers. It became an international phenomenon with the expansion of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). Throughout the 1990s, professional wrestling achieved highs in both viewers and financial success during a time of fierce competition among competing [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotions]], such as WWF, [[World Championship Wrestling]], and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]].

The nature of professional wrestling changed dramatically to better fit television, enhancing character traits and storylines. Television also helped many wrestlers break into mainstream media, becoming influential celebrities and icons of [[popular culture]]. In the United States, in the First Golden Age of professional wrestling in the 1940s–1950s, [[Gorgeous George]] gained mainstream popularity, followed in the Second Golden Age in the 1980s–1990s by [[Ric Flair]], [[Andre the Giant]], [[Hulk Hogan]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Bret Hart]], [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], [[The Undertaker]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], [[Kurt Angle]], and [[Triple H]].

== Beginnings (1860s–1940s) ==
=== Carnival days ===
Professional wrestling, in the sense of traveling performers paid for mass entertainment in staged matches, began in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] period in the late 1860s and 1870s.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, wrestlers were often athletes with amateur wrestling experience who competed at traveling carnivals with [[Carny|carnies]] working as their promoters and bookers. Grand circuses included wrestling exhibitions, quickly enhancing them through colorful costumes and fictional biographies for entertainment, disregarding their competitive nature.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1/&gt; Wrestling exhibits during the late 19th century were also shown across the United States in countless "athletic shows" (or "at shows"), where experienced wrestlers offered open challenges to the audience.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1/&gt; It was at these shows, often done for high-stakes gambling purposes, that the nature of the sport changed through the competing interests of three groups of people: the [[impresario]]s, the carnies, and the [[Barnstorming|barnstormers]].&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1/&gt;

Impresarios were the managers who chose how a wrestler could gain fame and interest among the fans, creating personas and improvising matches to make them more interesting. Carnies, who traveled and wrestled at these events, used tricks to protect their money and reputations during competitions, devising little-known and often dangerous wrestling moves, called "hooks." Hooks are illegal in conventional amateur wrestling, but have high rates of success against even the most athletic and experienced of competitors, essentially removing rules from professional wrestling. In addition, some spectators capable of beating the carnies roamed the country to compete in open challenges, setting side bets to make money. The barnstormers competed as traveling wrestlers did and often cooperated with the carnies to stage the matches, providing enormous profits for both sides in betting.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1/&gt; Through the interest in money-making among the three groups, wrestling became a business-oriented entertainment venue, distinguishing itself further and further from its authentic amateur wrestling background.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Murray|title=Wrestling Fans-Why Tell 'Em?|publisher=Los Angeles Times|page=1|date=1985-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrestling performers were arranged in a pyramid hierarchy of fame and money, based strictly on athletic talent. The lowest were the journeymen, young performers with promise and some skill, but who relied mainly on showmanship to gain fans. The actual wrestlers, called "shooters" because of their ability to "[[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]]", or fight real matches competitively, were more successful and less common. At the top were the elites, or the hookers, named for their ability to use arcane wrestling hooks to inflict damage and serious injury on the competition without much effort.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1/&gt; Wrestlers considered themselves among a select group, and often kept the fact that their sport was commonly faked—to an extent—in high secrecy.&lt;ref name=sex,lies&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|author2=Mooneyham, Mike|title=Sex, Lies, and Professional Wrestling|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used a jargon of their own (often shared with carnies) to communicate so the audience would not understand them, including the word "[[kayfabe]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/kayfabe/|title="kayfabe" definition|publisher=Double-Tongued Dictionary|accessdate=2007-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Farmer" Burns and Frank Gotch era ===
During the late 19th century-early 20th century, wrestling was dominated by [[Martin Burns|Martin "Farmer" Burns]] and his pupil, [[Frank Gotch]]. Burns was renowned as a competitive wrestler, who, despite never weighing more than 160 pounds during his wrestling career, fought over 6,000 wrestlers (at a time when most were competitive contests) and lost fewer than 10 of them.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch3&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|chapter=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gained a reputation for training some of the best wrestlers of the era, including Gotch, known as one of America's first sports superstars.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch3/&gt;

Gotch, regarded as "peerless" at his peak, was the first to actually claim the world's undisputed heavyweight championship by beating all contenders in North America and Europe. He became the world's champion by beating European wrestling champion [[George Hackenschmidt|Georg Hackenschmidt]], both in 1908 and 1911, seen by modern wrestling historians as two of the most significant matches in wrestling history.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch3/&gt;

The popularity of wrestling during the early 20th century was highest in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], where ethnic European communities, many of them [[Germany|German]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[Czechs|Czech]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]], Greek, and [[Scandinavia]]n in ancestry, continued to carry on fighting styles practiced in their home nations.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch3/&gt; At this time, during the late 19th century, and early 20th century, the majority of wrestling was still competitive, and it was immensely popular. In fact, wrestling's popularity was second only to [[baseball]] from 1900 to the early 1920s, launching [[trading card]]s and competitive wrestling programs in colleges, high schools, and athletic clubs, legacies that have endured to the present day.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1/&gt;

Wrestling's popularity experienced a dramatic tailspin in 1915 to 1920, becoming distanced from the American public because of widespread doubt of its legitimacy and status as a competitive sport. Wrestlers during the time recount it as largely faked by the 1880s. It also waned due to Gotch's retirement in 1913, and no new wrestling superstar emerging to captivate the audience's attention.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1/&gt;

=== Expansion (1920s–1930s) ===
{{Main|Gold Dust Trio}}
Following the retirement of Frank Gotch, professional wrestling—except in the Midwest where legitimate wrestlers such as Michigan's "Poison Ivy" took on all comers at State Fairs—was losing popularity fast.&lt;ref&gt;''Detroit News'' archives, 1925–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Media attention focused on the illegitimacy of wrestling instead of its athleticism, and without a superstar like Gotch, no major personality reached a wide fanbase.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, three professional wrestlers, [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed Lewis]], [[Billy Sandow]], and [[Toots Mondt]], joined to form their own promotion in the 1920s, modifying their in-ring product to attract fans. The three were referred to as the "Gold Dust Trio" due to their financial success. Their promotion was the first to use time-limit matches, "flashy" new holds, and signature maneuvers.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45/&gt; They also popularized [[tag team]] wrestling, introducing new tactics such as distracting the referee, to make the matches more exciting.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45/&gt;

The Trio's lasting legacy, and perhaps their greatest innovation within professional wrestling, was the use of a regular group of wrestlers for a packaged show.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45 /&gt; Rather than paying traveling wrestlers to perform on certain dates and combining wrestlers in match-ups when they were available, they decided to keep wrestlers for months and years at a time, allowing long-term angles and feuds to develop. This was the key to their success; they were able to keep wrestlers from their competition, and were able to have regular wrestling cards.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45/&gt; Their business succeeded quickly, gaining popularity for its freshness and unique approach to wrestling; a traveling stable of wrestlers.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg46&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trio gained great popularity nationwide during their best years, roughly 1920 to 1925, when they performed in the Eastern territory, acquiring fans from the highly exposed big cities.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg46/&gt;

The Trio was dealt a severe blow by [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]], when he beat the rookie [[Wayne Munn]] for their world heavyweight championship, against the original booking.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg47&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munn, who had been recruited to wrestling and [[Push (professional wrestling)|pushed]] to the level of champion in only a few months, was the Trio's new star and main attraction. Zbyszko was supposed to lose to Munn, but refused to follow along, beating Munn so decisively and thoroughly that the referee awarded him the title to prevent a riot.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg47/&gt; In addition, Zbyszko quickly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Drop|dropped]] the title to [[Joe Stecher]], a rival of Ed Lewis, making the situation worse for the Trio.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg47/&gt;

Stecher, although an able booker, was afraid of losing his championship, refusing to wrestle many contenders as a result. This made it impossible for the Trio to retrieve it. They responded by calling the Munn-Zbyszko match illegitimate, and reinstated Munn as champion, but quickly had him drop it to Lewis. This left two champions, Ed Lewis and Joe Stecher, who were regarded as the dominant wrestlers of the period.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg48&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stecher and Lewis agreed to a unification match years later, in 1928, when Stecher gave in and lost the title to Lewis.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg48/&gt; By this time, the Zbyszko double-cross had already caused irreparable damage, detracting from the Trio's dominance over the wrestling industry.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg48/&gt; In addition, the build-up of Munn followed by such a humiliating loss had devalued his title and credibility as a major wrestling superstar permanently.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg48/&gt;

=== Growth of wrestling promotions ===
In March 1887, [[Evan Lewis (wrestler)|Evan Lewis]] defeated [[Joe Acton]] for the American Catch-as-Catch-Can championship in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingReviews/buzz_on_excerpt.html|title=The Buzz on Professional Wrestling: Book Excerpt|author=Keith, Scott|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, every wrestling promotion had created its own [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championship]], which was considered each company's pride and glory. As promotions were attempting to become nationally renowned, acquiring rival championships marked victory.

In the 1930s and 1940s, small wrestling promotions had fierce competition with each other, often stealing talents and "invading" enemy companies to win over fans. With inter-promotional matches occurring nationwide, the promotions were vying for dominance. In 1948, wrestling reached new heights after a loose confederation was formed between independent wrestling companies. This was known as the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA). In the late 1940s to 1950s, the NWA chose [[Lou Thesz]] to unify the various world championships into a single "World Heavyweight" title. Thesz's task was not easy, as some promoters, reluctant to lose face, went so far as to [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] title matches to keep their own champions popular with the fans.

== Television era (1950s–1970s) ==
{{see also|List of professional wrestling television series}}
Following the advent of [[television]], professional wrestling matches began to be aired nationally during the 1950s, reaching a larger fanbase than ever before. This was a time of enormous growth for professional wrestling, as rising demand and national expansion made it a much more popular and lucrative form of entertainment than in decades previous. This was called a "Golden Age" for the wrestling industry. It was also a time of great change in both the character and professionalism of wrestlers as a result of the appeal of television. Wrestling fit naturally with television because it was easy to understand, had drama, comedy and colorful characters, and was inexpensive for production.&lt;ref name=sex,lies10&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hooker-pg101&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1948 to 1955, each of the three major television networks broadcast wrestling shows; the largest supporter being the [[DuMont Television Network]].&lt;ref name=sex,lies/&gt;

=== Gimmick characters ===
[[Gorgeous George]] became one of the biggest stars during this period, gaining media attention for his outrageous character, which was described as flamboyant and charismatic.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg100&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already popular among wrestling fans, he became renowned after comedian [[Bob Hope]] noticed his performance in the Hollywood Legion Stadium in 1945 and 1946, and began to use him for jokes on his radio station.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg100/&gt; The publicity brought many people into wrestling events, bringing his stardom to a high point where promoters and television stations alike were paying generously for his performances.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg100/&gt;

Gorgeous George's impact on wrestling has been interpreted in many ways, demonstrating how fast television changed the product from athletics to performance. His legacy was the enormous change in wrestling personas he inspired. Before him, wrestlers imitated "ethnic terrors" ([[Nazism|Nazis]], [[Arab]]s, etc.), but his success birthed a more individualistic and [[narcissist]] form of character.&lt;ref name=sex,lies-pg11&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also among the first to use entrance music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/george.asp|title=Gorgeous George|publisher=[[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]]|author=Malnoske, Andrew|accessdate=2009-12-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705021040/http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/george.asp|archivedate=2009-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television changed the on-screen product in many other ways as well. Originally, the impact of television was not well planned for during this period.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg101/&gt; [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|Promotional spots]], which are now used as pre-match rants by wrestlers to warm up the crowds, were often used for simple greetings and welcomes to the local crowds, missing in-ring personality boosts and character skits during this period. No one would discuss promos before shooting them, and promoters usually would not spend time helping wrestlers in front of the camera.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg100/&gt;

=== Competitiveness compromised ===
Professional wrestlers themselves began to change. As popularity grew during the mid-1950s, many more wrestlers joined the ranks of the business, and the number of professional wrestlers over 2,000, far more than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many new wrestlers began fresh without notions of athletic sportsmanship that was popular in competitive arenas, however; they began with dreams of becoming televised superstars. This proved especially true as the product began to lose athletic talent, relying on blood and acrobatic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrestling's competitiveness was degraded by television, a fact regarded by many in the business as a natural effect of television over competition. The New York wrestling office soon became dominant, as it refused to use competitive wrestlers, and instead focused on attracting televised entertainment.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg125&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the first of the more comic book-like characters known to professional wrestling today was [[Antonino Rocca]].&lt;ref name=hooker-pg118&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively weak in wrestling ability, his marketable personality and barefoot acrobatics attracted fans and made him a national superstar, especially popular among [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] fans.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg118/&gt; The New York Wrestling office used him to revive the promotion on television, and found him far easier to exploit than a more athletically skilled wrestler, enabling the office to negotiate wrestler contracts tremendously in its favor.&lt;ref name="hooker-pg125"/&gt;

=== Moderate slowdown ===
By the late 1950s, professional wrestling had lost its high ratings, and producers, realizing that they had overexposed it, soon dropped most wrestling shows from their lineups.&lt;ref name=sex,lies-pg11/&gt; The remaining televised wrestling promoters had small, local [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows, which network producers placed as late-night and Saturday and/or Sunday morning/afternoon fillers rather than signature programming.&lt;ref name=sex,lies-pg13&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|last=Assael|first=Shaun|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoters used localized television as a weapon for eliminating the competition by purchasing airtime from rival territories, effectively putting them out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NWA Professional Wrestling Territories.png|330px|thumb|The [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories|NWA territory system]] in North America]]
The NWA was the most dominant wrestling body in the 1950s, and a large number of wrestling promotions had been under its leadership. Many promoters, however, viewed it as a crooked tyrant, holding back innovative changes in the sport. It was during this time that several promoters found reason to leave the organization, managing to find niches in the United States. The most prominent of these were the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), which became the most popular wrestling promotion during the 1960s, and the New York-based World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), renamed WWF in 1979.

As a top wrestler in the 1950s, [[Verne Gagne]] formed his own promotion in the NWA in 1957, which soon became the lead promotion with Gagne winning the [[World Heavyweight Championship (Omaha version)|World Heavyweight Championship of Omaha]]. After unsuccessfully lobbying for a title match with the NWA Champion, however, Gagne broke away from the NWA in 1960, renaming his promotion the American Wrestling Association, and making it the dominant organization of the 1960s. Named the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]] soon after, Gagne was the top wrestler, and engaged in many feuds with heel wrestlers, most notably [[Nick Bockwinkel]], and was the AWA's top draw until his retirement in 1981.

[[Bruno Sammartino]] carried the WWWF during the 1960s and 1970s. His brawling, power moves, and personal charisma helped him become the most popular American wrestler during this time period. During the period when [[Madison Square Garden|MSG]] was the WWWF's primary arena, Sammartino headlined more Garden cards than any other wrestler (211), including 187 sellouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/bruno-sammartino-dies-at-82-wwe-superstars-greats-react-to-loss-of-the-living-legend/|title=Bruno Sammartino dies at 82: WWE superstars, greats react to loss of 'The Living Legend'|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This is a lie, Dave Meltzer has pointed out many times that the number is highly inflated, just because a credible news station reports/gets fooled by wrestling lies doesn't make it true.--&gt;

The AWA was no longer the top promotion after the WWWF rejoined the NWA. The AWA reached new heights, however, after powerhouse wrestler [[Hulk Hogan]] gained nationwide attention from starring in ''[[Rocky III]]'', and became a solid fan favorite. Despite Hogan being the AWA's top draw, Gagne would not let him be champion, believing technical wrestlers, like him and Nick Bockwinkel, should be the focus of a wrestling company. Since founding the AWA, Gagne had built the company off of technical wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20081003000251/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2007/04/26/71708 Pile-driving, gut-busting, back-breaking theater - Minnesota Daily]&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan left in 1983, irreparably damaging the AWA.

In spite of all this, the NWA as a unit was still on top, and gained huge dominance through [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW), becoming the first nationally broadcast wrestling program on cable television in 1979. It aired on the [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] network.&lt;ref name="Molinaro-Slam"/&gt; By 1981, GCW became the most watched show on cable television.&lt;ref name="Molinaro-Slam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingFeatures/tbs1-can.html|title=End of an era on TBS: Solie, Georgia and 'Black Saturday'|last=Molinaro|first=John|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explosion (1980–present) ==
=== 1980s wrestling boom ===
{{Main|1980s wrestling boom}}
[[File:Hulk Hogan3.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Hulk Hogan]] was the face of the WWF during the 1980s, and it is for this reason that the decade is also known as the Hulkamania era]]
The 1980s represented professional wrestling's greatest period of televised entertainment, reaching widespread popularity among American youth, as well as producing some of its most spectacular characters. In comparison to the declining support of media outlets during the 1960s and 1970s, professional wrestling, notably the emerging World Wrestling Federation (WWF; abridged from WWWF in 1979), received great exposure through its reappearance on network television. The WWF expanded nationally through the acquisition of talent from competing promotions and, because it was the only company to air televised wrestling nationally, became synonymous with the industry, monopolizing the industry and the fanbase. The WWF's owner [[Vince McMahon]] revolutionized the sport by coining the term "[[sports entertainment]]" to describe his on-screen product, admitting to its fakery as well as enhancing its appeal to children.

The WWF became the most colorful and well-known wrestling brand to children because of its child-oriented characters, soap opera dramaticism and cartoon-like personas. Most notable was the muscular Hulk Hogan, who marked the 1980s with his "all-American" persona. His sheer size, colorful attire, charisma and extravagance made his main events into excellent ratings draws. By January 1984, Hogan's legions of fans and his dominant role in the industry was termed "Hulkamania." Hogan sold out arenas all across the United States and earned the WWF millions of dollars, making it the number one entity in all of professional wrestling; moments after Hogan defeated [[The Iron Sheik]] for the WWF World Heavyweight Title, [[Gorilla Monsoon]] famously proclaimed "Hulkamania is here."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam07/exclusives/superstarturningpoints WWE: TV Shows &gt; SummerSlam &gt; Exclusives &gt; Superstar Turning Points in WWE history]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, faces and heels became a generally more obvious and important part of wrestling. 'Gimmicks' were more popular, and it widely became a popular sport again. Wrestling was generally seen more as a form of fun and entertainment, however, than an official sport. It was more about building up face/heel feuds such as [["Rowdy" Roddy Piper]]/Hulk Hogan and going into a big blow off match, which people loved. The WWF broke its way into mainstream entertainment and regularly brought in celebrities for events.

The "Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection" was a period of cooperation and cross-promotion between the WWF and elements of the music industry. The WWF attracting a degree of mainstream attention with [[Cyndi Lauper]] joining in 1984 and WWF personalities appeared in her music videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/columns/misc/jakehamar04.html|title=Understanding The Mystique Of Captain Lou Albano|accessdate=2007-04-05|author=Hamir, Jake|date=March 2006|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan gained mainstream popularity for appearing in the film ''[[Rocky III]]'', reaching to an even greater level of celebrity. In 1985, ''[[Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling]]'', an [[Animated cartoon|animated television series]] starring the character of Hogan, expanded Hogan's young fanbase.&lt;ref name="hhrnw"&gt;[http://www.tv.com/hulk-hogans-rock-n-wrestling/show/3843/summary.html?full_summary=1&amp;tag=showspace_links;full_summary Hulk Hogan's Rock 'N' Wrestling]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the NWA's renowned and highly successful territory system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aw8hS9psIsI/TX2U4tyXq7I/AAAAAAAAAGo/pYb5ZvDMbOg/s1600/WrestlingTerritories.png|title=WrestlingTerritories.png|author=|work=Freakin' Awesome Network Forums :: Freakin' Awesome Wrestling Forum :: (w)Rest of Wrestling|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was slowly dying, with [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) becoming the center of the entire NWA. While the WWF had their major stars at almost all of their shows, the NWA could only manage to have a few of its stars at one show at a time, so as to promote the product in every territory. After the WWF gained huge dominance with Wrestlemania, Crockett responded to the success of the WWF and successfully acquired time slots on TBS,&lt;ref&gt;[http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingFeatures/tbs2-can.html End of an era on TBS: Crockett, Flair and 'The Clashes']&lt;/ref&gt; and would continue to buy out NWA promotions between 1985 and 1987 as well. The advent of nationwide television also weakened the system. Wrestlers could no longer travel to a new market and establish a new persona, since fans there already knew who they were. Meanwhile, McMahon took advantage of this phenomenon by purchasing promotions all over the continent, in order to produce a widely popular nationwide television program and make the WWF the only viewing choice.

To counter the NWA's primary [[supercard]], [[Starrcade]], the WWF created its flagship show, [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]], available on 135 [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit networks]]. The show was a huge success with Hogan, who won in the main event, going on to appear on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200552|title=Hulk Hogan|author=Patrick Jones|publisher=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture|accessdate=2007-11-22|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the swimsuit issue, it was the magazine's best seller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/info/faq/hogan.shtml|title=Hulk Hogan - FAQ|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and following WrestleMania, four WWF programs were among the ten most watched shows on cable television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966187,00.html|title=Hype! Hell Raising! Hulk Hogan!|first=Richard|last=Corliss|date=1985-04-15|publisher=TIME|accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional wrestling began to become mainstream, thanks, in large part, to the appeal of Hulkamania among children. Large television networks also took wrestling into their weekly programming, including ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event|Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', premiering on [[NBC]] in 1985, the first wrestling show to air [[prime time]] since 1955. [[ESPN]] also began airing professional wrestling for the first time, first airing [[Pro Wrestling USA]] shows—which were created as an alliance between the NWA and AWA in 1984, in an effort to counter the national success the WWF was gaining—and later AWA shows, after Pro Wrestling USA fell apart by 1986. The WWF also became an international success too.

[[WrestleMania III]], with a reported record attendance of 93,173 people, is widely considered to be the pinnacle of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html|title=Steamboat - Savage rule WrestleMania 3|last=Powell|first=John|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode of ''[[WWF The Main Event#The Main Event I|The Main Event]]'' is the highest rated professional wrestling television show to date, with a 15.2 rating and 33 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/hall_of_fame/36592/|title=411's Wrestling Hall of Fame Class of 2006: Andre The Giant|publisher=411mania|date=2006-01-18|accessdate=2007-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both had a main event featuring Hulk Hogan battling André the Giant for the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]]. Following WrestleMania III, the WWF added to its franchise and created both the [[Survivor Series]], to [[counterprogramming|counter-programming]] against Starrcade directly on PPV, and the [[Royal Rumble]], to counter-programming against the [[Bunkhouse Stampede]] originally on the USA cable networks before transitioning to pay-per-view in subsequent years. The NWA responded by creating [[Clash of the Champions]] on TBS to compete against [[WrestleMania IV]].

Wrestling promotions across the United States feared being forced into bankruptcy by the WWF. They began to unify and conglomerate under more centralized leadership rather than continue independently. Competing promotions aired better talent and attempted to regain their audiences.  In late 1987, [[Continental Wrestling Association]] wrestler and co-promoter [[Jerry Lawler]] had also joined the AWA, and helped establish a relationship between the AWA and CWA, which was formally an NWA territory, that would be somewhat of a revival of Pro Wrestling USA.  In 1988, the struggling World Class Wrestling Association (formerly known as [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] until it withdrew from the NWA in 1986) and Continental Wrestling Federation (known as [[Continental Championship Wrestling]] until it was bought out in 1988) would also take part in this alliance, which agreed to unify the WCWA and AWA Heavyweight Titles at Superclash III. Superclash III was not a success, however, and the second Pro Wrestling USA alliance soon fell apart. CWA co-promoter [[Jerry Jarrett]] then bought out the WCWA and renamed the unified company as the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA).  Jerry Lawler also took his AWA Title to Jarrett's promotion, and the belt was renamed as the USWA Heavyweight Title. The AWA was able to create a new belt, but the end of 1990, company profits had dwindled so badly that the company went out of business. NWA President [[Bob Geigel]] also withdrew from the NWA by December 1987, and attempted to revive his [[Heart of America Sports Attractions]] as a national promotion known as World Wrestling Alliance, but would go out of business by 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hornbaker, Tim|title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling|publisher=ECW Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After WrestleMania III, Crockett also acquired the Universal Wrestling Federation—which broke from the NWA in 1986—and would also establish a second office in their old Dallas headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/jcp/jcp.htm Jim Crockett Promotions (1985-1989)]&lt;/ref&gt; To fight the WWF's control of the industry, JCP took the NWA's pay-per-view names and used its best talent to draw ratings. Crockett was unable to beat McMahon, who took big bites out of Jim Crockett Promotions by successfully airing the 1987 Survivor Series and 1988 Royal Rumble on the same nights as Starrcade 1987 and the 1988 Bunkhouse Stampede PPV cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellaonline.org/articles/art53968.asp The Royal Rumble - Wrestling]&lt;/ref&gt; This left him with no viable option other than selling out to media mogul [[Ted Turner]], who renamed the promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and continued to challenge McMahon's monopoly of the industry. Turner promised a more athletic approach to the product, making [[Ric Flair]] the promotion's marquee wrestler and giving young stars big storylines and championship opportunities.

=== Monday Night Wars (1995–2001) ===
{{Main|Monday Night Wars}}
[[File:Austinentrance.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] is often named the face of the [[Attitude Era]], during this time in the [[Monday Night Wars]] the WWE changed programming to be more teen-oriented]]
During the early 1990s, the growing WWF was being hindered by competing brands and nagging legal troubles. The largest troubles came from WCW, which competed for fans and dominated the industry during the years of 1997 to 1998. The WWF was forced to change itself to overcome its competition, remodeling itself with added bloodshed, violence, and more profane, sexually lewd characters. This new "Attitude Era" quickly dominated the style and nature of wrestling to become far more teen-oriented than ever before, and made the WWF regain its status as wrestling's top company.

The image of WCW changed when [[Eric Bischoff]] was appointed Executive Vice President of WCW in late 1993. He signed former WWF stars and departed from their focus on in-ring action in favor of the WWF's approach. The WWF began to suffer immediately and started building new stars. The Monday Night Wars began in 1995, when WCW started ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'', a show that ran directly against ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. While starting fairly even, the war escalated in 1996 with the formation of the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] stable, the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. They helped WCW gain the upper hand when they became the most powerful group in professional wrestling. WCW also came up with more legitimate, edgy storylines and characters over the WWF's cartoon style.

While the WWF and WCW rivalry was brewing a third promotion was growing in prominence. NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling renamed itself "[[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]" (ECW) and left the NWA. ECW adapted a [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore style]] of wrestling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Mick Foley|last=Foley|first=Mick|title=Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2000|isbn=0-06-103101-1|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it exposed the audience to levels of violence rarely seen in wrestling. The unorthodox style of moves, controversial storylines, and intense bloodthirst of ECW made it immensely popular among many wrestling fans in the 18-to-25-year-old demographic. Its intense fanbase, albeit a small constituency, reached near-cultism in the late 1990s and inspired the "hardcore style" in other wrestling promotions, namely WWF and WCW.

In 1998, the WWF gained momentum with the start of [[The Attitude Era]]. McMahon recast himself as the evil boss, known authoritatively as "Mr. McMahon". While an interesting character, it was McMahon's realistic feud with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] who had proven to be a huge money making draw for the company and become the company's most popular wrestler at the time that made the company finally dominate its competition.&lt;ref name=bishoff-pg273&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Eric Bischoff|last=Bischoff|first=Eric|title=Controversy Creates Cash|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was probably among the best of McMahon's storylines, and it came at a time when Bischoff was losing his vigor in WCW's affairs.&lt;ref name=bishoff-pg273/&gt; The WWF gained infamy for its more sexually explicit, profane, and violent characters. Austin was the top superstar in the company, portraying a foul mouthed beer swilling anti-hero who regularly defied his boss; [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] became a star for his cocky persona, his many catchphrases and attractive charisma; [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] gained popularity for enduring extreme pain, performing dangerous stunts renowned among the industry today; the stable [[D-Generation X]] was famous for its adult themes and established star, [[The Undertaker]], added to his fame because of his hardcore matches most notably with [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Mick Foley]], his gimmick which many consider to be the greatest in the history of professional wrestling and because of his overall dominance in the period in which he helped to put over new talent like [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and win 3 world championships in this era. Through the collective success of these characters, the company had finally refocused itself in the 18-25 demographic.

By the start of 1999, both shows were consistently getting ratings of 5.0 or higher, and over ten million people tuned in to ''Raw'' and ''Nitro'' every week. Wrestling continued to grow, as wrestlers made the mainstream media. From November 1998, the momentum was in the WWF's favor for the remainder of the Wars, with ''Raw'' dominating ''Nitro'' in the ratings. WCW continued its decline as their main eventers were in their 40s or pushing 40 and younger talent were never given the chance to be elevated to main event status. Their attempts at improving failed to turn the ratings tide, with ''Raw'' getting double the amount by 2000.

=== WWE's dominance (2001–present) ===
[[File:HHH after winning the WWE Undisputed Championship.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Triple H]] as the Undisputed WWF Champion, signifying the WWE's dominance in the industry]]
In 2001, the WWF (renamed "World Wrestling Entertainment" to avoid a trademark dispute with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] in 2002 and becoming simply "WWE" in 2011) became the dominant company in the global professional wrestling industry with the end of its two leading competitors, WCW and ECW. ECW was in dire financial straits earlier that year and Heyman filed for bankruptcy on April 4, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise &amp; Fall of ECW: Extreme Championship Wrestling|last=Loverro|first=Thom|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2006|isbn=1-4165-1058-3|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; WCW continued to lose more money and finally ended on March 23, 2001 with McMahon buying out the promotion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ringside: A History of Professional Wrestling in America|last=Beekman|first=Scott M.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-275-98401-X|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; after more than 15 years in business and being the biggest threat to the WWF to date. This left professional wrestling fans with no alternative to [[WWE programs|WWF programming]] and led to some leaving the [[fandom]].

With a demand remaining for [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Rasslin'|Southern-style]], [[Lucha Libre]], [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Strong Style|strong style]] and [[hardcore wrestling]] that WWE was not fulfilling, new promotions attempted to offer an alternative to cater to this [[niche market]]. The most successful among these have been [[Impact Wrestling]] (formerly Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) and [[Ring of Honor]], both starting up in 2002 and [[Lucha Underground]] starting in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Moraes|first1=Lisa|title=TCA: Mark Burnett To Launch Lucha Libre AAA League In U.S. With El Rey Network; ‘From Dusk Till Dawn’ To Premiere In March|url=http://deadline.com/2014/01/tca-mark-burnett-to-launch-lucha-libre-aaa-league-in-u-s-with-el-rey-network-662728/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other independent promotions like [[Chikara (professional wrestling)|Chikara Pro]], [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] and [[Pro Wrestling Guerrilla]] also began to gain more exposure.

As of 2018, the three top professional wrestling promotions in the United States are (in the following order): WWE, Impact Wrestling and Ring of Honor.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Controversies ===
The WWF was investigated by the Federal Government in 1991 for a steroid scandal where, reputedly, steroid use was rampant among wrestlers and in McMahon's [[World Bodybuilding Federation]]. Large names, including Hulk Hogan, gained infamy when news of their long-time steroid use was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pro Wrestling: From Carnivals to Cable TV|last=Greenberg|first=Keith Elliot|publisher=Lerner Publications|year=2000|isbn=0-8225-3332-4|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a civil lawsuit involving sexual misconduct on the part of [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] in 1992 further weakened the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wrestling Babylon: Piledriving Tales of Drugs, Sex, Death, and Scandal|last=Muchnick|first=Irvin|publisher=ECW Press|year=2007|isbn=1-55022-761-0|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gained great criticism to the WWF, weakening its once "family-oriented" programming.

[[WWE]] gained national media coverage in 2007 for the [[Chris Benoit double murder and suicide|Chris Benoit murder-suicide]], hypothesized to be related to brain damage resulting from multiple [[concussion]]s. This incident, along with the death of [[Eddie Guerrero]] in 2005, made drug use and young deaths in the business a subject of intense controversy. The wrestling industry and the nature of the business were widely criticized for this and WWE was affected on the business-side, with the company's stock losing approximately $15 million in market value in the first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessnews.com/_news/news_365390.php|title=World Wrestling Entertainment – the Chris Benoit communications breakdown|first=Howard|last=Bloom|date=2007-06-29|accessdate=2007-07-13|publisher=SportsBusinessNews|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810111959/http://www.sportsbusinessnews.com/_news/news_365390.php|archivedate=2007-08-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings also suffered for a short period, with ''Raw'' dropping 10% in total viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117968976.html|title=WWE in ratings decline|first=John|last=Dempsey|date=2007-07-22|accessdate=2007-07-22|publisher=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released on April 28, 2017, by [[WWE Studios]] and [[Blumhouse Productions|Blumhouse Tilt]].

==Plot==
A young street magician named Bo ([[Jacob Latimore]]) is left to care for his little sister after their parents' death and turns to illegal activities to keep a roof over their heads.

By day Bo performs magic tricks all over Los Angeles, with his specialty as being able to control anything metal, even float it in the air. He does this by building an electromagnet into his arm, with the negative electrode of the battery running to his thumb and the positive electrode running to his fingers. He first developed the electromagnet in high school for a science project, which earned him an engineering scholarship but he had to turn it down in order to take care of his sister after his mom died.

By night he sells drugs to pay the bills, seeing it as steady work with his supplier Angelo usually being a nice guy. However, things get ugly when a new kingpin comes in and starts selling drugs for cheaper on their turf. Angelo has Bo find this kingpin, so Bo uses his pickpocketing skills as a magician when he goes to a club, managed by one of Bo's friends, where the new kingpin has his dealers selling.

Bo asks one of the dealers for drugs and pickpockets his phone to look up his call history, and finds out that his supplier's name is Maurice. Angelo finds where Maurice lives, invades his house with Bo and forces Bo to chop off his hand.

Bo then gets in too deep when he tries to skim $15,000 off the money he makes from drug dealing so he and his sister can leave town. When Angelo finds out, he threatens to kill Bo unless he can come up with $45,000 in one week. Bo finds the money, but has to steal the last $9,000 from his friend the club owner by watching her unlock the safe when she invites him up to the main office; he pickpockets the office keys as they leave. He waits to have one last drink with his friend, feeling guilty for having stolen from her, yet relieved he may make it out of his predicament alive.

However, Maurice's gang is at the club at the same time. When they spot him, they knock him out, handcuff him and put him in the trunk of a car. Bo manages to escape by using his electromagnet to lift the latches on the handcuffs and trunk, but Maurice stole all his money.

When his sister is kidnapped by Angelo as ransom, he is forced to get back in touch with his old high school science teacher to get more power to his electromagnet. The teacher has an idea to add a feedback oscillator, but warns that it may cause the wires in his arm to overheat.

Bo then goes to Angelo's house with the supplemented electromagnet to find out where his sister is, where he rips out one of his ex-co-worker's gold teeth, hits the other with his own aluminum bat and then sends it flying into the wall. When Angelo goes to shoot him, he stops the bullets and causes the lights to flicker. He then drops the bullets to the floor, picks one up and slowly burrows it into Angelo's forehead to force him to divulge Bo's sister's whereabouts. After Angelo tells Bo that his sister is with his aunt, he releases the bullet from Angelo and gives him $15,000 before leaving.

Bo goes to pick her up with his arm burnt and they start a new life with Bo's girlfriend Holly in San Diego. As they are getting accustomed to their life, Bo still does street magic as his arm has now healed and Holly walks in on him in the bathroom late at night developing a new trick after waking up to all the lights in the house flickering.

'''''Sondheim on Sondheim''''' is a musical [[revue]] consisting of music and lyrics written by [[Stephen Sondheim]] for his many shows.  It is conceived and directed by [[James Lapine]].  The revue had a limited run on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2010.

==Background==
The revue is based on a show titled ''Moving On'' devised by [[David Kernan]], and produced in 2000 (Kernan also conceived ''[[Side By Side By Sondheim]]''). ''Moving On'' ran at The Bridwell Theatre, London, for 32 performances from July 19 to August 19, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheimguide.com/concerts2.html#Moving "'Moving On' listing, 2000"] sondheimguide.com, retrieved August 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The show featured some narration recorded by Sondheim; a CD of the show was released but did not include the Sondheim narrations. In 2001, ''Moving On'' premiered in the U.S. at The Laguna Playhouse in California. David Kernan, repeated his roles as conceiver and director. Three Sondheim vets, Teri Ralston (''[[Company (musical)|Company]]''), [[Ann Morrison]] (''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'') and David Engel (''[[Putting It Together]]''), lead the revue with Christopher Carothers and Tami Tappan also in the cast.&lt;ref&gt;Ehren, Christine [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/sondheim-revue-moving-on-makes-u.s.-debut-at-laguna-playhouse-oct.-30-dec.--99436 "Sondheim Revue ''Moving On'' Makes U.S. Debut at Laguna Playhouse Oct. 30-Dec. 2"] Playbill.com, October 30, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under a new title, ''Opening Doors'', the show had several performances in New York at [[Carnegie Hall]]'s Zankel Hall in September and October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheimguide.com/concerts3.html#Opening "'Opening Doors' listing, 2004] sondheimguide.com, retrieved August 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.

Lapine conceived a version of the revue in 2008, titled ''iSondheim: aMusical Revue'', to help celebrate the 40th anniversary of [[Alliance Theatre]] company in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].  This was structured as a multimedia revue, incorporating "original and archival commentary" from Sondheim.  The revue was promoted as taking audience members "to the very heart of Sondheim's life and work."&lt;ref&gt;Hetrick, Adam.

Sondheim wrote a new song for this revue, titled ''God'', a "self-deprecating comic song" sung by the company to open Act 2.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.

==Response==
The show met with mixed reviews. Most critics were in agreement that the video footage of Sondheim was the highlight of the show, that the technical aspects of the show were expertly handled and that some performances were good (notably Cook, Williams and the supporting cast). Negative reviewers tended to feel that the show was not as substantial as it could have been, that some material was poorly chosen or ill-matched to the performers, and that some performances were not successful (notably Wopat).&lt;ref&gt;Fick, David.[http://musicalcyberspace.wordpress.com/2010/04/24/review-roundup-sondheim-on-sondheim/ "REVIEW ROUNDUP: SONDHEIM ON SONDHEIM"] Musical Cyberspace, April 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Brantley]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the revue is "a genial, multimedia commemorative scrapbook on the life, times and career" of Sondheim, with "a polished and likable eight-member cast."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.

A '''taxi dancer''' is a paid dance partner in a [[partner dance]]. Taxi dancers are hired to dance with their customers on a dance-by-dance basis. When taxi dancing first appeared in [[Taxi dance hall|taxi-dance halls]] during the early 20th century in the United States, male patrons would typically buy dance tickets for a small sum each.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 3, 11, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BurgessCressey&gt;{{cite book|first=Ernest |last=Burgess| chapter=Introduction | pages=xxviii |title=The Taxi-Dance Hall:A Sociological Study in Commercialized Recreation and City Life |location= Montclair,NJ | publisher= Paterson Smith Publishing |year=1969|isbn=0875850766}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeland (2009), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;  
When a patron presented a ticket to a chosen taxi dancer, she would dance with him for the length of a single song. The taxi dancers would earn a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] on every dance ticket earned. Though taxi dancing has for the most part disappeared in the United States, it is still practiced in some other countries.

==Etymology==
The term "taxi dancer" comes from the fact that, as with a [[taxicab|taxi-cab]] driver, the dancer's pay is proportional to the time he or she spends dancing with the customer. Patrons in a [[Taxi dance hall|taxi-dance hall]] typically purchased dance tickets for ten cents each, which gave rise to the term "dime-a-dance girl". Other names for a taxi dancer are "dance hostess", "taxi" (in Argentina), and "nickel hopper" because out of that dime they typically earned five cents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==History==
{{Main|Taxi dance hall}}

[[File:Taxi Dancer lobby card.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Lobby card for ''[[The Taxi Dancer]]'' (1927)]]

Taxi dancing traces its origins to the [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco|Barbary Coast]] district of [[San Francisco]] which evolved from the [[California Gold Rush|California Gold Rush of 1849]]. In its heyday the Barbary Coast was an economically thriving place of mostly men that was frequented by gold prospectors and sailors from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury (1933), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; That district created a unique form of dance hall called the ''Barbary Coast dance hall'', also known as the ''Forty-Nine['49] dance hall''. Within a Barbary Coast dance hall female employees danced with male patrons, and earned their living from commissions paid for by the drinks they could encourage their male dance partners to buy.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;    

Still later after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|San Francisco Earthquake of 1906]] and during early days of [[jazz]] music, a new entertainment district developed in San Francisco and was nicknamed [[Terrific Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Knowles (1954), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asbury (1933), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stoddard (1982), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; And within that district an innovative dance hall, ''The So Different Club'', implemented a system where customers could buy a token which entitled them to one dance with a female employee.&lt;ref&gt;Stoddard (1982), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Richards1&gt;{{cite book| first=Rand| last=Richards | title=Historic Walks in San Francisco|  pages= 183 | location= San Francisco | publisher=Heritage House Publishers| year=2002 | isbn= 1879367033  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since dancing had become a popular pastime, many of The So Different Club's patrons would go there to see and learn the latest new dances.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury (1933), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However in 1913 San Francisco enacted new laws that would forbid dancing in any cafe or saloon where alcohol was served.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury (1933), p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; The closure of the dance halls on Terrific Street fostered a new kind of pay-to-dance scheme, called a ''closed dance hall'', which did not serve alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; That name was derived from the fact that female customers were not allowed — the only women permitted in these halls were the dancing female employees.&lt;ref&gt;Report of Public Dance Hall Committee of San Francisco of California Civic League of Women Voters, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; The closed dance hall introduced the ''ticket-a-dance'' system which became the centerpiece of the taxi-dance hall business model.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; A taxi dancer would earn her income by the number of tickets she could collect in exchange for dances. 

Taxi dancing then spread to [[Chicago]] where dance academies, which were struggling to survive, began to adopt the ticket-a-dance system for their students.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The first instance of the ticket-a-dance system in Chicago occurred at Mader-Johnson Dance Studios. The dance studio's owner, Godfrey Johnson, describes his innovation:
{{blockquote|I was in New York during the summer of 1919, and while there visited a new studio opened by Mr. W___ W___ of San Francisco, where he had introduced a ten-cent-ticket-a-dance plan. When I got home I kept thinking of that plan as a way to get my advanced students to come back more often and to have experience dancing with different instructors. So I decided to put a ten-cent-a-lesson system in the big hall on the third floor of my building... But I soon noticed that it wasn't my former pupils who were coming up to dance, but a rough hoodlum element from Clark Street... Things went from bad to worse; I did the best I could to keep the hoodlums in check.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This system was so popular at dance academies, that taxi dancing quickly spread to an increasing number of non-instructional taxi-dance halls. 

Taxi dancers typically received half of the ticket price as salary and the other half paid for the orchestra, dance hall, and operating expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they only worked a few hours a night, they frequently made two to three times the salary of a woman working in a factory or a store.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the taxi-dance hall surpassed the public ballroom in becoming the most popular place for urban dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxi-dance halls flourished in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s, as scores of taxi-dance halls opened in Chicago, New York, and other major cities. In 1931 there were over 100 taxi-dance halls in New York City, and between 35,000 and 50,000 men would go to these halls every week.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald VanderKooi, University of Illinois at Chicago Circle,  March 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeland (2009), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However by the mid 1920s, the taxi-dance halls were coming under attack by reform movements that insisted on licensing and police supervision, and they succeeded in closing down some taxi-dance halls for lewd behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Freeland (2009), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; And in San Francisco where it all started, the police commission ruled against the employment of women as taxi dancers in 1921, and taxi dancing in San Francisco would forever become illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]] the popularity of taxi dancing in the United States began to diminish, and most of its taxi-dance halls disappeared by the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Clyde Vedder: ''Decline of the Taxi-Dance Hall'', Sociology and Social Research, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul G. Cressey's book, entitled ''The Taxi-Dance Hall: A Sociological Study in Commercialized Recreation and City Life'', gives a history of taxi dance halls, with interviews with taxi dancers and patrons. Various films and novels chronicled the lives of taxi dancers. For example, in 1927 [[Joan Crawford]] starred in the film ''[[The Taxi Dancer]]'', and actor [[Ed Wynn]] starred in the [[Ziegfeld]] Broadway [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Simple Simon (musical)|Simple Simon]]'', which popularized the song "[[Ten Cents a Dance]]", which in turn inspired the 1931 film [[Ten Cents a Dance (1931 film)|''Ten Cents a Dance'']], starring [[Barbara Stanwyck]].

==Taxi dancers today==

Taxi dancers may dance among paying customers to raise the standard or dance among the beginners to encourage them to continue learning. In the latter situation, taxi dancers often provide their services, without pay, with the general goal of building the dance community.

In social settings and social forms of dance, a partner wanting constructive feedback from a taxi dancer must explicitly request it. As the taxi dancer's role is primarily social, she is unlikely to criticize her partner directly. Due to the increased profile of partner dances during the 2000s, taxi dancing has become more common in settings where partners are in short supply, involving male and female dancers. For example, male dancers are often employed on [[cruise ship]]s to dance with single female passengers. This is usually called [[Cruise ship dance host|Dance Host]]. Taxi dancers (male and female) are also available for hire in Vienna, Austria, where dozens of formal balls are held each year.

Volunteer taxi dancers (experienced male and female dancers) are used in [[dance]] styles such as [[Ceroc]] to help beginners.

===In the United States ===
Paying to dance with a female employee is available in some nightclubs of the United States, including many in [[Los Angeles]]. These clubs no longer use the ticket-a-dance system, but have [[Time clock|time-clocks]] and [[Time card|punch-cards]] that allow the patron to pay for the dancer's time by the hour. Some of these modern dance clubs operate in buildings where taxi dancing was done in the early 20th century. No longer called taxi-dance halls, these latter-day establishments are now called [[hostess club]]s.&lt;ref name="stranger"&gt;Evan Wright, [http://www.laweekly.com/news/dance-with-a-stranger-2130263 "Dance With A Stranger"], ''LA Weekly'', January 20, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

For official purposes, in the United States their occupation was sometimes referred to as a 'dancer', when they worked in taxi-dance halls that had all the necessary [[business permit]]s. But there were some professional secretaries who were moonlighting and legally worked part-time as a dancer.

===In Argentina===
The growth of [[tango]] tourism in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], has led to an increase in formal and informal taxi dancing services in the [[Milonga (place)|''milongas'']], or dance halls. While some operators are trying to sell holiday romance, reputable tango taxi agencies offer genuine services to tourists who find it hard to cope with the ''cabeceo''—eye contact and nodding—method of finding a dance partner.

'''Telstra Media''' (formerly known as '''BigPond''') is an Australian [[Internet service provider]] and a [[product (business)|product]] of [[Telstra]]. It is Australia's largest&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=JUlX2l7vkr4C&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Telstra+Media+(formerly+known+as+BigPond)+is+an+Australian+Internet+service+provider+and+a+product+of+Telstra.+It+is+Australia's+largest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Sn78kqrS5q&amp;sig=zZNImT3jCTG4afGczVqw6gKzEqk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi69c_xjrbZAhUHLpQKHRB5BigQ6AEIngEwDw#v=onepage&amp;q=Telstra%20Media%20(formerly%20known%20as%20BigPond)%20is%20an%20Australian%20Internet%20service%20provider%20and%20a%20product%20of%20Telstra.%20It%20is%20Australia's%20largest&amp;f=false|title=42 Rules of Product Management (2nd Edition)|last=Lawley|first=Brian|date=2012|publisher=Happy About|isbn=9781607730910|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} ISP and is based in [[Melbourne]]. The BigPond brand has been in the process of being phased out in favour of full Telstra branding since 2013. As of May 2016, BigPond Movies is the only remaining service using BigPond branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.itnews.com.au/news/telstra-hits-another-nail-in-bigpond-coffin-419710 | title = Telstra hits another nail in BigPond coffin | last = Coyne | first = Allie | publisher = IT News | date = 18 May 2016 | accessdate = 18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==

Note that the remainder of the article has not been changed to reflect the name change from BigPond to Telstra Media.

Telstra Media offers five types of Internet access;

*'''Cable''' – BigPond is Australia's largest provider of [[Cable Internet access]], which covers parts of Australia's main cities ([[Adelaide]], [[Brisbane]], [[Melbourne]], [[Perth]], [[Sydney]], and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]). Speeds available are 'Turbo' (8 Mbit/s [[downstream (networking)|downstream]], 128 kbit/s [[upstream (networking)|upstream]]), 'Elite' (30 Mbit/s down, 1 Mbit/s up) and 'Ultimate' (100 Mbit/s down, 2 Mbit/s up).
*'''ADSL''' – BigPond provides both [[ADSL]] and [[ADSL2+]] services where available, with speeds ranging from 256 kbit/s down/64 kbit/s up to 20 Mbit/s down/1 Mbit/s up. The current speeds available on ADSL plans that BigPond offers are "up to" 1.5 Mbit/s down/256 kbit/s up, "up to" 8 Mbit/s down/384 kbit/s up and "up to" 20 Mbit/s down/1 Mbit/s up.
:'''Naked DSL''' – A six-week trial of two kinds of naked DSL to "assess customer demand" was launched on 1 June 2010. 'Pure DSL' having the ability to receive incoming calls and make emergency calls, and 'Naked DSL' being offered without a dial tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/telstra-bigpond-trials-naked-dsl-339303582.htm |title=Telstra BigPond trials naked DSL |publisher=Ben Grubb, ZDNet.com.au |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2010-06-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100604030756/http://www.zdnet.com.au/telstra-bigpond-trials-naked-dsl-339303582.htm| archivedate= 4 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Mobile Broadband''' – Through Telstra's [[Telstra Mobile|Next G]] network, BigPond provides the largest wireless network coverage in Australia, reaching 99% of the population.&lt;ref name="nextgcoverage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telstra.com.au/mobile/networks/coverage/broadband.html|title=Mobile Broadband Coverage|publisher=Telstra|accessdate=19 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100123084303/http://www.telstra.com.au/mobile/networks/coverage/broadband.html| archivedate= 23 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Download speeds on the 3G network range from 256 kbit/s to 3.5 Mbit/s in regional and interurban areas, and "up to" 21 Mbit/s in metropolitan and city areas. Download speeds on the 4G Network are "up to" 40Mbit/s. BigPond also provides wireless '[[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hot spots]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telstra.com.au/wirelesshotspots/index.htm |title=Telstra Wireless Hotspots |publisher=Telstra.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091228021456/http://www.telstra.com.au/wirelesshotspots/index.htm| archivedate= 28 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Satellite''' – Bigpond provides Satellite internet mainly for regional customers who are too far away from the exchange to get ADSL, and cannot get Cable. Satellite is delivered via 2-way Satellite with speeds ranging from 256 kbit/s down/64 kbit/s up to 800 kbit/s down/128 kbit/s up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.bigpond.com/internetplans/broadband/satellite/2_way_plans/default.jsp |title=Satellite plans and pricing |publisher=My.bigpond.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228170107/http://my.bigpond.com:80/internetplans/broadband/satellite/2_way_plans/default.jsp |archivedate=28 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dialup''' – BigPond has moved customers off dialup to a broadband platform, and in 2006 its broadband customers surpassed the number of dialup customers.

==Customer service==

In 2007 a survey of 14,000 people by ''[[PC Authority]]'' magazine found BigPond users rated poorly for customer service, and less than a third considered their service a value for the money. However, BigPond argued that the survey's structure had encouraged people to provide extreme opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/telstras-bigpond-bombs-out-with-users/story-e6frfrnr-1111115054198?from=mostpop|title=Telstra's BigPond bombs out with consumers|last=Ramadge|first=A|date=7 December 2007|publisher=News.com.au|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) reported 14,692 complaints against Telstra BigPond for the period 1 January 2009 – 31 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tio.com.au/statisticsByMember.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521174253/http://www.tio.com.au/statisticsByMember.htm |date=21 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflected 47.5% of all complaints against all internet service providers reported to the TIO in Australia in that period. Customer Service, Complaints Handling, Faults &amp; Provision accounted for 8,103 complaints in that period.

BigPond uses offshore call centres to provide most of their technical support. The Technical Support 133933 number connects through a VoIP line to support staff based in The Philippines, by call centre outsource companies, TeleTech &amp; Teleperformance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/small-business/telstra-jobs-head-to-philippines-20090619-cqoj.html|title=Telstra jobs head to Philippines|last=Schneiders|first=Ben|date=10 October 2008|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical Support officers have limited ability to resolve issues and cannot refer any issue to a Complaint Handling Officer or Customer Advocate. If the support call relates to network issues the Technical Support team cannot take any action to resolve the problem.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In November 2009 Telstra chief executive [[David Thodey]] promised a "new Telstra" which will be much more responsive to its customers in a bid to improve the telco's corporate reputation, stating that the new mantra at Telstra would be "customer service, customer service, customer service", and announcing increases in speed and data allowances for BigPond customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/ets-pushes-telstra-issue-to-parliamentary-backburner/story-e6frg8zx-1225804353385|title= ETS pushes Telstra issue to parliamentary backburner |last=Korporaal|first=Glenda|date=27 November 2009|work=The Australian|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==

===BigPond Music===

BigPond operated a music download store, offering 15 million tracks encoded at either 256kbit/s or 320kbit/s in MP3 format.

In April 2012, [[MOG (online music)|MOG]] announced a partnership with Telstra to bring MOG to Australia, the first region outside of the US to have access.&lt;ref&gt;http://exchange.telstra.com.au/2012/04/17/mog-powered-by-telstra-a-massive-deal-for-music-lovers/&lt;/ref&gt; Telstra and MOG launched under the BigPond Music branding on 21 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.mog.com/post.php?num%3D638184929 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629013437/http://blog.mog.com/post.php?num=638184929 |archivedate=29 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BigPond Music service ended in late 2014.

===BigPond Games and GameArena===
GameArena was a website dedicated to [[video gaming]] operating under the BigPond brand that was managed by Mammoth Media and based on the east coast of Australia. The site provided news, downloads and servers primarily for the [[Personal computer|PC]], and [[Macintosh|Mac]], though it later branched out to include console sites. GameArena provided an online game shop GameNow, which sported various benefits to Telstra customers.&lt;ref name="shop2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/4702/127/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314191225/http://www.itwire.com:80/content/view/4702/127/ |archivedate=14 March 2008 |df=dmy }} ITWire article on GameNow&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the GameArena file library, gaming servers and booking service were freely available to anyone, but provided specific advantages to Telstra customers such as preference in downloads and unmetered usage, as well as various bonuses in competitions. In 2005, GameArena went through a new shift with the merging of GameNow and Gameshop into itself. The name became simply BigPond GameArena.&lt;ref name="shop"&gt;http://pcworld.idg.com.au/index.php?id=976973335 PC World GameArena article&lt;/ref&gt;

GameArena once operated over 100 gaming servers, which were monitored by a volunteer force of administrators, known as GameOps. ''GameCreate'' was a service offered free of charge where users may book a server for a specific game for a 2-hour period of time. This server was private and could be used for either ladder training or social events.&lt;ref name="servers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamearena.com.au/getconnected/servers/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203652/http://www.gamearena.com.au/getconnected/servers/ |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }} GameArena list of servers&lt;/ref&gt;

GameArena servers and its website closed on 20 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mcvpacific.com/news/read/telstra-confirms-it-is-closing-game-arena/0138403 | title = Telstra confirms it is closing Game Arena | date = 2014-09-16 | accessdate = 2015-06-30 | publisher = MCV Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pond in ''Second Life''===
Telstra BigPond owned and operated a number of virtual islands in the online game ''[[Second Life]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.bigpond.com/pond/secondlife |title=The Pond on Second Life |publisher=My.bigpond.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for approximately three years. BigPond closed its ''Second Life'' presence in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/bigpond-pulls-plug-on-second-life-20091117-ijq2.html |first=Louisa | last=Hearn |title=BigPond pulls plug on Second Life |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=2009-11-17 |accessdate=2010-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100120164824/http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/bigpond-pulls-plug-on-second-life-20091117-ijq2.html| archivedate= 20 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series overview==
''The Affair'' explores the emotional effects of an extramarital relationship between Noah Solloway and Alison Lockhart ([[Dominic West]] and [[Ruth Wilson]]) after they casually meet at the diner where Alison works. The show begins with the Solloway family packing up the family van to stay in the resort town of [[Montauk, New York]]. Noah is happily married with four children, but he resents their dependence on his wealthy father-in-law. Alison is a local waitress trying to piece her life and marriage back together in the wake of her young son's tragic accidental death at the age of four. The story of the affair is depicted from Noah's and Alison's perspectives respectively, complete with memory bias which often results in vastly different scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2014/08/26/showtime-releases-key-art-for-the-affair-premiering-sunday-october-12th-at-10-pm-et-pt-893100/20140826showtime03/ |title=Showtime(R) Releases Key Art for "The Affair," Premiering Sunday, October 12th at 10 PM ET/PT |publisher=Showtime |date=August 26, 2014 |accessdate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode has two parts, one as remembered by Noah, the other by Alison. Noah's perspective is of a vibrant, playful, and sexy Alison who comes on to him, while her perspective is more cautious, reserved, with a dulled conservative sense of self, and Noah coming on to her.

In the second season, the narrative is expanded to include the perspectives of Noah and Alison's original spouses, Helen Solloway and Cole Lockhart ([[Maura Tierney]] and [[Joshua Jackson]]), as they all move forward with the dissolution of their marriages and deal with the ramifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/11/affair-season-2-four-perspectives |title=''The Affair'' boss explains how season 2 will work with four perspectives |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Samantha |last=Highfill |date=August 11, 2015 |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent death of Alison's brother-in-law, Scott ([[Colin Donnell]]), and the ensuing police investigation and criminal trial, are explored in [[flashforward]] scenes at the end of most episodes.

The third season is set three years later, following the culmination of the flashforward trial scenes, after Noah is released from prison. Season 3 introduces an occasional perspective, Juliette Le Gall ([[Irène Jacob]]), Noah's new love interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/the-affair-season-three-new-character |title=''The Affair'' Unveils Game-Changing Season 3 Twist |work=Vanity Fair |first=Julie |last=Miller |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth season, Noah has moved to Los Angeles to be closer to his younger children Trevor (Jadon Sand) and Stacey (Abigail Dylan Harrison), as Helen and Vik ([[Omar Metwally]]) have moved there. Cole and Luisa ([[Catalina Sandino Moreno]]) are living together in Montauk, while Alison is working as a grief counselor. Season 4 features opening [[flashforward]] sequences, featuring Noah and Cole, in its first four episodes, which ultimately lead to the discovery of Alison's death.

The fifth season will take place in two different time frames: a present-day storyline including Noah, Helen, and their four children and the other decades later featuring a now-adult Joanie Lockhart ([[Anna Paquin]]) returning to Montauk to find out the truth about her mother's death.&lt;ref name="Season5Plot"/&gt;

'''''The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires''''' is a 1974 [[horror film]]/[[martial arts film]] produced by [[Hammer Film Productions]] and [[Shaw Brothers Studio]]. It is the ninth and final film in the Hammer ''Dracula'' series. It was released in the US by [[Dynamite Films]] in 1979 in a heavily edited version as '''''The 7 Brothers Meet Dracula''''', and was alternately known on the US trailer as '''''The 7 Brothers and their One Sister Meet Dracula'''''.&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt;  In the [[ Far East]], it was titled '''''Dracula and the 7 Golden Vampires'''''. The film is notable for having an actor other than [[Christopher Lee]] portray [[Count Dracula]] in the Hammer ''Dracula'' series; before this film was made, Lee had left the role of the Count. The role of Dracula is played by [[John Forbes-Robertson (actor)|John Forbes-Robertson]] (though the actor's voice is dubbed by [[David de Keyser]]).

==Storyline==

===Prologue===
In Transylvania in 1804, a lone figure makes his way through the countryside and into the towering Castle Dracula. He heads over to the tomb of the legendary vampire before summoning him. Soon, Count Dracula appears from his crypt and demands to know who has disturbed him. The figure announces, in his own language, that his name is Kah, a [[Taoism|Taoist]] monk and the High Priest of the Temple of the Seven Golden Vampires in rural China. He goes on to tell the Count that the Seven Golden Vampires' power is fading and he needs him to restore them to their former glory. Dracula considers the offer and accepts on one condition: that he takes on Kah's body and image to escape his castle, which has become his prison.

Despite Kah's pleas for mercy, the vampire takes hold of the monk in a cloud of unearthly mist and they are both subdued. When the mist clears, Kah speaks with the voice of Count Dracula, who then triumphantly leaves the tomb, bound for China...

===Plot===
In 1904 [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Van Helsing]] ([[Peter Cushing]]) gives a lecture at a [[Chongqing|Chungking]] university on Chinese [[vampire]] legends. He speaks of an unknown rural village that has been terrorised by a cult of seven known as the "Seven Golden Vampires" for many years. He goes on to explain that a simple farmer, armed with a pitchfork and who had lost his wife to the vampires, trekked his way to the temple of the vampires, where he saw many other unfortunate women strapped to tables, waiting for their blood to be drained. The farmer burst in and battled the vampires. He is unsuccessful as his wife is killed in the fight, but in the chaos, he grabbed a bat-like medallion from around one of the vampire's necks, which he sees as the vampires' life source. Defeated, the farmer flees the temple, but the High Priest orders the vampires after him. After they leave on horseback, the High Priest summons the vampire's former victims: the undead rise from their graves to aid the seven vampires. Still carrying the medallion, the farmer places it around a small model of a jade Buddha. He knocks desperately on the locked village gates, but it is in vain. The vampires and their undead catch up with him and kill him. One of the vampires spies the medallion around the Buddha and goes over to collect it. The moment the vampire touched the Buddha, the creature is destroyed in flames.

Van Helsing goes on to say that he is positive the village still exists and is still terrorised by the six remaining vampires. He is only unsure of where the village lies. Most students disapprove of the story and leave. Back in Van Helsing's rented house, a student named Hsi Ching ([[David Chiang]]) informs him that the legend is true and that he knows the location of the village. He goes on to say that the farmer from the story was his grandfather. He proves it by producing the dead vampire's bat-like medallion. He then asks Van Helsing if he would be willing to travel to the village and destroy the vampire menace. Van Helsing agrees and embarks with his son Leyland ([[Robin Stewart]]), Hsi Ching, and his seven kung fu trained siblings on a dangerous journey, funded by a wealthy widow named Vanessa Buren ([[Julie Ege]]), who Leyland and two of Ching's siblings saved from an attack by the tongs.

On the journey, they are ambushed by three of the six remaining vampires in a cave along with the undead. The group are quickly engaged in battle and soon kill the three vampires. The remaining three, sensing that they are outnumbered, are quick to retreat, taking their army of undead with them. The following morning, the party reach the village, partly ruined but still populated, and prepare to make their final stand. They use wooden stakes as barriers and dig a large trench around them filled with flammable liquid. In the temple that evening, Kah calls on the remaining vampires to kill Van Helsing and his party once and for all. The vampires ride on horseback, followed by their army of undead, to the village.

The vampires reach the village, and soon, Van Helsing's group once again do battle with the last of the golden vampires and their undead, resulting in nearly all their party and the villagers being massacred. During the fight, Vanessa is bitten by one of the vampires and she quickly becomes one herself. She then seduces Ching and bites his neck. Knowing what he will become and what he has to do, Ching throws himself and Vanessa onto a wooden stake, impaling them both. Elsewhere, the last remaining vampire captures Mai Kwei ([[Shih Szu]]), Ching's sister, and takes her back to the temple to be drained of her blood. Seeing this, Leyland steals a horse from one of the dead vampires and pursues. The undead defeated, Van Helsing and his remaining party follow to help Leyland at the temple.

Having reached the temple, the vampire straps Mai Kwei to one of the altars. It is about to drain her blood when Leyland leaps onto the creature's back and throws it to the ground, before freeing the sister. The vampire comes around and attacks Leyland, throwing him onto one of the altars in the struggle. Leyland is about to be drained when Van Helsing and his group burst in. Van Helsing thrusts a spear into the vampire's back, impaling it. Dying, the last of the golden vampires stumbles and collapses into a vat of boiling blood, where it quickly evaporates, leaving behind the bat-like medallion, its mask and a pile of dried blood and red dust.

The survivors depart from the temple, save for Van Helsing, who feels a familiar atmosphere. Sure enough, a familiar voice bellows from behind him. Van Helsing turns around to face Kah the High Priest. Recognizing the voice, Van Helsing realises that Dracula has been using the form of the monk to control the seven golden vampires and their undead. Van Helsing demands Dracula to show himself, calling him a coward. Dracula reverts to his true form and attacks Van Helsing. In the ensuing struggle, Van Helsing succeeds in stabbing Dracula with a spear through the heart. Defeated, the Count collapses onto one of the altars and gradually decays to bones. The spear that killed him collapses, smashing the vampire's skull. Soon, there is nothing left of the Count, save for his dusty remains and the blood-stained spear.

==Production==
Both [[Roy Ward Baker]], a British director who had helmed several previous Hammer films, and [[Chang Cheh]], a veteran Hong Kong action director, worked on the movie, though only Baker is credited. He took over the making of the film after [[Gordon Hessler]] left it weeks before. Filming was hard, as both Chinese and British crews had to work together despite the language barrier.

''The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires'' was a co-production with Hong Kong's [[Shaw Brothers Studio]], made in the hope of garnering some of the [[kung fu (term)|kung fu]] movie market share. [[Michael Carreras]] later said this "wasn't such a good idea" although he felt "some of the film is quite good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|website=Fangoria|page=57|url=https://archive.org/stream/Fangoria_110_1992_Hellraider_3_DaveWooderson-DREGS_c2c#page/n58/mode/1up/search/%22nat+cohen%22+|date=1992|first=Steve|last=Swires|title=Fall of the House of Hammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie was released with various titles in different locations, including ''The 7 Brothers Meet Dracula'' in the US and ''Dracula and the 7 Golden Vampires'' in the Far East. During some scenes involving roving gangs of undead, several vampires can be seen hopping up and down, as vampires tend to do in Chinese vampire films.

The US version trims twenty minutes of the film's footage and soundtrack and loops several remaining scenes to fill the running time.&lt;ref name="Chandler" /&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical===
Critical reaction to the film has been mixed. Keith Phipps of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' called the film "flawed" but "enjoyable," adding, "It's pretty much as ridiculous as it sounds, but there's something inherently entertaining about make-up-splattered vampires, distinguished British actors, and martial artists squaring off in periodic eruptions of kung-fu fighting."&lt;ref name="Phipps" /&gt;

Phil Chandler of ''DVD Cult'' wrote, "Is it the best Hammer horror film ever made? Hell no. Is it the best Hammer film of the seventies? Hell yeah."&lt;ref name="Chandler" /&gt;

Graeme Clark of ''The Spinning Image'' said, "Cushing, in his last Hammer Dracula film, is as commanding as ever, but he and his Western companions are pretty disposable to the plot until the end, where the professor is left alone with the Count, who is hardly needed. Nevertheless, this last Hammer vampire outing has a real energy, in spite of being a mishmash, and is different enough to get by on sheer novelty alone."&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia'', academic [[Peter Dendle]] called the raising of the undead army "one of the most visually spectacular in zombie cinema".&lt;ref name=dendle/&gt;  Glenn Kay, who wrote ''[[Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide]]'', called the film "boisterous, action-packed, and very likeable".&lt;ref name=kay/&gt;
===Box Office===
The film was not a box office success. There was a planned sequel, ''Kali: The Devil Bride of Dracula'' to be shot in India but it was not made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|website=Fangoria|page=57|url=https://archive.org/stream/Fangoria_110_1992_Hellraider_3_DaveWooderson-DREGS_c2c#page/n58/mode/1up/search/%22nat+cohen%22+|date=1992|first=Steve|last=Swires|title=Fall of the House of Hammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
The US DVD from [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] features both the edited ''The 7 Brothers Meet Dracula'' version, as well as the original unedited ''The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires'' version.&lt;ref name="Chandler" /&gt; The DVD also features a recording of Peter Cushing telling the story of the film with music and sound effects, which was released as an [[LP record]] at the time of the film's release.&lt;ref name="Chandler" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.blu-ray.com/The-Legend-of-the-7-Golden-Vampires/188240/#Overview&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sound of Laughter''''' was British comedian [[Peter Kay]]'s initial volume of [[autobiography]], released on 5 October 2006. The book was a bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Wainwright|title=True North: In Praise of England's Better Half|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hb-SE9Ra7IC&amp;pg=PT244|date=5 June 2012|publisher=Guardian Books|isbn=978-0-85265-369-2|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sound of Laughter'' was a success with 278,000 copies sold in its first day (including pre-orders). It went straight in at Number 1 on both the [[Play.com]] and [[Amazon.co.uk]] book charts and was the Number 1 highest selling autobiography in the UK.

==Cover==

The cover of the book features Kay's head on [[Julie Andrews]]' body from ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. The raised effect on the head is supposed to look as if it has been cut out and stuck on, which ties in with the homely feel of the book.

==Promotion==

Kay has only done one promotional appearance for the book on ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]''. On the show, Kay came on dressed as a nun, with a mask of his face over his ordinary face - a parody of the cover of the book. In the interview he criticised [[Billy Connolly]]'s biography, ''[[Billy (book)|Billy]]'', as well as making numerous jokes about his education by nuns. He said he had many nuns teaching him:

*[[Sister Sledge]]
*[[Scissor Sisters|Sister Scissors]]
*[[Sister Act 2]]
*[[Systematic (band)|Sister Matic]]
*[[Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves|Sister Zar Doin-it]]
*[[Swing Out Sister|Sister Swingout]]
*[[Sisters of Mercy|Sister O'Mercy]]

He added that every year, he sent a Valentine's card to each nun from Jesus.

==Follow up book==
It was announced by Kay at [[Jason Manford]]'s stand-up gig in [[City of Salford|Salford]], that he would be releasing another book to follow on from ''The Sound of Laughter''. This was later confirmed by Random House and '''''Saturday Night Peter''''' was released in Autumn 2009.

[[file:Will-Hay.jpg|thumb|Hay in ''[[The Ghost of St. Michael's]]'' (1941)]]

'''William Thomson Hay''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|FRAS}} (6 December 1888 – 18 April 1949) was an English comedian, actor, author, film director and amateur astronomer who came to notice for his theatrical sketch as a jocular schoolmaster, known as Dr. Muffin.  The acts in which Hay performed the schoolmaster sketch became known as "The Fourth Form at St. Michael's". Hay toured with the act and appeared in the United States, Canada, Australia and South Africa. He famously performed the schoolmaster routine at the 1925 Royal Command Performance before [[George V of England|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].&lt;ref name="ajhw.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajhw.co.uk/books/book136/book136.html |title=The Fourth Form At St. Michaels Will Hay &amp; His Scholars |website=A.J.H. Computer Services |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1934 to 1943, he was a prolific film star in Britain and was ranked the third highest grossing star at the British Box Office in 1938, behind [[George Formby]] and [[Gracie Fields]]. He is widely regarded as one of the most prolific and influential British comedians of all-time.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt;

Hay worked with [[Gainsborough Pictures]] from 1935 to 1940, during which time he developed a partnership with [[Graham Moffatt]], playing an insolent overweight schoolboy, and [[Moore Marriott]] as a toothless old man. Hay's 1937 film, with Moffatt and Marriott, ''[[Oh, Mr. Porter!]]'' was credited by ''[[The Times]]'' as being "a comic masterpiece of the British cinema",&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 16 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; while the writer [[Jimmy Perry]] cited the film as an influence on key character development for ''[[Dad's Army]]''.&lt;ref name="jimmyperry"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jimmy-perry-obituary-creator-of-much-loved-sitcom-dads-army-a7377946.html |title=Jimmy Perry obituary: Creator of Dad's Army who used his own life experiences in much-loved sitcom |publisher=The Independent |date=24 October 2016 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hay often portrayed  incompetent authority figures who attempt to conceal their incompetence but whose true traits are gradually exposed. As well as being incompetent, his characters are often immoral; for example, a vicar involved in horse betting in ''[[Dandy Dick]]'', a fraudster who lies about his career as a distinguished sea captain in ''[[Windbag the Sailor]]'', and a prison warden, [[Dr Benjamin Twist]], in ''[[Convict 99]]'', who obtains his job under false pretenses.&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05qdw88 |title=The Essay, British Film Comedians: Will Hay |publisher=BBC Radio 3 |date=13 April 2015 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is often compared to [[W. C. Fields]], who typically portrayed characters similar to those of Hay, being misanthropic, self-centered scoundrels who nevertheless remain sympathetic.&lt;ref name="lostmaster"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/4270299/Will-Hay-the-lost-master-of-British-comedy.html |title=Will Hay: the lost master of British comedy |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 January 2009 |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hay was also an amateur astronomer, and in 1933 gained fame for discovering a [[Great White Spot]] on [[Saturn]]. He built his own observatory and was a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]].

==Early life==
Hay was born at 23 Durham Street in [[Stockton-on-Tees]], [[County Durham]], England, to William Robert Hay (1851–1920) and his wife, Elizabeth (1859–1910) (née Ebden). Hay had a brother and three sisters. When Hay was less than a year old the family moved to [[Suffolk]].&lt;ref&gt;1891 UK census: RG12/1494 f.56 p.47 &amp; p.48 – 192 Clapham Road, [[Lowestoft]], Suffolk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Births: MAR 1889 10a 49 STOCKTON – William Thomson Hay&lt;/ref&gt; William Hay Snr's career as an engineer required the family to move frequently; firstly to [[Hemel Hempstead]]; then to London; and finally to [[Manchester]], where his father established an engineering company.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} By his late teens, Hay Jnr. had become fluent in Italian, French and German and secured employment as an interpreter.&lt;ref name="reglegend1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/25/feature_will_hay_british_comedy_legend/ |title=Will Hay: Britain's bumbling star of the screen and skies. Page 1. |publisher=[[The Register]] |date=25 May 2015 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early career===
Hay decided to become an actor when he was 21 after watching [[W. C. Fields]] perform a juggling act in [[Manchester]]. In the early years of the twentieth century Hay experienced some moderate success as a stand-up comedian and an after dinner speaker.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heritage.stockton.gov.uk/people/will-hay-3/ |title=Will Hay |publisher=Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council |accessdate=12 Sep 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hay's first contract came when he was offered a contract to perform at a theatre in [[Belper]].&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt; He first performed his schoolmaster character in 1910 which he based upon a colleague of his sister, who was a teaching mistress.&lt;ref name="reglegend1"/&gt; The characterisation was initially  performed in drag as a schoolmistress, but he transferred the character to a headmaster.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a67M2nouJfA |title=Will Hay – Master of Comedy |website=YouTube |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=2 June 1976 |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 Hay began working with the impresario [[Fred Karno]] who had previously helped [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]] achieve success.  Hay worked with Karno for four years.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt;

Hay's schoolmaster sketches, known as "the fourth form at St Michaels", were popular in the 1920s, and he toured with them around the world. He enjoyed particular success in South Africa, Canada and the USA. His wife, Gladys, often played a schoolboy or the character Harbottle in his sketches. The Harbottle character was one of the most popular in Hay's act, a dim-witted, nearly deaf old man who is still in school because he's so backward.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt; The character later featured in Hay's films portrayed by [[Moore Marriott]]. In a 1976 interview, [[Val Guest]] who served as a screenwriter for many of Hay's films, recalled transposing Harbottle from school into other everyday situations.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt;

Hay performed the schoolmaster routine at the 1925 Royal Command Performance before [[George V of England|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. This was widely regarded as one of his most famous performances.&lt;ref name="ajhw.co.uk"/&gt;

Hay published a magazine piece entitled ''Philosophy of Laughter'', in which he discussed the psychology of comedy. In the essay he rhetorically asks, "Why does every one of us laugh at seeing somebody else slapped in the face with a large piece of cold custard pie? Is it because we're all naturally cruel? Or is it because there's something inherently funny in custard pies? Or in faces? Or in throwing things? No. No. and no! The real reason why we laugh is because we are relieved. Because we are released from a sense of fear. Wherever we may happen to be – in the cinema, theatre, or music-hall – we tend to identify with the actors we are watching. So that when a custard pie is thrown we fear for a moment that it has been thrown at us. And then, immediately we realise that it hasn't hit us, we experience a feeling of relief, and we laugh".&lt;ref name="reglegend2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/25/feature_will_hay_british_comedy_legend/?page=2 |title=Will Hay: Britain's bumbling star of the screen and skies. Page 2. |publisher=[[The Register]] |date=25 May 2015 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elstree Studios===
Hay had become interested in film making while touring in the United States in the 1920s, although, at the time he doubted he had a future in this field. Having returned to Britain, Hay started work at [[Elstree Studios]] in 1934 where he made three films, ''[[Those Were the Days (1934 film)|Those Were the Days]]'', ''[[Radio Parade of 1935]]'' and ''[[Dandy Dick]]''.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt;

===Gainsborough pictures===
Hay's work at Gainsborough was his most successful, and the source of his reputation as a great comic actor. During this period he became one of the most prolific film stars in Britain. On three occasions, British film exhibitors voted him among the top ten box office stars in an annual poll run by the Motion Picture Herald. He was ranked 8th in 1936, 4th in 1937 and 3rd in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article25390774 |title=PICTURES and PERSONALITIES. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=10 April 1937 |accessdate=27 April 2012 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first film for the studio was ''[[Boys Will Be Boys (1935 film)|Boys Will Be Boys]]'', whose screenplay was written by Hay himself. The movie’s satire on the public school system was loosely based on the Narkover vein of humour in the work of ''[[Daily Express]]'' columnist, [[Beachcomber (pen name)|Beachcomber]]. Hay's film was widely seen as subversive towards authority, and it was granted an A (adult) certificate by the [[British Board of Film Classification]].&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt; ''Boys Will Be Boys'' is widely regarded as Hay's break-out film. Writing for ''[[The Spectator]]'', [[Graham Greene]] described the film as "very amusing", and Hay's portrayal of Dr. Smart as "competent", though Green thought [[Claude Dampier]]'s portrayal of Second Master Finch (Hay's adversary) was the film's "finest performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Greene|first= Graham|authorlink= Graham Greene|date= 23 August 1935|title= Where's George?/The Great God Gold/Boys Will Be Boys/The Murder Man|url= |journal= [[The Spectator]]}} (reprinted in: {{cite book |editor1-last= John Russel|editor1-first= Taylor |date= 1980|title= The Pleasure Dome|url= |location= |publisher= |page= 16|isbn=0192812866}})&lt;/ref&gt; Many years later, the ''[[Radio Times]] Guide to Films'' gave ''Boys Will Be Boys'' three stars out of five, observing that the film contains "the blend of bluster and dishonesty that makes his films irresistible".&lt;ref&gt;''Radio Times Guide to Films'' (2004). p.187&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time with Gainsborough Hay worked with [[Marcel Varnel]], [[Val Guest]], [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]], and [[Marriott Edgar]], as well as [[Moore Marriott]] and [[Graham Moffatt]], who were Hay's straight men in a number of his films. Moffatt played Albert, the overweight, insolent schoolboy reminiscent of Billy Bunter, while Marriott was the toothless old Harbottle. The trio appeared in six films together between 1936 and 1940, ''[[Windbag the Sailor]]'', ''[[Oh, Mr. Porter!]]'', ''[[Convict 99]]'', ''[[Old Bones of the River]]'', ''[[Ask a Policeman]]'' and ''[[Where's That Fire?]]''.

Hay's 1937 film alongside Moffatt and Marriott, ''[[Oh, Mr. Porter!]]'' is often considered to be one of the greatest [[British comedy films]] of all-time. The [[British Film Institute]] included the film in its 360 Classic Feature Films list;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/aaronbcaldwell/dimbfi.html |title=Top 100 Movie Lists – BFI's 360 Classic Feature Films |accessdate=16 March 2007 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027094228/http://www.geocities.com/aaronbcaldwell/dimbfi.html |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine described the movie as "amusing, if over-long", noting that there was "&lt;nowiki&gt;[n]&lt;/nowiki&gt;o love interest to mar the comedy";&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cult website [[TV Cream]] listed it at number 41 in its list of cinema's Top 100 Films.&lt;ref name="tvcream"&gt;[http://www.tv.cream.org/extras/top100films/topfilms5041.htm TV Cream's Top 100 Films]&lt;/ref&gt; The director Marcel Varnel considered the film as among his best work,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''So You Want To Be In Pictures: The Autobiography of Val Guest''&lt;/ref&gt; and it was described in 2006, by ''[[The Times]]'' in its obituary for writer [[Val Guest]], as "a comic masterpiece of the British cinema".&lt;ref name="The Times, 16 May 2006"&gt;The Times, 16 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy Perry]], in his autobiography, wrote that the [[triumvirate]] of [[Captain Mainwaring]], [[Corporal Jones]] and [[Private Pike]] in ''[[Dad's Army]]'' was inspired by watching ''Oh, Mr Porter''.&lt;ref&gt;James Perry, ''A Stupid Boy'' (2002), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Moffatt and Marriott were absent from Hay's 1938 film, ''[[Hey! Hey! USA]]'' with American comedy actor [[Edgar Kennedy]] being cast as Hay's sidekick instead, the film was a somewhat unsuccessful attempt to crack the American market.&lt;ref name="reglegend3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/25/feature_will_hay_british_comedy_legend/?page=3 |title=Will Hay: Britain's bumbling star of the screen and skies. Page 3. |work=[[The Register]] |date=25 May 2015 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many of his films, Hay wore a wig, which made it appear as if he was balding.&lt;ref name="lostmaster"/&gt;

Hay decided to break up the partnership with Moffatt and Marriott after their 1940 film ''[[Where's That Fire?]]'' due to his concern that their act was becoming repetitive.&lt;ref name="lostmaster"/&gt;  Hay was known to dislike working with Moffatt and Marriott, describing his partnership with them as "a three legged stool".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpictures.com/stars/Marriott_Moore.htm |title=Moore Marriott (1885 - 1949) |publisher=British Pictures |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also expressed concern that [[Moore Marriott]] who portrayed Harbottle gained a bigger reaction from audiences than he did.&lt;ref name="lostmaster"/&gt; He had been seeking to break up their partnership in the years prior, it was only due to his film ''[[Hey! Hey! USA]]'' being somewhat unsuccessful that the writers and producers successfully talked him into bringing Moffatt and Marriott back.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt;

===Ealing Studios===
Hay left Gainsborough and began working with Ealing in 1940, this was in an attempt for him to break up his partnership with [[Graham Moffatt]] and [[Moore Marriott]] who Hay had long expressed his dissatisfaction at being associated with.&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt; [[Claude Hulbert]] and [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] acted as Hay's sidekick in his first film for Ealing, ''[[The Ghost of St Michael's]]'' (1941). Both would return to act with Hay in respective films, Hawtrey in ''[[The Goose Steps Out]]'' (1942) and Hulbert in Hay's final film, ''[[My Learned Friend]]'' (1943). [[John Mills]], who had appeared in Hay's first film, ''[[Those Were the Days (1934 film)|Those Were the Days]]'' returned to act as his sidekick in ''[[The Black Sheep of Whitehall]]''. ''[[The Goose Steps Out]]'' (1942) for Ealing was an effective piece of anti-[[Nazism|Nazi]] [[slapstick]], in the film, Hay acts as a British spy posing as a Nazi official and teaches Nazi students about British customs. When lecturing them on this topic, he tells the students that the [[V sign]] (often used in Britain as an insult) is a mark of respect, and instructs the class to make a synchronised V sign to a portrait of [[Adolf Hitler]]. This scene is often considered one of the most iconic from a [[British comedy films|British comedy film]].&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt; During Hay's tenure with Ealing he was credited as a director in three of his films, ''[[The Black Sheep of Whitehall]]'', ''[[The Goose Steps Out]]'' and ''[[My Learned Friend]]''. In all three, he co-directed with [[Basil Dearden]]. In 1942, he starred in a short information film, ''[[Go to Blazes (1942 film)|Go to Blazes]]'' alongside [[Thora Hird]] and [[Muriel George]]. The film was set during [[the Blitz]] and his role was a dim-witted father who tried unsuccessfully to defuse a bomb which had landed near his house, the bomb is only defused through the help of his daughter, portrayed by Hird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1423872/index.html |title=Go to Blazes (1942) |publisher=BFI Screen Online |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1942, he made an appearance in the [[propaganda film]], ''[[The Big Blockade]]'' among other prolific actors of the time, including [[Leslie Banks]], [[John Mills]] and [[Michael Redgrave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6f4b2339 |title=The Big Blockade (1942) |publisher=The British Film Institute |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His final film, ''[[My Learned Friend]]'' in 1943 has been described as a masterpiece of black comedy and has been cited as paving the way for the future [[Ealing comedies|Ealing comedy films]] ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' (1955).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/will-hays-new-direction-my-learned-friend |title=Will Hay's new direction: My Learned Friend |publisher=The British Film Institute |date=1 June 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to ailing health, ''My Learned Friend'' was Hay's final film.&lt;ref name="lostmaster"/&gt; The plot of the film was Hay in the role of an incompetent barrister being haunted by a serial killer and an ex-client (Mervyn Johns) who seeks to kill him.

Hay was scheduled to star in another film for Ealing in 1943, ''Bob's Your Uncle'', but his diagnosis of cancer prevented him from proceeding.&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt;

Hay's tenure with Ealing was a box office success and his films were critically acclaimed, but not as funny as those made at Gainsborough with Moffatt and Marriott.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt;

===Radio career===
The half-hour weekly Will Hay Programme began in August 1944, and was broadcast live from the [[BBC Paris Theatre]] in Lower Regent Street. The series lasted for four months and was cancelled due to Hay's dispute with the [[BBC]] over the quality of the scripts. Just before Christmas, the show went live at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre|Victoria Palace]] for six weeks. The sketch was performed one more time, on 4 May 1945 (4 days before VE Day) before the Royal Family and many military notables. This was at a private function at the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] barracks in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. It was not publicised in the newspapers due to security concerns. Hay's character during his radio series was called Dr. Muffin, a name chosen so that the students could mock him with the name "Old Crumpet".&lt;ref name="howtickled"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007m5v6 |title=How Tickled Am I? Series 2 Episode 6 — Will Hay |publisher=[[BBC Radio 7]] |date=2008 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronomy==
Aside from his [[day job]] as a comedian, Hay was a dedicated and respected amateur [[astronomer]]. He constructed a personal observatory in his garden in [[Mill Hill]] and built a [[glider (aircraft)|glider]] in 1909.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} He became a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1932 and is noted for having discovered a [[Great White Spot]] on the planet [[Saturn]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr//full/seri/MNRAS/0094//0000085.000.html |title=The spot on Saturn |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=94 |year=1933 |page=85 |last=Hay |first=W.T. |accessdate=11 May 2017|bibcode = 1933MNRAS..94...85H |doi = 10.1093/mnras/94.1.85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spot lasted for a few months and then faded away. He also measured the positions of [[comet]]s with a [[micrometer]] he built himself, and designed and built a [[blink comparator]]. He wrote the book ''Through My Telescope'' in 1935, which had a foreword by [[Sir Richard Gregory, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Gregory]], formerly Emeritus Professor of Astronomy at Queen's College, London. Hay kept his career in astronomy separate from his comedy career, he published his school ''Through My Telescope'' under the name of '''W.T. Hay''' and used the same title when giving lectures on astronomy.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt; Hay was an advocate for education on astronomy and considered those who had an interest in astronomy "the only men who see life in its true proportion". In a 1933 interview with the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' he stated "If we were all astronomers, there'd be no more war."&lt;ref name="mobberley"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2009JBAA..119...67M |title=Will Hay (1888-1949) and his telescopes |first1=Martin P. |last1=Mobberley |first2=Kenneth J. |last2=Goward |journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association |volume=119| issue = 2 |pages=67–81 |year=April 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2017|bibcode = 2009JBAA..119...67M }}&lt;!-- Also available here http://martinmobberley.co.uk/WillHay.html --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was a friend of [[William Herbert Steavenson]], who would go on to become the [[President of the Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="mobberley"/&gt; When Hay died, a few items of his equipment were bequeathed to the [[British Astronomical Association]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Hay has an asteroid named in his honour, Asteroid 3125 Hay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbDkCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT162&amp;lpg=PT162&amp;dq=asteroid+named+after+will+hay&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7GOThEjZZL&amp;sig=hG1m7opBxu6LcAEsm8WrVWwCq8A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDidmUgM3TAhULKcAKHfL5DBMQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=asteroid%20named%20after%20will%20hay&amp;f=false |title=Asteroids: A History |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |date=26 April 2016 |first=Curtis |last=Peebles |isbn=9781944466046 |accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life, health issues and death==
Hay married Gladys Perkins (1889–1982) in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Marriages: DEC 1907 8d 287 SALFORD – William Thomson Hay = Gladys Perkins&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had known since he was 15,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=22 August 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58592.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but legally separated on 18 November 1935. However, they never divorced. Gladys cited the reason for this as she was a Roman Catholic.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt; They had two daughters and a son: Gladys Elspeth Hay (1909–1979), William Edward Hay (1913–1995)&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Births: SEP 1913 8d 120 SALFORD – William E. Hay&lt;/ref&gt; and Joan A. Hay (1917–1975).&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Births: SEP 1917 8d 64 SALFORD – Joan A. Hay&lt;/ref&gt; Following his separation from Gladys in 1935, he was in a long-term relationship with Randi Kopstadt, a native of Norway.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt;

Off-screen, Hay was described as being something of an eccentric, and a very serious and private man, and some thought he may have had a dark side due to his demeanour.&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt; [[Peter Ustinov]], who made his film debut in ''[[The Goose Steps Out]]'' as a straight man to Hay, said in a 1990 interview when asked about working with him "Well, Will Hay wasn't very funny but I found that very few comics are"; he also said "And Will Hay was always wrapped in a blanket at certain hours and had his tea, and we all stopped talking while he was having his tea, and then we went on shooting. I don't remember him saying anything memorable, nothing I could remember at all. He was very funny when you saw him on the screen, but in life all those people are very, very strange."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/audio/id/1124365/ |title=Peter Ustinov: The Guardian Interview |publisher=BFI Screen Online |date=7 April 1990 |accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was  known to be a [[hypochondriac]], and would often complain of illness to his colleagues when working.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt;

In 1931, Hay was King Rat of the [[Grand Order of Water Rats]]. Hay made his final public appearance at a convention by the organisation on 15 April 1949.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt;

Hay was a passionate aviator, and gave flying lessons to [[Amy Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/humber/content/articles/2005/10/18/amy_johnson_feature.shtml "Local history: Amy Johnson]", BBC Humberside, 24 September 2014, accessed 2 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 while on holiday, Hay suffered a stroke which left the right side of his body crippled and also affected his speech, Hay was told by his doctors that he would in all likelihood only make a partial recovery.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt; Following his stroke, he spent time in [[South Africa]] on the advice of his doctors, because of the climate.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt; However, his health had improved slightly by the following year when Hay had plans to become a film producer. However, in 1947, his friend [[Marcel Varnel]], who had directed many of Hay's films, died in a car accident, and Hay postponed his plans.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt;

Hay died at his flat in [[Chelsea, London]] after a further stroke on 18 April 1949 and is buried in [[Streatham Park Cemetery]], London.&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths: JUN 1949 5c 251 CHELSEA – William T. Hay, aged 60&lt;/ref&gt; He had made his last public appearance on Good Friday 1949, just three days earlier. Those who were present at Hay's final appearance described him as showing no sign of illness, and said he had discussed his plans for the future.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt;

==Influences==
Comedians who have cited Hay as an influence include [[Ken Dodd]],&lt;ref name="tomahawk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tomahawkpress.com/will-hay/ |title=Will Hay |first=Graham |last=Rinaldi |publisher=Tomahawk Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780955767012 |accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Morecambe]], [[Tommy Cooper]], [[Harry Worth]],&lt;ref name="reglegend3"/&gt; [[Harry Enfield]], [[Jimmy Perry]] and [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]].&lt;ref name="jimmyperry"/&gt; Hay was also an influence on [[Tony Hancock]], who often portrayed characters of a format similar to that of Hay, typically impostors who tried to hide their true identity.&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt; [[Ronnie Barker]] also cited Hay as an influence, and in 1976 hosted a documentary on [[BBC Radio]] that discussed Hay's life and career.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Buggleskelly Bench.jpg|thumb|right|The Will Hay Appreciation Society's 'Buggleskelly' memorial bench to Will Hay and his co-stars, unveiled on Sunday 14th October 2018 in Cliddesden, Hampshire, the filming location for 'Oh, Mr. Porter!']]

''The Will Hay Appreciation Society'' was founded in 2009, which aims to preserve Hay's legacy and bring his work to a new generation of fans. As of October 2018, the organisation has over 3000 members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.photogra-fix.com/willhay]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Will Hay Appreciation Society'' unveiled a memorial bench to Will Hay, [[Moore Marriott]] and [[Graham Moffatt]] in October 2018, in [[Cliddesden]], [[Hampshire]] the filming location for 'Buggleskelly' in "Oh, Mr. Porter!".  The bench was unveiled by [[Pete Waterman]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.basingstokegazette.co.uk/news/16988533.mr-porter-returns-to-cliddesden-with-guests-in-tow/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The humour of Hay's films has been described as subversive and similar to that of fellow English comedian [[Frank Randle]]. His films are often characterised as exhibiting traits of [[Anti-authoritarianism]] and having a satirical approach towards how authority figures are portrayed. This is notable with Hay himself, who often played an incompetent authority figure who struggled not to be found out, but whose idiocy was discovered by those around him.&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt;

He is mentioned in the 1984 song "Jibber and Twitch" on the British band [[Cardiacs|Cardiacs']] album [[The Seaside (album)|The Seaside]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Cardiacs-jibber-and-twitch-lyrics]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 a posthumous biography of Hay was published with a foreword by [[Ken Dodd]]. Hay never published an autobiography during his lifetime; however, when ill in the 1940s, he had begun writing one, entitled ''I Enjoyed Every Minute''. Excerpts from this unpublished autobiography were included in the 2009 book.&lt;ref name="tomahawk"/&gt;

[[Roy Hudd]] defined Hay as the "supreme master" of [[sketch comedy]].&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt;

Comedian [[Harry Enfield]] created an affectionate parody of Hay as "Will Silly" in his 1989 [[mockumentary]] [[Norbert Smith: A Life]].

[[File:"Prove it with a Kodak".jpg|thumb|An early woman amateur photographer. Kodak advertisement from 1918]]

The participation of '''women in photography''' goes back to the very origins of the process. Several of the earliest women photographers, most of whom were from Britain or France, were married to male pioneers or had close relationships with their families. It was above all in northern Europe that women first entered the business of photography, opening studios in Denmark, France, Germany, and Sweden from the 1840s, while it was in Britain that women from well-to-do families developed photography as an art in the late 1850s. Not until the 1890s did the first studios run by women open in New York City.

Following Britain's [[The Linked Ring|Linked Ring]], which promoted artistic photography from the 1880s, [[Alfred Stieglitz]] encouraged several women to join the [[Photo-Secession]] movement which he founded in 1902 in support of so-called [[pictorialism]]. In Vienna, [[Dora Kallmus]] pioneered the use of photographic studios as fashionable meeting places for the Austro-Hungarian aristocracy.

In the United States, women first photographed as amateurs, several producing fine work which they were able to exhibit at key exhibitions. They not only produced portraits of celebrities and Native Americans but also took landscapes, especially from the beginning of the 20th century. The involvement of women in [[photojournalism]] also had its beginnings in the early 1900s but slowly picked up during [[World War I]].

==Early participants==

While the work of the English and French gentlemen involved in developing and pioneering the process of photography is well documented, the part played by women in the early days tends to be given less attention.&lt;ref name="Newhall1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhall|first=Beaumont|title=The history of photography: from 1839 to the present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9xTAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=1982|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|isbn=978-0-87070-381-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The beginnings===

Women were however involved in photography from the start. [[Constance Fox Talbot]], the wife of [[Henry Fox Talbot]], one of the key players in the development of photography in the 1830s and 1840s, had herself experimented with the process as early as 1839.&lt;ref name="Buckland1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckland|first=Gail|title=Fox Talbot and the invention of photography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtBTAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=1980|publisher=D. R. Godine|isbn=978-0-87923-307-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Ovenden]] attributes to her a hazy image of a short verse by the Irish poet [[Thomas Moore]], which would make her the earliest known female photographer.&lt;ref&gt;Maev Kennedy, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/dec/09/bodleian-library-bid-fox-talbot-archive "Bodleian Library launches £2.2m bid to stop Fox Talbot archive going overseas"], ''The Guardian'', 9 December 2012. Retrieved 11 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Atkins]], a botanist, was also introduced to photography by Fox Talbot, who explained his "photogenic drawing" technique to her as well as his camera-based [[calotype]] process. After learning about the [[cyanotype]] process from its inventor, [[John Herschel]], she was able to produce cyanotype [[photogram]]s of dried algae. She published them in 1843 in her ''Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions'', said to be the first book with photographic illustrations.&lt;ref name="AtkinsSchaaf1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkins|first1=Anna|last2=Schaaf|first2=Larry John|last3=Kraus|first3=Hans P.|title=Sun gardens: Victorian photograms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ld5TAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=1985|publisher=Aperture|isbn=978-0-89381-203-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another botanist and keen amateur photographer, [[John Dillwyn Llewelyn]], was possibly introduced to photography by his wife Emma Thomasina Talbot, a cousin of Fox Talbot.&lt;ref name="Marien2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marien|first=Mary Warner|title=Photography: A Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsolmLbz8igC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=2006|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=978-1-85669-493-3|pages=35–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife had shown an early interest in photography and did all his printing.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pritchard, [http://www.mpritchard.com/photohistory/history/llewelyn.htm "Llewelyn, John Dillwyn"], Michael Pritchard.

===The first professionals===

In France, [[Geneviève Élisabeth Disdéri]] was an early professional in the photography business. Together with her husband, [[André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri]] who is remembered for patenting the [[carte de visite]] process, she established a [[daguerrotype]] studio in [[Brest, France|Brest]] in the late 1840s. After Disdéri left her for Paris in 1847, she continued to run the business alone.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly E. Wilder, [http://www.answers.com/topic/genevi-ve-lisabeth-disd-ri "Geneviève Élisabeth Disdéri"], ''Oxford Companion to the Photograph''. Retrieved 12 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertha Wehnert-Beckmann]] was probably Germany's first professional female photographer. In 1843, she opened a studio in [[Leipzig]] together with her husband and ran the business herself after his death in 1847.&lt;ref name=nicole&gt;[http://www.dresden.de/media/pdf/gleichstellung/Strassennamen1.pdf Nicole Schönherr, ''Straßennamen in Dresden – Reine Männersache?''] Landeshauptstadt Dresden.

After a slow start, business picked up and she ran the studio until 1885 when she transferred it to her nephew.&lt;ref name=Bake&gt;[http://www.hamburg.de/clp/frauenbiografien-namensregister/clp1/hamburgde/onepage.php?BIOID=3209&amp;qR=E&amp;PR=1 Rita Bake, "Emilie Bieber"], Hamburg.de. {{de icon}} Retrieved 12 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[Sarah Louise Judd]] (1802–1886) is reported to have made daguerrotypes in [[Minnesota]] as early as 1848.&lt;ref name="PalmquistKailbourn2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmquist|first1=Peter E.|last2=Kailbourn|first2=Thomas R.|title=Pioneer Photographers from the Mississippi to the Continental Divide: A Biographical Dictionary, 1840–1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNipzykMBEIC&amp;pg=PA366|accessdate=22 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4057-9|pages=366–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thora Hallager]], one of Denmark's earliest women photographers, probably practiced in [[Copenhagen]] from the beginning of the 1850s. She is however remembered above all for the fine portrait of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] she took in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tidsskrift.dk/index.php/fundogforskning/article/view/1604/2658 Tove Hansen, "Kvinders fotografi Kvindelige fotografer i Danmark før 1900"], ''Fund og Forskning'', Vol 29 (1990). {{da icon}} Retrieved 12 April February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden too, women entered the photography business at an early stage. [[Brita Sofia Hesselius]] performed [[Daguerreotype]] photography in [[Karlstad]] as early as 1845,&lt;ref&gt;Värmland förr och nu 1984. Karlstad framför kameran. Bromander, Carl Wilhelm: Från dagerrotypi till kamerakonst. Ett yrkes åttioårshistoria i Karlstad.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marie Kinnberg]] was one of the very first to use the new photographic technique in Gothenburg in 1851-52.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dahlman, Eva: Kvinnliga pionjärer, osynliga i fotohistorien&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilda Sjölin]] became a professional photographer in [[Malmö]] in 1860, opening a studio there the following year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://malmomuseer.se/thumbnails.php?album=26 "Hilda Sjölin"], Malmö Museer. {{se icon}} Retrieved 12 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Sofia Ahlbom]] also included photography among the arts she practiced in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/sqvinnor/0012.html Wilhelmina Stålberg, P. G. Berg, "Sofia Ahlbom"], "Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor" (1864). {{se icon}} Retrieved 12 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, [[Bertha Valerius]] in Stockholm became official photographer of the Royal Swedish court (later followed as such by her student [[Selma Jacobsson]]). During the 1860s, they were at least 15 confirmed female photographers in Sweden, three of whom, [[Rosalie Sjöman]], [[Caroline von Knorring]] and Bertha Valerius belonging to the elite of their profession. In 1888, the first woman, Anna Hwass, became a member of the board of the Photographic Society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In Switzerland, [[Alwina Gossauer]] (1841–1926) became one of the first women professional photographers.&lt;ref name="fotostiftung"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotostiftung.ch/de/archive-spezialsammlungen/index-der-fotografinnen/fotografin/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_mssccumulus_msscphotographerlist%5Bfotograf%5D=1746&amp;tx_mssccumulus_msscphotographerlist%5BimgId%5D=&amp;tx_mssccumulus_msscphotographerlist%5Bletter%5D=G&amp;tx_mssccumulus_msscphotographerlist%5Baction%5D=show&amp;tx_mssccumulus_msscphotographerlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Photographer&amp;cHash=e239a32ff866cd45feb51d628a037ec7|title=Gossauer, Alwina|publisher=fotostiftung.ch|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foto-ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foto-ch.ch/?a=fotograph&amp;id=22628&amp;lang=it|title=Gossauer, Alwina|publisher=foto-ch.ch|author=Marc Herren|language=German|date=2015-04-08|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pioneering artists===
Two British ladies are remembered for their early contributions to artistic photography. In the late 1850s, [[Lady Clementina Hawarden]] began to take photographs. The earliest images were landscapes taken on the Hawarden estate in [[Dundrum, County Tipperary|Dundrum]], Ireland. After the family moved to London, in 1862 she converted the first floor of her [[South Kensington]] home into a studio, filling it with props which can be seen in her photographs. She specialised in portraits, especially of her two eldest daughters clad in the costumes of the day. Her work earned her silver medals at the exhibitions of the [[Royal Photographic Society|Photographic Society]] in 1863 and 1864.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/pictures/the-scottish-aristocrat-whose-pioneering-photography-drew-admiration-from-lewis-carroll-1-2778249 Mike Merritt, "The Scottish aristocrat whose pioneering photography drew admiration from Lewis Carroll"], ''The Scotsman'', 7 February 2013.

Although her interest in photography did not begin until 1863 when she was 48 years old, she consciously set out to ensure photography became an acceptable art form, taking hundreds of portraits of children and celebrities. While her commitment to soft focus was frequently criticized as technically deficient during her lifetime, it later formed the basis for the [[Pictorialism]] movement at the beginning of the 20th century and is now widely appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmp.ucr.edu/collections/permanent/object_genres/photographers/women/cameron.html "Artistic Portraiture: Julia Margaret Cameron"], Woman Photographers, UCR/California Museum of Photography.

===History of Female Photographers in America===

Prior to the roaring twenties there were little to non female photographers in existence. After the huge advancement in culture after the roaring twenties the number of photographers that were women increase drastically. Estimated to be about 5,000 female photographers. Despite there still being an apparent line of gender limitations photography allowed for females to bring forth their creativity. Along came with many different opportunities including different publications such as "American Amateur Photographer" that allowed for women photographers whether she was an amateur or not to further showcase their skills. With no longer being labeled as "a wife of a photographer" women who already have a keen eye for the fashionable side of things photographer seem to be strong suit for them.The emergence of women in photography can be attributed to the progressive era. Where the roles of women in our every day society were changed tremendously and reversed. This time period a vast number of women photographers were reportedly apart of photography organizations.

==The pictorialists==
{{See also|Pictorialism}}
The use of photography as an art form had existed almost from the very beginning but it was towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century that under the influence of the American [[Alfred Stieglitz]] its artistic potential, termed [[pictorialism]], became widely recognized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsmia.org/get-the-picture/print/stieglitz.shtml "Get the Picture: Alfred Stieglitz"], Minneapolis Institute of Arts.

Their association with Stieglitz led in 1902 to their becoming co-founders of the [[Photo-Secession]] movement. They went on to take romantic, yet well composed portraits which were presented at influential exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmp.ucr.edu/collections/permanent/object_genres/photographers/women/pictorialism.html "Gertrude Kasebier"], Women Photographers, UCR/California Museum of Photography.

[[Claude Cahun]] (1894–1954) from France is remembered for her highly staged self-portraits which she began taking in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Salter, [http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG3363979/Claude-Cahun-The-surreal-deal.html "Claude Cahun: The surreal deal"], ''The Telegraph'', 6 January 2008. Retrieved 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian-born [[Dora Maar]] (1907–1997) also developed her interest in Surrealism in France, associating with [[André Breton]] and others. Her vivid portraits from the early 1930s bring out the features of the face as if drawn by an artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorkartworld.com/reviews/maar.html Donald Goddard, "Dora Maar: Photographer"], ''New York Art World''. Retrieved 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Lee Miller]] (1907–1977) combined her fashion photography with Surrealism, associating with [[Pablo Picasso]] in Paris before returning to New York. She created some of the most striking nude photographs of the times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/l/lee-miller/ "Lee Miller"], V&amp;A. Retrieved 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrealism continued to attract the interest of women photographers in the second half of the 20th century. [[Henriette Grindat]] (1923–1986) was one of the few Swiss women to develop an interest in artistic photography, associating with André Breton and later collaborating with [[Albert Camus]], with whom she published images of the [[Sorgue|River Sorgue]] in the south of France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lejournaldelaphotographie.com/entries/4942/henriette-grindat-ou-l-anticonformisme "Henriette Grindat or the nonconformist"], ''Journal de la Photographie''. Retrieved 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 1940s, The Czech [[Emila Medková]] (1928–1985) began producing surrealistic works in 1947, above all remarkable documentary images of the urban environment in the oppressive post-war years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/emila-medkova-magic-despair Krzysztof Fijałkowski, "Emila Medková: The Magic of Despair"], Tate, 1 October 2005. Retrieved 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not strictly a Surrealist, the notable Mexican photographer [[Lola Álvarez Bravo]] (1907–1993) displayed elements of Surrealism throughout her career, especially in her portraits of [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[María Izquierdo (artist)|María Izquierdo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchestergalleries.org/angelsofanarchy/resources/artists "Artist Biographies: Lola Alvarez Bravo"], Manchester Galleries. Retrieved 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; During her short life [[Francesca Woodman]] (1958–1981), influenced by André Breton and [[Man Ray]], explored the relationship between the body and its surroundings often appearing partly hidden in her black-and-white prints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/francesca-woodman-10512 "Francesca Woodman 1958–1981"], Tate. Retrieved 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolving American participation==
Peter E. Palmquist who researched the history of women photographers in California and the American West from 1850 to 1950 found that in the 19th century some 10% of all photographers in the area were women while by 1910 the figure was up to about 20%. In the early days, most women working commercially were married to a photographer. Indeed, up to 1890, any woman working on her own was considered to be daring. As the process became easier to handle, more amateurs emerged, many participating in photographic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cla.purdue.edu/WAAW/palmquist/Essays.htm#e21 Peter E. Palmquist, "Preface"], ''Women in Photography Archive''. Retrieved 14 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, according to scholars, it was hard for women to become successful photographers.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36589970|title=Silent witnesses : representations of working-class women in the United States|last=1969-|first=Ellis, Jacqueline,|date=1998|publisher=Bowling Green State University Popular Press|isbn=9780879727444|location=Bowling Green, OH|oclc=36589970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== African-American women in photography ==

=== History ===

Photographs are pictures ''about'' and ''of'' things (Birt). As society has evolved, African-American photographers have been critical in the preservation of authentic portrayals of images ''about ''and ''of ''black culture. The participation of African-American women in photography began to receive widespread acknowledgment in the mid-20th century and with growing recognition came a shift in focus on social, economic, and political conditions. Some of the most prominent female African-American photographers include [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Lorna Simpson]], and [[Coreen Simpson]].

==== Carrie Mae Weems ====
Born in [[Portland, Oregon]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]] started her career in 1973 when she received her first camera. Her initial interest in the arts started in 1965, when she met lifelong friend Tom Vinters and began participating in street theater and dance. Though noted as an accomplished photographer, Weems' work spans text, fabric, audio, digital images, installation, and video. "…from the very beginning I've been interested in the idea of power and the consequences of power; relationships are made and articulated through power."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Carrie Mae Weems|last = Bey|first = Dawoud|date = Summer 2009|journal = BOMB|doi = |pmid = |jstor=40428266|pages=60–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; When exploring the idea of power, Weems oftentimes uses herself as the subject of her work, not for her own admiration, but "as a vehicle for approaching the question of power…"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Through different mediums, Weems has made it her mission to explore the family relationships, gender roles, the histories of racism, sexism, class and different types of political systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carriemaeweems.net/bio.html|title= Carrie Mae Weems|date= |accessdate=12 April 2015 |website = carriemaeweems|publisher = Lisa Goodlin Design|last = Weems|first = Carrie Mae}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was introduced to [[Dawoud Bey]] in 1976 and developed a long lasting friendship and professional relationship with the photographer. While on a work trip to Europe, Bey interviewed Weems in BOMB, a magazine focused on artists in conversation. 
[[File:LornaSimpsonApr09 cropped.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Lorna Simpson]]

==== Lorna Simpson ====
[[Lorna Simpson]] began her career in fashion photography, taking pictures of people whose style she admired. Simpson was able to develop her skills and became a photojournalist who captured images in politics, culture, music, and sports.

Receiving her education in photography at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in New York and the [[University of California, San Diego]], Lorna Simpson was considered a pioneer of conceptual photography well before the peak of her career. Through her work, Simpson aims to challenge the traditional views of gender, identity, culture, history, and memory as viewed by society. Her combination of large-scale photography with meaningful text work together to provide strong visual implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lsimpsonstudio.com/#mi=11&amp;pt=0&amp;pi=6&amp;p=-1&amp;a=-1&amp;at=0|title = Lorna Simpson|accessdate =15 April 2015|website = Lorna Simpson Studio|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work can be found in museums across the country at the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York|Museum of Modern Art]] (NY), the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] (Chicago, IL), and the [[Walker Art Center]] (Minneapolis), and many others around the world.

==== Coreen Simpson ====
Making her mark as a photojournalist, [[Coreen Simpson]] started her career as a published writer. Her interest in documenting experiences in writing grew into a love for the visual arts when she contacted Essence magazine about an article she wanted to write about a business trip to the Middle East. Although the article was never published, her interest in photojournalism was heightened.

In his article "Coreen Simpson: An Interpretation", Rodger Birt describes looking at a photograph as being "let in on the workings of another human consciousness" allowing for the simultaneous opportunity to receive an authentic depiction of the physical world.&lt;ref name="Birt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birt|first1=Rodger|title=Coreen Simpson: An Interpretation|journal=Black American Literature Forum|date=1987|volume=21|issue=3|pages=289–304|jstor=2904032|doi=10.2307/2904032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her work, Simpson has created visual narratives that aesthetically tell the stories of diverse groups of people. Not only is she able to evoke emotional responses through her storytelling, but through design, [[chiaroscuro]], and color as well.

Simpson's friend, Walter Johnson, became one of her biggest mentors and guide as she expanded her knowledge in photography. She also studied Frank Stewart's process and developed a strong capacity for the history of photography. One of her biggest struggles was to differentiate her visual style from those of her inspiration.

The four greatest influences of Simpson's work include [[Diane Arbus]], [[Adolph de Meyer|Baron Adolph DeMeyer]], [[Joel Peter Witkin]], and [[Weegee]]. Whether conceptually, methodically, or creatively, each of these photographers have contributed to her approach in different ways.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2904032|title = Coreen Simpson: An Interpretation|last = Birt|first = Rodger|date = Autumn 1997|journal = Black American Literature Forum|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of her admiration for Arbus's uniqueness, Weegee's hunt, DeMeyer's study of the compostition, and Witkin's manipulation of the print work together in encompassing the personality of Coreen Simpson's work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Elizabeth "Tex" Williams'''

[[Elizabeth Williams (photographer)|Elizabeth "Tex" Williams]] was a world war 2 military photographer. She was in the last year of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29733207|title=Viewfinders : black women photographers|last=1951-|first=Moutoussamy-Ashe, Jeanne,|date=1993|publisher=Writers &amp; Readers Pub|isbn=0863161588|location=New York|oclc=29733207}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the first women to have a photography career beyond "camera girl".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Contemporary==
Contemporary women photographers continue to break ground in the field of photography. [[Annie Leibovitz]] captures arresting, usually posed, images of the famous and the unknown, publishing photographs for the covers of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''Vogue'', and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', representing a broad survey of American popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/people/leibovitz-annie.html "Annie Leibovitz"], Infoplease. Retrieved 14 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cindy Sherman]]'s work turns still photography into performance art to explore traditional and pop-cultural myths of femininity. Her work implicitly examines issues of identity and stereotype, representation and reality, the function of mass media, and the nature of portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/people/sherman-cindy.html "Cindy Sherman"], Infoplease.
