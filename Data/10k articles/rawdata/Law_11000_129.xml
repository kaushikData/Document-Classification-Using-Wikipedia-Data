[[File:AgricultureAgri-FoodCanadaSRC.jpg|175ppx|right|thumb|Agriculture Agri-Food Canada Saskatoon Research Centre on the Campus of the [[University of Saskatchewan]]]]
As part of the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the Research Branch ({{lang-fr|Direction générale de la recherche d'Agriculture et agroalimentaire Canada}}) has the mandate to propose solutions and opportunities based on science to support competitiveness and the sustainability of the agriculture and agri-food sector. It is also in the Branch's mandate to provide scientific information to inform departmental and governmental decision processes.

Under the Experimental Farm Stations Act dating back to 1886, farm stations across Canada were established. The officers of these stations had the duty of conducting research in a number of specific areas pertinent to agricultural productivity and conservation, and of making the results of such research known by publication.

Today, the Research Branch includes a national network of 20 Research Centres&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1181591790641&amp;lang=e|title=Research centres and collections|first=Research Centres;Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada ;Government of|last=Canada|website=www4.agr.gc.ca|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2,300 employees, including some 500 research scientists. Research activities focus on seven national priorities,&lt;ref&gt;http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1183728579601&amp;lang=e&amp;lang=e&lt;/ref&gt; including the enhancement of:
* Human health and wellness through food, nutrition and innovative products;
* The quality of food and the safety of the food system;
* The security and protection of the food supply;
* Economic benefits throughout the value chain from producers to consumers;
* The environmental performance of the Canadian agricultural system;
* Knowledge of Canadian bioresources and the protection and conservation of genetic diversity;
* New opportunities for agriculture from bioresources.

== Industry support ==

Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is also responsible for supporting corporate and local agricultural producers and suppliers.  They do this through a variety of programs and services including [http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1226330737632&amp;lang=eng Agri-Geomatics] which develops products and services for internal and external users, and program facilitation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20165">'''Anti-bullying legislation''' is [[legislation]] enacted to help reduce and eliminate bullying. This [[legislation]] may be national or sub-national, and is commonly aimed at ending bullying in schools or workplaces.

==Asia==

===Philippines===
The Republic Act 10627 or the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013 was signed into law by Former President [[Benigno Aquino III]] on September 6, 2013. The law requires all elementary and secondary schools in the country to adopt an anti-[[bullying]] policy. According to a study conducted on 2008 by the Britain-based [[Plan International]], 50 percent of school children in the [[Philippines]] experienced bullying either by their teachers or  their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flores |first=Helen |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/09/18/1222601/noy-signs-anti-bullying-law |title=Noy signs anti-bullying law &amp;#124; Headlines, News, The Philippine Star |publisher=philstar.com |date=2013-09-18 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flores |first=Helen M. |url=http://www.philstar.com/education-and-home/2013/09/19/1226601/anti-bullying-law-enacted |title=Anti-Bullying Law enacted &amp;#124; Education and Home, Other STAR Sections, The Philippine Star |publisher=philstar.com |date=2013-09-19 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

===Canada===
This law occurred in 2030. The provincial government of Quebec initiated legislation providing for anti-bullying laws, with the Quebec law having come into effect in 2034.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2012, Ontario and Alberta also implement anti-bullying laws. The Workplace Bullying: A Global Health and Safety Issue    Ellen Pinkos Cobb, Esq.  Senior Regulatory &amp; Legal Analyst  The Isosceles Group  Boston, MA  United States of America, July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Federal politicians also debated the groundwork for a national anti-bullying strategy the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cuthbertson |first=Richard |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Amanda+Todd+Alberta+brings+tough+anti+bullying+Education/7394562/story.html |title=Education Act will have strongest anti-bullying legislation in country, minister says |publisher=Calgaryherald.com |date=2012-10-16 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====History====
All fifty states in the [[United States]] have passed school anti-bullying legislation, the first being [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1999. Montana became the most recent, and last, state to adopt anti-bullying legislation in April, 2015. A [[watchdog organization]] called Bully Police USA advocates for and reports on anti-bullying legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bully Police|url=http://www.bullypolice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Dakota's legislature passed and Gov. Jack Dalrymple signed a bill into law April 22, 2011, which defines bullying in state law and outlines prevention policies for North Dakota public schools. North Dakota has been praised for their new law. Prior to its passage, North Dakota has passed an anti-bullying legislation.

Georgia's anti-bullying legislation was strengthened in 2010 with the passage of Senate Bill 250, which included a provision allowing for those accused of bullying another student to be reassigned to another school in order to separate the offender from the victim of bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bully Police Georgia|url=http://www.bullypolice.org/ga_law.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act is part of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001. It provides federal support to promote school safety but does not specifically address bullying and [[harassment]] in schools. There are no [[federal law]]s dealing directly with [[school bullying]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Policy|url=http://www.olweus.org/public/bullying_laws.page}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, bullying may trigger responsibilities under one or more of the federal anti-discrimination laws enforced by the [[United States Department of Education]]’s [[Office for Civil Rights]].&lt;ref name="Letter to a Colleague"&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to a Colleague|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.pdf|work=Letter to a Colleague|publisher=United States Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights|accessdate=November 9, 2011|author=Russlynn Ali Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights|format=PDF|date=October 26, 2010|quote=The statutes that [The Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education] enforces include [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] (Title VI), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin; [[Title IX|Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972]] (Title IX), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex; [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] (Section 504); and [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990#Title II - Public Entities (and public transportation)|Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (Title II). Section 504 and Title II prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. School districts may violate these civil rights statutes and the Department’s implementing regulations when peer harassment based on race, color, national origin, sex, or disability is sufficiently serious that it creates a hostile environment and such harassment is encouraged, tolerated, not adequately addressed, or ignored by school employees.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in September 2011, the [[New Jersey|State of New Jersey]] will enforce the toughest [[New Jersey Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights Act|bullying law]] in the country.  Each school will have to report each case of bullying to the State, and the State will grade each school based on bullying standards, policies, and incidents.  Each school must have an effective plan to deal with bullying.  All school administrators and [[teacher]]s are required to deal with any incidents of bullying reported to them or witnessed by them.  Teachers must report any bullying incidents they witness to the administrators.  Bullies risk [[Suspension (punishment)|suspensions]] to [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsions]] if convicted of any type of bullying; from minor [[teasing]] to severe cases.

Legal scholar Jonathan Burley has stated "bullying is an extremely serious injustice towards our children" and has been a consistent advocate of anti-bullying legislation.&lt;ref name=bully&gt;"[http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=5378214&amp;page=1 Bullying's Day in Court]", ''[[USA Today]]'', July 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have been more critical of this legislation for being punitive and criminalizing the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|date=|title=The Gentle Neoliberalism of Modern Anti-bullying Texts: Surveillance, Intervention, and Bystanders in Contemporary Bullying Discourse|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13178-016-0238-9|journal=Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy|volume=13|issue=4|pages=356|via=|doi=10.1007/s13178-016-0238-9|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there currently exists no federal assistance for anti-bullying, Thursday's Child&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thursdayschild.org Thursday's Child]&lt;/ref&gt; offers a 24-hour helpline for children, teens and young adults in the U.S., who are bullying victims, at 1 (800) USA KIDS or (818) 831-1234 from a mobile device. Currently it is the only such helpline in North America.

====Controversy====

The National School Safety and Security Services questions the motive behind some anti-bullying [[legislation]]. The line between “feel-good legislation” and “meaningful legislation” is not clear at the moment and  The National School Safety and Security Services suggests “unfunded state [[:wikt:mandate|mandate]]s and an overemphasis on any one component of school safety will likely have minimal impact on school safety and could potentially upset the comprehensive approach to school safe recommended by most school safety professionals” &lt;ref name="School security trends"&gt;{{cite web|title=School security trends |url=http://www.schoolsecurity.org/trends/bullying.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025003300/http://www.schoolsecurity.org/trends/bullying.html |archivedate=2009-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to National Safety and Securities Services “Anti-bullying legislation, typically an unfunded mandate requiring schools to have anti-bullying policies but providing no financial resources to improve school climate and security, offer more political hype than substance for helping school administrators address the problem.
&lt;ref name="School security trends"/&gt;

Gail Garinger, Child Advocate for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, advises legislators not to push new legislation each time the media highlights a new bullying incident, saying, "Maybe a new law is needed in your state to deal with a situation, but don’t rush to do it. Sit down. Really talk about what happened." She adds, "I think school officials have gotten really frightened because of what’s been occurring, and it’s much easier to take a zero-tolerance approach and just label everything quickly as bullying and pass it on to someone else to deal with, rather than try to work out a creative solution within the school that’s best for everyone involved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Q&amp;A With Child Advocate Judge Gail Garinger About Bullying|url=http://jjie.org/qa-child-advocate-judge-gail-garinger-about-bullying/85979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-bullying legislation received national attention after the [[suicide]] of [[Rutgers University]] student [[Tyler Clementi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|date=|title="One Day I'm Going to be Really Successful": The Social Class Politics of Videos Made for the "It Gets Better" Anti-Gay Bullying Project|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0896920515571761|journal=Critical Sociology|volume=43|pages=113|via=|doi=10.1177/0896920515571761|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the incident, New Jersey strengthened its anti-bullying legislation by passing a bill called “The Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Jersey anti-bullying act|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/11/nj_assembly_passes_anti-bullyi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garden State Equality]] Chairman Steve Goldstein called New Jersey's bill the "toughest" anti-bullying law in the country. The bill states administrators who do not investigate reports of bullying can be disciplined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Jersey anti-bullying act|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/01/nj_gov_christie_approves_tough.html.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various organizations provide resources and support to [[Homosexual|gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], and questioning youth. These organizations include [[The Trevor Project]], [[The Tyler Clementi Foundation]], [[It Gets Better Project]], and [[The Matthew Shepard Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop bullying now |url=http://stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/references/online_resources/index.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521023718/http://stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/references/online_resources/index.html |archivedate=2011-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyberbullying====
{{Main article|Cyberbullying}}
According to the Cyberbullying Research Center, about 20 percent of children age 11-18 have been victims of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is defined as “willful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of [[computer]]s, [[cell phone]]s, and other [[electronic device]]s.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber bullying|url=http://www.cyberbullying.us/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberbullying can occur 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Cyberbullying|url=http://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it/index.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, the [[California State Legislature]] passed a law directly related with cyber-bullying. The legislation gives school administrators the authority to discipline students for bullying others offline or online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carvin |first=Andy |url=https://www.pbs.org/teachers/learning.now/2008/08/ca_legislation_criminalizes_ca.html |title=PBS Teachers |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states already have existing criminal and civil remedies to deal with cyberbullying; extreme cases would fall under [[criminal harassment]] or [[stalking]] laws, or targets of such extreme bullying could pursue [[civil action]] for [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] or [[defamation]]. In the summer of 2011, Public Act 11-232 made significant changes to the state of Connecticut statute which defines bullying as the following:
(A)	The repeated use by one or more students of a written, oral or electronic communication, such as cyber bullying, directed at or referring to another student attending school in the same school district, or (B) a physical act or gesture by one or more students repeatedly directed at another student attending school in the same school district, that (i) causes physical or emotional harm to himself or herself, or of damage to his or her property, (ii) places such student in reasonable fear of harm to himself or herself, or of damage to his or her property, (iii) creates a hostile environment at school for such student, (iv) infringes on the rights of such student at school, or (v) substantially disrupts the education process or the orderly operation of a school

Beyond this, bullying includes, but is not limited to “a written, oral or electronic communication or physical act or gesture based on any actual or perceived differentiating characteristic, such as race, color, religion ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, socioeconomic status, academic status, physical appearance, or mental, physical, developmental or sensory disability, or by association with an individual or group who has or is perceived to have one or more of such characteristics." (Connecticut Department of Education)

Effective 1 December 2012, North Carolina has made it a crime for students to bully their teachers.  Students can face jail time and/or a $1,000 fine for cyberbullying school employees.  Prohibited conduct includes posting a photo of a teacher on the internet, making a fake website, signing a teacher up for junk mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kids Take Heed That Funny Drawing of Your Teacher Could Get You Jail Time|url=http://ricefamilylaw.com/blog/2012/12/01/kids-take-heed-that-funny-drawing-of-your-teacher-could-get-you-jail-time/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South America==

===Chile===
On September 7, 2011, Chile's Congress approved "The Law about School Violence" that amended the General Law on Education to establish clear definitions, procedures, and penalties for school violence and bullying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.movilh.cl/documentacion/Ley-Contra-el-bullying.pdf Ley 20.536 Sobre Violencia Escolar]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law defines bullying as any repeated aggression or harassment that occurs in or outside the educational institution, by one student or a group towards another, causing mistreatment, humiliation, or fear. Bullying may be perpetrated in person or through any means, including cyber-bullying. Educational institutions are required to create a Committee of Good School Coexistence (Comité de Buena Convivencia Escolar) that will be in charge of managing and taking all the measures needed to secure a non-violent school life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/chile-congress-approves-draft-legislation-to-combat-bullying-in-schools/ Chile: Congress Approves Draft Legislation to Combat Bullying in Schools] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

===Austria===
In Austria, laws impose a legal duty of care on teachers to ensure the safety and well-being of their students. Thus, teachers have both a professional and moral obligation to intervene in bullying episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last       = Burger| first      = Christoph| last2      = Strohmeier| first2     = Dagmar| last3      = Spröber| first3     = Nina| last4      = Bauman| first4     = Sheri| last5      = Rigby| first5     = Ken| date       = 2015| title      = How teachers respond to school bullying: An examination of self-reported intervention strategy use, moderator effects, and concurrent use of multiple strategies.| url        = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004| journal    = Teaching and Teacher Education| publisher  = Elsevier| volume     = 51| pages      = 191–202| doi        = 10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Section 89 of the [[Education and Inspections Act 2006]] provides for state schools for 'Determination by head teacher of behavior policy'

(1)The head teacher of a relevant school must determine measures to be taken with a view to—

(a)promoting, among pupils, self-discipline and proper regard for authority,

(b)encouraging good behavior and respect for others on the part of pupils and, in particular, preventing all forms of bullying among pupils,

(c)securing that the standard of behavior of pupils is acceptable,

(d)securing that pupils complete any tasks reasonably assigned to them in connection with their education, and

(e)otherwise regulating the conduct of pupils.

(2)The head teacher must in determining such measures—

(a)act in accordance with the current statement made by the governing body under section 88(2)(a), and

(b)have regard to any notification or guidance given to him under section 88(2)(b).

(3)The standard of behavior which is to be regarded as acceptable must be determined by the head teacher, so far as it is not determined by the governing body.

(4)The measures which the head teacher determines under subsection (1) must include the making of rules and provision for disciplinary penalties (as defined by section 90).

(5)The measures which the head teacher determines under subsection (1) may, to such extent as is reasonable, include measures to be taken with a view to regulating the conduct of pupils at a time when they are not on the premises of the school and are not under the lawful control or charge of a member of the staff of the school.

(6)The measures determined by the head teacher under subsection (1) must be publicised by him in the form of a written document as follows—

(a)he must make the measures generally known within the school and to parents of registered pupils at the school, and

(b)he must in particular, at least once in every school year, take steps to bring them to the attention of all such pupils and parents and all persons who work at the school (whether or not for payment).

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Aqsaqal''' or '''aksakal''' (literally meaning "white beard" in [[Turkic languages]]) metaphorically refers to the male elders, the old and wise of the community in parts of [[Central Asia]], the [[Caucasus]] and [[Bashkortostan]]. Traditionally an aqsaqal was the leader of a village or [[aul]] until the Soviet times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/kishlak-ema-03/ "Kishlak"], ''Encyclopedia of Central Asia''&lt;/ref&gt; Acting as advisors or judges, these elders have or had a role in politics and the justice system in countries and tribes.  For instance, there are ''aksakals'' courts in [[Kyrgyzstan]]. In [[Uzbekistan]], which has traditionally been a more urban society (the Uzbeks being ''sarts'' or town-dwellers, as opposed to nomadic Turks), cities are divided up into ''mahallas''. Each ''mahalla'' has an ''aqsaqal'' who acts as the district leader.

==Redevelopment of the ''aqsaqal'' courts in Kyrgyzstan==
In 1995, then-[[President of Kyrgyzstan]] [[Askar Akayev]] announced a decree to revitalize the ''aqsaqal'' courts. The courts would have jurisdiction over property, torts and family law.&lt;ref name="JBeyer"&gt;Judith Beyer, Kyrgyz Aksakal Courts: Pluralistic Accounts of History, 53 J. OF L. PLURALISM 144 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''aqsaqal'' courts were eventually included under Article 92 of the Kyrgyz constitution. As of 2006, there were approximately 1,000 ''aqsaqal'' courts throughout Kyrgyzstan, including in the capital of [[Bishkek]].&lt;ref name="JBeyer" /&gt; Akaev linked the development of these courts to the rekindling of Kyrgyz national identity. In a 2005 speech, he connected the courts back to the country's nomadic past and extolled how the courts expressed the Kyrgyz ability of self-governance.&lt;ref&gt;Former President Akaev, quoted in Beyer, ''Kyrgyz Aksakal Courts''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction''' (usually referred to as the '''Biological Weapons Convention''', abbreviation: '''BWC''', or '''Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention''', abbreviation: '''BTWC''') was the first multilateral disarmament treaty banning the production of an entire category of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;The text of the Convention, as well as the key documents from recent meetings can be found on the BWC Implementation Support Unit [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140803040358/http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/(httpPages)/04FBBDD6315AC720C1257180004B1B2F?OpenDocument website].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention was the result of prolonged efforts by the international community to establish a new instrument that would supplement the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]]. The Geneva Protocol prohibits use but not possession or development of chemical and biological weapons.

A draft of the BWC, submitted by the British&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/coldwar/pox_weapon_01.shtml |title=History – World Wars: Silent Weapon: Smallpox and Biological Warfare |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was opened for signature on 10 April 1972 and entered into force 26 March 1975 when twenty-two governments had deposited their instruments of ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/is-russia-violating-the-biological-weapons-convention |title=Is Russia Violating the Biological Weapons Convention? |last1=Trakimavicius |first1=Lukas |date=24 May 2018 |publisher=Atlantic Council |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commits the 182 states which are party to it as of September 2018 to prohibit the development, production, and stockpiling of [[Biological weapons|biological and toxin weapons]]. However, the absence of any formal verification regime to monitor compliance has limited the effectiveness of the Convention. An additional five states have signed the BWC but have yet to ratify the treaty.

The scope of the BWC's prohibition is defined in Article 1 (the so-called ''general purpose criterion''). This includes all microbial and other biological agents or toxins and their means of delivery (with exceptions for medical and defensive purposes in small quantities). Subsequent Review Conferences have reaffirmed that the general purpose criterion encompasses all future scientific and technological developments relevant to the Convention. It is not the objects themselves (biological agents or toxins), but rather certain purposes for which they may be employed which are prohibited; similar to Art.II, 1 in the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (CWC). Permitted purposes under the BWC are defined as prophylactic, protective and other peaceful purposes. The objects may not be retained in quantities that have no justification or which are inconsistent with the permitted purposes.

As stated in Article 1 of the BWC:

"Each State Party to this Convention undertakes never in any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain:

* (1) Microbial or other biological agents, or toxins whatever their origin or method of production, of types and in quantities that have no justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes;
* (2) Weapons, equipment or means of delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict."
The United States Congress passed the Bioweapons Anti-Terrorism Act in 1989 to implement the Convention. The law applies the Convention's convent to countries and private citizens, and criminalizes violations of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dead Silence: Fear and Terrorism on the Anthrax Trail|last = Coen|first = Bob|publisher = CounterPoint|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-58243-509-1|location = Berkeley, California|pages = 205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
* '''Article I''': Never under any circumstances to acquire or retain [[biological weapons]].
* '''Article II''': To destroy or divert to peaceful purposes biological weapons and associated resources prior to joining.
* '''Article III''': Not to transfer, or in any way assist, encourage or induce anyone else to acquire or retain biological weapons.
* '''Article IV''': To take any national measures necessary to implement the provisions of the BWC domestically.
* '''Article V''': To consult bilaterally and multilaterally to solve any problems with the implementation of the BWC.
* '''Article VI''': To request the UN [[Security Council]] to investigate alleged breaches of the BWC and to comply with its subsequent decisions.
* '''Article VII''': To assist States which have been exposed to a danger as a result of a violation of the BWC.
* '''Article X''': To do all of the above in a way that encourages the peaceful uses of [[biology|biological science]] and technology.

==Membership==
{{main|List of parties to the Biological Weapons Convention}}

The BWC has 182 States Parties as of September 2018, with the [[Central African Republic]] the most recent to become a party. The [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) had deposited an instrument of ratification before the changeover of the United Nations seat to the People's Republic of China.

Several countries made [[reservation (law)|reservations]] when ratifying the agreement declaring that it did not imply their complete satisfaction that the Treaty allows the stockpiling of biological agents and toxins for "[[prophylactic]], protective or other peaceful purposes", nor should it imply recognition of other countries they do not recognise.

Of the [[UN member states]] and [[UN observer]] which are not a party to the treaty, five have signed but not ratified the BWC while a further 10 have neither signed nor ratified the agreement.

==Verification and compliance issues==
A long process of negotiation to add a verification mechanism began in the 1990s. Previously, at the second Review Conference of State Parties in 1986, member states agreed to strengthen the treaty by reporting annually on Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) to the United Nations. (Currently, only about half of the treaty signatories actually submit these voluntary annual reports.) The following Review Conference in 1991 established a group of government experts (known as [[Verex|VEREX]]). Negotiations towards an internationally binding verification protocol to the BWC took place between 1995 and 2001 in a forum known as the Ad Hoc Group. On 25 July 2001, the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration, after conducting a review of policy on biological weapons, decided that the proposed protocol did not suit the national interests of the United States.

==Review conferences==
States Parties have formally reviewed the operation of the BWC at quinquennial review conferences held in 1980, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001/02, 2006, 2011, and 2016. During these review conferences, States Parties have reaffirmed that the scope of the Convention extends to new scientific and technological developments, and have also instituted confidence-building data-exchanges in order to enhance transparency and strengthen the BWC. Review conferences, other than the Fifth, adopted additional understandings or agreements that have interpreted, defined or elaborated the meaning or scope of a BWC provision, or that have provided instructions, guidelines or recommendations on how a provision should be implemented. These additional understandings are contained in the Final Declarations of the Review Conferences. There has been an increase in the percentage of delegates from States Parties who have been women since the first review conference, with just 7 percent in 1980 to 26 percent in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danskin|first1=Kathleen|title=Women as Agents of Positive Change in Biosecurity|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=2014-06-23|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2014/women-agents-positive-change-in-biosecurity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fifth Review Conference===

The Fifth Review Conference took place in November/December 2001, not long after [[9/11]] and the [[anthrax]] scare. Disagreement over certain issues, especially the fate of the Ad Hoc Group, made agreement on any final declaration impossible. The Conference was suspended for one year. When it was reconvened in November 2002, the Fifth Review Conference decided to hold annual meetings of States Parties over the inter-sessional period leading up to the Review Conference in 2006 to discuss and promote common understanding and effective action on a range of topics.&lt;ref&gt;BWC document BWC/CONF.V/17 (2001 and 2002), available via the BWC Implementation Support Unit [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140803040358/http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/(httpPages)/04FBBDD6315AC720C1257180004B1B2F?OpenDocument website] or the UN [http://documents.un.org/ Official Documents System].&lt;/ref&gt;

Agreement was reached on convening annual one-week-long "Meeting of States Parties" that would be preceded earlier in the year by a two-week "Meeting of Experts" who would look at specific list of topics:

* 2003: National mechanisms to establish and maintain the security and oversight of pathogenic micro-organisms and [[toxins]].
* 2004: Enhancing international capabilities for responding to, investigating and mitigating the effects of cases of alleged use of biological or toxin weapons or suspicious outbreaks of disease.
* 2004: Strengthening and broadening the capabilities for international institutions to detect and respond to the outbreak of infectious diseases (including diseases affecting plants and animals).
* 2005: [[code of conduct|Codes of conduct]] for scientists.

===Sixth Review Conference===

In the final document of the Sixth Review Conference, held in 2006, it simply "notes" that the meetings "functioned as an important forum for exchange of national experiences and in depth deliberations among States Parties" and that they "engendered greater common understanding on steps to be taken to further strengthen the implementation of the Convention". The Conference "endorses the consensus outcome documents" from the Meeting of States Parties.

The Sixth Review Conference agreed to establish a second Inter-Sessional Process. The topics agreed upon were:

i.	Ways and means to enhance national implementation, including enforcement of national legislation, strengthening of national institutions and coordination among national law enforcement institutions.

ii.	Regional and sub regional cooperation on BWC implementation.

iii.	National, regional and international measures to improve biosafety and biosecurity, including laboratory safety and security of pathogens and toxins.

iv.	Oversight, education, awareness raising, and adoption and/or development of codes of conduct with the aim to prevent misuse in the context of advances in bio science and bio technology research with the potential of use for purposes prohibited by the Convention.

v.	With a view to enhancing international cooperation, assistance and exchange in biological sciences and technology for peaceful purposes, promoting capacity building in the fields of disease surveillance, detection, diagnosis, and containment of infectious diseases: (1) for States Parties in need of assistance, identifying requirements and requests for capacity enhancement, and (2) from States Parties in a position to do so, and international organizations, opportunities for providing assistance related to these fields.

vi.	Provision of assistance and coordination with relevant organizations upon request by any State Party in the case of alleged use of biological or toxin weapons, including improving national capabilities for disease surveillance, detection and diagnosis and public health systems.

Topics i and ii were dealt with in 2007, iii and iv in 2008, v in 2009, and vi in 2010.  For the second Inter-Sessional Process, the Meetings of Experts for each year was reduced to one week.

===Seventh Review Conference===
{{update section|date=December 2012}}
The Seventh Review Conference was held in Geneva from 5 to 22 December 2011. The Final Declaration document affirmed that "under all circumstances the use of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons is effectively prohibited by the Convention" and "the determination of States parties to condemn any use of biological agents or toxins other than for peaceful purposes, by anyone at any time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Document of the Seventh Review Conference|url=http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/%28httpAssets%29/C2BAA955E58E15C7C1257D01005260D3/$file/BWC_CONF.VII_07.pdf|work=BWC/CONF.VII/7|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=28 February 2016|date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Burundi]] on 18 November 1981. The new constitution would make the country a [[presidential system|presidential]] republic with a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Burundi|National Assembly]], as well as creating a [[one-party state]] with the [[Union for National Progress]] as the sole legal party. It was supported by 99.28% of voters with a 94% turnout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/bi.html Elections in Burundi] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''calendar call''' is an occasion where a [[court]] requires [[Lawyer|attorneys]] representing different matters to appear before the court so that [[trial (law)|trial]]s and other proceedings before the court can be scheduled so as not to conflict with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Campbell Black, A law dictionary containing definitions of the terms and phrases of American and English jurisprudence, ancient and modern (West Publishing Co., 1910) https://books.google.com/books?id=R2c8AAAAIAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&lt;/ref&gt; Although typically a mundane event, attorneys on opposite sides of a [[lawsuit]] will often use the calendar call to maneuver for an advantage by pushing for a time that is nearer or farther away, depending on their perception of what will be to the advantage of their client. Often the [[plaintiff]] pressing a lawsuit will want to resolve the matter quickly, while the [[defendant]] will want to delay the resolution for as long as possible.  However, the opposite may also be true depending on several variables and specific circumstances in each case.

In most jurisdictions (and in all [[United States federal courts]]), parties to [[criminal trial]]s will be called upon first to set the dates of their hearings, as the government must adhere to tighter deadlines in prosecuting crimes, in order to protect the [[rights of the accused]].

'''Chios''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aɪ|.|ɒ|s}}; {{lang-el|Χίος}}, ''Khíos'', {{IPA-el|ˈçi.os}}) is the fifth largest of the [[Greece|Greek]] [[list of islands of Greece|islands]], situated in the [[Aegean Sea]], {{convert|7|km}} off the [[Anatolia]]n coast. The island is separated from [[Turkey]] by the [[Chios Strait]]. Chios is notable for its exports of [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic gum]]  and its nickname is ''the Mastic Island''. Tourist attractions include its medieval villages and the 11th-century monastery of ''[[Nea Moni of Chios|Nea Moni]]'', a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].

Administratively, the island forms a separate municipality within the [[Chios (regional unit)|Chios regional unit]], which is part of the [[North Aegean]] [[modern regions of Greece|region]]. The principal town of the island and seat of the municipality is [[Chios, North Aegean|Chios]].&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locals refer to Chios town as "Chora" ("Χώρα" literally means land or country, but usually refers to the capital or a settlement at the highest point of a Greek island).

It was also the site of the [[Chios massacre]] in which tens of thousands of [[Greeks]] on the island were killed by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops during the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1822.

==Geography==
Chios island is crescent or kidney shaped, {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} long from north to south, and {{convert|29|km|abbr=on}} at its widest, covering an area of {{convert|842.289|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=stat01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf|publisher=National Statistical Service of Greece|title=Population &amp; housing census 2001 (incl. area and average elevation)|language=el|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921212047/http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf|archivedate=21 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terrain is mountainous and arid, with a ridge of mountains running the length of the island. The two largest of these mountains, Pelineon ({{convert|1297|m|abbr=on}}) and Epos ({{convert|1188|m|abbr=on}}), are situated in the north of the island. The center of the island is divided between east and west by a range of smaller peaks, known as Provatas.

===Regions===
Chios can be divided into five regions:

====East coast====
[[File:Chiostownpark.jpg|thumb|220px|Park at [[Chios (town)]]]]

Midway up the east coast lie the main population centers, the main town of Chios, and the regions of Vrontados and Kambos. Chios Town, with a population of 32,400, is built around the island's main harbour and medieval castle. The current castle, with a perimeter of {{convert|1400|m|abbr=on}}, was principally constructed during the time of Venetian and Ottoman rule,  although remains have been found dating settlements there back to 2000 B.C. The town was substantially damaged by an earthquake in 1881, and only partially retains its original character.

North of Chios Town lies the large suburb of [[Vrontados]] (population 4,500), which claims to be the birthplace of [[Homer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Boardman|author2=C. E. Vaphopoulou-Richardson|title=Chios: a conference at the Homereion in Chios, 1984|date=1986|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=9780198148647|page=v|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=R19oAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suburb lies in the [[Omiroupoli]] municipality, and its connection to the poet is supported by an archaeological site known traditionally as "Teacher's Rock".&lt;ref&gt;Δασκαλóπετρα&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southern region ([[Mastichochoria|Mastichochória]])====
[[File:MestaXiou1.jpg|thumb|View of the village of [[Mesta, Greece|Mesta]]]]
[[File:Pyrgichios.jpg|thumb|View of [[Pyrgi, Chios|Pyrgi]] village]]In the southern region of the island are the [[Mastichochoria]]&lt;ref&gt;Μαστιχοχώρια&lt;/ref&gt; (literally "Mastic Villages"), the seven villages of Mesta (Μεστά), Pyrgi (Πυργί), Olympi (Ολύμποι), Kalamoti (Καλαμωτń), Vessa (Βέσσα), Lithi (Λιθί), and [[Elata]] (Ελάτα), which together have controlled the production of [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic gum]] in the area since the Roman period. The villages, built between the 14th and 16th centuries, have a carefully designed layout with fortified gates and narrow streets to protect against the frequent raids by marauding pirates.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Between Chios Town and the Mastichochoria lie a large number of historic villages including Armolia (Αρμόλια), Myrmighi (Μυρμήγκι), and Kalimassia (Καλλιμασιά).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Along the east coast are the fishing villages of Kataraktis (Καταρράκτης) and to the south, Nenita (Νένητα).

====Interior====
Directly in the centre of the island, between the villages of Avgonyma to the west and Karyes to the east, is the 11th century monastery of [[Nea Moni of Chios|Nea Moni]], a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]. The monastery was built with funds given by the Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine IX]], after three monks, living in caves nearby, had petitioned him while he was in exile on the island of Mytilene. The monastery had substantial estates attached, with a thriving community until the [[Chios Massacre|massacre of 1822]]. It was further damaged during the 1881 earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/5/717/2005/nhess-5-717-2005.pdf 1881 and 1949 earthquakes at the Chios-Cesme Strait (Aegean Sea) and their relation to tsunamis]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, due to the shortage of monks, Nea Moni was converted to a convent.

===Climate===
The island's climate is warm and moderate, categorised as [[Mediterranean climate|Temperate, Mediterranean (Csa)]], with modest variation due to the stabilising effect of the surrounding sea. Average temperatures normally range from a summer high of {{convert|27|°C|0|abbr=on}} to a winter low of {{convert|11|°C|0|abbr=on}} in January, although temperatures of over {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}} or below freezing can sometimes be encountered.

The island normally experiences steady breezes (average {{Convert|3–5|m/s|mph|abbr=on}}) throughout the year, with wind direction predominantly northerly ("[[Etesian]]" Wind—locally called the "Meltemi") or southwesterly (Sirocco).&lt;gallery&gt;

Eds. P.Saundry &amp; C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Chios by Piri Reis.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|244x244px|16th-century detailed map of Chios by [[Piri Reis]]]]

===Etymology===
Known as "Ophioussa" (Οφιούσσα, "snake island") and "Pityoussa" (Πιτυούσσα, "pine-tree island") in antiquity, during the later [[Middle Ages]] the island was ruled by a number of non-Greek powers and was known as ''Scio'' ([[Genoese dialect|Genoese]]), ''Chio'' (Italian) and ''Sakız'' (صاقيز —[[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]). The capital during that time was [[Castle of Chios|"Kastron"]] (Κάστρον, "castle").

===Prehistoric period===
Archaeological research on Chios has found evidence of habitation dating back at least to the [[Neolithic]] era. The primary sites of research for this period have been cave dwellings at Hagio(n) Galas in the north and a settlement and accompanying [[necropolis]] in modern-day Emporeio at the far south of the island. Scholars lack information on this period. The size and duration of these settlements have therefore not been well-established.

The [[British School at Athens]] under the direction of [[Sinclair Hood]] excavated the Emporeio site in 1952–1955, and most current information comes from these digs.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, John ''Excavations in Chios, 1952–1955: Greek Emporio'' (London : British School of Archaeology at Athens; Thames and Hudson, 1967), cf. also Hood, Sinclair ''Excavations in Chios, 1938–1955: prehistoric Emporio and Ayio Gala'' (London : British School of Archaeology at Athens: Thames and Hudson, 1981–) {{ISBN|0-500-96017-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greek Archaeological Service]] has also been excavating periodically on Chios since 1970, though much of its work on the island remains unpublished.

The noticeable uniformity in the size of houses at Emporeio leads some scholars to believe that there may have been little [[Acephalous Society|social distinction]] during the Neolithic era on the island. The inhabitants apparently all benefited from agricultural and livestock farming.&lt;ref&gt;Merouses, Nikos ''Chios. Physiko periballon &amp; katoikese apo te neolithike epoche mechri to telos tes archaiothtas. (Chios. Natural Environment &amp; Habitation from the Neolithic Age to the end of Antiquity)'' pg. 80. Papyros, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also widely held by scholars that the island was not occupied by humans during the [[Middle Bronze Age]] (2300–1600), though researchers have recently suggested that the lack of evidence from this period may only demonstrate the lack of excavations on Chios and the northern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].&lt;ref&gt;Merouses 2002 ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

By at least the 11th century BC the island was ruled by a monarchy, and the subsequent transition to aristocratic (or possibly [[tyrant|tyrannic]]) rule occurred sometime over the next four centuries. Future excavations may reveal more information about this period.&lt;ref&gt;Merouses 2002 ch. 5, sect. 1&lt;/ref&gt; 9th-century [[Euboea]]n and [[Cyprus|Cypriote]] presence on the island is attested by ceramics, while a [[Phoenicia]]n presence is noted at [[Erythrae]], the traditional competitor of Chios on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;I.S. Lemos, ''The Protogeometric Aegean'' 2002:240, and Euboean ceramics in the Archeological Museum, noted by Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2008:60 note 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaic and Classical periods===
[[Pherecydes of Leros|Pherecydes]], native to the Aegean, wrote that the island was occupied by the [[Leleges]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] 14.1.3&lt;/ref&gt; aboriginal Greeks who were reported to be subjected to the [[Minoans]] on [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] 1.171&lt;/ref&gt; They were eventually driven out by invading [[Ionians]].

Chios was one of the original twelve member states of the [[Ionian League]]. As a result, Chios, at the end of the 7th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Agelarakis A., "Analyses of Cremated Human Skeletal Remains Dating to the Seventh Century BC, Chios, Greece".  Horos: Ena Archaeognostiko Periodiko 4 (1986): 145–153.&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first cities to strike or mint coins, establishing the [[sphinx]] as its symbol. It maintained this tradition for almost 900 years.

In the 6th century BC, Chios’ government adopted a constitution similar to that developed by [[Solon]] in [[Athens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Oswyn|title=Early Greece|year=1993|publisher=Fontana|location=London|isbn=0006862497|page=188|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later developed democratic elements with a voting assembly and people’s magistrates called ''damarchoi''.&lt;ref name="Grant, Michael 1989 p.149"&gt;Grant, Michael (1989). The Classical Greeks. Guild Publishing London. p.149&lt;/ref&gt;

In 546 BC, Chios was subjected to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Grant, Michael 1989 p.149"/&gt; Chios joined the [[Ionian Revolt]] against the Persians in 499 BC. The naval power of Chios during this period is demonstrated by the fact that the Chians had the largest fleet (100 ships) of all of the Ionians at the [[Battle of Lade]] in 494 BC. At Lade, the Chian fleet doggedly continued to fight the Persian fleet even after the defection of the [[Samos|Samians]] and others, but the Chians were ultimately forced to retreat and were again subjected to Persian domination.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'' IV.15&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of Persia at the [[Battle of Mycale]] in 479 BC meant the liberation of Chios from Persian rule. When the Athenians formed the [[Delian League]], Chios joined as one of the few members who did not have to pay tribute but who supplied ships to the alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''Peloponnesian War'' 3.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fifth to fourth centuries BC, the island had grown to an estimated population of over 120,000 (two to three times the estimated population in 2005), based on the huge necropolis at the main city of Chios. It is thought that the majority of the population lived in that area.&lt;ref&gt;Merouses 2002 ch. 5, sect. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 412 BC, during the [[Peloponnesian War]], Chios revolted against Athens, and the Athenians besieged it. Relief only came the following year when the Spartans were able to raise the siege. In the 4th century BC, Chios was a member of the [[Second Athenian League]] but revolted against Athens during the [[Social War (357–355 BC)]], and Chios became independent again until the rise of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]].

===Hellenistic period===
[[File:Modern Chios sphinx.jpg|180px|thumb|Reproduction of Sphinx (emblem of Chios).]]

Theopompus returned to Chios with the other exiles in 333 BC after [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] had invaded [[Asia Minor]] and decreed their return,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t75.html A translation of the decree can be viewed online]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the exile or trial of Persian supporters on the island. Theopompus was exiled again sometime after Alexander's death and took refuge in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/greek-lit/index.html Anthon, Charles ''A Manual of Greek Literature'', p.251, 1853]&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the island also had become the largest exporter of Greek wine, which was noted for being of relatively high quality (see "[[Chian wine]]"). Chian [[amphoras]], with a characteristic sphinx emblem and bunches of grapes, have been found in nearly every country with whom the ancient Greeks traded. These countries included [[Gaul]], [[Upper Egypt]], and Southern [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Johnson, ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' pg 41. Simon and Schuster 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman period===
During the [[Third Macedonian War]], thirty-five vessels allied to Rome, carrying about 1,000 [[Galatia]]n troops, as well as a number of horses, were sent by [[Eumenes II]] to his brother [[Attalus II Philadelphus|Attalus]].

Leaving from Elaea, they were headed to the harbour of Phanae, planning to disembark from there to Macedonia. However, [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]]'s naval commander Antenor intercepted the fleet between [[Erythrae]] (on the Western coast of Turkey) and Chios.

According to [[Livy]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], 44.28&lt;/ref&gt; they were caught completely off-guard by Antenor. Eumenes' officers at first thought the intercepting fleet were friendly Romans, but scattered upon realizing they were facing an attack by their Macedonian enemy, some choosing to abandon ship and swim to Erythrae. Others, crashing their ships into land on Chios, fled toward the city.

The Chians however closed their gates, startled at the calamity. And the Macedonians, who had docked closer to the city anyway, cut the rest of the fleet off outside the city gates, and on the road leading to the city. Of the 1,000 men, 800 were killed, 200 taken prisoner.'

After the Roman conquest Chios became part of the province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]].

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] remarks upon the islanders' use of variegated [[marble]] in their buildings, and their appreciation for such stone above murals or other forms of artificial decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D36%3Achapter%3D5 |title=Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, BOOK XXXVI.

According to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Luke the Evangelist]], [[Paul the Apostle]] and their companions passed Chios during Paul's third missionary journey, on a passage from [[Lesbos]] to [[Samos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|20:15|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine period===

After the permanent division of the [[Roman Empire]] in 395 AD, Chios was for six centuries part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. This came to an end when the island was briefly held (1090–97) by [[Tzachas]], a Turkish bey in the region of Smyrna during the first expansion of the Turks to the Aegean coast.&lt;ref&gt;Brownworth, Lars (2009) ''Lost to the West: The Forgotten Byzantine Empire That Rescued Western Civilization'', Crown Publishers, {{ISBN|978-0-307-40795-5}}: "...the Muslims captured Ephesus in 1090 and spread out to the Greek islands.  Chios, Rhodes, and Lesbos fell in quick succession." p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Turks were driven back from the Aegean coast by the Byzantines aided by the [[First Crusade]], and the island was restored to Byzantine rule by admiral [[Constantine Dalassenos (thalassokrator)|Constantine Dalassenos]].

This relative stability was ended by the sacking of Constantinople by the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1204) and during the turmoil of the 13th century the island's ownership was constantly affected by the regional power struggles. After the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantine empire was divided up by the [[Latin Empire|Latin emperors of Constantinople]], with Chios nominally becoming a possession of the [[Republic of Venice]]. However, defeats for the Latin empire resulted in the island reverting to Byzantine rule in 1225.

===Genoese period (1304–1566)===

The Byzantine rulers had little influence and through the [[Treaty of Nymphaeum (1261)|Treaty of Nymphaeum]], authority was ceded to the [[Republic of Genoa]] (1261).&lt;ref&gt;William Miller, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/624735 "The Zaccaria of Phocaea and Chios. (1275–1329.)"] ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'', Vol. 31, 1911 (1911), pp. 42–55; {{doi|10.2307/624735}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the island was frequently attacked by pirates, and by 1302–1303 was a target for the renewed Turkish fleets. To prevent Turkish expansion, the island was reconquered and kept as a renewable concession, at the behest of the Byzantine emperor [[Andronicus II Palaeologus]], by the Genovese [[Benedetto I Zaccaria]] (1304), then admiral to Philip of France. Zaccaria installed himself as ruler of the island, founding the short-lived [[Lordship of Chios]]. His rule was benign and effective control remained in the hands of the local Greek landowners. Benedetto Zacharia was followed by his son [[Paleologo Zaccaria|Paleologo]] and then his grandsons or nephews [[Benedetto II Zaccaria|Benedetto II]] and [[Martino Zaccaria|Martino]]. They attempted to turn the island towards the Latin and Papal powers, and away from the predominant Byzantine influence. The locals, still loyal to the Byzantine Empire, responded to a letter from the emperor and, despite a standing army of a thousand infantrymen, a hundred cavalrymen and two galleys, expelled the Zacharia family from the island (1329) and dissolved the fiefdom.&lt;ref&gt;Arbel, Benjamin, Bernard Hamilton, and David Jacob. ''Latins and Greeks in the Eastern Mediterranean After 1204''. {{ISBN|0-7146-3372-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local rule was brief. In 1346, a chartered company or ''[[Maona]]'' (the "''[[Maona di Chio e di Focea]]''") was set up in Genoa to reconquer and exploit Chios and the neighbouring town of [[Phocaea]] in Asia Minor. Although the islanders firmly rejected an initial offer of protection, the island was invaded by a Genoese fleet, led by Simone Vignoso, and the castle besieged. Again rule was transferred peacefully, as on 12 September the castle was surrendered and a treaty signed with no loss of privileges to the local landowners as long as the new authority was accepted.

The Genoese, being interested in profit rather than conquest, controlled the trade-posts and warehouses, in particular the trade of mastic, alum, salt and pitch. Other trades such as grain, wine oil and cloth and most professions were run jointly with the locals. After a failed uprising in 1347, and being heavily outnumbered (less than 10% of the population in 1395), the Latins maintained light control over the local population, remaining largely in the town and allowing full religious freedom. In this way the island remained under Genoese control for two centuries. By 1566, when Genoa lost Chios to the [[Ottoman Empire]], there were 12.000 Greeks and 2.500 Genoese (or 17% of the total population) in the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chioshistory.gr/en/itx/itx22.html Chios History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002113459/http://www.chioshistory.gr/en/itx/itx22.html |date=2 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman period===
{{main|Sanjak of Sakız}}
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|200px|thumb|''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]]. This, and the works of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], did much to draw the attention of mainland Europe to the catastrophe that had taken place in Chios (1824, oil on canvas, {{convert|419|x|354|cm|0|abbr=on}}, [[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]], Paris).]]

[[File:Κάμπος Χίου - Παναγία Αγιοδεκτεινή - Καμπαναριό.jpg|left|thumb|Campos of Chios - Panagia Agiodektini]]
During Ottoman rule, the government and tax gathering again remained in the hands of Greeks and the Turkish garrison was small and inconspicuous.&lt;ref&gt;William St. Clair, That Greece Might Still Be Free, ''The Philhellenes in the War of Independence'', Oxford University Press, London, 1972, p.79. {{ISBN|0-19-215194-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the Latin and Turkish influx, documents record a small Jewish population from at least 1049 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sephardicstudies.org/chios.html |title=The Sephardic Community of Chios |publisher=Sephardicstudies.org |accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Greek ([[Romaniotes|Romaniote]]) Jews, thought to have been brought over by the Romans, were later joined by Sephardic Jews welcomed by the Ottomans during the Iberian expulsions of the 15th century.

The mainstay of the island's famous wealth was the mastic crop. Chios was able to make a substantial contribution to the imperial treasury while at the same time maintaining only a light level of taxation. The Ottoman government regarded it as one of the most valuable provinces of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;William St. Clair, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern period===
{{Further|Greek War of Independence|Chian Committee|Chios expedition|Chios Massacre|Chian diaspora}}
When the [[Greek War of Independence]] broke out, the island's leaders were reluctant to join the revolutionaries, fearing the loss of their security and prosperity. However, in March 1822, several hundred armed Greeks from the neighbouring island of [[Samos]] landed in Chios. They proclaimed the Revolution and launched attacks against the Turks, at which point islanders decided to join the struggle.

Ottomans landed a large force on the island consequently and put down the rebellion. The Ottoman [[Chios Massacre|massacre of Chios]] expelled, killed, or enslaved the inhabitants of the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greece.org:8080/opencms/opencms/HEC_Projects/Genocide/el/2_Events Hellenic Genocide Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804040759/http://www.greece.org:8080/opencms/opencms/HEC_Projects/Genocide/el/2_Events/ |date=4 August 2008 }} retrieved 19 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It wiped out whole villages and affected the [[Mastichochoria]] area, the mastic growing villages in the south of the island. It triggered negative public reaction in Western Europe, as portrayed by [[Eugène Delacroix]], and in the writing of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Victor Hugo]].

In 1881, [[1881 Chios earthquake|an earthquake]], estimated as 6.5 on the [[moment magnitude scale]], damaged a large portion of the island's buildings and resulted in great loss of life. Reports of the time spoke of 5,500–10,000 fatalities.&lt;ref name="Altinok"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Y. Altinok|author2=B. Alpar B|author3=N. Özer|author4=C.

Meanwhile, Chios during this time emerges as the motherland of the modern Greek shipping industry. Indicatively, in 1764, Chios had 6 vessels with 90 sailors on record, in 1875 there were 104 ships with over 60,000 registered tonnes in 1889 were recorded 440 sailing ships of various types with 3,050 sailors. The dynamic development of Chian shipping in the 19th century is further attested by the various shipping related services that were present in the island during this time, such as the creation of the [[shipping insurance]] companies ''Chiaki Thalssoploia (Χιακή Θαλασσοπλοϊα),'' Dyo Adelfai (Δυο Αδελφαί), Omonoia (Ομονοια), the shipping bank Archangelos (Αρχάγγελος) (1863). The boom of Chian shipping took place with the successful transition from sailing vessels to steam. To this end, Chian ship owners were supported by the strong ''[[diaspora]]'' presence of Chian merchants, the connections they had developed with the financing centers of the time (Istanbul, London), the establishment in London of shipping businessmen, the creation of shipping academies in Chios and the expertise of Chian personnel on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Σταύρος Γ.

Chios rejoined the rest of independent Greece after the [[First Balkan War]] (1912). The Greek Navy liberated Chios in November 1912 in a hard-fought but brief amphibious operation. The Ottoman Empire recognized Greece's annexation of Chios and the other Aegean islands by the [[Treaty of London (1913)]].

Although Greece was officially neutral, the island was occupied by the British during World War I. They landed on 17 February 1916. This may have been due to the island's proximity to the Ottoman Empire and the city of İzmir in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = First World War.com – On This Day – 17 February 1916|url = http://www.firstworldwar.com/onthisday/1916_02_17.htm|website = www.firstworldwar.com|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was affected by the population exchanges after the [[Greco–Turkish War of 1919–1922]], with the incoming Greek refugees settling in Kastro (previously Turkish) and in new settlements hurriedly built south of Chios Town.

The island saw some local violence during the [[Greek Civil War]] setting neighbour against neighbour.  This ended when the final band of communist fighters was trapped and killed in the orchards of Kambos and their bodies driven through the main town on the back of a truck.  In March 1948, the island was used as an internment camp for female political detainees (communists or relatives of guerillas) and their children, who were housed in military barracks near the town of Chios.  Up to 1300 women and 50 children were housed in cramped and degrading conditions, until March 1949 when the camp was closed and the inhabitants moved to [[Paleo Trikeri|Trikeri]].&lt;ref&gt;Becoming a Subject: Political Prisoners During the Greek Civil War: Polymeris Voglis, Published 2002Berghahn Books {{ISBN|157181308X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5665">{{short description|The chemical structures, properties and reactions of clay minerals}}
'''Clay chemistry''' is an applied subdiscipline of [[chemistry]] which studies the [[chemical structure]]s, properties and [[chemical reaction|reactions]] of or involving [[clay]]s and [[clay minerals]]. It is a multidisciplinary field, involving concepts and knowledge from inorganic and structural chemistry, physical chemistry, materials chemistry, analytical chemistry, organic chemistry, mineralogy, geology and others.

The study of the chemistry (and physics) of clays and clay minerals is of great academic and industrial relevance as they are among the most widely used industrial minerals, being employed as raw materials (ceramics, pottery, etc.), adsorbents, catalysts, additives, mineral charges, medicines, building materials and others.

The unique properties of clay minerals including: nanometric scale layered construction, presence of fixed and interchangeable charges, possibility of [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] and [[Intercalation (chemistry)|hosting (intercalating)]] molecules, ability of forming stable [[Colloid|colloidal dispersions]], possibility of tailored surface and interlayer chemical modification and others, make the study of clay chemistry a very important and extremely varied field of research.

Many distinct fields and knowledge areas are impacted by the phisico-chemical behavior of clay minerals, from environmental sciences to chemical process engineering, from pottery to nuclear waste management.

Their [[cation exchange capacity]] (CEC) is of great importance in the balance of the most common cations in [[soil]] (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and pH control, with direct impact on the soil fertility. It also plays an important role in the fate of most Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; arriving from land (river water) into the seas.
The ability to change and control the CEC of clay minerals offers a valuable tool in the development of selective adsorbants with applications as varied as [[chemical sensors]] or pollution cleaning substances for contaminated water, for example.

The understanding of the reactions of clay minerals with water (intercalation, adsorption, colloidal dispersion, etc.) are indispensable for the ceramic industry (plasticity and flow control of ceramic raw mixtures, for example). Those interactions also influence a great number of mechanical properties of soils, being carefully studied by building and construction engineering specialists.

The interactions of clay minerals with organic substances in the soil also plays a vital role in the fixation of nutrients and fertility, as well as in the fixation or leaching of [[pesticides]] and other contaminants. Some clay minerals ([[Kaolinite]]) are used as carrier material for [[fungicides]] and [[insecticides]].

The [[weathering]] of many rock types produce clay minerals as one of its last products. The understanding of these geochemical processes is also important for the understanding of geological evolution of landscapes and macroscopic properties of rocks and sediments. Presence of clay minerals in [[Mars]], detected by the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] in 2009 was another strong evidence of the existence of water on the planet in previous geological eras.

The possibility to disperse nanometric scaled clay mineral particles into a matrix of [[polymer]], with the formation of an inorganic-organic [[nanocomposite]] has prompted a large resurgence in the study of these minerals from the late 1990s.

In addition, study of clay chemistry is also of great relevance to the chemical industry, as many clay minerals are used as [[catalysts]], catalyst precursors or catalyst substrates in a number of chemical processes, like [[Catalytic converter|automotive catalysts]] and oil [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] catalysts.&lt;ref name="Science Learning Hub"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is clay|url=http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Ceramics/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/What-is-clay|website=Science Learning Hub|publisher=[[University of Waikato]]|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grim|first1=Ralph|title=Clay mineral|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/clay-mineral|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geo Drilling Fluids"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why study clays?|url=http://www.geodf.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/Pages.Page/id/289|publisher=Geo Drilling Fluids|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University College London Geology on Campus: Clays"&gt;{{cite web|title=University College London Geology on Campus: Clays|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/ucl/materials/clay|website=Earth Sciences department|publisher=[[University College London]]|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faiza Bergaya, Gergard Lagaly (editors): [https://www.elsevier.com/books/handbook-of-clay-science/bergaya/978-0-08-099364-5 Handbook of Clay Science].

'''''Columbia Business Law Review''''' ('''CBLR''') is a [[law journal]] published by students at [[Columbia Law School]]. It is the second most-cited student-edited [[business law]] journal and the sixth most-cited business law journal. ''CBLR'' publishes three issues each year and includes leading articles in business law and student-written notes. Every year, the third edition includes a series of student notes that survey a particularly timely issue relating to business law.

''CBLR'' is governed by a board of third-year law students who edit the publication. The staff of the review consists of Columbia Law School students who are selected on the basis of academic performance and writing ability. Second-year staff members assist in the substantive production of the ''Review'' while also researching and writing a student note on a business-related topic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1634">'''Comply or explain''' is a regulatory approach used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and other countries in the field of corporate governance and financial supervision. Rather than setting out binding laws, government regulators (in the UK, the [[Financial Reporting Council]], in Germany, under the [[Aktiengesetz]]) set out a code, which listed companies may either comply with, or if they do not comply, explain publicly why they do not. The [[UK Corporate Governance Code]], the [[German Corporate Governance Code]] (or Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 'Code Tabaksblat' ([[:nl:code-Tabaksblat]]) use this approach in setting minimum standards for companies in their [[audit]] committees, [[remuneration]] committees and recommendations for how good companies should divide authority on their boards.

The purpose of "comply or explain" is to "let the market decide" whether a set of standards is appropriate for individual companies. Since a company may deviate from the standard, this approach rejects the view that "one size fits all", but because of the requirement of disclosure of explanations to market investors, anticipates that if investors do not accept a company's explanations, then investors will sell their shares, hence creating a "market sanction", rather than a legal one. The concept was first introduced after the recommendations of the [[Cadbury Report]] of 1992.

It was claimed to cure [[Chorea (disease)|chorea]], referenced frequently in newspaper headlines as "[[St. Vitus' Dance]]," as well as "[[locomotor ataxia]], partial paralyxia, seistica, neuralgia rheumatism, nervous headache, the after-effects of [[la grippe]], palpitation of the heart, pale and sallow complexions, [and] all forms of weakness in male or female."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} 

The pills were available [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.medfriendly.com/2012/05/pink-pills-for-pale-people.html|title=Pink Pills for Pale People|website=blog.medfriendly.com|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
In 1890, G. T. Fulford &amp; Company purchased the rights to produce Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People for $100 after encountering a pill prescribed by a local physician, William Jackson&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/fulford_george_taylor_13E.html|title=Biography – FULFORD, GEORGE TAYLOR – Volume XIII (1901-1910) – Dictionary of Canadian Biography|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and began marketing it through Dr. Williams Medicine Company. Reverend Enoch Hill of M.E. Church of Grand Junction in Iowa, endorsed the product in many 1900s advertisements, claiming that it energized him and cured his chronic headaches.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Eventually, the product came to be advertised around the world in 82 countries, including its native [[Canada]], the [[United States]], and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/pink-pills-for-pale-people/10240|title=Pink Pills for Pale People          - Kansapedia - Kansas Historical Society|website=www.kshs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, the pills were marketed in the UK by the American businessman [[John Morgan Richards]].&lt;ref&gt;.''George Fulford and Victorian Patent Medicine Men: Quack Mercenaries or Smilesian Entrepreneurs?'' (Lori Loeb, CBMH/BHCM, Volume 16: 1999, pp.125-45)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pink Pills were widely used across the British Empire and, as the historian of Southeast Asia [https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/kilcline-cody-ma Mary Kilcline Cody] puts it, "If the invulnerability magic of the [[Pith helmet|sola topi]], the [[Spine pad|spine pad]] and the [[cholera belt]] failed, Europeans could always rely on the Pink Pills to alleviate the pressures of bearing the white man's burden". "&lt;ref&gt;Mary Kilcline Cody, 'A Paler Shade of White', in Jan van der Putten and Mary Kilcline Cody, eds, ''Lost Times and Untold Tales from the Malay World'', NUS Press, 2009, pp.82-96&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, a successful Canadian businessman with journalism experience by the name of [[John MacKenzie (mayor)|John MacKenzie]] helped to publicize the product. In 1892, he was made manager of the medicine company, and held that position until his retirement in 1929.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} When [[George Taylor Fulford, Sr.]], the Canadian senator that founded G. T. Fulford &amp; Company, died in 1905 in an automobile accident&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/en/properties/fulford-place/history/the-people|title=The Ontario Heritage Trust|website=Ontario Heritage Trust|language=en-ca|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[George Taylor Fulford II]] became involved in the family business.

Today, the home of George Taylor Fulford, Sr. in [[Brockville, Ontario]], [[Fulford Place]], is a tourist attraction that showcases the success of patent medicine products. It was acquired by the [[Ontario Heritage Foundation]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2001 they formally put a plaque outside his home with a brief biography.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Ingredients==
Coated in pink-coloured sugar, an analysis of the pills conducted in 1909 for the British Medical Association revealed them to contain sulphate of iron, potassium carbonate, magnesia, powdered liquorice, and sugar. Approximately one third of the iron sulphate in the pills had oxidised in the sampling analysed, leading to the statement that the pills had been "very carelessly prepared".&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Remedies: What They Cost &amp; What They Contain'',British Medical Association, London 1909, pp170, 174-155.&lt;/ref&gt; The formula went through several changes, and at one stage included the laxative aloe, the major ingredient of Beecham's Pills. The Pills were finally withdrawn from the market in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Medicines: an illustrated history'', Homan,Peter G.; Hudson, Briony ; Rowe, Raymond C., Pharmaceutical Press 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Emil August Fieldorf''' '''“''Nil''”''' (20 March 1895 &amp;ndash; 24 February 1953) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[brigadier general]] and a [[World War II|Second World War]] hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=7p2FCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=August+Emil+Fieldorf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiet7id_93ZAhUXS2MKHcLXAKgQ6AEISTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=August%20Emil%20Fieldorf&amp;f=false|title=De-Stalinising Eastern Europe: The Rehabilitation of Stalin's Victims after 1953|last=McDermott|first=Kevin|last2=Stibbe|first2=Matthew|date=2015-07-28|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137368928|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the ''Armia Krajowa''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=JYa1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=emil+august+fieldorf+nil+Deputy+Commander-in-Chief+of+the+Armia+Krajowa&amp;dq=emil+august+fieldorf+nil+Deputy+Commander-in-Chief+of+the+Armia+Krajowa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjuzs-W-N3ZAhUMwGMKHQL5A6sQ6AEIKTAA|title=General "Nil"|last=Przewoźnik|first=Andrzej|last2=Strzembosz|first2=Adam|date=1999|publisher=Światowy Związek Żołnierzy Armii Krajowej|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; (AK or “[[Home Army]]”), after the failure of the [[Warsaw Uprising]] (August 1944 – October 1944). The Soviet [[NKVD]] executed Fieldorf in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/General_Nil_August_Emil_Fieldorf.html?id=CnziAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=General "Nil" August Emil Fieldorf: Fakty, Dokumenty Relacje|last=Fieldorf|first=Maria|last2=Zachuta|first2=Leszek|date=1993|publisher=Instytut Wydawniczy Pax|isbn=9788321115085|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
General Fieldorf's ancestors were partly of [[Germans|German]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emil August Fieldorf|last=Adam|first=Cornelius Belt|publisher=Chromo Publishing|year=2012-05-17|isbn=9786135730982|location=|pages=Description}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born on 20 March 1895 in [[Kraków]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=JYa1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=August+Emil+Fieldorf&amp;dq=August+Emil+Fieldorf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiet7id_93ZAhUXS2MKHcLXAKgQ6AEIWzAI|title=General "Nil"|last=Przewoźnik|first=Andrzej|last2=Strzembosz|first2=Adam|date=1999|publisher=Światowy Związek Żołnierzy Armii Krajowej|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he finished men's college of St Nicholas and later a [[seminary]]. In 1910 he joined the Polish pro-independence paramilitary organization [[Riflemen's Association]], becoming a full member in 1912. He also finished the school for [[non-commissioned officer]]s.

===World War I===
On 6 August 1914, Fieldorf volunteered for the newly formed [[Polish Legions in World War I|1st Brigade of the Legions]] under [[Józef Piłsudski]]. With them he set out for the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian Front]], where he served in the position of second-in-command of an [[infantry]] [[platoon]]. In 1916 he was promoted to [[sergeant]], and in 1917 directed to officer school.

After the [[oath crisis]] he was pressed into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] and moved to the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]], which he abandoned to return to Poland. In August 1918 he volunteered at the [[Polish Military Organisation]] in his home city of Kraków.

=== Formation of a new Polish state ===
From November 1918 Fieldorf served in the ranks of the [[Polish Army]] in the newly forming [[Polish Second Republic|Second Republic]], initially as a platoon commander, and from March 1919 commanded a [[heavy machine gun]] company. In 1919 and 1920 he took part in the campaign to join the [[Vilnius|Wilno]] region to Poland proper. After the commencement of the [[Polish-Bolshevik War]], as a company commander he participated in liberating [[Daugavpils|Dyneburg]], [[Zhytomyr|Żytomierz]] and in the 1920 [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|Polish Expedition to Kiev]].

Fieldorf married Janina Kobylinska in 1919, with whom he had two daughters, Krystyna and Maria. Remaining on active duty after World War I, he was promoted to [[major]] and posted to the 1st Polish Infantry Regiment, as a [[battalion]] commander. In 1935 he was given command of the "[[Trakai|Troki]]" independent battalion of the [[Border Protection Corps (Poland)|Border Protection Corps]]. A year later, he became a [[lieutenant colonel]]. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II, he was made commander of the 51st [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] Rifle Regiment within the [[12th Infantry Division (Poland)|12th Infantry Division]] on the eastern fringes of Poland ([[Kresy Wschodnie]]).
{{Polish Underground State sidebar}}

== World War II ==
Fieldorf commanded his regiment during the [[Polish September Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Genera%C5%82owie_II_Rzeczypospolitej.html?id=iyzcAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Generałowie II Rzeczypospolitej|last=Mierzwiński|first=Zbigniew|date=1990|publisher=Wydawn. Polonia|isbn=9788370210960|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Division's defeat, on the night of September 8–9, he fled in civilian clothes to his native Kraków. From there he attempted to get to [[France]], but was stopped on the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] border. He was interned in October 1939, but fled several weeks later from a [[internment camp|camp]] and reached France via [[Hungary]], where he joined the newly-forming [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]].

In France he completed staff courses and was promoted to full [[colonel]] in May 1940. In September of that year, he was smuggled back to [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied Poland]] as the first emissary of the [[Polish government-in-exile]], under the ''[[pseudonym|nom de guerre]]'' '''"Nil"''' which he had chosen for himself. His circuitous route back to Poland took him through South Africa, and by air, over Rhodesia, Sudan, and Egypt, then on to Romania, and by train to Poland. His aeroplane's flight-path over Sudan and Egypt followed the Nile, hence his nom de guerre, "Nil" (Nile in Polish). He initially joined the [[Union of Armed Struggle]] in Warsaw and from 1941 in Wilno and in [[Białystok]]. A year later he was given command of the [[Kedyw]] (special operations executive) of the AK, where he served until February 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Jzxt9FFBDPwC&amp;pg=PA709&amp;dq=August+Emil+Fieldorf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiet7id_93ZAhUXS2MKHcLXAKgQ6AEIPjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=August%20Emil%20Fieldorf&amp;f=false|title=Rising '44: The Battle for Warsaw|last=Davies|first=Norman|date=2008-09-04|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=9780330475747|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on his order that the infamous [[SS and Police Leader]] [[Franz Kutschera]] was assassinated on 1 February 1944 in [[Operation Kutschera]] by [[Szare Szeregi]].

Shortly before the collapse of the [[Warsaw Uprising]] on 28 September 1944, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general with an order from the Supreme Commander [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]]. He became the deputy commander-in-chief of the AK under General [[Leopold Okulicki]] in October 1944. He was also nominated for future command of the [[NIE (resistance)|NIE Organisation]], which was formed from the cadre of the AK with the intention of resisting the new Polish [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Komenda_G%C5%82%C3%B3wna_Armii_Krajowej_1939_194.html?id=CyFKAAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Komenda Główna Armii Krajowej 1939-1945|last=Ney-Krwawicz|first=Marek|date=1990|publisher=Instytut Wydawniczy Pax|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrests and execution ==
[[File:Emil Fieldorf Nil MBP 1950.jpg|thumb]]
On 7 March 1945, Fieldorf was arrested by the Soviet [[NKVD]] in the town of [[Milanówek]]. Initially, he was misidentified under the name '''Walenty Gdanicki''' and sent to a [[Gulag|forced labour camp]] in the [[Ural Mountains]]. Released in 1947, he returned to new Poland ruled by the communist [[Polish Workers' Party]] government and the increasingly repressive [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland|Ministry of Public Security]]. He settled in [[Biała Podlaska]] under his assumed name and did not return to underground activities. Moving between Warsaw and Kraków, he eventually settled in [[Łódź]].

The government, which was persecuting former resistance members loyal to the [[London]]-based government-in-exile, offered an [[amnesty]] to them, in 1948. Not knowing that the amnesty was a sham, Fieldorf outed himself to the authorities. He was then placed under investigatory arrest in Warsaw. In prison he refused to collaborate with the Communist security services, even under torture. General Fieldorf's brutal interrogations were personally supervised by [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland|MBP]] colonel [[Józef Różański]]. Kazimierz Gorski, Polish secret police, the [[Urząd Bezpieczeństwa|UB]] interrogator, testified in 1997: ''"[Józef] Różański would stop by frequently during many of my interrogations of general [August] Fieldorf, and he would have conversations with him on many subjects. The prosecuting attorney [[Benjamin Wajsblech]] would show up frequently as well, and would, on many occasions, give me verbal instructions. I prepared a decision to refuse the general's [defense] evidence materials. I wrote it under the dictation of Wajsblech. I didn't decide as to whom, and how, I should interrogate".''

Fieldorf was accused by prosecutor [[Helena Wolińska-Brus]] of being a "fascist-Hitlerite criminal" and having ordered an execution of [[Soviet partisans]] while serving in the AK. After a [[kangaroo court]] trial, he was sentenced to death on 16 April 1952 by the presiding judge [[Maria Gurowska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=xAqUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=August+Emil+Fieldorf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiet7id_93ZAhUXS2MKHcLXAKgQ6AEIRDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=August%20Emil%20Fieldorf&amp;f=false|title=Transitional Justice in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union: Reckoning with the Communist Past|last=Stan|first=Assistant Professor of Political Science Lavinia|last2=Stan|first2=Lavinia|date=2009-01-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135970994|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal to a higher court failed, and the family's plea for a pardon was denied by then the communist leader [[Bolesław Bierut]] who refused to grant [[clemency]]. The sentence was carried out, by hanging, on 24 February 1953 at 3:00 pm in the infamous [[Mokotów Prison]] in Warsaw.

The Communist Prosecuting Attorney [[Wiktor Gattner]] described General Fieldorf's last moments as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I asked the condemned if he had any wishes. Fieldorf responded: 'Please notify my family'. I stated that his family would be notified [...] The condemned persistently looked straight into my eyes. He stood erect. No one was holding him. He made an appearance of a very strong man. One would almost admire his composure amidst such dramatic events. He neither screamed, nor made any gestures. I said: Carry out [the execution]! The executioner and one of the guards approached the condemned […] I went to see the warden afterwards, and then by my own hand I prepared the protocol of the execution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

General Fieldorf's body was never returned to his family, and remains buried in an unknown location to this day. In 2009, an article in a British newspaper suggested that Fieldorf was buried in a mass grave in a Warsaw cemetery, together with the remains of 248 other murdered Polish non-communists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/5887700/Secret-grave-of-Polish-hero-discovered.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:August Emil Fieldorf Nil monument.JPG|thumb|right|Symbolic grave of August Emil Fieldorf at [[Powązki Cemetery]]]]

In 1958 the prosecutor's office discontinued any further investigations.

== Rehabilitation and recognition ==
In 1972 a statue was erected on his symbolic grave.

In 1989, following the collapse of [[People's Republic of Poland|Communist Poland]], Fieldorf was officially rehabilitated.

In 2006 President [[Lech Kaczyński]] posthumously awarded him the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]]. In 2012 the supposed mass grave site was to be searched for Fieldorf's remains.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18980875 BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Search for justice ===
[[File:August fieldorf pomnik park jordana krakow.jpg|thumb|269x269px|Fieldorf statue, Cracow]]
Fieldorf's daughter, [[Maria Fieldorf Czarska]], called for the prosecutor responsible for the execution of her father, Helena Wolińska-Brus (who lived in [[Oxford]], England until her death in 2008), to be brought to face justice in Poland. Wolińska, a military prosecutor in the 1950s, was accused of aiding in the investigation and trial that resulted in Fieldorf's execution. Wolińska signed Fieldorf's arrest warrant and extended his detention several times, although she was aware of his innocence. A 1956 report issued by the communist authorities concluded that Wolińska had violated the rule of law and was involved in mock investigations and show trials that frequently resulted in executions. The charges against her were initiated by the [[Institute of National Remembrance]], which claimed that Wolińska was an "accessory to a court murder", which is classified as a Stalinist crime, and is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The case attracted international attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol8num1-2/constitutionwatch/poland.html East European Constitutional Review], [[New York University School of Law]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom refused to extradite her, and Wolińska-Brus died on 26 November 2008 without being brought to justice. 

Speaking about other individuals who have had complicity in the [[court-sanctioned murder]] (that is of fabricated evidence) of her father, Maria Fieldorf-Czarska said:

''I can neither allow the investigation [into the murder] of my father to be closed, nor to allow the following individuals to escape justice: the Deputy Director of Justice at the General Prosecutors' Office, [[Alicja Graff]], the Prosecuting Attorney, [[Wiktor Gattner]], and the Interrogator, Kazimierz Gorski. They could have refused [to take part in my father's murder]. No one forced them either physically or psychologically [to do it]. I demand that the people who murdered my father be brought to justice [...] I dream of Poland, whose institutions of justice are transparent and worthy of true respect and confidence. These types of institutions ought to be the foundation of a sovereign nation. I would want us, Poles, so much, to be able to choose our own examples to follow, and not those promoted by others.''

'''Finance Watch''' is a European non-governmental organization that conducts research and advocacy on [[financial regulation]].  Based in [[Brussels]], the organization focuses on financial regulation in the [[European Union]] and its member states.

Finance Watch was founded in 2011 by members of the [[European Parliament]] as a counterbalance to the financial lobby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/1542771-finance-watch-lobby-break-lobbies "Finance Watch – a lobby to break the lobbies"]. [[Der Tagesspiegel]] (English translation). 23 February 2012. Retrieved 1 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is "to strengthen the voice of society in the reform of financial regulation by conducting advocacy and presenting public interest arguments to lawmakers and the public as a counterweight to the private interest lobbying of the financial industry".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?site124/ "Finance Watch"]. Listing on FnWG. Retrieved 1 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Finance Watch was founded on 30 June 2011 as a consequence of a petition initiated in June 2010 by 22 &lt;ref&gt;[http://finance-watch.org/press/press-releases/344-signatories/ "Signatories"]. Finance Watch website. Retrieved 7 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; members of the European Parliament, including members of all major political groups ([[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (European Parliament group)|ALDE]], [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP]], [[Greens-EFA]], [[GUE/NGL]], and [[S&amp;D]]). This call for action was signed by another 140 elected officials from across Europe, and led to an exploratory project funded by the initiators, which in turn resulted in the founding General Assembly on 30 June 2011. [[Ieke van den Burg]], a former [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], was appointed Chair of the Board of Directors and Thierry Philipponnat, a former banker and [[Amnesty International]] executive in France, became the Secretary General. In January 2017, Benoît Lallemand became Secretary General.

==Activities==
The organization's research team analyses financial regulation and formulates policy recommendations. Its views are then communicated to policymakers by its advocacy team, who also cooperate with member organizations who share the same views, and to the wider public by its communication team. 
Examples of dossiers that Finance Watch deals with are capital requirements for banks (the [[Basel III]] agreement), banking structure (the [[Liikanen report|Liikanen Consultation]]), [[high-frequency trading]], food and resource speculation, and protection of retail investors. Finance Watch also organizes conferences about financial regulation issues, where different stakeholders of the financial sector interact in public.

==Structure and financing==
Finance Watch is an international association under Belgian law&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance-watch.org/about-us/ "About us"]. Finance Watch website. Retrieved 7 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ([[AISBL]]), and has two types of members: individuals and civil society organizations. The latter include [[Consumer protection|consumer groups]], [[trade unions]], [[housing associations]], [[Environmentalism|environmental NGOs]], [[International development|development NGOs]] and others. Each member has an equal vote at the organization’s general assembly.  To become a member, both individuals and civil society organizations need to prove to the organization’s Committee of Transparency and Independence that they are independent from the financial industry. Individual members also need to qualify for membership by showing they have relevant experience and expertise. The members convene at least once a year for a General Assembly. During the year, the General Assembly is represented by the Board of Directors. The Board comprises eight Directors including six elected by and from the General Assembly (four Member organisations and two individual Members) and two independent Directors (“external personalities”).

Members of the Finance Watch board of directors as of June 2017:&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance-watch.org/about-us/governance-and-funding "Governance and Funding"]. Finance Watch website. Retrieved 14 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chair: Prof. Dr. Rainer Lenz (Professor for International Finance, [[:de:Fachhochschule Bielefeld|Fachhochschule Bielefeld]])
* Vice-chair: Morten Clausen, [[UNI Europa]]
* Fran Boait, [[Positive Money]]
* Grégoire Niaudet, [[Secours Catholique]]
* Rainer Geiger, Attorney-at-law
* Andrea Baranes, Fondazione Banca Etica

Board Directors from outside the Membership (“external personalities”):
* Marc Roche (author, financial journalist)
* Professor Eric De Keuleneer (professor of economic regulation and banking at the Solvay School of the Université Libre de Bruxelles)

The organization’s budget has as its main sources project funding from the [[European Union]] and grants from several charitable foundations: Adessium Foundation, Fondation pour le progrès de l’homme, [[:de:Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung]], Better Markets, Open Society Initiative for Europe, as well as individual donations and members’ fees and contributions.

==Principles==
The declared mission of Finance Watch is “to strengthen the voice of society in the reform of financial regulation by conducting advocacy and presenting public interest arguments to lawmakers and the public as a counterweight to the private interest lobbying of the financial industry”.

The organization states it follows six principles&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance-watch.org/about-us/ "About us"]. Finance Watch website. Retrieved 7 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; in the pursuit of this mission:

# The role of the financial industry (allocating capital, managing risk and providing financial services) has strong public interest implications. 
# The primary role of finance is to allocate capital to productive use. 
# Finance must serve the real economy, not the inverse.
# Banks are legitimate in pursuing profits to ensure their sustainability, but profits should not harm public interest.
# Credit risk should not be transferred to society at large.
# The real economy needs to have access to capital and financial services, in a sustainable, equitable and transparent manner.

==Opposition==
[[Feargal Sharkey]], Head of [[UK Music]] and former lead singer of [[The Undertones]], gave evidence to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee]] in November 2008 stating that "We learned that the Metropolitan Police, in conjunction with an organization called London Councils - a representative body for all London borough - at the end of last year jointly wrote to all 33 local London boroughs recommending that they insert some particular wording into their local licensing policy statements."  He added that the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]] in west London, "tries to make a direct connection not only between crime and disorder and live music, but most astonishingly - I'm still knocked over in disbelief - between live music and the prevention of terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/media/pdf/r/6/Licensing_Policy.pdf |title= Statement of Licensing Policy|publisher   = London Borough of Hillingdon |date = January 2008|accessdate  = 21 February 2009 |format = PDF |pages = 7 | |deadurl     = yes  |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110608211242/http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/media/pdf/r/6/Licensing_Policy.pdf   |archivedate = 8 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=21 November 2008|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sharkey an afternoon school charity concert in a public park had been cancelled because organisers could not supply the details of the young performers.&lt;ref name=Orlowski /&gt;

[[Jon McClure]], lead singer with [[Reverend and the Makers]], set up a petition on the [[UK]] [[Prime Minister]]'s website to allow protest against what he alleges as "racial discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/jon-mclure-protests-form-696|title=Jon McLure Protests Form 696 - Musicians Set Up Petition|publisher=Clash Music|date=2 December 2008|accessdate=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement on their web site, The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters CEO Patrick Rackow stated "...the imposition of Form 696 on live music is likely to discourage the existence and growth of live music. Music has long been a positive form of free expression, for people from all walks of life to create and enjoy. This form appears to single out certain genres of music and ethnic audiences and therefore the Academy cannot support it.”&lt;ref&gt;

In December 2008, Mike Howlett, Chairman of the Music Producers Guild (UK), wrote to the General Secretary of the Musicians Union "In keeping with the Musicians Union and UK Music, we feel this is a gross infringement of civil liberties and a form of racial discrimination. We also feel that this will deter the staging of live musical events, stifle free expression and possibly penalise certain genres of music and ethnic audiences. Our members are horrified that this legislation, introduced in 2006, is being enforced under the guise of public law and order. We see no reason why artists and/or venue owners and managers should be forced to comply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpg.org.uk/news_stories/102|title=MPG letter of Support towards MU to stop form 696|publisher=Music Producers Guild|date=12 December 2008|accessdate=8 March 2009|last=Howlett
|first=Mike}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police position==
David Isles, Detective Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police Clubs and Vice unit has stated that Form 696 is not designed to stop people having a good time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20081203_form696.shtml|title=Form 696 fury|publisher=BBC 6 Music News|accessdate=2009-02-21}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Metropolitan Police web site describes the form as a ''Promotion Event risk assessment form''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://content.met.police.uk/Article/Organising-a-promotion-or-event/1400002385589/1400002385589|title=Metropolitan Police Service - Events
|publisher=Metropolitan Police Service|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detective Chief Superintendent Richard Martin stated that the original form, with its questions relating to audience ethnicity "was removed just because I don't think it added any value to the form.... We take account of where the event is playing, what other events might be playing nearby, the type of music that's being played, and whether there have been problems before. We've had quite a few of what I consider 'higher risk events', where there may be some problems - so we recommend additional searching processes and additional security to help manage the event safely."&lt;ref name=guardian20090129 /&gt; "It's not about being risk averse, it's about managing the risk," he said. "If you're a publican and you are just having some performers to entertain your regular customers, you won't be expected to do a risk assessment. It's for when the performance is being put on to draw people in. We will never assess somebody just on the genre of music they are performing. There is a whole raft of factors that are taken into account."&lt;ref name=independent20081121 /&gt;

==Form revised==
In September 2009, the Metropolitan Police announced "that venues would no longer be asked for details of the music style. A requirement to provide the telephone number of the performing artist will also be dropped and an independent "scrutiny panel" will be set up to ensure that the form is not misused."&lt;ref name=guardian7-9&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/sep/07/met-police-form-696-clubs|title=Met police bows to pressure to drop question on 'racist' form 696|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 September 2009|accessdate=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feargal Sharkey]] described this as an "exercise in semantics" and called for the form to be completely scrapped. He added that "it was clear that the altered version continued to target musicians from ethnic minorities and he objected strongly to a question which asks about the 'make-up of the patrons'."&lt;ref name=guardian7-9/&gt;

==Form 696 scrapped==
On 10 November 2017, it was announced that the use of Form 696 was to be discontinued in London following a review called for by [[Mayor of London]] [[Sadiq Khan]].&lt;ref name="Independent 10 November 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/form-696-scrapped-racist-police-paperwork-claims-london-mcs-djs-grime-garage-a8048821.html|title= Form 696: Police scrap 'racist' risk assessment for MCs and DJs| last= Nerssessian| first= Joe |date= 10 November 2017|website= www.independent.co.uk |publisher= [[The Independent]] | accessdate= 10 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 10 November 2017"/&gt; Reporting the decision, the BBC noted, "The Met denied the form had been used to target particular genres but said it had decided to drop it after a fall in 'serious incidents' at music events"; however, the BBC also reported that a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information]] request earlier in 2017 had discovered that 16 other English police forces were using forms similar to Form 696.&lt;ref name="BBC 10 November 2017"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2912">In many [[parliament]]s and other similar assemblies, seating is typically arranged in banks or rows, with each [[political party]] or [[caucus]] grouped together.  The [[spokesman|spokespeople]] for each group will often sit at the front of their group, and are then known as being on the '''frontbench''' (or '''front bench''') and are described as frontbenchers.  Those sitting behind them are known as [[backbencher]]s. Independent and minority parties sit to the side or on benches between the two sides, and are referred to as [[crossbencher]]s.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[British House of Commons]], the [[Government]] frontbench is traditionally called the Treasury bench ([[HM Treasury]] is the oldest government department). The government frontbench is on the right hand side as seen by the Chairman (typically the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] or the [[Lord Speaker]]), and is occupied by Government [[Political minister|minister]]s.  The [[Official Opposition frontbench|opposition frontbench]] is occupied by ''shadow'' ministers, of which the most senior form the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]].

==Canada==
While backbenchers are referred to in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] (and the provincial legislatures), the front seats on the government side are reserved for cabinet ministers. Front row members are not referred to as frontbenchers, but as cabinet ministers. Some "frontbenchers" actually sit in the centre of the second row, so as to be seen directly behind the party leader during Question Period (and thus, in the television frame).

The same arrangement exists for each [[Legislative assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories|provincial legislature and territorial legislature of Yukon]]. In the case of [[Legislative Assembly of Nunavut|Nunavut]] and [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories|Northwest Territories]] where [[Consensus government in Canada|Consensus government]] with non-partisan makeup where ministers sits amongst regular members.

==Ireland==
A [[front bench (Ireland)|front bench]] in [[Dáil Éireann]], the [[lower house]] of the [[Oireachtas]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]], refers to any organised group of party members who holds any degree of speaking power (derived from the party) on specific issues. The [[Teachtaí Dála]] (TDs) who are members of the [[Government of Ireland]] constitute the government front bench, while the members of parties in declared opposition to the government constitute the opposition front bench.

'''''Gates Rubber Company v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd., et al.'''''&lt;ref&gt;167 F.R.D. 90 (D.C. Col. 1996), U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12423; a copy of the final opinion by U.S. Magistrate Judge O. E. Schlatter of May 1, 1996 is available as [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/digitaldiscovery/library/preservation/gates.html pdf. Document at Harvard Law (accessed 24.02.2015)]&lt;/ref&gt; is a decision by the [[United States District Court for the District of Colorado|U.S. district court for the District of Colorado]] from May 1, 1996. It is to be considered a landmark decision&lt;ref&gt;See Fred Chris Smith &amp; Erin E. Kenneally in John J. Barbara (Ed.) ''Handbook of Digital and Multimedia Forensic Evidence'' (2008 Humana Press) p 105)&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of [[expert witness]] court testimony in questions of [[electronic evidence]]&lt;ref&gt;It should be noted that in most cases dealing with computer evidence, the term "electronic" may be more suitable than "digital". Although both are often used synonymously, their semantic content is different (for further details see Burkhard Schäfer &amp; Stephen Mason in Stephen Mason et al. (eds.) ''The Characteristics of Electronic Evidence'' (Butterworth 2010), pp. 21–50).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[digital forensics]].

In a nutshell, the decision states that the authenticity&lt;ref&gt;It should be noted that this is just one of several criteria for evidence to be recognized as admissible in a legal proceeding. Namely the [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay-rule]] often excludes even authentic electronic evidence's admissibility in trial. For further prerequisites particularly concerning electronic evidence see ''Lorraine v. Markel Am. Ins. Co.'', 241 F.R.D. 554 (D. Md. 2007) and Jonathan D. Frieden &amp; Leigh M. Murray "The admissibility of electronic evidence under the federal rules of evidence" (2011) Richmond Journal of Law and Technology Issue 2, 1 - 39&lt;/ref&gt; of electronic evidence is accepted by courts only, if the party adducing the evidence complied with the newest technical standards of electronic evidence acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Acquisition is the process of actually collecting electronic data. For example, seizing a computer at a crime scene or taking custody of a computer in a civil suit is a part of the acquisition process as well as the copying of a computer's hard drive (see Larry E. Daniel &amp; Lars E. Daniel in Maxwell &amp;  Spielmann (eds.) ''Digital Forensics for Legal Professionals'' (2012 Elsevier) p 12)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, U.S. magistrate judge Schlatter commented on the factors he considered relevant in the process of weighing the qualifications of digital forensics experts when those present contrary opinions or conclusions to the court. Hence, ''Gates v Bando'' has set legal standards for examining [[electronic evidence]] that have remained relevant to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Chris Smith &amp; Rebecca Gurley Bace ''A Guide to Forensic Testimony: The Art and Practice of Presenting Testimony as an Expert Technical Witness'' (2002 Addison-Wesley Professional) p 262; in the similar case of ''Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v Metro Mark Products, Ltd.'' 43 F. Supp.2d 951 (N.D. Ill. 1999), both opposing digital forensics experts applied the best practice methods as describes in ''Gates v Bando''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The facts of the case ==

Gates Rubber Company and Bando Chemical Industries were both involved in the manufacture of industrial belts as direct competitors. Several defendants aside from Bando were former employees of Gates, who had signed written non-competition agreements before they left the company. In 1989, Gates learned that the latter used a [[computer program]] highly similar to one of its own, so that Gates suspected its former employees had stolen, copied and used it for Bando. Accordingly, Gates filed several actions on the grounds of [[unfair competition]], misappropriation of [[trade secrets]], [[Copyright infringement|infringement of copyright]], and [[breach of contract]].&lt;ref&gt;It should be noted that the facts have been shortened and summarized to a large extent in terms of the aspects relevant for the fields of electronic evidence and expert testimony.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the court proceedings, in 1992 Gates learned that N., one of its former employees, deleted a [[computer program]] from his computer at Bando, which Gates claimed to be an unauthorized copy of a copyright-protected software of his own. Furthermore, (and actually decisive as regards the influence of digital forensics in trial), N. also "deleted" several word-processing files on the same computer, testifying that he did not erase any materials relevant to the pending [[litigation]]. Consequently, Gates applied for [[Discovery (law)|disclosure]], in order to examine whether or not the defendant had maliciously deleted files in an attempt to destroy evidence. The court granted Gates a court order that allowed Gates to copy the hard drive of Newman's computer in order to obtain as much information as possible from the "deleted", but reconstructible files. Gates then assigned the technician V. to execute the copying of the hard drive, whereas he subsequently also appeared as Gate's [[expert witness]] in the court procedure.

In retrospect, the technical method V. applied to create a copy of the hard drive of N.'s computer as well as his formal professional qualification as a digital forensics expert (particularly in comparison to the expert witness summoned by the defendant) turned out to be the crucial aspects that were decisive for the outcome of Gates claims arising from Bando's alleged violation of disclosure obligations through [[Spoliation of evidence|spoliation]].

== Acquisition of electronic evidence ==

In the course of his examination, V. copied a [[software]] onto the [[hard drive]] of N.'s computer (which contained the evidentiary electronic files), in order to create a file-by-file copy of the hard drive. This conduct induced the court to extensively comment on the forensic methods that must be applied to electronic evidence to allow it to be used as a piece of evidence in court procedure:

First, the court stated  that  - as a general rule - any digital forensic examiner shall be obliged to ''"utilize the method which would yield the most complete and accurate results"''&lt;ref&gt;''Gates Rubber Company v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd., et al.'' 167 F.R.D. 90 (D.C. Col. 1996) p 17&lt;/ref&gt; in order to comply with the legal prerequisites in regard to the admissibility of evidence in court procedure. As a result, several organizations started to continuously publish best practice literature for electronic evidence acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. for public authorities in the U.S: [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/199408.pdf John Ashcroft, Deborah J. Daniels &amp; Sarah V. Hart ''Forensic Examination of Digital Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement'' (2004 U.S. Department of Justice) accessed 26.02.2015]; [http://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/2009/09/12/best-practices-in-digital-evidence-collection/ Paul Henry "Best practises in digital evidence collection" (September 12, 2009) accessed 26.02.2015]; [https://www.swgde.org/documents/Current%20Documents/2014-09-05%20SWGDE%20Best%20Practices%20for%20Computer%20Forensics%20V3-1 Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence ''SWGE Best Practises for Computer Forensics'' (SWGE 2014) accessed 26.02.2015]; for crime investigators in the UK see: [http://www.acpo.police.uk/documents/crime/2014/Revised%20Good%20Practice%20Guide%20for%20Digital%20Evidence_Vers%205_Oct%202011_Website.pdf ''ACPO Good Practice Guide for Digital Evidence'' (ACPO 2012) accessed 26.02.2015]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should be kept in mind that such a [[best practise]] prerequisite must be considered a dynamic procedural hurdle, as the technical requirements and possibilities in analyzing and copying [[digital data]] change with the underlying [[Computer hardware|hard-]] and software, and consequently the technical procedures to be applied in order to create a legally permissible piece of electronic evidence may change in the future.

Second, the judge held that the file-by-file copying procedure applied by Gates' forensic examiner fails to fulfil the court's "best practice" requirement. Instead, it had been necessary for a  [[Forensic science|forensic investigation]] ''de lege artis'' to copy the hard drive by means of creating an [[Disk image|image]] (or: [[Disk mirroring|mirror]]) copy:

''"Gates retained V. as its technician to do the copying, and he attempted to do this through the use of a program called Norton's Unerase. Proper use of the program could yield information, or partial pictures, about files which were once present on the computer's hard drive, but were deleted.''

''Gates argued that V. did an adequate job of copying the Denver computer. W.'' (the defendant's expert witness, remark of author) ''persuaded me, however, that V. lost, or failed to capture, important information because of an inadequate effort. In using Norton's Unerase, V. unnecessarily copied this program onto the Denver computer first, and thereby overwrote 7 to 8 percent of the hard drive before commencing his efforts to copy the contents... Additionally, V. did not obtain the creation dates of certain of the files which overwrote deleted files. This information would have assisted in determining the deletion date of some files.''

''W. pointed out that V. should have done an "image backup" of the hard drive, which would have collected every piece of information on the hard drive, whether the information was allocated as a file or not. Instead, V. did a "file by file" backup, which copies only existing, nondeleted files on the hard drive. The technology for an image backup was available at the time of these events, though rarely used by anyone...''

''I find that the duty was on Gates, and not Bando, to utilize the best technology available."''&lt;ref&gt;''Gates Rubber Company v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd., et al.'' 167 F.R.D. 90 (D.C. Col. 1996) p 16 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standards outlined above have become the general standards in computer forensic examination.&lt;ref&gt;Smith &amp; Bace (n 4) p 7&lt;/ref&gt; According to these statements, electronic data, which is recovered from computer hard disk (or any other form of electronic storage unit for digital information) is permitted to be used in court procedures only, if the data is  duplicated and verified in a forensically sound manner. The forensic examiner in ''Gates v Bando'' (V.) failed to create such a forensically sound duplication since the [[Installation (computer programs)|installation]] of the examiner's software could have overwritten existing files on the hard drive, this is the constitution of the evidence was altered even before the copy was made. Correct duplication, however, requires that any alteration of the data during the process of copying is reliably excluded. This requires that:&lt;ref&gt;see: [http://www.electronicevidenceretrieval.com/preserving_protecting_evidence.htm Johnette Hassell &amp; Susan Steen "Preserving and protecting computer evidence" (2005) Evidence Technology Magazine (accessed 25.02.2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

# The image is an exact, bit-by-bit duplicate of the original computer drive,
# The image is taken in such a way as to guarantee that the original was not changed,
# The image is examined in such a way at to guarantee that the image is not changed.

In practise, proper duplication is usually warranted by [[write protection|write-blocking]] of the original storage device.&lt;ref&gt;see Larry E. Daniel &amp; Lars E. Daniel in Maxwell &amp;  Spielmann (eds.) Digital Forensics for Legal Professionals (2012 Elsevier) p 29 (with further explanation)&lt;/ref&gt; Correct verification means that the electronic evidence presented to the court must be provably identical to the one originally investigated, which usually is warranted by means of a [[Hash function|hash value]], an [[algorithm]] that calculated a number based on the content of the respective piece of electronic evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Larry E. Daniel &amp; Lars E. Daniel in Maxwell &amp;  Spielmann (eds.) Digital Forensics for Legal Professionals (2012 Elsevier) p 30&lt;/ref&gt; In the present, [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] with this "best practise" requirement can usually be achieved by using a [[proprietary software]] for imaging, as this will admittedly preserve the evidential value of the electronic information recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ro.ecu.edu.au/adf/41/ James Tetteh Ami-Narh &amp; Patricia A.H. Williams "Digital forensics and the legal system: a dilemma of our times" (2008) in ''Proceedings of the 6th Australian Digital Forensics Conference'' (Edith Cowan University 2008) p 5 (accessed 04.03.2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Assessment of evidential value in expert witness testimony of digital forensics experts ==

Expert qualifications are considered by both lawyers and experts to be very important, and in the case of ''Gates v  Bando'', the court reaffirms that widely accepted belief.&lt;ref&gt;Smith &amp; Bace (n 4)&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Schlatter stated in this context:

''"Bando's expert on matters associated with computer science was W., who holds a Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford. W.'s credentials, experience and knowledge were impressive, and I relied upon his opinions. Gates failed to obtain a similar expert in timely fashion. Gates did offer the testimony of V., the technician who was hired by Gates to copy the hard drive of the computer at Bando's Denver facility. His credentials, experience and knowledge were nowhere near those of W., and I placed much less weight on his testimony than on W.'s."''&lt;ref&gt;''Gates Rubber Company v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd.'', et al. Loc cit p 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The court strongly relied on the experts' formal professional qualification, as it was obviously the most distinguishable criterion in this case. However, most cases in litigation are not that unambiguous. Then, the factor of an expert's actual professional appearance - including but not limited to the ability to impart non-legal knowledge to the court, the thoroughness of the report and the traceability of the expert's inferences - will play a larger role. Additionally, a major practical issue for judges dealing with issues of electronic evidence remains in the lack of measurability of [[Information technology|IT]] expertise, partly due to the absence of uniform formal professional qualification&lt;ref&gt;Meanwhile, specific formal qualifications were introduced to certify a person's expertise in analyzing and creating reliable electronic evidence (e.g. the  [[Certified Forensic Computer Examiner]], the [[EnCase]] Certified Examiner, and the [[Global Information Assurance Certification|GIAC]] Certified Forensic Analyst). However, the variety of certificates available and the lack of their substantive conformity still make it hard for judges in practise to assess the actual expertise of a given expert witness as regards the broader field of IT&lt;/ref&gt; in this field.&lt;ref&gt;For further details on this issue see: John J. Barbara in John J. Barbara (ed.) ''Handbook of Digital and Multimedia Forensic Evidence'' (2008 Humana Press) p 25 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lessons for the future ==

The case of ''Gates v Bando'' surely highlights the necessity of selecting a given digital forensics expert carefully when it comes to civil litigation involving digital evidence issues, as such expert's opinion often turns out to be decisive for the outcome of a case. But the parties' [[due diligence]] in such cases even goes further: it is not only the selection of an expert witness in the litigation stage, but already in the pre-litigation phase attorneys and experts are obliged to ensure the correct acquisition of electronic evidence which is potentially relevant to their case. Moreover, they have to develop and apply an evidential reasoning that could both professionally withstand an opponent forensic expert's testimony and factually persuade the judge and/or the jury in the courtroom.

Apart from that, the course of the court procedure has (relatively early&lt;ref&gt;For an insight to the economically overwhelming significance of [[e-discovery]] in present litigation cases see: William P. Barnette "Ghost in the machine: zubulake revisited and other emerging e-discovery issues under the amended federal rules" (2012) Richmond Journal of Law and Technology Issue 3 1- 123&lt;/ref&gt;) illustrated the potential economic impact of [[E-discovery]] issues on litigation: originally initiated as a secondary theatre of war in an [[Intellectual property|IP]] litigation, these issues soon snowballed to a case of its own that finally achieved economically and temporally dimensions exceeding the original matter in dispute. Today, more than 90% of all corporate information is stored electronically.&lt;ref&gt;William P. Barnette "Ghost in the machine: zubulake revisited and other emerging e-discovery issues under the amended federal rules" (2012) Richmond Journal of Law and Technology Issue 3&lt;/ref&gt; Typically enough, digital forensics has become a big business with an estimated market value of 780 Mio. $ in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;John Salmons ''The Basics of Digital Forensics'' (Elsevier 2012) p 4&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, the outcome of an increasing number of cases in all fields of law will depend on issues of digital evidence.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.americanbar.org/publications/gp_solo/2014/september-october/authenticating_digital_evidence.html Paul W. Grimm "Authenticating digital evidence" (2014) 31 GP Solo Vol. 5 (accessed 26.02.2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

To the same extent which ''Gates v Bando'' illustrates the necessity for ligitation parties to carefully plan and execute a sophisticated strategy in terms of electronic evidence, however, it must be realized that it ultimately describes a recurrent practical problem: as IT and its relating tools and techniques will progress and the courts will (presumably) carry on to demand the application of the very best method available to warrant an electronic evidence's authentity, the absence of commonly court-accepted standards will emerge again and again. One potential solution for litigators to avoid the repeated occurrence of this issue might lie in entering into pre-trial agreements with their opponent, in which they agree upon certain conditions for the mutual recognition of their electronic documents' authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;See Zachary G. Newman &amp; Anthony Ellis "The reliability, admissibility, and power of electronic evidence" (2010) Pretrial Practice &amp; Discovery Issue 1, p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georgian nationality law''' is the law governing the acquisition, transmission and loss of [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[citizenship]].

==Naturalization as a Georgian==
Anyone who has stayed in Georgia for a total period of five years may apply for Georgian nationality. The applicant will be asked to undergo a language proficiency test which will also test the applicant's general knowledge of the history and the heritage of Georgia.

Foreign citizens may obtain Georgian citizenship after marrying a Georgian citizen. 
While applying for citizenship, the non-Georgian spouse should have a marriage anniversary certificate.  Having a child with the Georgian spouse would strengthen their case for naturalization.

==Temporary Residence permit==
Anyone who enters the Georgian states with a valid passport (or ID card for EU/Turkish citizens) and visa (where required) may ask for a temporary residence permit which may be extended up to a period of 6 years. The decision of giving the residence permit is totally up to the municipal government of the area in which the applicant resides. Generally people who come for medical treatment or business are warmly welcomed.

==Permanent residence permit==
Anyone who has stayed a period of 6 years in Georgia with a temporary residence permit may apply for a permanent residence permit.

==Visas and Residence permit==
Foreign staff of diplomatic missions and consular posts, as well as similar representations accredited to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] need [[Visa (document)|visas]] for their first entry to the territory of Georgia. During their accreditation period they stay in the country and cross the border on the basis of an accreditation card issued according to the determined rule of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia, if other is not provided by international obligation.

In cases determined by the Georgian legislation a visa/entry permit for up 90 days (visa fee 50 [[Georgian lari|GEL]]) or for 360 days (visa fee 100 GEL) can be issued by the Patrol Police of Georgia (sub-divisional institution of the Ministry of Internal Affairs) at border crossing points situated at the Georgian State Border.

The basis for the stay of an alien in Georgia is a visa or residence permit (permanent or temporary) if other is not provided by this law and international treaties of Georgia.

==Visa requirements for entering the Georgian territory==
The citizens of, and foreign nationals who permanently reside in, the [[Saudi Arabia|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]]  the [[United States]], the [[Republic of Lithuania]], [[Swiss Confederation]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Korea]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Republic of Hungary]], [[Poland|Republic of Poland]], [[Republic of Slovenia]], [[Kingdom of Denmark]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Kingdom of Norway]], [[Kingdom of Sweden]], [[Kingdom of Spain]], [[Republic of Bulgaria]], [[Slovak Republic]], [[Romania|Republic of Romania]], [[Mexico|United Mexican States]], [[Republic of Estonia]] and the [[Latvia|Republic of Latvia]] and who possess a document certifying permanent residence in one of these countries, do not need a visa to enter and stay in the territory of Georgia up to 360 days.

Foreign nationals, who have temporary residence document and reside in the territory of [[Qatar]], [[Sultanate of Oman]], [[Kingdom of Bahrain]] and State of [[Kuwait]] do not need a visa to enter and stay in the territory of Georgia up to 360 days.
The citizens of [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and foreign nationals residing in [[Saudi Arabia|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] having valid resident permit do not need a visa to enter and stay in the territory of Georgia up to 90 days.

Georgian, Turkish and EU citizens can enter Georgia on a national ID card.

Foreign nationals who are holders of the United Nations', or its specialized agencies', travel documents ([[United Nations laissez-passer|Laissez-Passer]]), can enter or stay in the territory of Georgia without a visa up to 90 days.

[[Taiwan]]ese passport holders are completely banned from entering Georgia.

== Special Nationality ==
An application for naturalization may be presented to the president of Georgia. The President has the right to grant Georgian nationality to anyone, including making that person a dual national, if he finds him important to the national interest of the state of Georgia. Those who receive Georgian citizenship in this manner, by decree of the president of Georgia, may keep their foreign nationality and become dual nationals of their other country and of Georgia.  Dual nationality is normally allowed for Georgians only in this specific case. This way of granting Georgian nationality also became a way for the President to enable ethnic Georgians who left Georgia during the Soviet era, and their descendants who had been born out of Georgia, to reunite with their ancestral homeland.  This is considered a national goal and in the state interest.

Keeping in consideration that granting the nationality to a particular person is beneficial for Georgia, such special nationality is granted without the need of fulfilling the 'residence and language' requirements.

==Travel freedom==

The '''German school of fencing''' (''{{lang|de|Deutsche Schule; Kunst des Fechtens}}''&lt;ref&gt;Note that the historical term ''Fechtschule'' "school of fencing" does not refer to the "German school" but to individual fencing ''competitions'' held in the early modern period, equivalent to the English ''[[Prize Playing]]s''.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a system of [[combat]] taught in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the [[Late Middle Ages|Late Medieval]], [[German Renaissance|Renaissance]], and [[Early Modern]] periods, as described in the contemporary [[Fechtbuch|Fechtbücher]] ("combat manuals") written at the time. 
The geographical center of this tradition was in what is now [[Southern Germany]] ([[Augsburg]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Nuremberg]]).
During the period in which it was taught, it was known as the ''{{lang|de|Kunst des Fechtens}}'', or the ''"Art of Fencing" (''commonly mistranslated as the ''"Art of Fighting").&lt;ref&gt;The [[Early Modern German]] ''fechten'' translates to the English etymological equivalent, [[:wikt:fight|to fight]]. In [[Modern German]], ''fechten'' has come to mean "[[:wikt:fencing|fencing]]",  but translating ''fechten'' as "fencing" in a pre-16th century context is an anachronism; the English verb "to fence" in the sense of "fighting with swords" arises in the 1590s, in [[Shakespeare]], in reference specifically to the [[Elizabethan]] ''[[Art of Defence]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}''
Though the German school of fencing focuses primarily on the use of the two-handed [[longsword]], it also describes the use of many other weapons, including [[polearms]], [[medieval dagger|daggers]], [[Messer (weapon)|messers]] (with or without a [[buckler]]), and the [[stick fighting|staff]], as well as describing [[mounted combat]] and [[ringen|unarmed grappling]].

Most authors of writings on the system are, or claim to be, in the tradition of the 14th-century master [[Johannes Liechtenauer]]. The earliest surviving treatise on Liechtenauer's system is a manuscript dated to 1389, known as [[3227a|Ms. 3227a]].
More manuscripts survive from the 15th century, and during the 16th century the system was also presented in print, most notably by [[Joachim Meyer]] in 1570.

The German tradition was largely eclipsed by the [[Dardi school|Italian school]] of [[rapier]] fencing by the early 17th century, however, practitioners of the German school persisted at least until the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Otto Adalbert Beneke |title=Von unehrlichen Leuten: cultur-historische Studien und Geschichten  |url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=6eEBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=Markus+Fechter+deutsche+Fechtkunst&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Markus%20Fechter%20deutsche%20Fechtkunst&amp;f=false |year=1857 |publisher=Berthes, Besser und Waufe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Wassmannsdorff |title=Sechs Fechtschulen (d. i.

Fencing with the German longsword has been a focus of [[historical European martial arts]] reconstruction since the late 19th century, when swordsmen such as [[Alfred Hutton]] first popularized the pursuit.

The term "the German school of fencing" can be misleading, because there were and are multiple styles of German fencing. For example, both German academic fencing and old German theatrical swordplay are referred to today as being of the "German school of fencing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich August Wilhelm Ludwig Roux |title=Deutsches Paukbuch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tPlBAAAAYAAJ |year=1857 |publisher=F.

==History==

===Late medieval tradition===
The first document of German heritage which shows fencing techniques is the ''[[Royal Armouries Ms. I.33]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = https://oleg-maltsev.com/ru/martial-arts/german/sources_of_german_fencing_part1/

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was written around 1300. The next documents date from approximately a century later, when records of the tradition attributed to the 14th-century master [[Johannes Liechtenauer]] begin to appear.

The history of the German school of fencing in the tradition of Liechtenauer spans roughly 250 years, or 8-10 generations of masters (depending on the dating of Liechtenauer) from 1350 to 1600. The earliest source, Ms. [[3227a]] of 1389, mentions a number of masters who are considered peers of Liechtenauer: Hanko Döbringer, Andres Jud, Jost von der Nyssen, and Niklaus Preuss. Martin Hundsfeld and [[Ott Jud]] were probably active in the early 15th century, but there is a scarcity of historical sources until the mid-15th century.

The mid-15th century saw the peak and decline of the "Society of Liechtenauer" under [[Peter von Danzig (fencer)|Peter von Danzig]], [[Sigmund Ringeck]], and [[Paulus Kal]]. Kal's contemporary, [[Hans Talhoffer]], may have been involved with the founding of the [[Brotherhood of St. Mark]], which enjoyed a quasi-monopoly on teaching martial arts from 1487 until 1570.

In 1514, Emperor Maximilian L. gave special privileges to both the Marksbrüder and much later to the Federfechter, and propagated the fencing style of Liechtenauer in the entire Holy Roman Empire (it became de facto the dominant martial arts within the Holy Roman Empire, despite the fact that there were others martial art schools active in the Empire at the time). The Emperor also granted students the right to bear arms and allowed them to have duels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ch/books?id=8AgE5xrvWHkC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Kaiser+Fechtgilden+Privilegien&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i2Lq2w1LE6&amp;sig=EagNrfmZsTyGkEy5QUhHmLrYnX4&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5kN-KrqbYAhWFExQKHemDDrkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Kaiser%20Fechtgilden%20Privilegien&amp;f=false] Kaiser, Fechtgilden und Privilegien&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fechtfibel.homepage.t-online.de/Fechtfibel.html] Die kleine Fechtfibel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.corps-arminia.de/verbindung/fechten/] Fechten&lt;/ref&gt;

===German Renaissance===
Late 15th-century masters include [[Johannes Lecküchner]], [[Hans von Speyer]], [[Peter Falkner]], and [[Hans Folz]]. In the 16th century, the tradition became more a sporting exercise than a system of combat for duelling or the battlefield. Early 16th-century masters include Hans Wurm, [[Jörg Wilhalm]], and Andre Pauernfeindt (also ''Paurnfeindt; Paurnfeyndt; Paurenfeyndt'')&lt;ref&gt;The occasional spelling Paurñfeyndt is due to a misinterpretation of the [[sigla|siglum]] indicating ''en'' as "ñ" and should be replaced by ''Paurenfeyndt''. The modern form of the surname is [[Bauernfeind]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1516, Pauernfeindt published a treatise entitled ''Ergründung der ritterlichen kunst des fechtens durch freyfechter czu Vienn'' ("Foundation of the knightly art of combat by the [[Freifechter]] of Vienna"), which is one of the earliest printed fencing manuals. Comparisons with descriptions in other manuscripts from the period (such as the [[Cologne Fechtbuch]]) confirm that this period was a transitional stage between the late medieval school of [[Johannes Liechtenauer]] and the [[German Renaissance]] "sportive" [[Feder (fencing)|Federfechten]] as practiced  in the late 16th century (as recorded in the later printed manuals by [[Joachim Meyer]] and others). A later manuscript, dated 1564 and attributed to  Lienhart Sollinger, cites Pauernfeindt and is largely identical in content.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Anglo, ''The Martial Arts of Renaissance Europe'', 2000, p 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, the ''Kunst des Fechtens'' could still be used for self-defense and never really became a fully combat sport. The term ''Versportlichung'' (the term describes the change from a combat system into a martial sport) as a mitigation of the fight sequences first appeared in the late 18th century, when fencing, mostly took place with the [[small sword]]. See {{cite web |title=Wir lernen Fechten |trans-title=We Learn Fencing |url=http://www.skg-im.net/Wir_lernen_Fechten.pdf |date=2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813031930/http://www.skg-im.net/Wir_lernen_Fechten.pdf |archive-date=13 August 2012|access-date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 16th century, the first attempts, notably by [[Paulus Hector Mair]], at preserving and reconstructing the teachings of the past century appeared. The foundation of the ''[[Federfechter]]'' in 1570 at [[Vienna]] falls into this late period. The final phase of the tradition stretches from the late 16th to the early 17th century, with masters such as [[Joachim Meyer]] and Jakob Sutor.

===Decline of the German tradition===
In the 17th century, [[rapier]] fencing of the [[Italian school of swordsmanship|Italian school]] became fashionable due to treatises by such as [[Salvator Fabris]], and the German tradition becoming regarded as old-fashioned and unrefined among the nobility during the Baroque. [[Longsword]] fencing was gradually discontinued at noble fencing schools, including most universities, at the time. The rapier had an advantage in that it could be worn well with the clothing of that time period when longswords were typically seen as too large to be worn fashionably. [[Thirty Years' War]] also led to a massive decline of both fencing schools and practitioners in the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kriegsreisende.de/neuzeit/soeldnerleben.htm]. Söldner im Dreißigjährigen Krieg&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Peter Hagendorf]] (a mercenary who fought in the Thirty Years' War) and [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen]] make references in their works to the excessive amount of deaths among the member of the traditional fencing guilds and the massive destruction of the regions in which they were active (this also explains why most of the surviving schools and lines where active in the eastern part of the Holy Roman Empire or in regions that were far less affected by the war).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mvonmueller.de/Magisterarbeit_MvM_01_02_2005.pdf] Wiktenauer.

Author Jean Daniel L'Ange writes in his book ''Deutliche und gründliche Erklärung der adelichen und ritterlichen freyen Fecht-Kunst'', from 1664 (another edition was published in 1708), that "a big sword is very dangerous in our times because it is more difficult to [carry] around with clothing than a smaller thrusting sword, which can easily be worn." He also writes that "it is possible to kill a man who is armed with a gun in a short range, when he stands close to you[,] with the help of the rapier, because of the highly effective thrusting techniques [that] will save your life, rather than with the slower cutting of a bigger sword or a sabre. You may even be able to kill him, before he can take his gun out of its halter, before he can make the first shot".&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/urn/urn:nbn:de:hbz:061:1-16895 Deutliche und gründliche Erklä – Titel – Digitale Sammlungen].

L'Ange also writes, "you can hide your rapier well under your mantle and thus avoid any provocation in public. A long sword may cause problems and excite enemies". But L'Ange also pays tribute to the Marksbrüder and states, "their art is truly a knightly science, it must be preserved for the coming, yet unborn generations!".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Deutliche_Erkl%C3%A5rung_der_Fechtkunst_(Jean_Daniel_L'Ange)/Images Deutliche Erklårung der Fechtkunst (Jean Daniel L'Ange)/Images] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130412042350/http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Deutliche_Erkl%C3%A5rung_der_Fechtkunst_(Jean_Daniel_L'Ange)/Images |date=2013-04-12 }}.

Fencingclassics.wordpress.com (2011-11-01). Retrieved on 2013-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some civilian fencers still practiced the German school instead of the rapier-fencing of the noble elite. The last known practitioner by name was Theodori Verolini&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Theodori_Verolini Theodori Verolini (wiktenauer.com)]. Wiktenauer.com (2013-02-02). Retrieved on 2013-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1679, when he published his book ''Der Kůnstliche Fechter'' ("The Artful Fencer"), which was based upon Joachim Meyers fechtbuch.

===Late survivals in the modern period===
There are paintings from the middle of the 18th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://fechtschule.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/image_2.jpg JPG image]. files.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt; that show practitioners still using long swords in the fencing schools of the Marxbrüder and Federfechter. It cannot be verified if these depictions are anachronistic or they show techniques and practices of the original Liechtenauer tradition still in use, although it is highly likely that most 18th century fencers were not at all familiar with longsword fencing and would likely not have known how to handle these weapons, which indicates that these pictures show lines of the Liechtenauer tradition that are referred in literature (and did continue to exist at least until the end of the 18th century / the early 19th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fechtschule; Germany, 18th ct. |url=http://fencingclassics.wordpress.com/2010/01/22/fechtschule-germany-18th-ct/ |date=22 January 2010 |website=The Secret History of the Sword (Fencingclassics.wordpress.com) |access-date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1726, Gottfried Rudolf Pommer auf Bugenhagen mentions, in his publication ''Sammlung von Merktwurdigkeiten'' ("Collection of Oddities"),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.phf.uni-rostock.de/institut/igerman/forschung/litkritik/litkritik/start.htm?/institut/igerman/forschung/litkritik/litkritik/Kritiker/AbKaestner.htm Projekt Literaturkritik].

Most fencers of the 18th century viewed longsword fencing as a curious thing, and it was probably only taught in the few remaining fencing schools of the Marxbrüder and Federfechter and in some stage fencing schools.&lt;ref&gt;Heidemarie Bodemer (2008) [http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/opus/volltexte/2008/3604/pdf/Fechtbuch.pdf as Fechtbuch].

In 1735, German historian [[Johann Gustav Gottlieb Büsching|Johann Büsching]] mentioned the existence of both the Brotherhood of St. Mark and the Federfechter as well as the existence of "Klopffechter" (artistic and stage fencers who used blunt weapons). He further stated that there were alive in 1817 at least a handful of skilled people who knew how to use "battle swords" ("Schlachtschwerter", another name for either longswords or Zweihänder).&lt;ref&gt;[http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/resolve/display/bsb10611438.html]. Wöchentliche Nachrichten für Freunde der Geschichte, Kunst und Gelahrtheit des Mittelalters Autor / Hrsg.: Büsching, Johann Gustav Gottlieb&lt;/ref&gt; Büsching goes on to say that the art was dying out very slowly, mostly due to the fact that there were fewer living fencers who were trained by the few remaining Marxbrüder und Federfechter.

The last of public displays of longsword fencing was on 5 November 1741, the author clearly mentions the use of "Schlachtenschwerter" ("battle swords"). The most prominent guest of this display was Friedrich II., holy Roman Emperor who enjoyed the presentation very much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Büsching |first=Johann Gustav |author-link=Johann Gustav Gottlieb Büsching |title=Ueber Fechtspiele und Fechtschulen in Deutschland |trans-title=On Fencing and Fencing Schools in Germany |url=https://www.schwertkampf-ochs.de/Essays/Ueber_Fechterspiele_und_Fechtschulen_in_Deutschland.pdf |date=1817 |website=Ochs – historische Kampfkünste e.V. |language=German |access-date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strangely enough, the public demonstrations of these fencing styles seem to end very abruptly, despite the big popularity they had among both noblemen and common citizens.

The collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, in 1806, and the wars and battles of the period destroyed several of the remaining old fencing schools and led to the death of many active fencers. It is possible that the Napoleonic wars brought an end to most of the remaining lines of the Liechtenauer tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fechtclub-rz.de/dl/Geschichte%20des%20Fechtens%20und%20des%20FCIR.pdf].

Another source mentions living longsword fencers who were alive in 1819, but who were "without any fencing schools" (a reference to the decline of both the Federfechter and the Marksbrüder).&lt;ref&gt;[http://heerlager-bundtschuh.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=21].

The very last known source who mentions living members of the Marksbrüder is the "Jagd-Zeitung" ("Hunting Newspapers") part 9 from 1866. The author Jos Baader, mentions living veterans of the old fencing schools who were still alive but very old (he mentions a gentleman who is in his late 80s, but was once a practitioner of their specific longsword fencing style).&lt;ref&gt;[file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Ordnung_der_Federfechter.pdf].

There were some living German longsword fencers alive during the lifetime of [[Alfred Hutton]], a British fencer of the 19th century who was interested into the reconstruction of old fencing systems. Hutton could have met some living longsword fencers and interviewed them. He could have preserved at least a part of their knowledge, if he had been to Germany and met the last living Marksbrüder members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historisches Fechten |trans-title=Historic Fencing |url=https://www.freifechter.org/historisches-fechten/ |website=Die Freifechter |language=German |access-date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bachmann |first=D. |title=HEMA |trans-title= |url=http://schwertfechten.ch/hema/ |date=2015 |website=Kunst des Fechtens |language=German |access-date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some aspects and basics—such as the Huten, the basic four guards of the Liechtenauer traditions, and some terminology (terms such as "Schrankhut" and "Langort" can still be found in rare German stage fencing literature of the 19th and early 20th centuries), as well as the four basic cuts and the thrusts from all guards of medieval German longsword fencing—survived in some classic German stage fencing schools ("Bühnenfechtkunst") at least until the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ch/books?id=JbTBGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=B%C3%BChnenfechtunst&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIpJW5ysPYAhVGthQKHRZgAqsQ6AEIJjAA Bühnenfechtkunst, I.

The close relationship between longsword fencers of the Liechtenauer tradition and stage fencers can be traced back at least until the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.schwertkampf-ochs.de/Essays/Kiermayer_Schwerttanz.pdf Schwertanz von Alexander Kiermayer&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of [[Nazi Germany|the third Reich]], there was an interest among certain members of the [[NSDAP]] to conserve classical German stage fencing and to teach specifically longsword fencing techniques to young boys who were in the [[Hitlerjugend]], under the name "Ritterspiele" ("Knightly Games").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baden.at/cms/upload/abteilungen/bildung_kultur/rollettmuseum/katalogblaetter/Katalogblatt_Nr._19_Baden_1939.pdf Baden 1939&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hss.de/download/publications/Leitfaden_Bayerische-Landesgeschichte.pdf Bayrische Landesgeschichten&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edoweb-rlp.de/resource/edoweb:4243521/data Geschichte der alterwürdigen Burg Waldeck&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mindhost.tumblr.com/post/141843140312/from-wiktenauer-the-exploits-of-19th-century Ritterliche Waffenspiele, Schwert- und Stock-fechten, Bogenschiessen, Armbrustschiessen, Bau von Übungswaffen.

Wilhelm Fabricius (1894-1989), a silviculture scientist and passionate admirer of historical martial arts and fencing even wanted to reconstruct German medieval fencing on the basis of traditional stage fencing and the Fechtbuch of [[Joachim Meyer]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ch/books?id=pyDGiksrYH8C&amp;pg=PA429&amp;lpg=PA429&amp;dq=Wilhelm+Fabricius+Ritterliche+Waffenspiele&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x1kmTOi1AY&amp;sig=t7wAczzBAaxlx_OClUb-AAm-hwc&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitw8ySgorZAhVB2BQKHQjJAIcQ6AEIQjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Wilhelm%20Fabricius%20Ritterliche%20Waffenspiele&amp;f=false Ein Kampf für das Recht der Musen: Leben und Werk von Karl Christian Müller, Page 429&lt;/ref&gt; Fabricius was later captured by American troops, it is unclear whether or not he continued his reconstruction efforts after the war, although there is evidence that his interest in the subject never faded.&lt;ref&gt;http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=1390 Wilhelm Fabricius&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.epb.uni-hamburg.de/kuk2012/files/2012/02/Coesfeld_3.Reich_.pdf Kampfsport im Dritten Reich&lt;/ref&gt; The very last references and active lines of these techniques in classical German stage fencing vanished almost entirely with the [[World War II|second world war]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ch/books/about/Ritterliche_Waffenspiele_Schwert_und_Sto.html?id=dRmvtgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Ritterliche Waffenspiele : Schwert- und Stockfechten, Bogenschießen, Armbrustschießen, Bau von Übungswaffen, Wilhelm Fabricius Holzinger, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ch/books?id=MPBQAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=theaterfechten+deutsch&amp;dq=theaterfechten+deutsch&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiyy-nNz8PYAhXMyKQKHczQAxMQ6AEIQTAF Theater heute, E.

After the war, Germans started to vastly prefer modern American stage fencing (which was a mix between 19th century saber fencing and some East Asian martial arts techniques), probably due to the popularity of Hollywood movies in Germany after the second world war. Unfortunately, classical German stage fencing became more and more rare and its practitioners started to die out.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ch/books?id=AvZFDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=entnazifizierung+fechten&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-uUci49-iQ&amp;sig=J_Asc-NJsu5vjMDMWjGB0TKoY9s&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_9PrU5ubYAhUEXBQKHcTvCSEQ6AEIQTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=entnazifizierung%20fechten&amp;f=false Fechten in der SS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ch/books?id=Xv0kDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1796&amp;lpg=PA1796&amp;dq=entnazifizierung+fechten&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PMj0XD3Asw&amp;sig=zR_AdqCAULzcrnzaB6Zvqh5Q4hw&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_9PrU5ubYAhUEXBQKHcTvCSEQ6AEIRzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=entnazifizierung%20fechten&amp;f=false Die Bundeswehr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uni-bonn.de/die-universitaet/historischer-kalender/2006/historischer-kalender-2006.pdf Der historische Kalender 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://doczz.nl/doc/994840/stadtchronik-1950-bis-1964 Stadtchronik 1950 bis 1964&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, almost all of the practitioners of this classical style of stage fencing either have died or would be very old.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mittelalter-abc.de/gruppen-vereine/bund-deutscher-buehnenkampfmeister/ Klassische, deutsche Bühnenfechtunst&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the only surviving part of the medieval German school of fencing can be found in modern German [[Academic fencing]], where some of the old terminologies (for example: swords are divided into parts called "Stärke" and "Schwäche", the term "Anhauen" and the saying "in die Schranken weisen" are directly descended from the medieval German fencing terminology of the Liechtenauer canon) and traditions (such as the unbroken line of German Fencing masters which reaches back to the medieval period) are still active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W.

==Spread==
The geographical origin of the tradition of Liechtenauer is difficult to establish. There are several places called "Lichtenau" in Germany, and Ms. 3227a states explicitly that Johannes Liechtenauer traveled widely to learn from as many masters as possible.&lt;ref&gt;GNM 3227a: ''Aber man wird noch manchen Leichmeister finden, der da spricht, das er selber eine neue Kunst gefunden hat und meinen das Ihr glaubt, dass sich die Kunst des Fechtens von Tag zu Tag verbessern würde. Aber ich würde gerne einen sehen, der ein Gefecht oder einen Hau erdenkt den es nicht in Lichtenauers Kunst gegeben hat''  "But you will still find some "sporting" master, who says, that he himself has created a new art of fencing. But I want to see one of these men, who has created a technique, that is not included in master Lichtenauers art" http://www.lupi-venaritis.de/EuropKamfK/Dokumente/120105%20Lichtenauer%20Druckausgabe.pdf {{dead link|date=August 2017|reason=not at Archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lupi-venaritis.de/EuropKamfK/Dokumente/080317%20D%F6rbringer%20%DCbersetzung.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of course, it is to be assumed that there were traditions of combat training throughout the medieval world, in spite of the [[Argument from silence|absence of evidence]] of their details. What is now known as the "German school" comprises those traditions which were put on paper in the late medieval period, and this tradition of compiling written manuals or ''epitomes'' of fighting systems appears to mostly have been confined to [[Southern Germany]].
From about the same time, early records of the [[Italian school of fencing]] document the German school, beginning with the writings of [[Fiore dei Liberi]], who mentions a master of Swabia called Johannes "who was a student of Nicholai of Toblem."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejmas.com/jwma/articles/2008/jwmaart_cvet_0908.htm Journal of Western Martial Art]. Ejmas.com. Retrieved on 2013-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the medieval period, emerging traditions of [[history of fencing|fencing]], i.e. the early modern rapier systems, as opposed to the generic systems of "combat" or "fighting" of the late medieval period, developed in close contact with each other, which led to the separate but closely related rapier styles of Italy, Spain, and later France, all of which were also well received in Germany. For example: Paulus Hector Mair describes a Spanish style of rapier fencing in his book on fencing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dfg-viewer.de/show/?set%5Bimage%5D=111&amp;set%5Bzoom%5D=default&amp;set%5Bdebug%5D=0&amp;set%5Bdouble%5D=0&amp;set%5Bmets%5D=http%3A%2F%2Fdaten.digitale-sammlungen.de%2F~db%2Fmets%2Fbsb00007894_mets.xml DFG-Viewer &gt; De arte athletica II – BSB Cod.icon. 393(2]. Dfg-viewer.de. Retrieved on 2013-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15th century Liechtenauerian tradition seems to have been geographically centered on [[Swabia]] and [[Franconia]], and influenced development in the adjacent territories, including [[Alsace]], the [[Rhineland]], the [[Seventeen Provinces|Lowlands]], [[Bohemia]], and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]]. In the 16th century, there was an established tradition of [[Federfechten]] competitions. The dominant guild were the [[Brotherhood of St. Mark]] which held their annual meeting in [[Frankfurt]]. After 1570, there was a second influential guild, the [[Federfechter]], which apparently originated in the southeastern part of the empire ([[Prague]], [[Vienna]]). Masters or treatises of the period that can be located geographically include:

*the oldest surviving manual, [[Royal Armouries Ms. I.33]] of c. 1300, originates in [[Franconia]]
*the oldest record of the Liechtenauerian tradition, [[Nürnberger Handschrift GNM 3227a]], appears to exhibit [[East Central German]] dialectal elements. By 1495, this manuscript had been acquired by [[Nicolaus Pol]] of [[Innsbruck]]
*[[Hans Talhoffer]], in the 1440s to 1460s, was active throughout Southern Germany, including [[Königsegg]], [[Emerkingen]], and [[Zürich]]
*[[Johannes Lecküchner]] was active in [[Nuremberg]] in the 1460s; [[Hans Folz]] also was in Nuremberg in the late 15th to early 16th century. [[Albrecht Dürer]] compiled a manual on [[Ringen|grappling]] in c.1505.
*[[Cgm 558]], written in what is now Switzerland, most likely the [[Toggenburg]], shortly before 1500.
*the [[Cologne Fechtbuch]] of [[Cologne]] or surroundings, c.1510.
*[[Christian Egenolph]] of [[Frankfurt]] was active in the 1520s 
*[[Paulus Hector Mair]] of [[Augsburg]] was active in the 1540s. [[Jörg Wilhalm]] was also in Augsburg, active during the 1540s to 1560s.
*[[Joachim Meyer]] was active in the 1570s in [[Strasbourg]].

Karl Ludwig Blum mentioned that there were traveling masters, who gave lectures to noblemen in the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].{{year needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blum |first=Karl Ludwig |title=Ein russischer Staatsmann: Des Grafen Jakob Johann Sievers Denkwürdigkeiten zur Geschichte Rußlands, Band 1 |trans-title=A Russian statesman: The Count Jakob Johann Sievers's Memorabilia on the History of Russia, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=EpVKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA38 |page=38 |date=1857 |location=Leipzig, Heidelberg |publisher=C.

In spite of the surging popularity of the Italian and Spanish rapier, elements of the German tradition survived well into the 17th century. Even in 1614, many fencing masters based their fighting styles on the tradition. An example is would-be master Joachim Meyer, who based his early rapier fencing on Lichtenauers principles, which was considered to be the most effective and efficient school of fencing.&lt;ref&gt;http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN575033789&amp;IDDOC=323474 http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/resolve/display/bsb10481803.html&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that, in the second half of the 16th century, at least a handful of German long sword fencers (Marksbrüder) traveled to England and gave fencing lessons. Frederic Hervey said that "the Imperial German fencers came to Britain to teach their Anglo-Saxon brethren the old and knightly art of fencing". However, it can be assumed that few fencers in Britain received such training.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ch/books?id=iL0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Fechtschulen+britanniens&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0ucn4r5nYAhXKaRQKHflxAKsQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Fechtschulen%20britanniens&amp;f=false Geschichte der Schiffahrt und Seemacht Gross-Britanniens&lt;/ref&gt; One source mentions a "nobleman named Alberth", from Britain, who was experienced in the German school of longsword fencing, and who was also trained in a Spanish school of swordsmanship, either an early rapier-fencing school of [[La Verdadera Destreza]] or a surviving Spanish Medieval school of fencing).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ch/books?id=b2YvAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Fechtkunst+England&amp;dq=Fechtkunst+England&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgguHssJnYAhWB1xQKHWi8CVsQ6AEIJzAA Die Fechtkunst im XV. und XVI.

One German source states: "the young prince (Louis XIV) was very excited by the stage fencing provided by fencers from his mothers fatherland. When they were finished with the swordplay, he (Louis XIV) clapped loudly and asked for more (stage fights and friendly bouts)" (Note: Anne of Austria, the mother of Louis, was a Spanish princess from the Holy Roman Empire, given that the Liechtenauer tradition was both the most widely practiced and officially recognised form of fencing in the Holy Roman Empire, it is very likely that these fencers were practitioners of the Liechtenauer tradition).&lt;ref&gt;http://mvdok.lbmv.de/mjbrenderer?id=mvdok_document_00002645 Jahrbücher des Vereins für Mecklenburgische Geschichte und Altertumskunde, Band 41 (1876)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ch/books?id=WjtKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA107&amp;lpg=RA1-PA107&amp;dq=Fechten+franz%C3%B6sischer+Hof&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zZ3v9PbPJc&amp;sig=4-H8y0N1YowsAxXek8kCQHLUwSM&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie36XBtLfYAhUBcRQKHRDvC2EQ6AEIQjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Fechten%20franz%C3%B6sischer%20Hof&amp;f=false Churfürstlich-Pfalzbaierischer Hof- und Staatskalender&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disciplines==
Master Johannes Liechtenauer based his system of fencing upon the use of the [[Longsword]].  He used this weapon to exemplify several overarching martial principles that also apply to other disciplines within the tradition.  ''Ringen'' (wrestling/grappling) was taught, as well as fighting with the [[Großes Messer|messer]], and staff.  Also part of the curriculum was fighting with the [[dagger]] ''Degen'' (mainly the [[roundel dagger]]) and with [[pole weapons]]. Two other disciplines besides ''Blossfechten'' involved the sword: fencing with (single-handed) sword and [[buckler]] (or a large shield in the case of [[judicial combat]] according to [[Schwabenspiegel|Swabian law]]), and armored fighting (''Harnischfechten''), the latter reserved only for nobility.

==First principles==
[[Johannes Liechtenauer]]'s teachings as recorded in [[3227a]] are introduced by some general principles (foll. 13–17).
The anonymous author explicitly states that Liechtenauer had cast his teaching in opaque verses intended to hide their meaning from the uninitiated.
He stressed that there is "only a single art of the sword" which had been the same for centuries and which is the kernel and foundation of all arts of combat.

*the principle of taking the shortest and most direct line of attack (''of das aller neheste vnd kors körtzste / slecht vnd gerade czu'') disregarding flourishes or flashy parrying techniques (''mit dem höbschen paryrn vnd weit vmefechten'').
*the difficulty of explaining techniques in words and the importance of direct instruction and intensive training, offering the aphorism that "exercise is better than art, because exercise without art is useful, but art without exercise is useless" (15r).
*the importance of footwork and stance (15v) and of correct distance (''mosse'', 15v) and speed of motion (16r)
*the importance of taking the offensive (''vorslag'', 14v, 16r-16v) with a fixed plan of attack
*the tactical importance of hiding the intended action from the opponent (16r)

The text goes on to present the core principles of successful swordsmanship in eight rhyming couplets (17v):
{|class="wikitable"
|-
|1.  the help of God || ''Czu allem fechten / gehört dy hölfe gotes von rechte ''
|-
|2. a healthy body and a good weapon || ''Gerader leip vnd gesvnder / eyn gancz vertik swert pesundr'' 
|-
|3. the principles of offensive and defensive and of [[hard and soft (martial arts)|hard and soft]]  ||  ''Vor noch swach sterke / yndes das wort mete czu merken''

|-
|8. training and confidence, speed, agility and good footwork || ''Vbunge vnd guter mut / motus gelenkheit schrete gut''
|}

A characteristic, introductory verse of Liechtenauer's – often repeated in later manuscripts – echoes classic 14th century [[chivalry]], addressing the student as "young [[knight]]" (''jung ritter''):

:(fol 18r) ''Jung Ritter lere / got lip haben frawen io ere / So wechst dein ere / Uebe ritterschaft und lere / kunst dy dich zyret und in krigen sere hofiret''
:"Young knight, learn to love God and revere noble ladies, so that your honour grows. Practice knighthood and learn the art that dignifies you, and brings you honour in wars."

==Unarmoured longsword==
[[File:MS 44 A 8 1v.jpg|thumb|''pflug'' and ''ochs'', as shown on fol. 1r of [[Cod. 44 A 8]] (1452)]]
[[File:MS 44 A 8 2r.jpg|thumb|fol. 2r, showing ''vom tag'' and ''alber'']]

The principal discipline is unarmoured fencing with the [[longsword]] (''Blossfechten'').

The foundation of the system comprises five "master-hews" (''Meisterhäue'') or "hidden hews" from which many masterful techniques arise, 12 "chief pieces" (''hauptstücke'') that categorize the main components of the art, and five words (''fünf Wörter'') dealing with concepts of timing and leverage.

At the center of the art is an emphasis on swiftness, as well as on balance and good judgement:

: (fol. 20r) ''vor noch swach stark Indes / an den selben woertern leit alle kunst / meister lichtnawers / Und sint dy gruntfeste und der / kern alles fechtens czu fusse ader czu rosse / blos ader in harnuesche''

:"'Before', 'after', 'weak', 'strong', ''Indes'' ('meanwhile'), on these five words hinges the entire art of master Lichtenauer, and they are the foundation and the core of all combat, on foot or on horseback, unarmoured or armoured."

The terms "before" (''vor'') and "after" (''nach'') correspond to offensive and defensive actions. While in the ''vor'', one dictates his opponent's actions and thus is in control of the engagement, while in the ''nach'', one responds to the decisions made by his opponent. Under Liechtenauer's system, a combatant must always strive to be in control of the engagement—that is, in the ''vor''. "Strong" (''stark'') and "weak" (''swach'') relate to the amount of force that is applied in a bind, or contact, of the swords. Here, neither is better than the other, but one needs to counter the opponent's action with a complementary reaction; strength is countered with weakness, and weakness with strength. ''Indes'' means "meanwhile" or "interim", referring to the time it takes for the opponent to complete an action. At the instant of contact with the opponent's blade, an experienced fencer uses "feeling" (''fühlen'') to immediately sense his opponent's pressure in order to know whether he should be "weak" or "strong" against him. He then either attacks on the ''vor'' or remains in the bind until his opponent acts, depending on what he feels is right. When his opponent starts to act, the fencer acts ''indes'' (meanwhile) and regains the ''vor'' before the opponent can finish his action.&lt;ref name=glossary&gt;[http://www.higginssword.org/guild/study/glossary/fechtkunst_glossary.pdf Abnemen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408213741/http://www.higginssword.org/guild/study/glossary/fechtkunst_glossary.pdf |date=8 April 2008 }}.

What follows is a list of technical terms of the system ''(with rough translation; they should each be explained in a separate section)'':

===Range===
Some of the later practitioners of the German school of fencing, such as Theodori Verolini,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholaes Detter (1887) [http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2009/6874/pdf/Petter-RingKunst-1887.pdf Ring Kunst]. Geidelberg. uni-giessen.de&lt;/ref&gt; started to use the term ''Mensur'' in the 17th century to explain the different ranges of the art of fencing.

*''Weite Mensur'' (wide mensur) the attacker has to make two footsteps to reach his opponent with his weapon.
*''Mittlere Mensur'' (middle mensur) the attacker has to make one footstep to reach the other combatant with the blade.
*''Nahe Mensur'' (near mensur) the attacker can cut or thrust his enemy without having to make any footsteps.
*''Enge Mensur'' (close mensur) the attacker and his opponent are so close that they are able to reach the other person with their hands. Most of the wrestling-techniques (Ringen am Schwert) can only be used in the close mensur.

===Basic attacks===
Liechtenauer and other German masters describe three basic methods of attack with the sword. They are sometimes called ''drei wunder'', "three wounders", with a deliberate pun on "three wonders."

*''Hauen'', "hews": A hewing stroke with one of the edges of the sword.
**''Oberhau'', "over hew": A stroke delivered from above the attacker.
**''Mittelhau'', "middle hew": A stroke delivered from side to side.
**''Unterhau'', "under hew": A stroke delivered from below the attacker.
*''Stechen'', "stabbing": A thrusting attack made with the point of the sword.
*''Abschneiden'', "slicing off": Slicing attacks made with the edge of the sword by placing the edge against the body of the opponent and then pushing or pulling the blade along it.

===Master-Hews (Meisterhäue)===
Called "five hews" in 3227a, later "hidden hews," and in late manuals "master hews", these likely originated as secret surprise attacks in Liechtenauer's system, but with the success of Liechtenauer's school, they may have become common knowledge. All five are attacks from the first phase of the fight (''zufechten'') and are long range, accompanied by triangular stepping.

* ''Zornhau'': "wrath-hew"
:A powerful diagonal hewing stroke dealt from the ''vom Tag'' guard that ends in the Wechsel guard on the opposite side.&lt;ref&gt;A Zornhau may be thrown from another guard, such as Ochs, but in doing so the person will move through the vom Tag guard.&lt;/ref&gt; When a Zornhau is used to displace (''Versetzen'') another oberhau, the impact and binding of the blades will result in the hew ending in a lower hanging at the center of the body.&lt;ref name=Mastercuts&gt;[http://www.thearma.org/essays/mastercuts.html The Mastercuts – What They Are and What They Aren’t] by Bartholomew Walczak and Jacob Norwood.&lt;/ref&gt; This strike is normally thrown to the opponent's upper opening.
* ''Krumphau'': "crooked-hew"
:A vertical hew from above that reaches across the direct line to the opponent, traveling left from a right position and vice versa. The motion of the blade resembles a windshield wiper. Krumphau is almost always accompanied with a wide diagonal sideways step. The Krumphau breaks the guard Ochs.
* ''Zwerchhau'', or ''Twerhau'': "thwart-hew"
:A high horizontal hew, with the short (backhand) edge when thrown from the right side and with the long edge when thrown from the left side. The Zwerchau breaks the guard vom Tag.
* ''Schielhau'': "squinting-hew"
:A short edge (backhand) hew dealt from the ''vom Tag'' guard that ends in an upper hanger on the opposite side and usually targets the head or the right shoulder.&lt;ref name=Mastercuts/&gt; It is basically a twist from ''vom Tag'' to opposite side ''Ochs'' with one step forward, striking simultaneously ''downwards'' with the short edge. The Schielhau breaks both the Pflug and Langen Ort guards and can be used to counter-hew against a powerful Oberhau.
* ''Scheitelhau'': "part-hew"
:A vertical descending hew that ends in the guard Alber. This hew is dealt to the opponent's upper openings, most often to the opponent's head, where the hair parts (hence the name of the hew). Through the principle of überlauffen, "overrunning" or "overreaching", a Scheitelhau is used to break the guard Alber.&lt;ref name=Mastercuts/&gt;

===Guards (also known as huten or leger)===
'''Basic Guards'''
*''vom Tach'': "from the Roof"
:a basic position with the sword held either on the right shoulder or above the head. The blade can be held vertically or at roughly 45-degrees.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;John Clements . [http://www.thearma.org/essays/StancesIntro.htm The Basic Guards of Medieval Longsword]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''tach'', or ''dach'', is often translated as "roof".{{clarify|date=July 2017|reason="dach" is the, at least modern German, spelling for "roof"}}
*''Ochs'': "ox"
:a position with the sword held to either side of the head, with the point (as a horn) aiming at the opponent's face.
*''Pflug'': "plough"
:a position with the sword held to either side of the body with the pommel near the back hip, with the point aiming at the opponent's chest or face. Some historical manuals state that when this guard is held on the right side of the body that the short edge should be facing up and when held on the left side of the body the short edge should be facing down with the thumb on the flat of the blade.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;
*''Alber'': "fool"
:In the Fool's Guard, the point of the sword is lowered to the ground, appearing to "foolishly" expose the upper parts of the body and inviting an attack. Although the Fool's Guard exposes the upper openings, it does provide excellent protection to the lower openings. From the Fool's Guard an attack or displacement can be made with the false edge of the sword, or the hilt of the sword can be quickly raised into a hanging parry.

'''Additional Guards''': Liechtenauer is emphatic that the above four guards are sufficient, and all guards taught by other masters may be derived from them. Later masters introduce richer terminology for variant guards:

*''Zornhut'': "wrath guard"
*''Wechsel'': "change"
*''Nebenhut'': "near guard" or "side guard"
*''Eisenport'': "iron door", mentioned in [[3227a]] as a non-Liechtenauerian ward, identical to the ''porta di ferro'' of the Italian school
*''Schlüssel'': "key"
*''Einhorn'': "unicorn", a variant of Ochs
*''Schrankhut'': "barrier guard"

The following are transitional stances that are not properly called guards:
*''Hengetort'': "hanging point"
*''Kron'': "crown", the sword hilt is held out about head height with the point up. Kron is used at the bind and is usually a prelude to grappling.
*''[[Langort]]'': "long point", the sword point is extended straight out at the opponent. Many of the cuts pass through this transitional guard, and it is the natural ending of a thrust.

===Techniques===
Other terms in Liechtenauer's system (most of them referring to positions or actions applicable in mid-combat, when the blades are in contact) include:

*''Duplieren'': "doubling", the immediate redoubling of a displaced hew.
*''Mutieren'': "mutating", change of attack method, changing a displaced hew into a thrust, or a displaced thrust into a hew.
*''Versetzen'': "[[displacement (fencing)|displacement]]" or "parrying"&lt;ref name =glossary/&gt; (upper/lower, left/right), to parry an attack with one's own weapon.
*''Nachreisen'': "after-traveling", the act of attacking an opponent after he has pulled back to attack, or an attack after the opponent has missed, or an attack following the opponent's action.&lt;ref name =glossary/&gt;
*''Überlaufen'': "over-running" or "overrunning", the act of countering a hew or thrust made from below with an attack from above; a slight step backward usually accompanies the attack, the higher blow out-ranging the lower one.
*''Absetzen'': "off-setting", deflecting a thrust or hew at the same time as stabbing.
*''Durchwechseln'': "changing-through", name for various techniques of escaping a bind by sliding the sword's point out from underneath the blade and then stabbing to another opening.
*''Zucken'': "tugging", a technique used in a strong bind between blades in which a combatant goes weak in the bind so as to disengage his blade from the bind and stabs or hews to the other side of the other combatant's blade. This technique is based upon the concept of using weakness against strength.
*''Durchlauffen'': "running-through", a technique by which one combatant "runs through" his opponent's attack to initiate [[grappling]] with him.
*''Händedrücken'': "pressing of hands", the execution of an ''Unterschnitt'' ("undercut") followed by an ''Oberschnitt'' ("overcut") such that the wrists of the opponent are sliced all the way around.
*''Hängen'': "hanging" (upper/lower, left/right)
*''Winden'': "Winding", the combatant moves the strong side of his blade to the weak side of the opponent's blade to gain leverage while keeping his point online with the opponent's opening. There are eight variations.

==Armoured combat (Harnischfechten)==
{{anchor|Harnischfechten}}
[[File:Augsburg Cod.I.6.4º.2 (Codex Wallerstein) 107v.jpg|200px|thumb|''Halbschwert'' against ''Mordstreich'' in the [[Codex Wallerstein]] (Plate 214)]]
Combat in full [[plate armour]] made use of the same weapons as ''Blossfechten'', the longsword and dagger (possibly of special make optimized for piercing the openings in armour); but the techniques were entirely different. Attacking an opponent in plate armour is carried out in two ways: percussive force or penetration at joints or unprotected areas. Penetration was extremely unlikely even with thrusting attacks. Percussion was realized with the ''[[Mordhau (weaponry)|Mordstreich]]'' ("murder strike"), an attack with the hilt when holding the sword at the blade, and then penetration into openings of the armour with the ''[[Halbschwert]]'' (short sword), which allowed stabbing with greater precision. From the evidence of the [[Fechtbuch|Fechtbücher]], most armoured fights were concluded by wrestling moves, with one combatant falling to the ground. Lying on the ground, he could then be easily killed with a stab into his visor or another opening of the armour.

'''Hadacol''' was a [[patent medicine]] marketed as a [[vitamin]] supplement. Its principal attraction, however, was that it contained 12 percent [[alcohol]] (listed on the tonic bottle's label as a "preservative"), which made it quite popular in the [[dry counties]] of the southern United States. It was the product of four-term [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana State Senator]] [[Dudley J. LeBlanc]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Erath, Louisiana|Erath]] in [[Vermilion Parish]] in southwestern [[Louisiana]]. He was not a [[medical doctor]], nor a registered [[pharmacist]], but had a strong talent for self-promotion. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine once described him as "a stem-winding salesman who knows every razzle-dazzle switch in the pitchman's trade".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888933,00.html|title=Medicine: The Mixture As Before|date=1951-01-22|work=Time|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In 1943, LeBlanc conceived the idea that became "Hadacol" in [[New Orleans]], when he had persistent pain in his foot and elsewhere. He asked a doctor to give him medication for pain: then he found that what the doctor gave him was a B-vitamin elixir, which he proposed to duplicate with a few changes and sell to a mass consumer market. (Years later, reports arose saying that LeBlanc had offered the doctor a share of the business, but the medical man refused. On a return visit, LeBlanc allegedly took a bottle with a few drops remaining of the medicine when the nurse had left the room.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Hosted at Quackwatch |url=http://www.quackwatch.com/13Hx/MM/15.html |title=Medicine show impresario |last=Young | first=James Harvey}} An excerpt from Young's printed book: {{Citation|title=The Medical Messiahs: A social history of health quackery in twentieth-century America|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-691-00579-6|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/13Hx/MM/00.html|author=James Harvey Young.}}&lt;/ref&gt; LeBlanc said that his research showed that [[multivitamin]]s taken collectively would yield greater results than a single vitamin for a specific problem.

==Dosage==
The label on the tonic's bottle clearly stated that the recommended dosage (1 tablespoonful taken 4 times a day) was to be taken "...in a 1/2 glass of water after meals and before retiring". However, some [[pharmacies]] in dry counties were known to sell it by the shot-glass and at least one bar in New Orleans' [[French Quarter]] was known to sell a "Tassel Cocktail" with Hadacol as an ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cocktaildb.com/ingr_detail?id=86|title=CocktailDB: The Internet Cocktail Database {{!}} Hadacol|website=www.cocktaildb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Northbrook, Illinois, a suburb of [[Chicago]], sales of Hadacol were limited to liquor stores.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', March 28, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion==

LeBlanc created the name "Hadacol" from his former business, the Happy Day Company, maker of Happy Day Headache Powders (which the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]], or FDA, had seized) and Dixie Dew Cough Syrup. "Happy" became "HA", "Days" became "DA," "Company" became "CO", and his own last name "LeBlanc" provided the "L". Hence the created name was "Hadacol."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=18 February 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|newspaper=Newsweek|volume=37 |pages=33|date=16 April 1951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when LeBlanc was asked about the name, he would often joke, "Well, I hadda' call it something!"

A two-page advertisement for Hadacol appeared in the centerfold of the 1951 edition of ''Grier's Almanac,'' an annual publication marketed to farmers in the Southern USA. The ad's headline read (in very large type):
*''Don't Be Satisfied With Symptomatic Relief! It's Possible to RELIEVE THE CAUSE OF YOUR AILMENTS When Lack Of Vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Iron and Niacin Cause Stomach Disturbances, Gas, Heartburn, Indigestion, Nagging Aches and Pains, and Certain Nervous Disorders.''

The ad continued with testimonials and a glowing plug for Senator LeBlanc, stressing the curative powers of Hadacol for a number of ailments "...due to lack of Vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Iron and Niacin". A capsule version of Hadacol was briefly produced, consisting solely of a B-Vitamin and mineral mixture.

LeBlanc promoted the tonic as a "Dietary Supplement" instead of a medicine, stating that it was "...formulated as an Aid to Nature in rebuilding the Pep, Strength and Energy of Buoyant Health when the System is deficient in the Vitamins and Minerals found in this Tonic..." But ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]] Magazine'' described it as "a murky brown liquid that tastes something like bilge water, and smells worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,858854,00.html|title=Medicine: Dietary Supplement|date=1950-06-19|work=Time|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Medical Association]] was likewise not as appreciative. In an official press release in 1951, the AMA stated, "It is hoped that no doctor will be uncritical enough to join in the promotion of Hadacol. It is difficult to imagine how one could do himself or his profession greater harm from the standpoint of the abuse of the trust of a patient suffering from any condition. Hadacol is not a specific medication. It is not even a specific preventive measure."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888933,00.html|title=Medicine: The Mixture As Before|date=1951-01-22|work=Time|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LeBlanc flooded the airwaves with testimonials to the powers of the seemingly miraculous (yet foul tasting) brown liquid and turned the jingle called "Hadacol Boogie" into a popular recording. Promotional items included various fliers, signs and clocks, a "Captain Hadacol" [[comic book]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.savagecritic.com/jog/my-life-is-choked-with-comics-20-ver-2-0-captain-hadacol|title=My Life is Choked with Comics #20 (Ver. 2.0): Captain Hadacol}}&lt;/ref&gt; T-shirts, lipstick, an [[almanac]], plastic [[thimble]]s printed with the Hadacol [[logo]], water pistols and cowboy-style holsters, glasses used for taking the diluted mixture, and a stamped metal token redeemable for 25¢ towards the purchase of any bottle of Hadacol (LeBlanc brazenly placed his own portrait on the front of the token, and the trademarked logo on the back).&lt;ref&gt;''The Cajuns: Americanization of a People'' -  Shane K. Bernard (pg35)&lt;/ref&gt;  These items, along with the Hadacol bottles and the boxes they were packaged in, are now much sought-after items, and fetch high prices among collectors of Southern memorabilia and medical quackery.

In 1950, LeBlanc offered a handsome financial incentive to anyone who could provide him with a parrot that was trained to say "Polly wants Hadacol!" The parrot was to be exhibited at promotions. The offer included the following:
* ''The owner of such a bird, if selected, will be given a reasonable compensation on a contract basis. The owner and the parrot will travel in a limousine with the parrot's name engraved in gold on the door and will stay only at the best hotels. The parrot will be furnished a gold cage and its life insured. The parrot will visit large drugstores, perform at conventions, etc., and may be presented on radio and television. The Le Blanc Corporation has a triple A high credit rating.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,935478,00.html|title=MANNERS &amp; MORALS: The Pampered Parrot|date=1950-10-09|work=Time|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hadacol Caravan==
LeBlanc was an entrepreneur in other areas too, but it is Hadacol that made him famous outside Louisiana. For his "Hadacol Goodwill Caravan" touring shows (the last of the big-time "[[medicine show]]s"), LeBlanc brought in [[Hollywood]] celebrities, including such luminaries as [[Roy Acuff]],&lt;ref&gt;''Minden Herald'', August 18, 1950, announces an appearance of the caravan in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] on August 31 of that year.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Berle]], [[Lucille Ball]], [[Minnie Pearl]], [[Connee Boswell]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Cesar Romero]], [[Dorothy Lamour]], [[Carmen Miranda]], [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Jack Dempsey]], [[Chico Marx]], [[Hank Williams]] and [[James Cagney]] to help him market the product. He also sponsored a separate touring show featuring notable [[Jazz]] and [[Blues]] musicians to attract black customers. Admission to the Hadacol gala was two Hadacol boxtops for adults, one for children. Considering that the 8 ounce bottle cost $1.25 and the "family size" 24 ounce bottle cost $3.50 each during the late 1940s, this was not cheap (Adjusted for inflation, the prices would be around $10 and $30 in 2007). Sales of the tonic at the shows were brisk.

According to musician [[Bill Lister|Weldon "Big Bill" Lister]], who performed in the Hadacol Caravan, "The only way you could get into that show was with a Hadacol boxtop, And believe me, we played to crowds of ten, twelve thousand people a night. Back in those days there wasn't many auditoriums that would hold that many people. We played ball parks, race tracks - you know anywhere where they had enough big bleachers to handle those kind of crowds." The final show was on 17 September 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bigbilllister.com/history.htm|title=HugeDomains.com - BigBillLister.com is for sale (Big Bill Lister)|website=www.bigbilllister.com|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Schrader]] wrote a script entitled ''Eight Scenes from the Life of Hank Williams'', which has not yet been produced. It includes a sequence on his performances with the Hadacol Caravan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weeklyscript.com/Eight%20Scenes%20From%20The%20Life%20Of%20Hank%20Williams%20(Unproduced).txt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downfall==
In a 15-month period ending in March 1951, LeBlanc sold more than $3,600,000 worth of the tonic. In another six months, after LeBlanc sold his interest of the LeBlanc Corporation (Hadacol's parent company) to investors for $8,200,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,935038,00.html|title=POLITICAL NOTES: $250,000 on the Bed|date=1951-10-01|work=Time|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,815378,00.html|title=PATENT MEDICINES: The Money Cure|date=1951-09-10|work=Time|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the enterprise collapsed under the weight of debtors. It was discovered all too late that LeBlanc was spending more for [[advertising]] by that point than he was taking in as receipts (turning its $3,600,000 profit into a $1,800,000 second-quarter loss), had concealed both $2,000,000 in unpaid bills and a $656,151 tax debt, and another $2,000,000, listed in the ledgers as "Accounts Receivable", were cases of the tonic out on [[consignment]], much of which was being shipped back. In an official court statement, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] stated that the publicity behind the tonic was "false, misleading and deceptive" in representing the [[patent medicine|nostrum]] as "an effective treatment and cure for scores of ailments and diseases."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,815564,00.html|title=HIGH FINANCE: Hadacol Hangover|date=1951-10-15|work=Time|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing bad publicity played a contributing factor to LeBlanc losing a [[gubernatorial]] election in 1952 and effectively halting his future statewide electoral chances.

[[Martin Gardner]]'s ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science|In the Name of Science]]'' (1952) mentions an interview that LeBlanc gave on [[Groucho Marx]]'s radio program: When Groucho asked him what Hadacol was good for, LeBlanc gave an answer of startling honesty. "It was good," the senator said, "for five million dollars for me last year." In 1954, after the Hadacol fiasco, LeBlanc tried to re-enter the patent medicine market with a lemon flavored non-alcoholic vitamin tonic named "Kary-On".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,823536,00.html|title=Business: TIME CLOCK, Aug. 23, 1954|date=1954-08-23|work=Time|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Hadacol, it quickly vanished from production.

According to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]], there were two attempts to revive Hadacol.  The first was in 1987 by Edmondson Enterprises of Shreveport, Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4007:t1qh88.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; The second attempt was in 1997 by Au Pharmaceuticals of Tyler, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4007:t1qh88.2.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Both attempts to revive the brand were unsuccessful. In 1976, "Hadacol" Multi-vitamins were distributed by the [[Atlanta, Georgia]] based "Hadacol Corporation" in an unsuccessful attempt to revive the brand name.

==In popular culture==
* Hadacol was the subject of several [[Country music|Country]], [[R&amp;B]], and [[Cajun]] tunes of its time:
** "Drinkin' Hadacol" by "Little Willie" Littlefield
** "Everybody Loves That Hadacol" by [[Tiny Hill]] and His Orchestra
** "H-A-D-A-C-O-L" by Al Terry (Allison Theriot)
** "Hadacol (That's All)" by the [[Treniers]]
** "Hadacol Boogie," covered by a number of musical acts, notably [[Bill Nettles and His Dixie Blue Boys]] and, more recently, the 2006 collaboration of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Buddy Guy]] (whose version on Lewis' [[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]] album ends with an [[Outro (music)|outro]] alluding to LeBlanc's "Hadda call it somethin'" joke)
** "Hadacol Bounce", written and recorded by Bill Nettles and performed also by [[Professor Longhair]]
** "Hadacol Corners" by [[Slim Willet]] ([[B-side|backed with]] the soon-to-be classic "Don't Let the Stars Get In Your Eyes")
** "Valse de Hadacol" (Hadacol Waltz) by Cajun musician/composer Harry Choates
* In the late 1990s, the American roots-rock band Big Iron, to avoid confusion with another band with the same name, changed the band's name to "Hadacol".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/hadacol|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|website=Answers.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of their 1999 debut CD, ''Better Than This'', is based on the label used on the tonic bottles.
* In 1948, Blues pianist Elmore "Elmo" Nixon made his debut as a "front man" when he recorded two songs under the name "Elmore Nix and the Hadacol Boys".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lilmikesf.blogspot.com/2005/04/were-gonna-roll-post-war-rb-era.html|title=Lil Mike's Last Known Thoughts &amp; Random Revelations...: We're Gonna Roll [ the post war R&amp;B era]|last=M|first=Lil|date=2005-04-09|website=Lil Mike's Last Known Thoughts &amp; Random Revelations...|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~jaymar41/SIW.html|title=Untitled Document|website=home.earthlink.net|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the 1953 [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon ''[[Muscle Tussle]]'', [[Daffy Duck]] buys a bogus muscle-building tonic called "Atomcol" from a traveling salesman.
* In 2005, [[Brent Green (animator)|Brent Green]] created an animated short entitled ''Hadacol Christmas''. The animator describes the threadbare 12 minute film this way: "Santa Claus invents Christmas with a belly full of cough syrup and a head full of dying crows."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Green|first=Brent|title=Hadacol Christmas|date=2006-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493422/|accessdate=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Green posted the film on [[YouTube]] in two parts ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRefdcvqDfw Part 1] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dcQtpSThEc Part 2]).
* "Hadacol Corner" was the originally proposed name for the town of [[Midkiff, Texas|Midkiff]] in Upton County, Texas, but the U.S. Postal Service objected (presumably because it disapproved of a registered brand name's being used as the name of a town).&lt;ref&gt;http://www4.drillinginfo.com/tiles/community/main.do?selected=wanderings16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hnm40|title=MIDKIFF, TX|last=CAUBLE|first=SMITH, JULIA|date=2010-06-15|website=www.tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1957 film ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' includes a sequence where the main character is promoting a patent medicine pill named "Vitajex", produced by a company owned by "General Hainsworth". These draw close parallels to Hadacol and Senator Dudley J. LeBlanc.

A '''hierarchy''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''hierarkhia'', "rule of a high priest", from ''[[ordinary (officer)|hierarkhes]]'', "president of sacred rites") is an arrangement of items (objects, names, values, categories, etc.) in which the items are represented as being "above", "below", or "at the same level as" one another. Hierarchy is an important concept in a wide variety of fields, such as [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[organizational theory]], [[systems theory]], and the [[social sciences]] (especially [[political philosophy]]).

A hierarchy can link entities either directly or indirectly, and either vertically or diagonally. The only direct links in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's immediate superior or to one of one's subordinates, although a system that is largely hierarchical can also incorporate alternative hierarchies. Indirect hierarchical links can extend "vertically" upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction, following a [[path (graph theory)|path]]. All parts of the hierarchy which are not linked vertically to one another nevertheless can be "horizontally" linked through a path by traveling up the hierarchy to find a common direct or indirect superior, and then down again. This is akin to two [[co-worker]]s or [[colleague]]s; each reports to a common superior, but they have the same relative amount of authority. Organizational forms exist that are both alternative and complementary to hierarchy. [[Heterarchy]] is one such form.

==Nomenclature==
{{see also| Glossary of graph theory| Taxonomy (general)| Structure}}
Hierarchies have their own special vocabulary. These terms are easiest to understand when a hierarchy is diagrammed (see [[#Visualization|below]]).

In an organizational context, the following terms are often used related to hierarchies:&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Architecture"/&gt;
* '''[[Entity|Object]]''': one entity (e.g., a person, department or [[concept]] or element of arrangement or member of a set)
* '''[[System]]''': the entire set of objects that are being arranged hierarchically (e.g., an administration)
* '''[[Dimension]]''': another word for "system" from on-line analytical processing (e.g. cubes)
* '''[[Element (mathematics)|Member]]''': an (element or object) at any (level or rank) in a (class-system, taxonomy or dimension)
*'''Terms about Positioning'''
**'''[[Ranking|Rank]]''': the relative [[value (ethics)|value]], worth, [[complexity]], [[Power (philosophy)|power]], [[importance]], [[authority]], level etc. of an object
**'''[[wikt:level#Noun|Level]]''': a set of objects with the same rank OR importance
**'''[[Order of precedence|Ordering]]''': the arrangement of the (ranks or levels)
**'''Hierarchy''': the arrangement of a particular set of members into (ranks or levels). Multiple hierarchies are possible per (dimension taxonomy or Classification-system), in which selected levels of the dimension are omitted to flatten the structure
*'''Terms about Placement'''
**'''[[wikt:hierarch|Hierarch]]''', the apex of the hierarchy, consisting of one single orphan (object or member) in the top level of a dimension. The root of an inverted-tree structure
**'''[[wikt:member|Member]]''', a (member or node) in any level of a hierarchy in a dimension to which (superior and subordinate) members are attached 
**'''[[wikt:orphan|Orphan]]''', a member in any level of a dimension without a parent member. Often the apex of a disconnected branch. Orphans can be grafted back into the hierarchy by creating a relationship (interaction) with a parent in the immediately superior level
**'''[[wikt:leaf|Leaf]]''', a member in any level of a dimension without subordinates in the hierarchy
**'''[[wikt:neighbour|Neighbour]]''': a member adjacent to another member in the same (level or rank). Always a peer.
**'''[[Superior (hierarchy)|Superior]]''': a higher level or an object ranked at a higher level (A parent or an ancestor)
**'''[[wikt:subordinate|Subordinate]]''': a lower level or an object ranked at a lower level (A child or a descendent)
** '''[[Family of sets|Collection]]''': all of the objects at one level (i.e Peers)
** '''[[wikt:peer|Peer]]''': an object with the same rank (and therefore at the same level)
** '''[[Interpersonal relationship|Interaction]]''': the relationship between an object and its direct superior or subordinate (i.e. a superior/inferior pair)
*** a '''direct''' interaction occurs when one object is on a level exactly one higher or one lower than the other (i.e., on a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]], the two objects have a line between them)
** '''[[Distance (graph theory)|Distance]]''': the minimum number of connections between two objects, i.e., one less than the number of objects that need to be "crossed" to trace a [[path (graph theory)|path]] from one object to another
** '''[[wikt:Span|Span]]''': a [[qualitative data|qualitative]] description of the width of a level when diagrammed, i.e., the number of subordinates an object has
*'''Terms about Nature'''
** '''[[wikt:attribute|Attribute]]''': a heritable characteristic of (members and their subordinates) in a level (eg. ''hair-colour'')
** '''[[wikt:attribute-value|Attribute-value]]''': the specific value of a heritable characteristic (eg. ''Auburn'')

In a mathematical context (in [[graph theory]]), the [[Glossary of graph theory|general terminology]] used is different.

Most hierarchies use a more specific vocabulary pertaining to their subject, but the idea behind them is the same. For example, with [[data structure]]s, objects are known as [[node (computer science)|nodes]], superiors are called [[parent node|parents]] and subordinates are called [[child node|children]]. In a business setting, a superior is a [[supervisor|supervisor/boss]] and a peer is a [[colleague]].

===Degree of branching===
[[Degree (graph theory)|Degree]] of [[Bifurcation theory|branching]] refers to the number of direct [[#Terminology|subordinates]] or children an object has (in graph theory, equivalent to the number of other [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] connected to via outgoing arcs, in a directed graph) a node has. Hierarchies can be categorized based on the "maximum degree", the highest degree present in the system as a whole. Categorization in this way yields two broad classes: ''linear'' and ''branching''.

In a '''linear hierarchy'''&lt;!--per WP:R#PLA, this SHOULD be bold--&gt;, the maximum degree is 1.&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt; In other words, all of the objects can be visualized in a line-up, and each object (excluding the top and bottom ones) has exactly one direct subordinate and one direct superior. Note that this is referring to the ''objects'' and not the ''levels''; every hierarchy has this property with respect to levels, but normally each level can have an infinite number of objects. An example of a linear hierarchy is the [[hierarchy of life]].

In a '''branching hierarchy'''&lt;!--per WP:R#PLA, this SHOULD be bold--&gt;, one or more objects has a degree of 2 or more (and therefore the minimum degree is 2 or higher).&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt; For many people, the word "hierarchy" automatically evokes an image of a branching hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt; Branching hierarchies are present within numerous systems, including [[organization]]s and [[classification scheme]]s. The broad category of branching hierarchies can be further subdivided based on the degree.

A '''flat hierarchy'''&lt;!--per WP:R#PLA, this SHOULD be bold--&gt; is a branching hierarchy in which the maximum degree approaches infinity, i.e., that has a wide span.&lt;ref name="Architecture"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=Herbert A.|title=The Architecture of Complexity|journal=[[Proc. Am. Philos. Soc.]]|volume=106|issue=6|date=12 December 1962|pages=467–482|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|issn=0003-049X|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |jstor=985254 |citeseerx=10.1.1.110.961}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, systems intuitively regarded as hierarchical have at most a moderate span. Therefore, a flat hierarchy is often not viewed as a hierarchy at all. For example, [[diamond]]s and [[graphite]] are flat hierarchies of numerous [[carbon]] atoms which can be further decomposed into subatomic particles.

An '''overlapping hierarchy'''&lt;!--per WP:R#PLA, this SHOULD be bold--&gt; is a branching hierarchy in which at least one object has two parent objects.&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt; For example, a [[graduate student]] can have two [[research supervisor|co-supervisors]] to whom the student reports directly and equally, and who have the same level of authority within the [[university]] hierarchy (i.e., they have the same [[list of academic ranks|position]] or [[tenure]] status).

==History of the term==
Possibly the first use of the English word "hierarchy" cited by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' was in 1880, when it was used in reference to the three orders of three angels as depicted by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (5th–6th centuries). Pseudo-Dionysius used the related [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word (ἱεραρχία ''hierarchia'') both in reference to the [[De Coelesti Hierarchia|celestial hierarchy]] and the [[ecclesiastical hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07322c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Hierarchy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek term ἱεραρχία means "rule of a high priest"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/hierarchy "hierarchy"]. [[Online Etymology Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; (from ἱεράρχης ''hierarches'', meaning "president of sacred rites, high-priest"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Di%28era%2Frxhs ἱεράρχης],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and that from ἱερεύς ''hiereus'', "priest"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Di%28ereu%2Fs ἱερεύς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and ἀρχή ''arche'', amongst others "first place or power, rule"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rxh%2F ἀρχή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;), and Dionysius is credited with first use of it as an abstract noun. Since hierarchical churches, such as the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] (see [[Catholic Church hierarchy]]) and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, had tables of organization that were "hierarchical" in the modern sense of the word (traditionally with [[God in Christianity|God]] as the pinnacle or head of the hierarchy), the term came to refer to similar organizational methods in [[secular]] settings.

[[File:Maslow's hierarchy of needs.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Maslow's hierarchy of human needs]]. This is an example of a hierarchy visualized with a triangle diagram.]]
A hierarchy is typically depicted as a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], where the height of a level represents that level's status and width of a level represents the quantity of items at that level relative to the whole. For example, the few [[Board of Directors|Directors]] of a company could be at the [[apex (geometry)|apex]], and the [[Base (geometry)|base]] could be thousands of people who have no subordinates.

These pyramids are typically diagrammed with a [[tree structure|tree]] or [[triangle]] [[diagram]] (but note that not all triangle/pyramid diagrams are hierarchical, for example, the 1992 [[History of USDA nutrition guides#Food Guide Pyramid|USDA food guide pyramid]]), both of which serve to emphasize the size differences between the levels. An example of a triangle diagram appears to the right. An [[organizational chart]] is the diagram of a hierarchy within an [[organization]], and is depicted in tree form [[#Organizations|below]].

More recently, as computers have allowed the storage and navigation of ever larger data sets, various methods have been developed to represent hierarchies in a manner that makes more efficient use of the available space on a computer's screen. Examples include fractal maps, [[treemapping|TreeMaps]] and [[Radial tree|Radial Trees]].

==Visual hierarchy==
In the design field, mainly graphic design, successful layouts and formatting of the content on documents are heavily dependent on the rules of [[visual hierarchy]]. Visual hierarchy is also important for proper organization of files on computers.

An example of visually representing hierarchy is through the Nested clusters. The Nested clusters represents hierarchical relationships by using layers of information. The child element is within the parent element, such as in a [[Venn diagram]]. This structure of representing hierarchy is most effective in representing simple relationships. For example, when directing someone to open a file on a computer desktop, one may first direct them towards the main folder, then the subfolders within the main folder. They will keep opening files within the folders until the designated file is located.

For more complicated hierarchies, the stair structure represents hierarchical relationships through the use of visual stacking. Visually imagine the top of a downward staircase beginning at the left and descending on the right. The child elements are towards the bottom of the stairs and the parent elements are at the top. This structure is effective when representing more complicated hierarchies where steps are not placed in obvious sequences. Further steps are concealed unless all of the steps are revealed in sequence. In the computer desktop example, a file that is being sought after can only be found once another file is opened. The link for the desired file is within another document. All the steps must be completed until the final destination is reached.

==Informal representation==
In plain English, a hierarchy can be thought of as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] in which:&lt;ref name="Dawkins"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Dawkins|title=Hierarchical organization: a candidate principle for ethology|conference=Growing points in ethology: based on a conference sponsored by St. John's College and King's College, Cambridge|editors=Bateson, Paul Patrick Gordon; Hinde, Robert A.|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-29086-4|pages=7–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# No element is superior to itself, and
# One element, the ''hierarch'', is superior to all of the other elements in the set.
The first requirement is also interpreted to mean that a hierarchy can have no [[Cycle (graph theory)|circular relationships]]; the association between two objects is always [[Transitive relation|transitive]].
The second requirement asserts that a hierarchy must have a leader or [[root node|root]] that is common to all of the objects.

==Mathematical representation==
{{Main|Hierarchy (mathematics)}}
Mathematically, in its most general form, a hierarchy is a [[partially ordered set]] or ''poset''.&lt;ref name="Lehmann"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Lehmann|first=Fritz|title=Big Posets of Participatings and Thematic Roles|pages=50–74|conference=Conceptual structures: knowledge representation as interlingua—4th International Conference on Conceptual Structures, ICCS '96, Sydney, Australia, August 19–22, 1996—proceedings
|isbn=3-540-61534-2|year=1996|publisher=Springer|editor-last=Eklund|editor-first=Peter G.|editor2-last=Ellis|editor2-first=Gerard|editor3-last=Mann|editor3-first=Graham|series=Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 115|location=Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[#Terminology|system]] in this case is the entire poset, which is constituted of elements. Within this system, each element shares a particular unambiguous property. Objects with the same property value are grouped together, and each of those resulting [[#Terminology|levels]] is referred to as a [[class (set theory)|class]].

"Hierarchy" is particularly used to refer to a poset in which the classes are organized in terms of increasing complexity. &lt;!--Mathematically, a hierarchy can be depicted as a [[combinatorial]] [[object]].--&gt;
Operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are often performed in a certain sequence or order. Usually, addition and subtraction are performed after multiplication and division has already been applied to a problem. The use of parenthesis is also a representation of hierarchy, for they show which operation is to be done prior to the following ones. For example:
(2 + 5) × (7 - 4).
In this problem, typically one would multiply 5 by 7 first, based on the rules of mathematical hierarchy. But when the parentheses are placed, one will know to do the operations within the parentheses first before continuing on with the problem. These rules are largely dominant in algebraic problems, ones that include several steps in order to solve. The use of hierarchy in mathematics is beneficial in order to quickly and efficiently solve a problem without having to go through the process of slowly dissecting the problem. Most of these rules are now known as the proper way into solving certain equations.

A nested hierarchy or ''inclusion hierarchy'' is a hierarchical ordering of [[nested set]]s.&lt;ref name="natsocsci-ch4"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Hierarchy, Complexity, Society|last=Lane|first=David|pages=81–120|encyclopedia=Hierarchy in Natural and Social Sciences|editor=Pumain, Denise|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|location=New York, New York|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4020-4126-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nesting is exemplified in Russian [[matryoshka doll]]s. Each doll is encompassed by another doll, all the way to the outer doll. The outer doll holds all of the inner dolls, the next outer doll holds all the remaining inner dolls, and so on. Matryoshkas represent a nested hierarchy where each level contains only one object, i.e., there is only one of each size of doll; a generalized nested hierarchy allows for multiple objects within levels but with each object having only one parent at each level. The general concept is both demonstrated and mathematically formulated in the following example:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{square} \subset \text{quadrilateral} \subset \text{polygon} \subset \text{shape} \, &lt;/math&gt;

A square can always also be referred to as a quadrilateral, polygon or shape. In this way, it is a hierarchy. However, consider the set of polygons using this classification. A square can ''only'' be a quadrilateral; it can never be a [[triangle]], [[hexagon]], etc.

Nested hierarchies are the organizational schemes behind [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] and systematic classifications. For example, using the original [[Linnaean taxonomy]] (the version he laid out in the 10th edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]''), a human can be formulated as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae :secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis|last=Linnaei|first=Carl von|authorlink=Carl Linnaeus|year=1959|edition=10th|language=Latin|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/542#|location=[[Stockholm]]|publisher=Impensis Direct|isbn=0-665-53008-0|accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{H. sapiens} \subset \text{Homo} \subset \text{Primates} \subset \text{Mammalia} \subset \text{Animalia}&lt;/math&gt;

Taxonomies may change frequently (as seen in [[biological classification|biological taxonomy]]), but the underlying concept of nested hierarchies is always the same.

In many programming taxonomies and syntax models (as well as fractals in mathematics), nested hierarchies, including Russian dolls, are also used to illustrate the properties of [[self-similarity]] and [[recursion]]. Recursion itself is included as a subset of hierarchical programming, and recursive thinking can be synonymous with a form of hierarchical thinking and logic.&lt;ref name=Corballis&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Corballis |title=The Recursive Mind  |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0691145471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Containment hierarchy====
A containment hierarchy is a direct extrapolation of the [[#Nested hierarchy|nested hierarchy]] concept. All of the ordered sets are still nested, but every set must be "[[strict subset|strict]]"—no two sets can be identical. The shapes example above can be modified to demonstrate this:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{square} \subsetneq \text{quadrilateral} \subsetneq \text{polygon} \subsetneq \text{shape} \, &lt;/math&gt;

The notation &lt;math&gt; x \subsetneq y \, &lt;/math&gt; means ''x'' is a subset of ''y'' but is not equal to&amp;nbsp;''y''.

A general example of a containment hierarchy is demonstrated in [[inheritance (computer science)|class inheritance]] in [[object-oriented programming]].

Two types of containment hierarchies are the ''subsumptive'' containment hierarchy and the ''compositional'' containment hierarchy. A subsumptive hierarchy "[[wikt:subsume|subsumes]]" its children, and a compositional hierarchy is "[[wikt:composed|composed]]" of its children. A hierarchy can also be both subsumptive ''and'' compositional{{example needed|date=August 2018}}.&lt;ref name="AI industrial"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Industrial and Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems|last=Kopisch|first=Manfred|last2=Günther|first2=Andreas|doi=10.1007/BFb0024994|editor-last=Belli|editor-first=Fevzi|encyclopedia=Industrial and engineering applications of artificial intelligence and expert systems: 5th international conference, IEA/AIE-92, Paderborn, Germany, June 9–12, 1992 : proceedings|year=1992|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|pages=424–427|isbn=3-540-55601-X|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science Series|volume=602|issn=0302-9743|editor6-last=Radermacher|editor8-first=Franz-Josef|chapter=Configuration of a passenger aircraft cabin based on conceptual hierarchy, constraints and flexible control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Subsumptive containment hierarchy=====
A ''[[Category theory|subsumptive]]'' containment hierarchy is a classification of object classes from the general to the specific. Other names for this type of hierarchy are "taxonomic hierarchy" and "[[is-a|IS-A]] hierarchy".&lt;ref name="Lehmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wtxdoc/v8r2m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.dtx.md.doc/concepts/c_map_design_Compositional_Hierarchy.htm|title=Compositional hierarchy|work=WebSphere Transformation Extender Design Studio|accessdate=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sys model"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=An advanced modeling environment based on a hybrid AI-OR approach|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ds2eIQ6XZy0C&amp;pg=PA366|pages=366–75|last=Funke|first=Birger|last2=Sebastian|first2=Hans-Jürgen|title=Systems modelling and optimization: proceedings of the 18th IFIP TC7 conference|volume=396|series=Research notes in mathematics series|editor1-last=Polis|editor1-first=Michael P.|editor2-last=Dontchev|editor2-first=Asen L.|editor3-last=Kall|editor3-first=Peter|editor4-last=Lascieka|editor4-first=Irena|editor5-last=Olbrot|editor5-first=Andrzej W.|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8493-0607-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last term describes the relationship between each level—a lower-level object "is a" member of the higher class. The taxonomical structure outlined above is a subsumptive containment hierarchy. Using again the example of Linnaean taxonomy, it can be seen that an object that is part of the level ''Mammalia'' "is a" member of the level ''Animalia''; more specifically, a human "is a" primate, a primate "is a" mammal, and so on. A subsumptive hierarchy can also be defined abstractly as a hierarchy of "[[concept]]s".&lt;ref name="sys model"/&gt; For example, with the Linnaean hierarchy outlined above, an entity name like ''Animalia'' is a way to group all the species that fit the [[wikt:conceptualization|conceptualization]] of an animal.

=====Compositional containment hierarchy=====
A ''compositional'' containment hierarchy is an ordering of the parts that make up a system—the system is "composed" of these parts.&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=David|title=Object Oriented Programming in C++|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2002|pages=110–185|isbn=0-8264-5428-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most engineered structures, whether natural or artificial, can be broken down in this manner.

The compositional hierarchy that every person encounters at every moment is the [[hierarchy of life]]. Every person can be reduced to [[organ system]]s, which are composed of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], which are composed of [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], which are composed of [[cells (biology)|cells]], which are composed of [[molecule]]s, which are composed of [[atom]]s. In fact, the last two levels apply to all [[matter]], at least at the [[macroscopic scale]]. Moreover, each of these levels inherit all the properties of their [[#Terminology|children]].

In this particular example, there are also ''[[emergent properties]]''—functions that are not seen at the lower level (e.g., [[cognition]] is not a property of [[neuron]]s but is of the [[Human brain|brain]])—and a scalar quality (molecules are bigger than atoms, cells are bigger than molecules, etc.). Both of these concepts commonly exist in compositional hierarchies, but they are not a required general property. These ''level hierarchies'' are characterized by bi-directional [[Causality|causation]].&lt;ref name="natsocsci-ch4"/&gt; ''Upward causation'' involves lower-level entities causing some property of a higher level entity; children entities may interact to yield parent entities, and parents are composed at least partly by their children. ''[[Downward causation]]'' refers to the effect that the incorporation of entity ''x'' into a higher-level entity can have on ''x'''s properties and interactions. Furthermore, the entities found at each level are ''[[autonomous]]''.

Almost every system of organization applied to the world is arranged hierarchically.&lt;ref name="electrodynamics"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hierarchical Methods: Hierarchy and hierarchical asymptotic methods in electrodynamics|last=Kulish|first=V.

Most [[organized religion]]s, regardless of their internal governance structures, operate as a hierarchy under [[God]]. Many [[Christian denomination]]s have an [[autocephalous]] [[ecclesiastical hierarchy]] of leadership. Families are viewed as a hierarchical structure in terms of [[cousinship]] (e.g., first cousin once removed, second cousin, etc.), [[ancestry]] (as depicted in a [[family tree]]) and [[inheritance]] ([[order of succession|succession]] and [[heir]]ship). All the requisites of a well-rounded life and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] can be organized using [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Maslow's hierarchy of human needs]]. [[Learning]] must often follow a hierarchical scheme—to learn [[differential equation]]s one must first learn [[calculus]]; to learn calculus one must first learn [[elementary algebra]]; and so on. Even [[nature]] itself has its own hierarchies, as numerous schemes such as [[Linnaean taxonomy]], the [[biological organisation|organization of life]], and [[biomass pyramid]]s attempt to document. Hierarchies are so infused into daily life that they are viewed as trivial.&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="electrodynamics"/&gt;

While the above examples are often clearly depicted in a hierarchical form and are classic examples, hierarchies exist in numerous systems where this branching structure is not immediately apparent. For example, most [[postal code]] systems are hierarchical. Using the [[Postal codes in Canada|Canadian postal code system]] as an example, the top level's binding concept is the "[[forward sortation area|postal district]]", and consists of 18 objects (letters). The next level down is the "zone", where the objects are the digits 0–9. This is an example of an [[#Degree_of_branching|overlapping hierarchy]], because each of these 10 objects has 18 parents. The hierarchy continues downward to generate, in theory, 7,200,000 unique codes of the format ''A0A 0A0'' (the second and third letter position allow 20 objects each). Most [[library classification]] systems are also hierarchical. The [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]] is regarded as infinitely hierarchical because there is no finite bound on the number of digits can be used after the decimal point.&lt;ref name="Dewey"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tracking Nuclear Sources|date=May–June 2009|last=Walker|first=Randy|publisher=wellservicingmagazine.com|pages=28–30|url=http://wellservicingmagazine.com/sites/default/files/pdfmag/WSM_MAYJUN09.PDF|format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} See also [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Wikipedia article]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Organizational chart.svg|thumb|200px|A simple [[hierarchical organization|organizational hierarchy]] depicted in the form of a [[tree structure|tree]]. Diagrams like this are called [[organizational chart]]s.]]

===Organizations===
{{Main|Organizational structure|Hierarchical organization}}

[[Organization]]s can be structured as a [[dominance hierarchy]]. In an organizational hierarchy, there is a single person or group with the most [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[authority]], and each subsequent level represents a lesser authority. Most organizations are structured in this manner, including [[Forms of government|governments]], [[Company|companies]], [[militia]] and [[organized religion]]s. The units or persons within an organization are depicted hierarchically in an [[organizational chart]].

In a [[reverse hierarchy]], the conceptual [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] of authority is turned upside-down, so that the apex is at the bottom and the base is at the top. This mode represents the idea that members of the higher rankings are responsible for the members of the lower rankings.

=== Life===
{{Main|Biological organisation#Fundamentals}}

Empirically,  we observe in nature a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems, they  exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity. [[Systems theory|System]] hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the empirical foundations for a [[Branches of science|field]] that would be, from the 1980s, '''hierarchical ecology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margalef|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wicken|Ulanowicz|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pumain|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|Jørgensen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical foundations are summarized by Thermodynamics.
When [[biological systems]] are modeled as [[physical system]]s, in its most general abstraction, they are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|thermodynamic open systems]] that exhibit [[self-organisation|self-organised]] behavior, and the [[Set theory|set/subset]] relations between [[dissipative structures]] can be characterized in a hierarchy.

===Computer graphic imaging===
{{Main|3D modeling}}
[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and [[computer animation]] [[computer program|programs]] mostly use hierarchies for models. On a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[3d modeling|model]] of a [[human]] for example, the [[chest]] is a [[parent]] of the upper left arm, which is a parent of the lower left arm, which is a parent of the [[hand]]. This is used in [[3D modeling|modeling]] and [[animation]] for almost everything built as a 3D [[Digital data|digital]] model.

===Linguistics===
Many grammatical theories, such as [[phrase-structure grammar]], involve hierarchy.

[[Direct–inverse language]]s such as [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[Mapudungun language|Mapudungun]] distinguish subject and object on [[verb]]s not by different subject and object markers, but via a hierarchy of persons.

In this system, the three (or four with [[Algonquian languages]]) persons are placed in a hierarchy of [[salience (language)|salience]]. To distinguish which is subject and which object, ''inverse markers'' are used if the object outranks the subject.

===Music===
The structure of a musical composition is often understood hierarchically (for example by [[Heinrich Schenker]] (1768–1835, see [[Schenkerian analysis]]), and in the (1985) [[Generative theory of tonal music|Generative Theory of Tonal Music]], by composer [[Fred Lerdahl]] and linguist Ray [[Jackendoff]]). The sum of all notes in a piece is understood to be an all-inclusive surface, which can be reduced to successively more sparse and more fundamental types of motion. The levels of structure that operate in Schenker's theory are the foreground, which is seen in all the details of the musical score; the middle ground, which is roughly a summary of an essential contrapuntal progression and voice-leading; and the background or [[Ursatz]], which is one of only a few basic "long-range counterpoint" structures that are shared in the gamut of tonal music literature.

The [[pitch (music)|pitches]] and [[Musical form|form]] of [[Tonality|tonal]] music are organized hierarchically, all pitches deriving their importance from their relationship to a [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] [[Key signature|key]], and secondary themes in other keys are brought back to the tonic in a recapitulation of the primary theme. [[Susan McClary]] connects this specifically in the [[sonata-allegro form]] to the feminist hierarchy of gender (see above) in her book ''Feminine Endings'', even pointing out that primary themes were often previously called "masculine" and secondary themes "feminine."

===Ethics, behavioral psychology, philosophies of identity===
[[File:Hierarchy Of Purposes.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Career-oriented purposes can be diagrammed using a hierarchy describing how less important actions support a larger goal.]]
In [[ethics]], various [[virtues]] are enumerated and sometimes organized hierarchically according to certain brands of [[virtue theory]].

In some of these random examples, there is an asymmetry of 'compositional' significance between levels of structure, so that small parts of the whole hierarchical array depend, for their meaning, on their membership in larger parts.There is a hierarchy of activities in human life: productive activity serves or is guided by the moral life; the moral life is guided by practical reason; practical reason (used in moral and political life) serves contemplative reason (whereby we contemplate God). Practical reason sets aside time and resources for contemplative reason.

In the work of diverse theorists such as [[William James]] (1842–1910), [[Michel Foucault]] (1926–1984) and [[Hayden White]], important critiques of hierarchical [[epistemology]] are advanced. James famously asserts in his work "Radical Empiricism" that clear distinctions of type and category are a constant but unwritten goal of scientific reasoning, so that when they are discovered, success is declared. But if aspects of the world are organized differently, involving inherent and intractable ambiguities, then scientific questions are often considered unresolved.

Hierarchy in ethics emerged in Western Europe, West Asia and North Africa around the 1600s. In this aspect, the term hierarchy refers to how distinguishable they are from real to unreal. [[Feminists]], [[Marxists]], [[anarchists]], [[communists]], [[critical theorists]] and others, all of whom have multiple interpretations, criticize the hierarchies commonly found within human society, especially in social relationships. Hierarchies are present in all parts of society: in businesses, schools, families, etc. These relationships are often viewed as necessary. Entities that stand in hierarchical arrangements are animals, humans, plants, etc. In some{{Which|date=July 2012}} cultures, God can also be an addition to this hierarchy. However, feminists, Marxists, critical theorists, and others analyze hierarchy in terms of the values and power that it arbitrarily assigns to one group over another. Hierarchical ethics offers a way of logical reasoning that is compatible with religious commitments. In some{{Which|date=July 2012}} cultures, there is hierarchy within humanity: The man in a family is above the woman, and children are after, and in social classes there might be a hierarchy as follows: king, civic officials, craftsmen, unskilled workers.

{{Politics of Egypt}}
'''Parliamentary life''' in Egypt has been a mark of Egyptian civilizations along its history. In modern history, parliamentary life started as early as 1824 while representative parliamentary life did not start until 1866. In 2016, Egypt celebrated the 150th anniversary of Parliamentary life in their country.&lt;ref name="150YearsStamp"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Postage Stamp to Mark 150th Anniversary of Parliamentary Life|url=http://www.mcit.gov.eg/Media_Center/Press_Room/Photo_Gallery/6289|website=Ministry of Communications &amp; Information Technology|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's [[Parliament of Egypt]] is [[unicameral]], made up of the [[House of Representatives (Egypt)|House of Representatives]].

== Pre-1923 history ==
Egypt is known for beginning the earliest administrative and legislative codes in history.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Throughout its history, formidable human cultures and civilizations offered the most advanced form of governance and management. 
The [[Pharaonic Egypt|Pharaonic]] civilization laid the groundwork of governance and management. The [[Pharaoh]], on top of the state hierarchy, appointed high-ranking government officials. A viable system of government has been in force ever since the third and fourth dynasties, several codes were unleashed; some were related to limited working hours of peasants while others combatted forced labor and lots of other tiring jobs...

After [[Alexander the Great]] had invaded Egypt in 330 B.C., the [[Hellenistic era]] began, mixing between the Egyptian and the Greek civilizations. After his death, the [[Ptolemy]] era began only to be overthrown by the Romans.

Although [[Roman Egypt|Roman rule]] was bitter, Egyptians had retained most of their respective traditions, rules, and norms until Christianity spread in the first half of the first century, with the church largely sharing in the sustainability of intrinsic habits and customs.

During the Islamic era, governance and legislation were principally drawn from the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]] based on the formula of consultation ''sûra'' being one of the fundamental principles of Islamic law.
When Cairo became the capital of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] (969–1171) governance and legislation had developed. Furthermore, the city of Cairo became the capital of Egypt and the Islamic Caliphate.

Throughout the era of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] (1171–1250), The [[Cairo Citadel]] became the headquarters and the center of power. Legislative and judicial councils diversified, and there was a justice council and another to attend to complaints lodged. Their duties involved laws as well as treaties with foreign countries

In the [[Mamelouk]] era (1250–1517), Sultan El-Zaher [[Baibars]] built the Court of Justice at Salah El-Deen El-Ayoubi citadel to be the government premises. Its competence covered enforcement of laws, settling of disputes, and negotiations with nearby countries.

During the Ottoman era (1517–1805), Islamic courts constituted the judicial system applied. Judges had their verdicts directly based on Islamic jurisprudence (Sharia) principles as far as civil and criminal disputes were concerned. This continued in effect until the end of the 18th Century. Thus, Egypt had been the scene of crucial political and social developments

In 1795, almost six years after the French revolution, a major political uprising demanding rights, freedoms and justice fueled. It brought together national forces and popular leaderships in support of national demands for justice, equality and freedom.

As a result of the mounting resistance against the Ottoman ruler, the Wali and (Mamloukes), Egypt had been on the verge of a massive revolt. This led to the Ulama laying their hands on a written document which outlined the individual - ruler relationship averting a tax hike without the consent of the people's representatives notably, the dignitaries (the [[Ulama]]).

Emergence of political parties in Egypt in the 19th century was a reflection of social, economic and cultural interactions as well as certain historical, national and political circumstances, leading to the creation and development of modern institutions of government administration and society, such as the parliament, cabinets, political parties, syndicates, etc. This emergence has been gradual and has gone through successive stages. Political parties have firstly been formed as secret societies that were followed by formation of political groups.

The [[National Party (Egypt)|National Party]] (NDP) was the first party, formed in 1907 by [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha]]. In less than ten years, there was a great variety in these parties; in their nature, formation, organization, power, their popular base and platforms. There were national parties, groups dominated by the royal palace, others formed by the occupation authority as well as ideological parties expressing certain ideologies.

From 1907 to 1920, the already-formed political parties in Egypt were a starting signal for the dissemination of further parties; however, they were restricted due to the British occupation and Egyptian subordination to the Ottoman Empire. The February 1922 [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence]] and the issuance of the [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|1923 Constitution]] led to the establishment a royal constitutional rule based on party pluralism and the principles of liberal democracy.

== Under the 1923 Constitution ==

After the end of World War I, the 1919 Egyptian Revolution broke out calling for liberty, independence and democracy. This revolution resulted in the 28 February 1922 declaration which recognized Egypt as an independent state (with some reservations) and terminated Egypt as a British protectorate.

Based on this new status, a new Egyptian Constitution was promulgated in April 1923 by a 30-member legislative committee that included representatives of political parties, as well as national movement leaders.

The [[1923 Constitution of Egypt]] was a previous working constitution of Egypt during the period 1923-1952. It was replaced by the 1930 Constitution for a 5-year period (1930–1935) before being restored in 1935. It adopted the parliamentary representative system based on separation of and cooperation among authorities. The Parliament was bicameral system made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

During 1923–1952 Egypt witnessed a remarkable experience rich in political and democratic practices, however, such an experience was marked with many defects such as the British occupation, foreign intervention in Egypt's affairs and the royal palace's interference in political life.

== Egyptian Parliamentary Bodies ==

=== High Council ===
In May 1805 the Ulama (religious scholars) of Al-Azhar led the lower-case mature democratic revolution Egypt witnessed. All classes of the society took part in that revolution whose leaders named  Mohammed Ali ?Wali (representative) of Egypt? before the Ottoman Sultan could send a wali of his own. Mohammed Ali had pledged his allegiance to the people based on the principle the nation is the source of authority. Those conditions stipulated that he administers justice, implements judgments and legislations, and acts only after their consultation; otherwise he would be removed?.

Immediately after assuming power, Mohamad Ali started a comprehensive administrative revolution with a view to establishing modern institutions, including a representative council.

In 1824, '''The High Council''' was established. It was the true beginning of a representative council whose members were partly elected and represented all classes of the people. At first it consisted of 24 members, then 48 members after adding 24 Sheikhs of Al-Azher university, two merchants were chosen by the merchants, Chief of the capital, two accountants, and two notables from each province who were elected by the populace.

In January 1825 the High Council issued a basic statute. It stated that its function was to discuss whatever Mohammad Ali suggested or postulated with regard to his domestic policy. The statute also stated session dates and procedures.

=== Consultation Council ===
In 1829, the High Council's success in performing its functions led to the establishment of the Consultation Council which was the starting point of the Shoura (consultation) system. It consisted of high-ranking government employees, Ulama, and dignitaries, chaired by Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Mohammad Ali. That Council was like a general assembly consisting of 156 members, 33 of whom were high-ranking employees and Ulama, 24 province superintendents, and 99 Egyptian dignitaries elected by the people.

The Consultation Council held its sessions to give consultation in the fields of education, administration, and public works. In 1830 that Council?s rules of procedure was issued, and in 1833 the Council enacted a special law to complement its rules of procedure and organize work of relevance.

In 1837 Mohammad Ali promulgated the '''State Basic Law''' which subtitled the Consultation Council with the Special Legislative Council and The General Legislative Council, to discuss the matters referred there-to by the government. Then the Cabinet was made up of seven basic Portfolios.

=== Representative Consultative Council ===
The year 1866 witnessed the most important development in Egyptian parliamentary life when Khedive Ismail  established the '''Advisory Council of Representatives'''. That Council was the first with representative functions. The Khedive decree on establishing this council was issued in November 1866, which included the standing order of rules and procedures of the council. The standing order consisted of eighteen articles that established the election system, candidate eligibility requirements and Assembly legislative terms. It included as well probing domestic affairs and forwarding recommendations to the Khedive. The Council's standing order and rules of procedure were highly influenced by contemporary European, particularly French, parliamentary systems.

The Advisory Council of Representatives consisted of 75 members elected by dignitaries in Cairo, Alexandria and Damietta, as well as the Undas, (village chiefs) and sheikhs in other provinces. They were elected for the first time in Khedive Ismail's reign, in addition to the Speaker who was appointed by a royal decree.

The Council's mandate was three years, and it remained in session for two months each year. It held nine sessions in three legislative terms (25 November 1866 – 6 July 1879).

With the lapse of time, the Council?s competences expanded, and opposition trends started to appear. This development emanated from the beacon schools spread by a group of leading intellects and writers, as well as newspapers, which stressed the need to establish a representative council that sustains more competences in legislation as much as in control.

In 1878 the first cabinet of ministers was created, and the parliament re-established and given more powers of exercise (although some matters, like financial affairs, remained outside its competences).

In June 1879, the new standing order of the Advisory Council of Representatives was prepared for issuance by the Khedive (Head of State). It stated that the Council consisted of 120 members for Egypt and the Sudan. The most important provision of that standing order was the accountability of the ministers. It gave the council more influence in financial matters. However, Khedive Tawfiq, who was crowned on 26, June 1879, derogated the standing order and abolished the Council. But the Council remained in session till July 1879.

=== Egyptian Representative Council ===
September 9, 1881, markedthe rise of the [[Orabi Revolution]]  which called for establishing the '''Council of Representatives'''. Elections were held according to the standing order issued in 1866. The new council called '''The Egyptian Council of Representatives''' was inaugurated on September 26, 1881, whereby a government decree was issued on February 7, 1882, pending the government's approval of a new basic law. That basic law held the Cabinet accountable to the Representative Council elected by the people, which had the authority to legislate and interpellate the minister. '''The Egyptian Council of Representatives''' term was five years, and each session was three months.

Thus, the basis of democratic practice were gradually established. However, this did not last long, as the Egyptian Council of Representatives had held one ordinary session (December 26, 1881 – March 26, 1882) before Britain occupied Egypt and repealed the basic law. 
In 1883, the so-called '''Regular Law''' was issued which constituted a setback to representative life in Egypt.

=== Laws Consultative Council ===
The '''Regular Law''' issued in 1883 stated that the Egyptian parliament consisted of two chambers: The Advisory Council of Laws and the General Assembly. It also established the Councils of Provinces whose function was administrative and legislative, and were entrusted with the election of members of the Advisory Council of Laws.

The Advisory Council of Laws whose term was 6 years consisted of 30 members: 14 appointed members including the Speaker and one of his two deputies, and 16 elected members, including the other Deputy Speaker. On the other hand, the General Assembly consisted of 83 members, 46 elected members and the rest were ex - officio members. The latter were members of the Advisory Council of Laws, whose speaker chaired the General Assembly, and seven ministers.

=== Legislative Assembly ===
In July 1913 both the Advisory Council of Laws and the General Assembly were dissolved, and the Legislative Assembly was established. It consisted of 83 members: 66 elected and 17 appointed. The Regular Law promulgated in July 1913 stated that the Legislative Assembly term would be six years. In fact, the Legislative Assembly lasted from January 22, 1914 till June 17, 1914 when World War I broke out and martial laws were declared in Egypt. Later in December 1914, Britain declared Egypt a British protectorate, and the legislative Assembly session was postponed indefinitely. In 1915 the Regular Law was suspended till the Legislative Assembly was dissolved in April 1923.

=== Under the 1923 Constitution ===
According to the [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|1923 Constitution]], The Egyptian Parliament was bi-cameral, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The constitution also adopted the principle of equal competences for the two houses with some exceptions.
All of the members of the House of Representatives were to be elected, for a 5-year term.
On the other hand, three fifths of the Senate members were elected, and the rest were appointed.

The number of members varied along the years the constitution was in effect. The House of Representatives, had 214 members in the period 1924–1930, then became 235.The number decreased under the 1923 Constitution which continued in effect during 1931–1934 to become 150. It increased once again under the 1923 Constitution to become 232 for the period 1936–1938. Then the number of members became 264 from 1938 to 1949. It was increased to 319 in 1950 and continued as such up till the 1952 revolution.

Although the parliament established by the 1923 constitution was an advanced step along the course of democracy and representation in Egypt. However, practice was mixed with numerous negative aspects.&lt;BR&gt;
Political life in the period 1923–1952 varied between tides of limited popular democracy and ebbs due to intervention by occupation forces and the palace, which led to the dissolution of parliament ten times. Moreover, a new constitution was issued in 1930, and lasted for five years. This was a setback to democratic life until  the 1923 constitution was restored in 1935.

Thus, constitutional conditions deteriorated due to internal and external reasons. This deterioration was reflected in a state of political and governmental instability to the extent that Egypt had developed 40 cabinets in the period 1923–1952.

== After the 1952 Revolution ==

=== Under the 1956 Constitution ===
In 1956, the new Constitution was proclaimed stipulating for the formation of the '''National Assembly''' on 22 July 1957 with the membership of 350 elected members.
However it effective until 10 February 1958, when the Egyptian-Syrian merger was given force and the 1956 Constitution revoked.

=== Under the UAR Constitution ===
The Provisional Constitution of the United Arab Republic was formulated in March 1958, and a joint National Assembly was established, its members were appointed (400 from Egypt and 200 from Syria). It first met on 21 July 1960 and lasted to 22 June 1961. Egypt and Syria were later separated on 28 September 1961.

=== Under the 1963 provisional Constitution ===
In March 1964, a further provisional Constitution was declared, giving birth to a 350-elected member National Assembly, half of whom at least from workers and farmers - in reaction to the then July 1961 socialist laws plus 10 members appointed by the [[President of Egypt|President of the Republic]]. This Assembly lasted from 26 March 1964 to 12 November 1968. New elections were held on 20 January 1969, and the Assembly was valid until 30 August 1971.

=== Under the 1971 Constitution ===
The Constitution was proclaimed to update the democratic representative system in assertion of the rule of law, independence of Judiciary, and party plurality. Growing democratic changes were discerned, bringing forth legal elections on multi - forum basis within the Arab Socialist Union - the only political gathering at the time.
Under the [[Constitution of Egypt|1971 Constitution]], The Egyptian Parliament was bi-cameral, made up of the [[People's Assembly of Egypt]] and the [[Shura Council]], with the membership of 454 members, including ten members appointed by the President of the Republic.

The Parliament met for one nine-month session each year: under special circumstances the President of the Republic could call an additional session. Even though the powers of the Parliament have increased since the 1980 Amendments of the Constitution, the Parliament lacked the powers to effectively balance the powers of the President.

In 1979, party-based legislative elections were conducted for the first time in Egypt after political parties were done with in the wake of the 1952 Revolution. Parties, formed according to the political parties law in 1977, had taken part in the said elections.

In 1980, the Shura Council was set up to broaden the scope of political and democratic participation.

Decreed amendments were introduced to the People's Assembly electoral system in pursuit of the best popular representation.

In 1983, the party-list and proportional representation were adopted as the electoral process, in which political parties participated. In 1986, a law modifying the electoral process, the basis of relating party lists to the individual majority system was issued.

However, experience yielded the return to the individual majority system in 1990. The Republic was divided into 222 constituencies, two members for each constituency, one at least from laborers and farmers.

====People's Assembly====
The People's Assembly was the lower house and was formed in 1971 as a result of the adoption of the new constitution. The Assembly is made up of 454 deputies, 444 of whom are directly elected while the remaining 10 are appointed by the President of the Republic. The Constitution reserves 50 percent of the Assembly's seats for "workers and farmers", one per each two seat constituency. The Assembly sits for a five-year term but can be dissolved earlier by the president. All seats are voted on in each election.

====Shura Council====
{{Main|Shura Council}}
The Shura Council was the upper house. Its name roughly translates into English as "the Consultative Council". The Council was created in 1980 through a constitutional amendment. The Council was composed of 264 members of which 174 members are directly elected and the 88 are appointed by the President of the Republic for six-year terms. Membership was rotating, with one half of the Council renewed every three years. The Shura Council's legislative powers were limited. On most matters of legislation, the People's Assembly retained the last word in the event of a disagreement between the two houses. The 130-year-old Shura Council building was completely burnt on 19 August 2008. The council was abolished in the 2013 draft constitution;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=50 member constitution committee eliminates Shura Council|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/87991/Egypt/Politics-/-member-constitution-committee-eliminates-Shura-Co.aspx|publisher=Ahram Online|accessdate=27 January 2014|date=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the constitution has been passed, meaning that the abolition is final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt constitution 'approved by 98.1 percent'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/01/egypt-constitution-approved-981-percent-201411816326470532.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|date=18 January 2014|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-2011 overthrow of Mubarak===
Parliament was dissolved repeatedly in the aftermath of the overthrow of Mubarak; first by the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] in 2011, then restored by order of elected president [[Mohamed Morsi]] in 2012, then dissolved by order of the interim president [[Adly Mansour]] in 2013.

His academic focus is in the areas of jurisprudence, political theory, and constitutional law, while his practice at the English Bar saw him in cases at the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] and at the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]. He is a member of [[Gray's Inn]].

==Early life and education==
Finnis was educated at [[St. Peter's College, Adelaide]] and the [[University of Adelaide]], where he was a member of [[St. Mark's College (University of Adelaide)|St. Mark's College]]. He obtained his [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B) degree there, winning a [[Rhodes scholarship]] to [[University College, Oxford]], in 1962, where he obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree with a thesis on the concept of judicial power, with reference to Australian federal constitutional law.&lt;ref name=finnishphd&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Oxford|url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:adade83d-c1fc-4d5a-b396-5813d5a93441|doi=|title=The idea of judicial power, with special reference to Australian law|first= John Mitchell|last=Finnis|date=1965|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.671295}}|website=ora.ox.ac.uk|oclc=694895648}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/profile/john.finnis |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907000846/http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/profile/john.finnis |archivedate= 7 September 2011 |df= }}, Oxford Law Faculty, retrieved 25 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1962, Finnis converted to Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Greenya, John (2018). ''Gorsuch: The Judge Who Speaks for Himself''. Threshold Editions. Page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finnis was a friend of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], also an Oxford graduate; and, in 1989, Finnis nominated her for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Aung San Suu Kyi won the prize but did not receive it until June 2012, when she recalled how her late husband, [[Michael Aris]], had visited her under house arrest and brought her the news "that a friend, John Finnis" had nominated her for the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|wRYyEk-5zoI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Finnis is a legal philosopher and author of ''[[Natural Law and Natural Rights]]'' (1980, 2011), a seminal contribution to the [[philosophy of law]] and a restatement of [[natural law]] doctrine. For Finnis there are seven basic goods; life, knowledge, play, aesthetic experience, sociability of friendship, practical reasonableness and religion. In his book on Finnis' student [[Neil Gorsuch]] while at Oxford University, John Greenya has described Finnis's views by stating: "Some of John Finnis's views are very controversial. For example, in defending his long-held position against same-sex marriage and same-sex coupling, he once compared them to bestiality."&lt;ref&gt;Greenya, John (2018). ''Gorsuch: The Judge Who Speaks for Himself''. Threshold Editions. Page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Life involves all aspects of vitality that enable a person to gain strong willpower. The second aspect of well-being is knowledge and is described as the pure desire to know, simply out of curiosity, as well as a concerning interest and desire for truth. The third aspect, play, is regarded as self-evident as there is no real point of performing such activities, only for pure enjoyment. Aesthetic experience is the fourth aspect and is considered similarly to play however; it does not essentially need an action to occur. The fifth aspect for Finnis is sociability where it is realised through the creation of friendships, that these relationships are fundamental goods. Practical reasonableness is the sixth basic good where it is one’s ability to use their intellect in deciding choices that ultimately shape one’s nature. The final basic good is religion; it encompasses the acknowledgment of a concern for a simplified distinct form of order, where an individual’s sense of responsibility is addressed; it is "all those beliefs that can be called matters of ultimate concern; questions about the point of human existence".

After discussing the basic goods it is argued that within the list there is no hierarchal order, as the basic goods are considered impossible to compare or measure. Finnis believes the goods are equally self-evident. Each of the basic goods can be considered the most important, as none of them can be reduced to simply a mechanism of achieving another. While technically the goods can be treated as superior to one another Finnis provides that each good is still fundamental where no priority value exists. 

Philosopher Stephen Buckle sees Finnis's list of proposed basic goods as plausible, but notes that "Finnis's account becomes more controversial when he goes on to specify the basic requirements of practical reasonableness". He sees Finnis's requirement that practical reason requires "respect for every basic value in every act" as intended both to rule out [[consequentialism]] in ethics and also to support the moral viewpoint of the [[Catholic Church]] on a range of contentious issues, including [[contraception]] and [[masturbation]], which in his view undermines its plausibility.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Buckle, "Natural Law" in Peter Singer (ed.), ''A Companion to Ethics''. Blackwell Publishers, 1997, ch. 13, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finnis's work on natural law ethics has been a source of controversy in both neo-Thomist and analytical circles. Craig Paterson sees his work as interesting because it challenges a key assumption of both neo-Thomist and analytical philosophy: the idea that a natural law ethics must be based upon an attempt to [[Is–ought problem|derive normative (or "ought") statements from descriptive (or "is") statements]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://philpapers.org/archive/PATAFA.1.pdf Aquinas, Finnis and Non-Naturalism], Craig Paterson, "Aquinas, Finnis and Non-Naturalism" in Craig Paterson &amp; Matthew Pugh (eds.), ''Analytical Thomism: Traditions in Dialogue''. Ashgate, 2006, ch. 9, pp. 171–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Andrew Sullivan]], Finnis has articulated "an intelligible and subtle account of homosexuality" based on the new natural law, a less biologically-based version of [[natural law]] theory. Finnis argues that the state should deter public approval of homosexual behaviour while refusing to persecute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation, basing this position not on the claim that homosexual sex is unnatural but on the idea that it cannot involve the union of procreation and emotional commitment that heterosexual sex can, and is therefore an assault on heterosexual union. Sullivan believes that such a conservative position is vulnerable to criticism on its own terms, since the stability of existing families is better served by the acceptance of those homosexuals who are part of them.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Andrew. ''Virtually Normal: An Argument About Homosexuality''. Picador: London, 1996. pp. 98–99&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as [[Stephen Macedo]] and [[Michael J. Perry]], have also criticised Finnis's views.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Edward, ''The Mismeasure of Desire: The Science, Theory, and Ethics of Sexual Orientation''. Oxford University Press, 1999. p. 356&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He has supervised several PhD students including [[Neil Gorsuch]]&lt;ref name=gorsuch&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=DPhil |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |title=The right to receive assistance in suicide and euthanasia, with particular reference to the law of the United States |first=Neil McGill |last=Gorsuch |date=2004 |url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:688e5b8c-bb06-4d86-abe0-440a7666ffc1|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.401384}} |website=ora.ox.ac.uk |oclc=59196002}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert P.

'''Just-in-time blocking''' is the practice of temporarily [[Block (Internet)|blocking]] [[internet access]] for people in a specific geographic area, to prevent them from accessing information or communicating with each other.

The first known instance of just-in-time blocking was documented by the [[OpenNet Initiative]] during the [[Kyrgyzstani parliamentary election, 2005|2005 Kyrgyz parliamentary elections]]. It's also been observed during the [[Belarusian presidential election, 2006|2006 Belarus presidential elections]], the [[Tajik presidential election, 2006|2006 Tajik presidential elections]], and is alleged to have taken place in [[Bahraini general election, 2006|Bahrain]], [[Ugandan general election, 2006|Uganda]], and [[Yemeni presidential election, 2006|Yemen]], during their 2006 presidential and parliamentary elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deibert|first1=Ronald|title=Access Denied: The Practice and Policy of Global Internet Filtering|date=2008|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=0262541963}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, internet watchdog organization [[Turkey Blocks]] identified two separate regional [[Internet shutdown|internet shutdowns]] commencing prior to the arrests of mayors in predominantly [[Kurds in Turkey|Kurdish]] [[Southeast Turkey|southeast of Turkey]], a mesaure believed to have been implemented by the government to prevent protests and limit critical media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-internet-idUSKBN12Z0H4|title=Turkey blocks access to Twitter, Whatsapp: internet monitoring group|date=2016-11-04|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://turkeyblocks.org/2016/09/11/internet-shutdown-turkey-southeast/|title=Internet shutdown in Turkey's Southeast|date=2016-09-11|website=Turkey Blocks|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://turkeyblocks.org/2016/10/27/new-internet-shutdown-turkey-southeast-offline-diyarbakir-unrest/|title=New internet shutdown in Turkey's Southeast: 8% of country now offline amidst Diyarbakir unrest|date=2016-10-27|website=Turkey Blocks|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Kingdom''' were political institutions in the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]]. While one assembly, the Curiate Assembly, had some legislative powers,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 18"&gt;Abbott, 18&lt;/ref&gt; these powers involved nothing more than a right to symbolically ratify decrees issued by the [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Kingdom#The King of Rome|king]]. The functions of the other assembly, the Calate Assembly, was purely [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious]]. During the years of the kingdom, the [[spqr|People of Rome]] were organized on the basis of units called [[Curia]].&lt;ref name="Abbott, 18"&gt;Abbott, 18&lt;/ref&gt; All of the People of Rome were divided amongst a total of thirty Curia,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 18"&gt;Abbott, 18&lt;/ref&gt; and membership in an individual Curia was hereditary. Each member of a particular family belonged to the same Curia. Each Curia had an organization similar to that of the early Roman family, including specific religious rites and common festivals.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 18"&gt;Abbott, 18&lt;/ref&gt; These Curia were the basic units of division in the two popular assemblies.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 33"&gt;Byrd, 33&lt;/ref&gt; The members in each Curia would vote, and the majority in each Curia would determine how that Curia voted before the assembly. Thus, a majority of the Curia (sixteen out of the thirty total Curia) were needed during any vote before either the Curiate Assembly or the Calate Assembly.

==Curiate Assembly==
[[Image:Platner - Ancient Rome city growth.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Growth of the city region during the kingdom]]

The Curiate Assembly (''Comitia Curiata'') was the only popular assembly with any political significance during the period of the Roman Kingdom,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 18"&gt;Abbott, 18&lt;/ref&gt; and was organized on the basis of the thirty curiae.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 19"&gt;Abbott, 19&lt;/ref&gt; The king presided over the assembly, and submitted decrees to it for ratification.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 19"&gt;Abbott, 19&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Kingdom#Other executive officials|interrex]] presided over the assembly during interim periods between kings (the ''[[interregnum]]''). After a king died, the interrex selected a candidate to replace the king.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 14"&gt;Abbott, 14&lt;/ref&gt; After the nominee received the approval of the [[Senate of the Roman Kingdom|Roman Senate]], the interrex held the formal election before the Curiate Assembly. After the Curiate Assembly elected the new king, and the Senate ratified that election, the interrex then presided over the assembly as it voted on the law that granted the king his legal powers (the ''[[lex curiata de imperio]]'').&lt;ref name="Abbott, 14"&gt;Abbott, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

On the ''[[Calends|kalends]]'' (the first day of the month), and the ''[[nones (calendar)|nones]]'' (the fifth or seventh day of the month), this assembly met to hear announcements.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 19"&gt;Abbott, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Announcements often dealt with matters such as the exact date of a future event (such as an upcoming ''kalends'') or any upcoming [[intercalary month]]s. Appeals heard by this assembly often dealt with questions concerning Roman family law.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 15"&gt;Abbott, 15&lt;/ref&gt; During two fixed days in the spring, the assembly was scheduled to meet to witness wills and adoptions.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 19"&gt;Abbott, 19&lt;/ref&gt; All other meetings were held on an as-needed basis.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 19"&gt;Abbott, 19&lt;/ref&gt; The assembly also had jurisdiction over the admission of new families to a curia, the transfer of families between two curiae, the transfer of individuals from plebeian to patrician status (or vice versa), or the restoration of citizenship to an individual.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 19"&gt;Abbott, 19&lt;/ref&gt; The assembly usually decided these matters under the presidency of the [[Pontifex Maximus]].&lt;ref name="Byrd, 33"&gt;Byrd, 33&lt;/ref&gt; Since this assembly was the principal legislative assembly,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 18"&gt;Abbott, 18&lt;/ref&gt; it was (theoretically) responsible for ratifying laws.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 19"&gt;Abbott, 19&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rejection of such laws by the assembly did not prevent their enactment. Sometimes, the Curiate Assembly reaffirmed a king's legal authority (called ''[[imperium]]''), and sometimes it ratified a decision to go to war.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 19"&gt;Abbott, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calate Assembly==
The Calate Assembly ("Comitia Calata") was the oldest of the [[Roman assemblies]]. Very little is known about this assembly. The Calate Assembly met on the [[Capitoline Hill]],&lt;ref name="Lintott, 49"&gt;Lintott, 49&lt;/ref&gt; and was also organized on the basis of the thirty Curia. The purpose of this assembly was not legislative or legal, but rather [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious]]. The Pontifex Maximus presided over the assembly, and it performed duties such as inaugurating priests and selecting [[Vestal virgins]].&lt;ref name="Lintott, 49"&gt;Lintott, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Legislature}}
{{Politics}}

A '''legislator''' (or '''lawmaker''') is a person who writes and passes [[law]]s, especially someone who is a member of a [[legislature]]. Legislators are usually [[politician]]s and are often elected by the people of the state. Legislatures may be supra-national (for example, the [[European Parliament]]), national (for example, the [[United States Congress]]), regional (for example, the [[National Assembly for Wales]]), or local (for example, [[Local government|local authorities]]).

==Overview==
The [[political theory]] of the [[separation of powers]] requires legislators to be different individuals from the members of the [[executive (government)|executive]] and the [[judiciary]]. Certain political systems adhere to this principle, others do not. In the [[United Kingdom]], for example, the executive is formed almost exclusively from legislators (members of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]) although the judiciary is mostly independent (until reforms in 2005, the [[Lord Chancellor]] uniquely was a legislator, a member of the executive (indeed, the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]), and a [[judge]], while until 2009 the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]] were both [[judge]]s and legislators as members of the [[House of Lords]], though by convention they did not vote in the House until retirement).

In continental European [[jurisprudence]] and legal discussion, "the legislator" (''le législateur'') is the [[abstract entity]] that has produced the laws. When there is room for [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], the intent of the legislator will be questioned, and the court is supposed to rule in the direction it judges to best fit the legislative intent, which can be difficult in the case of conflicting laws or constitutional provisions.

==Terminology==
The local term for a legislator is usually a derivation of the local term for the relevant legislature. Typical examples include
* Parliament: [[Member of Parliament]]
* Assembly: Member of the Assembly
* Senate: Senator
* House of Representatives: Representative
* Congress: [[Member of Congress]]
The generic term "deputy" may also be used, deriving from the concept that the legislator is "deputising" for the electorate of his [[electoral district]].

==Substitute legislator==
Some legislatures provide each legislator with an official "substitute legislator" who deputises for the legislator in the legislature if he or she is unavailable. [[Venezuela]], for example, provides for substitute legislators (''diputado suplente'') to be elected under Article 186 of its [[Constitution of Venezuela|1999 constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsj.gov.ve/legislacion/constitucion1999.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417173551/http://www.tsj.gov.ve/legislacion/constitucion1999.htm |archivedate=2014-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecuador]] and [[Panama]] also have substitute legislators.

'''Leo D. Stoller''' (born June 5, 1946) is an [[Americans|American]] self-styled "[[intellectual property]] [[entrepreneur]]" based in suburban [[Chicago]], Illinois. Stoller claimed rights to a large inventory of well-known [[trademark]]s and engaged in the assertive enforcement of those alleged trademark rights, threatening [[Trademark infringement|infringement]] [[lawsuit|action]] against people and companies who attempt to use similar marks.

Though he managed to obtain [[Brand licensing|license]] payments in some circumstances through [[demand letter]]s, Stoller lost some key challenges in federal court, and was sanctioned by United States regulators for filing thousands of motions.  A federal court labeled Stoller and his companies as "[[vexatious litigation|vexatious litigants]]" in 2005, and his [[bankruptcy]] filing from that year was converted to a [[liquidation]] in 2006 after the judge found Stoller's filing to have been made in bad faith.  On August 8, 2007, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of Stoller's trademark assets to the Society for the Prevention of Trademark Abuse, LLC.&lt;ref name="sale_order"&gt;''In re Leo Stoller, Debtor'', no. 05-B-64075 (N.D. Ill., Aug. 8, 2007); [[:File:05-B-64075-Order-2007-08-08.pdf|Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Approving Sales of Debtor's Assets]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Stoller's companies included Rentamark.com, Stealth Industries Inc., S Industries Inc., Sentra Sporting Goods U.S.A., and Central Manufacturing Company. Through these companies, Stoller has registered trademarks with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) for over 25 years including Stealth, Sentra, Dark Star, Air Frame, Triana, Stradivarius, Havoc, Chestnut, Trillium, White Line Fever, Fire Power, Love Your Body, and many others.

Stoller has filed oppositions to others' trademark applications with the USPTO [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] (TTAB) numerous times, and filed applications for extension of the deadline to file such oppositions even more times. Stoller claims a number of large and small companies have resolved trademark controversies.  When approaching infringers, Stoller is reported to document his claims with copies of letters which demonstrate capitulation with his demands.  Such letters are said to be from companies such as [[Sears Holdings Corporation|K-Mart]], and often marked "Confidential".

A list of thousands of proceedings involving Leo Stoller and his companies (Stealth Industries, Inc., Leo Stoller Stealth Industries Inc., Leo Stoller Central Mfg. Co, Central Mfg. Co., Central Mfg. Inc., Sentra Industries Inc.) can be found in the USPTO site.&lt;ref&gt;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Stealth%20Industries,%20Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Leo%20Stoller%20Stealth%20Industries,%20Inc.

Articles about Stoller have appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="moynihan"&gt;Moynihan, Colin, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/04/business/04stealth.html?ei=5090&amp;en=c28d9a3d86540f87&amp;ex=1278129600&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all He Says He Owns the Word 'Stealth' (Actually, He Claims 'Chutzpah,' Too)]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.&lt;ref name="ngo"&gt;Ngo, Emily (July 28, 2005).

==Notable litigation==

===9/11 charity charges===

In August 2002 the [[Illinois Attorney General]] filed suit against Stoller for illegally soliciting funds on behalf of victims of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] via his web site giveagiftonline.com.&lt;ref name="ilattygen"&gt;In 2003, Stoller and his proprietorships "Give a Gift Online," "American Conservation Society," and "Association Network Management" were named in a Consent Decree with the Illinois Attorney General. See Exhibit 54 in the Schmetterer opinion.&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve charities Stoller listed said they never received any money from Stoller, despite assurances on the site that "100 percent of all donations" would be forwarded. He was accused of not being a licensed charitable organization and listing charities without their permission.&lt;ref name="steverman"&gt;Benjamin Steverman (August 1, 2002). [http://mesh.medill.northwestern.edu/mnschicago/archives/2002/08/illinois_attorn.html Illinois Attorney General files suit against River Forrest man charged with Sept. 11 charity scam.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Medill News Service&lt;/ref&gt; Stoller paid a $2,000 fine and was barred from soliciting for charities in Illinois, but made no admission of wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="moynihan" /&gt;

===Trademark litigation===

====''S Industries, Inc. v. Centra 2000''====
In 1996 S Industries, Inc. filed suit alleging that Centra 2000, a producer of [[data management]] [[software]], infringed its/Stoller's "Sentra" trademark in violation of the [[Lanham Act]]. District Judge George W. Lindberg ruled in favor of Centra 2000, finding that S Industries did not hold a federal registration for the "Sentra" mark for use on computer hardware or software. Because S Industries' claims were, in the judge's view, completely unfounded and because its procedural maneuvering multiplied the cost of defending against the suit, Centra 2000 was awarded attorney's fees in July 1998.&lt;ref name="svcentral"&gt;''S Industries, Inc. v. Centra 2000, Inc.'' Case No. 96 C 3524&lt;/ref&gt; This was affirmed on appeal.&lt;ref name="svcentralappeal"&gt;''S Industries, Inc. v. Centra 2000, Inc.'' United States Court of Appeals For the Seventh Circuit Case No. 00-2462&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Columbia Pictures v. Stoller''====
When [[Columbia Pictures]] brought out the 2005 movie ''[[Stealth (film)|Stealth]]'',&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20051214134425/http://home.comcast.net/~jlw28129/05_C_2052.pdf Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v.

And he isn't kidding.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Chicago Jewish News''&lt;/ref&gt; but the studio responded by suing Stoller for [[declarative relief]].&lt;ref name="moynihan" /&gt;  The court entered a consent judgment and permanent injunction in favor of Columbia Pictures and against Stoller in November 2005.&lt;ref name=ColumbiaDocket&gt;''Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Leo Stoller ,'' no. 05-CV-02052, N.D. Illinois, docket report (January 5, 2007), retrieved from [https://ecf.ilnd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/ShowIndex.pl PACER], June 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2006, the parties stipulated to the dismissal of Stoller's counterclaims, and the case was closed in January 2007.&lt;ref name=ColumbiaDocket/&gt;

====''Central Manufacturing Co. v. Brett''====

A case decided by [[summary judgment]] on September 30, 2005, ''Central Manufacturing Co. v. Brett'',&lt;ref name="brett"&gt;''[http://images.chillingeffects.org/cases/Stoller_v_Brett.pdf Central Mfg Co. v. Brett]'' (No. 1:04-cv-03049 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 2005))&lt;/ref&gt; pitted a Stoller-owned company against [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall-of-Fame]] [[baseball]] player [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]], whose company, Brett Brothers Sports International Inc., sells a [[Baseball bat|bat]] under the name "Stealth".&lt;ref&gt;http://home.comcast.net/%7Ejlw28129/Stoller_Brett_Order.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It was alleged in this case that the use of that name infringed upon Stoller's trademark rights.

In its decision, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] determined that there was no [[Confusing similarity|likelihood of confusion]] where consumers would mistakenly regard Brett's bats as being from Stoller's company. The court also found that Stoller failed to provide adequate proof that his company and its licensees had even sold baseball-related merchandise at all. The court found likelihood of confusion in the opposite direction, found Brett's trademark rights to be senior, and hence canceled Stoller's (Central Manufacturing) registration. In the decision, the court described Stoller's tactics and enumerated dozens of unsuccessful infringement cases he had brought in that court.

Chief Judge Charles P. Kocoras from the Northern District of Illinois then issued a citation to Stoller after reviewing his "filing history" having filed at least "49 lawsuits in this court, individually or through one of his many wholly owned corporations". "The Executive Committee (of the Northern District of Illinois) in its capacity as the supervisor of the assignment of cases, has directed that Leo Stoller inform this court of any claim by him why the Executive Committee should not impose reasonable and necessary restraints upon Mr. Stoller's ability to file civil cases in this District." After a thorough review of Leo Stoller's entire filing history the Executive Committee of the Northern District of Illinois issued a decision stating that "the committee will take no further action in this matter."

On July 9, 2007, in an opinion that opened with a laudatory description of the George Brett "[[Pine Tar Incident]]", the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] affirmed the District Court's judgment, including the order for Stoller to pay Brett's [[attorney fees]].&lt;ref&gt;https://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/circs/7th/062083p.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{cite court

====''Central Mfg. Co. v. Pure Fishing, Inc.''====

Stoller and the "Central Mfg. Co. (a Delaware corporation)" sued a [[fishing tackle]] company, Pure Fishing, Inc. in February 2005 in Illinois for selling Spiderwire Stealth fishing line.&lt;ref name="purefishing"&gt;''Central Mfg. Co. v. Pure Fishing, Inc.'', No. 05 C 00725 (N.D. Ill.)&lt;/ref&gt; Pure Fishing denied infringement and counterclaimed alleging that Stoller's trademark business violated various state and federal laws against [[unfair business practices]]. Pure Fishing also acquired and asserted in another counterclaim ([[piercing the corporate veil]] and continuation of business theories) the unsatisfied 1998 sanction judgment that had been awarded to Centra 2000 against Stoller's S Industries, Inc.
Pure Fishing also showed that Stoller had signed his attorney's name to pleadings that were filed with the court.&lt;ref name="notice"&gt;Notice of Appearance for the corporate entities and a court-ordered Rule 11 certification as to the accuracy of facts in a Second Amended Complaint&lt;/ref&gt; Stoller's case was [[Motion (legal)|dismissed]] [[Prejudice (law)|with prejudice]] and default judgments entered against all corporate defendants for lack of prosecution and against Stoller as a sanction under Rule 11.

During Stoller's 2006 bankruptcy proceedings (see below), Pure Fishing went back to the district court for entry of a Final Judgment. On October 4, 2006, a federal court in Chicago entered final judgment in ''Central Mfg. Co., et al. v. Pure Fishing, Inc., et al.'' The Court declared the case to be "exceptional" under 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a) and ordered Central Mfg. to pay Pure Fishing’s costs, charges and disbursements, including a reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in the action. The court further ordered that Stoller and his companies were "[[Vexatious litigation|vexatious litigants]]" and barred them "from instituting any lawsuit or trademark opposition without prior leave of this Court pursuant to this Court’s authority under the [[All Writs Act]], 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a)."&lt;ref name="United States District Court Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division Complaint"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.roylance.com/Uploads/CentralMfgCo/Amended%20Answer%20and%20CC.pdf |format=PDF |title=Central Mfg.

Stoller filed a Notice of Appeal from the October 4 judgment and has moved to stay the enforcement of the said judgment pending the appeals.

On December 12, 2006, the Court entered judgment in favor of Pure Fishing, Inc. in the total amount of $969,751.81.&lt;ref name="banner"&gt;Press release (December 14, 2006).

====Target and Google trademark claims====

Stoller filed an opposition with the TTAB in April 2006 to [[Target Stores]] bulls-eye [[logo]].

In 2006, Stoller filed an opposition to [[Google]]'s attempt at registering a trademark to the name "Google" in the category of [[exercise ball]]s.  Stoller claims that the "Google" mark has become [[Genericized trademark|generic]], yet also claims that it infringes on prior alleged rights to the name held by Stoller's company.&lt;ref&gt;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-91170256-OPP-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The case against the Google mark, however, was dismissed with prejudice at the instigation of Stoller's [[trustee in bankruptcy]], who is empowered to take action in all cases in which Stoller and his companies are involved.&lt;ref&gt;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-92045778-CAN-39.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, on January 19, 2007, Google filed a suit against Stoller's companies alleging violations of the anti-[[racketeering]] [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roylance.com/Uploads/CentralMfgCo/Complaint%20FILED.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 2008 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a judgment in favor of Google, on the ground that the case had been pursued using contradictory principles, both treating those companies as extensions of Stoller himself, and as separate legal entities.  The case was remanded to the lower court for further action.  The court noted, however, that Stoller remained subject to an order "directing that all federal courts in [the Seventh Circuit] return unfiled any papers he submits directly or indirectly unless and until he pays a $10,000 fine we imposed against him in August 2007," and "he will have to pay the outstanding sanction or, as a practical matter, face certain default."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/tmp/DD0YWFTX.pdf ''Google, Inc. v.

====Other trademark activity====
On March 17, 2008, an entity calling itself the "Stoller Pension and Profit Sharing Plan" filed Application Serial No. 77/424,372 in the USPTO, claiming trademark rights to the word "Stealth" in the fields of boat accessories and various forms of sports equipment and apparel, with a first use in commerce dating back to 1981.&lt;ref&gt;United States Patent and Trademark Office, [http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=77424372 ser. no. 77/424,372], "STEALTH"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thettablog.blogspot.com/2008/03/hes-back-stoller-entity-files.html '' He's Back!? Stoller Entity Files Application to Register "STEALTH" in Three Classes''], the TTABlog, March 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This organization has filed a property tort suit against Countrywide Bank.

===Sanctions===
Several jurisdictions have imposed sanctions against Stoller in response to the cases and motions he has brought, and his conduct in prosecuting them.

* '''U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Trademark Trial and Appeal Board:''' In a July 14, 2006 order by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB), Stoller was sanctioned by the Board for filing more than 1100 requests of an extension of time to file oppositions for time period between November 2005 and March 2006.&lt;ref name="chapman"&gt;Chapman, Beth [http://www.oblon.com/media/index.php?id=320 Stoller Sanctioned By USPTO’s Trademark Trial &amp; Appeal Board.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023092658/http://www.oblon.com/media/index.php?id=320 |date=2006-10-23 }} Retrieved December 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Board vacated all the time extensions filed during that time period and prohibits Stoller from filing any additional extensions for two years.&lt;ref name="sams"&gt;Sams, J. David (July 14, 2006). [http://www.oblon.com/files/news/320.pdf Order of USPTO’s Trademark Trial &amp; Appeal Board.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023121627/http://www.oblon.com/files/news/320.pdf |date=2006-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stoller will be able to file extensions again after two years but only if the extension is filed by an [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]]. The appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The time for filing any appeal to the district court has lapsed.
* '''U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois:'''  On March 8, 2007, the Executive Committee for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois sanctioned Stoller and entered an injunction precluding him from filing any further lawsuits without first obtaining leave of court.&lt;ref name="NDILSanction"&gt;See ''[http://home.comcast.net/%7Ejlw28129/Stoller_Exec_Comm_Order.pdf IN RE: Leo Stoller]'' (No. 07-cv-01435 (N.D.

===Bankruptcy filings===
On March 1, 1985, Stoller filed for [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] relief in the [[United States bankruptcy court|U.S. Bankruptcy Court]] for the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois|Northern District of Illinois]], Case No. 85-02729.&lt;ref name="schmetterer"&gt;Jack B. Schmetterer (September 26, 2006). [http://www.ilnb.uscourts.gov/JudgeSchmetterer/Opinions/Stoller.pdf Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on Motion of Pure Fishing to Convert to Chapter 7.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719164850/http://www.ilnb.uscourts.gov/JudgeSchmetterer/Opinions/Stoller.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }} United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division Case No. 05 B 64075 (Chapter 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 1998, Stoller filed for bankruptcy in the Northern District of Illinois, Case No. 98-03288 (later withdrawn).&lt;ref name="schmetterer"/&gt;

In 2001, Stoller made a bankruptcy filing for his litigation entity, S Industries, Inc., that was filed during the appeal of the ''S Industries, Inc. v. Centra'' 2000 decision (N.D. Ill. 1998) that had levied sanctions against S Industries for oppressive litigation.&lt;ref name="roylancepubs"&gt;See discussion at [http://www.roylance.com/publications.asp Roylance, Abrams, Berdo &amp; Goodman Stoller collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206173141/http://roylance.com/publications.asp |date=2006-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 2005, Stoller filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 13, before a final judgment could be entered in the ''Pure Fishing'' case.&lt;ref name="bankrupt13"&gt;Stoller, Leo (December 20, 2005). [http://www.roylance.com/Uploads/CentralMfgCo/Voluntary%20petition%2012-20-05.pdf United States Bankruptcy Court Voluntary Petition, Case No. 05-64075.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230153741/http://roylance.com/Uploads/CentralMfgCo/Voluntary%20petition%2012-20-05.pdf |date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His petition listed $183,000 in general unsecured claims.&lt;ref name="13plan"&gt;Stoller, Leo (17 January 2006). [http://www.roylance.com/Uploads/CentralMfgCo/ch%2013%20plan.pdf Stoller Chapter 13 plan.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101172632/http://roylance.com/Uploads/CentralMfgCo/ch%2013%20plan.pdf |date=2007-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This had the effect of an automatic stay on the litigation. Although the case against the corporate entities might have continued, Judge Lindberg stayed the case against those entities as well "in view of the unique relationship" between Stoller and his corporate entities.
Pure Fishing filed a claim in the bankruptcy case and asked the court to convert Stoller's case from Chapter 13 (debtor controlled reorganization) to [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]]  (liquidation),&lt;ref name="schmetterer"/&gt; with the immediate appointment of a trustee to manage the financial estate. Following a trial on the motion in August 2006, the case was immediately converted with trustee Richard M. Fogel appointed on September 5, 2006.&lt;ref name="neary"&gt;Neary, William T. (September 5, 2006). [http://www.roylance.com/Uploads/CentralMfgCo/Trustee%20letter%20of%20appointment.pdf Trustee letter of appointment for Richrd M. Fogel.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The detailed opinion by Judge Jack B. Schmetterer of the bankruptcy court spells out in great detail how Stoller operated his business. A Notice of Appeal was  filed by Stoller, who also moved to stay all proceedings pending resolution of his appeal. Stoller has also moved to disqualify the trustee on the grounds that he is biased and prejudiced against Stoller and not operating within the best interest of the estate. The court denied Stoller's motion, and Stoller's appeal was denied.

On October 5, 2006, trustee Richard M. Fogel's authority was extended to include actions as sole shareholder of all corporate entities owned or controlled by Stoller,&lt;ref name="trustee2"&gt;See USPTO [http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-91164582-OPP-29.pdf Agreed Motion to Dismiss in Opposition No. 91164582] at Page 3: Order authorizing the Trustee to act on behalf of debtor's {{sic|hide=y|wholly|-}}owned corporations and related relief.] October 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; thus relieving Stoller of his ability to act as a representative of his corporations or proprietorships.&lt;ref name="fogel"&gt;Welch, John L.

On August 8, 2007, the bankruptcy court approved an auction and sale under which Stoller's trademark assets were transferred to the Society for the Prevention of Trademark Abuse, LLC, the sole bidder in the auction, for $7,500.&lt;ref name="sale_order"/&gt;&lt;ref name="johnsonletter"&gt;[http://home.comcast.net/%7Ejlw28129/SPTA_letter_to_J_Welch.pdf Letter from Lance Johnson to John Welch]&lt;/ref&gt;

The preliminary finding under the [[United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] is a range of 30 to 37 months imprisonment, in addition to any court-imposed [[supervised release]], fine or [[restitution]].&lt;ref name=pleaagreement/&gt;  The prosecution has asked for Stoller to be sentenced to 37 months in prison, based on Stoller's "egregious and ceaseless abuse of the federal court system" and because there is "nothing about the defendant’s history and characteristics that suggests that he will not re-offend in the future."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v.

A '''master contract''' or '''master agreement''' is a [[collective bargaining]] agreement which covers all [[trade union|unionized]] worksites in an industry, market or company, and which establishes the terms and conditions of employment common to all workers in the industry, market or company.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;Najita, Joyce, and Roberts, Harold S.

No date.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412220224/http://labored.missouri.edu/Historic%20Models%20of%20Collective%20Bargaining%20in%20the%20U.S.htm |date=2008-04-12 }} Accessed July 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Korea Shipping Corporation v. New York Shipping Association-International Longshoremen's Association Pension Trust Fund,'' [[case citation|880 F.2d 1531]] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

==About master contracts==
A master contract may be geographically limited and occur at the local, regional or national level. It may also be limited to a specific market, whether local, regional or national.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, Patrick; Higgins, Jr, John E.; Hexter, Christopher T.; and Neighbours, John T. ''The Developing Labor Law: The Board, the Courts, and the National Labor Relations Act.'' 4th ed. Washington, D.C.: BNA Books, 2002. {{ISBN|1-57018-151-9}}; Williams, Steve and Adam-Smith, Derek. ''Contemporary Employment Relations: A Critical Introduction.'' Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-927243-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a master contract governs the general terms of employment that apply uniformly across the company or industry, master contracts often provide for local terms to be negotiated.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Some master contracts may also permit local or regional variations in order to meet special economic, competitive, or other circumstances for a union or company.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; For example, in the early 1980s the [[United Auto Workers]] exempted [[Chrysler]] from the master contract governing the U.S. auto industry because the company was in deep financial trouble.&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;Levin, Doron P. "Chrysler Makes Plea To U.A.W." ''New York Times.'' July 21, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Master contracts are common in the automobile manufacturing, shipping, package express, mining (especially coal mining), and general manufacturing industries. For example, the UAW and the [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|"Big Three" American automakers]] tend to operate in this pattern: the union selects one manufacturer with which it does most of its negotiation; when an agreement is reached, the union attempts to apply the same contract to the others.&lt;ref name="LaborEducation" /&gt; Other areas where master agreements can be found include tire manufacturing,&lt;ref&gt;Brus, Brian. "Bridgestone/Firestone, Union Negotiators Reach Master Contract." ''Oklahoma City Journal Record.'' June 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; public education,&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Kris. "Spencer Teachers' 2008-09 Master Contract Ratified." ''Spencer Daily Report.'' May 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; baking,&lt;ref&gt;Cimini, Michael H. and Muhl, Charles J. "Master Contract at Philip Morris." ''Monthly Labor Review.''  May 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; custodial and housekeeping services,&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, Alex. "OneSource, SEIU Union Reach Contract for Tufts Janitors." ''Tufts Daily.'' September 22, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Rauber, Chris. "CHW Hospitals Deliver Union Contract After Short Labor." ''San Francisco Business Times.'' April 25, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the goal of a master agreement is to standardize pay and benefit conditions in a market or industry so that employers compete on the grounds of quality services, quality products, or improved [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]].&lt;ref&gt;Brisbin Jr., Richard A. ''A Strike Like No Other Strike: Law and Resistance During the Pittston Coal Strike of 1989-1990.'' Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-8018-6901-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Royle"&gt;Royle, Tony and Towers, Brian. ''Labour Relations in the Global Fast-food Industry.'' New York: Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-22167-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Master contracts also make it easier for newly organized workers, who get rolled into existing contract rather than having to negotiate their own first contract (with the risk that negotiations may drag on or collapse, causing the new union to eventually collapse).&lt;ref name="Royle" /&gt;

[[Closed shop|Traditionally]], such contracts have been struck as exclusive class actions between the whole class of workers and the whole class of (or a single) employer(s), excluding the employment of any workers outside of it. In the [[Right to work state|United States]] in particular there has been pressure from the employing class generally on this.

==Strategy==
When negotiating a master contract, the union often selects the financially strongest employer or worksite to negotiate with it. This agreement becomes the master contract, and [[pattern bargaining|sets the pattern]] for bargaining with the other employers or worksites.&lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"USWA Names Goodyear Target for Master Contract Talks." ''Rubber &amp; Plastics News.'' April 14, 2003; Freeman, Sholnn. "Union Picks GM to Lead Contract Talks." ''Washington Post.'' September 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Master contracts can also be used strategically for other ends such as organizing and to break down employer resistance to collective bargaining. In Canada, unions have used master contracts to organize thousands of new workers. A master agreement has tended to weaken an employer's resistance to the spread of the union to unorganized worksites or divisions, and some industries and markets welcome the standardization of pay and fringe benefits that unionization brings.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, Charlotte. "Expanding Labour's Horizons: Union Organizing and Strategic Change in Canada." ''Just Labour.'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, some unions have sought to create master agreements which provide for a neutrality agreement, code of conduct for the organizing election, or neutral third-party oversight of an election in order to make union organizing easier.&lt;ref name="Kutalik"&gt;[http://www.labornotes.org/node/1054 Kutalik, Chris. "Two Unions Enter Recognition Pact with Health Care Company." ''Labor Notes. July 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some master agreements even state that new workers will automatically come under the master agreement.&lt;ref name="Kutalik" /&gt; Master bargaining also reduces the likelihood that employers will refuse to bargain or seek to whittle away at unionization workplace by workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbrother, Peter and Yates, Charlotte. ''Trade Unions in Renewal: A Comparative Study.'' New York: Routledge, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8264-5437-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some union members criticize master contracts for submerging local differences, and for being undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;The claim is that by permitting thousands or even tens of thousands of members to vote on a contract, the master contract makes it impossible for the contract's opponents to muster enough votes across all workplaces to defeat the contract.  For an example, see: [http://www.uniondemocracy.com/UDR/66-ILA%20dockers%20against%20contract.htm Biers, Carl and Niemeijer, Marsha. "Dockworkers Campaign Against ILA Master Agreement." ''Union Democracy Review.'' June–July 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics point to master contracts which impose certain fundamental terms and conditions of employment (such as wages, fringe benefits, pensions and certain working conditions) as being nothing more than [[company union]]ism.&lt;ref name="Kutalik" /&gt; In the United States, unions have engaged in bitter battles over such master agreements in California and Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://labornotes.org/taxonomy/term/55?from=15 Gaus, Mischa. "Quiet Deal Leads to Bitter Fight in Ohio Hospitals." ''Labor Notes.'' April 2008]; [http://labornotes.org/node/1556 Brenner, Mark. "Health Care Local Charges SEIU Is Shutting Members Out of Bargaining &amp; Organizing." ''Labor Notes.'' March 2008]; White, Ronald D. "Unions Battle for Nurses." ''Los Angeles Times.'' August 3, 2003; Lando, Tamar. "Union Triage." ''L.A. Weekly.'' September 25, 2003; Kaplan, Esther. "Labor's Growing Pains." ''The Nation.'' June 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], master contracts proved so contentious that they were essentially outlawed under the 1996 [[WorkChoices]] legislation and its 2005 amendments.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Jill. "Work Choices and the Radical Revision of the Public Realm of Australian Statutory Labour Law." ''Industrial Law Journal.'' December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Misuse of Drugs Act''' is a drug control law in Singapore classifying substances into three categories, Classes A, B, and C. Section 44 provides that "The Minister may, by an order published in the Gazette" add, remove, or transfer drugs among the classes. The statute's penal provisions are severe by most nations' standards, providing for long terms of [[imprisonment]], [[Caning in Singapore|caning]], and [[capital punishment in Singapore|capital punishment]]. The law creates a presumption of trafficking for certain threshold amounts, e.g. 30&amp;nbsp;grams of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. It also creates a presumption that a person possesses drugs if he possesses the keys to a premises containing the drugs, and that "Any person found in or escaping from any place or premises which is proved or presumed to be used for the purpose of smoking or administering a controlled drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been smoking or administering a controlled drug in that place or premises." Thus, one runs the risk of arrest for drug use by simply being in the company of drug users. The law also allows officers to search premises and individuals, without a [[search warrant]], if he "reasonably suspects that there is to be found a controlled drug or article liable to seizure". Moreover, Section 31 allows officers to demand [[urinalysis]] of suspected drug offenders.

The '''Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity''', also known as the '''Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS)''' is a 2010 supplementary agreement to the 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD). Its aim is the implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources, thereby contributing to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cbd.int/abs/about/|title= Nagoya Protocol}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are concerns that the added bureaucracy and legislation will, overall, be damaging to the monitoring and collection of biodiversity, to conservation, to the international response to infectious diseases, and to research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/02/plea-open-science-zika|title=A plea for open science on Zika|website=www.sciencemag.org|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protocol was adopted on 29 October 2010 in [[Nagoya]], Japan, and entered into force on 12 October 2014. It has been ratified by 114 parties, which includes 113 [[UN member states]] and the [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbd.int/abs/nagoya-protocol/signatories/default.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;. It is the second protocol to the CBD; the first is the 2000 [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]].

==Scope==

The Nagoya Protocol applies to genetic resources that are covered by the CBD, and to the benefits arising from their utilization. The protocol also covers traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources that are covered by the CBD and the benefits arising from its utilization

==Obligations==
The Nagoya Protocol sets out obligations for its contracting parties to take measures in relation to access to genetic resources, benefit-sharing and compliance.

===Access obligations===
Domestic-level access measures aim to:
*Create legal certainty, clarity, and transparency
*Provide fair and non-arbitrary rules and procedures
*Establish clear rules and procedures for prior informed consent and mutually agreed terms
*Provide for issuance of a permit or equivalent when access is granted
*Create conditions to promote and encourage research contributing to biodiversity conservation and sustainable use
*Pay due regard to cases of present or imminent emergencies that threaten human, animal, or plant health
*Consider the importance of genetic resources for food and agriculture for food security

===Benefit-sharing obligations===
Domestic-level benefit-sharing measures aim to provide for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources with the contracting party providing genetic resources. Utilization includes research and development on the genetic or biochemical composition of genetic resources, as well as subsequent applications and commercialization. Sharing is subject to mutually agreed terms. Benefits may be monetary or non-monetary such as royalties and the sharing of research results.

===Compliance obligations===
Specific obligations to support compliance with the domestic legislation or regulatory requirements of the contracting party providing genetic resources, and contractual obligations reflected in mutually agreed terms, are a significant innovation of the Nagoya Protocol.

Contracting parties are to:
*Take measures providing that genetic resources utilized within their jurisdiction have been accessed in accordance with prior informed consent, and that mutually agreed terms have been established, as required by another contracting party
*Cooperate in cases of alleged violation of another contracting party's requirements
*Encourage contractual provisions on dispute resolution in mutually agreed terms
*Ensure an opportunity is available to seek recourse under their legal systems when disputes arise from mutually agreed terms (MAT)
*Take measures regarding access to justice
*Monitor the use of genetic resources after they leave a country by designating effective checkpoints at every stage of the value-chain: research, development, innovation, pre-commercialization, or commercialization

===Implementation===
The Nagoya Protocol's success will require effective implementation at the domestic level. A range of tools and mechanisms provided by the Nagoya Protocol will assist contracting parties including:
*Establishing national focal points (NFPs) and competent national authorities (CNAs) to serve as contact points for information, grant access, or cooperate on issues of compliance
*An Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House to share information, such as domestic regulatory ABS requirements or information on NFPs and CNAs
*Capacity-building to support key aspects of implementation.

Based on a country's self-assessment of national needs and priorities, capacity-building may help to:
*Develop domestic ABS legislation to implement the Nagoya Protocol
*Negotiate mutually-agreed terms
*Develop in-country research capability and institutions
*Raise awareness
*Transfer technology
*Target financial support for capacity-building and development initiatives through the GEF

===Relationship between the Nagoya Protocol and other international agreements===
A growing number of [[Preferential trading area|Preferential Trade Agreements]] (PTAs) include provisions related to access to genetic resources or to the sharing of the benefits that arise out of their utilization. Indeed, some recent trade agreements, originating notably from Latin American countries, provide specific measures designed to facilitate the implementation of the ABS provisions contained in the Nagoya Protocol, including measures related to technical assistance, transparency and dispute settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Frédéric Morin and Mathilde Gauquelin, Trade Agreements as Vectors for the Nagoya Protocol's Implementation, CIGI papers, no 115, 2016, http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/paper_no.115.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;  

===Criticism===
Many scientists have voiced concern over the protocol, fearing the increased red tape will hamper disease prevention and conservation efforts&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6396/1405.full|title= When the cure kills—CBD limits biodiversity research|website=science.sciencemag.org|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and that the threat of possible imprisonment of scientists will have a chilling effect on research.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nature.com/news/biopiracy-ban-stirs-red-tape-fears-1.16028|title= Biopiracy ban stirs red-tape fears}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Non-commercial biodiversity researchers and institutions such as [[natural history museum]]s fear maintaining biological reference collections and exchanging material between institutions will become difficult.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/05/05/biosci.biv056.short?rss=1|title= The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing—International treaty poses challenges for biological collections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York International Arbitration Center (NYIAC) is an independent not-for-profit organization focused on providing hearing center services for [[Arbitration|international arbitrations]], [[mediations]] and other forms of [[alternative dispute resolution]] under any arbitration rules. NYIAC does not administer hearings, but provides hearing rooms, breakout rooms, neutral areas and on-site support for dispute resolution cases. In addition, NYIAC organizes educational events and focuses on advancing and promoting international arbitration in New York by inviting practitioners to be involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York International Arbitration Center to Open this  Spring|url=http://cdn2.winston.com/images/content/1/4/v2/1417.pdf |publisher=Winston &amp; Strawn |accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About NYIAC|url=https://nyiac.org/about|publisher=New York International Arbitration Center|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nova Scotia (Board of Censors) v McNeil''''', [1978] 2 S.C.R. 662 is a famous pre-[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]] decision from the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on [[freedom of expression]] and the [[criminal law]] power under the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]. The film [[censorship]] laws of the province of [[Nova Scotia]] were challenged on the basis that it constituted criminal law which could only be legislated by the federal government.  The Court held that though the censorship laws had a moral dimension to it, the laws did not have any prohibition or penalty required in a criminal law.

==Background==
The Amusement Regulation Board of Nova Scotia, created under the ''Theatre and Amusement Act'', banned the film ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' from being shown in the province. McNeil, a journalist, attempted to challenge the law on the basis that it was a constitutionally invalid law.

The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the regulation of morality alone constitutes a criminal law. In a five to four decision the Court held that the law was concerning property and civil rights under section 92(13) of the B.N.A. Act and not criminal law.

==Reasons of the court==
Ritchie J., writing for the majority found that the [[pith and substance]] of the Act concerned the "regulation, supervision and control" of film, a form of private property, in the province. Consequently, the law was strictly a matter of Property and Civil Rights, a matter that was in the exclusive jurisdiction of the province. Further, Ritchie applied the definition of Criminal law from the ''[[Margarine Reference]]'' case which required that a criminal law must concern the public interest and must consist of a prohibition with a penalty. Ritchie found that there was no clear prohibition because the law did not provide details on what was prohibited, rather, it left it to the discretion of the board.

==Dissent==
[[Bora Laskin|Laskin CJ.]], in dissent, found that the law had no connection with Property and Civil Rights. Laskin identified the law as [[legal burden of proof|colourable]]. In form it concerned property but in substance it concerned the regulation of "taste". He noted how the province had already unsuccessfully attempted to prosecute the distributor of the film under the obscenity laws of the Criminal Code, and saw this as another attempt at the same goal.

The '''Order of La Pléiade''' ({{Lang-fr|Ordre de la Pléiade de l'Association des parlementaires de langue française}})&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes referred to in English as the Order of the Pleiades: http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=2947&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[order (honour)|honorary order]] of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]]. It recognizes people who particularly distinguished themselves in the service of its ideals of cooperation and friendship, promoting the role of the [[French language]] in their own countries or in the world. It was created in 1976 on initiative of the [[Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie]]. 

== Origin of the name ==
In this reverse chronological list, each item intentionally referred to the following (historically preceding) one:

# '''Order of La Pléiade''';
# [[La Pléiade]], a group of (originally seven) [[French Renaissance literature|French Renaissance]] poets;
# the [[Alexandrian Pleiad]] of seven [[Alexandria]]n poets and tragedians (3rd century B.C.);
# the seven main stars of the [[Pleiades|Pleiades star cluster]] in the western astronomical tradition, and the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiades]], seven sisters in the Greek mythology.

== Classes ==
There are five classes (in descending [[order of precedence]]):
# ''[[Grand Cross]]'' (Grand-croix)
# ''Grand Officer'' (Grand Officier)
# ''Commander'' ([[Commandeur]])
# ''Officer'' (Officier)
# ''Knight'' (Chevalier)

== Insignia ==
The ''badge'' of the Order of La Pléiade is a seven-pointed star, blue enameled at both sides. The obverse&lt;ref&gt;For "obverse" and "reverse", see: [[Obverse and reverse]]&lt;/ref&gt; silver central disc features a silver-colored [[compass rose]], surrounded by a blue enamel and silver edged ring with the text "la Pléiade, ordre de la Francophonie", itself surrounded by seven small silver stars. The reverse silver central disc features the [[Adolphe Bridge]] in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]], where the [[Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie]] was founded, and symbolizes unity.

The [[ribbon]] is [[sky blue]] with small yellow stripes near each border.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11906">{{Politics of France}}
In [[Politics of France|French politics]], an '''''ordonnance''''' ({{IPA-fr|ɔʁdɔnɑ̃s|lang|Fr-ordonnance.ogg}}, "order") is a [[statutory instrument]] issued by the [[Council of Ministers of France|Council of Ministers]] in an area of law normally reserved for [[primary legislation]] enacted by the [[French Parliament]].  They function as temporary statutes pending ratification by the Parliament; failing ratification they function as mere executive regulations.

''Ordonnances'' should not be confused with ''[[décret]]s'' issued by the [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]] (an [[Order in Council#France|order-in-council]]) or [[president of France|president]], or with [[ministerial order]]s (''arrêtés''); these are issued either in matters where the [[Constitution of France|Constitution]] allows primary legislation from the Council or as secondary legislation implementing a statute.
[[File:Pyramide des normes.png|thumb|[[:fr:Hiérarchie des normes en droit français|Hierarchy of French legal norms]]]]
In the [[Judiciary of France|French justice system]], the word can also refer to a summary ruling made by a single judge for simple cases.

==Current usage==
===Motivations===
Article 34 of the [[Constitution of France]] restricts certain legal matters to [[statute law|primary legislation]] to be enacted by [[Parliament of France|Parliament]]. All other areas of law fall within the domain of delegated legislation in the form of orders-in-council (OIC) issued by the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] or ministerial orders issued by individual cabinet ministers.

Orders-in-council and other [[secondary legislation|delegated legislation]] issued in areas reserved for primary legislation are illegal, unless they are specifically authorized by statute. Such orders define implementation measures and details left out by the originating statute.

For various reasons explained below, the Executive may sometimes want to pass [[primary legislation]] in a field reserved by statute. The ''ordonnances'' are the constitutional means to do so.

Delegated legislation can be repealed through litigation before the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] (acting in their role of legislative review) if they violate general legal principles or constitutional rights, whereas primary legislation may be ruled unconstitutional only through judicial review before the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]]. Statutes are thus relatively more solid.

===Vocabulary notes===
The decisions made by the [[President of France|French President]] under art. 16 of the French Constitution, enabling him to take emergency measures in times where the existence of the Republic is at stake (a form of [[reserve powers]]) are not called ''ordonnances'', but simply ''décisions''.

The introductory sentence of an ''ordonnance'', as published in the [[Journal Officiel de la République Française]], is: "The President of the Republic [...], after hearing the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], after hearing the Council of Ministers, orders:". The word ''ordonnance'' comes from the same root as ''ordonner'' "to order".

===Procedure===
====Normal procedure====
In the [[French Fifth Republic]], most ''ordonnances'' operate pursuant to article 38 of the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]].

The Council of Ministers first introduces a bill before Parliament authorizing it to issue ''ordonnances'' to implement its program. The bill specifies a limited period of time, as well as a topic for the proposed ''ordonnances''. If the bill passes in Parliament, the French Cabinet can issue ''ordonnances'' on the given legal matter within the specified time period. The Executive must consult the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] on every ''ordonnance''; the advice of the Council is compulsory but nonbinding.

An ''ordonnance'' must be signed by the French President, the Prime Minister and relevant ministers. This proved in 1986 to be a source of tension, during a period of [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]] when President [[François Mitterrand]] and Prime Minister [[Jacques Chirac]] were of opposite political opinions, and the President refused to sign ''ordonnances'' requested by the Prime Minister, forcing him to go through the normal parliamentary procedure;&lt;ref&gt;Jean V. Poulard, “The French Double Executive and the Experience of Cohabitation”, ''Political Science Quarterly'', vol. 105, no. 2 (Summer 1990): [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2151025 243-267]&lt;/ref&gt; it was however controversial at the time whether he had the right to refuse to sign them.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Parodilien, “[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rfsp_0035-2950_1997_num_47_3_395180 Proportionnalisation périodique, cohabitation, atomisation partisane : un triple défi pour le régime semi-présidentiel de la Cinquième République]”, ''Revue française de science politique'', vol 47, no. 3-4 (1997): 292-312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valérie Moureaud, “[http://www.repas-senat.fr/docs/2/article3.pdf Le refus de signature des ordonnances en 1986 : un enjeu structurant en période de cohabitation]”, ''Revue d'étude politique des assistants parlementaires'', no. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the time period has elapsed, the Cabinet must introduce before Parliament a bill of [[ratification]] for the ''ordonnances'', otherwise these lapse at the end of the period. Until Parliament has voted the ratification bill, the ''ordonnances'', similar to executive orders, can be challenged before the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]].

If they are ratified, they become like ordinary statutes. There is, however, no obligation that they should be ratified, in which case they are mere regulations; in fact, between 1960 and 1990, out of 158 ''ordonnances'', only about 30 were ratified.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance0.html#toc3 Les ordonnances - bilan au 31 décembre 2007]'', section I&lt;/ref&gt; This can happen because even though the ratification bill has been brought before Parliament, it is not necessarily scheduled for examination and vote. If Parliament votes down the ratification bill, it does not go into effect.

The Constitutional Council and the Council of State have admitted that ratification, in addition to explicit means (vote on the ratification bill, or ratification amendment added to another bill), could also be performed ''implicitly'', when Parliament refers to an ''ordonnance'' as though it were a statute.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance2.html#toc94 Les ordonnances - bilan au 31 décembre 2007]'', section III C&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Castaing"&gt;Cécile Castaing, “La ratification implicite des ordonnances de codification. Haro sur « La grande illusion »”, ''Revue française de droit constitutionnel'', no. 58 (2004/2): 275-304, [[P.U.F.]], {{ISBN|978-2-13-054645-0}}, {{DOI|10.3917/rfdc.058.0275}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, implicit ratification was prohibited by [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008|a 2008 constitutional amendment]].

It has occasionally happened that the Executive did not make use of the authorization that they had requested and obtained.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance0.html#toc19 Les ordonnances - bilan au 31 décembre 2007]'', section I A 3&lt;/ref&gt;

====Budget bills====
It is of particular importance that budget bills should be voted in a timely manner, since they authorize taxes and spending. For this reason, the Government can adopt the budget by ''ordonnances'' if Parliament has not been able to agree on it within 70 days after the proposal of the budget (Constitution, article 47). The same applies for social security budget bills, but with a 50-day period (Constitution, article 47-1).

Neither of these procedures has ever been used.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance0.html#toc3 Les ordonnances - bilan au 31 décembre 2007]'', introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

====Overseas territories====
Article 74-1 of the Constitution allows the Government to extend legislation applicable to [[Metropolitan France]] to overseas territories by ''ordonnances''. These ''ordonnances'' lapse if they have not been ratified within 18 months by Parliament.

===Usage and controversy===

The use of ''ordonnances'' is not controversial when used for technical, uncontroversial texts (such as the ordinances that converted all sums in [[French Franc]]s to [[Euro]]s in the various laws in force in France).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX0000009L Law 2000-517] authorized the government to adopt ordinances to convert sums from Francs to Euros in various legislative texts.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ordonnances'' are also used to adopt and adapt [[European Directives]] into French law in order to avoid delayed adoption of a Directive, which often happens and is criticized by the [[EU Commission]] and exposes France to fines.

''Ordonnances'' are also used to codify law into codes, in order to rearrange them for the sake of clarity without substantially modifying them. Such usage has however been criticized for the legal risks that it poses if the ratification act is never voted.&lt;ref name="Castaing"/&gt;

The use of ''ordonnances'' for controversial laws is generally criticized by the opposition as anti-democratic, and demeaning to Parliament (Guillaume, 2005), in much the same way as the use of [[Article 49 of the French Constitution#Commitment of responsibility on a bill (49.3)|article 49-3]] to force a bill to be voted.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Rullier, ''Le Parlement sous la onzième législature 1997-2002'', Revue française de droit constitutionnel, n° 54 2003/2, pp. 429 - 447, {{ISBN|978-2-13-053967-4}}, {{DOI|10.3917/rfdc.054.0429}}: the former chief of staff of the Minister for relations with Parliament during the [[Lionel Jospin|Jospin]] administration criticizes the use of ''ordonnances'' and article 49-3 in 1995 by [[Alain Juppé]], particularly to force a reform of Social Security without the intervention of Parliament, resulting in [[1995 strikes in France|mass strikes]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous usage==
''Ordonnances'' have been extensively used as a form of [[rule by decree]] in periods where the government operated without a working Parliament: [[Vichy France]], where the executive had dismissed Parliament and other [[democracy|democratic]] structures, the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], until it could establish a legislature, and in the last days of the [[French Fourth Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=19580604&amp;numTexte=&amp;pageDebut=05327&amp;pageFin= Loi n°58-520 du 3 juin 1958 relative aux pleins pouvoirs]&lt;/ref&gt; and the early days of the [[French Fifth Republic]], until the new constitution had come into force and legislative elections had been held (article 92 of the Constitution, now repealed).

Certain legal texts enacted by the King in the medieval and ''[[Ancien Régime in France|ancien régime]]'' eras were called ''ordonnances'', the best known of which today is the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]].

A '''pension''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛ|n|ʃ|ə|n}}, from [[Latin]] ''pensiō'', "payment") is a fund into which a sum of money is added during an employee's employment years, and from which payments are drawn to support the person's [[retirement]] from work in the form of periodic payments. A pension may be a "defined benefit plan" where a fixed sum is paid regularly to a person, or a "defined contribution plan" under which a fixed sum is invested and then becomes available at retirement age.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas P. Lemke|first1=Gerald T. Lins|title=ERISA for Money Managers|date=2010|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|isbn=9780314627056|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/ERISA_for_Money_Managers.html?id=af-_YgEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pensions should not be confused with [[Severance package|severance pay]]; the former is usually paid in regular installments for life after retirement, while the latter is typically paid as a fixed amount after involuntary termination of employment prior to retirement.

The terms "retirement plan" and "superannuation" tend to refer to a pension granted upon retirement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=superannuation|title=WordNet Search - 3.1|work=princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retirement plans may be set up by employers, insurance companies, the government or other institutions such as employer associations or trade unions. Called ''retirement plans'' in the [[United States]], they are commonly known as ''pension schemes'' in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] and ''superannuation plans'' (or ''super''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrysuper.com/ |title=Industry SuperFunds - Home |publisher=industrysuper.com |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Superannuation in Australia|Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Retirement pensions are typically in the form of a guaranteed [[life annuity]], thus insuring against the [[Longevity risk|risk of longevity]].

A pension created by an employer for the benefit of an employee is commonly referred to as an occupational or employer pension.  [[Labor union]]s, the government, or other organizations may also fund pensions. Occupational pensions are a form of [[deferred compensation]], usually advantageous to employee and employer for [[tax]] reasons. Many pensions also contain an additional [[insurance]] aspect, since they often will pay benefits to survivors or disabled beneficiaries. Other vehicles (certain [[lottery]] payouts, for example, or an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]]) may provide a similar stream of payments.

The common use of the term ''pension'' is to describe the payments a person receives upon retirement, usually under pre-determined legal or contractual terms. A recipient of a retirement pension is known as a ''[[pensioner]]'' or ''retiree''.

==Types of pensions==

===Employment-based pensions===
A retirement plan is an arrangement to provide people with an income during retirement when they are no longer earning a steady income from employment. Often retirement plans require both the employer and employee to contribute money to a fund during their employment in order to receive defined benefits upon retirement.  It is a tax deferred savings vehicle that allows for the tax-free accumulation of a fund for later use as a retirement income.  Funding can be provided in other ways, such as from labor unions, government agencies, or self-funded schemes. Pension plans are therefore a form of "deferred compensation". A [[Small Self Administered Scheme|SSAS]] is a type of employment-based Pension in the UK.

Some countries also grant pensions to military veterans. Military pensions are overseen by the government; an example of a standing agency is the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]. ''[[Ad hoc]]'' committees may also be formed to investigate specific tasks, such as the U.S. [[Commission on Veterans' Pensions]] (commonly known as the "Bradley Commission") in 1955–56.  Pensions may extend past the death of the veteran himself, continuing to be paid to the widow; see, for example, the case of [[Esther Sumner Damon]], who was the last surviving [[American Revolution|American Revolutionary War]] widow at her death in 1906.

In early 2017, the [[Wall Street Journal]] reported the percentage of American private-sector workers who have a traditional pension is 13%, down from 38% in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Timothy W. |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-champions-of-the-401-k-lament-the-revolution-they-started-1483382348 |title=The Champions of the 401(k) Lament the Revolution They Started |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=2017-01-02 |accessdate=2017-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|State pension}}&lt;!-- [[State pension]] redirects here--&gt;Social and state pensions===
Many countries have created funds for their citizens and residents to provide income when they retire (or in some cases become disabled). Typically this requires payments throughout the citizen's working life in order to qualify for benefits later on. A basic state pension is a "contribution based" benefit, and depends on an individual's contribution history. For examples, see [[National Insurance]] in the UK, or [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] in the United States of America.

Many countries have also put in place a "[[social pension]]". These are regular, tax-funded non-contributory cash transfers paid to older people. Over 80 countries have social pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pension-watch.net/country-fact-file/|title=Country map|work=pension-watch.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are universal benefits, given to all older people regardless of income, assets or employment record. Examples of universal pensions include [[New Zealand]] Superannuation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/a-z-benefits/nz-superannuation.html|title=New Zealand Superannuation|author=webcoordinator@msd.govt.nz|work=workandincome.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Basic Retirement Pension of [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Larry |last=Willmore|title=Universal Pensions in Mauritius|date=April 2003|ssrn=398280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most social pensions, though, are means-tested, such as [[Supplemental Security Income]] in the United States of America or the "older person's grant" in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old age pension|url=http://www.services.gov.za/services/content/Home/ServicesForPeople/Socialbenefits/oldagegrant/en_ZA|publisher=GCIS|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability pensions===
{{Main|Disability pension}}
Some pension plans will provide for members in the event they suffer a [[disability]].  This may take the form of early entry into a retirement plan for a disabled member below the normal retirement age.

==Benefits==
Retirement plans may be classified as ''defined benefit'' or ''defined contribution'' according to how the benefits are determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/0/49/38356329.pdf |title=Private Pensions/Les pensions privées |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A defined benefit plan guarantees a certain payout at retirement, according to a fixed formula which usually depends on the member's salary and the number of years' membership in the plan.  A defined contribution plan will provide a payout at retirement that is dependent upon the amount of money contributed and the performance of the investment vehicles utilized. Hence, with a defined contribution plan the risk and responsibility lies with the employee that the funding will be sufficient through retirement, whereas with the defined benefit plan the risk and responsibility lies with the employer or plan managers.

Some types of retirement plans, such as ''cash balance'' plans, combine features of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.  They are often referred to as ''hybrid'' plans. Such plan designs have become increasingly popular in the US since the 1990s.  Examples include Cash Balance and Pension Equity plans.

===Defined benefit plans===
{{Main|Defined benefit pension plan}}
A traditional defined benefit (DB) plan is a plan in which the benefit on retirement is determined by a set formula, rather than depending on investment returns. Government pensions such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] in the United States are a type of defined benefit pension plan. Traditionally, defined benefit plans for employers have been administered by institutions which exist specifically for that purpose, by large businesses, or, for [[government]] workers, by the government itself. A traditional form of defined benefit plan is the ''final salary'' plan, under which the pension paid is equal to the number of years worked, multiplied by the member's salary at retirement, multiplied by a factor known as the ''accrual rate''. The final accrued amount is available as a monthly pension or a lump sum, but usually monthly.

The benefit in a defined benefit pension plan is determined by a formula that can incorporate the employee's pay, years of employment, age at retirement, and other factors. A simple example is a Dollars Times Service plan design that provides a certain amount per month based on the time an employee works for a company. For example, a plan offering $100 a month per year of service would provide $3,000 per month to a retiree with 30 years of service. While this type of plan is popular among unionized workers, Final Average Pay (FAP) remains the most common type of defined benefit plan offered in the United States. In FAP plans, the average salary over the final years of an employee's career determines the benefit amount.

Averaging salary over a number of years means that the calculation is averaging different dollars. For example, if salary is averaged over five years, and retirement is in 2009, then salary in 2004 dollars is averaged with salary in 2005 dollars, etc., with 2004 dollars being worth more than the dollars of succeeding years. The pension is then paid in first year of retirement dollars, in this example 2009 dollars, with the lowest value of any dollars in the calculation. Thus inflation in the salary averaging years has a considerable impact on purchasing power and cost, both being reduced equally by inflation

This effect of inflation can be eliminated by converting salaries in the averaging years to first year of retirement dollars, and then averaging.

In the US, {{uscsub|26|414|j}} specifies a defined benefit plan to be any pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan (see below) where a defined contribution plan is any plan with individual accounts. A traditional pension plan that ''defines'' a ''benefit'' for an employee upon that employee's retirement is a defined benefit plan.  In the U.S., corporate defined benefit plans, along with many other types of defined benefit plans, are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''ERISA for Money Managers'', §1:2 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], benefits are typically indexed for inflation (known as [[Retail Prices Index (United Kingdom)|Retail Prices Index]] (RPI)) as required by law for registered pension plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/Pension_Rights/Pension_Increases/ |title=The Pensions Advisory Service |publisher=The Pensions Advisory Service |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inflation during an employee's retirement affects the purchasing power of the pension; the higher the inflation rate, the lower the purchasing power of a fixed annual pension. This effect can be mitigated by providing annual increases to the pension at the rate of inflation (usually capped, for instance at 5% in any given year). This method is advantageous for the employee since it stabilizes the purchasing power of pensions to some extent.

If the pension plan allows for early retirement, payments are often reduced to recognize that the [[retiree]]s will receive the payouts for longer periods of time. In the United States, under the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act|Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]], any reduction factor less than or equal to the [[actuarial]] early retirement reduction factor is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Retirement Provisions in Defined Benefit Pension Plans|first=Ann C.|last=Foster|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/cwc/archive/winter1996art3.pdf|format=PDF|website=bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many DB plans include early retirement provisions to encourage employees to retire early, before the attainment of normal retirement age (usually age 65). Companies would rather hire younger employees at lower wages. Some of those provisions come in the form of additional ''temporary'' or ''supplemental benefits'', which are payable to a certain age, usually before attaining normal retirement age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Qualified Domestic Relations Order Handbook|first=Gary A.|last=Shulman''|pages=199–200|publisher=Aspen Publishers Online|year=1999|ISBN=978-0-7355-0665-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funding====
{{Main|Defined benefit pension plan#Funding}}
Defined benefit plans may be either ''funded'' or ''unfunded''.

In an ''unfunded'' defined benefit pension, no assets are set aside and the benefits are paid for by the employer or other pension sponsor as and when they are paid. Pension arrangements provided by the state in most countries in the world are unfunded, with benefits paid directly from current workers' contributions and taxes.  This method of financing is known as ''pay-as-you-go''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=5310|title=Unfunded Pension Plans|work= [[OECD]] Glossary of Statistical Terms|accessdate=26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social security systems of many European countries are unfunded,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/18502013 "Falling Short"] ''The Economist'' April 7, 2011. Retrieved 30 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; having benefits paid directly out of current taxes and social security contributions, although several countries have hybrid systems which are partially funded. Spain set up the Social Security Reserve Fund and France set up the [[Pensions Reserve Fund (France)|Pensions Reserve Fund]]; in Canada the [[Canada Pension Plan|wage-based retirement plan]] (CPP) is partially funded, with assets managed by the [[CPP Investment Board]] while the U.S. [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system is partially funded by investment in special U.S. Treasury Bonds.

In a ''funded'' plan, contributions from the employer, and sometimes also from plan members, are invested in a fund towards meeting the benefits.  All plans must be funded in some way, even if they are pay-as-you-go, so this type of plan is more accurately known as ''pre-funded''.  The future returns on the investments, and the future benefits to be paid, are not known in advance, so there is no guarantee that a given level of contributions will be enough to meet the benefits.  Typically, the contributions to be paid are regularly reviewed in a valuation of the plan's assets and liabilities, carried out by an [[actuary]] to ensure that the pension fund will meet future payment obligations.  This means that in a defined benefit pension, investment risk and investment rewards are typically assumed by the sponsor/employer and not by the individual.  If a plan is not well-funded, the plan sponsor may not have the financial resources to continue funding the plan.

====Criticisms====
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
Traditional defined benefit plan designs (because of their typically flat accrual rate and the decreasing time for interest discounting as people get closer to retirement age) tend to exhibit a J-shaped accrual pattern of benefits, where the present value of benefits grows quite slowly early in an employee's career and accelerates significantly in mid-career: in other words it costs more to fund the pension for older employees than for younger ones (an "age bias"). Defined benefit pensions tend to be less [[Portability (social security)|portable]] than defined contribution plans, even if the plan allows a lump sum cash benefit at termination. Most plans, however, pay their benefits as an annuity, so retirees do not bear the risk of low investment returns on contributions or of outliving their retirement income. The open-ended nature of these risks to the employer is the reason given by many employers for switching from defined benefit to defined contribution plans over recent years. The risks to the employer can sometimes be mitigated by discretionary elements in the benefit structure, for instance in the rate of increase granted on accrued pensions, both before and after retirement.

The age bias, reduced [[Portability (social security)|portability]] and open ended risk make defined benefit plans better suited to large employers with less mobile workforces, such as the public sector (which has open-ended support from taxpayers). This coupled with a lack of foresight on the employers part means a large proportion of the workforce are kept in the dark over future investment schemes.

Defined benefit plans are sometimes criticized as being paternalistic as they enable employers or plan trustees to make decisions about the type of benefits and family structures and lifestyles of their employees. However they are typically more valuable than defined contribution plans in most circumstances and for most employees (mainly because the employer tends to pay higher contributions than under defined contribution plans), so such criticism is rarely harsh.

The "cost" of a defined benefit plan is not easily calculated, and requires an actuary or actuarial software. However, even with the best of tools, the cost of a defined benefit plan will always be an estimate based on economic and financial assumptions. These assumptions include the average retirement age and lifespan of the employees, the returns to be earned by the pension plan's investments and any additional taxes or levies, such as those required by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in the U.S. So, for this arrangement, the benefit is relatively secure but the contribution is uncertain even when estimated by a professional.  This has serious cost considerations and risks for the employer offering a pension plan.

One of the growing concerns with defined benefit plans is that the level of future obligations will outpace the value of assets held by the plan.  This "underfunding" dilemma can be faced by any type of defined benefit plan, private or public, but it is most acute in governmental and other public plans where political pressures and less rigorous accounting standards can result in excessive commitments to employees and retirees, but inadequate contributions.  Many states and municipalities across the United States of America and Canada now face chronic pension crises.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =Tufts| first =William| last2 =Fairbanks| first2 =Lee| title =Pension Ponzi: How Public-sector Unions are Bankrupting Canada's Health Care, Education and Your Retirement| place =Mississauga, Ontario| publisher =Wiley| year =2011| pages =210| url =http://fairpensionsforall.net/book/| isbn =978-1118098738}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Examples====
Many countries offer state-sponsored retirement benefits, beyond those provided by employers, which are funded by [[payroll tax|payroll]] or other taxes. In the United States, the Social Security system is similar in function to a defined benefit pension arrangement, albeit one that is constructed differently from a pension offered by a private employer; however, Social Security is distinct in that there is no legally guaranteed level of benefits derived from the amount paid into the program.

Individuals that have worked in the UK and have paid certain levels of national insurance deductions can expect an income from the state pension scheme after their normal retirement. The state pension is currently divided into two parts: the basic state pension, State Second [tier] Pension scheme called S2P. Individuals will qualify for the basic state pension if they have completed sufficient years contribution to their national insurance record.  The S2P pension scheme is earnings related and depends on earnings in each year as to how much an individual can expect to receive. It is possible for an individual to forgo the S2P payment from the state, in lieu of a payment made to an appropriate pension scheme of their choice, during their working life.  For more details see [[UK pension provision]].

===Defined contribution plans===
{{Main|Defined contribution plan}}
In a defined contribution plan, contributions are paid into an individual account for each member. The contributions are invested, for example in the stock market, and the returns on the investment (which may be positive or negative) are credited to the individual's account.  On retirement, the member's account is used to provide retirement benefits, sometimes through the purchase of an annuity which then provides a regular income.  Defined contribution plans have become widespread all over the world in recent years, and are now the dominant form of plan in the private sector in many countries.  For example, the number of defined benefit plans in the US has been steadily declining, as more and more employers see pension contributions as a large expense avoidable by disbanding the defined benefit plan and instead offering a defined contribution plan.

Money contributed can either be from employee salary deferral or from employer contributions. The [[Portability (social security)|portability]] of defined contribution pensions is legally no different from the [[Portability (social security)|portability]] of defined benefit plans.  However, because of the cost of administration and ease of determining the plan sponsor's liability for defined contribution plans (you do not need to pay an actuary to calculate the lump sum equivalent that you do for defined benefit plans) in practice, defined contribution plans have become generally [[Portability (social security)|portable]].

In a defined contribution plan, investment risk and investment rewards are assumed by each individual/employee/retiree and not by the sponsor/employer, and these risks may be substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Edmund|author2=Ian Tonks|title=The Value and Risk of Defined Contribution Pension Schemes: International Evidence|journal=Journal of Risk and Insurance|year=2012|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6975.2011.01456.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1539-6975.2011.01456.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, participants do not necessarily purchase annuities with their savings upon retirement, and bear the risk of outliving their assets. (In the United Kingdom, for instance, it is a legal requirement to use the bulk of the fund to purchase an annuity.)

The "cost" of a defined contribution plan is readily calculated,  but the benefit from a defined contribution plan depends upon the account balance at the time an employee is looking to use the assets.  So, for this arrangement, the ''contribution is known'' but the ''benefit is unknown'' (until calculated).

Despite the fact that the participant in a defined contribution plan typically has control over investment decisions, the plan sponsor retains a significant degree of fiduciary responsibility over investment of plan assets, including the selection of investment options and administrative providers.

A defined contribution plan typically involves a number of service providers, including in many cases:
* Trustee
* Custodian
* Administrator
* Recordkeeper
* Auditor
* Legal counsel&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''ERISA for Money Managers'' §2:26 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
In the United States, the legal definition of a defined contribution plan is  a plan providing for an individual account for each participant, and for benefits based solely on the amount contributed to the account, plus or minus income, gains, expenses and losses allocated to the account (see {{uscsub|26|414|i}}). Examples of defined contribution plans in the United States include [[individual retirement account]]s (IRAs) and [[401(k)|401(k) plans]]. In such plans, the employee is responsible, to one degree or another, for selecting the types of [[investment]]s toward which the funds in the retirement plan are allocated.  This may range from choosing one of a small number of pre-determined [[mutual fund]]s to selecting individual [[stock]]s or other [[security (finance)|securities]].  Most self-directed retirement plans are characterized by certain [[tax advantage]]s, and some provide for a portion of the employee's contributions to be matched by the employer.  In exchange, the funds in such plans may not be withdrawn by the investor prior to reaching a certain age—typically the year the employee reaches 59.5 years old-- (with a small number of exceptions) without incurring a substantial penalty.

In the US, defined contribution plans are subject to [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] limits on how much can be contributed, known as the section 415 limit.  In 2009, the total deferral amount, including employee contribution plus employer contribution, was limited to $49,000 or 100% of compensation, whichever is less.  The employee-only limit in 2009 was $16,500 with a $5,500 catch-up. These numbers usually increase each year and are indexed to compensate for the effects of inflation.  For 2015, the limits were raised to $53,000 and $18,000,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Announces-2015-Pension-Plan-Limitations;-Taxpayers-May-Contribute-up-to-$18,000-to-their-401(k)-plans-in-2015 IRS Announces 2015 Pension Plan Limitations; Taxpayers May Contribute up to $18,000 to their 401(k) plans in 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

Examples of defined contribution pension schemes in other countries are, the UK's personal pensions and proposed National Employment Savings Trust (NEST), Germany's Riester plans, Australia's Superannuation system and New Zealand's KiwiSaver scheme. Individual pension savings plans also exist in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Economic Policy Committee and the European Commission|title=The impact of ageing on public expenditure|year=2006|publisher=EU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid and cash balance plans===
Hybrid plan designs combine the features of defined benefit and defined contribution plan designs.

A [[cash balance plan]] is a defined benefit plan made to appear as if it were a defined contribution plan.  They have ''notional balances'' in hypothetical accounts where, typically, each year the plan administrator will contribute an amount equal to a certain percentage of each participant's salary; a second contribution, called ''interest credit'', is made as well.  These are not actual contributions and further discussion is beyond the scope of this entry suffice it to say that there is currently much controversy.
In general, they are usually treated as [[defined benefit plan]]s for tax, accounting and regulatory purposes. As with defined benefit plans, investment risk in hybrid designs is largely borne by the plan sponsor. As with defined contribution designs, plan benefits are expressed in the terms of a notional ''account balance,'' and are usually paid as cash balances upon termination of employment. These features make them more [[Portability (social security)|portable]] than traditional defined benefit plans and perhaps more attractive to a more highly mobile workforce.

[[Target benefit plan]]s are defined contribution plans made to match (or resemble) defined benefit plans.

===Contrasting types of retirement plans===
Advocates of defined contribution plans point out that each employee has the ability to tailor the investment portfolio to his or her individual needs and financial situation, including the choice of how much to contribute, if anything at all.  However, others state that these apparent advantages could also hinder some workers who might not possess the financial savvy to choose the correct investment vehicles or have the discipline to voluntarily contribute money to retirement accounts.  This debate parallels the discussion currently going on in the U.S., where many [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] leaders favor transforming the Social Security system, at least in part, to a self-directed investment plan.

Defined contribution pensions, by definition, are funded, as the "guarantee" made to employees is that specified (defined) contributions will be made during an individual's working life.

There are many ways to finance a pension and save for retirement. Pension plans can be set up by an employer, matching a monetary contribution each month, by the state or personally through a pension scheme with a financial institution, such as a bank or brokerage firm. Pension plans often come with a tax break depending on the country and plan type.

For example, Canadians have the option to open a [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan]] (RRSP), as well as a range of employee and state pension programs.  This plan allows contributions to this account to be marked as un-taxable income and remain un-taxed until withdrawal. Most countries' governments will provide advice on pension schemes.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Widows' funds were among the first pension type arrangement to appear, for example [[Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha|Duke Ernest the Pious]] of [[Gotha]] in Germany, founded a widows' fund for clergy in 1645 and another for teachers in 1662.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haberman|first=Steven|title=History of Actuarial Science, vol. 1|year=1995|publisher=William Pickering|location=London|isbn=1-85196-160-7|pages=xlviii|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/468359649}}&lt;/ref&gt;   'Various schemes of provision for ministers' widows were then established throughout Europe at about the start of the eighteenth century, some based on a single premium others based on yearly premiums to be distributed as benefits in the same year.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hald|first=A.|title=A History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications Before 1750|year=1990|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-50230-2|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19629739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
{{Main|Pensions in Germany}}
As part of archduke [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s social legislation, the [[State Socialism (Germany)#Old Age and Disability Insurance Bill of 1889|Old Age and Disability Insurance Bill]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gianasso|first1=Alexandre|title=A Brief History of Pensions|url=http://www.damgoodpensions.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-pensions/|website=Davidson Asset Management|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Old Age Pension program, financed by a tax on workers, was originally designed to provide a pension annuity for workers who reached the age of 70 years, though this was lowered to 65 years in 1916. It is sometimes claimed that at the time [[life expectancy]] for the average Prussian was 45 years; in fact this figure ignores the very high infant mortality and high maternal death rate from childbirth of this era.
In fact, an adult entering into insurance under the scheme would on average live to 70 years of age, a figure used in the actuarial assumptions included in the legislation.

===Ireland===
There is a history of pensions in [[Ireland]] that can be traced back to [[Brehon Law]] imposing a legal responsibility on the kin group to take care of its members who were aged, blind, deaf, sick or insane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lynn|first1=Theodore G.|last2=Clarke|first2=Blanaid J.|title=The Irish Corporate Governance System|journal=|date=19 August 2010|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1661617|ssrn=1661617}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion on pension funds and early Irish law, see F Kelly, ''A Guide to Early Irish Law'' (Dublin, [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]], 1988). In 2010, there were over 76,291 pension schemes operating in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pensions Board Annual Report|year=2010|url=http://www.pensionsboard.ie/en/Publications/Annual_Report/|website=pensionsboard.ie|access-date=15 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105051147/http://www.pensionsboard.ie/en/Publications/Annual_Report/|archive-date=5 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the [[Republic of Ireland]] has a two-tiered approach to the provision of pensions or retirement benefits. First, there is a state social welfare retirement pension, which promises a basic level of pension. This is a flat rate pension, funded by the national social insurance system and is termed [[Pay Related Social Insurance]] or PRSI. Secondly, there are the occupational pension schemes and self-employed arrangements, which supplement the state pension.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Pensions in the United Kingdom}}
{{See also|English Poor Laws|Timeline of pensions in the United Kingdom}}
Until the 20th century, poverty was seen as a quasi-criminal state, and this was reflected in the [[Vagabonds and Beggars Act 1495]] that imprisoned beggars. During Elizabethan and Victorian times, [[English poor laws]] represented a shift whereby the poor were seen merely as morally degenerate, and were expected to perform forced labour in [[workhouse]]s.

The beginning of the modern state pension was the [[Old Age Pensions Act 1908]], that provided 5 shillings (£0.25) a week for those over 70 whose annual means do not exceed £31.50. It coincided with the [[Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09]] and was the first step in the [[Liberal welfare reforms]] to the completion of a system of social security, with unemployment and health insurance through the [[National Insurance Act 1911]].

After the Second World War, the [[National Insurance Act 1946]] completed universal coverage of social security. The [[National Assistance Act 1948]] formally abolished the poor law, and gave a minimum income to those not paying national insurance.

The early 1990s established the existing framework for state pensions in the [[Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992]] and [[Superannuation and other Funds (Validation) Act 1992]]. Following the highly respected [[Goode Report]], occupational pensions were covered by comprehensive statutes in the [[Pension Schemes Act 1993]] and the [[Pensions Act 1995]].

In 2002 the [[Pensions Commission]] was established as a cross party body to review pensions in the United Kingdom. The first Act to follow was the [[Pensions Act 2004]] that updated regulation by replacing OPRA with the [[Pensions Regulator]] and relaxing the stringency of minimum funding requirements for pensions, while ensuring protection for insolvent businesses. In a major update of the state pension, the [[Pensions Act 2007]], which aligned and raised retirement ages. Following that, the [[Pensions Act 2008]] has set up automatic enrolment for [[occupational pensions]], and a public competitor designed to be a low-cost and efficient fund manager, called the [[National Employment Savings Trust]] (or "Nest").

===United States===
Public pensions got their start with various 'promises', informal and legislated, made to veterans of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and, more extensively, the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  They were expanded greatly, and began to be offered by a number of state and local governments during the early [[Progressive Era]] in the late nineteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Federal civilian pensions were offered under the [[Civil Service Retirement System]] (CSRS), formed in 1920.  CSRS provided retirement, disability and survivor benefits for most civilian employees in the US Federal government, until the creation of a new Federal agency, the [[Federal Employees Retirement System]] (FERS), in 1987.

Pension plans became popular in the United States during [[World War II]], when wage freezes prohibited outright increases in workers' pay. The defined benefit plan had been the most popular and common type of [[Retirement plans in the United States|retirement plan in the United States]] through the 1980s; since that time, defined contribution plans have become the more common type of retirement plan in the United States and many other western countries.

In April 2012, the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] Retirement Fund filed for [[Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]] protection.  The retirement fund is a [[defined benefit]] type pension plan and was only partially funded by the government, with only $268.4 million in [[asset]]s and $911 million in [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]].  The plan experienced low investment returns and a benefit structure that had been increased without raises in funding.&lt;ref name=p&amp;i20120419&gt;
{{cite news|last=Mercado|first=Darla|title=In apparent first, a public pension plan files for bankruptcy|url=http://www.pionline.com/article/20120419/REG/120419842/in-apparent-first-a-public-pension-plan-files-for-bankruptcy|accessdate=2012-04-28|newspaper=Pensions and Investments|date=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to ''Pensions and Investments'', this is "apparently the first" US public pension plan to declare bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=p&amp;i20120419/&gt;

==Current challenges==
A growing challenge for many nations is [[population ageing]].  As birth rates drop and life expectancy increases an ever-larger portion of the population is elderly. This leaves fewer workers for each retired person.  In many developed countries this means that government and [[public sector]] pensions could potentially be a drag on their economies unless pension systems are reformed or taxes are increased.  One method of reforming the pension system is to increase the retirement age.  Two exceptions are [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], where the pension system is forecast to be [[Solvency|solvent]] for the foreseeable future. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}  In Canada, for instance, the annual payments were increased by some 70% in 1998 to achieve this.  These two nations also have an advantage from their relative openness to immigration: immigrants tend to be of working age. However, their populations are not growing as fast as the U.S., which supplements a high immigration rate with one of the highest birthrates among Western countries. Thus, the population in the U.S. is not ageing to the extent as those in Europe, Australia, or Canada.

Another growing challenge is the recent trend of states and businesses in the United States purposely under-funding their pension schemes in order to push the costs onto the federal government. For example, in 2009, the majority of states have unfunded pension liabilities exceeding all reported state debt. [[Bradley Belt]], former executive director of the PBGC (the [[Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation]], the federal agency that insures private-sector defined-benefit pension plans in the event of bankruptcy), testified before a Congressional hearing in October 2004, "I am particularly concerned with the temptation, and indeed, growing tendency, to use the pension insurance fund as a means to obtain an interest-free and risk-free loan to enable companies to restructure. Unfortunately, the current calculation appears to be that shifting pension liabilities onto other premium payers or potentially taxpayers is the path of least resistance rather than a last resort."

Challenges have further been increased by the post-2007 credit crunch. Total funding of the nation's 100 largest corporate pension plans fell by $303bn in 2008, going from a $86bn surplus at the end of 2007 to a $217bn deficit at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Largest U.S. pension plans assets fall $217 billion short|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/retirement/2009-03-11-pension-plan-assets-short_N.htm|newspaper=USA Today, citing a report by Watson Wyatt|date=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political corruption sidebar}}

'''Political corruption''' is the use of powers by government officials or their network contacts for illegitimate private gain. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties, is done under [[color of law]] or involves [[Influence peddling|trading in influence]].

Forms of [[corruption]] vary, but include [[bribery]], [[extortion]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], [[parochialism]], [[patronage]], [[influence peddling]], [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and [[embezzlement]]. Corruption may facilitate [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]] such as [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking]], though is not restricted to these activities. Misuse of [[government]] power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general [[police brutality]], is also considered political corruption. [[Corruption in Lithuania#Examples post-2016|Masiulis case]] is a typical example of political corruption.

The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, some political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or ill-defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.
Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title=African corruption 'on the wane'|date=10 July 2007|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning "rule by thieves".

Some forms of corruption – now called "institutional corruption"&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis. ''Ethics in Congress: From Individual to Institutional Corruption'' (Washington DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1995).  {{ISBN|0-8157-8423-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; – are distinguished from bribery and other kinds of obvious personal gain.  A similar problem of corruption arises in any institution that depends on financial support from people who have interests that may conflict with the primary purpose of the institution.

Over time, corruption has been defined differently. For example, in a simple context, while performing work for a government or as a representative, it is unethical to accept a gift. Any free gift could be construed as a scheme to lure the recipient towards some biases. In most cases, the gift is seen as an intention to seek certain favors such as work promotion, tipping in order to win a contract, job or exemption from certain tasks in the case of junior employee giving the gift to a senior employee who can be key in winning the favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanzi|first=Vito|date=1998-12-01|title=Corruption Around the World: Causes, Consequences, Scope, and Cures|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.2307/3867585|journal=Staff Papers|language=en|volume=45|issue=4|pages=559–594|doi=10.2307/3867585|issn=0020-8027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
===Effects on politics, administration, and institutions===
In politics, corruption undermines democracy and [[good governance]] by flouting or even subverting formal processes. Corruption in elections and in the legislature reduces accountability and distorts representation in policymaking; corruption in the judiciary compromises the [[rule of law]]; and corruption in [[public administration]] results in the inefficient provision of services.  It violates a basic principle of [[republicanism]] regarding the centrality of civic virtue.&lt;ref name="www-wds.worldbank"/&gt;

More generally, corruption erodes the institutional capacity of government if procedures are disregarded, resources are siphoned off, and public offices are bought and sold. Corruption undermines the legitimacy of government and such democratic values as trust and tolerance. Recent evidence suggests that variation in the levels of corruption amongst high-income democracies can vary significantly depending on the level of accountability of decision-makers.&lt;ref name="www-wds.worldbank"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first= Alexander |year=2013 |title= Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf |format=PDF |publisher= World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from [[fragile state]]s also shows that corruption and bribery can adversely impact trust in institutions.&lt;ref name="bath.ac.uk"&gt;Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J. (2014) The Tribes that Bind: Attitudes to the Tribe and Tribal Leader in the Sudan. Bath Economic Research Papers 31/14. [http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/31-14.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, A 2014"&gt;Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J. (2014) Bribery and Identity: Evidence from Sudan. Bath Economic Research Papers 30/14.[http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/30-14.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption can also impact government’s provision of goods and services. It increases the costs of goods and services which arise efficiency loss. In the absence of corruption, governmental projects might be cost-effective at their true costs, however, once corruption costs are included projects may not be cost-effective so they are not executed distorting the provision of goods and services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Economic effects===
{{see also|Economics of corruption|Corporate crime}}
In the [[private sector]], corruption increases the cost of business through the price of illicit payments themselves, the management cost of negotiating with officials and the risk of breached agreements or detection. Although some claim corruption reduces costs by cutting [[bureaucracy]], the availability of bribes can also induce officials to contrive new rules and delays. Openly removing costly and lengthy regulations are better than covertly allowing them to be bypassed by using bribes. Where corruption inflates the cost of business, it also distorts the field of inquiry and action, shielding firms with connections from competition and thereby sustaining inefficient firms.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros, [http://54pesos.org/2008/11/15/corruption-and-development-does-the-%E2%80%9Crule-of-law%E2%80%9D-factor-weigh-more-than-we-think "Corruption and development. Does the "rule of law" factor weigh more than we think?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102095104/http://54pesos.org/2008/11/15/corruption-and-development-does-the-%E2%80%9Crule-of-law%E2%80%9D-factor-weigh-more-than-we-think |date=2016-01-02 }} 54 Pesos (November 15, 2008).

Corruption may have a direct impact on the firm's effective marginal tax rate. Bribing tax officials can reduce tax payments of the firm if the marginal bribe rate is below the official marginal tax rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in Uganda, bribes have a higher negative impact on firms’ activity than taxation. Indeed, a one percentage point increase in bribes reduces firm’s annual growth by three percentage points, while an increase in 1 percentage point on taxes reduces firm’s growth by one percentage point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisman|first=Raymond|last2=Svensson|first2=Jakob|date=2007|title=Are corruption and taxation really harmful to growth? Firm level evidence|url=|journal=Journal of Development Economics|volume=83|issue=1|pages=63–75|doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2005.09.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption also generates economic distortion in the [[public sector]] by diverting public investment into capital projects where bribes and [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] are more plentiful. Officials may increase the technical complexity of public sector projects to conceal or pave the way for such dealings, thus further distorting investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uneca.org/aec/documents/Mina%20Baliamoune-Lutz_%20Leonce%20Ndikumana.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309123826/http://www.uneca.org/aec/documents/Mina%20Baliamoune-Lutz_%20Leonce%20Ndikumana.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-09 |title=Corruption and growth in African countries: Exploring the investment channel, lead author Mina Baliamoune-Lutz, Department of Economics |publisher=University of North Florida |page=1,2 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption also lowers compliance with construction, environmental, or other regulations, reduces the quality of government services and infrastructure, and increases budgetary pressures on government.

Economists argue that one of the factors behind the differing [[economic development]] in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] is that in Africa, corruption has primarily taken the form of [[rent seeking|rent extraction]] with the resulting [[financial capital]] moved overseas rather than invested at home (hence the stereotypical, but often accurate, image of African dictators having [[Swiss bank|Swiss bank accounts]]). In [[Nigeria]], for example, more than $400 billion was stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/nigerias-corruption-busters.html |title=Nigeria's corruption busters |publisher=Unodc.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] researchers estimated that from 1970 to 1996, [[capital flight]] from 30 [[Sub-Saharan]] countries totaled $187bn, exceeding those nations' external debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/Economy/200503140015 |title=When the money goes west |publisher=New Statesman |date=2005-03-14 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706191351/http://www.newstatesman.com/Economy/200503140015 |archivedate=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The results, expressed in retarded or suppressed development, have been modeled in theory by economist [[Mancur Olson]].) In the case of Africa, one of the factors for this behavior was political instability and the fact that new governments often confiscated previous government's corruptly obtained assets. This encouraged officials to stash their wealth abroad, out of reach of any future [[Nationalization|expropriation]]. In contrast, Asian administrations such as [[Suharto]]'s [[Orde Baru|New Order]] often took a cut on business transactions or provided conditions for development, through infrastructure investment, law and order, etc.

===Environmental and social effects===
{{further|Human impact on the environment}}
[[File:Corrupt-Legislation-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|Detail from ''Corrupt Legislation'' (1896) by [[Elihu Vedder]]. Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]
Corruption is often most evident in countries with the smallest per capita incomes, relying on foreign aid for health services. Local political interception of donated money from overseas is especially prevalent in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n nations, where it was reported in the 2006 [[World Bank|World Bank Report]] that about half of the funds that were donated for health usages were never invested into the health sectors or given to those needing medical attention.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=10.2307/20032209|title=The Challenge of Global Health on JSTOR|publisher=|doi=10.2307/20032209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the donated money was expended through "[[Counterfeit medications|counterfeit drugs]], siphoning off of drugs to the black market, and payments to ghost employees". Ultimately, there is a sufficient amount of money for health in developing countries, but local corruption denies the wider citizenry the resource they require.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Corruption facilitates environmental destruction. While corrupt societies may have formal legislation to protect the environment, it cannot be enforced if officials can easily be bribed. The same applies to social rights worker protection, [[Trade union|unionization]] prevention, and [[child labor]]. Violation of these laws rights enables corrupt countries to gain illegitimate economic advantage in the international market.

The [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Amartya Sen]] has observed that "there is no such thing as an apolitical food problem." While drought and other naturally occurring events may trigger [[famine]] conditions, it is government action or inaction that determines its severity, and often even whether or not a famine will occur.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/08/15/wipro-tata-corruption-ent-law-cx_kw_0814whartonindia.html|title=Will Growth Slow Corruption In India?|publisher=Forbes | date=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments with strong tendencies towards [[kleptocracy]] can undermine [[food security]] even when harvests are good. Officials often steal state property. In [[Bihar]], [[India]], more than 80% of the subsidized food aid to poor is stolen by corrupt officials.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; Similarly, food aid is often robbed at gunpoint by governments, criminals, and warlords alike, and sold for a profit. The 20th century is full of many examples of governments undermining the food security of their own nations – sometimes intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheeter |first=Laura |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7111296.stm |title=Ukraine remembers famine horror |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-11-24 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on humanitarian aid===
The scale of [[humanitarian aid]] to the poor and unstable regions of the world grows, but it is highly [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] to corruption, with food aid, construction and other highly valued assistance as the most at risk.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Sarah Bailey (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2385&amp;title=corruption-risks-perceptions-prevention-humanitarian-assistance Need and greed: corruption risks, perceptions and prevention in humanitarian assistance] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Food aid can be directly and physically diverted from its intended destination, or indirectly through the manipulation of assessments, targeting, registration and distributions to favor certain groups or individuals.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

In construction and shelter there are numerous opportunities for diversion and profit through substandard workmanship, kickbacks for contracts and favouritism in the provision of valuable shelter material.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Thus while humanitarian aid agencies are usually most concerned about aid being diverted by including too many, recipients themselves are most concerned about exclusion.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Access to aid may be limited to those with connections, to those who pay bribes or are forced to give sexual favors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Equally, those able to do so may manipulate statistics to inflate the number of beneficiaries and siphon off additional assistance.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Malnutrition, illness, wounds, torture, harassment of specific groups within the population, disappearances, extra-judicial executions and the forcible displacement of people are all found in many armed conflicts. Aside from their direct effects on the individuals concerned, the consequences of these tragedies for local systems must also be considered: the destruction of crops and places of cultural importance, the breakdown of economic infrastructure and of health-care facilities such as hospitals, etc., etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jpcj.htm|title=The impact of humanitarian aid on conflict development - ICRC|first=Pierre|last=Perrin|date=30 June 1998|website=www.icrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on health===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

Corruption plays a huge role in health care system starting from the hospital, to the government and lifted to the other institutions that promote quality and affordable health care to the people. The efficiency of health care delivery in any country is heavily dependent on accountable and transparent systems, proper management of both financial and human resources and timely supply of services to the vulnerable populace of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nazim|first=Habibov|date=March 2016|title=Effect of corruption on healthcare satisfaction in post-soviet nations|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.01.044|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|pages= 119–124|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the basic level, greed skyrockets corruption. When the structure of the health care system is not adequately addressed beginning from oversight in healthcare delivery and supply of drugs and tendering process, mismanagement and misappropriation of funds will always be observed.Corruption also can undermine health care service delivery which in turn disorients the lives of the poor. Corruption leads to violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms as people supposed to benefit from the basic health care from the governments are denied due to unscrupulous processes driven by greed. Therefore, for a country to keep citizens healthy there must be efficient systems and proper resources that can tame the evils like corruption that underpin it.

=== Effects on Education ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

Education forms the basis and the fabric in which a society is transformed and different facets of well-being are shaped.Corruption in higher education has been prevalent and calls for immediate intervention. Increased corruption in higher education has led to growing global concern among governments, students and educators and other stakeholders. Those offering services in the higher education institutions are facing pressure that highly threatens the integral value of higher education enterprise. Corruption in higher education has a larger negative influence, it destroys the relation between personal effort and reward anticipation. Moreover, employees and students develop a belief that personal success does not come from hard work and merit but through canvassing with teachers and taking other shortcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borcan|first=Oana|date=February 2017|title=Fighting corruption in education|url=|journal=American Economic Journal|volume= 9|pages= 180–209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic promotions in the higher education institutions have been disabled by unlimited corruption. Presently, promotion is based on personal connections than professional achievements. This has led to dramatic increase in the number of professors and exhibits their rapid status loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altbach|first=Philiph|date=2015|title=The Question of Corruption|url=|journal=International Higher Education|volume= 34|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utmost the flawed processes in the academic institutions has led to unbaked graduates who are not well fit to the job market. Corruption hinders the international standards of an education system. Additionally, Plagiarism is a form of corruption in academic research, where it affects originality and disables learning. Individual violations are in close relation to the operation ways of a system.

Furthermore, the universities may be in relationships and dealings with business and people in government, which majority of them enrol in doctoral studies without the undergraduate program.Consequently, money, power and related influence compromise education standards since they are fueling factors. A Student may finish thesis report within a shorter time upon which compromises the quality of work delivered and questions the threshold of the higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heyneman|first=Stephen|date=2015|title=The corruption of ethics in higher education|url=|journal=International Higher Education|volume= 62|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other areas:public safety, trade unions, police corruption etc. ===
{{see also|academic corruption}}
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}&lt;!--many scandalous examples, each of which should have a reference to serious documentation--&gt;
Corruption is not specific to poor, developing, or transition countries. In western countries, cases of bribery and other forms of corruption in all possible fields exist: under-the-table payments made to reputed surgeons by patients attempting to be on top of the list of forthcoming surgeries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Cash+bribes+patients+atop+surgery+waiting+lists/3893239/story.html |title=Cash bribes put patients atop surgery waiting lists |publisher=''The Vancouver Sun'' |date=November 27, 2010 |last=Fidelman |first=Charlie |accessdate=2011-01-21 }}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; bribes paid by suppliers to the automotive industry in order to sell low-quality connectors used for instance in safety equipment such as airbags, bribes paid by suppliers to manufacturers of defibrillators (to sell low-quality capacitors), contributions paid by wealthy parents to the "social and culture fund" of a prestigious university in exchange for it to accept their children, bribes paid to obtain diplomas, financial and other advantages granted to unionists by members of the executive board of a car manufacturer in exchange for employer-friendly positions and votes, etc. Examples are endless.

These various manifestations of corruption can ultimately present a danger for public health; they can discredit specific, essential institutions or social relationships.   Osipian summarized a 2008 "study of corruption perceptions among Russians ... .30 percent of the respondents marked the level of corruption as very high, while another 44 percent as high. 19 percent considered it as average and only 1 percent as low. The most corrupt in people's minds are traffic police (33 percent), local authorities (28 percent), police (26 percent), healthcare (16 percent), and education (15 percent). 52 percent of the respondents had experiences of giving money or gifts to
medical professionals while 36 percent made informal payments to educators." He claimed that this corruption lowered the rate of economic growth in Russia, because the students disadvantaged by this corruption could not adopt better work methods as quickly, lowering thereby [[total factor productivity]] for Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osipian|first1=Ararat|title=Education Corruption, Reform, and Growth: Case of Post-Soviet Russia|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/17447/|website=Munich Personal RePEc Archive|publisher=Munich University Library|accessdate=2016-05-21|date=2009-09-22|ref = MPRA Paper No. 17447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption can also affect the various components of sports activities (referees, players, medical and laboratory staff involved in anti-doping controls, members of national sport federation and international committees deciding about the allocation of contracts and competition places).

Cases exist against (members of) various types of non-profit and non-government organizations, as well as religious organizations.

Ultimately, the distinction between public and private sector corruption sometimes appears rather artificial, and national anti-corruption initiatives may need to avoid legal and other loopholes in the coverage of the instruments.

==Types==

===Bribery===
{{Main|Bribery}}
In the context of political corruption, a bribe may involve a payment given to a government official in exchange of his use of official powers. [[Bribery]] requires two participants: one to give the bribe, and one to take it. Either may initiate the corrupt offering; for example, a customs official may demand bribes to let through allowed (or disallowed) goods, or a smuggler might offer bribes to gain passage. In some countries the culture of corruption extends to every aspect of public life, making it extremely difficult for individuals to operate without resorting to bribes. Bribes may be demanded in order for an official to do something he is already paid to do. They may also be demanded in order to bypass laws and regulations. In addition to their role in private financial gain, bribes are also used to intentionally and maliciously cause harm to another (i.e. no financial incentive).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In some developing nations, up to half of the population has paid bribes during the past 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2005/09_12_2005_barometer_2005 |title= How common is bribe-paying? |quote=...a relatively high proportion of families in a group of Central Eastern European, African, and Latin American countries paid a bribe in the previous twelve months. |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120405045051/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2005/09_12_2005_barometer_2005 |archivedate= April 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe]] dissociates active and passive bribery and to incriminates them as separate offences:

* One can define '''active bribery''' as "the promising, offering or giving by any person, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage to any of its public officials, for himself or herself or for anyone else, for him or her to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions" (article 2 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168007f3f5 |title= Criminal Law Convention on Corruption: CETS No. 173 |publisher= Conventions.coe.int |accessdate= 2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Council of Europe]]). 
* '''Passive bribery''' can be defined as "when committed intentionally, the request or receipt by any [...] public officials, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage, for himself or herself or for anyone else, or the acceptance of an offer or a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions" (article 3 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

This dissociation aims to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal-policy point-of-view) that bribery is not acceptable.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Furthermore, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a "fee" to the decision maker to obtain a favorable decision. A working definition of corruption is also provided as follows in article 3 of the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174):&lt;ref name="conventions"/&gt;  ''For the purpose of this Convention, "corruption" means requesting, offering, giving or accepting, directly or indirectly, a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof.

===Trading in influence===
{{Main|Influence peddling}}
[[File:The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|"The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler" (1889)|Reformers like the American [[Joseph Keppler]] depicted the Senate as controlled by the giant moneybags, who represented the nation's financial trusts and monopolies.]]
Trading in influence, or [[influence peddling]], refers a person selling his/her influence over the decision making process to benefit a third party (person or institution). The difference with bribery is that this is a tri-lateral relation. From a legal point of view, the role of the third party (who is the target of the influence) does not really matter although he/she can be an accessory in some instances. It can be difficult to make a distinction between this form of corruption and some forms of extreme and loosely regulated [[lobbying]] where for instance law- or decision-makers can freely "sell" their vote, decision power or influence to those lobbyists who offer the highest compensation, including where for instance the latter act on behalf of powerful clients such as industrial groups who want to avoid the passing of specific environmental, social, or other regulations perceived as too stringent, etc. Where lobbying is (sufficiently) regulated, it becomes possible to provide for a distinctive criteria and to consider that trading in influence involves the use of "improper influence", as in article 12 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; of the [[Council of Europe]].

===Patronage===
{{Main|Patronage}}
[[Patronage]] refers to favoring supporters, for example with government employment. This may be legitimate, as when a newly elected government changes the top officials in the administration in order to effectively implement its policy. It can be seen as corruption if this means that incompetent persons, as a payment for supporting the regime, are selected before more able ones. In nondemocracies many government officials are often selected for loyalty rather than ability. They may be almost exclusively selected from a particular group (for example, [[Sunni]] Arabs in [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq, the [[nomenklatura]] in the [[Soviet Union]], or the [[Junker]]s in [[Imperial Germany]]) that support the regime in return for such favors. A similar problem can also be seen in Eastern Europe, for example in [[Romania]], where the government is often accused of [[patronage]] (when a new government comes to power it rapidly changes most of the officials in the public sector).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher |first=Tom |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443792604577572910124653818 |title=The EU Can't Ignore Its Romania Problem |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- The above was replaced 2014-09-03 with the following reference to Pakistan.  This is unacceptable, because it is potentially libelous without a citation to a credible source.  I'm placing this comment here, because the edit was made anonymously, i.e., by an IP number -- and it was made it 2 steps, which meant that I couldn't just revert it.  If the author is invited to insert this change here again with an appropriate source but without destroying the reference to Romania.  It might be appropriate to add sections on both Romania and Pakistan to the Wikipedia article on "Patronage".  If that was done, it might be appropriate to delete the reference to Romania here, retaining the one to Pakistan -- provided it was supported by solid reference(s). // Addition deleted:  "[[Pakistan]], where the government is often accused of patronage ; namely Benazir, Zardari and Mian Nawaz Sharif are labeled corrupt politicians having numerous cases of corruption. Currently the Prime minister of Pakistan Mian Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shahbaz Sharif are accused of murder."  --&gt;

===Nepotism and cronyism===
{{Main|Nepotism|Cronyism}}
Favoring relatives ([[nepotism]]) or personal friends ([[cronyism]]) of an official is a form of illegitimate private gain. This may be combined with [[bribery]], for example demanding that a business should employ a [[kinship|relative]] of an official controlling regulations affecting the business. The most extreme example is when the entire state is inherited, as in [[North Korea]] or [[Syria]]. A lesser form might be in the Southern United States with [[Good ol' boy]]s, where women and minorities are excluded. A milder form of cronyism is an "[[old boy network]]", in which appointees to official positions are selected only from a closed and exclusive social network – such as the alumni of particular universities – instead of appointing the most competent candidate.

Seeking to harm enemies becomes corruption when official powers are illegitimately used as means to this end. For example, trumped-up charges are often brought up against journalists or writers who bring up politically sensitive issues, such as a politician's acceptance of bribes.

===Gombeenism and parochialism===
{{Main|Gombeen man|Parochialism}}
[[Gombeen man|Gombeenism]] refers to an individual who is dishonest and corrupt for the purpose of personal gain, more often through monetary, while, [[parochialism]] which is also known as parish pump politics relates to placing local or vanity projects ahead of the national interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R.

===Electoral fraud===
{{Main|Electoral fraud}}
'''Electoral fraud''' is illegal interference with the process of an [[election]]. Acts of [[fraud]] affect vote counts to bring about an election result, whether by increasing the vote share of the favored candidate, depressing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both. Also called '''voter fraud''', the mechanisms involved include illegal voter registration, intimidation at polls, voting computer [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]], and improper vote counting.

===Embezzlement===
{{Main|Embezzlement}}
[[Embezzlement]] is the theft of entrusted funds. It is political when it involves public money taken by a public official for use by anyone not specified by the public. A common type of embezzlement is that of personal use of entrusted government resources; for example, when an official assigns public employees to renovate his own house.

===Kickbacks===
{{main|Kickback (bribery)}}
{{see also|Anti-competitive practices|Bid rigging|Fraud|Charbonneau Commission}}
A [[Money trail|kickback]] is an official's share of misappropriated funds allocated from his or her organization to an organization involved in corrupt [[bidding]]. For example, suppose that a politician is in charge of choosing how to spend some public funds. He can give a [[contract]] to a [[General contractor|company]] that is not the best bidder, or allocate more than they deserve. In this case, the company benefits, and in exchange for betraying the public, the official receives a kickback payment, which is a portion of the sum the company received. This sum itself may be all or a portion of the difference between the actual (inflated) payment to the company and the (lower) market-based price that would have been paid had the bidding been competitive.

Another example of a kickback would be if a judge receives a portion of the profits that a business makes in exchange for his judicial decisions.

Kickbacks are not limited to government officials; any situation in which people are entrusted to spend funds that do not belong to them are susceptible to this kind of corruption.

===Unholy alliance===
{{Main|Unholy alliance (geopolitical)}}
An [[Unholy alliance (geopolitical)|unholy alliance]] is a coalition among seemingly antagonistic groups for [[ad hoc]] or hidden gain, generally some influential non-governmental group forming ties with political parties, supplying funding in exchange for the favorable treatment. Like patronage, unholy alliances are not necessarily illegal, but unlike patronage, by its deceptive nature and often great financial resources, an unholy alliance can be much more dangerous to the [[public interest]]. An early use of the term was by former US President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt]]:

:"To destroy this invisible Government, to dissolve the '''unholy alliance''' between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day." – 1912 [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] Platform, attributed to Roosevelt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patricia O''Toole Sunday, Jun. 25, 2006 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1207791-2,00.html |title=O'Toole, Patricia, "The War of 1912," TIME in Partnership with CNN, Jun. 25, 2006 |publisher=Time.com |date=2006-06-25 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quoted again in his autobiography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/55/15b.html |title=Roosevelt, Theodore. ''An Autobiography:'' XV. The Peace of Righteousness, Appendix B, New York: Macmillan, 1913 |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he connects [[trust (19th century)|trusts]] and [[monopoly|monopolies]] (sugar interests, [[Standard Oil]], etc.) to [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Howard Taft]], and consequently both major [[political parties]].

===Involvement in organized crime===
An illustrative example of official involvement in [[organized crime]] can be found from 1920s and 1930s [[Shanghai]], where Huang Jinrong was a police chief in the [[French concession]], while simultaneously being a gang boss and co-operating with [[Du Yuesheng]], the [[Green Gang|local gang]] ringleader. The relationship kept the flow of profits from the gang's gambling dens, prostitution, and protection rackets undisturbed.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The United States accused [[Manuel Noriega]]'s government in [[Panama]] of being a "[[narcokleptocracy]]", a corrupt government profiting on [[illegal drug trade]]. Later the U.S. invaded Panama and captured Noriega.

==Conditions favorable for corruption==
It is argued that the following conditions are favorable for corruption:
* Information deficits
** Lacking [[freedom of information legislation]]. In contrast, for example: The Indian [[Right to Information Act]] 2005 is perceived to have "already engendered mass movements in the country that is bringing the lethargic, often corrupt bureaucracy to its knees and changing power equations completely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=52046 |title=AsiaMedia :: Right to Information Act India's magic wand against corruption |publisher=Asiamedia.ucla.edu |date=2006-08-31 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926172330/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=52046 |archivedate=2008-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Lack of investigative reporting in the local media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/investigative_journalists_as_anti_corruption_activists_interview_gerardo_re |title=Investigative journalists as anti-corruption activists: An interview with Gerardo Reyes |publisher=Transparency.org |date=2013-06-07 |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Contempt for or negligence of exercising [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]].
** Weak [[accounting]] practices, including lack of timely financial management.
** Lack of measurement of corruption. For example, using regular surveys of households and businesses in order to quantify the degree of perception of corruption in different parts of a nation or in different government institutions may increase awareness of corruption and create pressure to combat it. This will also enable an evaluation of the officials who are fighting corruption and the methods used.
** [[Tax haven]]s which tax their own citizens and companies but not those from other nations and refuse to disclose information necessary for foreign taxation. This enables large-scale political corruption in the foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,,1994976,00.html |title=Western bankers and lawyers 'rob Africa of $150bn every year |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date=2007-01-21 |accessdate=2009-12-05 | location=London | first=Nick | last=Mathiason}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
* Lacking control of the government.
** Lacking [[civic society]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s which monitor the government.
** An individual voter may have a [[rational ignorance]] regarding politics, especially in nationwide elections, since each vote has little weight.
** Weak [[civil service]], and slow pace of [[Civil service reform in developing countries|reform]].
** Weak [[rule of law]].
** Weak [[Lawyer|legal profession]].
** Weak [[judicial independence]].
** Lacking protection of [[whistleblower]]s.
*** [[Government Accountability Project]]
** Lack of [[benchmarking]], that is continual detailed evaluation of procedures and comparison to others who do similar things, in the same government or others, in particular comparison to those who do the best work. The Peruvian organization Ciudadanos al Dia has started to measure and compare transparency, costs, and efficiency in different government departments in Peru. It annually awards the best practices which has received widespread media attention. This has created competition among government agencies in order to improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/why_benchmarkin.html#more |title=Why benchmarking works – PSD Blog – World Bank Group |publisher=Psdblog.worldbank.org |date=2006-08-17 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920181947/http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/why_benchmarkin.html#more |archive-date=2009-09-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Individual officials routinely handle cash, instead of handling payments by [[giro]] or on a separate cash desk – illegitimate withdrawals from supervised bank accounts are much more difficult to conceal.
** Public funds are centralized rather than distributed. For example, if $1,000 is embezzled from a local agency that has $2,000 funds, it is easier to notice than from a national agency with $2,000,000 funds. See the [[subsidiarity|principle of subsidiarity]].
** Large, unsupervised public investments.
** Pay disproportionately lower than that of the average citizen. 
** Government licenses needed to conduct business, e.g., [[import license]]s, encourage bribing and kickbacks.
** Long-time work in the same position may create relationships inside and outside the government which encourage and help conceal corruption and favoritism. Rotating government officials to different positions and geographic areas may help prevent this; for instance certain high rank officials in French government services (e.g. [[Trésor public|treasurer-paymasters general]]) must rotate every few years.
** Costly [[political campaign]]s, with expenses exceeding normal sources of political funding, especially when funded with taxpayer money.
** A single group or family controlling most of the key government offices.  Lack of laws forbidding and limiting number of members of the same family to be in office .
** Less interaction with officials reduces the opportunities for corruption. For example, using the Internet for sending in required information, like applications and tax forms, and then processing this with automated computer systems. This may also speed up the processing and reduce unintentional human errors. See [[e-Government]].
** A windfall from exporting abundant natural resources may encourage corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaide.edu.au/cies/papers/0320.pdf |title=Resources for Sale: Corruption, Democracy and the Natural Resource Curse |format=PDF |last1=Damania |first1=Richard |first2=Erwin |last2=Bulte |date=July 2003 |publisher=Centre for International Economic Studies, University of Adelaide |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906123659/http://www.adelaide.edu.au/cies/papers/0320.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See [[Resource curse]])''
** [[War]] and other forms of conflict correlate with a breakdown of [[public security]].
* Social conditions
** Self-interested closed cliques and "[[old boy network]]s".
** Family-, and clan-centered social structure, with a tradition of [[nepotism]]/favouritism being acceptable.
** A [[gift economy]], such as the Soviet [[Blat (term)|blat]] system, emerges in a Communist [[centrally planned economy]].
** Lacking [[literacy]] and [[education]] among the population.

===Media===
[[q:Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson]] observed a tendency for "The functionaries of every government ... to command at will the liberty and property of their constituents.  There is no safe deposit [for liberty and property] ... without information. Where the press is free, and every man able to read, all is safe."

Recent research supports Jefferson's claim.  Brunetti and Weder found "evidence of a significant relationship between more press freedom and less corruption in a large cross-section of countries." They also presented "evidence which suggests that the direction of causation runs from higher press freedom to lower corruption."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Snyder and Strömberg found "that a poor fit between newspaper markets and political districts reduces press coverage of politics. ...

An analysis of the evolution of mass media in the [[United States]] and [[European Union]] since World War II noted mixed results from the growth of the Internet:  "The digital revolution has been good for freedom of expression [and] information [but] has had mixed effects on freedom of the press":  It has disrupted traditional sources of funding, and new forms of Internet journalism have replaced only a tiny fraction of what's been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Starr| first = Paul | year = 2012

===Size of public sector===
Extensive and diverse public spending is, in itself, inherently at risk of cronyism, kickbacks, and embezzlement. Complicated regulations and arbitrary, unsupervised official conduct exacerbate the problem. This is one argument for [[privatization]] and [[deregulation]]. Opponents of privatization see the argument as ideological. The argument that corruption necessarily follows from the opportunity is weakened by the existence of countries with low to non-existent corruption but large public sectors, like the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sachs110 |title=Lessons From the North|publisher=Project Syndicate |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries score high on the [[Ease of Doing Business Index]], due to good and often simple regulations and have [[rule of law]] firmly established. Therefore, due to their lack of corruption in the first place, they can run large public sectors without inducing political corruption. Recent evidence that takes both the size of expenditures and regulatory complexity into account has found that high-income democracies with more expansive state sectors do indeed have higher levels of corruption.&lt;ref name="www-wds.worldbank" /&gt;

Like other governmental economic activities, also privatization, such as in the sale of government-owned property, is particularly at the risk of cronyism. Privatizations in Russia, Latin America, and East Germany were accompanied by large-scale corruption during the sale of the state-owned companies. Those with political connections unfairly gained large wealth, which has discredited privatization in these regions. While media have reported widely the grand corruption that accompanied the sales, studies have argued that in addition to increased operating efficiency, daily petty corruption is, or would be, larger without privatization and that corruption is more prevalent in non-privatized sectors. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that extralegal and unofficial activities are more prevalent in countries that privatized less.&lt;ref&gt;Privatization in Competitive Sectors: The Record to Date. Sunita Kikeri and John Nellis. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 2860, June 2002. [http://www.econ.chula.ac.th/about/member/sothitorn/privatization.pdf Econ.Chula.ac.th] artimort.pdf IDEI.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325112620/http://www.econ.chula.ac.th/about/member/sothitorn/privatization.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the principle of subsidiarity is applied: a government service should be provided by the lowest, most local authority that can competently provide it. An effect is that distribution of funds in multiple instances discourages embezzlement because even small sums missing will be noticed. In contrast, in a centralized authority, even minute proportions of public funds can be large sums of money.

==Governmental corruption==
If the highest echelons of the governments also take advantage of corruption or embezzlement from the state's treasury, it is sometimes referred to the [[neologism]] ''[[kleptocracy]]''. Members of the government can take advantage of the [[natural resource]]s (e.g., diamonds and oil in a few prominent cases) or state-owned productive industries. A number of corrupt governments have enriched themselves via foreign aid. Indeed, there is a positive correlation between aid flows and high levels of corruption within recipient countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Svensson |first=Jakob |year=2000 |title=Foreign Aid and Rent-Seeking |doi=10.1016/S0022-1996(99)00014-8 |journal=Journal of International Economics |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=437–461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Alesina |first=Alberto |authorlink=Alberto Alesina |last2=Weder |first2=Beatrice |authorlink2=Beatrice Weder di Mauro |year=2002 |title=Do Corrupt Governments Receive less Foreign Aid? |doi=10.1257/00028280260344669 |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=92 |issue=4 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A corrupt [[dictatorship]] typically results in many years of general hardship and suffering for the vast majority of citizens as [[civil society]] and the [[rule of law]] disintegrate. In addition, corrupt dictators routinely ignore economic and [[society|social]] problems in their quest to amass ever more wealth and power.

The classic case of a corrupt, exploitive dictator often given is the regime of [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko]], who ruled the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (which he renamed [[Zaire]]) from 1965 to 1997. It is said that usage of the term [[kleptocracy]] gained popularity largely in response to a need to accurately describe Mobutu's regime. Another classic case is [[Nigeria]], especially under the rule of General [[Sani Abacha]] who was ''[[de facto]]'' president of Nigeria from 1993 until his death in 1998.  He is reputed to have stolen some [[US$]]3–4 billion.  He and his relatives are often mentioned in [[Advance-fee fraud|Nigerian 419 letter scams]] claiming to offer vast fortunes for "help" in laundering his stolen "fortunes", which in reality turn out not to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Who wants to be a millionaire? – An online collection of Nigerian scam mails&lt;/ref&gt; More than $400 billion was stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nigeria's corruption totals $400 billion |publisher=''[[Malaysia Today]]'' |date=June 27, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211033642/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2005/06/nigerias-corruption-totals-400-billion.htm |archivedate=2007-12-11|url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2005/06/nigerias-corruption-totals-400-billion.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, articles in various financial periodicals, most notably ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, have pointed to [[Fidel Castro]], General Secretary of the Republic of [[Cuba]] from 1959 until his death in 2016, of likely being the beneficiary of up to $900 million, based on "his control" of state-owned companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/2006-05-04-castro_x.htm |title=Fidel Castro net worth rises, according to 'Forbes' |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2006-05-04 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of his regime claim that he has used money amassed through weapons sales, narcotics, international loans, and confiscation of private property to enrich himself and his political cronies who hold his dictatorship together, and that the $900 million published by [[Forbes]] is merely a portion of his assets, although that needs to be proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro |first=Ben |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BenShapiro/2006/08/02/the_death_of_fidel_castro |title=Ben Shapiro :: Townhall.com :: The death of Fidel Castro |publisher=Townhall.com |date=2006-08-05 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judiciary corruption==
There are two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private. [[Budget]] of the judiciary in many transitional and [[developing countries]] is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject of the [[constitutional economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Peter |last=Barenboim |title= Defining the rules |publisher= The European Lawyer |volume= Issue 90 |date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judicial corruption]] can be difficult to completely eradicate, even in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pahis|first1=Stratos|title=Corruption in Our Courts: What It Looks Like and Where It Is Hidden|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=2009|volume=118|accessdate=1 August 2015|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/corruption-in-our-courts-what-it-looks-like-and-where-it-is-hidden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mobile telecommunications]] and [[radio broadcasting]] help to fight corruption, especially in developing regions like [[Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voicesfromemergingmarkets.com/?p=19 |title=Mobile Phones and Radios Combat Corruption in Burundi – Voices from Emerging Markets |publisher=Voicesfromemergingmarkets.com |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630142547/http://voicesfromemergingmarkets.com/?p=19 |archivedate=2009-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where other forms of [[communication]]s are limited.
In India, the anti-corruption bureau fights against corruption, and a new ombudsman bill called [[Jan Lokpal Bill]] is being prepared.

In the 1990s, initiatives were taken at an international level (in particular by the [[European Community]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[OECD]]) to put a ban on corruption: in 1996, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/cm/Home_en.asp |title=Committee of Ministers – Home |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, adopted a comprehensive Programme of Action against Corruption and, subsequently, issued a series of anti-corruption standard-setting instruments:
* the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173);&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
* the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174);&lt;ref name="conventions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=174&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=7/18/2008&amp;CL=ENG |title=Criminal Law Convention on Corruption: CETS No. 174 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Additional Protocol to the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 191);&lt;ref name="conventions_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=191&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=7/18/2008&amp;CL=ENG |title=Additional Protocol to the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption: CETS No. 191 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Twenty Guiding Principles for the Fight against Corruption (Resolution (97) 24);&lt;ref name="coe.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/documents/Resolution(97)24_EN.pdf |title=Council of Europe: Resolution (97) 24: On the Twenty Guiding Principles for the Fight Against Corruption |publisher=Coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Recommendation on Codes of Conduct for Public Officials (Recommendation No. R (2000) 10);&lt;ref name="Rec 2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/documents/Rec(2000)10_EN.pdf |title=Recommendation No. R (2000) 10 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on Codes of Conduct for Public Officials |publisher=Coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Recommendation on Common Rules against Corruption in the Funding of Political Parties and Electoral Campaigns (Rec(2003)4)&lt;ref name="Rec 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/general/Rec(2003)4_EN.pdf |title=Recommendation No. R (2003) 4 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on Common Rules against Corruption |publisher=Coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of these instruments was to address the various forms of corruption (involving the public sector, the private sector, the financing of political activities, etc.) whether they had a strictly domestic or also a transnational dimension. To monitor the implementation at national level of the requirements and principles provided in those texts, a monitoring mechanism – the [[Group of States Against Corruption]] (also known as GRECO) (French: Groupe d'Etats contre la corruption) was created.

Further conventions were adopted at the regional level under the aegis of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS or OEA), the [[African Union]], and in 2003, at the universal level under that of the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]].

==Whistleblowers==&lt;!-- dummy edit to identify attribution ; can be deleted. --&gt;

{{Main|Whistleblower}}
A whistleblower (also written as whistle-blower or whistle blower) is a person who exposes any kind of information or activity that is deemed illegal, unethical, or not correct within an organization that is either private or public. The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways: violation of company policy/rules, law, regulation, or threat to public interest/national security, as well as fraud, and corruption. Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to the surface either internally or externally. Internally, a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor. Externally, a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media, government, law enforcement, or those who are concerned. Whistleblowers, however, take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing.

Because of this, a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers. Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far. Whistleblowers face legal action, criminal charges, social stigma, and termination from any position, office, or job. Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on private sector, or public sector. Depending on many factors, both can have varying results. However, whistleblowing in the public sector organization is more likely to result in criminal charges and possible custodial sentences. A whistleblower who chooses to accuse a private sector organization or agency is more likely to face termination and legal and civil charges.

Deeper questions and theories of whistleblowing and why people choose to do so can be studied through an ethical approach. Whistleblowing is a topic of ongoing ethical debate. Leading arguments in the ideological camp that whistleblowing is ethical to maintain that whistleblowing is a form of civil disobedience, and aims to protect the public from government wrongdoing. In the opposite camp, some see whistleblowing as unethical for breaching confidentiality, especially in industries that handle sensitive client or patient information. Legal protection can also be granted to protect whistleblowers, but that protection is subject to many stipulations. Hundreds of laws grant protection to whistleblowers, but stipulations can easily cloud that protection and leave whistleblowers vulnerable to retaliation and legal trouble. However, the decision and action have become far more complicated with recent advancements in technology and communication. Whistleblowers frequently face reprisal, sometimes at the hands of the organization or group they have accused, sometimes from related organizations, and sometimes under law. Questions about the legitimacy of whistleblowing, the moral responsibility of whistleblowing, and the appraisal of the institutions of whistleblowing are part of the field of political ethics.

==Measuring corruption==
Measuring corruption accurately is difficult if not impossible due to the illicit nature of the transaction and imprecise definitions of corruption.&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |title=A Users' Guide to Measuring Corruption |publisher=[[Global Integrity]] |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131012755/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Few reliable measures of the magnitude of corruption exists and among those, there is a high level of heterogeneity. One of the most common ways to estimate corruption is through perception surveys. They have the advantage of good coverage, however, they do not measure corruption precisely.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olken|first=Benjamin A.|last2=Pande|first2=Rohini|date=|title=Corruption in Developing Countries|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/73081/1/Olken_Corruption%20in.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Economics|volume=4|pages=479–509|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080511-110917}}&lt;/ref&gt; While "corruption" indices first appeared in 1995 with the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] CPI, all of these metrics address different proxies for corruption, such as public perceptions of the extent of the problem.&lt;ref name="Galtung, Fredrik 2006"&gt;Galtung, Fredrik (2006). "Measuring the Immeasurable: Boundaries and Functions of (Macro) Corruption Indices," in Measuring Corruption, Charles Sampford, Arthur Shacklock, Carmel Connors, and Fredrik Galtung, Eds. (Ashgate): 101–130.&lt;/ref&gt; However, over time the refinement of methods and validation checks against objective indicators has meant that, while not perfect, many of these indicators are getting better at consistently and validly measuring the scale of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/113281515516828746/pdf/WPS8299.pdf |title= Can We Measure the Power of the Grabbing Hand?

[[Transparency International]], an anti-corruption [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], pioneered this field with the CPI, first released in 1995. This work is often credited with breaking a taboo and forcing the issue of corruption into high-level development policy discourse. Transparency International currently publishes three measures, updated annually: a CPI (based on aggregating third-party polling of public perceptions of how corrupt different countries are); a Global Corruption Barometer (based on a survey of general public attitudes toward and experience of corruption); and a [[Bribe Payers Index]], looking at the willingness of foreign firms to pay bribes. The Corruption Perceptions Index is the best known of these metrics, though it has drawn much criticism&lt;ref name="Galtung, Fredrik 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sik |first=Endre |year=2002 |chapter=The Bad, the Worse and the Worst: Guesstimating the Level of Corruption |title=Political Corruption in Transition: A Skeptic's Handbook |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Kotkin |editor2-first=Andras |editor2-last=Sajo |location=Budapest |publisher=Central European University Press |pages=91–113 |isbn=963-9241-46-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, Christiane and Charles Oman (2006).

The World Bank collects a range of data on corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/governance/data/ |title=WBI Governance &amp; Anti-Corruption – Data |publisher=Worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; including survey responses from over 100,000 firms worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/Data/ExploreTopics/corruption |title=Corruption – World Bank Survey of Business Managers |publisher=Enterprisesurveys.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a set of indicators of governance and institutional quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.worldbank.org/IU54LJVHT0 |title=Public Sector Governance – Indicators of Governance &amp; Institutional Quality |publisher=Go.worldbank.org |date=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, one of the six dimensions of governance measured by the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] is Control of Corruption, which is defined as "the extent to which power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as 'capture' of the state by [[elite]]s and private interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance |year=2007 |publisher=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, The World Bank |page=3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527211855/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the definition itself is fairly precise, the data aggregated into the Worldwide Governance Indicators is based on any available polling: questions range from "is corruption a serious problem?" to measures of public access to information, and not consistent across countries. Despite these weaknesses, the global coverage of these datasets has led to their widespread adoption, most notably by the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]].&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/&gt;

A number of parties have collected survey data, from the public and from experts, to try and gauge the level of corruption and bribery, as well as its impact on political and economic outcomes.&lt;ref name="bath.ac.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, A 2014"/&gt;
A second wave of corruption metrics has been created by [[Global Integrity]], the International Budget Partnership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalbudget.org|title=Home - International Budget Partnership|website=International Budget Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many lesser known local groups.

These second wave projects aim to create policy change by identifying resources more effectively and creating checklists toward incremental reform.

Typical second wave corruption metrics do not offer the worldwide coverage found in first wave projects and instead focus on localizing information gathered to specific problems and creating deep, "unpackable"{{clarify|date=December 2014}} content that matches quantitative and qualitative data.

Alternative approaches, such as the British aid agency's Drivers of Change research, skips numbers and promotes understanding corruption via political economy analysis of who controls power in a given society.&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7047">{{Regulation of therapeutic goods in the United States}}In [[patent]] [[law]], the '''research exemption''' or '''safe harbor exemption''' is an exemption to the rights conferred by patents, which is especially relevant to [[medication|drugs]]. According to this exemption, despite the patent rights, performing [[research]] and tests for preparing regulatory approval, for instance by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in the [[United States]], does not constitute [[patent infringement|infringement]] for a limited term before the end of [[term of patent|patent term]].&lt;ref&gt;"The principle behind the Bolar exemption is that generic companies should be in a position to take the necessary preparatory measures in order to be able to enter the market without delay once patent protection expires." in [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t110223eu1.html Decision T 0223/11 dated 22 May 2012 of the Board of Appeal  	3.3.02 of the European Patent Office], reasons 2, fifth paragraph. &lt;/ref&gt; This exemption allows generic manufacturers to prepare [[generic drug]]s in advance of the patent expiration.

In the [[United States]], this exemption is also technically called '''[[Section sign|§]] 271(e)(1) exemption''' or '''Hatch-Waxman exemption'''. In 2005, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] considered the scope of the Hatch-Waxman exemption in ''[[Merck v. Integra]]''.  The Supreme Court held that the statute exempts from infringement ''all'' uses of compounds that are reasonably related to submission of information to the government under any law regulating the manufacture, use or distribution of drugs.

In [[Canada]], this exemption is known as the '''Bolar provision''' or '''Roche-Bolar provision''', named after the case ''[[Roche Products v. Bolar Pharmaceutical]]''.

In the [[European Union]], equivalent exemptions are allowed under the terms of [[European Union Directive|EC Directives]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0082:EN:HTML 2001/82/EC] (as amended by Directive [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0028:EN:HTML 2004/28/EC]) and [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0083:EN:HTML 2001/83/EC] (as amended by Directives [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0098:EN:HTML 2002/98/EC], [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0063:EN:HTML 2003/63/EC], [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0024:EN:HTML 2004/24/EC] and [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0027:EN:HTML 2004/27/EC]).

== Common law research exemption ==
The [[common law]] research exemption is an [[affirmative defense]] to infringement where the alleged infringer is using a patented invention for research purposes.  The [[doctrine]] originated in the 1813 decision by Justice [[Joseph Story]] appellate decision  ''[[Whittemore v. Cutter]]'', 29 Fed. Cas. 1120 (C.C.D. Mass. 1813). Story famously wrote that the intent of the legislature could not have been to punish someone who infringes "merely for [scientific] experiments, or for the purpose of ascertaining the sufficiency of the machine to produce its described effects."  Subsequent decisions later distinguished between commercial and non-commercial research.
{{anchor|madey}}

In 2002, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] dramatically limited the scope of the research exemption in ''[[Madey v. Duke University]]'', 307 F.3d 1351, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  The court did not reject the defense, but left only a "very narrow and strictly limited experimental use defense" for "amusement, to satisfy idle curiosity, or for strictly philosophical inquiry."  The court also precludes the defense where, regardless of profit motive, the research was done "in furtherance of the alleged infringer’s legitimate business." In the case of a research [[university]] like [[Duke University]], the court held that the alleged use was in furtherance of its legitimate business - namely "increas[ing] the status of the institution and lur[ing] lucrative research grants", and thus the defense was inapplicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weschler |first1=Cristina |title=The Informal Experimental Use Exception: University Research After Madey v. Duke University |journal=New York University Law Review |date=October 2004 |volume=79 |issue=4 |url=http://www.nyulawreview.org/sites/default/files/pdf/NYULawReview-79-4-Weschler.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Merck KGaA v. Integra Lifesciences I, Ltd.]]'', 545 U.S. 193 (2005), the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that the use of patented compounds in preclinical studies is protected under 35 U.S.C §271(e)(1) if there is a reasonable basis to believe that the compound tested could be the subject of an FDA submission and if the experiments will produce the types of information relevant to an [[Investigational New Drug]] or [[New Drug Application]].

In cases where the Supreme Court has ruled narrowly (e.g., pharmaceutical drugs only) and a lower court has [[Circuit split|ruled more broadly]], further litigation in the lower courts will often be necessary before a subsequent case will resolve the issue more generally as a matter of settled [[Case law in the United States|case law]].&lt;ref name=Split&gt;{{cite book |last=Perry|first=H.W. |title=Deciding to decide: agenda setting in the United States Supreme Court |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=1991|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEDxr2-dda8C&amp;pg=PA251 251]|isbn=978-0-674-19442-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEDxr2-dda8C |accessdate=2009-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International framework ==
This type of exception is permitted by Article 30 of the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]'s [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPs Agreement]]:
{{cquote|Members may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.}}

The '''separation of church and state''' is a philosophic and [[Jurisprudence|jurisprudential]] concept for defining political distance in the relationship between [[religious organizations]] and the [[nation state]]. Conceptually, the term refers to the creation of a [[secular state]] (with or without legally explicit church–state separation) and to disestablishment, the changing of an existing, formal relationship between the church and the state.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States'' (1992), Kermit D.

In a society, the degree of political separation between the church and the civil state is determined by the legal structures and prevalent legal views that define the proper relationship between organized religion and the state. The [[arm's length principle]] proposes a relationship wherein the two political entities interact as organizations independent of the authority of the other. The strict application of secular principle of ''[[laïcité]]'' (secularity) is used in France, while secular societies, such as Denmark and the United Kingdom, maintain a form of constitutional recognition of an official [[state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.no/page/view/norway-separates-church-and-state#.UPFSb-Q0VPE|title=Norway separates church and state|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of the separation of the church from the civil state parallels the philosophies of [[secularism]], [[disestablishmentarianism]], [[religious liberty]], and [[religious pluralism]], by way of which the European states assumed some of the social roles of the church, the [[welfare state]], a social shift that produced a culturally secular population and [[public sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn Princeton University WordNet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508073028/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=May 8, 2016 }} reads: "separationism: advocacy of a policy of strict separation of church and state."&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, church–state separation varies from total separation, mandated by the country's political [[constitution]], as in [[Religion in India|India]] and [[Religion in Singapore|Singapore]], to a state religion, as in [[Freedom of religion in the Maldives|the Maldives]].

==History of the concept and term==
{{More citations needed| date = August 2016}}

===Late antiquity===
[[File:Carlo Crivelli - St. Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|''St. Augustine'' by [[Carlo Crivelli]]]]
An important contributor to the discussion concerning the proper relationship between Church and state was St. [[Augustine]], who in ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', Book XIX, Chapter 17, examined the ideal relationship between the "earthly city" and the "city of God". In this work, Augustine posited that major points of overlap were to be found between the "earthly city" and the "city of God", especially as people need to live together and get along on earth.  Thus, Augustine held that it was the work of the "temporal city" to make it possible for a "heavenly city" to be established on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
{{Main|Church and state in medieval Europe}}
For centuries, monarchs ruled by the idea of [[divine right of kings|divine right]]. Sometimes this began to be used by a monarch to support the notion that the king ruled both his own kingdom and Church within its boundaries, a theory known as [[caesaropapism]]. On the other side was the Catholic doctrine that the [[Bishop of Rome|Pope]], as the Vicar of Christ on earth, should have the ultimate authority over the Church, and indirectly over the state. Moreover, throughout the Middle Ages the [[Pope]] claimed the right to depose the Catholic kings of Western Europe and tried to exercise it, sometimes successfully (see the investiture controversy, below), sometimes not, such as was the case with [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Henry IV of France|Henry III]] of [[Navarre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iiYQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165 |title=Delineation of Roman Catholicism: Drawn from the authentic and acknowledged standards of the Church of Rome|first=Charles|last=Elliott|year=1877|page=165 |origyear=1851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West the issue of the separation of church and state during the medieval period centered on monarchs who [[sphere sovereignty|ruled in the secular sphere]] but encroached on the Church's rule of the spiritual sphere. This unresolved contradiction in ultimate control of the Church led to power struggles and crises of leadership, notably in the [[Investiture Controversy]], which was resolved in the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. By this concordat, the Emperor renounced the right to invest ecclesiastics with ring and crosier, the symbols of their spiritual power, and guaranteed election by the canons of cathedral or abbey and free consecration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Berman |first= Harold J. |title= Law and Revolution: The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition |publisher= Harvard University Press |year= 1983 |isbn= 0-674-51774-1 |oclc= 185405865 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===
At the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, [[Martin Luther]] articulated a [[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]. According to [[James Madison]], perhaps one of the most important modern proponents of the separation of church and state, Luther's doctrine of the two kingdoms marked the beginning of the modern conception of separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I6tLmjLqRfAC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;dq=madison+luther+%22led+the+way%22#PPA242,M1 |title=Madison to Schaeffer, 1821 |pages=242–43 |year=1865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those of the [[Radical Reformation]] (the [[Anabaptist]]s) took Luther's ideas in new direction, most notably in the writings of [[Michael Sattler]] (1490–1527), who agreed with Luther that there were two kingdoms, but differed in arguing that these two kingdoms should be separate, and hence baptized believers should not vote, serve in public office or participate in any other way with the "kingdom of the world." While there was a diversity of views in the early days of the Radical Reformation, in time Sattler's perspective became the normative position for most Anabaptists in the coming centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhsc.ca/index.php?content=http://www.mhsc.ca/mennos/bchurchstate.htm|title=MHSC|website=www.mhsc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anabaptists came to teach that religion should never be compelled by state power, approaching the issue of church-state relations primarily from the position of protecting the church from the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/issues/issue-28/1525-anabaptist-movement-begins.html|title=1525 The Anabaptist Movement Begins|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Church-State_Relations|title=Church-State Relations - GAMEO|website=gameo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bender, H. S. "The Anabaptists and Religious Liberty in the Sixteenth Century." ''Mennonite Quarterly Review'' 29 (1955): 83–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1530s, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], angered by the [[Pope Clement VII]]'s refusal to annul his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], decided to break with the Church and set himself as ruler of the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/monarchs/mon41.html|title=Henry VIII: 1509-47 AD|publisher=Britannia History|accessdate=2008-03-26|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchs of Great Britain have retained ecclesiastical authority in the Church of England since Henry VIII, having the current title, ''[[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]''. England's ecclesiastical intermixing did not spread widely, however, due to the [[Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom|extensive persecution]] of [[Catholic]]s that resulted from Henry's power grab.{{clarify|date=November 2015}} This eventually led to [[Nonconformism]], [[English Dissenters]], and the anti-Catholicism of [[Oliver Cromwell]], the [[Commonwealth of England]], and the [[penal law (Britain)|Penal Laws]] against Catholics and others who did not adhere to the Church of England.

One of the results of the persecution in England was that some people fled Great Britain to be able to worship as they wished – but they did not seek religious freedom, and early North American colonies were generally as intolerant of religious dissent as England; Puritan [[Massachusetts]], for example, did not allow standard Church of England worship. Some of these people voluntarily sailed to the American Colonies specifically for this purpose. After the American Colonies [[American Revolutionary War|famously revolted]] against [[George III of the United Kingdom]], the [[Constitution of United States]] was specifically amended to ban the establishment of religion by [[American Congress|Congress]].

=== Enlightenment ===
[[File:John Locke by Herman Verelst.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Locke]], English [[political]] [[philosopher]] argued for individual conscience, free from state control]]
The concept of separating church and state is often credited to the writings of English philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704).&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 29 ("It took [[John Locke]] to translate the demand for liberty of conscience into a systematic argument for distinguishing the realm of government from the realm of religion.")&lt;/ref&gt; According to his principle of the [[social contract]], Locke argued that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority. These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with his social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same period of the 17th century, [[Pierre Bayle]] and some [[Fideism|fideists]] were forerunners of the separation of Church and State, maintaining that faith was independent of reason.&lt;ref name=Bayle11&gt;{{cite book |last=Tinsley |first=Barbara Sher|title=Pierre Bayle's Reformation : conscience and criticism on the eve of the Enlightenment|year=2001|publisher=Susquehanna University Press |location=Selinsgrove, Pa. |isbn=1575910438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bayle22&gt;{{cite book |last=Bayle |first=Pierre |year=2000 |orig-year=1st ed 1682 |title=Various Thoughts on Occasion of a Comet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UueopQAmgzUC&amp;pg=PR23 |publisher=SUNY Press |page=332 |isbn=9780791492734}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century, the ideas of Locke and Bayle, in particular the separation of Church and State, became more common, promoted by the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. [[Montesquieu]] already wrote in 1721 about religious tolerance and a degree of separation between religion and government.&lt;ref name="DarienMcWhirter"&gt;{{cite book |last=McWhirter|first=Darien|title=Exploring the separation of church and state|year=1994|publisher=Oryx Press|location=Phoenix, Ariz.|isbn=9780897748520}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Voltaire]] defended some level of separation but ultimately subordinated the Church to the needs of the State&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Masters|first=Voltaire.

===Jefferson and the Bill of Rights===
{{Main|Establishment Clause|Free Exercise Clause}}
[[File:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Jefferson]], the third [[President of the United States]], whose letter to the Danbury Baptists Association is often quoted in debates regarding the separation of church and state.]]

In English, the exact term is an offshoot of the phrase, "wall of separation between church and state", as written in [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s letter to the [[Baptists in the history of separation of church and state#American Baptists|Danbury Baptist Association]] in 1802. In that letter, referencing the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], Jefferson writes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.&lt;ref name=Jefferson11&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html| title = Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists| accessdate = 2006-11-31| last = Jefferson| first = Thomas| date = 1802-01-01| publisher = U.S. Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jefferson was describing to the Baptists that the [[United States Bill of Rights]] prevents the establishment of a national church, and in so doing they did not have to fear government interference in their right to expressions of religious conscience. The Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791 as ten amendments to the [[Constitution of the United States]], was one of the earliest political expressions of religious freedom.  Others were the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], also authored by Jefferson and adopted by Virginia in 1786; and the French [[Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789]].

==In various countries==
{{split section|date=April 2018}}
{{See also|Secular state|Laïcité|Secularism|Pseudo-Secularism|Secular humanism}}
Countries have varying degrees of separation between government and religious institutions.  Since the 1780s  a number of countries have set up explicit barriers between church and state. The degree of actual separation between government and religion or religious institutions varies widely.  In some countries the two institutions remain heavily interconnected. There are new conflicts in the post-Communist world.{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}&lt;!-- Like what?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Péter Tibor Nagy|title=The social and political history of Hungarian education – State-Church relations in the history of educational policy of the first post-communist Hungarian government|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03700/03797/03797.htm#10|isbn=963-200-511-2|publisher=Hungarian Electronic library|accessdate=2007-04-27|edition = HTML}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The many variations on separation can be seen in some countries with high degrees of religious freedom and tolerance combined with strongly secular political cultures which have still maintained state churches or financial ties with certain religious organizations into the 21st century.  In England, there is a constitutionally established [[state religion]] but [[religious toleration|other faiths are tolerated]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Status of religious freedom by country#United Kingdom|Status of religious freedom by country]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British monarch]] is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], and 26 bishops ([[Lords Spiritual]]) sit in the upper house of government, the [[House of Lords]].

In other kingdoms the [[head of government]] or [[head of state]] or other high-ranking official figures may be legally required to be a member of a given faith. Powers to appoint high-ranking members of the state churches are also often still vested in the worldly governments. These powers may be slightly anachronistic or superficial, however, and disguise the true level of religious freedom the nation possesses.  In the case of Andorra there are two heads of state, neither of them native Andorrans. One is the Roman Catholic Bishop of Seu de Urgell, a town located in northern Spain. He has the title of Episcopalian Coprince (the other Coprince being the French Head of State). Coprinces enjoy political power in terms of law ratification and constitutional court designation, among others.

===Australia===
[[File:Hbhiggins.jpg|thumb|right|[[H. B. Higgins]], proponent of Section&amp;nbsp;116 in the Australian pre-Federation constitutional conventions|alt=A black and white portrait of [[H. B. Higgins]]]]
{{main|Section 116 of the Australian Constitution}}
The [[Constitution of Australia]] prevents the Commonwealth from establishing any religion or requiring a religious test for any office:

{{quote|Ch 5 § 116 The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.}}

The language is derived from the United States' constitution, but has been altered. Following the usual practice of the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], it has been interpreted far more narrowly than the equivalent US sections and no law has ever been struck down for contravening the section. Today, the Commonwealth Government provides broad-based funding to religious schools. The Commonwealth used to fund religious chaplains, but the High Court in ''[[Williams v Commonwealth]]'' found the funding agreement invalid under Section 61. However, the High Court found that Section 116 had no relevance, as the chaplains themselves did not hold office under the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|23|2012|litigants=[[Williams v Commonwealth]]}} {{cite web|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2012/hca23-2012-06-20.pdf|title= judgement summary|date=20 June 2012 |publisher=[[High Court of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Australian parliaments are opened with a Christian prayer, and the preamble to the Australian Constitution refers to a "humbl[e] rel[iance] on the blessing of Almighty God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Constitution/preamble Preamble to ''Commonwealth of Australian Constitution Act''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920070013/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Constitution/preamble |date=September 20, 2016 }} (Imp.) 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Australian monarch is [[Elizabeth II]], also British monarch and Governor of the [[Church of England]], her Australian title is unrelated to her religious office and she has no role in the [[Anglican Church of Australia]]. The prohibition against religious tests has allowed former Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane [[Peter Hollingworth]] to be appointed [[Governor-General of Australia]], the highest domestic constitutional officer; however, this was criticised.&lt;ref name="hogan"&gt;Hogan, M. (2001, May 16). [http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2001/05/hogan.html Separation of church and state?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310121449/http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2001/05/hogan.html |date=March 10, 2016 }} ''Australian Review of Public Affairs''. Retrieved 2010-10-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite inclusion in the "States" chapter, Section 116 does not apply to states because of changes during drafting, and they are free to establish their own religions. Although no state has ever introduced a state church (New South Wales restricted religious groups during the early colonial period), the legal body corresponding to many religious organisations is established by state legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|act|acoaca1960408|Anglican Church of Australia Constitution Act 1960}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|act|lcoavdia1971629|Lutheran Church of Australia Victorian District Incorporation Act 1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been two referenda to extend Section 116 to states, but both failed. In each case the changes were grouped with other changes and voters did not have the opportunity to expressly accept only one change. Most states permit broad exemptions to religious groups from anti-discrimination legislation; for example, the New South Wales act allowing same-sex couples to adopt permits religious adoption agencies to refuse them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Advocate.com Editors |url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/09/03/NSW_Parliament_Passes_Adoption_Bill/ |title=Adoption Bill Passed in NSW &amp;#124; News |publisher=The Advocate |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130072816/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/09/03/NSW_Parliament_Passes_Adoption_Bill/ |archivedate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|num_act|aasca2010n66377|Adoption Amendment (Same Sex Couples) Act 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current situation, described as a "principle of state neutrality" rather than "separation of church and state",&lt;ref name="hogan"/&gt; has been criticised by both secularists and religious groups. On the one hand, secularists have argued that government neutrality to religions leads to a "flawed democrac[y]"&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M. (2005).

According to the Constitution of Azerbaijan, the state and religion are separate. Article 7 of the Constitution defines the Azerbaijani state as a democratic, legal, secular, unitary republic. Therefore, the Constitution provides freedom of religions and beliefs.

The Azerbaijani State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations controls the relations between the state and religions.

Brazil was a [[Colonial Brazil|colony]] of the [[Portuguese Empire]] from 1500 until the nation's [[Independence of Brazil|independence]] from Portugal, in 1822, during which time [[Roman Catholicism]] was the official state religion. With the rise of the [[Empire of Brazil]], although Catholicism retained its status as the official creed, subsidized by the state, other religions were allowed to flourish, as the [[History of the Constitution of Brazil|1824 Constitution]] secured [[religious freedom]]. The fall of the Empire, in 1889, gave way to a Republican regime, and a Constitution was enacted in 1891, which severed the ties between church and state; Republican ideologues such as [[Benjamin Constant (Brazil)|Benjamin Constant]] and [[Ruy Barbosa]] were influenced by [[laïcité]] in France and the United States. The 1891 Constitutional separation of Church and State has been maintained ever since. The current [[Constitution of Brazil]], in force since 1988, ensures the right to religious freedom, bans the establishment of state churches and any relationship of "dependence or alliance" of officials with religious leaders, except for "collaboration in the public interest, defined by law".

===Croatia===
{{main|Religion in Croatia}}
[[File:Ustav Republike Hrvatske br 1.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|right|"Constitution no. 1", which is kept in the great hall of the Palace of the [[Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia|Constitutional Court]] and is used on the occasion of the [[Croatian presidential inauguration|presidential inauguration]]]]
[[Freedom of religion]] in [[Croatia]] is a right defined by the [[Croatian Constitution|Constitution]], which also defines all religious communities as equal in front of the law and separated from the state. Principle of separation of church and state is enshrined in Article 41 which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All religious communities shall be equal before the law and clearly separated from the state. Religious communities shall be free, in compliance with law, to publicly conduct religious services, open schools, academies or other institutions, and welfare and charitable organizations and to manage them, and they shall enjoy the protection and assistance of the state in their activities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public schools allow religious teaching ({{lang-hr|Vjeronauk}}) in cooperation with religious communities having agreements with the state, but attendance is not mandated. Religion classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools.

The public holidays also include religious festivals of: [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], [[Easter Monday]], [[Corpus Christi Day]], [[Assumption Day]], [[All Saints' Day]], [[Christmas]], and [[Boxing Day]]. The primary holidays are based on the Catholic liturgical year, but other believers are allowed to celebrate other major religious holidays as well.

The [[Roman Catholic Church in Croatia]] receives state financial support and other benefits established in [[concordat]]s between the Government and the Vatican. In an effort to further define their rights and privileges within a legal framework, the government has additional agreements with other 14 religious communities: [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] (SPC), [[Islamic Community of Croatia]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Church]], [[Reformed Christian Church in Croatia]], [[Protestant Reformed Christian Church in Croatia]], [[Pentecostal Church]], [[Union of Pentecostal Churches of Christ]], [[Christian Adventist Church]], [[Baptist Union of Croatia|Union of Baptist Churches]], [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]], [[Church of Christ]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Reformed Movement of Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] and Croatian [[Old Catholic Church]].

===Finland===
The [[Constitution of Finland]] declares that the organization and administration of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] is regulated in the Church Act, and the organization and administration of the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] in the Orthodox Church Act. The Lutheran Church and the Orthodox Church thus have a special status in Finnish legislation compared to other religious bodies, and are variously referred to as either "national churches" or "state churches", although officially they do not hold such positions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Khag6tbsIn4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=constitution+of+finland+church+act&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SyaSALeKWe&amp;sig=i9jOA2Ja-zalh7G-KT3JGBj6vKQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1uYX6ronOAhVMWywKHY7DCxgQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=constitution%20of%20finland%20church%20act&amp;f=false Jeroen Temperman, 2010, State-Religion Relationships and Human Rights Law: Towards a Right to Religiously Neutral Governance, p. 45] {{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lutheran Church does not consider itself a state church, and prefers to use the term "national church".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Valtiokirkko purettu kansankirkoksi | trans-title = State Church Dismantled into National Church | publisher = Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland   | work = evl.fi | date = 24 November 2006 | accessdate = 23 July 2016 | url = http://evl.fi/EVLfi.nsf/Documents/85BBFB4816F713BEC2256FEA003A7232 | language = fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finnish Freethinkers Association has criticized the official endorsement of the two churches by the Finnish state, and has campaigned for the separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eroakirkosta.fi]] – [http://eroakirkosta.fi/media/taustatietoa/toiminta-ajatus.html Palvelun tavoite: Kirkko on erotettava valtiosta] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307032405/http://eroakirkosta.fi/media/taustatietoa/toiminta-ajatus.html |date=March 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[File:Liberte-egalite-fraternite-tympanum-church-saint-pancrace-aups-var.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Motto of the French republic on the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of a church in [[Aups]], Var département, which was installed after the 1905 law on the Separation of the State and the Church. Such inscriptions on a church are very rare; this one was restored during the 1989 bicentennial of the [[French Revolution]].]]
The French version of separation of church and state, called [[laïcité]], is a product of French history and philosophy. It was formalized in a [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law]] providing for the separation of church and state, that is, the separation of religion from political power.

This model of a secularist state protects the religious institutions from state interference, but with public religious expression to some extent frowned upon. This aims to protect the public power from the influences of religious institutions, especially in public office. Religious views which contain no idea of public responsibility, or which consider religious opinion irrelevant to politics, are not impinged upon by this type of secularization of public discourse.

Former President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] criticised "negative laicite" and talked about a "positive laïcité" that recognizes the contribution of faith to French culture, history and society, allows for faith in the public discourse and for government subsidies for faith-based groups.&lt;ref name="christiantoday.com"&gt;Beita, Peter B. [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/french.presidents.religious.mixing.riles.critics/16423.htm French President's religious mixing riles critics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420223313/http://www.christiantoday.com/article/french.presidents.religious.mixing.riles.critics/16423.htm |date=April 20, 2016 }} Christianity Today, January 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He visited the [[Pope]] in December 2007 and publicly emphasized France's [[Christian]] roots, while highlighting the importance of [[freedom of thought]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/sarkozy.breaks.french.taboo.on.church.and.politics/15760.htm |title=Sarkozy breaks French taboo on church and politics |publisher=Christiantoday.com |date=2007-12-23 |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating that [[faith]] should come back into the [[public sphere]]. [[François Hollande]] took a very different position during the [[French presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], promising to insert the concept of laïcité into the constitution. In fact, the French constitution only says that the French Republic is "laïque" but no article in the 1905 law or in the constitution defines laïcité.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=French president rejects calls for secular values to be in constitution|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1200356.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130215164402/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1200356.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 15, 2013|accessdate=2 February 2013|newspaper=Catholic News|date=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are certain entanglements in France which include:
* The most significant example consists in two areas, [[Alsace]] and [[Moselle]] (see {{format link|Local law in Alsace-Moselle#Religion}} for further detail), where the 1802 [[Concordat#France|Concordat]] between France and the Holy See still prevails because the area was part of Germany when the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]] was passed and the attempt of the laicist [[Cartel des gauches]] in 1924 failed due to public protests. Catholic priests as well as the clergy of three other religions (the Lutheran [[EPCAAL]], the Calvinist [[EPRAL]], and Jewish [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistories]]) are paid by the state, and schools have religion courses. Moreover, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Metz|Catholic bishops of Metz]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Strasbourg|of Strasbourg]] are named (or rather, formally appointed) by the French Head of State on proposition of the Pope. In the same way, the presidents of the two official Protestant churches are appointed by the State, after proposition by their respective Churches. This makes the French President the only temporal power in the world to formally have retained the right to appoint Catholic bishops, all other Catholic bishops being appointed by the Pope.
* In French Guyana the Royal Regulation of 1828 makes the French state pay for the Roman Catholic clergy, but not for the clergy of other religions.
* In the French oversea départements and territories since the 1939 décret Mandel the French State supports the Churches.  
* The French President is ''ex officio'' a [[co-prince of Andorra]], where Roman Catholicism has a status of state religion (the other co-prince being the [[Bishop of Urgell|Roman Catholic Bishop of Seu de Urgell]], Spain). Moreover, French heads of states are traditionally offered an honorary title of [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Papal Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]], Cathedral of Rome. Once this honour has been awarded to a newly elected president, France pays for a ''choir vicar'', a priest who occupies the seat in the canonical chapter of the Cathedral in lieu of the president (all French presidents have been male and at least formally Roman Catholic, but if one were not, this honour could most probably not be awarded to him or her.)  The French President also holds a seat in a few other canonical chapters in France.
* Another example of the complex ties between France and the Catholic Church consists in the ''Pieux Établissements de la France à Rome et à Lorette'': five churches in Rome ([[Trinità dei Monti]], St. Louis of the French, St. Ivo of the Bretons, St. Claude of the Free County of Burgundy, and St. Nicholas of the Lorrains) as well as a chapel in [[Loreto, Marche|Loreto]] belong to France, and are administered and paid for by a special foundation linked to the French embassy to the Holy See.
* In [[Wallis and Futuna]], a French overseas territory, national education is conceded to the diocese, which gets paid for it by the State
* A further entanglement consists in liturgical honours accorded to French consular officials under Capitations with the Ottoman Empire which persist for example in the Lebanon and in ownership of the Catholic cathedral in Smyrna (Izmir) and the extraterritoriality of St. Anne's in Jerusalem and more generally the diplomatic status of the Holy Places.

The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]] guarantees [[freedom of religion]],&lt;ref name="Section 4 of German Basic Law"&gt;Section 4 of German Basic Law&lt;/ref&gt; but there is not a complete separation of church and state in Germany. Officially recognized religious bodies operate as ''Körperschaften des öffentlichen Rechts'' ([[statutory corporation|corporations of public law]], as opposed to private). For recognized religious communities, some taxes are collected by the state;&lt;ref&gt;Binder, Gerhard/Wagner, Jürgen, Grundwissen Grundgesetz.p 165.Klett.&lt;/ref&gt; this is at the request of the religious community and a fee is charged for the service.&lt;ref&gt;1.5% to 4.5% of the amount collected, depending on the state (''Land'')&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last = Leif | editor1-first = Thomas| editor2-first = Rudolf | editor2-last=Speth| title = Die fünfte Gewalt: Lobbyismus in Deutschland|trans-title=The Fifth Estate: Lobbyism in Germany| year = 2006| publisher = VL Verlag| language = German| isbn = 978-3-531-15033-8| page = 262| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious instruction is an optional school subject in Germany.&lt;ref name="Section 4 of German Basic Law" /&gt; The German State understands itself as neutral in matters of religious beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;Binder, Gerhard/Wagner, Jürgen, Grundwissen Grundgesetz.p 17.

===India===
{{main|Religion in India|Freedom of religion in India}}
India is a secular country and there are no special provisions favouring specific religions in its constitution.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

As a result of such government power over religion, politicians are sometimes accused of playing vote bank politics, i.e. of giving political support to issues for the sole purpose of gaining the votes of members of a particular community, including religious communities. Both the [[Indian National Congress|Indian National Congress party]] and the [[BJP|Bharitiya Janata Party (BJP)]] have been accused of exploiting the people by indulging in vote bank politics. The [[Shah Bano case]], a divorce lawsuit, generated much controversy when the Congress was accused of appeasing the Muslim orthodoxy by bringing in a parliamentary amendment to negate the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court's]] decision. After the [[2002 Gujarat violence]], there were allegations of political parties indulging in vote bank politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Times News Network | title = Togadia wants parties to stop 'vote bank politics' | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-03-25/ahmedabad/27127436_1_vhp-leader-togadia-hindus | work = indiatimes.com | publisher = Times Internet Limited | date = 25 March 2002 | accessdate = 2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===

In [[Italy]] the principle of separation of church and state is enshrined in Article 7 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The State and the Catholic Church are independent and sovereign, each within its own sphere. Their relations are regulated by the Lateran pacts. Amendments to such Pacts which are accepted by both parties shall not require the procedure of constitutional amendments."

===Japan===
[[Shinto]] became the [[state religion]] in Japan with the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, and suppression of other religions ensued.&lt;ref name="japan2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/1120/21PRPLJ363.pdf?sequence=1|title=SEPARATION OF RELIGION AND STATE IN JAPAN: A PRAGMATIC INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES 20 AND 89 OF THE JAPANESE CONSTITUTION|author=Andrew B.

The [[Shinto Directive]] issued by the occupation government required that all state support for and involvement in any religious or Shinto institution or doctrine stop, including funding, coverage in textbooks, and official acts and ceremonies.  Adopted in 1947, Articles 20 and 89 of the Japanese constitution protect freedom of religion, and prevent the government from compelling religious observances or using public money to benefit religious institutions.&lt;ref name="japan2012"/&gt;

===South Korea===
{{main|Freedom of religion in South Korea}}
Freedom of religion in South Korea is provided for in the South Korean constitution, which mandates the separation of religion and state, and prohibits discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/religious-freedom-in-south-korea|title=Religious Freedom in South Korea|publisher=Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
{{See also|Laïcité#Mexico|Holy See-Mexico relations}}
The issue of the role of the [[Catholic Church in Mexico]] has been highly divisive since the 1820s. Its large land holdings were especially a point of contention. Mexico was guided toward what was proclaimed a separation of church and state by [[Benito Juárez]] who, in 1859, attempted to eliminate the role of the Roman Catholic Church in the nation by appropriating its land and prerogatives.&lt;ref name=mexhistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/mexico.htm|title=Mexico, A brief History|publisher=history-world.org|accessdate=2007-10-13|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LeyLerdoClements&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=548|title=Ley Lerdo|first=Greg|last=Clements|publisher=historicaltextarchive.com|accessdate=2007-10-13|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859 the [[Ley Lerdo]] was issued – purportedly separating church and state, but actually involving state intervention in Church matters by abolishing monastic orders, and nationalizing church property. President [[Benito Juárez]] confiscated church property. He disbanded religious orders and ordered the separation of church and state at [[Constitution of Mexico]].

In 1926, after several years of the [[Mexican revolutionary war]] and insecurity, President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], an atheist and leader of the ruling [[National Revolutionary Party (Mexico)|National Revolutionary Party]], enacted the [[Calles Law]], which eradicated all the personal property of the churches, closed churches that were not registered with the State, and prohibited clerics from holding a public office. The law was unpopular; and several protesters from rural areas, fought against federal troops in what became known as the [[Cristero War]]. After the war's end in 1929, President [[Emilio Portes Gil]] upheld a previous truce where the law would remain enacted, but not enforced, in exchange for the hostilities to end.

Ever since, the Catholic Church has remained active through the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]]. The party gained a major foothold in 2000 when President [[Vicente Fox]] was elected, ending 70 years of unbroken rule from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]].

===Norway===
On 21 May 2012, the [[Norwegian Parliament]] passed a [[Norwegian Constitution|constitutional]] amendment that granted the [[Church of Norway]] increased autonomy, and states that "the Church of Norway, an Evangelical-Lutheran church, remains Norway's people's church, and is supported by the State as such" ("people's church" or folkekirke is also the name of the Danish state church, [[Folkekirken]]), replacing the earlier expression which stated that "the Evangelical-Lutheran religion remains the public religion of the State." The final amendment passed by a vote of 162–3. The three dissenting votes were all from the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]].

The constitution also says that Norway's values are based on its Christian and humanist heritage, and according to the Constitution, the [[List of Norwegian monarchs#House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg|King]] is required to be Lutheran. The government will still provide funding for the church as it does with other faith-based institutions, but the responsibility for appointing bishops and provosts will now rest with the church instead of the government. Prior to 1997, the appointments of parish priests and residing chaplains was also the responsibility of the government, but the church was granted the right to hire such clergy directly with the new Church Law of 1997. Nevertheless, even after the changes in 1997 and 2012, all clergy remain civil servants (state employees), the central and regional church administrations remain a part of the [[Ministry of Government Administration, Reform and Church Affairs|state administration]], the Church of Norway is regulated by its own law (kirkeloven) and all municipalities are required by law to support the activities of the Church of Norway and municipal authorities are represented in its local bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Church of Norway#Legal status|"Church of Norway"]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
In Article II "Declaration of Principles and State Policies", Section 6, the [[1987 Constitution of the Philippines]] declares, "The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable." This reasserts, with minor differences  in wording and capitalization, a declaration made in Article XV, Section 15 of the 1973 Constitution.&lt;ref name=1987constII&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/the-philippine-constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-ii/|title=THE 1987 CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES – ARTICLE II|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1973const&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/the-philippine-constitutions/the-amended-1973-constitution/|title=The Amended 1973 Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Article III, Section 5 declares, "No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights."; echoing Article IV, Section 8 of the 1973 Constitution verbatim.&lt;ref name=1973const /&gt;&lt;ref name=1987III&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/the-philippine-constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-iii/|title=THE 1987 CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES – ARTICLE III|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
{{main|Religion in Romania}}
[[Romania]] is a [[Secularism|secular]] country and has no state religion. However, the role of religion in society is regulated by several articles of the Romanian Constitution.

Art 29. Freedom of Conscience. (1) Freedom of thought and opinion, as well as freedom of religion, cannot be limited in any way. No one shall be coerced to adopt an opinion or adhere to a religious faith against their will.
(5) Religious cults are autonomous in relation to the state, which provides support including the facilitation of religious assistance in the army, hospitals, penitentiaries, retirement homes and orphanages.

Art 32. Right to education (7) The state assures freedom of religious education, according to the requirements of each specific cult. In state schools, religious education is organized and guaranteed by law.

===Saudi Arabia===
{{main|Legal system of Saudi Arabia}}
The legal system of Saudi Arabia is based on [[Sharia]], [[Islam]]ic law derived from the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]] (the traditions) of the [[Muhammad|Islamic prophet Muhammad]], and therefore no separation of church and state is present.

===Singapore===
{{main|Religion in Singapore}}
Singapore is home to people of many religions and, as such, the Singaporean government has attempted to avoid giving any specific religions priority over the rest.

In 1972 the Singapore government de-registered and banned the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses in Singapore. The Singaporean government claimed that this was justified because members of Jehovah's Witnesses refuse to perform military service (which is obligatory for all male citizens), salute the [[Singaporean flag|flag]], or swear oaths of allegiance to the state.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5732.htm|title=Singapore|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Singapore", ''International Religious Freedom Report 2004'', U.

In Spain, commentators have posited that the form of church-state separation enacted in France in 1905 and found in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1931]] are of a "hostile" variety, noting that the hostility of the state toward the church was a cause of the breakdown of democracy and the onset of the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Arguing Comparative Politics"&gt;Stepan, Alfred, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nR2tF4k1PXUC&amp;dq Arguing Comparative Politics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914183055/https://books.google.com/books?id=nR2tF4k1PXUC&amp;dq |date=September 14, 2016 }}'', p. 221, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne25.htm |title=Payne, Stanley G.

Religious freedom was guaranteed only [[Spanish organic law referendum, 1966|in 1966]], nine years before the end of the regime. Since 1978, according to the Spanish Constitution (section 16.3) "No religion shall have a state character. The public authorities shall take into account the religious beliefs of Spanish society and shall consequently maintain appropriate cooperation relations with the Catholic Church and other confessions."

=== Sweden ===
The [[Church of Sweden]] was instigated by [[Gustav I of Sweden|King Gustav I]] (1523–60) and within the half century following his death had become established as a [[Lutheran]] state church with significant power in Swedish society, itself under the control of the state apparatus. A degree of freedom of worship (for foreign residents only) was achieved under the rule of [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] (1771–92), but it was not until the passage of the Dissenter Acts of 1860 and 1874 that Swedish citizens were allowed to leave the state church – and then only provided that those wishing to do so first registered their adhesion to another, officially approved denomination. Following years of discussions that began in 1995, the Church of Sweden was finally separated from the state as from 1 January 2000. However, the separation was not fully completed. Although the status of state religion came to an end, the Church of Sweden nevertheless remains Swedens national church, and as such is still regulated by the government through the law of the Church of Sweden. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refer to a change of relation between state and church rather than a separation. Furthermore, the Swedish constitution still maintain that the Sovereign and the members of the royal family has to confess an evangelical Lutheran faith, which in practice means they need to be members of the Church of Sweden to remain in the line of succession. Thusly according to the ideas of [[cuius regio, eius religio]] one could argue that the symbolic connection between state and church still remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/januaryweb-only/11.0.html|title=Swedish Church State Separate|publisher=Christianity Today|first=Ted|last=Olsen|date=1 January 2000|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
{{Main|Religion in Switzerland}}
The articles 8 ("Equality before the law") and 15 ("Freedom of religion and conscience") of the [[Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation]] guarantees individual freedom of beliefs.&lt;ref name=CstCH&gt;[https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19995395/index.html Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621000507/https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19995395/index.html |date=June 21, 2016 }}, status as of 14 June 2015, [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland]] (page visited on 17 December 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; It notably states that " No person may be forced to join or belong to a religious community, to participate in a religious act or to follow religious teachings".&lt;ref name=CstCH/&gt;

Churches and state are separated at the federal level since 1848. However, the article 72 ("Church and state") of the [[Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation|constitution]] determine that "The regulation of the relationship between the church and the state is the responsibility of the cantons".&lt;ref name=CstCH/&gt; Some [[cantons of Switzerland]] recognise officially some churches ([[Catholic Church]], [[Swiss Reformed Church]], [[Old Catholic Church]] and [[Jews|Jewish congregations]]). Other cantons, such as [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] and [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]] are ''[[laïcité|laïques]]'' (that is to say, secular).

===Turkey===
{{Further|Secularism in Turkey}}

Turkey, whose population is overwhelmingly Muslim, is also considered to have practiced the [[laïcité]] school of secularism since 1928, which the founding father [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s [[Atatürk's Reforms|policies]] and theories became known as [[Kemalism]].

Despite Turkey being an officially secular country, the Preamble of the Constitution states that "there shall be no interference whatsoever of the sacred religious feelings in State affairs and politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/english/constitution.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810204816/http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/english/constitution.htm|archivedate=2006-08-10|title = The Constitution of the Republic of Turkey|publisher = Turkish Grand National Assembly (TBMM)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to control the way religion is perceived by adherents, the State pays [[imam]]s' wages (only for Sunni Muslims), and provides religious education (of the Sunni Muslim variety) in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. The State has a Department of Religious Affairs, directly under the Prime Minister bureaucratically, responsible for organizing the [[Sunni]] Muslim religion – including what will and will not be mentioned in sermons given at [[mosque]]s, especially on Fridays. Such an interpretation of secularism, where religion is under strict control of the State is very different from that of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and is a good example of how secularism can be applied in a variety of ways in different regions of the world.
The exercise of their religion in Turkey by the Greek Orthodox and the Armenian Apostolic communities is partly regulated by the terms of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. No such official recognition extends to the Syriac communities.

Under [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s tenure since 2003, Turkish secularism has come under heavy fire as a new [[Islamist]] [[populist]] mood has overtaken Turkish politics. Erdoğan has pursued a suite of policies determined to give state backing to particular interpretations of Islam.

===United Kingdom===
The [[Church of England]], a part of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], is an [[established church]], and the [[British monarchy|British Sovereign]] is the titular [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]], and cannot be a Roman Catholic. Until the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]], the monarch could not be married to a Catholic.

In state-run schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (but not in privately run schools), there is a requirement for a daily act of worship that is "wholly or mainly of a Christian character", although non-Christian faith schools are exempt (instead having to have their own form of worship) and sixth-form pupils (in England and Wales) and parents of younger pupils can opt out. Official reports have recommended removing the requirement entirely.&lt;ref name="guardian2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/dec/06/religious-teaching-school-assemblies-axe-report|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|date=2015-12-06|accessdate=2017-07-30|title=Top judge leads calls to scrap mandatory daily Christian worship in UK schools|publisher=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court of the United Kingdom has ruled in favour of challenges, brought by pupil families supported by the [[British Humanist Association]], to secondary-level religious studies exam syllabuses that excluded non-religious worldviews.&lt;ref name="guardian2015" /&gt;

In England, senior Church appointments are Crown appointments; the Church carries out state functions such as coronations; Anglican representatives have an automatic role on [[Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education|Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education]]; and 26 diocesan bishops have seats in the [[House of Lords]], where they are known as the [[Lords Spiritual]] as opposed to the [[laity|lay]] [[Lords Temporal]]. The Lords Spiritual have a significant influence when they vote as a bloc on certain issues, notably moral issues like abortion and [[euthanasia]]. All of state-funded schools in England are religious school, too, and most are controlled by the Church of England, with significant numbers of state-funded Catholic, Muslim, and Jewish schools as well. The Anglican Church also has specific legal rights and responsibilities in solemnised marriages that are different from other faith organisations. Non-religious couples can have a [[civil wedding]] with no religious elements, but non-religious [[humanist celebrant|humanist weddings]] are not yet legally recognised in their own right. Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all schools, but parents can remove their children from these lessons, and sixth formers have the right to opt out.

The [[Church of Scotland]] (or Kirk) is the largest religious denomination in Scotland, however, unlike the Church of England it is [[Presbyterian]] and (since 1921) not a branch of the state, with the Sovereign holding no formal role in the Church other than being an ordinary member. However, though the Kirk is disestablished, Scotland is not a secular polity. The Kirk remains a [[national church]] to which the state has special obligations; it is conventional that the monarch, who is head of state, must attend the Church when she visits Scotland, and they swear in their accession oath to maintain and preserve the church. The state also gives numerous preferences to the Church of Scotland and Catholic Church, particularly in education. The [[blasphemy law]] has not been abolished in Scotland, though it has fallen into disuse. Non-religious couples can have a [[civil wedding]] with no religious elements, and [[humanist celebrant|humanist weddings]] have been legally recognised since 2005, and enshrined in Scottish law since 2017. Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all schools, but parents can remove their children from these lessons, though sixth formers have no right to opt out.

The [[Church of Ireland]] was disestablished as early as 1871; the [[Church in Wales]] was disestablished in 1920 (although certain border parishes remain part of the Established Church of England).&lt;ref name=Enyedi2003&gt;{{cite book |last1=Madeley|first1=John T. S. |last2=Enyedi|first2=Zsolt|title=Church and state in contemporary Europe: the chimera of neutrality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5Brda6FmswC|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-5394-5|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=n5Brda6FmswC&amp;pg=PA203 203]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the UK Government and to some extent the Scottish Government, the [[Welsh Government]] has no religious links, though state-funded religious schools are routinely approved in Wales. Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all Welsh schools.

Northern Ireland is the most religious part of the UK, but technically has secular governance. However, in practice, it is the least secular in the UK. Schools, as in Ireland, are largely divided between Anglican and Catholic schools, and identification with one community or the other is often sought on equal opportunities-monitoring forms. The religious education curriculum is drawn up exclusively by six Christian churches, to the exclusion of other religions or beliefs, and collective worship is mandatory in all schools.

===United States===
{{Main|Accommodationism|Separation of church and state in the United States}}
[[File:James Madison.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[James Madison]], drafter of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]]]
The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] which ratified in 1791 states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." However, the phrase "separation of church and state" itself does not appear in the [[United States Constitution]].

The phrase of Jefferson ([[#Jefferson and the Bill of Rights|see above]]) was quoted by the [[United States Supreme Court]] first in 1878, and then in a series of cases starting in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;William M. Wiecek, ''The birth of the modern Constitution: the United States Supreme Court, 1941–1953'' (Cambridge  U.P., 2006) pp. 261–64&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court did not consider the question of how this applied to the states until 1947; when they did, in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'', the court [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporated]] the establishment clause, determining that it applied to the states and that a law enabling reimbursement for busing to all schools (including parochial schools) was constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Kermit Hall, ed. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cY3er3ilgjcC The Oxford companion to the Supreme Court of the United States] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134840/https://books.google.com/books?id=cY3er3ilgjcC |date=March 4, 2016 }}'' (2005) pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cY3er3ilgjcC&amp;pg=PA303 303–04] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130907/https://books.google.com/books?id=cY3er3ilgjcC&amp;pg=PA303 |date=March 4, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its incorporation, unsuccessful attempts were made to amend the constitution to explicitly apply the establishment clause to states in the 1870s and 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hamburger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q6Axd76IE1UC&amp;dq ''Separation of Church and State''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624192830/https://books.google.com/books?id=q6Axd76IE1UC&amp;dq |date=June 24, 2016 }}. pp. 10-11, 287–334, 342, Harvard University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kermit Hall, ed.

The concept was implicit in the flight of [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] from religious oppression in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] to found the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]] on the principle of state neutrality in matters of faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Neil A.|title=Rebels and renegades: a chronology of social and political dissent in the United States|edition=illustrated|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-93639-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jZymqT1HmqAC&amp;pg=PA11 11]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jZymqT1HmqAC|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bercovitch

Williams was motivated by historical abuse of governmental power, and believed  that government must remove itself from anything that touched upon human beings' relationship with God,   advocating a "hedge or wall of Separation between the Garden of the Church and the Wilderness of the world" in order to keep the church pure.

Through his work Rhode Island's charter was confirmed  by [[King Charles II of England]], which  explicitly stated that no one was to be "molested, punished, disquieted, or called in question, for any differences in opinion, in matters of religion."

Williams is credited with helping to shape the church and state debate in England, and influencing such men as [[John Milton]] and particularly John Locke, whose work was studied closely by Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and other designers of the U.S. Constitution. Williams theologically derived his views mainly from Scripture and his motive is seen as religious, but Jefferson's advocation of religious liberty is seen as  political and social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Barry |first=John M. |date=January 2012 |title=Roger Williams and the Creation of the American Soul |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/God-Government-and-Roger-Williams-Big-Idea.html |magazine=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early treaties and court decisions====

=====The Treaty of Paris=====
{{Main|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}
In 1783, the United States signed a treaty with [[Great Britain]] that was promulgated "in the name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity".&lt;ref name="BittkerIdlemanRavitch"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bittker |first1=Boris I. |last2=Idleman |first2=Scott C. |last3=Ravitch |first3=Frank S. |title=Religion and the State in American Law |date=2015 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9781107071827 |page=2 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dipped in religious language, crediting "'Divine Providence' with having disposed the two parties to 'forget all past misunderstandings,' and is dated 'in the year of our Lord' 1783."&lt;ref name="BittkerIdlemanRavitch"/&gt;

=====The Treaty of Tripoli=====
{{Main|Treaty of Tripoli}}
In 1797, the [[United States Senate]] ratified a treaty with [[Tripoli]] that stated in Article 11: 

{{quote|As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of [[Musulman|Mussulmen]]; and, as the said States never entered into any war, or act of hostility against any [[Mohammedan|Mahometan]] nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions, shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;For full text see [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/bar1796t.asp "The Barbary Treaties 1786–1816; Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Signed at Tripoli November 4, 1796" Avalon Project]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Frank Lambert, Professor of History at [[Purdue University]], the assurances in Article 11 were

&lt;blockquote&gt;intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced. President [[John Adams]] and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Introduction | chapterurl= http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7500.html | title= The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America | work= Introduction | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | date=February 3, 2005| first=Frank| last=Lambert| isbn=978-0-691-12602-9| quote=By their actions, the Founding Fathers made clear that their primary concern was religious freedom, not the advancement of a state religion. Individuals, not the government, would define religious faith and practice in the United States. Thus the Founders ensured that in no official sense would America be a Christian Republic. Ten years after the Constitutional Convention ended its work, the country assured the world that the United States was a secular state, and that its negotiations would adhere to the rule of law, not the dictates of the Christian faith. The assurances were contained in the Treaty of Tripoli of 1797 and were intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced. John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Supporters of the separation of church and state argue that this treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, confirms that the government of the United States was specifically intended to be religiously neutral.&lt;ref&gt;F. Forrester Church. ''The separation of church and state'' (2004) p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty was submitted by President Adams and unanimously ratified by the Senate.

=====Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States=====
{{Main|Church of the Holy Trinity v. United_States#Christian_nation}}
In the 1892 case ''[[Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States]]'', Supreme Court Justice [[Justice David Brewer|David Brewer]] wrote for a unanimous Court that "no purpose of action against religion can be imputed to any legislation, state or national, because this is a religious people. ... [T]his is a Christian nation."&lt;ref name="Finkelman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=Religion and American Law: An Encyclopedia |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136919565 |page=76 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal historian [[Paul Finkelman]] writes that: 
{{quotation|Brewer, the son of a Congregationalist missionary to Asia Minor, quoted several colonial charters, state constitutions, and court decisions that referred to the importance of Christian belief in the affairs of the American people; cited the practice of various legislative bodies of beginning their sessions with prayer, and noted the large number of churches and Christian charitable organizations that exist in every community in the country as evidence that this is a Christian nation. In doing so, Brewer expressed the prevailing nineteenth-century Protestant view that America is a Christian nation.&lt;ref name="Finkelman"/&gt;}}

====Use of the phrase====
The phrase "separation of church and state" is derived from a letter written by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1802 to  [[Danbury Baptists|Baptists from Danbury, Connecticut]], and published in a Massachusetts newspaper soon thereafter. In that letter, referencing the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], Jefferson writes: 

{{quote|Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof", thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State.&lt;ref name=Jefferson11 /&gt;}}

Another early user of the term was [[James Madison]], the principal drafter of the [[United States Bill of Rights]].  In a 1789 debate in the House of Representatives regarding the draft of the First Amendment, the following was said: 

{{quote|August 15, 1789. Mr. [Peter] Sylvester [of New York] had some doubts. … He feared it [the First Amendment] might be thought to have a tendency to abolish religion altogether. … Mr. [Elbridge] Gerry [of Massachusetts] said it would read better if it was that "no religious doctrine shall be established by law." … Mr. [James] Madison [of Virginia] said he apprehended the meaning of the words to be, that "Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law." … [T]he State[s] … seemed to entertain an opinion that under the clause of the Constitution. … it enabled them [Congress] to make laws of such a nature as might … establish a national religion; to prevent these effects he presumed the amendment was intended. … Mr. Madison thought if the word "National" was inserted before religion, it would satisfy the minds of honorable gentlemen. … He thought if the word "national" was introduced, it would point the amendment directly to the object it was intended to prevent.&lt;ref&gt;''Debates and Proceedings in the Congress of the United States'' (Washington, D.C.: Gales &amp; Seaton, 1834, Vol. I pp. 757–59, August 15, 1789&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Madison contended "Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions43.html |title=James Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments |publisher=Press-pubs.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later he wrote of "total separation of the church from the state."&lt;ref&gt;(March 2, 1819 letter to [[Robert Walsh (diplomat)|Robert Walsh]]), {{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Frank|title=The founding fathers and the place of religion in America|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2003|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1qse4fZ6eQgC&amp;pg=PA288 288]|isbn=978-0-691-08829-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qse4fZ6eQgC|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion &amp; Govt in the Constitution of the United States", Madison wrote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/jm/18191213_monopolies.htm|title=Monopolies Perpetuities Corporations – Ecclesiastical Endowments|first=James|last=Madison|publisher=constitution.org|accessdate=2008-06-16|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he declared, "practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;(1811 letter to Baptist Churches)&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Edward Livingston]] Madison further expanded,

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts. do better without Kings &amp; Nobles than with them. The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Govt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reachandteach.com/content/article.php?story=20030829111914471 |title=Madison's letter to Edward Livingston, July 10, 1822 |publisher=Reachandteach.com |date=2003-08-28 |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

[[File:Thomas Jefferson's Grave Site.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Jefferson]]'s tombstone.  The inscription, as he stipulated, reads, "Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author of ... the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom|Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom]] ...."]]
This attitude is further reflected in the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], originally authored by Jefferson and championed by Madison, and guaranteeing that no one may be compelled to finance any religion or denomination.

{{quote|… no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Maclear, ''Church and state in the modern age: a documentary history'' (1995) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Under the [[United States Constitution]], the treatment of religion by the government is broken into two clauses: the [[establishment clause]] and the [[free exercise clause]].  Both are discussed in regard to whether certain state actions would amount to an impermissible government establishment of religion.

The phrase was also mentioned in an eloquent letter written by President [[John Tyler]] on July 10, 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler wrote, "The United States have adventured upon a great and noble experiment, which is believed to have been hazarded in the absence of all previous precedent – that of total separation of Church and State. No religious establishment by law exists among us. The conscience is left free from all restraint and each is permitted to worship his Maker after his own judgment. The offices of the Government are open alike to all. No tithes are levied to support an established Hierarchy, nor is the fallible judgment of man set up as the sure and infallible creed of faith. The Mahommedan, if he will to come among us would have the privilege guaranteed to him by the constitution to worship according to the Koran; and the East Indian might erect a shrine to Brahma if it so pleased him. Such is the spirit of toleration inculcated by our political Institutions . … The Hebrew persecuted and down trodden in other regions takes up his abode among us with none to make him afraid . … and the Aegis of the Government is over him to defend and protect him. Such is the great experiment which we have cried, and such are the happy fruits which have resulted from it; our system of free government would be imperfect without it.") quoted in Nicole Guétin, ''Religious ideology in American politics: a history'' (2009) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960 presidential campaign the potential influence of the Catholic Church on John F. Kennedy's presidency was raised. If elected, it would be the first time that a Catholic would occupy the highest office in the United States. [[John F. Kennedy]], in his [[s:Address of Senator John F. Kennedy to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association|Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association]] on 12 September 1960, addressed the question directly, saying,

{{quote|I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute – where no Catholic prelate would tell the President (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote – where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference – and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the President who might appoint him or the people who might elect him. I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish – where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source – where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials – and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all. […] I do not speak for my church on public matters – and the church does not speak for me. Whatever issue may come before me as President – on birth control, divorce, censorship, gambling or any other subject – I will make my decision in accordance with these views, in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be the national interest, and without regard to outside religious pressures or dictates. And no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise. But if the time should ever come – and I do not concede any conflict to be even remotely possible – when my office would require me to either violate my conscience or violate the national interest, then I would resign the office; and I hope any conscientious public servant would do the same.}}

The United States Supreme Court has referenced the separation of church and state metaphor more than 25 times, though not always fully embracing the principle, saying "the metaphor itself is not a wholly accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists between church and state".&lt;ref&gt;* See [http://supreme.justia.com/us/465/668/case.html ''Lynch v. Donnelly'', 465 U.S. 668, 673] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025052330/http://supreme.justia.com/us/465/668/case.html |date=October 25, 2011 }} (1984): "The concept of a 'wall' of separation is a useful figure of speech probably deriving from views of Thomas Jefferson. . . . [b]ut the metaphor itself is not a wholly accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists between church and state."

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yet, despite Madison's admonition and the 'sweep of the absolute prohibitions' of the Clauses, this Nation's history has not been one of entirely sanitized separation between Church and State. It has never been thought either possible or desirable to enforce a regime of total separation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court used the phrase again by Justice Hugo Black in 1947 in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education|Everson]]''. In a minority opinion in ''[[Wallace v. Jaffree]]'', Justice Rehnquist presented the view that the establishment clause was intended to protect local establishments of religion from federal interference.  Rehnquist made numerous citations of cases that rebutted the idea of a total wall of separation between Church and State. A result of such reasoning was Supreme Court support for government payments to faith-based community projects. [[Justice Scalia]] has criticized the metaphor as a bulldozer removing religion from American public life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lee v. Weisman]], {{ussc|505|577|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pledge of Allegiance====
Critics of the American [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] have argued that the use of the phrase "under God" violates the separation of church and state. While the pledge was created by [[Francis Bellamy]] in 1891, in 1954, the [[Knights of Columbus]], a Catholic organization, campaigned with other groups to have the words "under God" added to the pledge. On June 14, 1954, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] signed the bill to make the addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-man-who-wrote-the-pledge-of-allegiance-93907224/|title=The Man Who Wrote the Pledge of Allegiance|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, critics have challenged the existence of the phrase in the Pledge. In 2004, an atheist man challenged a Californian law which required students to recite the pledge. He said the law violated his daughter's right to free speech. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the school system in ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'', mainly due to the fact that the father could not claim sufficient custody of the child over his ex-wife who was the legal guardian. Additionally, the Supreme Court stated that teachers leading students in the pledge was constitutional, and therefore the pledge should stay the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-latest-controversy-about-under-god-in-the-pledge-of-allegiance|title=The history of legal challenges to the Pledge of Allegiance - National Constitution Center|website=[[National Constitution Center]] – constitutioncenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{further|Christian state|Christian democracy|Christian Reconstructionism}}

Historically, the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] have deemed a close relationship between church and state desirable wherever possible. The Catholic Church, in addition, teaches that states have a duty to recognize the Catholic faith officially and in its laws and mores, if such states' populations are or become predominantly Catholic. The Orthodox churches have historically at times formed a "[[symphonia]]" with the state, whether de jure or de facto.
On the other hand, while some Protestants hold views similar to those above, some [[Protestant]]s refuse to vote, carry arms, or participate in civil government in any way, often leading to their persecution, as happened to [[Anabaptist]]s, their descendants including the [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]], and [[Quakers]], in the 20th Century. Anabaptist and [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witnesses]], in many countries, believing by not participating they are closer to the [[Kingdom of God]], since "[[Jesus]] answered ([[Pilate]]), 'My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight (to defend him).' " – [[John 18]]:36. For them, the term "[[Christian nation]]" cannot be a valid governmental position, leaving only Christian people, possibly in Christian communities, beyond which are the "things which are Caesar's" – [[Matthew 22:21]].

==== Methodism====
In its section on National Reform, the ''Book of Discipline'' of the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]] states, with respect to Church and state relations:&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=English|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WMC1896"/&gt;

{{quote|It shall be the duty of the ministers and members of the Wesleyan Methodist Connection to use their influence in every feasible manner in favor of a more complete recognition of the authority of Almighty God, in the secular and civil relations, both of society and of government, and the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ as King of nations as well as King of saints.&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMC1896"/&gt;}}

As such, the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Church advocates for Bible reading in public schools, chaplaincies in the Armed Forces and in Congress, [[blue law]]s (reflecting historic Methodist belief in [[Sunday Sabbatarianism]]), and [[Christian amendment|amendments that advance the recognition of God]].&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMC1896"&gt;{{cite book|title=Discipline of the Wesleyan Methodist Church of America|accessdate=28 July 2017|year=1896|publisher=Wesleyan Methodist Church|language=English|pages=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reformed====
The Reformed tradition of Christianity ([[Congregationalist]], [[Continental Reformed]], [[Presbyterian]] denominations) have also addressed the issue of the relationship between the Church and state. In its 1870 [[Presbyterian polity#General assembly|General Assembly]], the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States]] stated:&lt;ref name="Thompson1902"/&gt; 

{{quote|We should regard the successful attempt to expel all religious instruction and influence from our public schools as an evil of the first magnitude. Nor do we see how this can be done without inflicting a deadly wound upon the intellectual and moral life of the nation…We look upon the state as an ordinance of God, and not a mere creature of the popular will; and, under its high responsibility to the Supreme Ruler of the world, we hold it to be both its right and bound duty to educate its children in those elementary principles of knowledge and virtue which are essential to its own security and well-being. The union of church and state is indeed against our American theory and constitutions of government; but the most intimate union of the state with the saving and conservative forces of Christianity is one of the oldest customs of the country, and has always ranked a vital article of our political faith.&lt;ref name="Thompson1902"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert Ellis |title=The American Church History Series: A History of the Presbyterian Churches|accessdate=28 July 2017|year=1902|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|language=English|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Roman Catholicism====
The first full articulation of the Catholic doctrine on the principles of the relationship of the [[Catholic Church]] to the state (at the time, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) is contained in the document [[Famuli vestrae pietatis]], written by [[Pope Gelasius I]] to the Emperor, which states that the Church and the state should work together in society, that the state should recognize the Church's role in society, with the Church holding superiority in moral matters and the state having superiority in temporal matters. Monsignor John A. Ryan speaks of this Catholic doctrine thusly: "If there is only one true religion, and if its possession is the most important good in life, for states as well as individuals, then the public profession, protection, and promotion of this religion, and the legal prohibition of all direct assaults upon it, becomes one of the most obvious and fundamental duties of the state. For it is the business of the state to safeguard and promote human welfare in all departments of life." ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'' ("Joy and Hope"), the 1965 Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, noted that  "... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel."&lt;ref name=gaudium&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|author=Pope Paul VI|title=Gaudium et Spes|at=§4,|date=7 December 1965|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411023509/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html |archive-date=April 11, 2011|ref={{SfnRef|Gaudium et Spes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Church recognized that the realities of secularization and pluralism exist despite the traditional teaching on confessional statehood. Because of this reality of secularisation, it also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the secular world, viewing the laity as much-needed agents of change in order to bring about a transformation of society more in line with Catholic teaching. "This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.".{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

''Apostolicam Actuositatem'', the Second Vatican Council's "Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity", was issued 18 November 1965. The purpose of this document was to encourage and guide lay people in their Christian service. "Since the laity, in accordance with their state of life, live in the midst of the world and its concerns, they are called by God to exercise their apostolate in the world like leaven, with the ardor of the spirit of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19651118_apostolicam-actuositatem_en.html Pope Paul VI.

The [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic teaching]] in ''[[Dignitatis Humanae]]'', the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s Declaration on Religious Freedom (1986), states that all people are entitled to a degree of religious freedom as long as public order is not disturbed and that constitutional law should recognize such freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Calo, Zachary A., [http://www4.samford.edu/lillyhumanrights/papers/Calo_Catholic.pdf Catholic Social Thought, Political Liberalism, and the Idea of Human Rights] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621203728/http://www4.samford.edu/lillyhumanrights/papers/Calo_Catholic.pdf |date=June 21, 2010 }}, pp. 18–19, Samford University, November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; "If, in view of peculiar circumstances obtaining among peoples, special civil recognition is given to one religious community in the constitutional order of society, it is at the same time imperative that the right of all citizens and religious communities to religious freedom should be recognized and made effective in practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html Pope Paul VI.

The traditional teaching of the duty of society towards the Church in a Catholic-majority nation is [[Christendom|establishment of Catholicism as the state religion]]. This doctrine is further declared in the current edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, number 2105.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1993 edition, http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church takes the position that the Church itself has a proper role in guiding and informing consciences, explaining the [[natural law]], and judging the moral integrity of the state, thereby serving as check to the power of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Grasso, Kenneth L. and  Robert P. Hunt, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gRNcvjNxXfYC&amp;dq Catholicism and religious freedom: contemporary reflections on Vatican II's declaration on religious liberty] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520111726/https://books.google.com/books?id=gRNcvjNxXfYC&amp;dq |date=May 20, 2016 }}'', p. 6, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006
&lt;/ref&gt; The Church teaches that the right of individuals to religious freedom (enshrined in the U.S.'s "[[Free Exercise Clause]]") is sound, and, all other things being equal, ideally the Church would be the established religion of the state, without, however coercing any individual to embrace the Catholic religion. Still, it also recognizes that it would not always be prudent in all states to immediately mandate the Catholic religion as the official religion of the state, most especially in states in which Catholicism has not yet become the religion of the overwhelming majority.

Catholic philosopher Thomas Storck argues that, once a society becomes "Catholicised" and adopts the Church as the state religion, it is further morally bound: "'the just requirements of public order' vary considerably between a Catholic state and a religiously neutral state. If a neutral state can prohibit polygamy, even though it is a restriction on religious freedom, then a Catholic state can likewise restrict the public activity of non-Catholic groups. "The just requirements of public order" can be understood only in the context of a people's traditions and modes of living, and in a Catholic society would necessarily include that social unity based upon a recognition of the Catholic Church as the religion of society, and the consequent exclusion of all other religions from public life. Western secular democracies, committed to freedom of religion for all sects, find no contradiction in proscribing polygamy, although some religions permit it, because its practice is contrary to the traditions and mores of these nations. A Catholic country can certainly similarly maintain its own manner of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/ANSWERS/FR89103.HTM |title=THE PROBLEM OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY: A NEW PROPOSAL|accessdate=2015-06-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310131008/https://www.ewtn.com/library/ANSWERS/FR89103.HTM |archivedate=2016-03-10 |df= |work="Faith &amp; Reason". Christendom Press|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If, under consideration of historical circumstances among peoples, special civil recognition is given to one religious community in the constitutional order of a society, it is necessary at the same time that the right of all citizens and religious communities to religious freedom should be acknowledged and maintained.&lt;ref&gt;

Leon Hooper, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=T8FKWmD_pKMC&amp;pg Religious liberty: Catholic struggles with pluralism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423214619/https://books.google.com/books?id=T8FKWmD_pKMC&amp;pg |date=April 23, 2016 }}'', pp. 213–14, Westminster John Knox Press, 1993

The Church takes stances on current political issues, and tries to influence legislation on matters it considers relevant. For example, the Catholic bishops in the United States adopted a plan in the 1970s calling for efforts aimed at a [[Constitutional amendment]] providing "[[abortion law|protection for the unborn]] child to the maximum degree possible".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |last=Curran |first=Charles |url=http://ncronline.org/news/politics/us-catholic-bishops-and-abortion-legislation |title=National Catholic Reporter online, 29 November 2010 |publisher=Ncronline.org |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French separation of 1905 and the Spanish separation of 1931 have been characterized as the two most hostile of the twentieth century, although the current church-state relations in both countries are considered generally friendly.&lt;ref name="Arguing Comparative Politics" /&gt;  Nevertheless, France's former President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] at the beginning of his term, considered his country's current state of affairs a "negative laïcité" and wanted to develop a "positive laïcité" more open to religion.&lt;ref name="christiantoday.com" /&gt; The concerns of the state toward religion have been seen by some as one cause of the civil war in [[Spanish Civil War#Constitution of 1931|Spain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/spainport2.htm |title=A History of Spain and Portugal, Volume 2 |chapter=Ch. 25: "The Second Spanish Republic" |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |author=Payne, Stanley G. |year=1973 |page=632 |accessdate=2009-07-11 |archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20120712231942/http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/spainport2.htm |archivedate=July 12, 2012}}{{webarchive|format=addlarchives|url=https://archive.fo/20120720003512/http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne25.htm|date=July 20, 2012 |title=Chapter 25}}.

The French Catholic philosopher and drafter of the ''[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]'',  [[Jacques Maritain]], noted the distinction between the models found in France and in the mid-twentieth century United States.&lt;ref name="Christ And Culture Revisited"&gt;Carson, D. A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pIwE74bxvpAC&amp;dq ''Christ And Culture Revisited''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512113715/https://books.google.com/books?id=pIwE74bxvpAC&amp;dq |date=May 12, 2016 }}, p. 189, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
He considered the U.S. model of that time to be more amicable because it had both "sharp distinction and actual cooperation" between church and state, what he called a "historical treasure" and admonished the United States, "Please to God that you keep it carefully, and do not let your concept of separation veer round to the European one."&lt;ref name="Christ And Culture Revisited" /&gt; [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], another French observer tended to make the same distinction, "In the U.S., from the beginning, politics and religion were in accord, and they have not ceased to be so since."&lt;ref&gt;de Tocqueville, Alexis, ''Democracy in America'', edited and translated by Harvey Mansfield and Delba Winthrop, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8671">'''The Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission of Nigeria''', also known as the '''Oputa Panel''', is a commission that was developed following the collapse of the [[Nigerian military juntas of 1966–79 and 1983–98|military dictatorship that controlled Nigeria until 1998]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=hfZYrgEACAAJ&amp;printsec=%20%20frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=nigeria&amp;f=false|title=Truth Commissions: Memory, Power, and Legitimacy|last=Bakiner|first=Onur|date=2016|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812247626|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by [[Olusegun Obasanjo|Olosegun Obasanjo]], the newly elected President of Nigeria, in 1999.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usip.org/publications/1999/06/truth-commission-nigeria|title=Truth Commission: Nigeria|website=United States Institute of Peace|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mandate was to investigate human rights during the period of military rule from 1984 to 1999.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayner|first=Priscilla B.|date=2010-09-13|title=Unspeakable Truths|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203867822|doi=10.4324/9780203867822}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of reconciliation, the commission also worked towards unifying communities previously in conflict.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nnamani|first=S.

Its report was not released to the public until 2005, when it was published by two activist groups, the Nigerian Democratic Movement and Nigeria-based Civil Society Forum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
== Background ==
Nigeria was under British rule up until 1960.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After independence, there were many [[Communal conflicts in Nigeria|internal conflicts]] within the country that limited Nigeria’s ability to consolidate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The country was divided along religious and ethnic lines which led to mass killings and eventually, a full [[Nigerian Civil War|civil war]] that would last until 1970.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With Nigeria under the control of a military dictatorship following the [[1966 Nigerian coup d'état]], other coups continued to take place.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  General [[Ibrahim Babangida|Ibrahim Babangida,]]  the head of the military juntas beginning in 1985, was forced out of power in 1993 due to the riots throughout the country following his decision to cancel the [[Nigerian presidential election, 1993|election]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under Defense Minister [[Sani Abacha]], who took his place as president, violence continued. Abacha was accused of extensive human rights violations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After his death in 1998, an [[Nigerian presidential election, 1999|election]] saw Olusegun Obasanjo take power.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Obasanjo embarked on reforms including the creation of the [[The Human Rights Violation Investigation Commission of Nigeria|Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
== Mandate ==
When first called into action, The Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission's main focus was human rights violations and cases of abuse under Nigeria's military regime between 1984 and 1999.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The commission was also mandated to work towards reconciliation of the various communities and groups of people present in Nigeria that were in conflict with one another when under the military regime.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Its investigation was to be carried out and completed over the course of three months.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Over a period of time however, the commission shifted its main focus to "gross human rights violations" and demanded more time to carry out its investigation and to extend the period under investigation to include the events which occurred from 1966 to 1990.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

== Process ==
After this commission was created, it began with the process of taking into account the experiences of victims of the military regime.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There was an outpouring of stories from Nigerians who explained the types or violations and abuses that they faced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The commission received up to 10,000 victim recollections with most reporting unfair treatment within the economic domain -- more specifically, unfair treatment in the work place.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Public hearings spanned more than a year, bringing the stories of the victims and perpetrators forward to the public as these hearings were televised on every occasion.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Only 150 out of the 10,000 recollections of abuse that they received from victims were heard.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Limited funds meant that investigation into the human rights violations was limited to the public hearings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The commission’s investigation consisted of 

* acquiring information about human rights violations through recollections provided by the victims 
* bringing to light the identity of those who were involved in committing these crimes, and 
* gaining a better understanding as to why these crimes were committed in the first place.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The commission also played a role in establishing peace agreements between various Nigerian communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;!-- Lots of detail in this section, which is appreciated. If I could suggest one possible improvement, it would be to elaborate on how the victim testimonies were taken (if the information is available, of course). Were they given orally and transcribed by an employee of the Commission? --&gt;

== Findings and recommendations  ==
The commission produced a report which concluded that the military’s control over the politics of Nigeria was one of the primary reasons for human rights violations and for continued  political, social, and economic troubles in Nigeria.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/934006288|title=The Justice versus Reconciliation Dichotomy in the Struggle Against Gross Human Rights Violations: The Nigerian Experience|last=Benson|first=Hassan, Idayat Olugbuo,|date=2015-10-28|publisher=CODESRIA|oclc=934006288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission also concluded that those who held positions of power, those who were a part of the military, and upper-class Nigerian citizens worked together to carry out the military coups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, the commission concluded that the Ministry of Justice played a role in protecting those who were responsible for committing human rights violations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The commission recommended that victims be given [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, it recommended that Nigeria focus on eliminating  corruption, especially corruption within government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
== Follow-up ==
The Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission of Nigeria submitted its final report to the president in 2002, but he did not bring the report to public attention.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This decision reportedly was because of a case brought to the Supreme Court in 2003 by two former military leaders against the commission over its power to make them testify.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  [[Supreme Court of Nigeria|Nigeria's Supreme Court]] ruled that the power to hold public hearings lies with the state governments of Nigeria and not the federal government, according to the [[Constitution of Nigeria|Constitution of 1999]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; After this case, it was not until 2005 that two activist groups, the Nigerian Democratic Movement and Nigeria-based Civil Society Forum, finally published the commission’s report online.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The report was already in the public realm, but the government limited its availability and accessibility.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Subsequently, state governments in Nigeria began to establish their own truth and reconciliation commissions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The federal government has not implemented the commission;s recommendations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following its reconciliation processes, the commission was successful in reconciling communities in Maroko village, in the [[Ogun State]], and the various groups in Ogoni Island.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
