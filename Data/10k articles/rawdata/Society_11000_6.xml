      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="540">The '''Ahomes''' were a native people resident around the mouth of the [[Fuerte River]] at the time they first came into contact with the Spanish. The Ahomes were brought under Spanish military control and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] religious leadership from 1600 to no later than 1609, and largely were merged into the culture of [[New Spain]] after this time.

'''Albert Henry Woolson''' (February 11, 1850 – August 2, 1956) was the [[Last surviving United States war veterans|last surviving]] member of the [[Union Army]] who served in the [[American Civil War]]. He was also the last surviving Civil War veteran on either side whose status is undisputed. At least three men who followed him in death claimed to be Confederate veterans, but one has been debunked and the other two are unverified. The last surviving Union soldier to see combat was [[James Hard]] (1841–1953).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nycivilwar.us/jahard.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Woolson was born in [[Antwerp (town), New York|Antwerp]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to Willard P. Woolson (1811–1862) and Caroline Baldwin (ca. 1822–unknown).&lt;ref&gt;https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/XRFH-N3P&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to be born on February 11, 1847, but his entry in the [[1850 United States Census]] lists him as born in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:1850UnitedStatesFederalCensus 312130447.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some references still use the self-reported 1847 birth year.&lt;/ref&gt; Entries in the later census records and in the 1905 Minnesota State Census support the conclusion that he was born in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;For example, 1860 Census for town of Antwerp, Jefferson County, NY lists him as age 11. The 1910 census for Duluth, St. Louis County, Minnesota, Enumeration District 180, list him as age 60, and the 1905 Minnesota State Census for the town of Winnebago, in Faribault County, lists him as age 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

His father, Willard Woolson, enlisted in the [[Union Army]]. Willard was wounded at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and was transported to an Army hospital in [[Windom, Minnesota|Windom]], [[Minnesota]], where he would die of his wounds. Albert and his mother moved to Windom to accompany Willard. Albert enlisted as a [[drummer#Military|drummer boy]] in Company C, [[1st Minnesota Heavy Artillery Regiment]] on October 10, 1864, becoming the company's drummer. However, the company never saw action, and Albert Woolson was discharged on September 7, 1865.

Woolson returned to Minnesota, where he lived the rest of his life. He was a [[carpenter]] and later a member of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (G.A.R.), a powerful political organization made up of Civil War veterans where he became senior vice commander in chief in 1953.

In his final days, he lived at 215 East Fifth Street in [[Duluth, Minnesota]]. Woolson died at [[St. Luke's Hospital (Duluth, Minnesota)|St. Luke's Hospital]] in Duluth on August 2, 1956, at what was then thought to be the [[Centenarian|age of 109]], of a "recurring lung congestion condition". He was twice widowed and was survived by six daughters and two sons. Woolson was buried with full military honors by the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] at [[Park Hill Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Woolson, Last Union Veteran, Is Buried After Military Rites |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/08/07/archives/woolson-last-union-veteran-is-buried-after-military-rites.html |quote=Albert Woolson, the 109-year old [sic] Civil War Union Army veteran who outlived all of his comrades, went to his grave today as a soldier. |agency=[[United Press]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 7, 1956 |accessdate=2012-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his death, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The American people have lost the last personal link with the Union Army ... His passing brings sorrow to the hearts of all of us who cherished the memory of the brave men on both sides of the War Between the States.&lt;ref name=stpete1956&gt;{{cite news|title=Last 24 Hours|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F_BRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LHYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7079,685655|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=3 August 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
Woolson and fellow drummer-boy Frank Mayer marched together, both aged 99, in the Memorial Day Parade in May 1949, to lay a wreath at the tomb of General Grant in New York City.

[[Life magazine|''Life'' magazine]] ran a seven-page article upon the death of Albert Woolson, in the August 20, 1956, issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Life Magazine|title=The Death of the Last Union Soldier and of an Era|date=1956-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article included much information about the G.A.R., with pictures or drawings of several encampments (conventions). Also included are photos of the last three living Confederate soldiers (status and age disputed): [[William Lundy]], 108; [[Walter Williams (centenarian)|Walter Williams]], 113; and [[John B. Salling|John Salling]], 110.

In mid-2006, new census research indicated that Albert Woolson was actually only 106 years old, being listed as less than one year old in the 1850 census. Previous research in 1991 had suggested he was only a year younger than claimed (108 instead of 109), although this does not affect his veteran status.

After his death, the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] was dissolved because Woolson was its last surviving member.

The 2011–12 ''Minnesota Legislative Manual'' was dedicated to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Dedication of Blue Book|pages=ii–iii|last=Ritchie|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Ritchie|title=2011–12 Minnesota Legislative Manual|publisher=Minnesota Office of Secretary of State|editor=Minnesota Office of Secretary of State|year=2011|issn=1524-8038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 a monument of Woolson was erected in [[Gettysburg Battlefield|Gettysburg]] as a memorial to the Grand Army of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gettysburg.stonesentinels.com/Individuals/Woolson.php&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="746">'''Anatopia''' was a land [[squatting|squat]] in [[Papenburg]], [[Germany]]. The site was squatted July 4 1991 and evicted January 7 1995 after a long struggle. It was on a location where the [[Daimler-Benz]] automobile company ([[Mercedes-Benz]]) intended to build a test track (12 km long, 3 km wide) and became the focus of anti-Mercedes protests throughout Germany. The squatters lived a [[vegan]] lifestyle, eating communally every night.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eco-action.org/dod/no5/world_mercedes.htm Anatopia article from Do or Die magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, the post-2003 [[Iraq War]] and the [[Syrian Civil War]], which began in 2011, have displaced much of the remaining Assyrian community from their homeland as a result of ethnic and religious persecution at the hands of [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremists]]. Of the one million or more Iraqis reported by the [[United Nations]] to have fled Iraq since the [[History of Iraq (2003–11)|occupation]], nearly 40% were Assyrians even though Assyrians accounted for only around 3% of the pre-war Iraqi demography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Assyrian Christians 'Most Vulnerable Population' in Iraq |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20061205/23863.htm |work=The Christian Post |accessdate=2006-12-05 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121208143126/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20061205/23863.htm| archivedate=8 December 2012 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Assyrian Report on CWN"&gt;{{cite news |title=Iraq's Christian community, fights for its survival |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaNG6OF3pQE |publisher=Christian World News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Gov't Watchdog Urges Protection for Iraq's Assyrian Christians |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070314/26312_U.S._Gov't_Watchdog_Urges_Protection_for_Iraq's_Assyrian_Christians.htm |work=The Christian Post |accessdate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2013 report by a [[Chaldean Syriac Assyrian Popular Council]] official, it is estimated that only 300,000 Assyrians remain in Iraq.&lt;ref name="ishtartv.com" /&gt;

Because of the emergence of ISIL and the taking over of much of the Assyrian homeland by the terror group, another major wave of Assyrian displacement has taken place. ISIL was driven out from the Assyrian villages in the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabour River]] Valley and the areas surrounding the city of [[Al-Hasakah]] in Syria by 2015, and from the [[Nineveh plains]] in Iraq by 2017. Since the expulsion of ISIL, the [[Nineveh plains]] have been divided into Iraqi and Kurdish-controlled zones, with Assyrian militias on both sides. In Gozarto/Northern Syria, Assyrian groups have been taking part both politically and militarily in the Kurdish-dominated but multiethnic [[Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]] project.

[[Assyrian homeland|Assyria]] is the homeland of the Assyrian people; it is located in the ancient Near East. In prehistoric times, the region that was to become known as Assyria (and Subartu) was home to [[Neanderthal]]s such as the remains of those which have been found at the [[Shanidar Cave]]. The earliest [[Neolithic]] sites in Assyria belonged to the [[Jarmo]] culture c. 7100 BC and [[Tell Hassuna]], the centre of the [[Hassuna culture]], c. 6000 BC.

The history of Assyria begins with the formation of the city of [[Assur]] perhaps as early as the 25th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[List of Assyrian kings|Assyrian king list]] records kings dating from the 25th century BC onwards, the earliest being [[Tudiya]], who was a contemporary of [[Ibrium]] of [[Ebla]]. However, many of these early kings would have been local rulers, and from the late 24th century BC to the early 22nd century BC, they were usually subjects of the [[Akkadian Empire]].

During the early [[Bronze Age]] period, [[Sargon of Akkad]] united all the native [[Semitic language|Semitic]]-speaking peoples and the [[Sumer]]ians of [[Mesopotamia]] (including the Assyrians) under the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2335–2154 BC). The cities of Assur and [[Nineveh]] (modern day [[Mosul]]), which was the oldest and largest city of the ancient Assyrian empire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nineveh |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Nineveh-ancient-city-Iraq |publisher=Max Mallowan}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with a number of other towns and cities, existed as early as the 25th century BC, although they appear to have been Sumerian-ruled administrative centres at this time, rather than independent states. The Sumerians were eventually absorbed into the Akkadian (Assyro-Babylonian) population.&lt;ref name="Deutscher"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20–21|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditions of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], they are descended from [[Abraham]]'s grandson ([[Dedanites|Dedan]] son of [[Jokshan]]), progenitor of the ancient Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 25:3&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no historical basis for the biblical assertion whatsoever; there is no mention in Assyrian records (which date as far back as the 25th century BC). [[Ashur-uballit I]] overthrew the [[Mitanni]] c. 1365 BC, and the Assyrians benefited from this development by taking control of the eastern portion of Mitanni territory, and later also annexing [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Babylonia]]n, [[Amorite]] and [[Hurrian]] territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ashur|url=http://www.ancient.eu/ashur/|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian people, after the fall of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in 609 BC were under the control of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] and later the [[Persian Empire]], which consumed the entire [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian or "Chaldean" Empire]] in 539 BC. Assyrians became [[front line]] soldiers for the Persian Empire under [[Xerxes I]], playing a major role in the [[Battle of Marathon]] under [[Darius I]] in 490 BC.&lt;ref&gt;"Artifacts show rivals Athens and Sparta", Yahoo News, December 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the influx of foreign elements, the presence of Assyrians is confirmed by the worship of the god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]]; references to the name survive into the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=32HS_jUi4NEC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=parthian+rule+over+the+assyrians#v=onepage&amp;q=parthian%20rule%20over%20the%20assyrians&amp;f=false|title=Ancient and Modern Assyrians: A Scientific Analysis|accessdate=16 December 2014|isbn=9781465316295|last1=Yana|first1=George V.|date=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks, Parthians, and Romans had a rather low-level of integration with the local population in Mesopotamia, which allowed their cultures to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Olmatead, ''History of the Persian Empire'', Chicago University Press, 1959, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdoms of [[Osrhoene]], [[Adiabene]], Hatra and Assur, which were under [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] overlordship, had an Assyrian identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National and Ethnic Identity in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Assyrian Identity in Post-Empire Times|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/149115268/National-Identity-in-Neo-Assyrian-Empire|publisher=Simo Parpola|pages=20|quote=When the Seleucid Empire disintegrated at the end of the second century BC, its western remnants were annexed to Rome, while several semi-independent kingdoms of decidedly Assyrian stamp and/or identity (Osrhoene, Adiabene, Hatra, Assur) popped up in the East under Parthian overlordship. These kingdoms perpetuated Assyrian cultural and religious traditions but were also receptive to Christianity, whose central ideas were in line with the central tenets of Assyrian religion and ideology, and which was felt as intrinsically Assyrian because of the Aramaic affinity of Jesus and the disciples.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Language====
Emerging in [[Sumer]] c. 3500 BC, [[cuneiform writing]] began as a system of [[pictograms]]. Around 3000 BC, the pictorial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of characters in use grew smaller. The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (Babylonian and Assyrian) and [[Hittite language|Hittite]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oimp32.pdf ''Visible Language. Inventions of Writing in the Ancient Middle East and Beyond''], Oriental Institute Museum Publications, 32, Chicago: University of Chicago, p. 13, {{ISBN|978-1-885923-76-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kültepe texts]], which were written in Old Assyrian, is the site of discovery of the earliest traces of the [[Hittite language]], and the earliest attestation of any [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]], dated to the 20th century BC. Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of [[Anatolia]] rather than of Assyria, but the use of both [[cuneiform]] and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence. To date, over 20,000 cuneiform tablets have been recovered from the site.&lt;ref&gt;E.

Veenhof, Ankara Kultepe Tabletleri V, Turk Tarih Kurumu, 2010, {{ISBN|978-975-16-2235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1700 BC and onward, the [[Sumerian language]] was preserved by the ancient [[Babylonia]]ns and Assyrians only as a [[liturgical language|liturgical]] and [[classical language]] for religious, artistic and scholarly purposes.&lt;ref name="woods"&gt;Woods C. 2006 "Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian".

From the 1st century BC, Assyria was the theatre of the protracted [[Roman–Persian Wars]]. Much of the region would become the Roman province of [[Assyria (Roman province)|Assyria]] from 116 to 118 AD following the conquests of Trajan, but after a Parthian-inspired Assyrian rebellion, the new emperor [[Hadrian]] withdrew from Assyria and its neighboring provinces in 118 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hadrian |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hadrian |publisher=G.W.

The Assyrians were Christianized in the first to third centuries in [[Roman Syria]] and Roman Assyria. The population of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian province]] of [[Asōristān]] was a mixed one, composed of Assyrians, [[Arameans]] in the far south and the western deserts, and [[Persian people|Persians]].&lt;ref name="RP"&gt;{{cite book|last=Etheredge|first=Laura|title=Iraq|year=2011|publisher=[[Rosen Publishing]]|isbn=9781615303045|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greeks|Greek]] element in the cities, still strong during the [[Parthian Empire]], ceased to be ethnically distinct in Sasanian times. The majority of the population were [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic speakers]].

Along with the Arameans, [[Armenians]], Greeks, and [[Nabataeans]], the Assyrians were among the first people to convert to [[Christianity]] and spread [[Eastern Christianity]] to the [[Far East]]. The [[Council of Seleucia]] of c. 325 dealt with jurisdictional conflicts among the leading bishops. They were divided by the [[Nestorian Schism]] in the 5th century, and from the 8th century, they became a [[minority religion]] following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]].

At the subsequent [[Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] of 410, the Christian communities of [[Mesopotamia]] renounced all subjection to Antioch and the "Western" bishops and the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] (modern [[al-Mada'in]]) assumed the rank of [[Catholicos]]. Whereas Latin and Greek Christian cultures became protected by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s, respectively, Assyrian Christianity often found itself marginalized and persecuted.
[[File:Church of Saint John the Arab.jpg|thumb|225px|A 6th century church, St. John the Arab, in [[Sirnak Province]], Turkey ([[Andaç, Uludere|Geramon]]).]]
During the 5th century, these schisms divided the church into separate Nestorian and [[Monophysitism|Monophysite]] denominations which developed distinct dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Syriac language |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Syriac-language |publisher=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of [[Syriac Christianity]], eastern Aramaic enjoyed a renaissance as a classical language in the 2nd to 8th centuries, and the modern Assyrian people continue to speak eastern [[Neo-Aramaic languages]]. Assyria continued to exist as a geopolitical entity until the Arab-Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century.

The Assyrians initially experienced some periods of religious and cultural freedom interspersed with periods of severe religious and ethnic persecution after the 7th century [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. Assyrians contributed to Islamic civilizations during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]]s by translating works of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] to Syriac and afterwards to [[Arabic]].

Indigenous Assyrians became second-class citizens (''[[dhimmi]]'') in a greater Arab Islamic state, and those who resisted Arabisation and conversion to Islam were subject to severe religious, ethnic and cultural discrimination, and had certain restrictions imposed upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Bennett (2005).

As non-Islamic [[proselytising]] was punishable by death under [[Sharia]], the Assyrians were forced into preaching in [[Transoxiana]], [[Central Asia]], [[India]], [[Mongolia]] and [[China]] where they established numerous churches. The [[Church of the East]] was considered to be one of the major Christian powerhouses in the world, alongside Latin Christianity in Europe and the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=Dietmar|title=Hidden Treasures And Intercultural Encounters: Studies On East Syriac Christianity In China And Central Asia|year=2009|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7f9gS40A_3IC&amp;pg=PA321|isbn=9783643500458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 7th century AD onwards Mesopotamia saw a steady influx of Arabs, [[Kurds]] and other [[Iranian peoples]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aboona|first=Hirmis|title=Assyrians, Kurds, and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire|year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AdZfWpd4YrYC&amp;pg=PR11|isbn=9781604975833}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Turkic peoples]]. Assyrians were increasingly marginalized, persecuted, and gradually became a minority in their own homeland. Conversion to Islam as a result of heavy taxation which also resulted in decreased revenue from their rulers. As a result, the new converts migrated to Muslim garrison towns nearby.

Assyrians remained dominant in Upper Mesopotamia as late as the 14th century&lt;ref&gt;According to Georges Roux and Simo Parpola&lt;/ref&gt; and the city of [[Assur|Ashur]] was still occupied by Assyrians during the Islamic period until the mid-14th century when the [[Muslim]] Turco-Mongol ruler [[Timur]] conducted a religiously motivated massacre against Assyrians. After, there were no records of Assyrians remaining in Ashur according to the archaeological and numismatic record. From this point, the Assyrian population was dramatically reduced in their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assur.de/Themen/Stadtgeschichte_Engl/body_stadtgeschichte_engl.html |title=History of Ashur |publisher=Assur.de |date= |accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 19th century, after the rise of nationalism in the [[Balkans]], the Ottomans started viewing Assyrians and other Christians in their eastern front as a potential threat. The Kurdish Emirs sought to consolidate their power by attacking Assyrian communities which were already well-established there. Scholars estimate that tens of thousands of Assyrian in the [[Hakkari]] region were [[Massacres of Badr Khan|massacred in 1843]] when [[Bedr Khan Beg]], the emir of [[Bohtan]], invaded their region.&lt;ref&gt;David Gaunt, Massacres, resistance, protectors: Muslim-Christian relations in Eastern, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4mug9LrpLKcC&amp;pg=PA32 pp. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; After a later massacre in 1846, the Ottomans were forced by the western powers into intervening in the region, and the ensuing conflict destroyed the Kurdish emirates and reasserted the Ottoman power in the area. The Assyrians were subject to the [[massacres of Diyarbakır (1895)|massacres of Diyarbakır]] soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aboona|first=Hirmis|authorlink=Hirmis Aboona|title=Assyrians, Kurds, and Ottomans: Intercommunal Relations on the Periphery of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AdZfWpd4YrYC&amp;pg=PA105|year=2008|publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=978-1-60497-583-3|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being culturally, ethnically, and linguistically distinct from their Muslim neighbors in the Middle East—the Arabs, [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Kurds]], [[Turkish people|Turks]]—the Assyrians have endured much hardship throughout their recent history as a result of religious and ethnic persecution by these groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khanbaghi|first=Aptin|title=The fire, the star and the cross: minority religions in medieval and early modern Iran|year=2006|publisher=I.B.Tauris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iAbUEaXnfEC&amp;pg=PA87|isbn=9781845110567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Syriac Christianity.svg|thumb|Aramaic language and [[Syriac Christianity]] in the Middle East and Central Asia until being largely annihilated by [[Tamerlane]] in the 14th century]]
After initially coming under the control of the [[Seljuk Empire]] and the [[Buyid dynasty]], the region eventually came under the control of the [[Mongol Empire]] after the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad]] in 1258. The Mongol khans were sympathetic with Christians and did not harm them. The most prominent among them was probably [[Isa Kelemechi]], a diplomat, astrologer, and head of the Christian affairs in [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan China]]. He spent some time in Persia under the [[Ilkhanate]]. The 14th century massacres of Timur devastated the Assyrian people. Timur's massacres and pillages of all that was Christian drastically reduced their existence. At the end of the reign of Timur, the Assyrian population had almost been eradicated in many places. Toward the end of the thirteenth century, [[Bar Hebraeus]], the noted Assyrian scholar and hierarch, found "much quietness" in his diocese in Mesopotamia. Syria’s diocese, he wrote, was "wasted."{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The region was later controlled by the in Iran-based Turkic confederations of the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] and [[Kara Koyunlu]]. Subsequently, all Assyrians, like with the rest of the ethnicities living in the former Aq Qoyunlu territories, fell into [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] hands from 1501 and on.

The Ottomans secured their control over Mesopotamia and Syria in the first half of the 17th century following the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–39)]] and the resulting [[Treaty of Zuhab]]. Non-Muslims were organised into [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]]. Syriac Christians, however, were often considered one millet alongside Armenians until the 19th century, when Nestorian, Syriac Orthodox and Chaldeans gained that right as well.&lt;ref name=kennith255&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fHtSuvaVAAoC&amp;pg=PA255 The Blackwell companion to Eastern Christianity], Kenneth Parry&lt;/ref&gt;

A religious schism amongst the Assyrians took place in the mid to late 16th century. Dissent over the hereditary succession within the Assyrian Church of the East grew until 1552, when a group of Assyrian bishops, from the northern regions of [[Amid]] and [[Salmas]], elected a priest, Mar [[Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa|Yohannan Sulaqa]], as a rival patriarch. To look for a bishop of [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] rank to consecrate him patriarch, Sulaqa traveled to the [[pope]] in Rome and entered into communion with the [[Catholic Church]]. In 1553 he was consecrated bishop and elevated to the rank of patriarch taking the name of Mar Shimun VIII. He was granted the title of "Patriarch of the Chaldeans," and his church was named the Church of ''Athura and Mosul''.&lt;ref&gt;George V.

Mar Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa returned to northern [[Mesopotamia]] in the same year and fixed his seat in Amid. Before being put to death by the partisans of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] patriarch of [[Alqosh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frazee|first=Charles A. |title=Catholics and Sultans: The Church and the Ottoman Empire 1453–1923 |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-02700-7|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}} he ordained five metropolitan bishops thus beginning a new ecclesiastical hierarchy: the patriarchal line known as the ''Shimun line''. The area of influence of this patriarchate soon moved from Amid east, fixing the See, after many places, in the isolated Assyrian village of [[Qochanis]]. Although this new church eventually drifted away from Rome by 1600 and reentered communion with the Assyrian Church, the archbishop of [[Amid]] reinstated relations with Rome in 1672, giving birth to the modern [[Chaldean Catholic Church]].

In the 1840s many of the Assyrians living in the mountains of [[Hakkari]] in the south eastern corner of the Ottoman Empire were massacred by the Kurdish emirs of Hakkari and Bohtan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aboona|first=H|author-link=Hirmis Aboona|title=Assyrians, Kurds, and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire|pages=218–219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AdZfWpd4YrYC|year=2008|publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=978-1-60497-583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major massacre of Assyrians (and Armenians) in the [[Ottoman Empire]] occurred between 1894 and 1897 by Turkish troops and their Kurdish allies during the rule of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]. The motives for these massacres were an attempt to reassert [[Pan-Islamism]] in the Ottoman Empire, resentment at the comparative wealth of the ancient indigenous Christian communities, and a fear that they would attempt to secede from the tottering Ottoman Empire. Assyrians were massacred in [[Diyarbakir]], [[Hasankeyef]], [[Sivas]] and other parts of Anatolia, by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. These attacks caused the death of over thousands of Assyrians and the forced "Ottomanisation" of the inhabitants of 245 villages. The Turkish troops looted the remains of the Assyrian settlements and these were later stolen and occupied by Kurds. Unarmed Assyrian women and children were raped, tortured and murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Courtois|first=S|title=The forgotten genocide: eastern Christians, the last Arameans|pages=105–107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whDcogCNZs4C|year=2004|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|isbn=978-1-59333-077-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyrians suffered a number of religiously and ethnically motivated massacres throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries AD,&lt;ref&gt;Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. pp. 218–219. {{ISBN|978-1-60497-583-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in the large scale [[Hamidian massacres]] of unarmed men, women and children by [[Muslim]] [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurds]] in the late 19th century at the hands of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its associated (largely [[Kurds|Kurdish]] and [[Arab]]) militias, which further greatly reduced numbers, particularly in southeastern Turkey.

The most significant recent persecution against the Assyrian population was the [[Assyrian genocide]] which occurred during the First World War. Between 275,000 and 300,000 Assyrians were estimated to have been slaughtered by the armies of the Ottoman Empire and their Kurdish allies, totalling up to two-thirds of the entire Assyrian population.

This led to a large-scale migration of Turkish-based Assyrian people into countries such as Syria, [[Iran]], and Iraq (where they were to suffer further violent assaults at the hands of the Arabs and Kurds), as well as other neighbouring countries in and around the Middle East such as [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;The Plight of Religious Minorities: Can Religious Pluralism Survive? - Page 51 by United States Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Armenian Genocide: Wartime Radicalization Or Premeditated Continuum – Page 272 edited by Richard Hovannisian&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not Even My Name: A True Story – Page 131 by Thea Halo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Political Dictionary of Modern Middle East by Agnes G. Korbani&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the [[Assyrian Genocide]] and lured by [[United Kingdom|British]] and Russian promises of an independent nation, the Assyrians led by [[Agha Petros]] and [[Malik Khoshaba]] of the Bit-[[Tyari]] tribe, fought alongside the Allies against Ottoman forces in an [[Assyrian war of independence]]. Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned the Assyrians fought successfully, scoring a number of victories over the Turks and Kurds. This situation continued until their Russian allies left the war, and Armenian resistance broke, leaving the Assyrians surrounded, isolated and cut off from lines of supply. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I.

=== Modern history ===
[[File:Assyrian refugees on wagon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Assyrian refugees on a wagon moving to a newly constructed village on the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]] river in Syria.]]
The majority of Assyrians living in what is today modern Turkey were forced to flee to either Syria or Iraq after the Turkish victory during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. In 1932, Assyrians refused to become part of the newly formed state of [[Iraq]] and instead demanded their recognition as a nation within a nation. The Assyrian leader [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] asked the [[League of Nations]] to recognize the right of the Assyrians to govern the area known as the "[[Assyrian triangle]]" in northern Iraq. During the [[French mandate]] period, some Assyrians, fleeing [[ethnic cleansing]]s in [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] during the [[Simele massacre]], established numerous villages along the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] during the 1930s.

The [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings such as [[Rab-shakeh]], Rab-talia and [[Tartan (Assyrian)|Tartan]], being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline,&lt;ref&gt;Len Dieghton, ''Blood Sweat and Tears''&lt;/ref&gt; and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds. During [[World War II]], eleven Assyrian companies saw action in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and another four served in [[Cyprus]]. The Parachute Company was attached to the [[Royal Marine Commando]] and were involved in fighting in [[Albania]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. The Assyrian Levies played a major role in subduing the pro-[[Nazi]] Iraqi forces at the battle of [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]] in 1941.

However, this cooperation with the British was viewed with suspicion by some leaders of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Iraq]]. The tension reached its peak shortly after the formal declaration of independence when hundreds of Assyrian civilians were slaughtered during the Simele Massacre by the [[Iraqi Army]] in August 1933. The events lead to the expulsion of [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] the Catholicos Patriarch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] to the United States where resided until his death in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Zubaida|first=S|title=Contested nations: Iraq and the Assyrians|journal=Nations and Nationalism|date=July 2000|volume=6|issue=3|pages=363–382|doi=10.1111/j.1354-5078.2000.00363.x|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/contestednations.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peshitta1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of His Holiness, The Assyrian Martyr, The Late Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|url=http://www.peshitta.org/initial/mareshai.html|work=Committee of the 50th Anniversary of the Patriarchate of Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|publisher=peshitta.org|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians. The regime of President [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, others were well represented in politics and the military, their towns and villages flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel, and be over represented in sports.

The [[Ba'ath Party]] seized power in [[February 1963 Iraqi coup d'état|Iraq]] and [[1963 Syrian coup d'état|Syria]] in 1963, introducing laws aimed at suppressing the Assyrian national identity via arabization policies. The giving of traditional Assyrian names was banned and Assyrian schools, political parties, churches and literature were repressed. Assyrians were heavily pressured into identifying as ''Iraqi/Syrian Christians''. Assyrians were not recognized as an ethnic group by the governments and they fostered divisions among Assyrians along religious lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs. Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox Church).&lt;ref name="UNHCR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCIS,,IRQ,,3f520de14,0.html |title=Refworld – Iraq: Information on treatment of Assyrian and Chaldean Christians |author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |work=Refworld |accessdate=18 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019062353/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CUSCIS%2C%2CIRQ%2C%2C3f520de14%2C0.html |archivedate=19 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the [[Zowaa]] movement within the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] took up armed struggle against the Iraqi government in 1982 under the leadership of [[Yonadam Kanna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zowaa.org/|title=زوعا|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then joined up with the Iraqi-Kurdistan Front in the early 1990s. Yonadam Kanna in particular was a target of the [[Saddam Hussein]] Ba'ath government for many years.

The [[Anfal genocide|Anfal campaign]] of 1986–1989 in Iraq, which was intended to target Kurdish opposition, resulted in 2,000 Assyrians being murdered through its gas campaigns. Over 31 towns and villages, 25 Assyrian monasteries and churches were razed to the ground.

In recent years, the Assyrians in northern Iraq and northeast Syria have become the target of extreme unprovoked [[Islamic terrorism]]. As a result, Assyrians have taken up arms alongside other groups (such as the Kurds, Turcomans and Armenians) in response to unprovoked attacks by [[Al Qaeda]], the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] (ISIL), [[Nusra Front]] and other [[terrorist]] [[Islamic Fundamentalist]] groups. In 2014 Islamic terrorists of ISIL attacked Assyrian towns and villages in the [[Assyrian Homeland]] of northern Iraq, together with cities such as [[Mosul]] and [[Kirkuk]] which have large Assyrian populations. There have been reports of atrocities committed by ISIL terrorists since, including; beheadings, crucifixions, child murders, rape, forced conversions, [[Ethnic Cleansing]], robbery, and extortion in the form of illegal taxes levied upon non Muslims. Assyrians in Iraq have responded by forming armed militias to defend their territories.

The ''[[Dawronoye]]'' modernization movement has a growing influence on Assyrian identity in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=Dawronoye&gt;{{cite web|author=Carl Drott|url=http://www.warscapes.com/reportage/revolutionaries-bethnahrin|title=The Revolutionaries of Bethnahrin|publisher=Warscapes|date=25 May 2015|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly influential in Syria, where the [[Syriac Union Party (Syria)|Syriac Union Party]] (SUP) has become a major political actor in the [[Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]].

Hakkari's Assyrian population was [[ethnically cleanse]]d during the [[Assyrian genocide|Assyrian Genocide]] of the [[First World War]].

===Assyrian subgroups===
There are three main Assyrian subgroups: Eastern, Western, Chaldean. These subdivisions are only partially overlapping linguistically, historicalally, culturalally, and religiously.
* The Eastern subgroup historically inhabited [[Hakkari]] in the northern [[Zagros Mountains]], the [[Simele]] and [[Sapna valley]]s in [[Dohuk|Nuhadra]], and parts of the Nineveh and [[Urmia Plain]]s. They speak [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]] dialects and are religiously diverse, adhering to the [[East Syrian Rite|East Syriac]] churches, [[Protestantism]], [[Judaism]], or are [[irreligion|irreligious]].
* The Chaldean subgroup is a subgroup of the Eastern one. The group is often equated with the adherents of the Chaldean Catholic Church, however not all [[Chaldean Catholics]] identify as Chaldean. They are traditionally speakers of [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]] dialects, however there are some Turoyo speakers. In Iraq, Chaldean Catholics inhabit the western [[Nineveh Plains]] villages of [[Alqosh]], [[Batnaya]], [[Tel Keppe]] and [[Tesqopa]], as well as the [[Nahla valley]] and [[Aqra]]. In Syria they live in [[Aleppo]] and the [[Al-Hasakah Governorate]]. [[Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Amida|In Turkey]], they live scattered in [[Istanbul]], [[Diyarbakir]], [[Sirnak Province]] and [[Mardin Province]].
* The Western subgroup, historically inhabited [[Tur Abdin]] and now have a significant presence in the [[Al-Hasakah Governorate]] in Syria. They mainly speak the [[Central Neo-Aramaic]] language [[Turoyo]]. Most adhere to the [[West Syrian Rite|West Syriac]] churches, but a number are also irreligious.

=== Persecution ===
Due to their Christian faith and ethnicity, the Assyrians have been persecuted since their adoption of Christianity. During the reign of [[Yazdegerd I]], Christians in Persia were viewed with suspicion as potential Roman subversives, resulting in persecutions while at the same time promoting [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Christianity as a buffer between the Churches of Rome and Persia. Persecutions and attempts to impose [[Zoroastrianism]] continued during the reign of [[Yazdegerd II]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1u2oP2RihIgC&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;ots=kajqpsTjCe&amp;dq=constantine%20christianity%20yazdegerd&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q=constantine%20christianity%20yazdegerd&amp;f=false ''This History of the Medieval World''] by Susan Wise Bauer, pg. 85-87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2nWP0_6gkiYC&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;ots=lI-wd4D4Mk&amp;dq=constantine%20christianity%20yazdegerd&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q=constantine%20christianity%20yazdegerd&amp;f=false ''A Short World History of Christianity''] by Robert Bruce Mullin, pp. 82-85&lt;/ref&gt;

During the eras of Mongol rule under [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Timur]], there was indiscriminate slaughter of tens of thousands of Assyrians and destruction of the Assyrian population of northwestern Iran and central and northern Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409819/Nestorian |title=Nestorian (Christian sect) |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent persecutions since the 19th century include the [[Massacres of Badr Khan]], the [[Massacres of Diyarbakır (1895)]], the [[Adana massacre]], the [[Assyrian genocide]], the [[Simele Massacre]], and the [[al-Anfal campaign]].

Since the [[Assyrian genocide]], many Assyrians have left the Middle East entirely for a more safe and comfortable life in the countries of the [[Western world]]. As a result of this, the Assyrian population in the Middle East has decreased dramatically. As of today there are more Assyrians in the diaspora than in their homeland. The largest Assyrian diaspora communities are found in [[Assyrians/Syriacs in Sweden|Sweden]] (100,000),&lt;ref name="Demographics of Sweden"&gt;[http://www.eurfedling.org/Sweden.htm Demographics of Sweden], [[Swedish Language Council]] "Sweden has also one of the largest exile communities of Assyrian and Syriac Christians (also known as Chaldeans) with a population of around 100,000."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assyrians/Syriacs in Germany|Germany]] (100,000),&lt;ref name="Erzdiözese"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sokad.de/index.php/erzdioezese |title=Erzdiözese |publisher= |accessdate=18 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305015143/http://sokad.de/index.php/erzdioezese |archivedate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Assyrian Americans|United States]] (80,000),&lt;ref name="Data Access and Dissemination Systems DADS 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_1YR_S0201&amp;prodType=table|title=American FactFinder – Results|authors=Data Access and Dissemination Systems (DADS)|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Australia]] (46,000).&lt;ref&gt;Assyrian Australian Association &amp; Ettinger House 1997, Settlement Issues of the Assyrian Community, AAA, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, small Assyrian communities are found in [[San Diego]], [[Sacramento]] and [[Fresno]] in the United States, [[Toronto]] in [[Assyrians in Canada|Canada]] and also in [[London]], [[Assyrians in the United Kingdom|UK]] ([[London Borough of Ealing]]). In [[Assyrians/Syriacs in Germany|Germany]], pocket-sized Assyrian communities are scattered throughout [[Munich]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Berlin]] and [[Wiesbaden]]. In [[Paris]], [[Assyrians in France|France]], the commune of [[Sarcelles]] has a small number of Assyrians. [[Assyrians in the Netherlands]] mainly live in the east of the country, in the province of [[Overijssel]]. In [[Assyrians in Russia|Russia]], small groups of Assyrians mostly reside in [[Krasnodar Kray]] and [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="http://www.aina.org/brief.html"/&gt;

To note, the Assyrians residing in [[California]] and Russia tend to be from [[Iranian Assyrians|Iran]], whilst those in Chicago and Sydney are predominantly [[Iraqi Assyrians]]. More recently, [[Syrian Assyrians]] are growing in size in Sydney after a huge influx of new arrivals in 2016, who were granted [[Asylum in Australia|asylum]] under the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]]'s special [[humanitarian]] intake.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssi.org.au/news/ssi-news-blog/938-the-facts-about-syrian-refugees-and-fairfield The facts about Syrian refugees and Fairfield] by SSI News Blog, 23 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-02/fairfield-struggles-to-cope-after-increase-in-refugee-arrivals/8145250 Fairfield struggles to cope after threefold increase in refugee arrivals] by Penny Timms from [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], 3 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrians in Detroit are primarily [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]] speakers, who also originate from Iraq.

Assyrians of the Middle East and diaspora employ different terms for self-identification based on conflicting beliefs in the origin and identity of their respective communities.&lt;ref name="VanDenBerg"&gt;Classical Syriac and the Syriac Churches: A Twentieth-Century History, Heleen Murre-van den Berg, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; In certain areas of the [[Assyrian homeland]], identity within a community depends on a person's village of origin (see [[List of Assyrian villages]]) or Christian denomination rather than their ethnic commonality, for instance [[Chaldean Catholic]]s preferring to be called Chaldeans instead of Assyrians, or a [[Syriac Orthodox Christians (Middle East)|Syriac Orthodox Christian]] preferring to be called a Syriac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/notes/note-n.htm|title=Note on the Modern Assyrians, &amp; Other Nationalistic Issues|work=friesian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century English archaeologist [[Austen Henry Layard]] believed that the [[Syriac Christian]] communities were descended from the ancient Assyrians, a view that was also shared by [[William Ainger Wigram]].&lt;ref name="Cross 2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |last= Cross |first= Frank Leslie |year= 2005 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=9780192802903 |quote= In the 19th cent.

A. Wigram, a member of the Abp. Of Canterbury’s Mission to the Church of the East (1895-1915).|page=119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Assyrians and other minority ethnic groups in the Middle East, feel pressure to identify as "Arabs",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/article/558|title=Iraqi Assyrians: Barometer of Pluralism|author=Jonathan Eric Lewis|work=Middle East Forum|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Already stated above (¶5): Assyrians formed about 5% of Iraq's population before the start of the Iraq War, but since then many have emigrated, mostly to Syria.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/releases/20070416140021.htm |title=Arab American Institute Still Deliberately Claiming Assyrians Are Arabs |publisher=Aina.org |accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Turks" and "Kurds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20061120133220.htm |title=In Court, Saddam Criticizes Kurdish Treatment of Assyrians |publisher=Aina.org |accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[Western Media]] often makes no mention of any ethnic identity of the Christian people of the region and simply call them Christians,&lt;ref name="Al-Monitor"/&gt; [[Iraqi Christians]], [[Iranian Christians]], [[Christianity in Syria|Syrian Christians]], and [[Turkish Christians]], a label rejected by Assyrians.

{{Main|Names of Syriac Christians}}

=== Assyrian vs. Syrian naming controversy ===
As early as the 8th century BC [[Luwian]] and [[Cilician]] subject rulers referred to their Assyrian overlords as ''Syrian'', a western [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] corruption of the original term ''Assyrian''.
This version of the name took hold in the Hellenic lands to the west of the old Assyrian Empire, thus during [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Seleucid]] rule from 323 BC the name ''Assyria'' was altered to ''Syria'', and this term was also applied to [[Aramea]] to the west which had been an Assyrian colony. When the Seleucids lost control of Assyria to the Parthians they retained the corrupted term (Syria), applying it to ancient Aramea, while the Parthians called Assyria "Assuristan," a Parthian form of the original name. It is from this period that the Syrian vs Assyrian controversy arises. Today it is accepted by the majority of scholars that the Medieval, Renaissance and Victorian term ''Syriac'' when used to describe the indigenous Christians of Mesopotamia and its immediate surrounds in effect means ''Assyrian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/ata/20070218144107.htm |title=Inscription From 800 BC Shows the Origin of the Name 'Syria' |publisher=Aina.org |date=2007-02-18 |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern terminological problem goes back to colonial times, but it became more acute in 1946, when with the independence of Syria, the adjective ''Syrian'' referred to an independent state. The controversy isn't restricted to [[exonyms]] like English "Assyrian" vs. "Aramaean", but also applies to self-designation in Neo-Aramaic, the minority "Aramaean" faction endorses both ''Sūryāyē'' {{lang|syr|ܣܘܪܝܝܐ}} and ''Ārāmayē'' {{lang|syr|ܐܪܡܝܐ}}, while the majority "Assyrian" faction insists on ''Āṯūrāyē'' {{lang|syr|ܐܬܘܪܝܐ}} but also accepts ''Sūryāyē''.

[[File:Iraqvillagealqosh.JPG|thumb|left|[[Alqosh]], located in the midst of Assyrian contemporary civilization.]]
The question of ethnic identity and self-designation is sometimes connected to the scholarly debate on the [[Syria (etymology)|etymology of "Syria"]]. The question has a long history of academic controversy, but majority mainstream opinion currently strongly favours that ''Syria'' is indeed ultimately derived from the Assyrian term '''''Aššūrāyu'''''.&lt;ref name="Richard Nelson Frye Syria and Assyria"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frye, R.

Silvio Zaorani (Turin, 1993), pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudolf Macuch points out that the Eastern Neo-Aramaic press initially used the term "Syrian" (''suryêta'') and only much later, with the rise of nationalism, switched to "Assyrian" (''atorêta'').&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Macuch, ''Geschichte der spät- und neusyrischen Literatur'', New York: de Gruyter, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tsereteli, however, a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] equivalent of "Assyrians" appears in ancient Georgian, Armenian and Russian documents.&lt;ref&gt;Tsereteli, ''Sovremennyj assirijskij jazyk'', Moscow: Nauka, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; This correlates with the theory of the nations to the East of Mesopotamia knew the group as Assyrians, while to the West, beginning with Greek influence, the group was known as Syrians. Syria being a Greek corruption of Assyria.

The debate appears to have been settled by the discovery of the [[Çineköy inscription]] in favour of Syria being derived from Assyria.

The ''Çineköy inscription'' is a [[Hieroglyphic Luwian]]-[[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] [[bilingual inscription|bilingual]], uncovered from Çineköy, [[Adana Province]], Turkey (ancient [[Cilicia]]), dating to the 8th century BC. Originally published by Tekoglu and Lemaire (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tekoglu R., Lemaire A. | year = 2000 | title = La bilingue royale louvito-phénicienne de Çineköy | url = | journal = Comptes Rendus des Séances de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres | volume = 2000 | issue = | pages = 960–1006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was more recently the subject of a 2006 paper published in the [[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]], in which the author, Robert Rollinger, lends support to the age-old debate of the name "Syria" being derived from "Assyria" (see [[Etymology of Syria]]).

The object on which the inscription is found is a monument belonging to Urikki, [[vassal]] king of [[Quwê|Hiyawa]] (i.e., [[Cilicia]]), dating to the eighth century BC. In this monumental inscription, Urikki made reference to the relationship between his kingdom and his Assyrian overlords. The Luwian inscription reads "Sura/i" whereas the Phoenician translation reads ''’ŠR'' or "Ashur" which, according to Rollinger (2006), "settles the problem once and for all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Rollinger |title=The terms "Assyria" and "Syria" again |url=http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf | doi=10.1086/511103 |format=PDF |journal=[[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]]| volume=65| issue=4 |pages=284–287 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People often greet and bid relatives farewell with a kiss on each cheek and by saying "{{lang|syr|ܫܠܡܐ ܥܠܝܟ}}" ''[[Shlama]]/Shlomo lokh'', which means: "Peace be upon you" in Neo-Aramaic. Others are greeted with a handshake with the right hand only; according to Middle Eastern customs, the left hand is associated with evil. Similarly, shoes may not be left facing up, one may not have their feet facing anyone directly, whistling at night is thought to waken evil spirits, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, AF.

=== Language ===
{{Main|Neo-Aramaic languages}}
The Neo-Aramaic languages, which are in the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic language family]], ultimately descend from [[Old Aramaic language|Late Old Eastern Aramaic]], the lingua franca in the later phase of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which displaced the [[East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Assyrian dialect of Akkadian]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. Aramaic was the language of commerce, trade and communication and became the vernacular language of Assyria in classical antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightofword.org/aramaic/pdf/Introduction.pdf |title=Introduction: A Brief History of the Aramaic Language|format=PDF |accessdate=2008-11-16| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202005322/http://www.lightofword.org/aramaic/pdf/Introduction.pdf| archivedate=2 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bae C | year = | title = Aramaic as a Lingua Franca During the Persian Empire (538–333 BCE) | url = | journal = Journal of Universal Language | volume = 2004 | issue = | pages = 1–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imperial aramaic"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2718444 Aramaic Documents of the Fifth Century B.

To the native speaker, "Syriac" is usually called ''Surayt'', ''Soureth'', ''Suret'' or a similar regional variant. A wide variety of languages and dialects exist, including [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]], and [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]]. Minority dialects include [[Senaya]] and [[Bohtan Neo-Aramaic]], which are both [[Endangered language|near extinction]]. All are classified as Neo-Aramaic languages and are written using [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac script]], a derivative of the ancient [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic script]]. [[Jewish Aramaic|Jewish]] varieties such as [[Lishanid Noshan]], [[Lishán Didán]] and [[Lishana Deni]], written in the [[Hebrew script]], are spoken by Assyrian Jews.&lt;ref name="Avenery, Iddo 1988"&gt;Avenery, Iddo, ''The Aramaic Dialect of the Jews of Zakho''.

There is a considerable amount of [[mutually intelligible|mutual intelligibility]] between Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, Senaya, Lishana Deni and Bohtan Neo-Aramaic. Therefore, these "languages" would generally be considered to be dialects of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic rather than separate languages. The [[Jewish Aramaic]] languages of Lishan Didan and Lishanid Noshan share a partial intelligibility with these varieties. The mutual intelligibility between the aforementioned languages and Turoyo is, depending on the dialect, limited to partial, and may be asymmetrical.&lt;ref name="Avenery, Iddo 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfhart Heinrichs|Heinrichs, Wolfhart]] (ed.)

Being [[Stateless nation|stateless]], Assyrians are typically multilingual, speaking both their native language and learning those of the societies they reside in.

Many [[List of loanwords in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|loanwords]] from the aforementioned languages also exist in the Neo-Aramaic languages, with the [[Iranian languages]] and Turkish being the greatest influences overall.

====Script====
{{Main|Syriac alphabet}}
Assyrians predominantly use the Syriac script, which is written from right to left. It is one of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[abjad]]s directly descending from the [[Aramaic alphabet]] and shares similarities with the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] and the [[Arabic alphabet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pennacchietti, Fabrizio A. (1997). "On the etymology of the Neo-Aramaic particle qam/kim; in Hebrew", M. Bar-Aher (ed.): Gideon Goldenberg Festschrift, Massorot, Stud&lt;/ref&gt; It has 22 letters representing consonants, three of which can be [[Mater lectionis|also]] used to indicate vowels. The vowel sounds are supplied either by the reader's memory or by optional [[diacritic]] marks. Syriac is a [[cursive]] script where some, but not all, letters connect within a word. It was used to write the [[Syriac language]] from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/578972/Syriac-alphabet | title=Syriac alphabet | work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest and classical form of the alphabet is the ''{{transl|sem|ʾEsṭrangēlā}}'' script.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Hatch|Hatch, William]] (1946). ''An album of dated Syriac manuscripts''. Boston: The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, reprinted in 2002 by Gorgias Press. p. 24. {{ISBN|1-931956-53-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ʾEsṭrangēlā is no longer used as the main script for writing Syriac, it has received some revival since the [[10th century]], and it has been added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in September, 1999. The East Syriac dialect is usually written in the ''{{transl|sem|Maḏnḥāyā}}'' form of the alphabet, which is often translated as "contemporary", reflecting its use in writing modern Neo-Aramaic. The West Syriac dialect is usually written in the ''{{transl|sem|Serṭā}}'' form of the alphabet. Most of the letters are clearly derived from ʾEsṭrangēlā, but are simplified, flowing lines.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eberhard Nestle|Nestle, Eberhard]] (1888). ''Syrische Grammatik mit Litteratur, Chrestomathie und Glossar''. Berlin: H. Reuther's Verlagsbuchhandlung. [translated to English as ''Syriac grammar with bibliography, chrestomathy and glossary'', by R. S. Kennedy. London: Williams &amp; Norgate 1889. p. 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, for practical reasons, Assyrian people would also use the [[Latin alphabet]], especially in [[social media]].

=== Religion ===
[[File:Syriac Christian denominations.svg|thumb|right|Historical divisions within Syriac Christian Churches in the Middle East.]]
{{Main|Syriac Christianity}}
Assyrians belong to various [[Christian denominations]] such as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], with an estimated 400,000 members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_41.html#303 |title=Adherents.com |publisher=Adherents.com |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], with about 600,000 members,&lt;ref&gt;J. Martin Bailey, Betty Jane Bailey, Who Are the Christians in the Middle East? p. 163: "more than two thirds" out of "nearly a million" Christians in Iraq.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] ''(ʿIdto Suryoyto Triṣaṯ Šuḇḥo)'', which has between 1,000,000 and 4,000,000 members around the world (only some of whom are Assyrians),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_622.html|title=Adherents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ancient Church of the East]] with some 100,000 members. A small minority of Assyrians accepted the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 20th century, possibly due to British influences, and is now organized in the [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]], the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and other Protestant Assyrian groups. While Assyrians are predominantly Christian, an echoing minority, particularly those raised in the [[western world|west]], tend to be [[irreligious]] or [[atheist]]ic in nature.

Many members of the following churches consider themselves Assyrian. Ethnic identities are often deeply intertwined with religion, a legacy of the Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet system]].
The group is traditionally characterized as adhering to various churches of Syriac Christianity and speaking Neo-Aramaic languages. It is subdivided into:
* adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]] following the [[East Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Nestorians''
* adherents of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] following the [[West Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Jacobites''
* adherents of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]] following the West Syrian Rite
For obvious reasons the [[Chaldean Catholic]]s who follow the East Syrian Rite and were originally members of the historical [[Church of the East]] are not Nestorian in theology, a designation which the Church of the East itself denied.

Baptism and First Communion are celebrated extensively, similar to a [[Brit Milah]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] in Jewish communities. After a death, a gathering is held three days after burial to celebrate the ascension to heaven of the dead person, as of [[Jesus]]; after seven days another gathering commemorates their death. A close family member wears only black clothes for forty days and nights, or sometimes a year, as a sign of mourning.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Assyrian/Syriac folk music|Syriac sacral music}}
[[File:Assyriankhigga.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[Traditional clothing]] may be worn for [[Assyrian folk dance]].]]
Assyrian music is a combination of traditional [[folk music]] and western contemporary music genres, namely [[pop music|pop]], but also [[rap music|rap]] and recently, [[Electronic dance music|EDM]]. Instruments traditionally used by Assyrians include the [[zurna]] and [[davul]]a, but has expanded to include guitars, pianos, violins, synthesizers (keyboards and [[electronic drum]]s), and other instruments.

Some well known Assyrian singers in modern times are [[Ashur Bet Sargis]], [[Sargon Gabriel]], [[Evin Agassi]], [[Janan Sawa]], [[Juliana Jendo]], and [[Linda George (Assyrian singer)|Linda George]]. Assyrian artists that traditionally sing in other languages include [[Melechesh]], [[Timz]] and [[Aril Brikha]]. Assyrian-Australian band [[Azadoota]] performs its songs in the Assyrian language whilst using a western style of instrumentation.

The first international [[Aramaic Music Festival]] was held in Lebanon in August 2008 for Assyrian people internationally.

=== Dance ===
{{Main|Assyrian folk dance}}
Assyrians have numerous traditional [[dance]]s which are performed mostly for special occasions such as weddings. Assyrian dance is a blend of both ancient indigenous and general near eastern elements. Assyrian folk dances are mainly made up of [[circle dance]]s that are performed in a line, which may be straight, curved, or both – The most common form of Assyrian folk dance is [[khigga]], which is routinely danced as the bride and groom are welcomed into the wedding reception. Most of the circle dances allow unlimited number of participants, with the exception of the ''Sabre Dance'', which require three at most. Assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong, depending on the mood and [[tempo]] of a song.

=== Festivals ===

Assyrian festivals tend to be closely associated with their Christian faith, of which [[Easter]] is the most prominent of the celebrations. Members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church follow the [[Gregorian calendar]] and as a result celebrate Easter on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/easter.php The Date of Easter]. Article from [[United States Naval Observatory]] (March 27, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, members of the Syriac Orthodox Church and Ancient Church of the East celebrate Easter on a Sunday between April 4 and May 8 inclusively on the Gregorian calendar (March 22 and April 25 on the [[Julian calendar]]). During [[Lent]], Assyrians are encouraged to fast for 50 days from meat and any other foods which are animal based.

Assyrians celebrate a number of festivals unique to their culture and traditions as well as religious ones:
* [[Kha b-Nisan]] ''{{Script/Mdnh|ܚܕ ܒܢܝܣܢ}}'', the Assyrian New Year, traditionally on April 1, though usually celebrated on January 1. Assyrians usually wear traditional costumes and hold social events including parades and parties, dancing, and listening to poets telling the story of creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aua.net/News/releases/2006/NewYear2006.pdf AUA Release March 26, 2006.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119121049/http://aua.net/News/releases/2006/NewYear2006.pdf |date=November 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sauma d-Ba'utha]] ''{{Script/Mdnh|ܒܥܘܬܐ ܕܢܝܢܘܝܐ}}'', the Nineveh fast, is a three-day period of fasting and prayer.&lt;ref name=SycOrth&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Day Fast of Nineveh |url=http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/news/2011/02/10/three-day-fast-of-nineveh/ |publisher=syrianorthodoxchurch.org |accessdate=1 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025123007/http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/news/2011/02/10/three-day-fast-of-nineveh/ |archivedate=25 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Somikka, All Saints Day, is celebrated to motivate children to fast during Lent through use of frightening costumes
* Kalu d'Sulaqa, feast of the Bride of the Ascension, celebrates Assyrian resistance to the invasion of Assyria by Tamerlane

Assyrians also practice unique marriage ceremonies. The rituals performed during weddings are derived from many different elements from the past 3,000 years. An Assyrian wedding traditionally lasted a week. Today, weddings in the Assyrian homeland usually last 2–3 days; in the [[Assyrian diaspora]] they last 1–2 days.

=== Traditional clothing ===
{{Main|Assyrian clothing}}
Assyrian clothing varies from village to village. Clothing is usually blue, red, green, yellow, and purple; these colors are also used as embroidery on a white piece of clothing. Decoration is lavish in Assyrian costumes, and sometimes involves jewellery. The conical hats of traditional Assyrian dress have changed little over millennia from those worn in ancient Mesopotamia, and until the 19th and early 20th centuries the ancient Mesopotamian tradition of braiding or platting of hair, beards and moustaches was still commonplace.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Assyrian cuisine}}
Assyrian cuisine is similar to other Middle Eastern cuisines. It is rich in [[grain]], [[meat]], [[potato]], [[cheese]], [[bread]] and [[tomato]]. Typically, [[rice]] is served with every meal, with a stew poured over it. [[Tea]] is a popular drink, and there are several dishes of desserts, snacks, and beverages. [[Alcohol (drug)|Alcohol]]ic drinks such as [[wine]] and [[wheat beer]] are organically produced and drank.

== Genetics ==
{{Further|Genetic history of the Near East}}
Late 20th century DNA analysis conducted by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]], Paolo Menozzi and Alberto Piazza, "shows that Assyrians have a distinct genetic profile that distinguishes their population from any other population."&lt;ref name="assyrianfoundation.org"&gt;[http://www.assyrianfoundation.org/genetics.htm Dr. Joel J. Elias, Emeritus, University of California, The Genetics of Modern Assyrians and their Relationship to Other People of the Middle East]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816235456/http://www.assyrianfoundation.org/genetics.htm |date=August 16, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic analysis of the Assyrians of [[Persia]] demonstrated that they were "closed" with little "intermixture" with the Muslim [[Iranian people|Persian population]] and that an individual Assyrian's genetic makeup is relatively close to that of the Assyrian population as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Akbari M.T. |author2=Papiha Sunder S. |author3=Roberts D.F. |author4=Farhud Daryoush D. | year = 1986 | title = Genetic Differentiation among Iranian Christian Communities | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 84–98 |pmid=3456196 |pmc=1684716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1= Luigi Luca |last1=Cavalli-Sforza|authorlink=Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza |first2=Paolo |last2=Menozzi|first3= Alberto |last3=Piazza|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FrwNcwKaUKoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ISBN0691087504#PPA243,M1 |title=The History and Geography of Human Genes|page= 243|isbn=978-0691087504|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The genetic data are compatible with historical data that religion played a major role in maintaining the Assyrian population's separate identity during the [[Christian era]]".&lt;ref name="assyrianfoundation.org" /&gt;

In a 2006 study of the Y chromosome DNA of six regional [[Armenian people|Armenian]] populations, including, for comparison, Assyrians and [[Syrian people|Syrians]], researchers found that, "the Semitic populations (Assyrians and Syrians) are very distinct from each other according to both [comparative] axes. This difference supported also by other methods of comparison points out the weak genetic affinity between the two populations with different historical destinies." &lt;ref name="Iran and the Caucasus"&gt;[http://www.rau.am/downloads/publ.kafedr/episkoposyan_medbiolog/Yepiskoposian_I&amp;C_06.pdf Yepiskoposian et al., Iran and the Caucasus, Volume 10, Number 2, 2006, pp. 191-208(18), "Genetic Testing of Language Replacement Hypothesis in Southwest Asia"]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study on the genetics of "old ethnic groups in Mesopotamia," including 340 subjects from seven ethnic communities ("Assyrian, Jewish, [[Zoroastrian]], Armenian, [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], the [[Arab people]]s in Iran, Iraq, and [[Kuwait]]") found that Assyrians were homogeneous with respect to all other ethnic groups sampled in the study, regardless of religious affiliation.&lt;ref name="pubmed.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid =  18505046 | doi=10.3378/1534-6617(2008)80[73:VODVAA]2.0.CO;2 | volume=80 | issue=1 | title=Variation of DAT1 VNTR alleles and genotypes among old ethnic groups in Mesopotamia to the Oxus region | date=Feb 2008 | journal=Hum Biol | pages=73–81 | quote = "The relationship probability was lowest between Assyrians and other communities.

In a 2011 study focusing on the genetics of [[Marsh Arabs]] of Iraq, researchers identified Y chromosome haplotypes shared by Marsh Arabs, Iraqis, and Assyrians, "supporting a common local background." &lt;ref name="BMC Evolutionary Biology"&gt;[http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2148-11-288.pdf Al-Zahery et al., BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:288, "In search of the genetic footprints of Sumerians: a survey of Y-chromosome and mtDNA variation in the Marsh Arabs of Iraq"]"In the less frequent J1-M267* clade, only marginally affected by events of expansion, Marsh Arabs shared haplotypes with other Iraqi and Assyrian samples, supporting a common local background."&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 study focusing on the genetics of Northern Iraqi populations, it was found that Iraqi Assyrians and Iraqi [[Yazidis]] clustered together, but away from the other Northern Iraqi populations analyzed in the study, and largely in between the West Asian and Southeastern European populations. According to the study, "contemporary Assyrians and Yazidis from [[Northern Iraq]] may in fact have a stronger continuity with the original genetic stock of the Mesopotamian people, which possibly provided the basis for the ethnogenesis of various subsequent Near Eastern populations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dogan|first1=Serkan|title=A glimpse at the intricate mosaic of ethnicities from Mesopotamia: Paternal lineages of the Northern Iraqi Arabs, Kurds, Syriacs, Turkmens and Yazidis|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=12|issue=11|pages=e0187408|date=3 November 2017|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0187408|pmid=29099847|pmc=5669434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haplogroups===
The most common [[Y-DNA haplogroup]]s among Assyrians is [[Haplogroup T-M184|T-M184]], at 41.5%, which is frequent in [[Middle Eastern Jews]], [[Georgian people|Georgians]], [[Druze people|Druze]] and [[Somali people|Somalians]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In a [[DNA test]] comprising 48 Assyrian male subjects from Iran, the Y-DNA haplogroups [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J-M304]], found in its greatest concentration in the [[Arabian peninsula]], and the [[Indo-European migrations|Indo European]]-linked [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]] (specifically [[R-M269]]), were also frequent at 29.2% each.&lt;ref name = "Grugni" &gt;Grugni, Viola et al 2012, [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0041252?imageURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0041252.t001 Ancient Migratory Events in the Middle East: New Clues from the Y-Chromosome Variation of Modern Iranians] PLoS ONE 7(7): e41252. Doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0041252&lt;/ref&gt; In other tests taken, R1b has reached 40%, making it a major haplogroup among Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;Klyosov, A. A. (2010a). Haplogroup R1b1 and its subclades in Asia. Proceedings of the Russian Academy of DNA Genealogy, 3, 1676 - 1695 (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; The R1b was brought from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]] in [[Eurasia]], a region hypothesised to be the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland]], where the R1b bearers went south over the [[Caucasus mountains]] via [[Anatolia]] and into Mesopotamia at around 6,000 B.P.&lt;ref&gt;Klyosov, A.

{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Bapu's paintings focus on [[Hindu mythology|Hindu mythological]] characters, and he has painted the Hindu epic [[Ramayana]] as a pictorial [[Narrative|story]].  His character portrayals, such as [[Shiva]], [[Bhima]], [[Duryodhana]], look distinctly male with wide chests, large jaws and large biceps; while [[Krishna]] and [[Rama]] are more feminine in build.

His paintings have decorated the cover pages of many magazines in India and Abroad. Telugu Naadi Magazine published from USA for Telugu audience have published Bapu's great paintings. Bapu also later served on their advisory board to guide and have an outstanding content for the magazine that catered to Telugu people.

==Association with Ramana==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Bapu and Ramana gari Statue.jpg|thumb|Bapu &amp; Ramana gari statue on the banks of River Godavari around Pushkaram. Their friendship is so thick that one can't even imagine individual statues for each. 
I't not an exaggeration to say that the full name of 'Bapu' is 'Mullapudi Venkataramana'.]]
Bapu's family was staying in Madras and in 1942, when the Japanese bombed Madras, there was a panic exodus and Bapu's family moved to Narasapuram and stayed there till 1945, when the Second World War ended. Bapu studied in Taylor High School, Narasapuram during these years.

Mullapudi Venkataramana's father, who was working as a Sub-Registrar was posted at Narasapuram during the years 1942-45 and so, Venkataramana also studied in Taylor high School, Narasapram, during those years. They were classmates during those three years and that is how their association started. They continued schooling at Kesari High School, Madras. Ramana's first short story 'Amma Maata Vinakapote' was published in 1945 in 'Bala', a children's magazine published by Radio Annayya (Nyayapathi Raghava Rao), he was 14 then. Bapu illustrated the story. That was the beginning of their career as a writer-producer -illustrator- filmmaker duo".

Started as an illustrator-story writer team and then turning into a film-director-writer duo, they have contributed immensely to the enrichment of Telugu cultural ethos through literature and cinema. When one mentions Bapu, then one is bound to mention Ramana's name too and vice versa. The most notable achievement in his movie making is his success in capturing the nativity of Telugu people and translating it great on-screen visuals.

Ventures like ''Sampoorna Ramayanam'', ''Ramanjaneya Yuddham'' and ''Seeta Kalyanam'' have been the milestones of Telugu cinema, while historical films like ''Thyagayya'', ''Bhakta Kannappa'' and  ''Shreenatha kavisarvabhouma'' have been hugely successful. Bapu-Ramana combination has created movie magic on the large screen with some of the path breaking films in Telugu cinema and are ever remembered for films like ''Radha kalyanam'', ''Velugu needalu'', ''Bharyabhartalu'', ''Bhogimanta'', ''Mutyala Muggu'', 'Sakshi'', ''Mr. Pellam', ''Pelli Pustakam''. The duo directed [[Mana Voori Pandavulu]] (1978) which won the [[Filmfare Award for Best Film - Telugu]].

==Collaborations with other artists==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
He worked with [[Satyam Sankaramanchi]] and drew 101 pictures for each of the stories in ''[[Amaravati Kathalu]]''. Bapu is one-half of the Bapu-Ramana ([[Mullapudi Venkata Ramana]]) pair that made movies in Telugu cinema.  Ramana provided an able foil, providing script and dialogue to suit Bapu's visuals. Bapu collaborated with Ramana to give life to Ramana's child prodigy character ''[[Budugu]]'' in the form of appealing caricatures.

==Hindi cinema==

[[File:Deforest adv.jpg|thumb|1910 ''The New York Times'' advertisement for the wireless radio]]

The '''birth of public radio broadcasting''' is credited to [[Lee de Forest]] who transmitted the world’s first public broadcast in [[New York City]] on January 13, 1910. This broadcast featured the voices of [[Enrico Caruso]] and other [[Metropolitan Opera]] stars. Members of the public and the press used earphones to listen to the broadcast in several locations throughout the city. This marked the beginning of what would become nearly universal [[wireless]] [[radio]] communication.    

==First public broadcast==

===Date===

 A 1907 Lee De Forest company advertisement said, {{Quote|It will soon be possible to distribute grand opera music from transmitters placed on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House by a Radio Telephone station on the roof to almost any dwelling in Greater New York and vicinity ... The same applies to large cities. Church music, lectures, etc., can be spread abroad by the Radio Telephone.&lt;ref name="history1" /&gt;}}

Several years later, on January 13, 1910, the first public [[radio broadcast]] was an experimental transmission of a live [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]] performance by several famous opera singers.&lt;ref name="chase" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/deforest.htm |title=Lee De Forest history |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610152532/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/deforest.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whoswho"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nrcdxas.org/articles/who1st.txt|title= Radio's version of "Who's On First?"|accessdate= June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="live1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smart90.com/deforest |title=Television International magazine article – ''Lee De Forest'' – (1873–1961) |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117104308/http://www.smart90.com/deforest |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="learfield"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://learfielddata.blogspot.com/2006_01_08_archive.html|title= Today in History, Jan 13|accessdate= June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA_TimesArchives"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/16975686.html?dids=16975686:16975686&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+07%2C+1996&amp;author=SUSAN+KING&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Cable%3B+Radio+Daze%3B+AMC'S+FIRST+LIVE-ACTION+SERIES+TUNES+INTO+THE+GOLDEN+AGE+OF+THE+WIRELESS&amp;pqatl=google|title= L.A.

January 13, 1910. Radio pioneer and electron tube inventor Lee De Forest arranged the world's first radio broadcast to the public at New York, New York. He succeeded in broadcasting the voice of Enrico Caruso along with other stars of the Metropolitan Opera to several receiving locations in the city where listeners with earphones marveled at wireless music from the air. Though only a few were equipped to listen, it was the first broadcast to reach the public and the beginning of a new era in which wireless radio communication became almost universal."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performers===
The [[wireless]] [[radio]] broadcast consisted of performances of ''[[Cavalleria Rusticana]]'' and ''[[Pagliacci]]''. [[Riccardo Martin]] performed as Turridu, [[Emmy Destinn]] as Santuzza, and [[Enrico Caruso]] as Canio.&lt;ref name="LA_TimesArchives" /&gt;&lt;ref name="concertopera"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.concertoperaboston.org/cavalleria.html|title= Cavalleria Rusticana and I Pagliacci|accessdate= June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soundmusic"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDE103FF937A25752C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=|title= Sound; Out of De Forest and onto the air came music|accessdate= June 24, 2008 | work=The New York Times | first=Hans | last=Fantel | date=January 14, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conductor was [[Egisto Tango]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1910-01-13/ed-1/seq-14|title=The New York Tribune, January 13, 1910, p.14, "Amusements" listings|accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event is regarded as the birth of public radio broadcasting.&lt;ref name="chase" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="learfield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="adventures1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="onthisdate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="discoveries"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/btfore.html|title= People and Discoveries|accessdate= June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''New York Times'' reported on January 14, 1910: {{Quote|Opera broadcast in part from the stage of the New York City Metropolitan Opera Company was heard on January 13, 1910, when Enrico Caruso and Emmy Destinn sang arias from ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' and ''I Pagliacci'', which were "trapped and magnified by the dictograph directly from the stage and borne by wireless Hertzian waves over the turbulent waters of the sea to transcontinental and coastwise ships and over the mountainous peaks and undulating valleys of the country." The microphone was connected by telephone wire to the laboratory of Dr. Lee De Forest.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The few radio receivers able to pick up this first-ever "outside broadcast" were those at the De Forest Radio Laboratory, on board ships in New York Harbor, in large hotels on Times Square and at New York city locations where members of the press were stationed at receiving sets.&lt;ref name="history1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="adventures1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="onthisdate"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nDD0DGXTJiYC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Birth+radio+broadcasting+Lee+de+Forest+%22Enrico+Caruso%22+&amp;source=web&amp;ots=IrJ1u-kMTq&amp;sig=gSizzurAMZtIRX3Nyal4RljMg2k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result|title= ''On This Date: A Day-by-Day Listing of Holidays, Birthdays, and Historic,'' by Sandy Whiteley, p. 13 |accessdate= June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public receivers with earphones had been set up in several well-advertised locations throughout New York City. There were members of the press stationed at various receiving sets throughout the city and the public was invited to listen to the broadcast.&lt;ref name="soundmusic" /&gt;

The experiment was considered mostly unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="concertopera" /&gt; The microphones of the day were of poor quality and could not pick up most of the singing on stage.&lt;ref name="concertopera" /&gt; Only off-stage singers singing directly into a microphone could be heard clearly.&lt;ref name="concertopera" /&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported the next day that [[Radio atmospheric|static]] and interference "kept the homeless song waves from finding themselves".&lt;ref name="soundmusic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Wireless Melody Jarred," The New York Times, Friday, January 14, 1910, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Lee De Forest's Radio Telephone Company manufactured and sold the first commercial radios in the demonstration room at the [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower|Metropolitan Life Building]] in New York City for this public event.&lt;ref name="adventures1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/TV_TL_COMP_2.html |title=A D V E N T U R E S   in   C Y B E R S O U N D |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705032825/http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/TV_TL_COMP_2.html |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmitter===
The wireless transmitter had 500 watts of power.&lt;ref name="concertopera" /&gt; It is reported that this broadcast was heard 20&amp;nbsp;km away on a ship at sea.&lt;ref name="bigbeginning"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://165.29.91.7/classes/humanities/amstud/97-98/radio/1901.htm |title=1901–1910: Radio's Big Beginning |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810203804/http://165.29.91.7/classes/humanities/amstud/97-98/radio/1901.htm |archivedate=August 10, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The broadcast was also heard in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="bridgeport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbci.com/~wenonah/history/edpart4.htm |title=Taking the Crucial Step for Modern Technology |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430115351/http://www.hbci.com/~wenonah/history/edpart4.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other broadcasts==

===Early music transmission===

The very first transmission of music by radio is credited to one Dr. Nussbaumer of the [[University of Graz]] in 1904, however it was not to the public. He yodeled an Austrian folk song into an experimental transmitter which was received in the next room at the university where he worked. He does not show in any standard scientific reference works.&lt;ref name="soundmusic" /&gt;

Lee De Forest produced a program broadcasting opera phonograph records from the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris in 1908. This was just an experimental stunt for other nearby hobbyists and not considered a public broadcast as the public had no access to receivers at the time.&lt;ref name="father1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/lyon95065/Radio.html |title= Who said Lee de Forest was the "Father of Radio"?|accessdate= June 24, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091024075706/http://geocities.com/lyon95065/Radio.html |archivedate = October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, when testing the radiotelephone for the Navy, Lee de Forest played patriotic phonograph music as the ships entered the harbor.&lt;ref name="history1" /&gt;

'''Candice Rose Martinez''' (born c. 1986), also known as the '''"Cell Phone Bandit,"''' committed four [[Bank robbery|bank robberies]] in Northern Virginia, U.S., in October and November 2005, when she was a 19-year-old [[Northern Virginia Community College]] student.  She was given the "Cell Phone Bandit" nickname by the media because she spoke on her cell phone while committing the robberies.

Candice received international notoriety when surveillance footage of the robberies was aired on newscasts worldwide, showing her talking on her cell phone during the robberies. It was later discovered that Martinez was talking to her 19-year-old boyfriend Dave C. Williams, who was also driving her getaway car.  The case attracted widespread attention due to Martinez's being a young, attractive female college student, as well as the brazen way she conducted the robberies: while calmly talking on her phone.

Dave C. Williams and Martinez were arrested on November 14 and 15, 2005, respectively. Martinez confessed shortly after her arrest. A total of $48,620 was stolen in the four heists. The couple bought a 1997 [[Acura Integra]], two big-screen televisions, and plenty of designer clothes and bags, court records state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/03/national/main1365719.shtml 'Cell Phone Bandit' Gets 12 Years, Woman, 20, Known For Chatting On Phone During Bank Robberies - CBS News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2005, Martinez pleaded guilty in [[U.S. District Court]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], to two [[felony]] charges. On March 3, 2006, she was sentenced to 12 years in the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], to be followed by 5 years supervised release ([[probation]]), a $200 special assessment ([[court costs]]), and $43,850 in [[restitution]] by U.S. District [[Judge]] Gerald Bruce Lee.

The number of '''Chinese people in Namibia''' has grown tremendously since [[New York Accords|independence]].

==Migration history==
As recently as 1998, [[China Radio International]] reported there to be only fifty Chinese people doing business in Namibia, but by 2005 that had grown to more than a thousand.&lt;ref name="ChinaCity"&gt;{{citation|periodical=China Radio International|date=2005-01-28|accessdate=2011-10-08|title=纳米比亚有座中国城 {{bracket|Namibia has a Chinatown}} |url=http://gb.cri.cn/2201/2005/01/28/381@436948.htm|author=王蕾}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 U.S. embassy estimate released by [[WikiLeaks]] in the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] states there are three or four thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://wikileaks.org/cable/2009/04/09WINDHOEK118.htm|title=Update on Chinese activities in Namibia|publisher=WikiLeaks.org |date=2009-04-09|accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition politicians such as [[Jurie Viljoen]] of [[Monitor Action Group]] have made accusations that uncontrolled issuance of work permits has led to an influx of as many as 40,000 Chinese labourers,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alden|Large|Soares de Oliveira|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k9JT3qRqxzYC&amp;pg=PA24 240]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a figure confirmed by Malia Politzer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?id=690 |title=China and Africa: Stronger Economic Ties Mean More Migration |author=Malia Politzer |publisher=Migration Information Source |date=August 2008 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade==
In the 2000s, trade between [[China]] and [[Namibia]] grew, rising from in $75 million in 2003 to $600 million in 2009.&lt;ref name="trade"&gt;{{citation|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201010041203.html|periodical=[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]]|date=2010-10-04|accessdate=2011-10-08|title=Trade with China Grows|first=Chrispin|last=Inambao}}&lt;/ref&gt; China City, a wholesale and retail centre located in an industrial area of northern Windhoek about 20 minutes from downtown, was opened in 1998 by Li Chengyuan (李澄原), a businessman from [[Taiwan]]; by 2005, merchants there were importing about 1,000 [[shipping container|container]]s of goods per year from China.&lt;ref name="ChinaCity"/&gt;

Many Chinese migrants establish small retail businesses particularly in clothing and jewelry.&lt;ref name="Xoagub"&gt;{{citation|title=Namibia: Chinese 'Invasion' Gets Mixed Reaction|first=Francis|last=Xoagub|date=2011-02-17|periodical=New Era|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201102170599.html|accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of Chinese traders has drawn complaints from local traders about competition and concern about quality and safety. However, some Namibians welcomed the addition of Chinese in the retail sector citing the benefit of employment creation and lower costs of goods.

[[Oshikango]], on [[:Category:Angola–Namibia border|the border]] with [[Angola]] has become a popular destination for Chinese traders hoping to take advantage of expanding cross-border trade. By 2004, the town had 22 Chinese-owned shops, expanding to 75 by 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alden|Large|Soares de Oliveira|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k9JT3qRqxzYC&amp;pg=PA246 246]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From shoes and textiles, these shops have expanded their product offerings to include furniture, home electronics, motorcycles, [[artificial flower]]s, and various other types of goods. Shop owners import their goods through the ports at [[Walvis Bay]] or [[Durban]] in [[South Africa]], and bring them in by [[rail transport in Namibia|rail]] for storage in [[bonded warehouse]]s, where they are then sold on to Angolan traders for export to Angola in small quantities, thus avoiding customs duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alden|Large|Soares de Oliveira|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k9JT3qRqxzYC&amp;pg=PA247 247]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, Chinese businesspeople have set up factories in Oshikango. However these do not produce genuinely competitive goods; their main function is to get work permits for Chinese expatriates who can then work as shop assistants in import/export businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alden|Large|Soares de Oliveira|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k9JT3qRqxzYC&amp;pg=PA249 249]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration and community==
There are a few Chinese restaurants (three in Windhoek) and grocery stores in the country.  The restaurants are popular among local Namibians.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.newera.com.na/article.php?articleid=40599&amp;title=Namibians%20take%20to%20Chinese%20food|title=Namibians take to Chinese food|first=Namene|last=Helmich|date=2011-09-12|accessdate=2011-10-08|periodical=New Era}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The embassy's [[Chinese New Year]] celebration in 2010 reportedly attracted more than 1,000 Chinese guests, including migrants, international students, and representatives of Chinese multinationals stationed in the country, as well as about 100 local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2010-02/10/content_12964164.htm|date=2010-02-10|accessdate=2011-10-08|title=纳米比亚华侨华人举行春节庆祝活动 {{bracket|Overseas Chinese in Namibia hold New Year celebration activities}}|periodical=Xinhua News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chundrigar''' are a [[Islam|Muslim]] community found in the state of [[Gujarat]], [[India]]. A few are also found in the city of [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Gujarat Population: Musalmans and Parsis, Volume IX  page 72  Government Central Press, Bombay&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

The Chundrigars are a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] speaking community, associated with the silk knot printing and manufacture of a piece of cloth known as the ''chunri'' or ''dupata''. They claim to have been [[Arab]]s who settled in [[Sindh]] and then moved to Gujarat. There largest concentration is the city of [[Surat]], although there is a large diaspora in Karachi. According to some traditions, the community are a sub-group within the [[Manihar]] community. This is shown by the fact the community intermarry with the Manihars, and are members of the Gujarat Manihar Jamat. Almost all the Chundrigar community have abandoned their traditional occupation. They are now mainly a community of petty traders, with a few successful businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Gujarat Population: Musalmans and Parsis, Volume IX  pages 72  Government Central Press, Bombay&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Pakistan Movement|independence of Pakistan]] in 1947, many moved to the newly created Muslim state of Pakistan. [[Ibrahim Ismail Chundrigar]] served as Pakistan's finance minister and later as [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21258">'''Communication for social change''', referred to as '''''communication for sustainable social change and development''''', involves the use of variety of communication techniques to address inefficient systems, processes, or modes of production within a specific location that has not incurred major technological advances. Different mediums and approaches are used to help individuals among the targeted society to acquire new knowledge and skills. This will allow communities not only to experience change but to guide it as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=FAO, Government of Italy, UNESCO, World Bank, IDRC, CTA|title=Communication for Development Roundtable Report|year=2005|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location=Rome|pages=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9M8RvHprJYC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=communication+for+sustainable+social+change+and+development&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qgWOTr_lCaTy0gGkq9UM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=communication%20for%20sustainable%20social%20change%20and%20development&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible strategy in achieving [[sustainability]] and development places the people of the community in the center of the communication process.  This technique is also known as the participatory approach where [[interpersonal communication]] is exercised through community media. The members of the culture are agents of change as opposed to the outsiders who may provide any necessary tools. Technology then becomes implemented by people in their social and economic contexts and results in a major shaping process. The participatory approach can be combined with three other types of communicative methods to effectively invoke social change. These include: [[behavior change communication]], [[mass communication]], and advocacy communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=FAO, Government of Italy, UNESCO, World Bank, IDRC, CTA ,|title=Communication for Development Roundtable Report|year=2005|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location=Rome|pages=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9M8RvHprJYC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=communication+for+sustainable+social+change+and+development&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qgWOTr_lCaTy0gGkq9UM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=communication%20for%20sustainable%20social%20change%20and%20development&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of mediums can be used in achieving governance, health and sustainable development. Old media can be combined with new media to educate specific populations. [[Information and communication technologies]] (ICTs) in addition to [[multi-media]] are able to address visual, auditory and kinesthetic learners and prove to be an important contribution to economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schreyer|first=Paul|title=The Contribution of Information and Communication Technology to Output Growth: A Study of the G7 Countries|journal=OECD Science, Technology and Industry Working Papers 2000/2|date=22 March 2000|pages=3|doi=10.1787/151634666253|url=http://www.tos.camcom.it/Portals/_UTC/Studi/ScenariEconomici/39746563563847689/wppdf_file=5lgsjhvj7mwk.pdf|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions need to be raised about who the stake holders, policy makers, partners and practitioners are and what their goals might be for the community seeking sustainable development. Oftentimes, those who set the agenda are the ones doing the funding for the project and may include international agencies, bilateral agencies, national authorities, [[NGO]]s, and local organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyson|first=Jack K|title=Resources for Mobilizing Funding for Development Projects|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTMACEDONIA/Resources/Resources_for_Mobilizing_Funding_for_Development.doc|work=International Youth Foundation and the Small Grants Program of the World Bank|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the project, decision makers consider if introducing new technology will disrupt religion, language, political organization, economy, familial relations and [[social complexity]] of the targeted society. Other factors have to be acknowledged as well and may include already present policies and legislations, educational systems, service provisions, institutional and organizational constructions (in the forms of [[corruption]], [[bureaucracy]], etc.), socio-demographic and economic aspects, and the physical environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factors of Change|url=http://www.sociologyguide.com/social-change/factors-of-change.php|publisher=Sociology Guide|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MDGs==
The '''[[Millennium Development Goals]]''' ('''MDGs''') are an official set of universal goals created by world leaders and adopted by the [[United Nations]] to be completed within a specific time frame (2000–2015). They address various aspects of human development and are categorized into eight objectives:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goals, Targets and Indicators|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/goals/gti.htm|work=Millennium Development Goals|publisher=Millennium Project|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Eradicate Extreme Hunger and Poverty
# Achieve Universal Primary Education
# Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women
# Reduce Child Mortality
# Improve Maternal Health
# Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases
# Ensure Environmental Sustainability
# Develop a Global Partnership for Development

These goals tackle extreme poverty in multiple parts of the world but with already pre-existing setbacks, their feasibility is questioned. Progress in Latin America and the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East and North Africa, combined, was a tenth met of the last agreed target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vandemoortele|first=Jan|title=Are the MDGs feasible?|url=http://62.193.78.3/cah/pdf/mdgs_feasible.pdf|work=United Nations Development Programme|publisher=United Nations Development Programme Bureau for Development Policy|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development in [[Latin America]] has been discussed since the early 1950s and began with the [[diffusion of innovations]] concept where countries like Brazil and Colombia would incorporate models brought by developed countries to foster economic growth, use media for technological and scientific advancements, address local problems and manage processes of [[modernization]]. In the 1970s such type of development was criticized because it responded to the interests of the wealthier, already developed countries. As development efforts continued to fail and socio-economic and financial limitations surfaced, the 1980s were described as [[La Decada Perdida]] (The lost decade in Latin America).&lt;ref name="de Alcazar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Alcazar|first=Migdalia Pineda|title=The digital era and alternatives for human and communications development in Latin America|journal=International Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Politics|year=2010|volume=6|issue=3|pages=283–293|doi=10.1386/mcp.6.3.283_1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 October 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Development in Latin America is not the same as for countries more economically advanced like the United States. The differences are not only economic but social and cultural as well. Any intervention has to take into account the context in which change can be implemented and address not only the elite culture but the popular one as well. Interactive, digital, and participatory technology is encouraged to take part in the development process more so to educate members of the community and to encompass popular innovations and individual creativity. [[Public policies]] in information technologies need to reflect local development in order to guide practices of change for other regions. Concurrently, they need to promote members of the community to stimulate change by finding their own meaning in applications that could potentially improve quality of life. In order to reduce inequality First Human Development Report for Latin America &amp; the Caribbean proposes that policies must affect people (reach), address setbacks that cause poverty (breadth) and empower people to create the change desired (ownership).&lt;ref name="UNDP"&gt;{{cite news|last=UNDP|title=First Human Development Report for Latin America &amp; the Caribbean|url=http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2010/july/pnud-presenta-el-primer-informe-regional-sobre-desarrollo-humano.en|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=United Nations Development Programme|date=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of thinking is a new approach to development and may be one possible solution to combat the eight objectives of human development in Latin America the Millennium Development Goals strive to address.&lt;ref name="de Alcazar" /&gt;

=== Setbacks for development ===
World Bank classifies Latin America in the lower middle and upper middle income range. An estimated 181 million individuals (33.2 percent of the population) live in [[poverty]] and seventy-one million of these (12.9 percent) in indigence.&lt;ref name="Notas de Cepal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Notas de Cepal|title=Learning from Latin America|url=http://cdj.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/3/265.full#fn-3|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2002 and 2008, forty-one million people were able to sustain enough progress to no longer be characterized as poverty but with the current [[Global recession]], this number has decreased by nine million.&lt;ref name="Notas de Cepal" /&gt; Ten of the 15 countries with the highest levels of inequality are in the region. Women, indigenous populations and those of African descent are most affected. Females in the region take a greater part in the informal economy and have double the workload than males but are paid less for their efforts. When compared to those of European descent, twice as many members of indigenous and African descended populations, on average, live on US$1 per day.&lt;ref name="UNDP" /&gt; Latin America still faces corrupt political, judicial, and security institutions protective of the interests of the wealthy. The second edition of the ''Global Burden of Armed Violence'' report by the Secretariat of the [[Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development]], released in October 2011, characterized [[El Salvador]] as being the "most violent country in the world" during 2004–9, with an average annual violent death rate of over 60 per 100,000 people during that period, just ahead of Iraq.&lt;ref name="Geneva Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|last=Geneva Declaration|title=Global Burden of Armed Violence 2011 |url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/measurability/global-burden-of-armed-violence/global-burden-of-armed-violence-2011.html|publisher=Geneva Declaration Secretariat|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first week of November (2011), Manuel Melgar (the justice and public security minister of El Salvador) resigned from his post. The region overall is second to [[South Africa]] in terms of levels of crime and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNODC|title=International Homicide Statistics, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/ihs.html|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational practices are also being questioned across the region. [[Chile]] has been experiencing five months of protests against the government's attempt to maintain the higher education's private sector model. Students and teachers in opposition hope to revert to a state funded model, under an "[[Education for All]]" slogan in fear of emerging from universities with debts and loans. These street demonstrations, now catching congress' attention, are a threat to Chiles' 2012 budget. Without the proposed spending, potential education, health, training and [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty program]]s will cease.&lt;ref name = "LatinNews"&gt;{{cite news|last=LatinNews|title=Even more of a haven? Economy &amp; Business|url=http://www.latinnews.com.silk.library.umass.edu/component/k2/item/48899.html?period=2011&amp;archive=25&amp;cat_id=786369%3Aeven-more-of-a-haven%3F&amp;Itemid=6|accessdate=11 November 2011|newspaper=LatinNews|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Latin America, risks of [[inflation]] and excessive currency appreciation are a concern to the region's long-term growth prospects and present instability in the financial sector. Current events such as the [[European debt crisis]], the slow recovery in the US, natural and nuclear disasters in [[Japan]] and the implications from the political turmoil in the [[Middle East]] stall progress within the region and foreshadow more difficult economic conditions.&lt;ref name="World Bank"&gt;{{cite web|last=World Bank|title=Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Brief|url=http://go.worldbank.org/3TIKEV9IQ0|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Progress ===
Growth in Latin America – not including the [[Caribbean]] region – is expected to average between 3.5 and 4.5 percent of [[GDP]] in 2011 (better than economic activity in some developed nations). Progress is attributed to current macroeconomic management, a constant domestic demand, commodity export boom, and the commodity increase in prices which have spurred investments in mining and energy. Unemployment rates have dropped down to seven percent and current results are better than in most North American areas and some wealthier European nations. In the fiscal year 2011, [[World Bank Group]] has produced $14.7 billion in funding for the region. Contributions have been made by [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD), the [[International Development Association]] (IDA), the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC) and the [[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency]] (MIGA). Most of the funding was devoted to health, social, transportation, and [[public administration]] services. Countries that received the most financial help were Mexico ($2.7 billion), Brazil ($2.5 billion), and Argentina ($2.2 billion).&lt;ref name="World Bank" /&gt; Funding stimulates development which in turn promotes investment as the current case in Latin America. UN's [[Economic Commission for Latin America]] (Eclac) calculated that [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) in 18 Latin American and Caribbean countries totaled to US$82.65bn in the first half of 2011 (up 54% compared to the same period during 2010). These numbers are on the path to be a new historic record in 2011.&lt;ref name = "LatinNews" /&gt;

''Countries with highest FDI increase''
#[[Brazil]] – Received US$44bn in FDI in the first six months of 2011 (an increase of 157% from the same 2010 period).
#[[Colombia]] – FDI jumped 91%, to nearly US$7bn (more than it received in all of 2010).
#[[Venezuela]] – US$1.18bn in the first half of 2011

Progress in Latin America has also been attributed to higher employment rates. In Colombia alone, 700,000 jobs were created since [[Juan Carlos Echeverry (politician)|Juan Carlos Echeverry]] took up presidency in 2010. The government wants to create 2.5 million additional jobs by the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LatinNews|title=COLOMBIA: Bold promises|url=http://www.latinnews.com/component/k2/item/48866.html?period=2011&amp;archive=25&amp;cat_id=786369%3Acolombia-bold-promises&amp;Itemid=6|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=LatinNews|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to employment opportunities, efforts to improve education are in progress. In February 2010, the World Bank and [[Shakira]]'s advocacy group [[ALAS Foundation]] launched a joint venture to improve [[Early Childhood Development]] for low income children in Latin America. During the first year of the program, more than half a million kids were provided with health care, adequate nutrition and early education.&lt;ref name="World Bank" /&gt;
 
Thirty-five percent of [[Belize]]'s population is under the age of fourteen. The country has the highest [[HIV]] prevalence in Central America and the third-highest in the Caribbean after the Bahamas and Haiti, according to a 2007 study. [[UNAIDS]] estimates some 3,600 people are currently living with HIV in Belize, 2,000 of which are women. As of December 2010, [[UNDP]] began implementing an HIV/AIDS grant agreement designed by the [[Global Fund]] to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, &amp; Malaria. The program aims to halt the spread of HIV in Belize by educating young people aged 15–24 about implications, prevention and treatment. Global Fund and UNDP are also providing access to [[condoms]], subsidized referrals, testing, [[anti-retroviral drugs]] free of cost at all treatment points, psychosocial support to people living with HIV, and specialized training to professional service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=UNDP|title=UNDP HIV programme aims to reach youth in Belize|url=http://www.beta.undp.org/undp/en/home/presscenter/articles/2011/08/02/undp-hiv-programme-aims-to-reach-youth-in-belize.html|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=United Nations Development Programme|date=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last 20 years [[Mexico]] experienced a number of reforms to increase representation of [[indigenous peoples]] (13 percent of the country´s total population) in order to ensure their participation in decision-making. The Mexican Government approved 28 indigenous territorial boundaries and electoral districts which have been highlighted in the documentary ''Indigenous Identity and Democracy in Mexico''. UNDP is currently working with the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation Development (AECID) to have government and indigenous groups from [[Bolivia]] and Mexico share experiences in electoral and political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=UNDP|title=Mexico and UNDP highlight indigenous peoples' political participation|url=http://www.beta.undp.org/undp/en/home/presscenter/articles/2011/05/19/mexico-and-undp-highlight-indigenous-peoples-political-participation.html|accessdate=3 December 2011|newspaper=United Nations Development Programme|date=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region has also incurred technological advances to combat climate change. The [[Global Environment Facility]] of UNDP in collaboration with the Brazilian [[Ministry of Mines and Energy (Brazil)|Ministry of Mines and Energy]] (MME), [[Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos de São Paulo]] (EMTU/SP) while financed with resources from the [[Global Environmental Facility]] (GEF) and [[Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos]] (FINEP) were able to create the first hydrogen-powered bus in Latin America. The Brazilian Hydrogen-Cell-Fueled Bus project announced the finished product on July 1 of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Portal Brasil|title=Press releases – Brazil has first hydrogen-fueled bus|url=http://www.brasil.gov.br/para/press/press-releases/february/brazil-has-first-hydrogen-fueled-bus|accessdate=3 December 2011|newspaper=brasil.gov.br|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[São Paulo, Brazil]], with eighteen million inhabitants, now has a hydrogen-powered bus fueled by water that exudes clean vapor instead of fumes and [[carbon dioxide]]. The bus can carry 63 passengers and with hydrogen alone can run up to 300&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=UNDP|title=Latin America's first water-powered bus on the streets of São Paulo|url=http://www.beta.undp.org/undp/en/home/presscenter/articles/2009/07/06/latin-americas-first-water-powered-bus-plying-the-streets-of-sao-paulo.html|accessdate=3 December 2011|newspaper=United Nations Development Programme|date=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Counterplanning''' is the process through which an actor reaches his or her [[goal]]s by formulating plans that account for the plans and goals of others (e.g. enemies, neutrals, or friends).&lt;ref&gt;Carbonell, J. G.  (1979).  The Counterplanning Process.  Proceedings of the 6th International Joint Conference On Artificial Intelligence, 1979, Tokyo Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the plans and goals of one actor interfere with those of another actor, a [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] exists. These conflicts lead to second- and third-order undesired effects. The best counterplanning techniques to be used in a given situation vary based on the characteristics of the conflict. Counterplanning techniques are common in [[everyday life]] and in [[military plan]]ning.

==Goal Conflicts==
Goal conflicts arise when the desired world states of one or more actors cannot co-exist.&lt;ref&gt;Schank, R and Abelson, R. (1977) Scripts, Plans Goals and Understanding. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be resolved by a number of techniques, which fall into three types of strategies.

===General Strategies===
* '''Block Competing Goal'''.  One actor prevents the other from achieving its goal.
* '''Priority Scheduling'''.  One actor places time priority on its goal, achieving it before the other actor realizes its goal.
* '''Goal Schedule Interference'''.  One actor delays the other actor's goal achievement.

===Diversion Strategies===
* '''Threatening Higher Level Goals'''. One actor causes a goal of another actor that is more important than the [[mutually exclusive]] goal to no longer be satisfied. This causes the other actor to focus on the higher priority goal.
* '''Dissipation of Effort'''.  One actor threatens goals of another actor, causing the other actor to apply its effort to fixing the disrupted goals rather than achieving the mutually exclusive goal.

Diversion strategies can either be applied directly or applied by [[deception|deceiving]] the other actor into thinking certain goals are threatened.

===Compromise Strategies===
* '''Partial Fulfillment'''.  Each actor partially achieves its goal.
* '''Goal Substitution'''.  One actor changes its goal to a non-mutually exclusive goal.
* '''Cooperation by Mutual Need'''.  The actors can partially fulfill their goals only by working together.
* '''Mutual Goal Abandonment'''.  If preventing the other actor from achieving its goal is more important than achieving the actor’s own goal, one may convince the other to abandon its goal.

One must also account for counterplanning techniques applied by other actors. A goal conflict counterplanning technique called "Expected Blocking" involves preventing another actor from applying the techniques described above.

==Plan Conflicts==
Plan conflicts occur when the actions of one or more actors prevent other actions from achieving their desired effect.  Plan conflicts can be analyzed on the following dimensions:
* '''Accidental versus Intentional'''.  An [[accident]]al plan conflict is when carrying out a [[plan]] inadvertently prevents another actor from completing its plan.  An [[intention]]al plan conflict is when an actor carries out a plan, knowing that it will prevent another actor’s plan from succeeding.
* '''Competitive versus Cooperative'''. A [[competition|competitive]] plan conflict occurs between actors, each of which benefit by preventing the other's success. A [[cooperation|cooperative]] plan conflict occurs between actors who benefit from each other's success.
* '''Inconvenience versus Total Blockage'''.  An inconvenient plan conflict can be resolved if one actor switches to an alternate plan which is capable of achieving the goal in question. A total blockage exists when there is no viable alternative.
* '''No Underlying Goal Conflict versus Underlying Goal Conflict'''. A plan conflict without an underlying goal conflict occurs when there is no disagreement about goal states, but accidental plan interference (as in the accidental plan conflict example above). When an underlying goal conflict exists, goal conflict mitigation strategies must be used (as in the intentional plan conflict example above).
* '''Internally versus Externally Motivated'''.  An internally motivated plan conflict arises between the actors without external interference.  An externally motivated plan conflict arises when outside forces place actors in conflict.
* '''Important Goal Threatened versus Insignificant Goal Threatened'''. Actors are more likely to focus on resolving plan conflicts when the threatened goal is important.

'''Dakhini''' or '''Dakkhani''' ({{Nastaliq|دکنی}}), also spelled '''Dakkani''' (داکھان) and '''Deccani''' (''dec-ca-ni''), is an [[Indo-Aryan language]] of South India. It arose as a language of the [[Deccan sultanates]] ca. 1300 AD in ways similar to [[Urdu]]. It is similar to Urdu in its influence from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] with a [[Prakrit language|Prakrit]] base, but differs because of the strong influence of [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada]] spoken in the states of [[Maharashtra]], [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. This dialect has a rich and extensive literary heritage. It is also the spoken form of [[Hindi-Urdu]] for many people of the region to this day and is a common "street-language" in several cities including [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Vijayawada, India|Vijayawada]], [[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Kurnool]], [[Guntur]], [[Nellore]] and [[Mangalore]]. Dakhini is the native language of the [[Dakhini Muslims]].

== Overview ==
Dakhini is spoken in the Deccan region of India. Just as [[Urdu language|Urdu]] developed in [[Lucknow]], Dakhini developed in [[Deccan plateau]] parallel to [[Urdu language|Urdu]] with [[Khari Boli]]. The term Dakhini is perhaps an umbrella for a group of [[dialect]]s spoken by certain communities of [[Muslims]] in the Deccan region.

Dakhini was the [[lingua franca]] of the Muslims of Deccan, chiefly living in [[Hyderabad state]] (including the regions ceded to the British by Nizams), and the [[Mysore state]], covering most of Deccan plateau and adjacent plains except for Moplah Muslims of Kerala and the Maricar, Rawthar and Lebbai Muslims in Tamil Nadu in the south, to the Beary Bhashe language and Konkani speaking Muslims along the western coast of Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra. Though, a minor Segment of Kerala Muslims do speak the Dakhini dialect and identify themselves as Dakhini Muslims who follow ''Hanafi Fiqh'' (Hanafi School of Islamic Jurisprudence).

Dakhni for all practical purposes today is an oral language which is flexible enough to be visually represented by different scripts like [[Devanagari]] or [[Urdu language|Urdu]] or even [[Persian language|Persian]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Dakhini was widely spoken across the Deccan peninsula with subtle changes in the dialect as you go down south away from Hyderabad ending as a heavily Tamilized version around the middle of Tamil Nadu.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Dakhini mainly spoken by the native [[Muslims]] living in these areas can also be divided into 2 dialects:
[[File:IndoEuropeanTree.svg|thumb|Dakhini in the Indo European Languages' Family Tree, is represented under Urdu, and is a Hindustani Language.]]

=== North Dakhini ===
North Dakhini is spoken in areas of Former Hyderabad State, mainly [[Hyderabad City]], [[Telangana]] (mainly [[Nizamabad, Telangana|Nizamabad]] city), [[Marathwada]] (cities of [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] and [[Nanded]]), [[Hyderabad-Karnataka]] ([[Gulbarga]], [[Bidar]] &amp; [[Raichur]] in Present day Karnataka), minority native [[Goan]] [[Konkani Muslims]] in the [[Uttara Kannada]] district of Karnataka with some variation of [[Nawayath]], and [[Goan Muslims|Goan Muslim]] dialect in [[Goa]].

=== South Dakhini ===

South Dakhini is spoken along Central [[Karnataka]], [[Bangalore]], Southern and Central [[Andhra Pradesh]] (Vijayawada, Kurnool, Kadapa, Guntur, Nellore.,etc.), North [[Tamil Nadu]], Chennai.Most of North tamilnadu districts like 
chennai, vellore, krishnagiri, dharma puri, villipuram, tiruvannamali, and scattered also in mid and south tamilnadu This form of Deccani is interlaced with the native language words of the respective regions.These were the areas under the Mysore and [[Nawab of the Carnatic|Carnatic]] sultanates. This is also the form of Dakhini spoken by the minor ''Dakhini Muslim'' community of Kerala.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

=== Differences between dialects ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}

North Dakhini is spoken with an added influence of pure standardized [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and while South Dakhini draws slightly more influences from local languages, it has quite a number of original words not to be found in Urdu or Northern Dakhini, with even a slightly varied grammar and sentence structuring. This particularly points towards possible signs that Dakhini as a language in its own sense could have evolved from the Southern parts much more than the Northern variation.

This dialect is used extensively in the spoken form; when it comes to writing and literary work, standard Urdu is used. Most Dakhini speakers are fluent in standard Urdu, as well as Dakhini, and most will put Urdu as their mother tongue on official censuses, and surveys as Dakhini has not been recognized as an official language by India.

==History==
The [[Urdu language]] from [[Delhi]] was introduced in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region during [[Alauddin Khalji]] invasion in between 1295 AD to 1316 AD{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=January 2017}}. It became more popular in the Deccan plateau during and after [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] shifted the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultanate]] capital from [[Delhi]], making the city of [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad]] the new capital in 1327 AD. As a revolt against the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultanate]], the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] was formed in 1347 AD with [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad]] as its sultanate capital. This was later moved to [[Gulbargah]] and once again, in 1430, to [[Bidar]], The [[Bahmani Sultanate]] lasted for about 150 years, expanding to almost the entire [[Deccan Plateau]] (which was then named as [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]). This shifting of power, moving of capitals, expansion of sultanate collectively propagated the Urdu language of Delhi, which came to be known as [[Deccani]] and received patronage from its rulers. It was also known through other names like ''Hinduastani'', ''Zaban Hinduastani'', ''Dehalvi'' and ''Hindawi''. The Sufis were the earliest to use ''Deccani'' in its written form. The earliest available manuscript on record is ''[[Kadam Rao Padam Rao]]'' a ''Masnavi'' of Fakhruddin Nizami, written during 1421–1434 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D. Balasubramanian Harsh K. Gupta, Aloka Parasher-Sen|first1=(Editors)|last2=Nishat|first2=Jameela (Author)|title=Deccan heritage|date=2000|publisher=Universities Press|location=Hyderabad|isbn=9788173712852|pages=201–210|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8830KZLvkYsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=%22maharashtrian+wedding%22+&amp;ots=8TPFIHKw6G&amp;sig=mSs1-EzpbMBJCnzg4nCISMDSheU#v=onepage&amp;q=dakhini&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the [[Mughals]] took over Deccan, many notable personalities, both secular and religious, settled in the Deccan and spread the language across borders that now form parts of [[Telangana]], southern [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]] and [[Goa]]. One such poet of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] region was [[Wali Deccani]] (1667–1707), the first established poet to have composed [[Ghazal]]s and compiled a divan (a collection of ghazals where the entire alphabet is used at least once as the last letter to define the rhyme pattern).

== Legacy ==
Dakhini has plenty of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] evolved loanwords,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=InpaperMagazine|first1=From|title=Language: Urdu and the borrowed words|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/672945|website=DAWN.COM|accessdate=28 February 2018|date=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the fact that the ancestors of its people were of Malmuk origin, although most of the Dakhini population of Karnataka has above 90 percentage of Dravidian genes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rajkumar|first1=Revathi|last2=Kashyap|first2=VK|title=Genetic structure of four socio-culturally diversified caste populations of southwest India and their affinity with related Indian and global groups|journal=BMC Genetics|date=19 August 2004|volume=5|pages=23|doi=10.1186/1471-2156-5-23|pmc=515297|issn=1471-2156}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It is similar to [[Urdu literature|Urdu]] in its influence from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] with a [[Prakrit language|Prakrit]] base, but differs because of the strong influence of [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada]] spoken in the states of [[Maharashtra]], [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. This language, which is often mistaken as a dialect of Urdu, has a rich and extensive literary herite, the most important being [http://samharshbangalore.blogspot.ae/2012/10/kitab-e-nauras.html?m=1 Kitab-E-Navras] - revered for its transcendence beyond Secularism (A first for India), and [[Kadam Rao Padam Rao]], the book that created Rekhta, which has since then evolved to become the Heart &amp; Soul of Music in India, especially Bollywood. Dakhini has directly lead to the evolution of what is now modern [[Sufism]], which since then has spread throughout the World. Such was its impact that even the Mughals who had come to destroy Dakhini fell in love with it.

Despite it being the native language of most [[Muslims]] of the erstwhile [[Deccan sultanates]] and later of the [[Princely States]] of [[Hyderabad State]] (including the regions ceded to the British by Nizams) and the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], it is also the spoken form of [[Hindi-Urdu]] for most [[Hindu]]s and non-[[Hindu]]s of the region to this day and is the most common "street-language" in several cities including [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Vijayawada]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Kurnool]], [[Guntur]], [[Nellore]] and [[Mangalore]].

Dakhini is the native language of the [[Dakhini Muslims]], although there are some non-Muslims of this ethnicity as well but they are negligible. Hyderabadi people pronounce their language as 'Dakani' and Bengluri folks, not the city, but the ethnicity, pronounce it as 'Dakhni'. This includes all descendant Dakhini population of the erstwhile Mysore State, although some consider themselves Mysuri. Also, people from the old Hyderabad Princely state ruled by the Nizams call themselves Hyderabadi.

===Dakhini and Hindustani===

Dakhini, though built on a base of Khadi Boli, influenced the development of [[Urdu]] (also known as Hindustani, Hindavi, or [[Rekhta]]). This was achieved primarily through the continual interaction of Sufi poets, courtesans and public between the Deccan and the Mughal Courts and the Khadi Boli heartland. Hyderabad was the southernmost city of North India. Noteworthy are the contributions of Wali Dakhni (also known as Wali Aurangabadi and Wali Gujarati), a famous poet of Dakhni, who visited Delhi in 1700. He astonished the poets of Delhi with his ghazals. He drew wide applause from the Persian-speaking poets, some of whom, after listening to Wali, also adopted the language of the people, ‘Urdu’, as the medium of their poetic expressions. Prominent poets—Shah Hatem, Shah Abro and Mir Taqi Mir—were among his admirers.

At that time in Delhi, the court poets were composing in Persian and Arabic. For others, Braj and Awadhi were the languages of literary and religious expressions. The spoken language of all was Khadi Boli. When the poets listened to Wali in Dakhni language (which is also a variant of Khari Boli) they were struck by the fact that the spoken language of the people was capable of such rich literary expression. These events were important for they hastened the adoption of Urdu over Khadi Boli, in the early 18th century, as the language for literary and religious expression (in which Dakhini played the role of a catalyst).&lt;ref name="bangalorenotes"&gt;http://www.bangalorenotes.com/dakhni.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2016}}

===Dakhini and Hindi===
A twentieth-century Kerala Hindi scholar, Dr. Muhammad Kunj Mettar, established Dakhini as a source for modern Hindi.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Dr. [[Suniti Kumar Chattopadhyay]] also maintained that it was Dakhini that established the use of Khari Boli replacing Braj in the North. In fact, even the name Hindi for the language originated in the South. A Tamil, Kazi Mahamud Bahari, used the word Hindi for Dakhini in the 17th century in his Sufi poem ''Man Lagan''. Renaming Dakhini as Hindi was probably a symbolic gesture by him to extend the geographical reach of this language.&lt;ref name="bangalorenotes" /&gt;{{better source|date=December 2016}}

==Classification==

Dakhini is part of the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] grouping of the [[Indo-European languages]]. The Dakhini language has puzzled linguists for years, and its specific classification is a confusing subject, it could be a direct descendant, or sister language of Urdu, or be a Persianization of the Marathi language. It was also declared as the National language of the former defunct [[Hyderabad State]].

==Geographic distribution==

Most speakers of Dakhini live in the [[India]]n region known as the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. They inhabit the regions comprising the erstwhile Muslim kingdoms in Deccan Plateau viz. portions of the states of [[Telangana]], southern [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Goa]], [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. They can be collectively be known as [[Dakhini Muslims]], and include subgroups like the [[Hyderabadi Muslims]].

===Dialects===

Other than the Northern, including [[Hyderabadi Urdu|Hyderabadi]], and Southern, dialects of Dakhini include Savji bhasha i.e. the language of the [[Savji]] community in the Hubli, Dharwad, Gadag, Bijapur, Belgaum region.

== Deccani Film Industry ==

The Deccani Film Industry is based in [[Hyderabad|Hyderabad, India]], and its movies are produced in [[Hyderabadi Urdu]], a dialect of Deccani.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/06/deccanwood-indian-film-industry-bollywood-160623102912455.html|title=Deccanwood: An Indian film industry taking on Bollywood|last=Mumtaz|first=Roase|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic groups==
[[File:Family trip.jpg|thumb|300px|A family in [[Djenné]], Mali.]]

Ethnic groups include:&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ml.html|title= Africa :: MALI|publisher= CIA The World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bambara people|Bambara]] 34.1%, [[Fula people|Fulani]] ({{lang-fr|link=no|Peul}}; {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}) 14.7%, [[Soninke people|Sarakole]] 10.8%, [[Senufo people|Senufo]] 10.5%, [[Dogon people|Dogon]] 8.9%, [[Malinke people|Malinke]] 8.7%, [[Bobo people|Bobo]] 2.9%, [[Songhai people|Songhai]] 1.6%, [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] 0.9%, other Malian 6.1%, [[ECOWAS]] citizens 0.3%, other 0.4%

[[Mali]]'s population consists of [[Sub-Saharan]] [[ethnic groups]], sharing similar historic, cultural, and religious traditions. Exceptions are two [[nomad]]ic northern groups, the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]s, a [[Berber people]], and [[Moors#Present-day Moors|Maur]]s (or Moors), of [[Arab]]o-Berber origins. In Mali and [[Niger]], the Moors are also known as [[Azawagh Arabs]], named after the [[Azawagh]] region of the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;For an introduction to the culture of the ''Azawagh Arabs'', see Rebecca Popenoe, ''Feeding Desire — Fatness, Beauty and Sexuality among a Saharan People''. Routledge, London (2003) {{ISBN|0-415-28096-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azawagh Arabs speak mainly [[Hassaniya Arabic]] which is one of the regional [[varieties of Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;Popenoe (2003), p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tuaregs traditionally have opposed the central government. Starting in June 1990 in the north, Tuaregs seeking greater autonomy led to clashes with the military. In April 1992, the government and most opposing factions signed a pact to end the fighting and restore stability in the north. Its major aims are to allow greater autonomy to the north and increase government resource allocation to what has been a traditionally impoverished region. The peace agreement was celebrated in 1996 in [[Timbuktu]] during an official and highly publicized ceremony called "Flamme de la Paix"--(peace flame).

Historically, interethnic relations throughout the rest of the country were facilitated by easy mobility on the [[Niger River]] and across the country's vast savannahs. Each ethnic group was traditionally tied to a specific occupation, all working within proximity to each other, although the distinctions were often blurred.

The [[Bambara people|Bambara]], [[Mandinka people|Malinké]], [[Soninke people|Sarakole]], [[Dogon people|Dogon]] and [[Songhai people|Songhay]] are farmers; the [[Fula people|Fula or Fulani]], [[Moors|Maur]], and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] are herders, while the [[Bozo people|Bozo]] are fishers. In recent years this linkage has shifted considerably, as ethnic groups seek nontraditional sources of income.

Mixed European/African descendants of Muslims of [[Spanish people|Spanish]], as well some French, Irish, Italian and Portuguese origins live in Mali, they are known as the [[Arma people]] (1% of the nation's population). &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.ma/books?id=q3mx8aAo6x0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration and emigration==
Mali had an estimated [[net migration rate]] of –6.6 migrants per 1,000 people in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;CIA factbook&lt;/ref&gt; About 3 million Malians are believed to reside in Côte d'Ivoire and France. Conversely, according to a 2003 estimate, Mali hosts about 11,000 Mauritanians; most are Fulani herders who routinely engage in cross-border migration. In addition, there are several thousand refugees from Côte d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone, and Liberia in Bamako and other urban areas of Mali.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

==Languages==
{{main article|Languages of Mali}}

Although each ethnic group [[Languages of Mali|speaks a separate language]], nearly 80% of Malians communicate over ethnic borders in [[Bambara language|Bambara]], which is the common language of the [[marketplace]]. French is the country's official language and is spoken somewhat by 30% of Malians.

==Religion==
{{main article|Religion in Mali}}

An estimated 90% of Malians are [[Islam in Mali|Muslim]] (mostly [[Sunni]]), 9% adhere to [[African traditional religion|indigenous or traditional animist beliefs]], and 1% are Christian (about two-thirds [[Roman Catholicism in Mali|Roman Catholic]] and one-third [[Protestant]]).&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; [[Atheism]] and [[agnosticism]] are believed to be rare among Malians, most of whom practice their religion on a daily basis.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Islam as practiced in Mali can be moderate, tolerant, and adapted to local conditions; relations between Muslims and practitioners of minority religious faiths are generally amicable.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; The constitution establishes a [[secular state]] and provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the government largely respects this right.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

==Health==
{{main article|Health in Mali}}
Mali's health and development indicators rank among the worst in the world. In 2000 only 62–65 percent of the population was estimated to have access to safe drinking water and only 69 percent to sanitation services of some kind; only 8 percent was estimated to have access to modern sanitation facilities. Only 20 percent of the nation’s villages and livestock watering holes had modern water facilities.&lt;ref name = cp/&gt;

There were an estimated 140,000 cases of [[human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (HIV/AIDS) reported in 2003, and an estimated 1.9 percent of the adult population was afflicted with HIV/AIDS that year, among the lowest rates in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (see also [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]]).&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; In the same year, there were 12,000 AIDS deaths. The [[infant mortality rate]] is 69.5 deaths/1,000 live births (75.3/1,000 among males and 63.5/1,000 among females) (2017 est.). Life expectancy at birth is 60.3 years (58.2 years among males and 62.5 years among females) (2017 est.).

==Education==
{{main article|Education in Mali}}
In the 2000–01 school year, the primary school enrollment rate was 61% (71% of males and 51% of females). The primary school completion rate is also low: only 36 percent of students in 2003 (and lower for females). The majority of students reportedly leave school by age 12. In the late 1990s, the secondary school enrollment rate was 15% percent (20% of males and 10% of females).&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Mali.pdf Mali country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (January 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[United States]] government estimates, the adult [[literacy]] rate (defined as those over age 15 who can read and write) was 46.4 percent for the total population in 2003 (53.5 percent for males and 39.6 percent for females). According to [[United Nations]] sources, however, the literacy rate is actually much lower—only 27–30 percent overall and as low as 12 percent for females, among the lowest rates in [[Africa]].

'''Examples of feudalism''' are helpful to fully understand [[feudalism]] and [[feudal society]]. Feudalism was practiced in many different ways, depending on location and time period, thus a high-level encompassing conceptual definition does not always provide a reader with the intimate understanding that detailed historical examples provide.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Western European Feudalism==

===12th century England===

Feudalism in 12th century [[England]] was among the better structured and established in Europe at the time. However, it could be structurally complex, which is illustrated by the example of the [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]] of [[Stafford]] as described in a survey  of knight's fees made in 1166 and recorded in ''The [[Black Book of the Exchequer]]''. This  was a  roll of parchment or several such,  recording the quantity and tenant of each knight's fee held ''in capite''. It was a record commissioned by the [[Treasury]] as the knight's fee was the primary basis for assessing certain types of taxation, for example, feudalism is the exchange of land for military service, thus everything was based on what was called the [[knight's fee]], which is a fiefdom or [[Estate (law)|estate of land]]. A [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]] contained several knight's fees, for example the baron   [[Robert de Stafford|Robert of Stafford]] held a barony containing   60 knight's fees. Often lords were not so much lords presiding over great estates, but managers of a network of tenants and sub-leases.

Stafford tenants were themselves [[lord of the manor|lords of the manors]] they held from him, which is altogether different from their being [[English feudal barony|barons]]. Henry d'Oilly, who held 3 fees from Robert of Stafford, also held, as a [[tenant-in-chief]], over 30 fees elsewhere that had been granted to him directly by the king. Thus while Henry was the vassal of his overlord Robert, Henry was himself a lord of his own manors held [[Tenant-in-chief|''in capite'']] and [[subinfeudation|sub-enfeoffed]] many of his manors which he did not keep [[Demesne|in demesne]], that is to say under his own management using simple employees. It would  also have been possible and not uncommon for a situation where Robert of Stafford was a vassal of Henry elsewhere, creating the condition of mutual lordship/vassalage between the two.  These complex relationships invariably created loyalty problems through conflicts of interests. To resolve this the concept of a [[liege lord]] existed, which meant that the vassal was loyal to his liege lord above all others, except the king himself,  no matter what. However, even this sometimes broke down when a vassal would pledge himself to more than one liege lord.

From the perspective of the smallest land holder, multiple networks of tenancy were layered on the same small plot of land. A chronicle of the time says "different lordships lay on the land in different respects". Each tenant laid claim to a certain aspect of the service from the land.

===11th century France===

Among the complexities of feudal arrangements, there existed no guarantee that contracts between [[lord]] and [[vassal]] would be honored, and feudal contracts saw little enforcement from those with greater authority. This often resulted in the wealthier and more powerful party taking advantage of the weaker.

Such was (allegedly) the case of [[Hugh IV of Lusignan|Hugh de Lusignan]] and his relations with his lord [[William V of Aquitaine]]. Between 1020 and 1025 Hugh wrote or possibly dictated a complaint against William and his vassals describing the unjust treatment he had received at the hands of both. Hugh describes a convoluted intermingling of loyalties that was characteristic of the period and instrumental in developing strain between nobles that resulted in competition for each other's land. According to Hugh's account, William wronged him on numerous occasions, often to the benefit of William's vassals. Many of his properties suffered similar fates: seized by opponents and divided between them and William. William apparently neglected to send military aid to Hugh when necessary and dealt most unfairly in the exchange of [[hostage]]s. Each time Hugh reclaimed one of his properties, William ordered him to return it to whomever had recently taken it from him. William broke multiple [[oath]]s in succession yet Hugh continued to put faith in his lord's word, to his own ruin. In his last contract with William, over possession of his uncle's castle at Chiza, Hugh dealt in no uncertain terms and with frank language:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Hugh''': You are my lord, I will not accept a pledge from you, but I will simply rely on the mercy of God and yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
'''William''': Give up all those claims over which you have quarreled with me in the past and swear fidelity to me and my son and I will give you your uncle's honor [Chizes] or something else of equal value in exchange for it.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Hugh''': My lord, I beg you through God and this blessed crucifix which is made in the figure of Christ that you do not make me do this if you and your son were intending to threaten me with trickery.&lt;br /&gt;
'''William''': On my honor and my son I will do this without trickery.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Hugh''': And when I shall have sworn fidelity to you, you will demand Chizes castle of me, and if I should not turn it over to you, you will say that it is not right that I deny you the castle which I hold from you, and if I should turn it over to you, you and your son will seize it because you have given nothing in pledge except the mercy of God and yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
'''William''': We will not do that, but if we should demand it of you, don't turn it over to us.&lt;ref name="Agreements Between Lord and Vassal"&gt;Geary, P 2010, ''Readings in Medieval History, Fourth Edition'', University of Toronto, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While perhaps an embellishment of the truth for the sake of Hugh's cause, and not necessarily a microcosm of the feudal system everywhere, the ''Agreement Between Lord and Vassal'' is evidence at least of corruption in feudal rule.

=== Holy Roman Empire ===
{{main article|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}

===Portugal===
Portugal, originally a part of the [[Kingdom of León]], was an example of a [[feudal society]], according to [[Marc Bloch]].&lt;ref name=PortugalBloch/&gt;

Portugal has its roots in a feudal state in northern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], the [[County of Portugal]], established in 868 within the [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. The [[Vímara Peres]], the local counts dynasty, was suppressed in 1071, but twenty two years later, in 1093, King [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alphonse VI of Léon and Castille]] gave the county as a [[fiefdom]] to [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] (a younger [[Capetian dynasty|Capet]] who was participating in the [[reconquista]]), when he married [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Theresa]], the king’s natural daughter.

In spite of their [[vassal]] link, Henry had a remarkable autonomy, especially after his father-in law's death in 1109. The [[The establishment of the monarchy in Portugal|Portuguese independence]] was obtained by his son, [[Afonso I of Portugal]] when, after defeating the Muslims at the [[Battle of Ourique]], proclaimed himself [[Kings of portugal|King of Portugal]] in 1139, cutting definitively all feudal bonds with the Kingdom of León. Upon seeing the weakness of feudal society due to the Muslim invasion, Portugal became independent from the Kingdom of León as Castile had done a century earlier.&lt;ref name=PortugalBloch&gt;[[Marc Bloch]], ''Feudal Society Vol.2'', Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Semi-feudal" (non-Western European) feudalism==

Outside of a medieval European historical context, the concept of feudalism is generally used by analogy (called '''semi-feudal'''), most often in discussions of [[Japan]] under the ''[[shōgun]]s'', and, sometimes, nineteenth-century [[Ethiopia]]. However, some have taken the feudalism analogy further, seeing it in places as diverse as [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Parthia|Parthian empire]], [[Indian feudalism|India]], and the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era (1781–1860)|American South of the nineteenth century]].

===Byzantine Empire===
{{Main article|Pronoia}}
[[Pronoia]], the 11th-century system of land grants in the [[Byzantine empire]], makes a useful contrast to feudal tenure in the European West. Another distinction between the European West can be made in that paroiki (people who lived and farmed on the land of the Pronoiars) owed no debt or loyalty to the pronoiars (the recipients of the Pronoia).&lt;ref name="Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire, 900-1200"&gt;Harvey, Allen (1989) Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire, 900–1200 pp.1–13&lt;/ref&gt; This system was adopted by [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] and then the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the fall of the Byzantine Empire at their hands, which called their land grants ''[[timar]]'' and the recipients of the land grants "[[timariots]]".

===Russia===
{{Main article|Muscovite Manorialism}}
In contrast to Western [[Europe]] where feudalism created a strong central power, it took a strong central power to develop feudalism in Russia. A lack of true central power weakened and doomed the Russians to outside domination. The Russians developed its system of land/lord/worker, loosely called feudalism, after it had created a strong central power. Lacking a feudal system of [[vassal]] loyalty made it impossible for any prince, early on, to gain enough influence and power to project a strong force against any invaders.

In contrast to other European forms of [[serfdom]] and [[feudalism]] there was a lack of vassalage and loyalty to the lord whose land the serfs worked. It took a much longer period of time for feudalism to develop but when it did it took on a much harsher form than elsewhere in Europe. Serfs had no rights whatsoever; they could be traded like livestock by their lords. They had no ownership of anything, including their own families, all of which belonged to their lord.

Another major difference was the lack of independent principalities; this was due to the lack of vassalage. As separate lords did not command their own troops to protect their own lands.&lt;ref name="Blum"&gt;Blum, Jerome, Lord and Peasant in Russia. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armenia===
{{Main article|Nakharar}}
The [[Nakharar]] system used by the [[Armenian nobility]] throughout [[Medieval Armenia]] has often been described as feudal, with hereditary houses of nobles owning large estates, each headed by its own [[tanuter]], and with the estates themselves divided amongst the family. For Armenia as a whole, a [[Sparapet]] (supreme commander), King, and chief [[Aspet]] were each taken from individual noble houses. However, Armenian feudalism differs from the feudalism of most of Europe as the estates were owned by families, not lords, and could not be split or given without the family's permission. Also, if a [[tanuter]] died heirless, he was succeeded by a different branch of the family, rather than by a noble who was sworn to him. [[Cilician Armenia]], through contact with [[crusader state]]s, had a system even closer to western feudalism.

The [[Taluqdar]]i or [[Zamindar]]i system is often referred to as a feudal or feudal-like system. Originally the system was introduced in the pre-colonial period to collect taxes from peasants, and it continued during colonial British rule. After independence Zamindari was abolished in [[India]] and East Pakistan (present day [[Bangladesh]]), but it is still present today in the state of [[Pakistan]]. In modern times historians have become very reluctant to classify other societies into European models and today it is rare for Zamindari to be described as feudal by academics; it still done in popular usage, however, but only for pejorative reasons to express disfavour, typically by critics of the system.

===China===
{{main article|Feudalism in China}}
The [[People's Republic of China]] is officially a [[Communist state|Marxist–Leninist society and state]], based on ''[[Socialism with Chinese Characteristics]]'' under a [[people's democratic dictatorship]],&lt;!-- citations available via wikilinks --&gt; and attempts have been made by Marxist academics to record China's history in the PRC. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In China, Feudal Answers for Modern Problems|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/opinion/yu-in-china-feudal-answers-for-modern-problems.html|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feudalism is the model that modern Chinese Marxists and [[Tokyo school]] historians use to identify China's recent past, [[Neologism|neologized]] from the Chinese concept of ''[[fengjian]]''&lt;ref name="BrookBlue2002" /&gt; (which means to allocate a region or piece of land to an individual, establishing him as the ruler of that region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levenson, Schurmann|first=Joseph, Franz|title=China-An Interpretive History: From the Beginnings to the Fall of Han|year=1969|publisher=Regents of the University of California|location=London, England|isbn=0-520-01440-5|pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a term used to designate the multi-state which existed in China under the [[Zhou dynasty]], and was eradicated by the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]],&lt;ref name="BrookBlue2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Timothy Brook|author2=Gregory Blue|title=China and Historical Capitalism: Genealogies of Sinological Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAFF94exLscC&amp;pg=PA136|date=5 September 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52591-6|page=136|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which time the [[state of Qin]] had conquered all other states and established the [[Qin dynasty|first China-wide empire]]. After [[King Wu of Zhou]] defeated the [[Shang dynasty]], he created five hereditary ranks; 公 ''gōng'', 侯 ''hóu'', 伯 ''bó'', 子 ''zǐ'' and 男 ''nán'', commonly translated as Duke, Marquis, Earl (or Count), Viscount and Baron. However, unlike their Western European equivalents, the titles often indicated more in the way of perceived nobility rather than amount of land possessed. For example, the Lords of the eventually huge states of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu]] were known as "Earls" and "Viscounts", while the Lord of [[Song (state)|Song]] was given the title of "Duke" on the merits of his descent from the previous Shang royal lineage, rather than his level of power.  Ancient Chinese texts can sometimes cause confusion as it was also considered to be polite to address rulers as ''gōng'' regardless of their actual rank. As the Zhou dynasty's control weakened, the regional magnates caused further title inflation by referring to themselves as Kings; the inflation was such that under the [[Han dynasty]], many local lords were established with the title of "king"; in imperial China, the character is thus more normally rendered as "prince".

The [[Zhou Dynasty]] can be seen as a true feudal system as it is in many respects very similar to the system used in [[Medieval Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Zhou Dynasty|url=http://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/whychina/zhou.php|website=China Education Center Limited|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each lord was given land, and his power was legitimised by nominal allegiance to the central Zhou king; politics thus revolved around these noble households. In fact, the notion of "prime minister" 太宰 in ancient Chinese came from the feudal time meaning the "chief housekeeper" or "butler" of the noble household, in a similar way to the development of such European titles as "[[constable]]". Each feudal state was governed independently with taxes, currency and laws set by each individual household, but the nobles were required to pay regular homage to the Zhou Kings as an act of [[fealty]]. At the time of war the nobles were required to provide armed service to the King.  Approaching the end of the [[Zhou dynasty]], the power of the King dwindled while the power of the nobles had risen. This resulted in what is known as the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Warring States]] periods when the nobles fought each other constantly for supremacy. This resulted in the collapse of the noble ranking system, with the feudally organised society of the Springs and Autumns largely replaced by more bureaucratised states with standing armies, who no longer paid any attention to the Zhou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gernet|first1=Jacques|title=Ancient China – from beginnings to Empire|date=1964|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|location=London|pages=99, 105–6, 115, 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After King Ying Zheng of Qin, known to posterity as the [[First Emperor of Qin]], defeated his rival states, deposing the Zhou and founding the [[Qin dynasty|first empire]], he formally abolished the largely defunct feudal system, replacing it with a bureaucratised system of literate civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loewe|first1=Michael|title=The Government of Qin and Han Empires|date=2006|publisher=Hackett|location=Indianapolis|pages=21, 37, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the rapid collapse of the Qin and an abortive attempt at reinstitution of feudalism by [[Xiang Yu]], the following [[Han dynasty]] maintained the vast majority of his bureaucratic reforms, establishing them as the new standard of government for the next two thousand years of imperial Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Mark|title=The Early Chinese Empires|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Han Confucian scholarship would decry the First Emperor as a tyrant whose "crimes against humanity" included removing feudalism, looked back on as integral to the idealised society of the [[Western Zhou]], feudalism in the sense of devolved power for a military elite would not again be implemented in China.

===Tibet===
{{Main article|Serfdom in Tibet controversy}}
Whether Tibet constituted a feudal social system or if peasants can be considered serfs is still debated.&lt;ref name="TibetBarnett"&gt;Barnett, Robert (2008) ''What were the conditions regarding human rights in Tibet before democratic reform?'' in: Authenticating Tibet: Answers to China’s 100 Questions, pp. 81–83. Eds. Anne-Marie Blondeau and Katia Buffetrille. University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-520-24464-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|978-0-520-24928-8}} (paper)&lt;/ref&gt; Studied districts of Tibet between the 17th and 20th century show evidence of a striated society with land ownership laws and tax responsibility that resemble European feudal systems. However, scholars have pointed out key differences that make the comparison contested and only limited evidence from that period is available for study.&lt;ref&gt;Childs, Geoff. 2003. "Polyandry and population growth in a Historical Tibetan Society", History of the Family, pp.423–428&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Geoff Samuel further argued that Tibet even in the early 20th century did not constitute a single state but rather a collection of districts and a legal system of Lhasa with particular land and tax laws did not extend over the entire country.&lt;ref name="TibetSamuel"&gt;Samuel, Geoffrey (Feb., 1982) ''Tibet as a Stateless Society and Some Islamic Parallels'' The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 41, No. 2, pp. 215–229&lt;/ref&gt;
However, according to [[Melvyn Goldstein]], for the 20th century, the Tibetan political system can not be categorized as feudal.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Goldstein, On the Nature of Tibetan Peasantry, The Tibet journal, Vol, XIII, n 1, 1988, 61–65 Citation : "I did not argue in the paper in question that the Tibetan political system of the 20th century should be categorized as a feudal system, and in fact, have specifically rejected that argument in dissertation and in a later paper in which I argued that Tibet possessed a centralized type of state."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The [[Tokugawa shogunate]] was a feudal military dictatorship of Japan established in the 17th century lasting until 1868. It marks a period often referred to loosely as 'feudal Japan', otherwise known as the [[Edo period]]. While modern historians have become very reluctant to classify other societies into European models, in Japan, the system of land tenure and a vassal receiving tenure in exchange for an oath of [[fealty]] is very close to what happened in parts of medieval Europe, and thus the term is sometimes used in connection with Japan.&lt;ref&gt;John Whitney Hall, "Feudalism in Japan—a reassessment," ''Comparative studies in Society and History'' (1962) 5#1 pp: 15–51 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/177767 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Friday notes that in the 21st century, historians of Japan rarely invoke feudalism; instead of looking at similarities, specialists attempting comparative analysis concentrate on fundamental differences.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Friday,  "The Futile Paradigm: In Quest of Feudalism in Early Medieval Japan," ''History Compass'' 8.2 (2010): 179–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern traces of feudalism==

===Scotland===
Scots law is quite different from English law. One scholar explained it in 1924 as following: 
:It is a law of Roman and feudal origin which has been adapted in the course of eight centuries by legislation and by judicial decisions to the needs of the Scottish people, and during the last century has, little by little, been combining with the English law by a slow operation of fusion.&lt;ref&gt;H Lévy-Ullmann "The Law of Scotland" (1925) 37 ''Juridical Review'' 370-91, quoted in Hector MacQueen, "Private Law, National Identity and the Case of Scotland" (2012) p 12 [http://www.glasgowsciencefestival.org.uk/media/media_247741_en.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of land tenure in Scotland was until recently feudal in nature. In theory, this meant that the land was held under [[The Crown]] as ultimate feudal superior. Historically, [[The Crown]] would make a grant of land in return for military or other services and the grantees would in turn make sub-grants for other services and so on. Those making grants – the "superiors" – retained a legal interest in the land ("dominium directum"), and so a hierarchical structure was created with each property having a number of owners, co-existing simultaneously. Only one of these, the [[vassal]], has what in normal language would be regarded as ownership of the property ("dominium utile").

In the 18th century, peasants were dispossessed of the land to which they were bonded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Douglas Selkirk]] (1805) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LOsRAAAAIAAJ Observations on the Present State of the Highlands of Scotland]'' pp.31–54,&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]] abolished the feudal system of land tenure in Scotland and replaced it with a system of outright ownership of land.  Since the Act became fully effective from 28 November 2004, the [[vassal]] owns the land outright, and superiority interests disappeared. The right of feudal superiors to enforce conditions was ended, subject to certain saving provisions of a restricted nature. [[Feu (land tenure)|Feu]] duty was abolished although compensation may be payable. The delay between [[Royal assent]] and coming into force was a result of the great number of transitional arrangements needed to be put into place before final abolition and because of the close relation that the 2000 Act has to the Title Conditions Act 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyle|first=Alan E.|title=Human Rights and Scots Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZSSuFFsD_QC&amp;pg=PA287|year=2002|publisher=Hart Publishing|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
Unique in England, the village of [[Laxton, Nottinghamshire|Laxton]] in [[Nottinghamshire]] continues to retain some vestiges of the feudal system, where the land is still farmed using the [[open field system]].  The feudal court now only meets annually, with its authority now restricted to management of the farmland.&lt;ref&gt;J. V. Beckett, ''A History of Laxton: England's Last Open Field Village'' (Oxford, 1989), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sark===
The tiny island of [[Sark]], in the [[Channel Islands]], was arguably the last feudal state in Europe, up until April 9, 2008. The island was a fiefdom of the larger nearby island of [[Guernsey]] and administered independently by a [[List of Seigneurs of Sark|Seigneur]], who was a vassal to the land's owner – the Queen of the United Kingdom. Sark's ruling body voted on 4 October 2006 to replace the remaining tenement seats in Chief Pleas with a fully elected democratic government. This was implemented on April 9, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Ewen and Allan R. de Carteret, ''The Fief of Sark'' (Guernsey: Guernsey Press, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haji Mastan''' (1 March 1926 {{ndash}} 25 June 1994), popularly known as '''Haji Mastan''', '''Bawa''', or '''Sultan''', was an [[Organized crime in India|Indian gangster]], smuggler, film financier and real estate businessman. Mastan was a [[Labbay]] [[Tamil Muslim]] who was born in the [[Madras Presidency]] (now [[Tamil Nadu]]), but lived and operated in [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai) for much of his life. Mastan was known to be a good politician and a successful businessman{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. He had a stranglehold over the smuggling business in Bombay for almost two decades and made a fortune. He was a very powerful man at his time{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

Mastan  was the first Bombay smuggler  to achieve a sort of celebrity status{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. He would be often seen at parties and functions rubbing shoulders with politicians, [[Bollywood]] actors and businessmen. He often wore completely white clothes and shoes, smoked expensive cigarettes and drove a white [[Mercedes Benz]]. He often helped people{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. He has many malayali friends in dongri This made him an icon among the poor and uneducated [[Muslim]] youth in the [[ghetto]] areas of [[South Mumbai]], namely [[Bhendi Bazaar]], [[Dongri]] and [[Nagpada]]. He was also held in high regard in poor [[Tamil people|Tamil]] communities in [[Matunga]], [[Sion, Mumbai|Sion]], [[Dharavi]] and [[Koliwada]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.&lt;ref name=TOI1&gt;{{cite news|title=When Tamil dons ruled Bombay|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/When-Tamil-dons-ruled-Bombay/articleshow/49623540.cms|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=2 November 2015|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Haji Mastan was born in 1926 in [[Tamil Muslim]] family [[Panaikulam]], near [[Ramanathapuram]], in the [[Madras Presidency]], [[British India]] (now [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]). He lived in the coastal town of [[Cuddalore]], Tamil Nadu, before migrating to [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai).&lt;ref name=TOI1 /&gt; At the age of 8, he migrated there with his father.

Mastan started doing odd jobs as a small boy in Crawford Market and later joined the dock and started working long hours in the dock as a small boy. In his early twenties, due to high import duty in gold, people started smuggling gold from overseas. As he was already working in the docks it made it easier for him to pass through it and then Mastan started his own business. Mastan began making a neat sum of money by diverting his sectors in business. At an early age he went on Hajj, and thereafter came to be referred as Haji Mastan.

== Later life &amp; Death ==
Mastan joined hands with Sukkur Narayan Bakhia, a smuggler from Daman to control the contraband smuggled into Mumbai and Daman from [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|countries in the Persian Gulf]]. Mastan purchased properties at various locations in South Bombay including  sea-facing bungalow at [[Peddar Road]] with his new-found wealth. He lived in a small room built on the terrace of his bungalow.

Mastan ventured into film financing later in life, providing producers in Mumbai with much needed funds. He eventually turned into a film producer himself. He also had business interests in real estate, electronic goods and hotels. He owned several electronic shops in Musafir Khana near Crawford Market.

Mastan maintained good relations with the other gang leaders. When inter-gang rivalry in Mumbai began increasing, he called all top gang leaders together and split Mumbai between the gangs so that they could operate without coming into conflict.

Later in life, Mastan  did not take a direct role in running his gang, instead he depended on lieutenants like [[Karim Lala]] and [[Varadarajan Mudaliar]] to carry out his smuggling operations and intimidate rivals and debtors. Mastan was especially close to fellow gangster Varadarajan as they both hailed from Tamil Nadu. When Varadarajan died in Tamil Nadu, Mastan  hired a private chartered plane to bring his body to Mumbai for final rites. Mastan had many acquaintances in Bollywood such as [[Dilip Kumar]], [[Raj Kapoor]], [[Dharmendra]], [[Feroz Khan (actor)|Feroz Khan]] and [[Sanjeev Kumar]].

During the [[Indian Emergency (1975 - 77)| Indian Emergency]], he was imprisoned. Whilst in prison, he was influenced by the ideals of politician [[Jaiprakash Narayan]] and also began learning [[Hindi language|Hindi]].

After his release from prison , Mastan entered politics and formed a political  party in 1980-81 and renamed it as '''Dalit Muslim Surakhsha Maha Sangh''' in 1985. 

Mastan died of cardiac arrest on 25th June 1994.

== Personal life ==
Haji mastan had no children but he did informally adopt Sundar Shaekhar. Shaekhar runs Hussain's political party, now renamed 'Bharatiya Minorities Suraksha Mahasangh'. Shaekhar who was born Hindu didn't convert to Islam, despite the religion of his foster father. Nonetheless, Hussain reportedly nicknamed him "Suleman Mirza".&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-haji-mastan-s-daughter-serves-legal-notice-on-don-s-adopted-son-1141642 | title=Aaquib Hussain’s daughter serves legal notice on Don’s ‘adopted son’|last=Singh|first=Naveeta|date=27 December 2007|work=dnaindia.com|location=Mumbai, India|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
The 1975 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Deewaar]]'' was loosely based on Haji Mastan's life, with [[Amitabh Bachchan]] portraying a fictionalized version of him. ''Deewaar'' was later remade into a 1981 [[Tamil film]], ''[[Thee (1981 film)|Thee]]'', starring [[Rajinikanth]] in the same role.

The 2010 film ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai]]'' was heavily based on Haji Mastan's life, although it was also partially fictionalized. [[Ajay Devgn]] portrayed the character of Haji Mastan (as ''Sultan Mirza'') in the film, while [[Emraan Hashmi]] portrays underworld don [[Dawood Ibrahim]] (as ''Shoaib Khan'').

On 25 May 2017, it was announced [[Rajnikanth]]'s forthcoming film will be ''[[Kaala (2018 film)|Kala Karikalan]]'' (released 2018) which is believed to be based on Mastan. His foster son Sundar Shekar Mishra sent a notice to Rajinikanth when he learned of this. In response, Wunderbar Films issued a statement clarifying that the film is not based on Mastan's life.

The '''Hobby Club''' was established in New York City in 1908 as an exclusive gentleman's club for people with an amateur's hobby or special interest. The original number of members could not be more than 50 men. In effect, this was an opportunity to showcase their special "[[Cabinet of curiosities]]" and special collections of armour, coins, precious stones and [[Incunable]] to the other members at their annual dinners.

According to its constitution, "This Club shall be called THE HOBBY CLUB. The object of the Club shall be to encourage the collection of literary, artistic and scientific works; to aid in the development of literary, artistic and scientific matters; to promote social and literary intercourse among its members, and the discussion and consideration of various literary and economic subjects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101060744370 Annals of the Hobby Club of New York City, 1912-1920].&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Hobby Club, incorporated by a number of well-known New Yorkers, will hold its first dinner at the [[Metropolitan Club]] on the evening of Dec. 28. The club's membership is limited to fifty, and to become eligible one must mount some well defined hobby. So enthusiastic have the members become that it is now planned to give dinners, at which the hobbies will be discussed, at least once a month until April. There is even talk about building a clubhouse. That the organization will be a success seems assured, as scores have sought to become members."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/12/17/104886809.pdf Riders of Hobbies to Dine each Month; With Plenty of Chances for Every Member to Talk of His Pet Subject.] New York Times. December 17, 1911.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dinners==
Much of the activity of the Hobby Club was in the lavish dinners provided in the homes of the various members, who were then able to show off their hobbies and collections.
The Fourth Dinner of the Hobby Club was on September 27, 1912 in the home of [[Theodore N. Vail]] who gave a presentation on "The Intercommunication of Intelligence" at his country home, [[Speedwell Farms]], in [[Lyndonville, Vermont]]. "In the evening we had the club dinner, with Mr. Vail as speaker of the occasion. His subject, "The Intercommunication of Intelligence," enabled him to draw in a most interesting fashion upon his own reminiscences of the great work of establishing telegraphic and telephonic connection between all parts of the continent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101060744370 Annals of the Hobby Club of New York City, 1912-1920]. Hobby Club, New York. [New York] Priv. print. [The De Vinne press] 1920. Page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fifth Dinner was on October 31, 1912 in the home of Professor [[Bashford Dean]] and his presentation on "Ancient Armor" in [[Riverdale, New York]]. The Sixth Dinner was on December 19, 1912 was hosted by MR. [[John D. Crimins]] at the [[Metropolitan Club]] and his presentation was on "Early New York".

Through the courtesy of the [Joan of Arc] Statue Committee, the Club held a special meeting on the evening of Saturday, January 25, 1913, in the [[American Numismatic Society]] Building, to view the [[Joan of Arc]] Loan Exhibition. Dr. [[George F. Kunz]] presented to each member a special Hobby Club edition of the very artistic illustrated catalogue. The members later were entertained at the Hispano-American Museum, where their fellow member, Mr. [[Archer M. Huntington]], acted as host and guide, showing and explaining the many rare and beautiful art and literary treasures. The Seventh Dinner was held on January 30, 1913 by Mr. [[Alvin W. Krech]] who gave a talk on "[[Incunabula]]". The Eighth Dinner was held on March 20, 1913 and hosted by Mr. [[George A. Plimpton]] who gave a talk on "Education Before Printing as Endorsed by Original Manuscripts". The Ninth Dinner was held on May l, 1913, and hosted by Dr. George F. Kunz, who gave a talk on "Precious Stones" at the [[Union Club of the City of New York|Union Club]]. The Tenth Dinner was held on December 18, 1913 and hosted by Mr. [[R. T. Haines Halsey]] who spoke about "American Arts and Crafts of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries" at the [[Metropolitan Club]]. The Eleventh Dinner was held on February 19, 1914, and hosted by Mr. [[Winston H. Hagen]] who spoke about 'By-ways of Book Collecting'. The address was delivered by Mr. Halsey at his residence, No. 64 West 55th Street.

The Twelfth Dinner was held on March 26, 1914, and hosted by MR. [[David Wagstaff]] who spoke on "Books on Angling" at his home on No. 26 West 52nd Street.

[[Botswana]] is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] in persons, specifically forced labor and commercial [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]]. Parents in poor rural communities sometimes send their children to work for wealthier families as domestics in cities or as [[herder]]s at remote cattle posts, where some of these children are vulnerable to forced labor. Batswana girls are exploited in [[prostitution]] within the country, including in bars and by truck drivers along major highways; it does not appear, however, that organized pimping of children occurs. In the past, women reported being forced into commercial sexual exploitation at some [[safari lodge]]s, but there were no similar reports during this reporting period. Residents in Botswana most susceptible to trafficking are illegal immigrants from Zimbabwe, unemployed men and women, those living in [[rural poverty]], agricultural workers, and children orphaned by [[HIV/AIDS]]. Some women from Zimbabwe who voluntarily, but illegally, migrate to Botswana to seek employment are subsequently subjected by their employers to involuntary domestic servitude. Botswana families which employ Zimbabwean women as [[domestic worker]]s at times do so without proper work permits, do not pay adequate wages, and restrict or control the movement of their employees by holding their passports or threatening to have them deported back to Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Botswana". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of Botswana does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the reporting period, the government began drafting a comprehensive anti-trafficking law, investigated potential cases of human trafficking, and provided protective services to several individuals who may have been targets of traffickers. It failed, however, to prosecute and convict trafficking offenders or make attempts to proactively identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as irregular migrants subject to deportation.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The [[Politics of Botswana|Government of Botswana]] did not increase its efforts to prosecute or punish trafficking offenses over the last year, though it investigated several suspected cases of human trafficking. The government did not prosecute any trafficking offenses or convict or punish any trafficking offenders in 2009. Although it does not have a comprehensive law prohibiting trafficking in persons, provisions in the Penal Code of 1998, such as those in sections 155-158 on procurement for forced prostitution and sections 28000-262 on slavery, prohibit some forms of human trafficking. The sufficiently stringent penalties prescribed for offenses under these sections range from seven to 10 years’ imprisonment, and are commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. These sections have never been used to prosecute or convict a suspected trafficking offender. In June 2009, the [[National Assembly (Botswana)|Parliament]] passed a revised Children’s Act, which defined a child as anyone under the age of 18 and increased protections for children from various forms of exploitation, including child labor and child prostitution. Section 57 of the Act prohibits the facilitation or coercion of children into prostitution and prescribes sufficiently stringent penalties of two to five years’ imprisonment or a fine of $2858 to $7143. In October 2009, the Ministry of Defense, Justice and Security began drafting a comprehensive anti-trafficking law. Officers involved in law enforcement investigations of several non-trafficking crimes during 2009 observed that some of these crimes seemed to contain elements of human trafficking. Very few immigration and law enforcement officials are trained to effectively investigate cases of human trafficking or to differentiate between smuggling clients and trafficking victims, which continued to obscure the nature and extent of the trafficking situation in Botswana. In 2009, the Botswana Police Service conducted 10 in-service training courses for its officers, during which students received lectures on combating human trafficking. A police officer in the National Central Bureau of Interpol was assigned to work exclusively on human trafficking issues and to educate police officers about the phenomenon; information on his specific anti-trafficking duties and the results of his work were unavailable.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The government showed evidence of minimal efforts to protect victims of trafficking. During the year, the government did not identify or provide assistance to any confirmed victims of trafficking, but provided shelter and social services to three Zimbabwean children and six illegal Indian migrants who officials believed to be targets of transnational traffickers. The government provided logistical and financial assistance to repatriate all nine individuals to their countries of origin. NGO-operated shelters which received government funding to provide services to children, including children in prostitution, may have provided assistance to trafficked children without identifying them as such. Law enforcement and social services personnel have not established formal procedures to proactively identify victims of trafficking among vulnerable populations or to refer identified victims for protective services, and foreign trafficking victims have been deported from Botswana. During the reporting period, IO M identified 594 unaccompanied minors at the reception center in [[Plumtree, Zimbabwe|Plumtree]] for Zimbabweans deported from Botswana and expressed concern that some of them may have been victims of trafficking Botswana has an extensive public medical system, which includes psychological care facilities, and a university-run legal clinic which provides legal assistance to victims of any crime. It is unclear whether any trafficking victims received assistance at these facilities in 2009. Botswana's laws do not specifically protect victims of trafficking from penalization for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked, but the government did not generally prosecute persons it believed to be victims of any crime.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government made moderate efforts to prevent trafficking in and through Botswana. During the reporting period, the government did not complete or implement a national anti-trafficking plan of action it began developing in 2008. The government continued its participation with [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in an anti-trafficking working group. During the reporting period, the working group raised the issue of trafficking in the local press and within the government; fostered communication on trafficking issues between the government, NGOs, and other stakeholders; and laid the groundwork for drafting and implementing anti-TI P legislation. It produced and disseminated anti-trafficking education posters at all of its border posts and included trafficking awareness segments in some of its law enforcement training sessions. In early 2009, a partnership of NGOs and representatives from the government's police, labor, and social services responsible for issues of child labor, including the [[trafficking of children]] for forced labor, formed a child labor task force that met regularly throughout the reporting period. In mid-2009, the government funded the salaries of two ILO consultants to advise the government on how to strengthen both its laws on worst forms of child labor and enforcement of those laws. The task force began developing definitions for what constitutes "hazardous work" under child labor statutes and recommended changes within existing laws to standardize the definition of a "child" under different statutes. During the year, the Ministry of Labor conducted child labor inspections and removed at least one child from a situation of exploitative [[Child labour|child labor]]. The government made efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts, largely through a broad, well-publicized HIV /AIDS awareness campaign that discouraged commercial sex acts.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

[[File:I-report-for-CNN-shirt-Tinou-Bao.jpg|thumb|alt="i report for CNN" T-shirt.|A T-shirt sent to some iReport contributors]]

'''iReport''' is [[CNN]]'s [[citizen journalism]] initiative that allows people from around the globe to contribute pictures and video of breaking news stories. It is similar to [[Wikinews]] in that it allows, and encourages, ordinary citizens to submit stories, photos and videos related to news of any sort. This can range from breaking news to a story that a person believes is newsworthy. Submissions are not edited, fact-checked, or screened before they post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About CNN iReport|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/about.jspa|publisher=CNN|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories that are verified are approved for use on all of CNN's platforms. The program was launched on August 2, 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/08/01/ireport.first.year/index.html|title=I-Report turns one year old|accessdate=2008-05-12|publisher=[[CNN]] | date=2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; to take advantage of the newsgathering capabilities of citizens at the scene of notable events. iReport grew out of another related program: CNN's Fan Zone, which allowed viewers to contribute pictures and video from the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany.

The tsunami caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] gave citizen journalists at the scene the opportunity to report on the events as they experienced them. Pictures from both were difficult to obtain in the moments after each tragedy. Broadcast news outlets, depending on agency or bureau video, were fortunate to receive submissions from people on the scene. Developing this format became a necessity for cable and network news shows.

As of January 2012, there were more than a million registered iReport members. In January 2015 iReport was moved from direct access on the www.cnn.com website with a dramatic reduction in the number of views for stories. Many of the original senior staff members have moved or departed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zdanowicz|first=Christina|title=Meet the million: 999,999 iReporters + you!|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/blogs/ireport-blog/2012/01/23/meet-the-million-999999-ireporters-you|work=CNN iReport Blog|publisher=CNN|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of iReport has been utilized for specific programs, like the 2007 [[New Year's Eve]] coverage featuring '''iParty''' in which viewers' photos of their celebrations were shown on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I-Report for the New Year|url=http://edition.cnn.com/exchange/ireports/topics/forms/2006/12/iparty.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN producers also regularly provide "assignments", for possible inclusion in upcoming coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CNN iReport FAQ/Help|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/faq.jspa|publisher=CNN|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable events==
Although iReport proved popular from its inception, one event in particular catapulted such [[citizen journalism]] onto the international stage. On April 16, 2007, video submitted by graduate student Jamal Albarghouti captured the sounds of gunfire during the [[Virginia Tech shooting|Virginia Tech massacre]]. CNN paid Albarghouti an undisclosed amount for the exclusive rights to the video he shot on his mobile phone. The immediacy of the pictures demonstrated the potential for such content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/16/vtech.witness/index.html|title=Student shot video of campus shooting|accessdate=2008-05-12|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2007, many of the earliest pictures and eyewitness accounts of the [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge]] collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota were submitted to iReport.

{{anchor|Steve Jobs heart attack hoax}}In 2008, iReport generated controversy for a false report about [[Steve Jobs]]' health, which caused [[Apple Computers|Apple]]'s stock to temporarily drop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kafka|first=Peter|title=SEC Investigating Fraudulent Steve Jobs Heart Attack Report|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/2008/10/cnn-here-s-why-we-yanked-that-steve-jobs-heart-attack-story-aapl-|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blodget|first=Henry|title=Apple Denies Steve Jobs Heart Attack Report: "It Is Not True"|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/2008/10/apple-s-steve-jobs-rushed-to-er-after-heart-attack-says-cnn-citizen-journalist|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax was attributed to users of the web forum [[4chan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10058410-93.html|title = Who's to blame for spreading phony Jobs story?|work=[[CNET Networks|CNet News]]|first=Greg|last=Sandoval|date=October 4, 2008|accessdate=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/10/03/friday-apple-links-steve-jobs-still-not-dead |accessdate=January 11, 2009 |title=Friday Apple links: Steve Jobs still not dead edition |date=October 3, 2008 |first=Jacqui |last=Cheng |work=[[Ars Technica]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209025613/http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/10/03/friday-apple-links-steve-jobs-still-not-dead |archivedate=December 9, 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other instances where CNN iReport was being blown up with submissions are during Hurricane Sandy and the Boston Marathon Bombing. Although many citizen journalists have submitted articles to the site, many of them were not credible. This started much controversy for the webpage regarding ethical beliefs.

==CNN iReport Awards==

In 2011, CNN held the first iReport Awards, with awards being given for seven categories: breaking news, personal story, compelling imagery, commentary, original reporting, interview, and community choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ireport-awards|title=CNN iReport Awards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==iReport.com==
In January 2008 CNN acquired Ireport.com and I-report.com for $750,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/18/cnn-shells-out-750k-for-_n_82210.html|title=CNN Shells Out $750K For ireport.com Domain|accessdate=2008-05-12|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Danny|last=Shea|date=18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A beta version of the site launched on Wednesday, February 13, 2008. The site, which had its complete launch in March 2008, allows users to submit media and have it instantly appear on the site. CNN Producers will then go through the online submission and select reports for possible airing on the CNN television networks, CNN.com and other CNN platforms. The site also allows iReporters to contact each other. The site functions similar to YouTube and popular social.

==New York Times buzzword==
The [[New York Times]] described the word "I-reporter" as one of 2007's buzzwords: a word which endured long enough to find a place in the national conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/weekinreview/23buzzwords.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=All We Are Saying|accessdate=2008-05-12|publisher=[[New York Times]] | first=Grant | last=Barrett | date=2007-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shows==
[[CNN International]] aired "iReport for CNN". It was a weekly half-hour TV program showcasing iReport contributions. It was hosted by [[Errol Barnett]]. "[[News to Me]]" featured viewer-submitted content, along with other videos supplied by Blip.tv, Jumpcut.com, and Revver.com.

==Criticism==
iReport and other phenomenon billed as 'citizen journalism' by corporate news networks often offer no pay to contributors including photo and video contributions. While users are granted copyright to their contributions, they often are forced to relinquish control of who uses their work and where their images and video are shown worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ireport.com/terms.jspa|title=iReport Terms of Use Domain|accessdate=2010-01-02|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNN has also been criticized by insufficiently distinguishing iReport stories from its own output. There have been several cases where hoax stories placed on that service were given credence by their apparent connection to CNN, for example a story about an impending asteroid impact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/05/28/cnn_ireport_fake_story_about_a_killer_asteroid_impact_in_2041.html|title=No, an Asteroid Is Not Going to Wipe Out All Life on Earth in 2041|first=Phil|last=Plait|date=28 May 2014|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several stories regarding Apple Computer that significantly influenced its stock price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/10/cnn-citizen-jou/|title=‘Citizen Journalist’ Could Face Prison for Fake Jobs Story|first=Betsy|last=Schiffman|publisher=Wired.com|date=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inhalation''' is a major route of exposure that occurs when an individual breathes in polluted air which enters the respiratory tract.   Identification of the pollutant uptake by the respiratory system can determine how the resulting exposure contributes to the  [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]].  In this way, the mechanism of pollutant uptake by the respiratory system can be used to predict potential health impacts within the human population.

==Definition==
Exposure is commonly understood to be the concentration of the airborne pollutant in the air at the mouth and nose boundary. Outdoor concentrations are often measured at fixed sites or estimated with models. The fraction of this ambient concentration that is inhaled by a person depends mainly on their location (indoor or outdoor), distance to pollution sources and their [[minute ventilation]]. Traditionally exposure is estimated based on outdoor concentrations at the residential address. Trips to other locations and physical activity level are mostly neglected although some recent studies have attempted to use portable and wearable sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Intake dose is the mass of the pollutant that crosses the contact boundary and is inhaled by the individual.    Some of this pollutant is exhaled, and the fraction that is absorbed by the respiratory system is known as the [[absorbed dose]].  A portion of the pollutant may also be expelled by sneezing, coughing, spitting, or swallowing.  The remaining  pollutant that is transported through the liquid layer, making contact with the respiratory tract tissues is the fraction of [[bioavailability]], called the effective dose.

==Major pollutants of concern==

In 1970, the Clean Air Act Amendments set six criteria air pollutants which are updated periodically by the [[National Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) and the U.S [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA).  The six criteria pollutants were identified based on scientific knowledge of health effects caused by the pollutants.  The six criteria are the following:  [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] (PM), nitrogen oxide {{chem|NO|2}}, ozone {{chem|O|3}}, sulfur dioxide {{chem|SO|2}}, [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), and nonmethane hydrocarbons (NHMC).  Particulate matter (PM) is divided into two sizes, PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; which is called inhalable PM, and  PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, which is called fine PM.

==Uptake of gaseous pollutants==
[[Image:Respiratory system complete no labels.svg|thumb|right|250px]]

The diffusion of {{chem|O|2}} from the air in the lungs to the bloodstream, and diffusion of {{chem|CO|2}} from the bloodstream back out to the lungs is an essential part of human respiration.  The absorption and diffusion of gases is a bidirectional process.  Once the gases are absorbed into the mucus or surfactant layer, the dissolved gases can desorb back to the air in the lungs.  Gases may diffuse in either direction depending on the concentration gradient between the two layers.  Gases may react chemically during transport into the bloodstream.

Estimates of the resistance for gas mucus and tissue in the terminal bronchioles for  {{chem|SO|2}},  {{chem|O|2}}, and CO show that  {{chem|SO|2}} has the quickest uptake due to its high aqueous solubility and very low resistance of mucus and tissue layers.  Ozone and CO, have lower aqueous solubilities and higher resistance to mass transfer.  Ozone is the most reactive, reducing mass transfer into tissue and blood.  CO has the slowest uptake and the highest resistance into the terminal bronchioles.

==Uptake of particulate pollutants==
The deposition of particulate pollutants into the lungs is necessary before the particles can travel through the mucus into the lung tissue. There are four mechanisms of deposition:  interception, impaction, gravitational settling, and Brownian diffusion.  Interception happens when a particle is removed after brushing up against an obstacle. Impaction happens when the particle collides into the surface of the respiratory tract due to the high inertia.  Gravitational settling is influenced by the force of gravity which causes the particle to settle on the respiratory tract.  [[Brownian motion]] causes the random collision of gas molecules against the particle, until the particle goes into the respiratory tract.

Prediction of the location of particle deposition into the respiratory tract depends on the size and type of particle.  Coarse particles, originating from natural sources such as dust, sand and gravel, tend to deposit in the nasal-pharyngeal region. Fine particles, derived from anthropogenic sources such as fossil fuels and smoking, typically deposit in the pulmonary region.  Most gas exchange occurs in the pulmonary region due to the [[alveoli]], which contain a large surface area.

==Health impacts of particulate pollutants==

Scientists have identified a positive correlation between particulate matter concentrations being the causative factor of respiratory and cardiovascular disease.  Particulate matter may also be responsible for as many as 20,000 deaths annually, and exacerbation of asthma.  Quantification of dose, determining total number of particles deposited in the pulmonary region, surface area of particles, acidity of particles, and shape are important in determining health impacts.  A larger surface area will cause more toxins to be available for absorption into the mucus.  Particles such as [[asbestos]] have the ability to become permanently enlodged into the alveoli causing cancer in some cases.

Soluble particulate matter can be highly detrimental to the respirator tract because of their ability to dissolve into the mucus or surfactant layer.  This can irritate tissues by changing pH, and transport into the rest of the body or gastrointestinal tract.  Insoluble PM, such as lead particles, deposit in the nasal-pharyngeal region and can be cleared by blowing, sniffling, or spitting.  However, swallowing can cause the particles to deposit into th GI tract.  Particles in the tracheobronchial region can be cleared by the [[cilia]], which will move particles into the mucus.   Insoluble particles that enter the pulmonary region cause swelling  of the alveoli, coughing, and shortness of breath.

==Uptake of carbon monoxide==

Carbon monoxide is a relatively nonreactive gas with limited solubility.  High CO levels build up in the pulmonary region over several hours, and equilibrate with inhaled CO concentrations.  Exposure to carbon monoxide is dangerous because of its toxic, odorless nature.  Since the gas takes time to build up in the pulmonary region, an inhaled concentration of 600 ppm would cause a headache and reduce mental capacity within an hour, without any other symptoms.  Eventually, the substance would induce a coma.  Equilibrium of CO in the blood is reached between 6–8 hours of exposure to constant concentration in the air.

A baseline level of [[carboxyhemoglobin]], (COHb) is contained in the blood due to small quantities of CO as a by-product in the body.  The total amount of COHb present within the body is equivalent to the COHb baseline level in addition to the COHb exogenous level.

[COHb] total = [COHb] bas + [COHb] exo

'''Jerome Gilbert Miller''' (December 8, 1931 – August 7, 2015) was an American social worker, academic and public sector corrections administrator, who was an authority on the reform of juvenile and adult corrections systems.  He was a prominent advocate for [[alternatives to incarceration]] for offenders as well as for the [[de-institutionalization]] of individuals with developmental disabilities.  His career involved university teaching, administration of juvenile justice services for three states, clinical work with offenders and advocacy for systemic change in public sector correctional services.  Miller's work first drew national attention for his leadership in closing several juvenile reformatories in Massachusetts in the early 1970s.  Miller went on to emerge as a prominent national advocate, administrator and educator working for systemic change in public sector corrections and disability service delivery systems.  He was the co-founder of the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives.

==Early years==
Jerome Gilbert Miller was born on December 8, 1931 and grew up in [[Wahpeton, North Dakota]]. His parents were George Miller, a high school music teacher, and the former Beatrice Butts. He earned academic degrees from Maryknoll Seminary, Glen Ellyn, Il (B.A., 1954), [[Loyola University Chicago]] (M.S.W., 1957) and [[The Catholic University of America]] (D.S.W., 1965).  After his undergraduate studies, he spent a year in a [[Maryknoll]] [[novitiate]] in Bedford, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sparkaction.org/node/32515 JGM biographical notes] sparkaction. com, Retrieved 24 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Miller's doctoral studies concentrated in psychiatric social work, and he was qualified as a licensed clinical social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sparkaction.org/node/32516 |title=An Impatient Reformer is Admired and Reviled: Jerome G. Miller |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Miller was an Associate Professor in the School of Social Work at [[Ohio State University]], when in 1969 he was chosen by Massachusetts Governor [[Francis Sargent]] to serve as the Commissioner of the [[Massachusetts Department of Youth Services]] (DYS).

===Massachusetts experiment===
Within three years of leading DYS, Miller had shut down the state's two juvenile reformatories in favor of community based alternatives to incarceration.  The first closure involving [[Lyman School for Boys]] in 1971, caught many juvenile justice professionals in the state by surprise.  Lyman School was the first reformatory for delinquent adolescent boys to be established in the United States.  Anticipating the possible closure of the Massachusetts Industrial School for Boys at Shirley, various forces tried to mobilize against it, but Miller was successful in closing the school in 1972.  Highly controversial at the time, and still debated today, the basic deinstitutionalization reforms implemented by Miller in the state's juvenile justice services forty years ago are still in place today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prospect.org/article/reforming-juvenile-justice "Reforming Juvenile Justice”] August 14, 2005, ''The American Prospect'', Retrieved 24 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives to incarceration===
Recognized as a successful reformer capable of taking on entrenched state-level systems overly reliant on institutionalizing children and adolescents, Miller moved to Illinois in 1973 to serve as the Director of Children and Family Services and then to Pennsylvania in 1975 to serve as the Commissioner of Children and Youth.  From 1989 to 1994 Miller was the jail and prison monitor for Judge [[Howell W. Melton]] in the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida]].  From 1995 to 1997 Miller served as the court appointed receiver for Washington D.C.'s child welfare system. As a leader and reformer in these jurisdictions, he sought to address and overcome the traumatizing consequences of incarceration, to maximize the use of community resources as alternatives to imprisonment, to lower the disproportionate rates of locking up youth of color, to reduce recidivism by improving offender outcomes and to reduce unsustainable costs associated with escalating levels of incarceration.

===National Center for Institutions and Alternatives===
In 1977, together with [[Herbert J. Hoelter]], Miller co-founded the National Center for Institutions and Alternatives (NCIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yapinc.org/jerome-miller/ |title=Jerome Miller, Ph.D., Emeritus, Board of Directors |publisher=Youth Advocate Programs |accessdate=24 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120065542/http://www.yapinc.org/jerome-miller/ |archivedate=20 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About NCIA | publisher=NCIA| url = http://www.ncianet.org/about/ | accessdate = 2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus of NCIA involves sentencing advocacy, parole release advocacy and developing credible alternatives to incarceration and institutionalization.  Miller has written and lectured widely on juvenile and adult corrections and strategies for promoting and implementing systemic reforms that utilize community-based alternatives to replace counterproductive and financially unsustainable institutionalization of offenders and developmentally disabled patients.  Miller also served as the founder and clinical director of NCIA's Augustus Institute for Mental Health, named for [[John Augustus]], known as the 'father of probation' for his pioneering efforts to promote offender rehabilitation in the United States.

Miller died on August 7, 2015 in Woodstock, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/us/jerome-g-miller-who-reshaped-juvenile-justice-dies-at-83.html ''New York Times'' Jerome G Miller who reshaped juvenile justice dies at 83]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Jerome Miller's dramatic closure of two juvenile reformatories in Massachusetts in the early 1970s launched a forty year career as a pioneering administrator, educator and advocate for alternative models for responding to offenders and developmentally disabled persons.  Miller's capacity to articulate the need for reform, to envision models for systems transformation and ability to implement institutional change have been widely acknowledged, sometimes condemned and often praised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/26/books/let-his-children-go.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm "Let His Children Go" David C. Anderson "New York Times" January 26, 1992] Retrieved 24 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting on Miller's impact on juvenile justice reform efforts since the early 1970s, Dan Macallair, executive director of the Center for Juvenile and Criminal Justice, writes, ''The closing of the Massachusetts reforms schools stands as the premier event in the history of American juvenile justice reform ...Miller set the course for the 21st century juvenile justice system and secured his place among history's great reformers''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthtoday.org/view_blog.cfm?blog_id=558 The Closing of the Massachusetts Reform Schools and the Legacy of Jerome Miller] ''Youth Today'', December 2011, Retrieved 24 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joint POW-MIA Accounting Command seal.png|right]]

The '''Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command''' (often referred to as '''JPAC''') was a joint [[task force]] within the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) whose mission was to account for Americans who are listed as [[prisoner of war|Prisoners of War]] (POW), or [[Missing in Action]] (MIA), from all past wars and conflicts. It was especially visible in conjunction with the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]]. The mission of the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command was to achieve the fullest possible accounting of all Americans missing as a result of the nation's past conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpac.pacom.mil/eBrochure.htm |title=JPAC mission statement |publisher=Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020073833/http://www.jpac.pacom.mil/eBrochure.htm |archivedate=20 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto of JPAC was "Until they are home".

On 30 January 2015, JPAC was officially deactivated by the Department of Defense.  The Defense Department's efforts at reform followed a series of embarrassing scandals and damning revelations in reports and testimony before Congress starting in 2013 concerning failures in the effort to identify missing war dead. JPAC, the [[Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office]] (DPMO), and certain functions of the U.S. Air Force's Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory, were all merged into the new [[Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency]].

==Structure==
JPAC was a standing [[direct reporting unit]] within the [[United States Pacific Command]]. Its headquarters were located at [[Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam]] in Hawaii.

JPAC maintained three permanent overseas detachments, two local detachments, the Annex, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, and the European Liaison Office located on Miesau Army Depot, Germany; all devoted to the ongoing tasks of POW/MIA accounting. Each detachment was under the command of a field grade officer of the United States armed forces.

* Detachment 3 – [[Vientiane]], Laos
* Investigation and Recovery Group – [[Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam]], [[Oahu]], Hawaii; this group was the home base of the recovery teams when they were not deployed
* HQ – [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia.
* JPAC Annex - [[Offutt Air Force Base]], Nebraska; the JCA performed routine anthropological and odontological analysis in order to identify unaccounted-for service members. 
* European Liaison Office - [[Miesau Army Depot]], Germany; helped facilitate the planning, execution, logistical and administrative support for all JPAC operations in the European Command area of responsibility.
* The laboratory portion of JPAC referred to as the Central Identification Laboratory (CIL).

==History==
*1973: The DOD established the Central Identification Laboratory–Thailand to coordinate POW/MIA recovery efforts in Southeast Asia.
*1976: The DOD established the Central Identification Laboratory–Hawaii to search for, recover, and identify missing Americans from all previous conflicts.
*1992: The Joint Task Force–Full Accounting (JTF-FA) was established to focus on achieving the fullest possible accounting of American missing from the Vietnam War.
*2002: DOD determined that POW/MIA recovery efforts would be best served by combining the two Central Identification Laboratories and the Joint Task Force.
*1 October 2003: The Joint POW/MIA Accounting command was established under the auspices of the Commander, Pacific Command (CDRUSPACOM).

==Operations==
JPAC's operations were divided into four areas: Analysis and Investigation, Recovery, Identification, and Closure.

===Analysis and investigation===
JPAC investigated leads concerning Americans who were killed in action but were never brought home. This process involved close coordination with other U.S. agencies involved in the POW/MIA issue. JPAC carried out technical negotiations and talks with representatives of foreign governments around the world in order to ensure positive in-country conditions were maintained or created for JPAC investigative and recovery operations wherever JPAC teams deployed in the world. If enough evidence was found, a site was recommended for recovery.

===Recovery===

[[File:LaosRecovery01b.jpg|thumb|right|Laotians hired to assist U.S. troops sift then move tons of dirt on a mountain near Xepon, [[Laos]] (July 2004). This particular mission involved searching for the human remains of two [[F-4 Phantom]] crewmen who crashed after a bombing run over Vietnam.]]
JPAC had 18 Recovery Teams whose members traveled throughout the world to recover missing from past wars. A typical recovery team was made up of 10 to 14 people, led by a team leader and a [[Forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologist]]. Other members of the team typically included a team sergeant, linguist, medic, life support technician, forensic photographer, RF systems communications technician/operator and an [[Bomb disposal|explosive ordnance disposal]] technician. Additional experts were added to the mission as needed, such as mountaineering specialists or divers.

The team carefully excavates the site and screens the soil to locate all possible remains and artifacts. In the case of an airplane crash, a recovery site may be quite large.

Once the recovery effort was completed, the team returned to Hawaii. All remains and artifacts found during the recovery operation were then transported from a U.S. military plane or private airline to JPAC's Central Identification Laboratory where identification took an average of 18 months; often cited statistics of 11 years include materials that were severely commingled (intentionally) from turnovers from the Korean People's Army in the mid-1990s.  These materials only recently began to be identified used several different DNA techniques.

===Identification===
Upon arrival at the laboratory, all remains and artifacts recovered from a site were signed over to the custody of the CIL and stored in a secure area. 
Forensic anthropologists carefully analyze all remains and artifacts to determine the sex, race, age at death, and stature of the individual. Anthropologists also analyzed trauma caused at or near the time of death and pathological conditions of bone such as arthritis or previous healed breaks. 
Lab scientists used a variety of techniques to establish the identification of missing Americans, including analysis of skeletal and dental remains, sampling [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA), and analyzing material evidence, personal effects, aviation life-support equipment (gear used by aircrew: helmets, oxygen masks, harnesses, etc.), or other military equipment.

Often, recovered military and personal equipment artifacts were forwarded to the USAF Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory (LSEL, located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Dayton, OH), for advanced scientific and historical analysis. The LSEL (a highly unique scientific facility within the US and the world) was singularly qualified to scientifically study recovered military equipment artifacts and determine critical forensic aspects, to include, but not limited to: number of unaccounted for personnel represented at the loss site (i.e. 2 aviators), branch of military service represented (i.e. Navy), vehicle type represented (i.e. F-4 aircraft type), time frame represented (i.e. c. 1967), and represented levels of non-survivability or survivability (i.e. any evidence of fatal/non-fatal status).
Frequently, the LSEL was able to provide crucial case determinations (through analysis of recovered equipment artifacts) when other critical evidence (such as human remains: bone or teeth) was not recovered or available, and/or does not yield any substantial conclusions through testing (i.e. DNA testing).

===Closure===
The recovery and identification process may take years to complete. The average identification time by the JPAC CIL was 18 months, excluding a vast amount of commingled remains turned over by North Korea, after remains arrived in the laboratory.  In addition to the factors previously mentioned, each separate line of evidence was examined at the CIL (bones, teeth, and material evidence) and correlated with all historical evidence. All reports underwent a thorough peer review process that included an external review by independent experts. Additionally, if mtDNA was part of the process, the search for family reference samples for mtDNA comparison added a significant amount of time to the identification process because building a DNA database was not the purview of JPAC. Completed cases were forwarded to the appropriate service [[Mortuary Affairs]] office, whose members personally notified next-of-kin family members.

==Ongoing efforts==
[[File:Rear Admiral Donna Crisp and President Kalkot Mataskelekele.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Navy Rear Adm. Donna Crisp, commander, Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, talks with [[Vanuatu]] President [[Kalkot Mataskelekele]] at a repatriation ceremony in 2009.]]
JPAC conducted a number of missions each year in its ongoing efforts. The missions per year for individuals missing for each war:
*[[Korean War]]: 5 missions
*[[Vietnam War]] (including Southeast Asia): 10 missions
*[[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]]: 10 missions

In 2007 a JPAC team led by Maj. Sean Stinchon visited [[Iwo Jima|Iō-tō (formerly Iwo Jima)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Associated Press |title = 'Until They are Home:' Iwo Jima search latest in U.S. effort to account for all MIAs|url= http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/03/asia/AS-FEA-GEN-Japan-Iwo-Jima-Still-Missing.php?page=1| accessdate =9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hunt for the remains of Marine Sergeant [[William Genaust|Bill Genaust]]. He was the Marine combat photographer (motion picture cameraman) who was standing next to [[Joe Rosenthal]], who filmed the [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]] during the World War II invasion of the island. The team identified two possible cave entrances that may contain Genaust's remains. The JPAC team hopes to return and properly search the tunnels to possibly locate the remains of Sergeant Genaust, and those of other unaccounted for Marines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lucas, Dean|title = Famous Pictures Magazine – Iwo Jima|url= http://www.famouspictures.org/raising-the-flag-on-iwo-jima/| accessdate =9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 evaluation, reports, and investigations into JPAC==
An internal JPAC report, obtained by the [[Associated Press]] in July 2013, cited JPAC's management as being inept, mismanaged, and wasteful, to the extent that it could worsen from "dysfunction to total failure". In the Associated Press story's words, the report says "the decades-old pursuit of bones and other MIA evidence is sluggish, often duplicative and subjected to too little scientific rigor". The report notes that the JPAC Command is "woefully inept and even corrupt". The report notes that in recent years the process by which the JPAC Laboratory field recovery teams gathers bones and other material useful for identifications has "collapsed" and is now "acutely dysfunctional." The report concludes that absent prompt and significant change, "the descent from dysfunction to total failure … is inevitable." It accused the Command of maintaining inadequate databases of missing personnel, relying on unreliable maps, wasting money on unnecessary and useless travel and drastically failing to achieve targets set by the U.S. Congress. It said the organization paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to North Korea to "recover" the remains of fallen U.S. servicemen whose bodies had been planted on former battlefields, and even used as laboratory skeletons.  In the report it was stated that the average length of time for the JPAC laboratory to identify casualties increased from slightly over 4 years in 2005 to 11 years in 2011 for each set of remains that are recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency= [[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title = Internal report calls MIA accounting work 'acutely dysfunctional,' could fail|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ap-impact-internal-report-calls-mia-accounting-work-acutely-dysfunctional-could-fail/2013/07/07/7a09bee6-e6f7-11e2-818e-aa29e855f3ab_story.html| date=7 July 2013|accessdate =8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contrary viewpoint, expressed by author [[Wil S. Hylton]], holds that while the command has suffered from bureaucratic tendencies, "it is flat-out wrong to dismiss the work of JPAC as a failure. For every instance in which the unit moves more slowly than it could, there are many cases where JPAC field teams have delivered answers to a family that would otherwise be lost forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/opinion/missing-in-action-but-not-forever.html | title=Op-Ed: Missing in Action, but Not Forever | author=[[Wil S. Hylton]] | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=11 July 2013 | page=A21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NBC News]] also revealed during 2013 that, for years, the U.S. government has been fabricating phony "arrival ceremonies" during which the honored dead soldiers from the former battlefields were seemingly transported to their homeland by a [[cargo plane]], but were actually not in existence at all. In addition, being towed into adequate positions, the planes used in the ceremonies often could not fly. This was confirmed by both the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the JPAC team with the explanations that "part of the ceremony involves symbolically transferring the recovered remains from an aircraft" and "static aircraft are used for the ceremonies".&lt;ref name="nbc-phony"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stripes.com/jpac-admits-to-phony-ceremonies-honoring-returning-remains-1.246322 | publisher = Stars and Stripes | title = JPAC admits to phony ceremonies honoring 'returning' remains | date=  10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple government investigations into JPAC were initiated in 2013, including ongoing Congressional hearings in both the House and Senate.&lt;ref name="nbc-phony"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/10/20889368-pentagon-unit-held-phony-ceremonies-for-mias-using-planes-that-cant-fly | publisher = NBC News | title =  PENTAGON UNIT HELD "PHONY" CEREMONIES FOR MIA'S, USING PLANES THAT CAN'T FLY   | date=  10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-takes-second-look-embattled-mia-unit-181006356.html | publisher = Associated Press | title = PENTAGON TAKES "SECOND LOOK" AT EMBATTLED MIA UNIT | date=  9 July 2013}}

The POW/MIA effort by JPAC and a handful of agencies around the country, was fragmented, overlapped and hampered by inter-agency disputes, a July 2013 Government Accountability Office report said. In February 2014, Secretary of Defense [[Chuck Hagel]] directed the merging of JPAC and the [[Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office]] (DPMO), as well as certain functions of the U.S. Air Force's Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory, into a single, more accountable agency.  In October 2014, a report by the DoD inspector general said poor leadership and a [[hostile work environment]] at JPAC could continue to plague the mission.   The last commander of JPAC, Major General Kelly McKeague, was demoted to deputy commander and replaced by Rear Admiral Mike Franken.  The JPAC Scientific Director, Thomas Holland, was replaced by Captain Edward Reedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stripes.com/news/new-combined-pow-mia-agency-becomes-operational-1.327190| publisher = Stars and Stripes | title = New Combined POW/MIA Agency Becomes Operational | date=  2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20150130_Hawaiis_JPAC_folds_into_Defense_POWMIA_Accounting_Agency.html?id=290397121| publisher = Honolulu Star Advertiser | title = Hawaii's JPAC Folds | date=  31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2015, the merger into the new [[Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency]] became official, and JPAC ceased to be.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1903">'''Judicial Conduct Investigations Office''' (JCIO) is an independent statutory office in the [[England]] whose remit is to investigation allegations of [[Judicial misconduct]]. Their offices are located in the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], [[London]]. Their role is to support the [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Lord Chief Justice]] who share responsibility for judicial discipline in [[England and Wales]]. It was established on 1 October 2013 when it replaced the [[Office for Judicial Complaints]]. The equivalent in [[Scotland]] is the [[Judicial Complaints Reviewer]]. The body was created under the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].&lt;ref name="Rozenberg"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rozenberg |first1=Joshua |title=Who is judging the judges? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/mar/25/who-judges-the-judges |accessdate=18 October 2018 |work=the Guardian |issue=25 March 2014 |date=2014 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JCIO publishes "Disciplinary statements" when they issue a disciplinary sanction to a judicial office holder upon finding of misconduct. Such statements are deleted  after one year for sanctions below removal from office, after five years when the sanction is removal from office. However the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice may, at their discretion, decline to publish a disciplinary statement.&lt;ref name="JCIO DS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Publication policy - Judicial Conduct Investigations Office |url=https://judicialconduct.judiciary.gov.uk/disciplinary-statements/publication-policy/ |website=Judicial Conduct Investigations Office |publisher=Judicial Conduct Investigations Office |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaddakkal Riot is one of the 39 movements/struggles that led to India getting freedom from the [[British Raj]]. It is known as the '''"Kadakkal Riot Case"''' and is recognized by the Home Ministry of Government of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=List of Movements|first=Freedom Struggle|title=List of Freedom Movements|url=http://pensionersportal.gov.in/Briefsssp.asp|publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, GOI|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The struggle was led by Franco Raghavan Pillai. Kadakkal Riot Case was an important part of the [[Indian independence movement]] from [[Kerala]].

Kadakkal Riot was centred on the village of [[Kadakkal]], which is located in the eastern part of Kollam district, Kerala. It happened same as that of  [[Kallara-Pangode Struggle]](1938) on September 29, 1939.

Kadakkal is located 5&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Nilamel]] on [[Thiruvananthapuram]] – [[Angamaly]] Main Centre Road ([[MC Road]]). [[Kadakkal]] has been an important business centre for [[spice]] production and trade for a long time.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2015}}

A '''lady-in-waiting''' or '''court lady''' is a female [[personal assistant]] at a court, [[royal court|royal]] or [[feudalism|feudal]], attending on a royal woman or a high-ranking [[nobility|noblewoman]]. Historically, in Europe, a lady-in-waiting was often a noblewoman, but of lower rank than of the woman on whom she attended. Although she may either have been a [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] or may not have received compensation for the service she rendered, a lady-in-waiting was considered more of a [[courtesan]] or [[lady's companion|companion]] to her [[mistress (form of address)|mistress]] than a [[domestic worker|servant]].

In other parts of the world outside Europe, the lady-in-waiting, often referred to as ''palace woman'', was often in practice a servant or a slave rather than a high-ranking woman, but still had about the same tasks, functioning as companion and secretary to her mistress. In courts where polygamy was practiced, a court lady was formally available to the monarch for sexual services, and she could become his wife or concubine.

''Lady-in-waiting'' or ''court lady'' is often a generic term for women whose relative rank, title, and official functions varied, although such distinctions were also often honorary. A royal woman may or may not be free to select her ladies, and, even when she has such freedom, her choices are usually heavily influenced by the sovereign, her parents, her husband, or the sovereign's ministers (for example, in the [[Bedchamber Crisis]]).

==History==
The development of the office of lady-in-waiting in Europe is connected to that of the development of a royal court. During the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the 9th century, [[Hincmar]] describes the royal household of [[Charles the Bald]] in the ''De Ordine Palatii'' from 882, in which he states that court officials took orders from the queen as well as the king. Already [[Merovingian]] queens are assumed to have had their personal servants, and in the 9th century it is confirmed that Carolingian queens had an entourage of guards from the [[nobility]] as a sign of their dignity, and some officials are stated to belong to the queen rather than the king.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}}

In the late 12th century, the queens of France are confirmed to have had their own household, and noblewomen are mentioned as ladies-in-waiting.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}} During the Middle Ages, however, the household of a European queen consort was normally small and the number of actually employed ladies-in-waiting, rather than wives of noblemen accompanying their husbands to court, was very small: in 1286, the queen of France had only five ladies-in-waiting in her employ, and it was not until 1316 that her household was separated from that of the royal children.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}}

The role of ladies-in-waiting in Europe changed dramatically during the age of the [[Renaissance]], when a new ceremonial court life, where women played a significant part, developed as representation of power in the courts of [[Italy]] and spread to [[Burgundy]], from Burgundy to France, and to the rest of the courts of Europe.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}} The court of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] was the most elaborate in Europe in the 15th century and became an example to France when the French royal court expanded in the late 15th century and introduced new offices for both men and women to be able to answer to the new renaissance ideal.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}} From small circle of married ''femmes'' and unmarried ''filles'', with a relatively humble place in the background during the Middle Ages, the number of French ladies-in-waiting were rapidly expanded, divided into an advanced hierarchy with several offices and given an important and public role to play in the new ceremonial court life in early 16th-century France.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}} This example was followed by other courts in Europe, where courts expanded and became more ceremonial during the 16th century, and the offices, numbers and visibility of women expanded in the early modern age.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}}

During the late 19th century and the early 20th century, however, most European courts started to reduce their court staff, often due to new economic and political circumstances which made court representation more questionable.

The duties of ladies-in-waiting varied from court to court, but functions historically discharged by ladies-in-waiting included proficiency in the [[etiquette]], languages, and dances prevalent at court; [[secretary|secretarial]] tasks; reading correspondence to her mistress and writing on her behalf; [[embroidery]], painting, horse riding, music making and participation in other queenly pastimes; [[wardrobe]] care; supervision of servants; keeping her mistress abreast of activities and personages at court, and discreetly relaying messages upon command.

==By court==

===Africa===
A number of tribes and cultural areas in the African continent, such as the [[Lobedu people]] of Southern Africa, had a similar custom on ladies-in-waiting in historic times.

Within certain [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of the [[Bini people|Bini]] and [[Yoruba people]]s in Nigeria, the [[queen mother]]s and [[high priestess]]es were considered "ritually male" due to their social eminence. Due to this fact, they were often attended on by women who belonged to their [[harem]]s in much the same way as their actually male counterparts were served by women who belonged to theirs. Although these women effectively functioned as ladies-in-waiting, were often members of powerful families of the local nobility in their own right, and were not usually used for sexual purposes, they were none-the-less referred to as their principals' ''wives''.

===Austria===
In the late Middle Ages, when the court of the emperor no longer moved around constantly, the household of the empress, as well as the equivalent household of the German princely consorts, started to develop a less fluid and more strict organisation with set court offices.

The court model of the Duchy of Burgundy, as well as the Spanish court model, came to influence the organisation of the Austrian imperial court during the 16th-century, when the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], Spain and Austria was united through the [[Habsburg dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Duindam date? page?"&gt;{{harvnb|Duindam|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=April 2017}} In the early and mid 16th-century, the female courtiers kept by female Habsburgs in the Netherlands and Austria was composed of one ''hofmesterees'' ('Court mistress') or ''dame d'honneur'' who served as the principal lady in waiting; one ''hofdame'' or ''Mere de filles'', who was second in rank and deputy of the ''hofmesterees'' as well as being in charge of the ''eredames'' (maid of honour), also known as ''demoiselle d'honneur'', ''fille d'honneur'' or ''Junckfrauen'' depending on language, and finally the chamber maids, ''kamenisters''.&lt;ref name="Kerkhoff date? page?"&gt;{{harvnb|Kerkhoff|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=April 2017}} During the tenure of [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress]] in the mid 16th-century, however, the court of the empress was organised in accordance with the Spanish court model, and after she left Austria, there was no further household of an empress until the 1610s.&lt;ref name="Akkerman 2013"&gt;{{harvnb|Akkerman|2013||p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=April 2017}} This resulted in a mix of Burgundian and Spanish customs when the Austrian court model was created.

In 1619, a set organisation was finally established for the Austrian Imperial court which came to be the characteristic organisation of the Austrian-Habsburg court roughly kept from this point onward.&lt;ref name="Akkerman 2013"/&gt; The first rank of the female courtiers was the ''[[Obersthofmeisterin]]'' ([[Mistress of the Robes]]), who was second in rank after the empress herself, and responsible for all the female courtiers.&lt;ref name="Akkerman 2013"/&gt; Second rank belonged to the ''ayas'', essentially governesses of the imperial children and heads of the children's court.&lt;ref name="Akkerman 2013"/&gt; Third in rank was the ''Fräuleinhofmeisterin'': she was the replacement of the Obersthofmeisterin when necessary, but otherwise had the responsibility of the unmarried female courtiers, their conduct and service.&lt;ref name="Akkerman 2013"/&gt;  The rest of the female noble courtiers consisted of the ''Hoffräulein'' ([[maid of honour]]), unmarried females from the nobility who normally served temporarily until marriage.&lt;ref name="Akkerman 2013"/&gt; The Hoffräulein could sometimes be promoted to ''[[Kammerfräulein]]'' (Maid of honor of the Chamber).&lt;ref name="Akkerman 2013"/&gt; The Austrian court model was the role model for the princely courts in Germany.&lt;ref name="Akkerman 2013"/&gt; The German court model in turn became the role model of the early modern Scandinavian courts of Denmark and Sweden.&lt;ref name="Persson 1999"&gt;{{harvnb|Persson|1999|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

===Belgium===
The Kingdom of Belgium was founded in 1830, after which a royal court was founded, and ladies-in-waiting were appointed for [[Louise of Orléans]] when she became the first queen of Belgium in 1832. The female office holders of the queen's household was created from the French model and composed of one ''[[dame d'honneur]]'', followed by several ladies-in-waiting named ''dame du palais'', in turn over ranking the ''[[premiere femme du chambre]]'' and the ''femme du chambre''.&lt;ref&gt;''Almanach royal officiel de Belgique'', Pour L'an 1841 {{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ladies-in waiting have historically been chosen by the Queen herself from among the Catholic [[Belgian nobility|noble houses of Belgium]]. The chief functions at court were undertaken by members of the higher nobility, involving much contact with the royal ladies. Belgian princesses were assigned a lady upon their 18th birthday. Princess Clementine was given a ''Dame'' by her father, a symbolic act of adulthood. When the Queen entertains, the ladies welcome guests and assist the hostess in sustaining conversation.

===Britain===
In the current [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]] of the United Kingdom, a Lady-in-Waiting is a woman attending a female member of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]]. A woman attending on a [[Queen Regnant]] or [[Queen Consort]] is often (informally) known by the same title, but is more formally styled either: ''[[Woman of the Bedchamber]]'', ''[[Lady of the Bedchamber]]'' or ''[[Mistress of the Robes]]'', depending on which of these offices she holds. The Women are in regular attendance, but the Mistress of the Robes and the Ladies of the Bedchamber are normally required only for ceremonial occasions. The phrase ''Lady-in-Waiting to The Queen'' has, however, been used in formal documents to denote which of the Women is actually "on duty"'' at any one time.''&lt;ref&gt;"Lady Dugdale has succeeded the Hon Mary Morrison as Lady-in-Waiting to The Queen" ([[Court Circular]], 1 June 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, the Senior Lady-in-Waiting to [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is [[Mistress of the Robes]], [[Fortune FitzRoy, Duchess of Grafton]]. The other Ladies-in-Waiting are [[Virginia Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie]]; [[Barry Maxwell, 12th Baron Farnham|Diana, Lady Farnham]]; The Hon [[Mary Anne Morrison]]; [[Lady Susan Hussey|The Lady Susan Hussey]]; [[Rodney Elton, 2nd Baron Elton|The Lady Elton]]; The Hon Mrs Whitehead, (daughter of [[Frederick Millar, 1st Baron Inchyra]]); [[Alexander Gordon-Lennox (Royal Navy officer)|Jennifer Gibbs (Mrs Michael Gordon Lennox)]] and Philippa de Pass, wife of Lieutenant Commander Robert de Pass.{{sfn|''British Monarchy''|2016}}

===Cambodia===
In Cambodia, the term "ladies-in-waiting" refers to high ranking female servants who served food and drink, fanned and massaged, and sometimes provided sexual services to the King. Conventionally, these women could work their way up from [[maid]]s to ladies-in-waiting, [[concubine]]s, or even [[queen consort]]. ''Srey Snom'' ({{lang-km|ស្រីស្នំ}}) is the Cambodian term for the Khmer "lady-in-waiting".

The six favorite court ladies of King [[Sisowath]] of Cambodia were probably initially drawn from the ranks of classical royal dancers of the lower class. He was noted for having the most classical dancers as concubines. The imperial celestial dancer, [[Apsara]], was one of these. This practice of drawing from the ranks of royal dancers began in the Golden Age of the Khmer Kingdom. 

===China===
[[File:A palace concert.jpg|thumb|Chinese Tang dynasty court ladies on ''[[A Palace Concert]]'' painting]]

The ladies-in-waiting in China, referred to as ''palace women'', ''palace ladies'' or ''court ladies'', were all formally if not always in practice a part of the emperors harem, regardless of their task, and could be promoted by him to the rank of official concubine, consort or even empress.&lt;ref name="Ebrey date? page?"&gt;{{harvnb|Ebrey|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}} Already the emperors of the [[Han dynasty]] in antiquity is reported to have had a harem of thousands of ''palace women'', although the actual numbers is unconfirmed.&lt;ref name="Ebrey date? page?"/&gt;

At least during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), the palace women were divided in three groups: Imperial women, consisting of concubines and consorts; Imperial daughters, consisting of daughters and sisters of the emperor; and the female officials and assistants, who performed a wide range of tasks and could potentially be promoted to that of concubine or consort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chung|pp=960–1126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women from official elite families could be chosen to become empress, consort or concubine immediately upon their entrance to the palace, but the emperor could also promote any female court official to that post, as they were officially all members of his harem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chung|pp=960–1126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female court officials and attendants were normally selected from trusted families and educated for their task, which could be a wide range from female attendant to an Imperial woman, musician, chamber maid or official with the task to organize court functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chung|pp=960–1126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system was roughly the same during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912), when there were also a class of Imperial women selected immediately as consorts or concubines, but the class of female court attendants were all available to be promoted to concubines and consorts by the emperor.&lt;ref name="Walthall date?, page?"&gt;{{harvnb|Walthall|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}} During the Qing dynasty Imperial women were selected from among the teenage daughters of the Manchu official banner families, who were drafted to an inspection as imperial consorts or concubines before they could marry.&lt;ref name="Walthall date?, page?"/&gt; Similarly, ''palace maids'' were drafted from lower official and banner classes before they could marry.&lt;ref name="Hsieh Bao Hua date?, page?"&gt;{{harvnb|Hsieh Bao Hua|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}} After their selection, palace maids were educated as personal attendants to consorts, female officials within court rituals or other tasks, and were also available for the emperor to promote to consort or concubine.&lt;ref name="Hsieh Bao Hua date?, page?"/&gt;  Below the palace maids were the maidservants, who were selected the same way by a draft among the daughters of soldiers.&lt;ref name="Hsieh Bao Hua date?, page?"/&gt;

===Denmark===
The early modern Danish court was organized according to the German court model, in turn inspired by the Imperial Austrian court model, from the 16th century onward.&lt;ref name="Persson 1999"/&gt; The highest rank female courtier to a female royal was the ''[[hofmesterinde]]'' (Court Mistress) or, from 1694/98 onward, ''[[Overhofmesterinde]]'' (Chief Court Mistres), equivalent to the Mistress of the Robes, normally an elder widow, who supervised the rest of the ladies-in-waiting.&lt;ref name="Kjølsen 2010, page?"&gt;{{harvnb|Kjølsen|2010|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}} The rest of the female courtiers were composed of one ''[[Kammerfrøken]]'' (Senior Maid of Honour), followed by a group of ''hofdame'' ('court lady') with the title of ''Hoffrøken'' ([[maid of honour]]).&lt;ref name="Kjølsen 2010, page?"/&gt; They were followed by the non noble female court employees not ranking as ladies-in-waiting, such as the chamber maids. 

This hierarchy was roughly in place from the 16th century until the death of king [[Christian IX of Denmark]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="Kjølsen 2010, page?" /&gt; During the 20th century most of these titles came of use and all ladies-in-waiting at the royal Danish court are now referred to as ''hofdame'' ('court lady').

===England===
In the Middle Ages, [[Margaret of France, Queen of England]] is noted to have had seven ladies-in-waiting: the three married ones were called ''Domina'' and the four unmarried [[maid of honour]], but no principal lady-in-waiting is mentioned,&lt;ref&gt;William J. Thoms: The Book of the Court: Exhibiting the History, Duties, and Privileges of the English Nobility and Gentry. Particularly of the Great Officers of State and Members of the Royal Household, 1844&lt;/ref&gt; and until the 15th-century, the majority of the office holders of the queen's household were still male.&lt;ref name="erenow.com"&gt;Alison Weir: ''[http://erenow.com/biographies/elizabethofyork/15.html  Elizabeth of York: A Tudor Queen and Her World]''&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as in the mid 15th-century, queen [[Elizabeth Woodville]] had still only five ladies-in-waiting,&lt;ref name="erenow.com"/&gt; but in the late 15th-century and early 16th-century, ladies-in-waiting were given a more dominant place at the English court, in parallel with the development in France and the continental courts. The court life of the Duchy of Burgundy served as an example when Edward IV created the ''Black Book of the Household'' in 1478,&lt;ref name="Duindam date? page?"/&gt; and the organisation of the English royal household was essentially set from that point onward.{{sfn|Gosman|Macdonald|Vanderjagt|p=}}{{page needed |date=April 2017}}

Queen [[Elizabeth of York]] had numerous ladies-in-waiting, which was reported by the Spanish ambassador Rodrigo de Puebla as something unusual and astonishing: "the Queen has thirty-two ladies, very magnificent and in splendid style".&lt;ref name="erenow.com"/&gt; Elizabeth of York reportedly had 36 ladies-in-waiting, eighteen of them noblewomen; in 1502, a more complete account summarized them as sixteen "gentlewomen", seven maids of honor and three "chamberers—women", who attended to her in the bedchamber.&lt;ref name="erenow.com"/&gt;  Aside from the women formally employed as ladies-in-waiting, the queen's female retinue in reality also consisted of
the daughters and the ladies-in-waiting of her ladies-in-waiting, who also resided in the queen's household.&lt;ref name="erenow.com"/&gt;

The duties of ladies-in-waiting at the [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] court were to act as companions in public and in private; to accompany her wherever she went; to entertain her with music, dance or singing; and to dress her, bathe her and help her use the lavatory, as a royal person, by the standards of the day, was not supposed to do anything by themselves, but was always to be waited upon in all daily tasks as a sign of their status.&lt;ref name="erenow.com"/&gt;  Ladies-in-waiting were appointed by recommendation of their social status as members of the nobility, court officials, knights and military officers; and because they were expected to be supporters of the dynasty or the royal woman because of their relatives.  When the queen was not a foreigner, her relatives were often appointed as they were presumed to be trustworthy and loyal; [[Margaret Lee (lady-in-waiting)|Lady Margaret Lee]] was a Lady of the Privy Chamber to Queen [[Anne Boleyn]], just as [[Elizabeth Seymour, Marchioness of Winchester|Lady Elizabeth Seymour-Cromwell]] was to Queen [[Jane Seymour]]. 

The organization of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting was set in the period of the Tudor court. The ladies-in-waiting were headed by the [[Mistress of the Robes]], followed in rank by the [[First Lady of the Bedchamber]], who supervised the group of [[Lady of the Bedchamber]] (typically wives or widows of peers above the rank of earl), in turn followed by the group of [[Woman of the Bedchamber]] (usually a daughter of a peer) and finally the group of [[Maid of honour]], whose service entitled them to the [[style (manner of address)|style]] of ''[[Honourable|The Honourable]]'' for life.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=664}} 
The system has formally remained roughly the same since the Tudor period. However, in practice, many offices have since then been left vacant. For example, in recent times, Maids of Honour have only been appointed for [[coronation]]s.

===France===
[[File:Madame la princesse de Lamballe by Antoine-François Callet (circa 1776, Callet).jpg|thumb|[[Princess Marie Louise of Savoy|Marie Louise of Savoy-Carignan, Princesse de Lamballe]] was lady-in-waiting to Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] of France]]

The queen of France is confirmed to have had a separate household in the late 12th-century, and an ordinance from 1286 notes that the queen of France, queen [[Joan I of Navarre]], had a group of five ladies (''Dames'') and maids-in-waiting (''Damoiselles''): in the 1480s, French ladies-in-waiting were divided into ''Femmes mariées'' (married ladies-in-waiting) and ''Filles d’honneur'' (maid of honour).{{sfn|Kolk|2009}} However, the queen's household and the number of female courtiers during the Middle Ages was very small in France, as in most European courts: it was not until the end of the 15th-century and early 16th-century that emulation of the new courts of the Italian [[Renaissance]] made ladies-in-waiting fashionable in official court ceremonies and representation, and female court offices became more developed and numerous in the French court as well as in other European courts.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}} The introduction of ladies-in-waiting increased in great numbers at the French court at this time: from a mere five in 1286 and still only 23 in 1490, to 39 in 1498 and circa 54 during the 16th-century.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}} This expansion of female presence at court has been attributed to both [[Anne of Brittany]], who encouraged all male courtiers to send their daughters to her, and to [[Francis I of France]], who was criticized for bringing to court "the constant presence" of large crowds of women, who gossiped and interfered in state affairs; Francis I once said: ‘a court without ladies is a court without a court’.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}}

*The first ranked female courtier in the French royal court was the ''[[Surintendante de la Maison de la Reine]]'' (Mistress of the Robes) to the Queen. The Surintendante and the ''[[Governess of the Children of France]]'' were the only female office holders in France to give an oath of loyalty to the King himself.&lt;ref name="Duindam date? page?"/&gt; This office was created in 1619,&lt;ref name="Akkerman Houben date?, page?"&gt;{{harvnb|Akkerman|Houben|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}} and vacant between the death of [[Marie Anne de Bourbon (1697–1741)]] and the appointment of [[Princess Marie Louise of Savoy|Marie Louise of Savoy-Carignan, Princesse de Lamballe]] in 1775.

*The second highest rank was that of the ''[[Première dame d'honneur]]'', who could act as the stand-in of the Surintendante&lt;ref name="Duindam date? page?"/&gt; and had about the same tasks, hiring and supervising the female courtiers and the queen's daily routine and expenditure.&lt;ref name="Akkerman Houben date?, page?"/&gt; This post was created in 1523 and had originally been highest female court office.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}}
*The 3rd rank belonged to the ''[[dame d'atour]]'', who formally supervised the queen's wardrobe and jewelry and the dressing of the queen.&lt;ref name="Akkerman Houben date?, page?"/&gt; This post was created in 1534.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}}

*The 4th rank was that of the ''dames'', from 1523 named ''dame d'honneur''{{sfn|Kolk|2009}} composed of ladies-in-waiting whose task was simply to serve as companions and attending and assisting with court functions.&lt;ref name="Akkerman Houben date?, page?"/&gt;
*The 5th rank was the ''filles d'honneur'' or ''demoiselles d'honneur'' (maid of honour), unmarried daughters of the nobility, who had the same tasks as the ''dames'' but was mainly placed at court to learn etiquette and look for a spouse.&lt;ref name="Akkerman Houben date?, page?"/&gt; They were supervised by the ''gouvernante'' and the ''sous-gouvernante''.&lt;ref name="Akkerman Houben date?, page?"/&gt; The position of ''filles d'honneur'' and ''dames'' was abolished in 1674, and replaced by the ''dame du palais'', twelve married noblewomen with the same tasks.&lt;ref name="Duindam date? page?" /&gt; The ''filles'' were from 1531 supervised by the ''Gouvernante de filles'', a lady-in-waiting who had the task to chaperone them: this post was divided in to several from 1547 onward.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}}

*The 6th rank were the ''[[première femme de Chambre]]'', who in turn over ranked the remaining ''femme de chambres'' and ''lavandières''.&lt;ref name="Duindam date? page?"/&gt; The premiere femme de chambre had the keys to the queens rooms and could recommend and deny audiences to her, which in practice made her position very powerful at court.&lt;ref name="Akkerman Houben date?, page?"/&gt;

During the [[First French Empire|First Empire]], the principal lady in waiting of the empress was the ''dame d'honneur'', followed by between 20 and 36 ''dames du palais''.{{sfn|Mansel|p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}} During the [[Bourbon Restoration]], [[Marie Thérèse of France]] restored the pre-revolutionary court hierarchy.{{sfn|Nagel|2008|p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}} During the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], the female courtiers of the empress was composed by the first rank ''Grand-Maitresse '' and the second rank ''dame d'honneur'',  followed by six (later twelve) ''dames du palais''.{{sfn|Seward|2004|p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

===Germany===
The early modern Princely courts in Germany were modeled after the imperial Austrian court model.&lt;ref name="Akkerman 2013"/&gt; This court model divided the ladies-in-waiting in an chief lady-in-waiting named ''Oberhofmeisterin'' (a widowed or married elder woman) who supervised the ''hoffräulein'' (maids of honour), of which one or two could be promoted to the middle rank of ''Kammerfräulein'' (maid of honour of the chamber).&lt;ref name="Akkerman 2013"/&gt; The princely German courts in turn became the role model of the Scandinavian courts of Denmark and Sweden in the 16th-century.&lt;ref name="Persson 1999"/&gt;

After the end of the German [[Holy Roman Empire|Roman Holy Empire]] in 1806 and the establishment of several minor kingdoms in Germany, the post of ''Staatsdame'' (married ladies-in-waiting) were introduced in many German princely and royal courts. At the Imperial German court, the ladies-in-waiting were composed of one ''Oberhofmeisterin'' in charge of several ''Hofstaatsdamen'' or ''Palastdamen''.{{sfn|Zedlitz-Trützschler|1924|p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

===Greece===
During the [[Byzantine Empire]], the Byzantine empress was attended by a female court (the ''sekreton tōn gynaikōn''), which consisted mostly of the wives of high-ranking male court officials, who simply wore the feminine versions of their husbands' titles. The only specifically female dignity was that of the ''[[Zoste patrikia]]'', the chief lady-in-waiting and female attendant of the empress, who was the head of the women's court and often a relative of the empress; this title existed at least since the 9th-century.

The [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]] was established in 1832 and its first queen [[Amalia of Oldenburg]] organized the ladies-in-waiting of its first royal court in one Grande-Maitresse, followed by the second rank ''dame d'honneur'', and the third rank ''dame de palais''.{{sfn|''Almanach de Gotha''| 1859|p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

===Italy===

Prior to unification, the greatest of the Italian states was the Kingdom of Naples, later called Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.  The ladies-in-waiting of the of queen the Two Sicilies were, in 1842 composed of one ''Dama di Onore'' or 'Lady of Honor', placed in rank as number two after the ''Cavaliere di Onore'', and followed by three ''Dama di Compagnia'' or 'Lady Companions' (number four in rank after the Cavalerizzo) and a large number of ''Dame di Corte'' or 'Court Ladies'. &lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.se/books?id=UqBjAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA692&amp;lpg=PA692&amp;dq=dama+di+compagnia+dama+di+corte+napoli&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iH-kH01XPF&amp;sig=cQkf2I65wExyLtIkmKMEIfHaSgQ&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj06s-CgqTcAhUyyKYKHdXJA8UQ6AEITDAE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  Almanacco reale del regno delle Due Sicilie]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy was united in to the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861.  The ladies-in-waiting of the queen of Italy was headed by the ''Dama d’Onore'', followed by the ''Dame di Corte'', and finally the ''Dame di Palazzo''.&lt;ref&gt;Calendario reale per l'anno 1879 {{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dama d’Onore was nominally the chief lady-in-waiting, but in practice often limited her service to state occasions; the ''Dame di Corte'' was the regular ladies-in-waiting who personally attended to the queen, while the ''Dame di Palazzo'' was honorary courtiers attached to the royal palaces in particular cities, such as Florence, Turin and so forth, and only served temporary when the queen visited the city in question: among these, only the ''Dame di Palazzo'' attached to the royal palace of the capital of Rome served more than temporary.&lt;ref&gt;la Repubblica.it, 2007, 11, 25, La dama di compagnia dell' ultima Regina {{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[File:Tosa Mitsuoki 002.JPG|thumb|[[Murasaki Shikibu]]]]

In Japan, the imperial court offices was normally reserved for members of the court aristocracy and the ladies-in-waiting or ''palace attendants'' were commonly educated members of the nobility.&lt;ref name="Lillehoj date? page?"&gt;{{harvnb|Lillehoj|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

During the [[Heian period]] (794–1185) women could hold court offices of substantial responsibility, managing the affairs of the emperor.&lt;ref name="Lillehoj date? page?"/&gt; Female palace attendants were employed by the imperial Bureau of Palace Attendants from among the court aristocracy, but were required to be of sufficient education in Chinese classics to be accepted.&lt;ref name=" Rowley date? page?"&gt;{{harvnb|Rowley|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

During the [[Sengoku period]] (1467–1603), the highest rank of a lady-in-waiting was "female assistant to the major counselor", who ran the affairs of the daily life of the imperial household.&lt;ref name="Lillehoj date? page?"/&gt; The second rank was ''hoto no naishi'' ("female palace attendant"), who acted as intermediary between the emperor and those seeking audience and issued his wishes in writing.&lt;ref name="Lillehoj date? page?"/&gt; Ladies-in-waiting acted as imperial secretaries and noted the events at court, visitors and gifts in the official court journals.&lt;ref name="Lillehoj date? page?"/&gt;

In contrast to China, women ''palace attendants'' managed the palace of the imperial harem rather than [[eunuch]]s, and could hold high court offices in the emperors personal household.&lt;ref name=" Rowley date? page?"/&gt;
Female palace attendants were divided in two classes, which in turn had several ranks, signifying their task.&lt;ref name="Lebra  date? page?"&gt;{{harvnb|Lebra|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}} The first class consisted of the ''nyokan'' or ladies-in-waiting who held court offices, ''naishi-kami'' (shoji) ''naishi-suke'' (tenji) and ''naishi-no-jo'' (shoji) and the second class was the female palace attendants ''myobu'', ''osashi'', ''osue'', ''nyoju''.&lt;ref name="Lebra  date? page?"/&gt; The ladies-in-waiting worked as personal assistants, tending the emperors' wardrobe, assisting the emperors' baths, serving meals, performing and attending court rituals.&lt;ref name=" Rowley date? page?"/&gt; Ladies-in-waiting could be appointed concubines, consorts or even empresses by the emperor or the heir to the throne.&lt;ref name=" Rowley date? page?"/&gt; The function of a lady-in-waiting as potential concubine was abolished in 1924.&lt;ref name=" Rowley date? page?"/&gt;

''[[Gungnyeo]]'' (literally "palace women") is a Korean term referring to women who wait upon the King and other royalty in traditional [[Korean society]]. It is short for ''gungjung yeogwan'', which translates as "a lady officer of the royal court".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The term is also used more broadly to encompass women in a lower class without a rank such as ''[[musuri]]'' (lowest maids in charge of odd chores), ''gaksimi'', ''sonnim'', ''[[uinyeo]]'' (female physicians) as well as ''nain'' and ''sanggung''.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=255134&amp;v=42 |script-title=ko:궁녀 (宮女) |publisher=[[Empas]] / [[EncyKorea]] |language=Korean, English}}{{Request quotation|date=April 2017|reason=Most English readers can not understand the script used in this citation so provide a translation either on the talk page or in a footnote (see [[WP:NONENG]]) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=116737&amp;v=42 |script-title=ko:궁녀 (宮女) |publisher=[[Empas]] / [[Britannica]] |language=Korean, English}}{{Request quotation|date=April 2017|reason=Most English readers can not understand the script used in this citation so provide a translation either on the talk page or in a footnote (see [[WP:NONENG]])}}{{dead  link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
The court of the Duchy of Burgundy, which was situated in the Netherlands in the 15th-century, was famous for its elaborate ceremonial court life and became a role model for several other courts of Europe.{{sfn|Kolk|2009}} The Burgundian court model came to be the role model for the Austrian imperial court during the 16th-century, when the Burgundian Netherlands and Austria was united through the Habsburg dynasty.&lt;ref name="Duindam date? page?"/&gt;

In the 16th-century, the ladies-in-waiting in the courts of the Habsburg governors of the Netherlands, Margaret of Austria and [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)]], was composed of one ''hofmeesteres'' ('Court mistress') or ''dame d'honneur'' who served as the principal lady in waiting; one ''hofdame'' or ''Mere de filles'', who was second in rank and deputy of the ''hofmesterees'' as well as being in charge of the ''eredames'' (maid of honour), also known as ''demoiselle d'honneur'', ''fille d'honneur'' or ''Junckfrauen'', and finally the chamber maids, ''kameniersters'', all with different titles depending on language in the multilingual area of the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Kerkhoff date? page?"/&gt;

The [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was founded in 1815, signifying the organisation of a royal court. In the 19th-century, the ladies-in-waiting of the Dutch court was headed by the ''Grootmeesteres'' ('Grand Mistress', equivalent to Mistress of the Robes), of second rank was the ''Dames du Palais'' (married ladies-in-waiting), followed by the third rank ''Hofdames'' ('court ladies', equivalent to maid of honour).{{sfn|Hamer|2011|p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;S Gravenhaagsche” Stads-Almanak: voor 1857&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} 

*Princess [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]] had a total of seven ''Hofdames'' ('court ladies'). They accompanied the Queen and the other female members of the Royal House during visits and receptions at the Royal Court. The monarch paid for their expenses, but they did not receive any salary. Not all of these ladies were members of the Dutch aristocracy, but each had a "notable" husband. Excellent social behavior and discretion was the most important recommendation for becoming a ''Hofdame''. In 2012 the ''Hofdames'' were Ietje van Karnebeek-van Lede, Lieke Gaarlandt-van Voorst van Beest, Julie Jeekel-Thate, Miente Boellaard-Stheeman, ''[[Jonkheer|Jonkvrouwe]]'' Reina de Blocq van Scheltinga, Elizabeth Baroness van Wassenaer-Mersmans and Bibi Baroness van Zuylen van Nijevelt-''Jonkvrouwe'' den Beer Poortugael. [[Queen Maxima of the Netherlands]] reduced the number of ''Hofdames'' to three, hers being: Lieke Gaarlandt-van Voorst van Beest, Pien van Karnebeek-Thijssen and Annemijn Crince le Roy- van Munster van Heuven. After their voluntary retirement, ''Hofdames'' were appointed to the honorary Royal Household. The honorary Royal Household still distinguishes between ''Dames du Palais'' and ''Hofdames'', but the category ''Dames du Palais'' is slated for discontinuation.
*The ''Grootmeesteres'' (Grandmistress) was the highest-ranking lady at the Royal Court. From 1984 until 2014 the position was held by [[Martine van Loon-Labouchere]], descendant of the famous banker family, a former diplomat and the widow of ''[[Jonkheer]]'' [[Maurits van Loon]] of the famous Amsterdam canal estate. The current ''Grootmeesteres'' is Bibi [[Countess]] van Zuylen van Nijevelt-den Beer Poortugael (lady-in-waiting from 2011 - 2014).

===Norway===
During the union of [[Denmark-Norway]] from 1380 until 1814, the Danish royal court in Copenhagen was counted as the Norwegian royal court, and thus there was not royal court present in Norway during this period. During the union between Norway and Sweden from 1814 to 1905, there were Norwegian courtiers appointed who served during the Swedish royal family's visits to Norway. The female courtiers were appointed according to the Swedish court model, that is to say the class of ''hovfröken'' (Maid of honor); ''kammarfröken'' (Chief Maid of Honor) and ''statsfru'' (Lady of the Bedchamber), all supervised by the ''[[overhoffmesterinne]]'' (Mistress of the Robes): these posts were first appointed in 1817.{{sfn|Hauge|Egeberg|1960||p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}} When the union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved in 1905, a permanent Norwegian royal court was established.

===Russia===
In the court of [[Muscovite Russia]], the offices of lady-in-waiting to the [[Tsarina]] were normally divided among the ''boyarinas'' (widows or wives of [[boyar]]s), often from the family and relatives of the Tsarina.&lt;ref&gt;И. Е. Забелин. Глава VI. Царицын дворовый чин // Домашний быт русских цариц в XVI и XVII столетиях. — М.: Типография Грачева и Комп., 1869.{{Request quotation|date=April 2017|reason=Most English readers can not understand the script used in this citation so provide a translation either on the talk page or in a footnote (see [[WP:NONENG]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first rank among the offices of the ladies-in-waiting were the Tsarina's [[Treasurer]]; the second were the group of companions; the third were the royal nurses to the princes and princesses (where the nurses of the male children over ranked); among the nurses, the most significant post was that of the ''mamok'', the head royal governess, who were normally selected from elder widows, often relatives to the Tsar or Tsarina.&lt;ref name="Most English readers"&gt;Верховая боярыня // Энциклопедический словарь Брокгауза и Ефрона : в 86 т. (82 т. и 4 доп.). — СПб., 1890—1907.{{Request quotation|date=April 2017|reason=Most English readers can not understand the script used in this citation so provide a translation either on the talk page or in a footnote (see [[WP:NONENG]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; All offices were appointed by royal decree. The group of ladies-in-waiting were collectively above the rank of the ''Svetlichnaya'', the tsarina's sewing women; the ''postelnitsy'' (the tsarina's chamber women and washing women) and the officials who handled the affairs of the staff.&lt;ref name="Most English readers"/&gt;

In 1722, this system was abolished and the Russian Imperial court was reorganized in accordance with the reforms of Peter the Great to Westernize Russia, and the old court offices of the Tsarina was replaced with court offices inspired by the German model; see [[Lady-in-waiting of the Imperial Court of Russia]].

===Spain===
The royal court of Castile included a group of ladies-in-waiting for the queen named ''camarera'' in late 13th-century and early 14th-century, but it was not until the 15th-century that a set organisation of the ladies-in-waiting is confirmed.&lt;ref name="Cruz and Stampino  date? page?"&gt;{{harvnb|Cruz|Stampino|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=April 2017}} This characteristic organisation of the Spanish ladies-in-waiting was roughly established already during the reign of [[Isabella I of Castile]] (r. 1474–1504), was kept by Empress Isabella during the 16th century, and became the standard Spanish court model for ladies-in-waiting.&lt;ref name="Cruz and Stampino  date? page?"/&gt;

*The highest rank female courtier was the ''[[Camarera mayor de Palacio]]'' ([[Mistress of the Robes]]).&lt;ref name="Akkerman 2013"/&gt; This office is confirmed from the 1410s.&lt;ref name="Cruz and Stampino  date? page?"/&gt;
*The second rank was shared by the ''ayas'' (royal governess), and the ''guardas'' (chaperones).&lt;ref name="Akkerman 2013"/&gt;  
*The third rank was the ''dueñas de honor'', the married ladies-in-waiting, who were responsible for not only the unmarried ''damas'' or ''meninas'' ([[Maid of honour]]), but also of the female slaves and dwarfs, who were classified as courtiers and ranked before the ''mozas'' (maids) and ''lavanderas'' (washer women).&lt;ref name="Akkerman 2013"/&gt; 

===Sweden===
The early modern Swedish court, as well as the Danish equivalent, were re-organized in the early 16th century according to the German court model, in turn inspired by the Imperial Austrian court model.&lt;ref name="Persson 1999"/&gt;
This model roughly organized the female noble courtiers in the class of the unmarried ''hovfröken'' ([[maid of honor]], until 1719 ''hovjungfru'') which could be promoted to ''kammarfröken'' (Chief Maid of Honor: until 1719 ''kammarjungfru'').&lt;ref name="Persson 1999"/&gt; They were supervised by the ''hovmästarinna'' (Court Mistress, equivalent to [[Mistress of the Robes]]), normally a married or widowed elder noblewoman.&lt;ref name="Persson 1999"/&gt; Under this class of female noble courtiers, were the non-noble female servants. They were headed by the normally married ''kammarfru'' (Mistress of the Chamber, roughly equivalent to a Ladies Maid), often of burgher background, who supervised the group of ''kammarpiga'' (Chamber Maid)&lt;ref name="Persson 1999"/&gt;

From the reign of [[Queen Christina of Sweden|Queen Christina]], the ''[[hovmästarinna]]'' was supervised by the ''[[överhovmästarinna]]'' (Chief Court Mistress).&lt;ref name="Persson 1999"/&gt; In 1774, the post of ''statsfru'' (Mistress of the State) was introduced, which was the title for the group of married ladies-in-waiting with rank between the ''hovmästarinna'' and the ''[[kammarfröken]]''.&lt;ref name=rundquist&gt;{{harvnb|Rundquist|1989||p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=April 2017}} The Swedish court staff was reduced in size in 1873.&lt;ref name=rundquist/&gt; The new court protocols of 1911 and 1954 continued this reduction, and many court posts was abolished or no longer filled.

With the exception of the ''statsfru'' and the ''överhovmästarinna'', none of the titles above are longer in use. At the death of Queen Louise in 1965, her ''överhovmästarinna'' was employed by the King. From 1994, the ''överhovmästarinna'' are the head of the court of the King rather than the Queen, while the court of the Queen is headed by the ''statsfru''. There are now only one ''statsfru'', and the other ladies-in-waiting are simply referred to as ''hovdam'' ('Court Lady'). [[Queen Silvia of Sweden]] has only three ''hovdamer'' ('court ladies'). Her chief lady-in-waiting is the ''statsfru''.

'''Law enforcement in Australia''' is one of the three major components of the country's [[justice]] system, along with [[Judiciary of Australia|courts]] and [[Punishment in Australia|corrections]]. There are law enforcement officers employed by all three levels of government – [[Government of Australia|federal]], [[States and territories of Australia|state / territory]], and [[Local government in Australia|local]].

Federally, the main law enforcement agency is the [[Australian Federal Police]] (AFP), which has a wide mandate to enforce [[Criminal law of Australia|Australian criminal law]] and protect its national interests. There are also a number of other agencies that have powers confined to specific areas, such as national security ([[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation|ASIO]]), customs and immigration ([[Australian Border Force|ABF]]), and white-collar crime ([[Australian Taxation Office|ATO]], [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|ACCC]], [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission|ASIC]]). Each branch of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) has its own [[military police]], although there is also an overarching [[Australian Defence Force Investigative Service|ADF Investigative Service]] for more complex investigations.

As each Australian state enacts its own laws, general law enforcement duties are the responsibility of [[state police]] forces, who are in turn responsible to a government minister (usually the Minister for Police). These forces carry out the bulk of general policing throughout the entire state, including in metropolitan areas. Other state-government departments may also have investigative powers for specific offences within their purview. The [[Northern Territory]] also has its own police force, but in Australia's other territories (including the [[Australian Capital Territory]]) law enforcement is handled by the federal government.

Australian state and federal police routinely carry firearms. While on duty, most officers' duty belts consist of  a handgun, a [[Taser]],  an [[Baton (law enforcement)|expandable baton]], [[Pepper Spray|pepper spray]], a set of [[handcuffs]], ammunition magazines, gloves, [[flashlight|torch]] and a [[two-way radio]]. Local governments have their own smaller force of authorised officers – known as [[council ranger]]s – to enforce local laws pertaining solely to individual local government jurisdictions. Council rangers generally do not have full police powers (unless they are sworn as [[Special constable#Australia|special constables]]).

==Federal==
===Australian Federal Police===
The primary federal law enforcement agency in Australia is the [[Australian Federal Police]]. The AFP are responsible for the investigation of federal offences (crimes against the Commonwealth) and have federal jurisdiction throughout Australia. They provide protective services to federal government property and personnel/dignitaries, including major airports, buildings, foreign embassies/diplomats etc. and provide state-styled law enforcement services to external territories and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (and in turn [[Jervis Bay Territory]]), the only of the two major mainland territories to not maintain its own state(/territory) police. The boundaries between the two levels of law enforcement are somewhat flexible and both state and federal police co-operate on or transfer cases between each other depending on the specific circumstances. State police can enforce federal, state and local laws, but federal police cannot enforce state or local laws.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The AFP also provides liaison officers to various overseas posts to assist in relations with various police forces overseas, as well as providing community policing to assist in the development of foreign law enforcement agencies and peacekeeping operations in locations such as the Solomon Islands with the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|RAMSI Mission]] and Cyprus.

The AFP was created in 1979, having been the result of an amalgamation of the now defunct [[Commonwealth Police]] and Australian Capital Territory Police Force. This makes it quite young as many of the various state police forces were established in the 19th century.

===Australian Border Force===

The [[Australian Border Force]] is responsible for customs and immigration enforcement and border protection at Australia's ports as well as in Australian waters, and conducts investigations where the AFP does not have primary jurisdiction. Unlike AFP Officers, Border Force Officers do not have fully vested federal police powers, only arrest and detain powers at Airport jurisdiction. They may however detain persons for state or federal crimes or [[Arrest warrant|warrants]] until that person can be presented to a federal or state law enforcement officer with the appropriate powers. Australian Border Force officers have the authority to carry firearms where a supervisor gives approval. In practice only maritime officers and specialist counter terrorism officers carry firearms.

==Military==
[[Military police|Military Police]], also known as Service Police, are the law enforcement branches of the services of a military tasked with enforcing, and investigating offences against, military law. In Australia, each service of the [[Australian Defence Force]] maintains its own independent police force made up of military personnel from that service. Along with the independent service police forces is the [[Australian Defence Force Investigative Service]], a special ADF unit made up of Investigators from each service's police and tasked with investigating more serious military offences.

===Australian Army Military Police===
Law enforcement duties in the Australian Army are provided by the [[Royal Australian Corps of Military Police]]. MPs provide everything from general law enforcement duties on military installations to investigations, close personal protection and more.

==National common policing services==
The Australia New Zealand Policing Advisory Agency (ANZPAA)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anzpaa.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; was established in October 2007. ANZPAA is a joint initiative of the Australian and New Zealand Police Commissioners and funded by contributions to Australia and New Zealand Police jurisdictions. ANZPAA is a non-operational policing agency which provides strategy and policy advice, and secretariat services to the ANZPAA Board on cross-jurisdictional policing initiatives that help enhance community safety and security. ANZPAA's strategic direction is set by ANZPAA’s board and the Australia New Zealand Council of Police Professionalisation (ANZCoPP, formerly Australasian Police Professional Standards Committee, APPSC). More information [http://www.anzpaa.org.au www.anzpaa.org.au]

The Australasian Police Professional Standards Committee (APPSC) was an organisation that served all police jurisdictions around Australia and New Zealand. It was the body for police education and training in Australia and New Zealand; the council comprising each of the police commissioners from Australia and New Zealand along with the president of the [[Police Federation of Australia]] and the president of the New Zealand Police Association. On 9 November 2007, APPSC roles and functions were amalgamated into ANZPAA. In 2013, APPSC was retitled to the Australia New Zealand Council of Police Professionalisation.

[[Crime Stoppers Australia|Crime Stoppers]] programs run in each state and nationally. Crime Stoppers collects information about crime and passes it on to the police ensuring that the community can participate in crime fighting.

[[CrimTrac]] is an intergovernmental policing agency that supports Australian policing through the provision of [[forensic]] and other information and investigative tools between state and federal police departments. The [[National Automated Fingerprint Identification System]] (NAFIS) is national [[fingerprint]] database, administered by CrimTrac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimtrac.gov.au/|title=CrimTrac|author=The CrimTrac Agency|work=crimtrac.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State==
Each [[States and territories of Australia|state]] as well as the [[Northern Territory]] is responsible for maintaining its own police force which is responsible for policing at the state and local level. This involves general law and order, traffic policing, major crime, anti-terrorism branches, water police, search and rescue and in some states transit police. Local policing in the [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[Jervis Bay Territory]] and Australia's external territories is contracted to the [[Australian Federal Police]] (AFP).

In some states, [[local government]]s employ by-laws officers or rangers to enforce local [[by-laws]] or [[local ordinance|ordinances]] relating to such matters as parking, dog ownership, retailing, [[litter]]ing or water usage. These local government officers are not considered to be police forces as they generally only have the power to issue fines and do not have the same powers as state police. They may rely upon appointment as a [[Special constable#Australia|special constable]] or legislated powers for their authority.

===Policing agencies===
[[State police]] also perform certain functions on behalf of the Australian government such as the enforcement of various Commonwealth Acts and regulations in conjunction with the Australian Federal Police and other Commonwealth officers.

While [[ACT Policing|ACT policing]] is under the jurisdiction of the [[Australian Federal Police]], the following policing agencies are regulated by their respective state or territory government and are highly visible:
* [[New South Wales Police Force]]
* [[Northern Territory Police]]
* [[Queensland Police]]
* [[South Australia Police]]
* [[Tasmania Police]]
* [[Victoria Police]]
* [[Western Australia Police]]

===Sheriffs===
In recent years, the states and territories have returned the responsibility of recovering court ordered fines to their sheriffs. In practice, the police often carry out the functions of sheriffs and bailiffs in rural and more sparsely populated areas of Australia.

The office of sheriff was first established in Australia in 1824. This was simultaneous with the appointment of the first [[Chief Justice of New South Wales]]. The role of the sheriff has not been static, nor is it identical in each Australian state. In the past a shefiff's duties included: executing court judgements, acting as a [[coroner]], the transportation of prisoners, managing the [[jail]]s, and carrying out executions (through the employment of an anonymous [[executioner|hangman]]).

Currently, no Australian state provides for capital punishment. A government department (usually called the Department of Corrections or similar) now runs the prison system and the coroner's office handles coronial matters. The sheriff is now largely responsible for enforcing the civil orders and fines of the court by seizing and selling the property of judgement debtors who do not satisfy the debt, providing court security, enforcing arrest warrants, evictions, taking juveniles into custody and running the jury system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Office of the Sheriff of New South Wales|url = http://www.courts.justice.nsw.gov.au/Pages/cats/catscorporate_aboutus/catscorporate_officeofsheriff/catscorporate_officeofsheriff.aspx|website = www.courts.justice.nsw.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some state sheriffs can also apply a wide range of sanctions ranging from suspending driver's licences and car registration through to [[wheel clamp]]ing and arranging [[community service]] orders, and as a last resort can make arrests.

===Local===
[[Council ranger]]s are officers employed by local government areas in Australia to enforce the by-laws (local laws in [[Western Australia]]); of those local governments and a limited range of state laws relating to such matters as litter control, [[Animal control officer|animal control]], dog laws, fire control, off-road vehicles, emergency management, and parking. Unless they are also sworn in as [[Special constable#Australia|special constable]]s, as many are, rangers do not have full police powers. Council rangers are also referred to as local laws officers in some of Australia's eastern states. Most [[Council ranger]]s have the power to issue fines that don't exceed a certain amount.

==Transportation==
[[File:2016 Holden Commodore (VF II) SV6 sedan (2017-11-18).jpg|thumb|left|Unmarked Police [[Holden Commodore (VF)|Holden Commodore]].]]

[[File:Toyota Aurion 306THV Queensland Police (TOYOTA CAMRY (cropped)).JPG|thumb|[[Queensland Police]] [[Toyota Aurion]]]]
By agreement between the various commissioners, most police cars in Australia are predominantly white, with a blue and white [[Sillitoe Tartan|Sillitoe tartan]] checkered strip on the side. Some jurisdictions' [[highway patrol]] units and police also have fluorescent stripes surrounding the tartan. Most general patrol cars are [[Holden Commodore]]s, [[Toyota Camry]]s, or [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcons]], but with Australian production of all models ending as of 2017, replacements have been sought, including the [[Chrysler 300]] SRT, [[BMW 5 Series (G30)|BMW 530d]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.msn.com/en-au/motoring/news/new-nsw-police-cars-confirmed-at-last/ar-AAtppKQ|title=New NSW Police cars confirmed at last|author=Andrew Chesterton|date=2017-10-16|publisher=MSN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-news/chrysler-300-srt-and-bmw-530d-confirmed-for-nsw-police-68997|title=Chrysler 300 SRT and BMW 530d confirmed for NSW Police|author=Tim Robson|date=2018-05-21|publisher=CarsGuide}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Kia Stinger]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dowling |first1=Joshua |title=Queensland Police deploy Kia Stinger highway patrol cars |url=https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/motoring-news/queensland-police-deploy-kia-stinger-highway-patrol-cars/news-story/082e1d57d9b95f8e098ffef6bf845394 |accessdate=11 July 2018 |date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisoner transport vehicles are based on [[light commercial vehicle]]s such as the [[Ford Ranger (T6)|Ford Ranger]], [[Toyota Hilux]], [[Holden Ute]], [[Mercedes Vito]] or [[Volkswagen Transporter]]. Highway Patrol vehicles are higher performance sedans, often in colours other than white - often [[Holden Commodore SS]], [[Ford Falcon XR6]]  or [[Toyota Aurion]].

A wide range of vehicles are used for unmarked purposes so as to not be easily identified as police. Many of these vehicles are also specifically chosen to fit in with civilian vehicles.

Emergency lights on police vehicles are now generally blue and red; historically though, blue lights were used for police vehicles and red lights for fire engines and ambulances.

Police are now increasingly employing the use of a diverse range unmarked police cars. These vehicles include, besides the Commodore and the Falcon, the [[Chrysler 300|Chrysler 300C]], [[Toyota Aurion]], [[Toyota Corolla]], Ford and Holden Ute, [[Ford Focus (international)|Ford Focus]] XR5, [[Subaru Impreza WRX]], and the [[Volkswagen Golf]]. In rural areas, SUVs such as the [[Toyota Land Cruiser]], [[Mitsubishi Pajero]], [[Ford Territory (Australia)|Ford Territory]] and [[Nissan Patrol]]  are used.

Most Australian police services have mounted police units that are prominently used for ceremonial purposes, although in [[New South Wales]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] the mounted police also undertake operational policing duties on a daily basis.

{{Contains special characters}}
'''Lisu''' (Lisu: {{lang|lis|ꓡꓲ-ꓢꓴ}} or {{lang|lis|ꓡꓲꓢꓴ}}; {{zh|c=傈僳语|p=lìsùyǔ}}; {{lang-my|လီဆူဘာသာစကား}}, {{IPA-my|lìsʰù bàðà zəɡá|pron}}) is a [[tonal language|tonal]] [[Tibeto-Burman]] language spoken in [[Yunnan]] (southwestern [[China]]), northern [[Burma]] (Myanmar), and [[Thailand]] and a small part of [[India]]. Along with [[Lipo language|Lipo]], it is one of two languages of the [[Lisu people]]. Lisu has many dialects that originate from the country in which they live. Hua Lisu, Pai Lisu, and Lu Shi Lisu dialects are spoken in China. Although they are mutually intelligible, some have many more loan words from other languages than others.&lt;!--Which ones? There are only three.--&gt;

The Lisu language is closely related to the [[Lahu language|Lahu]] and [[Akha language|Akha]] languages and is also related to [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Jingpho language|Jingphaw]], and [[Yi languages]].

==Dialects==
Lisu can be split up into three dialects: northern, central, and southern, with northern being the standard.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite web|url= http://faculty.washington.edu/zhandel/Handel_Lisu.pdf |title=Proto-Lolo–Burmese velar clusters and the origin of Lisu palatal sibilant }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(76.2&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bradley (2003)===
Bradley (2003) lists the following three Lisu dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, David. 2003. "Lisu". In Thurgood, Graham and Randy J. LaPolla (eds.) (2003). ''The Sino-Tibetan Languages''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-7007-1129-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Northern''' ({{IPA|/lo˧˥nɛ̱˦/}} 'Black Lo' (autonym), {{IPA|/lo˧˥wu˥/}} 'Northern Lo' (name given by other Lisu)): northwest [[Yunnan]], [[Kachin state|extreme northern Burma]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]], India
*'''Central''' ({{IPA|/ɕɑ̱˦ɕɑ̱˦/}} Flowery Lisu or Hua Lisu): western Yunnan, northeastern Burma
*'''Southern''' ({{IPA|/lo˧˥ʂɨ˧/}} 'Yellow Lo'): extreme southwestern Yunnan, Shan State of Burma, Thailand

===Mu &amp; Sun (2012)===
In the introduction of ''A Study of Lisu dialects'' (傈僳语方言研究), Mu &amp; Sun (2012) split Lisu into 3 dialects.
*'''Nujiang 怒江方言''': 550,000 speakers in Nujiang Prefecture (all counties), Baoshan Prefecture (all counties), Dehong Prefecture (some counties), Lincang Prefecture (some counties), Dali Prefecture (a few counties), and Weixi County
*'''Luquan 禄劝方言''': 65,000 speakers in parts of Chuxiong Prefecture (in Luquan County, Wuding County, etc.), and parts of neighboring prefectures
*'''Yongsheng 永胜方言''': 18,000 speakers in the counties of Yongsheng, Huaping, Panzhihua, Muli, Yanyuan, and others

Mu &amp; Sun (2012) compare a total of 5 datapoints in their comparative vocabulary table.
*'''Fugong 福贡''': 140,000 speakers in Fugong, Gongshan, Lanping, etc.
*'''Luquan 禄劝''' (autonym: ''li33 phɒ31'', [[Lipo language|Lipo]]): 45,000+ speakers in Binchuan, Wuding, Yuanmou, Dayao, Yao'an, Yongren, Dechang, Huili, Huidong, Yanyuan, etc.
*'''Weixi 维西''': 100,000+ speakers in Weixi, Deqin, Zhongdian, Lijiang, etc.
*'''Tengchong 腾冲''': 120,000+ speakers in Longling, Dehong Prefecture, Gengma, Simao, Lushui, [[Shan State]] (Burma), [[Chiang Mai]] (Thailand)
*'''Yongsheng 永胜''': 90,000+ speakers in Yongsheng, Huaping, Ninglang, Dayao, Yongren, Dechang, etc.

==Orthography==

===Pollard alphabet===
{{main|Pollard script}}
[[Sam Pollard]]'s [[A-Hmao language|A-Hmao]] was adapted to write [[Lipo language|Lipo]], another Lisoish language (sometimes called ''Eastern Lisu'') spoken by the Lisu people.

===Fraser alphabet===
{{Main|Fraser alphabet}}
The Lisu alphabet currently in use throughout Lisu-speaking regions in China, Burma, and Thailand was primarily developed by two Protestant missionaries from different missionary organizations.  The more famous of the two is [[James O. Fraser]], a British evangelist from the China Inland Mission.  His colleague, who developed the original version of the alphabet (later revised and improved with Fraser and various colleagues from the C.I.M.) was Sara Ba Thaw, a polyglot Karen preacher based in Myitkyina, Burma, who belonged to the American Baptist Mission.

Ba Thaw had prepared a simple Lisu catechism by 1915.  The script now widely known as the "Fraser alphabet" was finished by 1939, when Fraser's mission houses in the Lisu ethnic areas of Yunnan Province (China) received their newly printed copies of the Lisu New Testament.

===Lisu syllabary===
[[File:Lisu script.GIF|thumb|250px|Lisu syllabary]]
From 1924 to 1930, a Lisu farmer called Ngua-ze-bo (pronounced {{IPA-bodia|ŋua˥ze˧bo˦|}}; [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{Lang|zh|汪忍波/哇忍波}}) invented the [[Lisu syllabary]] from [[Chinese script]], [[Dongba script]] and [[Geba script]]. However, it looks more different from the Chinese script than [[Chu Nom]] and [[Sawndip]] (Zhuang logograms). Since Ngua-ze-bo initially carved his characters on bamboos, the syllabary is known as the Lisu Bamboo script (傈僳竹书). 

It has a total of 1250 glyphs and 880 characters.

===Latin Lisu alphabet===
A new Lisu alphabet based on [[pinyin]] was created in 1957, but most Lisu continued to use the old alphabet. The Fraser alphabet was officially recognized by the Chinese government in 1992, since which time its use has been encouraged.

===Burmese Lisu script===
In a few places in [[Myanmar]] in which Lisu is spoken, an orthography based on the [[Burmese alphabet]] has been developed and is taught to speakers and used in several publications and school books.

==Phonology==
The Lisu phonological inventory is as follows.&lt;ref&gt;David Bradley, 2003. "Lisu". In Thurgood &amp; LaPolla, ''The Sino-Tibetan languages''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels ===
{| class="wikitable IPA"

|}
{{IPA|[i]}} and the [[fricative vowel]] {{IPA|[ɨ]}} are in complementary distribution: {{IPA|[ɨ]}} is only found after palato-alveolars, though an alternate analysis is possible, with the palato-alveolars viewed as allophones of the palatals before {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[ɨ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://faculty.washington.edu/zhandel/Handel_Lisu.pdf |title=Proto-Lolo–Burmese velar clusters and the origin of Lisu palatal sibilant }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(76.2&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction originates from proto-Lolo–Burmese consonant clusters of the type *kr or *kj, which elsewhere merge, but where Lisu normally develops {{IPA|/i/}}, they remain distinct with the latter producing the type {{IPA|[tʃɨ]}}, the former the type {{IPA|[tɕi]}}. Inherited palatal affricates + {{IPA|/i/}} also become {{IPA|[tʃɨ]}}.

{{IPA|/y/}} is variable across dialects. It may be either [[endolabial]] or [[exolabial]], central {{IPA|[ʉ]}}, or even merged with {{IPA|/u/}}. The distinction between {{IPA|ɯ}} and {{IPA|ɤ}} is marginal, and both are written {{angle bracket|e}} in pinyin.

=== Tones ===
Lisu has 6 tones: high {{IPA|[˥]}}, mid creaky {{IPA|[˦ˀ]}}, mid {{IPA|[˧]}}, low {{IPA|[˨˩]}}, rising {{IPA|[˧˥]}}, and low checked {{IPA|[˨˩ʔ]}} (that is, {{IPA|[tá ta̰ ta tà tǎ tàʔ]}}). In some dialects the creaky tone is higher than mid tone, in others they are equal. The rising tone is infrequent, but common in baby talk (which has a stereotypical disyllabic low–rising pattern); both high and rising tone are uncommon after voiced consonants.

{{IPA|[v]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} are in complementary distribution, with {{IPA|[v]}} before [[front vowel]]s. {{IPA|/f/}} is marginal, occurring in a few words before {{IPA|/u/}} or {{IPA|/y/}}. The subdialect Fraser first encountered also distinguishes a retroflex series, {{IPA|/tʂ tʂʰ dʐ ʂ ʐ/}}, but only before {{IPA|/ɑ/}}.

Medial glides appear before {{IPA|/ɑ/}}. These are {{IPA|/w/}} with velars and {{IPA|/j/}} with bilabials and {{IPAslink|h̃}}. The latter consonant (see [[rhinoglottophilia]]) has a non-nasal allophone in the imperative particle {{IPA|[hɑ́]}}. {{IPA|/ɣ/}} is only distinctive before {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, and in some dialects is merged with {{IPA|/j/}}.

In Southern Lisu, the velar plosives become alveopalatal before front vowels. The vowels {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} trigger an offglide on preceding consonants, so {{IPA|/tu du te de/}} are pronounced {{IPA|[tfu dvu tje dje]}}.

The vowels {{IPA|ɯ ɤ}} do not occur initially—or, at least, in initial position they are pronounced {{IPA|[ɣɯ ɣɤ]}}. It has been argued that the initial vowels {{IPA|/i e y u ɯ ɤ/}} are phonetically {{IPA|[ji je fy fu ɣɯ ɣɤ]}}, so initial consonants do not need to be posited in such cases (and marginal {{IPA|/f/}} can be removed from the inventory of native words), or that they are phonemically {{IPA|/ʔV/}}, with glottal stop (Bradley 2003).

==Origin==

The community is traditionally associated with selling bangles and other traditionally jewellery. Little is known about the circumstances of their conversion to [[Islam]], although according to traditions took place some nine centuries ago. There relation to the [[Bisati]] community of [[North India]] is also unclear, although both groups are traditionally involved in peddling and hawking. The community is found mainly in the districts of [[Malda District|Malda]], [[Murshidabad District|Murshidabad]], [[24 Parganas]], [[Midnapore District|Midnapore]], [[Birbhum District|Birbhum]] and [[Howrah District|Howrah]]. They speak [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and belong to the [[Sunni]] sect. The Mal are also found in western [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 331-344&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The Besati Mal are a landless community, involved mainly in hawking. Smaller groups have taken to agriculture. The community buys its wares from [[Kolkata]], and then sells in the local markets. The Mal Besati live in multi-caste villages, although they occupy their own quarters known as paras. They are strictly endogamous, but have so system of clans. Each settlement includes a [[panchayat]] or [[caste]] council, that deals with community issues.&lt;ref&gt;Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 331-344&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mangbetu''', or ''Nemangbetu,'' is one of the most populous of the [[Central Sudanic languages]]. It is spoken by the [[Mangbetu people]] of northeastern Congo. It, or its speakers, are also known as ''Amangbetu, Kingbetu, Mambetto.'' The most populous dialect, and the one most widely understood, is called Medje. Others are Aberu (Nabulu), Makere, Malele, Popoi (Mapopoi). The most divergent is Lombi; ''Ethnologue'' treats it as a distinct language. About half of the population speaks [[Bangala language|Bangala]], a [[trade language]] similar to [[Lingala language|Lingala]], and in southern areas some speak [[Swahili language|Swahili]].

The Mangbetu live in association with the [[Asua people|Asua]] Pygmies, and [[Asoa language|their languages]] are closely related.

==Phonology==
One unusual feature of Mangbetu is that it has both a voiced and a voiceless [[bilabial trill]] as well as a [[labial flap]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5059863 Linguist Wins Symbolic Victory for 'Labiodental Flap'].

==History and origin==
Momin (Momna) is a major caste of Gujarat Muslims. The term "momin" in [[Arabic]] means someone who is a true follower of [[Islam]], and this term was given to [[Hindu]] converts from a number of castes who adopted the [[Shia]] faith. They were converted by Shia preachers.&lt;ref name="people"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The Momna are now divided into three endogamous groups, the [[Shia]] Momna found in Mehsana District, [[Ahmedabad]] city, and the [[taluka]]s of [[Dholka Taluka|Dholka]] and Dhandhuka of [[Ahmedabad district|Ahmadabad District]], the [[Sunni]] Momna who re-concentrated in fifty four villages of [[Wankaner]] and Morbi [[taluka]]s of [[Rajkot District]], also nine villages (Momin Navgam Sunni Jamat) of Sanand Taluka of Ahmedabad district and the [[Wahabi]] Momna of Mehsana and [[Banaskantha District]]s. Their mother tongue is [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. In addition to the three divisions, the Momna community are also divided into a number of clans, the main ones being the Kadivar, Bhoraniya, Aathiya, Shersia, Khorzia, Wankaneri, Paradha, Badi, Serasia, Vakalya, Dholkhawalia, Godhrawalia, Kapadia,Charoliya,Dekavadia, and Chaudhary, all of equal status. Their main occupation is farming, while many urban Momna are involved with weaving. Like other [[Gujarati Muslim]]s, the Momna have a caste association, the Momin Jamat.&lt;ref name="people"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Musicians Club of New York''' is a musicians' club based in [[New York City]]. It was founded in 1911 with the intent of providing a social platform for musicians in and around New York, but its mission later expanded to support and promote young musicians through prizes and scholarships, as well as provide recognition for contemporary composers. From 1979 it administered the Koussevitzky International Recording Award (KIRA), and since 1956 has presented the Young Artist Awards, now known as the Serge and Olga Koussevitzky Young Artist Awards.

== History ==

=== Founding and early years ===
[[File:(King1893NYC) pg245 DELMONICOS, BEAVER AND WILLIAMS STREETS.jpg|left|thumb|227x227px|[[Delmonico's]] on 2 South Williams Street, where some early club events were held]]The Musicians Club of New York was founded in 1911 by a group of musicians, composers, and educators looking to create a social organization for the musical community in New York City. As written on their certificate of incorporation, their mission statement was to “promote social intercourse among its members,” and two, for “the mutual benefit and pleasure and the advancement in the various branches of musical art of its members.” The thirty founders listed on the document, forming the first board of directors, included cellist [[Hans Kronold]], organist-composers [[Clarence Eddy]], [[C. B. Hawley]], and [[Frank Edwin Ward]], and first presidents [[Tali Esen Morgan]] and [[David Bispham]].&lt;ref&gt;''Our History''. 1956. MS, Club Archives. Box 1. Musicians Club of New York. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The club's first headquarters were at 62 West 45th Street in [[Midtown Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/83194864|title=Music and Musicians|work=Brooklyn Life|date=28 Dec 1912|page=30|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early club operations included various dinners and performances, held at such venues as the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]], [[Carnegie Hall]], and [[Delmonico's]], while performers included club members and musicians such as [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], [[Frances Alda]], [[Ernestine Schumann-Heink]], and [[Rudolph Ganz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/20509151|title=22 Mar 1914, Page 65 - The New York Times at Newspapers.com|last=|first=|date=|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-10-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to musical performances, events would also feature comedy performances, folk songs, and lectures, and were known for being attended by the musical elite; one 1916 dinner was attended by soprano [[Johanna Gadski]], violinist [[Fritz Kreisler]], and tenor [[Enrico Caruso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-w6AQAAMAAJ|title=New York Musicians' Club Dinner|last=|first=|date=March 16, 1916|work=Musical Courier|access-date=June 17, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=30–31|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A goal for some of these events was to provide a platform for contemporary American composers, who were considered underrepresented in the musical world. During its first decade the club hosted individual events dedicated to the works of composers such as [[Charles Wakefield Cadman]], [[Sidney Homer]], [[Mary Elizabeth Turner Salter|Mary Turner Salter,]] and [[Amy Beach]]; other women composers featured by the club during this period included [[Harriet Ware Krumbhaar|Harriet Ware]] and [[Gena Branscombe]], who would also continue to perform for the club for several more decades as a composer, conductor, and instrumentalist. From 1913 the club president was [[New York Symphony Orchestra]] conductor [[Walter Damrosch]], who helped attract interest in the club. During his presidency the club headquarters were moved to 14 West 12th Street, a building shared with the [[Civic Club / Estonian House|Civic Club]] that held a 250-seat auditorium and a [[roof garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Musicians' Club's house warming|last=|first=|date=17 October 1918|work=Musical Courier|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Musicians' Club of New York has new home|last=|first=|date=10 October 1918|work=The Music Magazine/Musical Courier|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damrosch was reported as president as late as 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Musicians Club of New York|last=|first=|date=June 1920|work=The Musical Monitor|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030273/19200920/ed1/seq9/|title=Composers to honor Sousa|last=|first=|date=September 20, 1920|work=The Sun and the New York herald|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=The New York Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he retained the title of honorary president until his death in 1950.

In 1918 the club held a fundraiser to provide support to French musicians who were struggling during [[World War I]], and the following year launched a campaign for a proposed “American Composers’ Fund”, through which American composers would be supported by government grants totaling from $200,000 to $1,000,000. While eventually unsuccessful, the initiative received support from figures such as composer [[Henry F. Gilbert]], arts patron [[Otto Hermann Kahn]], and Congressman [[John J. Eagan]], who at one point planned to propose a bill to [[United States Congress|Congress]] establishing such a fund, along with a national conservatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/63974618|title=8 Jun 1919, Page 30 - The Wichita Daily Eagle at Newspapers.com|last=|first=|date=|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-10-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frank La Forge and early scholarships ===
[[File:Frank La Forge in 1916.jpg|thumb|[[Frank La Forge]], president from 1935-1953]]
Under the presidency of teacher and accompanist [[Frank La Forge]], who began his tenure in 1935, the club endeavored to expand their mission to support young musicians and to foster general interest in [[classical music]]. The club fulfilled the first part of this mission by donating to music schools and sponsoring students at programs such as [[Tanglewood]]'s [[Berkshire Music Center]], and by 1953, the club estimated that it had contributed $1,500 to the cause of supporting young artists. That same year, La Forge suddenly died onstage at the age of 73 while performing piano at a club event in a [[Beekman (Panhellenic) Tower|Beekman Tower]] ballroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nyti.ms/2uvFUpY|title=Frank La Forge, 73, singing teacher|last=|first=|date=May 6, 1953|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, under president [[Norman Dello Joio]], the club first presented what came to be known as the Young Artist Awards, with the first winners being soprano [[Judith Raskin]] and baritone Carl White, who were awarded a total of $700.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nyti.ms/2utTjPj|title=Judith Raskin wins award|last=|first=|date=April 24, 1956|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later known as the Serge and Olga Koussevitzky Young Artist Awards, later recipients have included [[Jean Kraft]] (1959), [[Robert DeGaetano]] (1969), [[Paul Neubauer]] (1982) and [[François Salque]] (1994).

=== Koussevitzky years, KIRA, and 1979 reincorporation ===
In 1962 the presidency was assumed by [[Olga Koussevitzky]], widow of conductor and composer [[Serge Koussevitzky]] and friend to figures such as [[Aaron Copland]] and [[Leonard Bernstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olga Koussevitzky, widow of conductor|work=The New York Times|date=7 January 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been involved with education programs at [[Tanglewood Music Center]] and a figure behind the creation of a composers' studio near the premises, Koussevitzky expanded the club's reach in providing support for young musicians and underrepresented composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute to Olga Koussevitzky|url=http://www.musiciansclubofny.org/past-concerts/past-concert-1978-03-19-presenting-michael-blum-richard-frederickson-carol-crawford-sylvia-rabinof-dr-merle-montgovery-martin-bookspan-aaron-copland-norman-dello-joio-lukas-foss-henry-z-steinway-virgil-thomson-tribute-to-olga-koussevitzky|pages=29|date=19 March 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1968 she established a "Young Artists in Performance" series, as well as from 1973 a concert program at the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]] showcasing young artists, both of which were often broadcast on [[WNYC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=This week's radio concerts|last=|first=|date=February 15, 1970|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Koussevitsky's leadership the club also put on multiple concerts showcasing works by women composers, often exclusively American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1975-03-17|title=The journal.

In 1979, the Musicians Club reincorporated as a non-profit organization and received a grant from the [[Koussevitzky Foundation]]. Koussevitzky's involvement in the American International Music Fund (AIM), which administered the Koussevitzky International Recording Award (KIRA), also led to the organization being merged into the Musicians Club a year after her death in 1978. KIRA was established to award prizes for recorded works by contemporary composers, and since the acquisition has been awarded to composers such as [[Lucia Dlugoszewski]] (1980), [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] (1989 and 1993) and [[Stephen Jaffe]] (2004), as well as more well-known composers such as [[Pierre Boulez]] (1984) and [[Witold Lutosławski]] (1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musiciansclubofny.org/past-competitions/koussevitzky-international-recording-award-kira-winners|title=Koussevitzky International Recording Award (KIRA) Winners|last=User|first=Super|website=musiciansclubofny.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present day ==

The Musicians Club continues administering the Young Artist Awards, and in 2017 inaugurated the Dorothy Indenbaum Women Composers series. They also present an annual "Member-Composers Concert" that showcases works by current club members. Member-composers from recent years have included [[Leonard Lehrman]], [[:de:Mira J. Spektor|Mira Spektor]], and [[:de:Kermit Moore|Kermit Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members|url=http://musiciansclubofny.org/members|website=Musicians Club of New York|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Olympic Broadcasting Services''' ('''OBS''') is a company which was established by the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 2001 in order to serve as the Host Broadcaster organisation for all [[Olympic Games]], Olympic Winter Games and Youth Olympic Games, maintaining the standards of Olympic broadcasting between one edition and the next one.&lt;ref name=broadcasters&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.olympic.org/broadcasters |title=Broadcasters |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=International Olympic Committee |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Host Broadcaster, OBS is responsible for delivering the pictures and sounds of the Olympic Games to billions of viewers around the world. It produces and transmits unbiased live radio and television coverage of every sport from every venue. This feed is called the International Signal or the World Feed and is distributed as a service to all broadcast organisations who have purchased the television and radio rights to the Games (known as Rights Holding Broadcasters or RHBs).

In collaboration with the Local Organising Committee, OBS supervises the development of the necessary infrastructures (including the International Broadcast Centre or IBC which serves as the primary base of the broadcast operation for OBS and the RHBs during the Games) and facilities at the different Olympic venues to ensure the successful broadcast production of the Games. OBS also offers additional services, equipment and supplies to the RHBs to help them produce their unilateral production.

The [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing]] marked the first time OBS was involved as Host Broadcaster.&lt;ref name=obstv&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.obs.tv/fact_file.php?q=a2 |title=Fact File |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=Olympic Broadcasting Services |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the host broadcaster role was delegated to the local organising committees or to third-party broadcasters, having to rebuild the broadcast operation in each edition.&lt;ref name=broadcasters /&gt;

Its headquarters are in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=obstv /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/obs-madrid---olympic-host-broadcaster |title=OBS - OLYMPIC BROADCASTING SERVICES |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=Linkedin |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beijing 2008===
{{main|Beijing Olympic Broadcasting}}
Its operations began with the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], where [[Beijing Olympic Broadcasting]], a joint venture between OBS and the [[Beijing Organizing Committee]], acted as the host broadcasting consortium and the state television network, [[China Central Television]] which is one of the host nation broadcasters of the games.

===Vancouver 2010===
For the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], a wholly owned division, Olympic Broadcasting Services Vancouver was set up. The 2010 Olympics marked the first Games where the host broadcasting facilities were provided solely by OBS.

===London 2012===
The 2012 Olympic Games were broadcast by OBS. More than 5,600+ hours of live sports, ceremonies and Olympic News Channel content were distributed to the Rights Holding Broadcasters. OBS employed 1,000+ HD cameras, including 40 High Super Slow Motion cameras and other innovative specialty equipment such as 3D cameras, Super High Vision cameras and the world’s longest cablecam which stretched 2,340m at the Rowing venue from start to finish.

===Sochi 2014===
The Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games represented the largest broadcast operation in history for a Winter Games. OBS deployed more than 450 cameras, including 12 cablecam systems, 31 High Speed Slow Motion (HSSM) cameras and a multicopter/drone used for the first time, to ultimately produce 1300+ hours of television.

In total, 464 television channels broadcast the Sochi Games, almost double the number from Vancouver, and more digital platforms offered coverage than at any previous Winter Games with 155 websites and 75 apps showing events live from Russia.

Thanks to the increased number of channels and digital platforms for Sochi 2014, there were more hours broadcast globally than any previous Winter Games with more than 100,000 hours broadcast around the world, compared with 57,000 for Vancouver 2010.

For the first time in Olympic history, the amount of digital coverage exceeded traditional television broadcasts with 60,000 hours available on digital platforms, compared with 42,000 hours on television. These were the first predominantly digital Olympic Games and OBS helped fuel the significant increase in digital coverage by launching, for the first time in Sochi, the Olympic Video Player (OVP). Available in 95 countries, the OVP provided a fully integrated data, a news channel, live streams and on-demand video.

===Rio 2016===
Rio 2016 represented the most television coverage of any previous Olympic Games, with nearly 350,000 total hours broadcast globally, far exceeding the 200,000 hours that were broadcast for the London 2012 Games. Additionally, coverage was aired across more platforms than ever before, as more than 500 television channels and 250 digital outlets conveyed the Olympic Games around the world.

The number of hours of coverage available on digital platforms nearly doubled that of traditional television, representing more than two and a half times of what was achieved for London 2012 (218,000 hours versus 81,500 hours), marking a milestone in the history of Olympic broadcasting.

Representing the largest host broadcast operation to date, Rio involved more than 7,200 OBS personnel. Further, having developed a production plan to cover all 28 Olympic sports, including new additions Golf and Rugby Sevens, OBS drew on more than 1,000 cameras for the coverage of the Rio Games.

Rio also marked the first time Olympic content was available in Virtual Reality (VR). Overall, OBS produced more than 85 hours of live VR coverage, captured by custom-developed 360-degree camera systems, to a total of 14 RHB organisations, representing 31 territories.

OBS and Japanese Rights Holder NHK continued their collaboration on 4K/8K Super Hi-Vision (SHV) technology and produced approximately 100 hours of live coverage for Rio, featuring 22.2-channel surround sound.

In 2015, Phandeeyar hosted a two week event event called "MaePaySoe" (translating to "let's vote")&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hackers in programming meet to prepare for the vote|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/business/technology/16485-hackers-in-programming-meet-to-prepare-for-the-vote.html|website=The Myanmar Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where more than one hundred web developers gathered to create technology which informs the general public about potential political candidates in Myanmar and the country's voting process.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt;
===Seed Funding===
In 2016, around fifteen to twenty startups were projected to be accepted into the accelerator in a three year span.&lt;ref name="invest"/&gt; Phandeeyar also plans to invest around $2 million into startups in the near future. &lt;ref name=":100"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar: Phandeeyar sets up accelerator, to invest $200k in 8 startups in 2016 - DealStreetAsia|url=https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/phandeeyar-to-seed-fund-up-to-200000-through-their-first-tech-startup-accelerator-43871/|website=www.dealstreetasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the startups accepted, Phandeeyar would claim a 12 percent ownership of the companies. 
Those selected for Phandeeyar's 6 month training program would receive a funding of $25,000 to launch their ventures in addition to business partnerships to help with the early stages of their startups. &lt;ref name="invest"/&gt; These partnerships include leaders from regional companies such as the Myanmar Information Technology, CarsDB, [[Muru-D]]. and Golden Gate Ventures. &lt;ref name=":100"/&gt; Towards the end of the program, companies have the opportunity to pitch their startup ideas to [[venture capitalists]] and [[angel investors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Roundup (February 25)|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/business/business-roundup-february-25.html|website=The Irrawaddy|date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4320">The '''Pharmacy Act 1868''' was the major 19th-century legislation in the United Kingdom limiting the sale of poisons and [[dangerous drug]]s to qualified [[pharmacist]]s and druggists.

==Background==
During the 1850s and 1860s there were  moves to establish the medical and pharmaceutical professions as separate, self-regulating bodies. The [[Pharmaceutical Society]] had been established in 1841 and by the 1850s had 2,500 members out of a total of 25,000 drug sellers. The [[Pharmacy Act 1852]] set up a register of pharmacists and limited the use of the title to people registered with the society, but proposals to give it exclusive rights were rejected. After the society opposed two Poison Bills in 1857 and 1859 that did not meet its criteria, a rival United Society of Chemists and Druggists was established in 1860 by pharmacists disgruntled with the lack of progress, and in 1863 the newly established [[General Medical Council]] unsuccessfully attempted to assert control over drug distribution.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation |title=Opium and the People, Opiate Use in Nineteenth-Century England |first1=Virginia |last1=Berridge |first2=Griffith |last2=Edwards |year=1981 |url=http://www.druglibrary.eu/library/books/opiumpeople/pharmact.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225190914/http://www.druglibrary.eu/library/books/opiumpeople/pharmact.html |archivedate=2013-12-25 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually a compromise was reached between the two competing pharmaceutical societies, from which emerged the 1868 Act.

==Scope==
The Pharmacy Act 1868 established a system of registration involving major and minor examinations controlled by the Pharmaceutical Society. It also controlled the distribution of fifteen named poisons in a two-part schedule. All poisons had to be entered in a Poison Register. Those in the first part, which included [[strychnine]], [[potassium cyanide]] and [[ergot]], could only be sold if the purchaser was known to the seller or to an intermediary known to both. All drugs had to be sold in containers with the seller's name and address. [[Arsenic]] had already been controlled by an [[Arsenic Act 1851|1851 Act]].

Drugs in the second schedule included [[opium]] and all preparations of opium or of [[Poppy (flower)|poppies]]. There was opposition from many chemists, who claimed the various forms of opium such as [[laudanum]] constituted a major part of their trade, so that early drafts omitted it entirely; it was only reintroduced later in the parliamentary process.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|title=Pharmacy Act 1868|publisher=Hansard|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/acts/pharmacy-act-1868|accessdate=18 June 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect==
There was an immediate fall in the death rate caused by opium from 6.4 per million population in 1868 to 4.5 in 1869. After a decade it had risen to over 5 and by the end of the century it was back at the 1868 level. Deaths among children under five dropped from 20.5 per million population between 1863 and 1867, to 12.7 per million in 1871, and further declined to between 6 and 7 per million in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berridge|Edwards|1981|loc=Ch. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the reservation of opium to professional control, general sales did continue to a limited extent and sales of preparations containing less than 1 per cent of opium were generally permitted. Customers who could afford medical attention and obtained their opium on prescription suffered little hindrance.

In contrast with legislation regulating other industries at the time, the ''Pharmacy Act'' neglected to restrict the profession to men only. As a result, 223 women were listed on the first compulsory register of pharmacists in 1869. Most were the wives, widows or daughters of male pharmacists and were already practicing in 1868. [[Alice Vickery]] became the first woman to qualify as a pharmacist under the new Act in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The School of Pharmacy, University of London: Medicines, Science and Society, 1842-2012|page=100-103|author=Briony Hudson and Maureen Boylan|publisher=Academic Press|year=2013|isbn=0124076904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political economy''' is the study of [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[trade]] and their relations with [[law]], [[Custom (law)|custom]] and [[government]]; and with the [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] of [[national income]] and [[Economic wealth|wealth]]. As a discipline, political economy  originated in [[Ethics|moral philosophy]], in the 18th century, to explore the administration of states' wealth, with "political" signifying the Greek word ''[[polity]]'' and "economy" signifying the Greek word "[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%96konomie okonomie]" (household management). The earliest works of political economy are usually attributed to the British scholars [[Adam Smith]], [[Thomas Malthus]], and [[David Ricardo]], although they were preceded by the work of the French [[physiocrats]], such as [[François Quesnay]] (1694–1774) and [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]] (1727–1781).&lt;ref name="Steiner 2003 p62"&gt;Steiner (2003), pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, the term "[[economics]]" gradually began to replace the term "political economy" with the rise of mathematical modelling coinciding with the publication of an influential textbook by [[Alfred Marshall]] in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Alfred. (1890) ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, [[William Stanley Jevons]], a proponent of mathematical methods applied to the subject, advocated economics for brevity and with the hope of the term becoming "the recognised name of a science".&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, W. Stanley. ''The Theory of Political Economy'', 1879, 2nd ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR14=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. xiv.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groenwegen"&gt;Groenwegen, Peter. (1987 [[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics|[2008]]]). "'political economy' and 'economics'", ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, pp. 905-06. [Pp.&amp;nbsp;904–07.]&lt;/ref&gt; Citation measurement metrics from [[Google Ngram Viewer]] indicate that use of the term "economics" began to overshadow "political economy" around roughly 1910, becoming the preferred term for the discipline by 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Robbins (2016) "Why we need political economy," ''Policy Options'', [http://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/january-2017/why-we-need-political-economy/]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the term "economics" usually refers to the narrow study of the economy absent other political and social considerations while the term "political economy" represents a distinct and competing approach.

Political economy, where it is not used as a synonym for economics, may refer to very different things. From an academic standpoint, the term may reference [[Marxian economics]], applied [[public choice]] approaches emanating from the [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago school]] and the [[Virginia school of political economy|Virginia school]]. In common parlance, "political economy" may simply refer to the advice given by economists to the government or public on general [[economic policy]] or on specific economic proposals developed by political scientists.&lt;ref name="Groenwegen"/&gt; A rapidly growing mainstream literature from the 1970s has expanded beyond the model of economic policy in which planners maximize utility of a representative individual toward examining how political forces affect the choice of [[Economic policy|economic policies]], especially as to [[Distribution (economics)|distributional]] conflicts and political institutions.&lt;ref name="Alesina"&gt;[[Alberto Alesina|Alesina, Alberto F.]] (2007:3) "Political Economy," ''NBER Reporter'', [http://www.nber.org/reporter/2007number3/2007number3.pdf pp. 1-5]. Abstract-linked-footnotes [http://www.nber.org/reporter/2007number3/ version.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is available as a stand-alone area of study in certain colleges and universities.

==Etymology==
Originally, political economy meant the study of the conditions under which production or consumption within limited parameters was organized in nation-states. In that way, political economy expanded the emphasis of economics, which comes from the Greek ''oikos'' (meaning "home") and ''nomos'' (meaning "law" or "order"). Political economy was thus meant to express the laws of production of wealth at the state level, just as economics was the ordering of the home. The phrase ''économie politique'' (translated in English as "political economy") first appeared in France in 1615 with the well-known book by [[Antoine de Montchrétien]], ''Traité de l’economie politique''. The French [[physiocrats]] were the first exponents of political economy, although the intellectual responses of [[Adam Smith]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Henry George]] and [[Karl Marx]] to the physiocrats generally receives much greater attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poec.athabascau.ca/what/|title=What is Political Economy?|website=Political Economy, Athabasca University|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first professorship in political economy was established in 1754 at the [[University of Naples Federico II]] in [[Kingdom of Naples|southern Italy]]. The Neapolitan philosopher [[Antonio Genovesi]] was the first tenured professor. In 1763, [[Joseph von Sonnenfels]] was appointed a Political Economy chair at the [[University of Vienna]], Austria. [[Thomas Malthus]], in 1805, became England's first professor of political economy, at the [[East India Company College]], Haileybury, [[Hertfordshire]]. In its contemporary meaning, political economy refers to different yet related approaches to studying economic and related behaviours, ranging from the combination of economics with other fields to the use of different, fundamental assumptions that challenge earlier economic assumptions:

Other important landmarks in the development of political economy include:

* [[New political economy]] which may treat economic ideologies as the phenomenon to explain, per the traditions of Marxian political economy. Thus, Charles S. Maier suggests that a political economy approach "interrogates economic doctrines to disclose their sociological and political premises.... in sum, [it] regards economic ideas and behavior not as frameworks for analysis, but as beliefs and actions that must themselves be explained".&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Charles S. (1987). ''In Search of Stability: Explorations in Historical Political Economy'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge,  pp.3–6. [http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1135479/?site_locale=en_GB Description] and scrollable [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nKOHoyAMnugC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false preview.]  Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach informs Andrew Gamble's ''The Free Economy and the Strong State'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 1988), and Colin Hay's ''The Political Economy of New Labour'' (Manchester University Press, 1999). It also informs much work published in ''New Political Economy'', an international journal founded by Sheffield University scholars in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;cf: Baker, David (2006). [http://davidlewisbaker.net/baker_political_economy_of_fascism "The political economy of fascism: Myth or reality, or myth and reality?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623033918/http://davidlewisbaker.net/baker_political_economy_of_fascism |date=2011-06-23 }}, ''New Political Economy'', 11(2), pp. 227–250.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International political economy]] (IPE) an interdisciplinary field comprising approaches to the actions of various actors. In the United States, these approaches are associated with the journal ''[[International Organization]]'', which in the 1970s became the leading journal of IPE under the editorship of [[Robert Keohane]], [[Peter J. Katzenstein]] and [[Stephen Krasner]]. They are also associated with the journal ''[[The Review of International Political Economy]]''. There also is a more critical school of IPE, inspired by thinkers such as [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Karl Polanyi]]; two major figures are [[Matthew Watson (political economist)|Matthew Watson]] and [[Robert W. Cox]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Benjamin J. "The transatlantic divide: Why are American and British IPE so different?", ''Review of International Political Economy'', Vol. 14, No. 2, May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of a political economy approach by anthropologists, sociologists, and geographers used in reference to the regimes of politics or economic values that emerge primarily at the level of states or regional governance, but also within smaller social groups and social networks. Because these regimes influence and are influenced by the organization of both social and economic capital, the analysis of dimensions lacking a standard economic value (e.g. the political economy of language, of gender, or of religion) often draws on concepts used in Marxian critiques of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capital]]. Such approaches expand on [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxian]] scholarship related to [[economic development|development]] and [[underdevelopment]] postulated by [[André Gunder Frank]] and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].
* [[Historian]]s have employed political economy to explore the ways in the past that persons and groups with common economic interests have used politics to effect changes beneficial to their interests.&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Drew R. "The Elusive Republic: Political Economy in Jeffersonian America", Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Political economy and law is a recent attempt within legal scholarship to engage explicitly with political economy literature. In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Legal realism|legal realists]] (e.g. [[Robert Lee Hale|Robert Hale]]) and intellectuals (e.g. [[John R. Commons|John Commons]]) engaged themes related to political economy. In the second half of the 20th century, lawyers associated with the Chicago School incorporated certain intellectual traditions from economics. However, since the crisis in 2007 legal scholars especially related to international law, have turned to more explicitly engage with the debates, methodology and various themes within political economy texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/dkennedy/publications/PoliticalEconomy.pdf|title = Law and the Political Economy of the World|last = Kennedy|first = David|date = 2013|journal = Leiden Journal of International Law|doi = |pmid = |access-date = December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Research Handbook on Political Economy and Law|last = Haskell|first = John D.|publisher = Edward Elgar|year = 2015|isbn = 978 1 78100 534 7|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Piketty]]'s approach and call to action which advocated for the re-introduction of political consideration and political science knowledge more generally into the discipline of economics as a way of improving the robustness of the discipline and remedying its shortcomings, which had become clear following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Capital in the Twenty-First Century,'' [[Harvard University Press]]'', 2014, {{ISBN|978-0674430006}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related disciplines==
Because political economy is not a unified discipline, there are studies using the term that overlap in subject matter, but have radically different perspectives:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-economy|title=political economy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Politics]] studies power relations and their relationship to achieving desired ends
* [[Philosophy]] rigorously assesses and studies a set of beliefs and their applicability to reality
* [[Economics]] studies the distribution of resources so that the material wants of a society are satisfied; enhance societal well-being
* [[Sociology]] studies the effects of persons' involvement in society as members of groups and how that changes their ability to function. Many sociologists start from a perspective of production-determining relation from [[Karl Marx]]. Marx's theories on the subject of political economy are contained in his book  ''[[Das Kapital]]''.
* [[Political Economy in anthropology|Anthropology]] studies political economy by investigating regimes of political and economic value that condition tacit aspects of sociocultural practices (e.g. the pejorative use of [[Mock Spanish|pseudo-Spanish]] expressions in the U.S. entertainment media) by means of broader historical, political and sociological processes. Analyses of structural features of transnational processes focus on the interactions between the world capitalist system and local cultures.
* [[Archaeology]] attempts to reconstruct past political economies by examining the material evidence for administrative strategies to control and mobilize resources.&lt;ref&gt;Hirth, Kenneth G. 1996. Political Economy and Archaeology: Perspectives on Exchange and Production. ''Journal of Archaeological Research'', 4(3):203-239.&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence may include architecture, animal remains, evidence for craft workshops, evidence for feasting and ritual, evidence for the import or export of prestige goods, or evidence for food storage.
* [[Psychology]] is the fulcrum on which political economy exerts its force in studying decision making (not only in prices), but as the field of study whose assumptions model political economy.
* [[History]] documents change, often using it to argue political economy; some historical works take political economy as the narrative's frame.
* [[Ecology]] deals with political economy because human activity has the greatest effect upon the environment, its central concern being the environment's suitability for human activity. The ecological effects of economic activity spur research upon changing market economy incentives. Additionally and more recently, ecological theory has been used to examine economic systems as similar systems of interacting species (e.g., firms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=May|first1=Robert M.|last2=Levin|first2=Simon A.|last3=Sugihara|first3=George|title=Ecology for bankers|journal=Nature|date=February 21, 2008|issue=451|page=893-895|doi=10.1038/451893a|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/451893a|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
'''''Seishitsu''''' (正室) is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term of the [[Edo period]] for the official [[wife]] of high-ranking persons. The [[Emperor of Japan|tennō]], [[kugyō]] (court officials), ''[[shōgun]]'' and ''[[daimyō]]s'' often had several wives to ensure the birth of an heir. The ''seishitsu'' had a status above other wives, called ''sokushitsu'' (側室, [[Concubinage|concubine]]).

The system dates back to the [[ritsuryō]] system in the [[Nara period|Nara]] and [[Heian period]]s. At the time, the main wife was called ''chakusai'' (嫡妻). The last Japanese emperor to have official concubines was [[Emperor Meiji]].

Succession disputes between sons of the official wife and concubines were a constant source of internal, often armed conflict within houses ([[O-Ie Sōdō]]).

'''''Sexmission''''' ({{lang-pl|'''Seksmisja'''}}) is a 1984 [[Poland|Polish]] [[cult film|cult]] [[comedy]] [[science fiction]] [[action film]]. It also contains a hidden [[political satire]] layer specific to the time and place of its production.

==Plot==
In August 9, 1991, Maksymilian "Max" Paradys ([[Jerzy Stuhr]]), trying to find an adventure, and Albert Starski ([[Olgierd Łukaszewicz]]), biologist,  volunteer themselves for the first human [[hibernation]] experiment, created by professor Wiktor Kuppelweiser, a [[Nobel Prize]] laureate, who previously successfully hibernated a [[chimpanzee]] for half a year. Experiment is considered as an epochal event and is broadcast by television. Process of the hibernation is scheduled for 3 years.

Instead of being awakened 3 years later as planned, they wake up in the year 2044, in a [[Post-apocalyptic science fiction|post-nuclear]] world, both are 86 years old. When they wake up, they believe at first that they are in a clinic following their hibernation. They are being taken care of by women, which they enjoy at the beginning, especially Max, who becomes attracted to Lamia Reno. However they gradually realize that everything going on around them is odd. After explicitly asking to meet professor Kuppelweiser, they are informed by Lamia and Dr. Berna that he's dead as there was a war long ago, that all males have long been [[Extinction|extinct]], and that it is actually March 8th, 2044 ([[International Women's Day|Women's Day]]). Max and Albert think that these must be hallucinations as a side-effect of hibernation and try to leave the room, but receive an electric shock from the closed door. The men are under constant surveillance after this. Lamia informs them their society reproduces without males through [[parthenogenesis]]. During a briefing, Max kisses Lamia, for which she knocks him down and threatens both men with [[euthanasia]] if there is another attempt at sexual assault. However, the kiss causes Lamia's drug-inhibited passions to resurface, making her both confused and fascinated. Due to her internal feelings she goes on a search for the oldest living woman to find out anything about the men before the war. She finds 74-year old Julia Novack, who fondly remembers her fiancé and tells Lamia that the old world with two sexes should be restored. She also guesses that Lamia fell in love with one of man.

After several days, Max and Albert are permitted to go out to meet with Her Excellency, the supreme ruler of women. Waiting for her in the bio-sanctuary, they spot a tree with two tiny apples and eat them, being disgusted by synthetic food. At the meeting they ask what womankind did to mankind. The women reply it is not their fault, but Kuppelweiser's, who during the war invented an agent - the so-called M bomb - which was supposed to temporarily paralyze male genes, but due to an oversight wiped out male genes permanently. Max offers a proposal: he and Albert will serve as reproducers to restore the male population. But the women do not wish the old order to come back; Her Excellency points at the "sacred [[Apple|apple tree]]" and says it was planted by [[Mother goddess|Arch Mother]], and from which, when once in [[paradise]], a male [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|took an apple]] and seduced a woman by it, for which act all lost paradise forever. After noticing the missing sacred apples, Her Excellency becomes desperate and enraged and demands the men be taken back to their previous confinement and not be released anywhere. 

Once again confined, the men grow distressed and plan to escape by damaging the electric power grid. They succeed but are caught during a course organized by the special section how to act with men if they would ever return to the world, and locked up again. The women provide them with their last chance: to submit themselves for "naturalization" - undergoing a [[sex reassignment surgery]]. When they refuse, a ceiling above the room opens, showing a huge assembly of women, which has to determine their fate. Albert and Max now face a humiliating trial while the women blame males for oppression, virtually all evil and vices, and praise their new society. They engage in historical revisionism in claiming that the greatest scientists - such as [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] or [[Gregory Goodwin Pincus|Pincus]] (one of the pioneers of [[parthenogenesis]]) - were, in fact, women. When Max and Albert are taken away, the assembly is to choose between forced 'naturalization' (proposed by group "Archeo") and 'liquidation' (proposed by group "Genetix") of men. The first option is passed by a margin of only one vote. In the meantime, the men escape again. Wandering through what Albert calls "a nightmarish skyscraper", they encounter other women, who have known no man, and therefore see Max and Albert as their "sisters", provoking humorous encounters. After that the men discover a boot lying on the floor, with a bottle of [[Jabol|cheap wine]] (in real popular in Poland in late 20th century) and newspaper from 1993 with real history of the world from begin of the world war inside. Next they have to run away and discover the nest of "decadency" - one of the [[Anarchism|anarchist]], "[[hippie]]" women's groups, who do not wish to be part of the oppressive regime, play loud music, and some engage in [[Lesbian|lesbian relations]]. Max and Albert are caught as supposed government spies by them. In the meantime, the pursuing regime forces attack, and subsequent chaos provides the men with an opportunity to escape. During escape, they found After escaping, the men stumble upon Lamia, who provides them with a way to see the outside - a periscope - and reveals that they live deep underground in expanded old mines. The periscope shows a dark, rocky landscape above ground, and sensors indicate high levels of "Kuppelweiser [[radiation]]", a side effect of M bomb. However it turns out that Lamia's plan was a plot to catch the men and force them into surgery as Lamia was loyal for her group "Archeo". Lamia is congratulated by Tekla and Emma Dax (members of "Genetix") for her ingenious plan, but they also inform her that their section will now be in charge of the males, which devastates Lamia.

In the hands of Tekla, the fate of the males is to be different. Their organs will be extracted for [[Organ transplantation|transplantation]], and the remains will be tested for possible use of dead bodies for consumption due to a growing [[protein]] shortage. The chief surgeon, Dr Yanda, an old lady, is revealed to be Max's daughter, who now delights in taking revenge for his abandonment of his wife and child in favor of hibernation for his own profit. Lamia sabotages the surgery and helps the men escape as revenge for Tekla and Dax taking the men and her research. Shortly after escape Albert falls asleep in the lift and is dreaming that he's in 1994, when process of hibernation has successfully finished. In the periscope room Lamia threatens the guards by telling them that she will blast the whole block if they do not give her the code activating a capsule reaching the surface, while Max and Albert find and change into protective suits. The guards claim that only Her Excellency knows the password required; enraged, Max shouts "kurwa mać!" (a common strong Polish swear), and to the surprise of all present, the capsule is activated. Lamia changes into another protective suit and joins the men. While they explore the surface, Max suddenly bumps against an invisible barrier and is unable to go further. He takes a knife and cuts the fabric of the barrier, and a dazzling light appears. They all go through the hole and see a beach, with the periscope area being surrounded by a small circular structure. They then travel to a forest, but the suits are running out of [[oxygen]]. Suddenly Max shouts with joy and throws away his suit, seeing a flying [[stork]] and declares "if it can live, it means we can live too". After removing the suits, they find a cosy villa full of fresh food. While eating in the garden, they are found by Emma, who has been following them and, armed with a harpoon, demands their surrender, but she faints due to lack of oxygen. When she regains consciousness, Emma begins to fight with Albert; during their tussle, they accidentally turn on a TV and see an official government version of the events, including Lamia and Emma considered to death and an interview with "naturalised" Max and Albert, who claim to be feeling very well and thankful. Emma is shocked, unable to understand such lies and all the strange environment "with too much air". Max goes with Lamia to a bedroom and tries to explain her what [[mating]] is, while Albert tries his luck with Emma.

Later, while resting in the living room, Max and Albert suddenly hear the familiar, distressing sound of an arriving underground lift and hide. It is 'Her Excellency' who leaves the lift (covered in a locker) to feed 'her' caged birds. When 'she' opens a wardrobe, 'she' is attacked by Max, who has hidden in it. During the ensuing fight, 'her' breasts and hair are stripped, revealing that 'she' is a male in disguise, to 'her' panic and Max's disgust and rage. Max also removes an electronic necklace, which was converting 'Her Excellency's voice into one that sounds like a woman's. 'Her Excellency' tells the men his life story - just after the war, when the League of Women took power, he was 4 years old; the few boys remaining were naturalised into 'girls', but he was hidden by his mother. Growing up in a female disguise, he joined the League and finally was appointed as 'Her Excellency'. He was too afraid of the women to form a relationship with any and, revealing himself, to try to return to the old order. The government has been exaggerating the radiation level in order to keep the inhabitants underground, making them easier to control; likewise, the inhabitants are medicated to remove sexual desire. The three make a deal: Max and Albert will not compromise 'Her' Excellency's true identity, but they can stay in his home with Lamia and Emma. Later, Max and Albert, disguised as laboratory workers, put male [[gametes]] into the incubation center. Flashing forward to several months later, a nurse, routinely wrapping newborns in blankets, is horrified to see a penis.

==Political and social satire==
The film contains numerous subtle [[allusion]]s to the realities of the [[Eastern Bloc|communist-bloc]] society, particularly to that of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] just before the [[fall of communism]], perhaps in the anticipation of the major events to come; the fall of communism and the rise of political liberty.&lt;!--The example given below is of an alleged "allusion" to events that occurred after the film was made, not to any "reality of the communist-bloc society" at the time.--&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} When Max and Albert escape, they jump through the wall, which then starts to shake (often associated with later [[Lech Wałęsa]]'s jumping over the wall of the [[Gdańsk]] shipyard, and also with the subsequent fall of the [[Berlin wall]]). The secret meeting of the Women League apparatchiks and their lies to the women parallels the communist government of Poland. This dimension of the movie appears to typically escape the viewer more removed from the context. Some sections of this kind were left out from the version shown in Polish theaters by the government censors,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} but many passed through.

The movie can also be viewed as a satire directed at intergender conflict (wrong-headed [[feminism]] or wrong-headed  [[masculism]]), [[prudery]], or [[totalitarianism]].

==Reception==
In a contemporary review, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that the film was "not up to the standards of those quality Polish pics of the late 1970s [...] nonetheless the best pic to emerge form the Warsaw studios over the past season."{{sfn|Willis|1985|p=452|ps=: "Review is from August 1, 1984"}}

The film has been very popular in Poland. It was proclaimed to be the best Polish film of the last 30 years in a 2005 joint poll by readers of three popular film magazines.&lt;ref name="pol"&gt;[http://www.stopklatka.pl/wydarzenia/wydarzenie.asp?wi=27292 "The Best Polish Film of the Last 30 Years" (results of the poll by "Cinema", "Esensja" and "Stopklatka.pl") (in Polish)"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this assessment by the audience was considered to be a surprise as it disagreed with the historical rankings of Polish movies by the professional film critics.&lt;ref name="pol"/&gt; It received the ''[[Złota Kaczka]]'' award for the best Polish movie of 1984. The movie was also fairly popular in Hungary when shown a couple of years later.

They may be on [[Intimate relationship|intimate terms]] (in which case they are often referred to as "lovers") or [[Anonymity|anonymous]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebody.com/content/art32205.html Anonymous Sex - The Body&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as in the case of sex with a stranger, a [[one-night stand]], or a [[prostitute]]. A person can be another person's sexual partner even if the sexual activity is illegal, socially taboo, or otherwise [[Infidelity|in breach of a trust or commitment]]. A person may have more than one sexual partner at any one time, either as [[polyamory]], [[polygamy]] or in contravention of convention.

The term ''sexual partner'' is usually applied to consensual sexual relations, not to those that are forced or result from duress, as in the case of [[rape]]. In those cases, one party is typically called the perpetrator, and the person against whom the sex act is imposed is called a victim, or by similar terminology.

&lt;!--[Too many quotemarks / Needs to distinguish between consensual/non-consensual?:]--&gt;A sexual partner may or may not have equal power during a sexual activity; such sexual "roles" (which can sometimes be determined by [[personality type]] but can also be determined by a conscious choice by the individual to "assume" a particular "role") typically fall under [[Dominance and submission|various dominance/submission (D/s) categories]].

==Terminology==
Generally, a sexual partner is one with whom one is engaging in a sexual activity.

An ex-sexual partner is a person with whom the other partner does not intend to engage in any further sexual activity; while a prospective sexual partner is one with whom the person has not previously engaged in any sexual activity, but desires.

In the Hindu epic [[Ramayana]], '''''Sugriva''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: सुग्रीव, [[IAST]]: sugrīva สุคฺรีว, lit. ''beautiful necked'') was younger brother of [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]], whom he succeeded as ruler of the [[vanara]] kingdom of [[Kishkindha]]. [[Rumā]] was his wife. He was son of [[Surya]], the Hindu deity of sun. As the king of vanara, Sugriva aided [[Rama]] in his quest to liberate his wife [[Sita]] from captivity at the hands of the [[Rakshasa]] king [[Ravana]]. This aid is referred to as [[Sugrivajne (Sugriva pledge)|Sugrivajne]].

He is also known as {{lang-jv|Sugriwa}}, {{RTGS|Su-khrip}}, {{lang-lo|Sugeep}}, {{lang-km|Sukhreeb}}, [[Creole language|Creole]]: ''Soogrim'', {{lang-lo|Sangkip}}, {{lang-ta|Cukkirivan}}, {{lang-my|Thugyeik}}, Sugreeva or Sugreev.

==The Story of Sugriva==

The story of Sugriva is part of [[Ramayana]] and in an abbreviated version, is also present in the [[Mahabharata]].

===Sugriva and Vali Have A Disagreement===

[[File:Rama Meets Sugreeva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Rama Meets Sugreeva]]

[[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] ruled the kingdom of [[Kishkindha]]; his subjects were the [[vanaras]]. [[Tara (Ramayana)|Tara]] was his wife. One day, a raging demon by the name of [[Maayaavi]] came to the gates of the capital and challenged Vali to a fight. Vali accepted the challenge, but when he sallied forth, the demon fled in terror into a deep cave. Vali entered the cave in pursuit of the demon, telling Sugriva to wait outside. When Vali did not return and upon hearing demonic shouts in the cave and seeing blood oozing from its mouth, Sugriva concluded that his brother had been killed. With a heavy heart, Sugriva rolled a boulder to seal the cave's opening, returned to Kishkindha and assumed kingship over the vanaras. Vali, however, ultimately prevailed in his combat with the demon and returned home. Seeing Sugriva acting as king, he concluded that his brother had betrayed him. Though Sugriva humbly attempted to explain himself, Vali would not listen. As a result, Sugriva was ostracized from the kingdom, Vali forcibly took Sugriva's wife [[Rumā]] and the brothers became bitter enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Ramayana of Valmiki, Book IV, Canto 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Sugriva then goes on to live on Rishyamukh as it is the only place on earth that Vali cannot tread on. Vali was previously cursed by Sage Matang and hence cannot lay a foot on this piece of land. Doing so would cause his death.

===Sugriva Makes An Alliance===

[[File:Rama and Lakshmana Meet Sugriva at Matanga’s Hermitage.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Rama and Lakshmana Meet Sugriva at Matanga's Hermitage]]

In exile, Sugriva made the acquaintance of [[Rama]], the [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], who was on a quest to rescue his wife [[Sita]] from the demon [[Ravana]], king of the [[Rakshasas]]. Rama promised Sugriva that he would kill Vali and would reinstate Sugriva as the king of the vanaras. Sugriva, in turn, promised to help Rama with his quest.&lt;ref&gt;Ramayana of Valmiki, Book IV, Canto 8, 10; Mahabharata, Book III: Varna Parva, Section 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rama Kills Valli and hands over the kingdom to sugriva

[[File:Killing of Vali Monkey.jpg|thumb|250px|Killing of Vali vanara]]

Together, Sugriva and Rama went to seek out Vali. While Rama stood back, Sugriva shouted a challenge and dared him to battle. The brothers rushed at each other, fighting with trees and stones, with fists, nails and teeth. They were evenly matched and indistinguishable to the observer, until Sugriva's counsellor [[Hanuman]] stepped forward and placed a garland of flowers around Sugriva's neck. It was then that Rama emerged with his bow and drove an arrow through Vali's heart. When Vali had expired, Sugriva reclaimed the vanara kingdom, took back his wife, [[Rumā]] and took over Vali's main wife, Tara, who became empress and her son by Vali, Angada, who became crown prince.&lt;ref&gt;Ramayana of Valmiki, Book IV, Canto 11 ff.; Mahabharata, Book III: Varna Parva, Section 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

==Sugriva's Fight With Lava &amp; Kusha==

[[File:Duel of Rawana and Sugreeva.jpg|thumb|250px|Sugriva fight with [[Ravana]]]]

On [[Lakshmana]]'s request and after Guru [[Vasistha]]'s approval, [[Rama]] plans to do [[Ashvamedha]] Yagya. At this auspicious occasion he calls Sugriva along with [[Angada]], Nala, Neela, [[Jambavantha]] and [[Hanuman]] to come to [[Ayodhya]]. Rama greets and hugs Sugriva, Jambavantha and others on their arrival to Ayodhya.

The Yagya horse was captured by [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]] brothers. In the Rama's army the news spreads that two muni kumara's has captured the Yagya's horse. Shatrughana walks and fights with Lava and he was defeated by Lava. Then Lakshamana comes and he was also defeated by Lava. Then [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] asks Rama to give him the permission to go to set horse free from both muni Kumara. Sugriva and Hanuman also request Rama to permit them to go along with Bharata in the battle. Lava and Kusha defeat Bharata and Sugriva and take Hanuman as a prisoner. Hanuman was the only one who knew that Lava and Kush were sons of his master &amp; Sita and thus allowed himself to be imprisoned by his master's sons.&lt;ref&gt;Valmiki Ramayana&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==

When Rama decided to depart from the world and took ''[[samadhi]]'' in the [[Saryu River]], Sugriva also retired from earth and went with his father [[Surya]].

==Jain Version==

{{main|Rama in Jainism}}
According to [[Jain texts]], Sugriva was a human being and he took [[Jain monasticism|Jain Diksha]] and attained [[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]] from [[Mangi-Tungi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nashik.nic.in/htmldocs/touristplaces.htm|title=Mangi Tungi Temple|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001202528/http://nashik.nic.in/htmldocs/touristplaces.htm|archivedate=1 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic and Folkloric Depictions of Sugriva==

'''Suzanne Lacy''' (born 1945) is an American artist, educator, and writer, professor at the USC Roski School of Art and Design. She has worked in a variety of media, including [[installation art|installation]], [[video art|video]], [[performance art|performance]], [[public art]], photography, and [[Artist's book|art books]], in which she focuses on "social themes and urban issues."&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://suzannelacy.com/ |title=Home |author=Suzanne Lacy |date= |work=Artist Resource Center |publisher=Suzanne Lacy |accessdate=2009-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She served in the education cabinet of [[Jerry Brown]], then mayor of [[Oakland, California]], and as arts commissioner for the city.&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="virginia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=4901 |title=Noted Artist, Author Suzanne Lacy to Give Talk at University of Virginia April 23 |author= |date=2008-04-14 |work=UVA Today |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=2009-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121215152026/http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=4901 |archivedate=2012-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She designed multiple educational programs beginning with her role as performance faculty at The Feminist Studio Workshop at The [[Woman's Building]] in Los Angeles. 

==Early life==
Lacy has been involved with feminism since the late 1960s. She attended California State University located in Fresno in 1969, taking up graduate studies in psychology. At this university, Lacy and fellow graduate student Faith Wilding established the first feminist consciousness-raising group on campus. This lead up to her attendance in Judy Chicago's Feminist Art Program during the Fall of 1970. The 1970s became a period where Suzanne Lacy continued to explore identities, women's bodies, and social conditions. 

== Performance art ==
The 1976 renovation of the Biltmore Hotel in [[Los Angeles]], California sparked Lacy's performance art piece, ''Inevitable Associations''. The marketing surrounding the old hotel's renovations paralleled the hotel to an old woman. Photographs showing the hotels' original structure stating "There May Be Life in the Old Girl Yet" forced Lacy to question the ways in which our society views older women. Throughout her career one can See Lacy's awareness and desire to rebuttal the invisibility of aging women (see performances ''Whisper, the Waves, the Wind'' (1984) and ''Crystal Quilt'' (1987).

The performance of ''Inevitable Associations'' took place over a span of two days in the lobby of the Biltmore Hotel. The first day of the performance featured a public makeover of Lacy. It took nearly three hours for a makeup artist to publicly turn Lacy into an old woman. As the makeover was occurring, collaborators passed out flyers and literature on the hotel renovation as well as information about cosmetic surgery. Throughout the performance old women dressed in all black began to slowly enter the lobby and take seats on the opposite side of Lacy. This went nearly unnoticed until the number of elderly women had grown so large that their presence became undeniable to all of those in the lobby. Once Lacy's makeover was complete the mass of older women silently dressed Lacy in black clothes. The second day of the performance featured three elderly women participants who sat in red chairs in the lobby and told stories about their lives after the age of 60 and the effects of aging to passerby's and any audience that formed.  Lacy's goal throughout the performance was to bring awareness to the invisibility women must struggle with as they age and no longer fit into society's standards of beauty. ''Inevitable Associations'' was a crucial point in Lacy's career as it was the first time in which Lacy took her performance to the public streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Felshin|first1=Nina|title=But is it Art?

In 1977, Lacy and collaborator [[Leslie Labowitz-Starus|Leslie Labowitz]] combined performance art with activism in ''[[Three Weeks in May]]''.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Turning Stereotypes Into Artistic Strengths  |author=Karen Rosenberg |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 28, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/arts/design/28toge.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event included a performance piece on the steps of [[Los Angeles City Hall]] and [[self-defense]] classes for women in an attempt to highlight and curb sexual violence against women.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; The artists updated a map with reports from the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], printing the word "rape" on spots on a map of the [[greater Los Angeles Area]].&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;David Ng (December 12, 2012), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-hammer-museum-three-weeks-suzanne-lacy-rape-20121212,0,2850208.story Hammer Museum acquires ''Three Weeks in May'' by Suzanne Lacy] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacy and Labowitz teamed up with Bia Lowe, and other artists, in 1977 to create, ''[[In Mourning and in Rage|In Mourning and In Rage]],'' a large-scale public protest performance.  It had been designed to challenge media coverage that sensationalized a rash of murders of women by the so-called [[Hillside Strangler]]; the tone of the press coverage seemed geared to heighten the climate of fear which reinforced the image of women as [[Victimisation|victims]].  The performance began when a group of exceptionally tall women, made taller by towering black headpieces, arrived at City Hall in a hearse, followed by a caravan of cars filled with women in black. The Performers debarked and formed a circle in front of the steps of City Hall, beneath a banner that read, ”''In memory of our sisters, women fight back''.”  The artist's designed the performance, action and imagery, specifically to captivate the interest of television news; and, in successfully achieving this network coverage, used the media to critique itself—which extended the impact of the art performance far beyond the usual feminist and/or art audience.&lt;ref name="Wolverton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolverton|first1=Terry|title=Insurgent Muse: Life and Art at The Woman's Building|date=2002|publisher=City Lights|location=San Francisco|page=100|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants from the Woman’s Building, the Rape Hotline Alliance, and City Council joined with the [[feminist]] community and families of the victims in creating a public ritual of rage as well as grief.
&lt;ref name="homepage" /&gt;
Lacy and Labowitz founded [https://www.againstviolence.art ARIADNE: A Social Art Network], a collaborative group to create community-based artwork and educational opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lacy|first1=Suzanne|title=In Mourning and In Rage (1977) Suzanne Lacy and Leslie Labowitz|url=http://www.suzannelacy.com/early-works/#/in-mourning-and-in-rage-1977/|website=suzannelacy.com|accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-seventies, Lacy curated the first exhibition of women's performance art at Womanspace Gallery at The Woman's Building. In 1981, she collaborated with [[Susan Hiller]] to curate the exhibition ''We'll Think of a Title When We Meet: Women Performance Artists from London and Los Angeles'' at [[Franklin Furnace Archive|Franklin Furnace]], a well-known alternative arts venue founded in 1976 by [[Martha Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaulke, Cheri and Laurel Klick|first=eds|title=Feminist Art Workers: A History|year=2012|publisher=OTIS College of Art and Design|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1468050646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacy produced many performances in various sites around the world, mostly focusing on race, class and gender equity. During the first two decades of the 2000s, she reworked earlier performances, including ''[[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]]'', based upon the venues and objectives. In 2012, she re-created the 1977 performance for the Getty Pacific Standard Time Performance Festival. ''Three Weeks in January'', was an anti-rape performance based on her landmark 1977 project; this time the map was installed prominently on the Los Angeles Police Department's main campus.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel, Jori. "[http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/14/entertainment/la-et-suzanne-lacy-20120114 Three Weeks of Rapes, 35 Years Later,]" January 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Los Angeles rape map from Three Weeks in May.jpg|thumb|Suzanne Lacy, 3 Weeks in May (1977) – Feminist Art/Performance Art]]
''Whisper, the Waves, the Wind'', created with Sharon Allen in 1984, was the culmination of the ''Whisper Project'', a yearlong series of events that highlighted the special needs of older women. "I'm interested in the mythology surrounding older women," Lacy responded when being interviewed about her work,"in how they are denuded of their power in our culture. I want to help them overcome the barriers set up by prejudice, by the accumulation of wealth and power. I want to reinfuse them with their power and realized how right and evocative the sea was as a setting. With all its cycles, I think people will get the feeling whether they understand it or not, that sense of continuity in matriarchal [[consciousness]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Welsh|first1=Anne Marie|title=Arts Writer|publisher=Union-Tribune Publishing Co.|date=March 25, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of the performance a procession of 154 ethnically-diverse older women (between the ages of 65 to 99) all dressed in white, moving slowly down a staircase to the vast beach below. They sat in groups of four, at white cloth-covered tables on two adjacent beaches at Children's Pool in [[La Jolla]]. Their animated conversations focused on pre-selected topics—their thoughts about the physical process of aging; preparing for death; loss; the women's movement; what advice they would give to younger women." The audience watched and listened from the cliffs high above the beach where they could hear a collage of the women’s voices piped through speakers, managed by sound composer [[Susan Stone]].&lt;ref name="Performance Art"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lacy|first1=Suzanne|title=Leaving Art|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London 2010|page=xxviii|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt; "From the whisper of women's voices on a beach to a shout of rage on the steps of City Hall, Suzanne Lacy's art is one of alchemy and exorcism, celebration and condemnation" wrote Margot Mifflin in her interview with Lacy about the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mifflin|first1=Margot|title=From A Whisper To A Shout, Suzanne Lacy Talks About Art As A Network for Women's Voices|journal=High Performance|volume=7|issue=26|pages=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Mother's Day]], May 10, 1987, Lacy directed the hour-long ''Crystal Quilt'', a sequel to ''Whisper, the Waves, the Wind''.  This time, however, the performance was staged indoors, in what is known as the "Crystal Court" (a space normally occupied by kiosks and a café) in the [[IDS Center]], a downtown [[Minneapolis]] skyscraper designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee. ''The Crystal Quilt'' was the most ambitions and most complex of all of Lacy's 1980's vivant, as she often describes these grand, large-scale productions.&lt;ref name="leaving art"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lacy|first1=Suzanne|title=Leaving Art|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London|pages=xxviiii - xxx|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Crystal Quilt'', which featured 430 older women.&lt;ref name="radical"&gt;{{cite book |title=Radical street performance: an international anthology |last=Cohen-Cruz |first=Jan |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1998 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-15231-3 |page=xx |pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pQAVRntIUJsC&amp;dq=%22suzanne+lacy%22+crystal+quilt&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate= 2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmed and broadcast live on [[PBS]], the performance involved "women talking about their lives as their gathering created an eighty-two foot square tableau in the shape of a quilt."&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vdb.org/smackn.acgi$tapedetail?MAKINGTHEC |title=Making the Crystal Quilt |author= |date= |work=vdb.org |publisher=Video Data Bank |accessdate=2009-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was attended by over 3,000 people.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Lacy believes that her work cannot be re-enacted literally based on its immediate response to specific times and places. However, as many issues remain current it is possible to "re-think" works in new contexts.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Like ''Crystal Quilt,'' ''Silver Action'' concerns older women, a re-creation produced for the opening of The Tanks performance space at [[Tate Modern]]. ''Silver Action'' took place in February 2013 at the Tate Modern Gallery in London and featured 400 women over the age of 60 discussing activism regarding women's rights: their past participation, the future, and how their views have changed as they matured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laura Barnett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jan/29/tate-modern-womens-liberation-army |title=Tate Modern's women's liberation army &amp;#124; Art and design |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1991 and 2001, Lacy staged ''The Oakland Projects'', a community performance art project, with TEAM (Teens, Educators, Artists, Media Makers) members. ''The Oakland Projects'' aimed to engage local California youth in consciousness-raising discussions about police brutality, social injustice, education, and other social issues.  Participants did not ‘perform’ in the traditional sense, but instead mirrored the social stereotypes that they see within in their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gogarty|first1=Larne Abse|title=Performance as a Rehearsal for Revolution: Suzanne Lacy’s Oakland Projects through the lens of the Paterson Strike Pageant|url=http://www.historicalmaterialism.org/conferences/8annual/submit/performance-as-a-rehearsal-for-revolution-suzanne-lacy2019s-oakland-projects-through-the-lens-of-the-paterson-strike-pageant|publisher=historicalmaterialism.org|accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Roof is On Fire'' (1993–1994) was a two-year project in which Lacy and collaborators developed media literacy classes for Oakland youth, and conducted a one-night performance piece. More than 200 young people had conversations in cars about race, class, gender, inequality, and other issues. Observers were asked to listen in on the conversations. The students trained in independent media created a documentary of the performance, which was covered on mainstream news stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suzannelacy.com/the-oakland-projects/ |title=The Oakland Projects (1991-2001) Б─■ SUZANNE LACY |publisher=Suzannelacy.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Lacy modified her earlier work ''Three Weeks in May'' (1977) for a new project called ''Three Weeks in January'', which continued the dialogue about rape in Los Angeles. It included presentations, conversations, and a performance called ''Storying Rape''. ''Storying Rape: Shame Ends Here'' grew into another art project produced for the Liverpool Biennial in 2012, which promoted a public conversation in the English city about rape violence, education, and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threeweeksinjanuary.org/ |title=Storying Rape |publisher=Threeweeksinjanuary.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, Lacy organised conversations among women on the stoops of Park Place houses in Brooklyn, New York, for her ''Between the Door and the Street'' Project. Sponsored by the [[Brooklyn Museum]]’s [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]], 360 participants discussed gender issues while passersbys listened in.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Kino (October 10, 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/arts/design/suzanne-lacy-and-hundreds-of-women-take-to-the-stoops.html?_r=0 When Talking Makes the Art Happen: Suzanne Lacy and Hundreds of Women Take to the Stoops] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
In 1977, Lacy  became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

== Writing ==
Lacy is the editor of ''Mapping the Terrain: New Genre Public Art'', an anthology of essays about the impact of performance art in public spaces.&lt;ref name="mapping"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mapping the terrain: new genre public art |last=Lacy |first=Suzanne |authorlink=Suzanne Lacy |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=Indiana University |location= |isbn=0-941920-30-5 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqDYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Mapping+the+Terrain:+New+Genre+Public+Art%22+lacy&amp;dq=%22Mapping+the+Terrain:+New+Genre+Public+Art%22+lacy&amp;client=firefox-a |accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katy Deepwell 'Suzanne Lacy: New Genre Public Art'  vol.4 July 1999 n.paradoxa: international feminist art journal pp.25-33&lt;/ref&gt; She has also written articles on performance art.&lt;ref name="bibliography"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/waaw/cohn/Artists/Lacybiblio.html |title=Suzanne Lacy - Bibliography |author= |date= |work=Nature, Culture, Public Space |publisher=Women Artists of the American West |accessdate=2009-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacy has consistently written about her work: planning, describing, and analyzing it; advocating socially engaged art practices; theorizing the relationship between art and social intervention; and questioning the boundaries separating high art from popular participation. By bringing together thirty texts that Lacy has written since 1974, Lacy's Book,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leaving Art: Writings on Performance, Politics, and Publics, 1974-2007&lt;/ref&gt; offers an intimate look at the development of feminist, conceptual, and performance art since those movements’ formative years. In the introduction, the art historian Moira Roth provides a helpful overview of Lacy’s art and writing, which in the afterword the cultural theorist Kerstin Mey situates in relation to contemporary public art practices.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Academia ==
Lacy has held several positions at academic institutions focusing on the arts. She was the Dean of Fine Arts at [[California College of the Arts]] (CCA) from 1987-1997.&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="otis"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://intranet.otis.edu/alumni/nl/2002-09.htm |title=Sept 2002 - Inter-networking |author= |date= |work=Otis Alumni Newsletter |publisher= |accessdate=2009-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacy was a founding faculty member at [[California State University, Monterey Bay]]&lt;ref name="otis"/&gt; and founding director of the Center for Fine Art and Public Life.&lt;ref name="otis"/&gt; She served as the Chair of Fine Arts at [[Otis College of Art and Design]] from 2002–2006, before designing and launching a [[Master of Fine Arts]] program in [[Social practice (art)|Public Practice]] for the college in 2007.&lt;ref name="otis2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ospace.otis.edu/publicpracticeportfolio/Suzanne_Lacy |title=Digification:: Graduate Public Practice Portfolio |author= |date= |work=Otis College of Art and Design |publisher=Digication, Inc |accessdate=2009-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018 she is professor of art at the USC Roski School of Art and Design of the University of Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://roski.usc.edu/community/faculty/suzanne-lacy|title=Suzanne Lacy {{!}} Roski School of Art and Design|website=roski.usc.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tariana''' (also '''Tariano''') is an [[endangered language|endangered]] [[Maipurean]] (also known as Arawak) language spoken along the [[Vaupés River]] in [[Amazonas State, Brazil|Amazonas]], [[Brazil]] by approximately 100 people. Another approximately 1,500 people in the upper and middle [[Vaupés River]] area identify themselves as ethnic Tariana but no longer speak the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brasil.antropos.org.uk/ethnic-profiles/%20profiles-t/167-268-tariano.html.|title=Tariana – Taliaseri|last=Phillips|first=David J|website=brasil.antropos.org.uk|language=pt-pt|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tariana people|Tariana]] and East [[Tucano people|Tucano]] peoples are linguistically [[exogamy|exogamous]] and consider fellow speakers of their languages blood relatives. Languages, like tribal identity, are acquired through [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] descent and as such are kept strictly separate from one another, with minimal [[lexical borrowing]] occurring among them.  Traditionally, Indians in the Vaupés region spoke between three and ten other languages, including their mother's tongue and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and/or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Speakers of Tariana have been switching to the unrelated [[Tucano language]] (of the [[Tucanoan]] family), which became a [[lingua franca]] in the Vaupés region in the late 19th century. Arriving in the region in the 1920s, Salesian missionaries promoted the exclusive use of Tucano among Indians in an effort to convert them. Economic concerns have also led fathers to increasingly leave their families to work for non-Amerindian Brazilians, which has undermined the patrilineal father-child interaction through which Tariana was traditionally acquired. In 1999, efforts were made to teach Tariana as a second language in the secondary school in Iauaretê.  Regular classes in Tariana have been offered at the school since 2003.&lt;ref name=Grammar&gt;Aikhenvald, Alexandra (2003). ''A Grammar of Tariana''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6–9}}

Research on Tariana, including a grammar book and a Tariana-Portuguese dictionary, has been done by [[Alexandra Aikhenvald]] from the [[La Trobe University]], a specialist on the [[Arawak languages|Arawak language family]].

==Phonology==
Tariana has a relatively large phoneme inventory, compared to other Vaupés languages such as [[Baniwa language|Baniwa]] and Tucano. It has a rare set of phonotactic restrictions that determine whether phonemes can occur initially or medially and in which types of morphemes. The phoneme {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, for example, can occur initially in roots but not in affixes or enclitics.

Bolded letters indicate the [[orthography]] used by Alexandra Aikhenvald in her ''Grammar of Tariana''. [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription is indicated if it differs from the standard orthography.

===Vowels===
Tariana has 6 vowels, all of which may occur nasalized, except for {{IPA|[ɨ]}}, or long, except for {{IPA|[ɨ]}} and {{IPA|[ɵ]}}.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''ɨ'' occurs only in the [[augmentative]] enclitic ''-pɨ'' and in the [[onomatopoeic]] ''ɨhmeni'' "moan". It also occasionally appears as an allophone of ''i'' in the following words: ''marawati''→''marawatɨ'' "a type of snuff", ''hitísi''→''hitɨsi'' "tear", and ''-pití''→''pitɨ'' "chase away, kick". Its occurrence in Tariana has been ascribed to the influence of [[Tucano language|Tucano]].&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|32–33}}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''õ'' occurs only in the following words: ''tõkẽ'' "firefly", ''siwirikõrena'' "tapiriri, Tapirira guianensis", ''nuitõ'' "daughter! ([[vocative]])", and -tõreta "roll into a thin roll, like a cigarette". It also occurs word-initially in place names of Tucano origin (e.g. Õrõreana).&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|33}}

The phoneme {{IPA|/ɡ/}} occurs only in loanwords from Portuguese (e.g. the names ''Graciliano'', ''Gabriel''). A tendency to insert a glottal stop {{IPA|/ʔ/}} after word-final {{IPA|/a/}} has been noted among younger speakers. That has been ascribed to the influence of [[Tucano language|Tucano]].&lt;br&gt;

===Syllable structure===
Syllables in Tariana follow the pattern (C₁)V(C₂). Phoneme occurrence is also restricted by morphological context, with certain phonemes only in certain positions (initially and medially) or within certain types of morphemes. Vowels may be elided or reduced in rapid speech, rendering some syllables VC or CVC. For example, the word ''di-dusitá'' 'he goes back' becomes [didusta] in rapid speech, with the elision of the [[tone (linguistics)|pre-tonic]] ''i''. Similarly, the word ''di-pitá-kà-sità'' 'he bathes' becomes [dipitakaəsta], with the pre-tonic ''i'' being elided and a {{IPA|[ə]}} inserted at the clitic boundary before the ''s''. (Hyphens mark affixes; equals signs mark clitics.)&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|34–35}}

===Stress===
Tariana has both primary and secondary [[stress (linguistics)|stress]].  Tariana is a [[pitch-accent]] language, with stressed syllables indicated by a higher pitch and a greater intensity in pronunciation. Unstressed syllables are undifferentiated from non-stressed syllables except in their intensity. Long vowels are always stressed as well as most nasal vowels. Otherwise, primary stress may fall on the last three syllables. Penultimate stress in most common in [[morpheme|monomorphemic]] words (e.g. ''dúpu'' "a lizard"), but antepenultimate (e.g. ''képira'' "bird") and final stress (e.g. ''yapuratú'' "long flute used at ritual offering") also occurs. All roots have underlying stress. Prefixes are unstressed, and suffixes may be stressed or unstressed. Suffixes with underlying stress generally cause penultimate stress when they are attached to a root (e.g. ''máwi'' "hook"→''mawípi'' "blowgun").&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|37–39}}

===Phonological processes===
'''Vowel Reduction'''&lt;br&gt;
In rapid speech, ''e'', ''i'', and ''a'' are [[vowel reduction|reduced]] to ''ə'' in pre- and post-tonic syllables. Pre-tonic reduction occurs in the third syllable before the primary stress (e.g. ''yarumakási→yərumamkási'' "clothing") as well as in word-initial syllables (e.g. ''yakóreka→yəkóreka'' "door"). Vowels are also reduced in syllables preceding a secondary stress (e.g. ''makhà→məkhà'' "recent past non-visual"). Post-tonic reduction affects word-final syllables (e.g. ''yásene→yásenə'' "the Tucano").&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''H-Metathesis'''&lt;br&gt;
H-[[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] occurs if an h-initial root or suffix follows a prefix or a root, respectively.  The process follows one of three patterns:
* CV- + ''h''VX → C''h''VX → CʰVX, if C is a stop, nasal, or bilabial glide.
:''di-'' '3sngnf' + ''-híma'' 'hear' → ''dhi-ima'' 'he hears'
If there are multiple CV syllables preceding the h-initial root or suffix if the C is a stop, nasal, or bilabial glide, the h metathesizes to the first of them.
:''ñamá'' 'two' + ''-hípa'' 'numeral classifier: human' → ''ñhamá-ipa'' 'two humans'
* V₁- + ''h''V₂X → ''h''V₁V₂X (→''h''V₂X if V₁-V₂)
:''i-'' '2pl' + ''-hípa'' 'grab' → ''hi-ipa'' → ''hípa'' 'you pl. grab'
* CV + V''wh''V → C''h''V''w''V → CʰV''w'', when C is a stop, nasal, or bilabial glide.
:''pá:'' 'one' + ''-iwhi'' 'classifier: thin particle-like things' → ''phéwi'' 'one thin particle-like thing'.

[[Vowel coalescence]] occurs, with the ''a''+''i'' resulting in an ''e'', but that occurs only in the case of h-metathesis and not elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|46–47}}

==Morphology==
Tariana is a [[polysynthetic language]], with both [[head-marking language|head-marking]] and [[dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]] elements. Verbs are differentiated by those which take prefixes: active transitive and intransitive, and those which do not: stative verbs and verbs which describe physical states. Nouns divide into those that can be possessed/prefixed and those that are prefixless. Adjectives in Tariana share a number of features with Nouns and Verbs -  the majority of affixes used are the same as those of nouns.&lt;ref name="Grammar" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:66-83&lt;/sup&gt; The -O suffix has generally been lost in Tariana, while the -nuku [[dependent-marking]] suffix has been gained. In any non-subject function, this suffix may be added to a noun. There is evidence that dependent markers have been gained via local diffusion, as all [[Tucanoan languages|Tucano language]] in the area utilize dependent markers. Overall, dependent markers seem to have been gained in response to the loss of half of the [[head-marking language|head-markings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixon|first1=R.M.W.|title=The rise and fall of languages|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521626545|pages=122–123|edition=Reprint., transferred to digital print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nouns===
Nominal words may include up to 16 structural positions, which are defined as follows (hyphens mark affixes; equals signs marks clitics):&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|83}}

====Pronouns====
Tariana uses an Arawak's common set of prefixes to mark A/Sₐ on its verbs and pronominal possession on possessed nouns. These prefixes also form independent personal pronouns when combined with the emphatic particle -ha-.&lt;ref name="Grammar" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:122&lt;/sup&gt;

'''The Indefinite Prefix'''

This is a nominal morphological aspect shared with Baniwa of Içana and Baré, two of Tariana’s Arawak sisters. This prefix uniquely permits these languages in signifying that the subject/possessor is unknown. However, the prefix appears primarily linked to nouns in Tariana, wherein the others it applies to both nouns and verbs.

===Verbs===
Predicates in Tariana may include up to nine affixes, which are defined as follows:&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|253–254}}
* Cross-referencing prefixes or negative ''ma-'' or relative ''ka-''
* [[Root (linguistics)|Root]]
* Thematic syllable
* [[Causative]] ''-i, -ita''
* [[negation (linguistics)|Negative]] ''-(ka)de''
* [[reciprocal (grammar)|Reciprocal]] ''-kaka''
* ''-ina'' 'almost, a little bit'
* Topic-advancing ''-ni'', or [[passive voice|passive]] ''-kana'', or purposive non-visual ''-hyu'' or purposive visual ''-karu''
* Verbal classifiers
* [[Benefactive]] ''-pena''
Suffixes may be followed by a number of enclitics, as follows (note that ! marks a floating clitic):
* Intentional, 'be about to' ''-kasu''
* [[Mood (linguistics)|Mood]] ([[imperative mood|imperative]], [[declarative sentence|declarative]], frustrative ''-tha'', [[conditional mood|conditional]] ''-buhta'', apprehensive -''da/-nhia'', [[interrogative]] fused with [[evidentiality]] and tense)
* [[Aspect (linguistics)|Aspect]] 'zone' I, includes habitual prescribed ''-hyuna'' 'what you do and what you ought to do'', customary ''-kape'', habitual repetitive ''-nipe'', anterior ''-nhi''
* a/b ! Evidentiality and tense (e.g. ''-mha-na'' 'non-visual-remote.past')
* Epistemic ''-da'' 'doubt', ''-pada'' 'isn't it true that'
* Aktionsart (manner or extent of associated action, e.g. 'split open', 'step on and feel pain', 'away')
* ! Degree: augmentative 'indeed', diminutive, approximative, excessive
* Aspect 'zone' II, includes prolonged/ongoing ''-daka'' 'yet, still', [[perfective]] ''-sita'' 'already accomplished', ! repetitive ''-pita, -ta'' 'once again', ! completive ''-niki'' 'totally, completely'
* [[Switch reference]] and clause-chaining
* ! Emphatic enclitics ''a/ya, wani''; evidence ''sõ''
The following verb construction includes 11 of the 20 possible structural positions:&lt;br&gt;

:NEG-break-CAUS1-CAUS2-NEG-REC-FRUST-REMP.P.INFR-SPLIT.OPEN-COML-SUB
:"While (they) apparently did not break each other by splitting open totally in vain..."

===Tense-evidentiality===
Tariana has a system of obligatory [[grammatical tense|tense]]-[[evidentiality]] markers, which take the form of [[clitic]]s on verbs. There are four tenses: present, recent past, remote past, and future. In affirmative clauses, non-future tenses fuse with evidentials to designate visual, non-visual, inferred generic, inferred specific, and reported information. The inferred specific evidential is a recent innovation and has been ascribed to the influence of Tucano. It is a combination of the anterior aspect marker ''-nhi'' and non-present visual evidentials ''-ka'' and ''-na'' producing ''-nhika'' for recent past inferred specific and ''-nhina'' for remote past inferred specific.&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|287–289}}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

| align=center | ''-pidana''
|-
|}
In [[interrogative]] clauses, the same three non-future tenses fuse with evidentials to designate visual, non-visual, and inferred information.  Evidentiality, in interrogative clauses, indicates the speaker's assumptions about the addressee's source of information. Use of an inferred evidential, for example, implies that the speaker assumes the addressee not to have direct access to evidence on the subject at hand.&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|311–317}} Note the remote past non-visual is rarely used except as a "conventionalized conversation sustainer," an interrogative repetition of a storyteller's predicates to indicate listeners' attention.&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|319}}

There are two future tense markers in Tariana, neither of which indicates evidentiality. The definite future marker ''-de'' is used only in the first person, but the indefinite future marker ''-mahde'' may be used for any person.&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|320–321}}

==Syntax==

===Word order===
[[Word order]] in Tariana is "pragmatically based" and is generally free except for a handful of specific contexts:&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|561}}
* [[Complement (linguistics)|Complements]] of the positive [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''alia'' must precede the copula.
* Interrogative words typically occur clause-initially.
* Clause and sentence connectors occur sentence-initially.
* Predicates occur clause-finally in dependent clauses.
* Subjects of imperative and apprehensive constructions follow the verb.
* In "double S-clauses," "References to emotional states and contain an inalienably possessed body part," the body part must precede the predicate.&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|568–571}}
:''du-kare du-wara-ka''
:3sgf-heart 3sgnf-diminish-REC.P.VIS
:"She is worried (lit. she diminished with respect to her heart)."&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|500}}

===Noun phrases===
Noun phrases comprise a head, which may be a noun, adjective, demonstrative, specifier article, quantifier, or deictic as well as one or more modifiers. Modifiers must agree with the head in animacy and in number if the head is animate. Specifier articles, demonstratives, and the quantifier ''kanapada'' 'how many, how much; this many, this much' always precede the head. All other modifiers may either precede or follow the head. In general, modifiers precede a definite or topical noun and follow an "indefinite, non-specific, or otherwise inconsequential nominal referent."&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|476}}&lt;br&gt;
:''ne ma:tʃite hema-yana di-swa-nhi-na''
:then bad+NCL:ANIM tapir-PEJ 3sgnf-lie-ANT-REM.P.VIS
:"Then a naughty (well-known) bad tapir was lying (there)."
Even though the noun 'tapir' has just been introduced, the fact that the adjective 'bad' precedes it indicates that it is well-known or topical.

===Case===
Tariana exhibits an essentially [[nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] [[morphosyntactic alignment]]. Its core cases are broadly analyzed as falling into the categories of A/S 'subject' and non-A/S 'non-subject'.

A stands for a transitive subject, S for a subject of an intransitive verb, S for a subject of an active intransitive verb, Sₒfor a subject of a stative intransitive verb, and S for a subject of an intransitive verb with a non-canonically marked argument.

[[Case-marking]] is determined by the discourse status of the noun ([[topic (linguistics)|topical]], [[topic (linguistics)|non-topical]], [[focus (linguistics)|focused]]).

|}
A noun in the A/S /Sₒcategory is considered focused if it meets one of the following conditions:
* A/Sₐ/S is a key participant in contrastive focus to another argument.
* A/Sₐ/Sₒis presented as a main participant in the discourse or is a newly introduced but already-known participant important for future discourse.
* A/Sₐ/Sₒmust be disambiguated.&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|141–142}}
A noun in the non-A/Sₐ/Sₒis considered topical if it meets one of the following conditions:
* The noun is or will be the topic of the narrative.
* The noun is referential, specific, and/or definite.
* The noun is important but not necessarily contrastive.&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|145}}

Tariana has two [[oblique case|oblique]] cases: the [[locative case|locational]] and the [[instrumental case|instrumental]]/[[comitative case|comitative]], but only nouns may be marked for bot. Pronouns are marked only for the instrumental/comitative.

|-
|}

Because oblique cases are inherently non-A/Sₐ/S, they may be double-marked if they serve as the topic of the sentence as well. The following example is from a hunter's narrative about improving his house, with 'house' being the topic of the narrative. Note that in this sentence, 'house' is marked both as a topical non-A/Sₐ/S and locational.&lt;br&gt;

Tariana [[switch reference]] [[enclitics]] indicate whether the action of a dependent clause is simultaneous with or prior to the action of the main clause and whether the subject of the dependent clause is the same or different from the subject of the main clause. In rapid speech, the enclitic ''-hyume'' often becomes ''-yuhme'' or even ''-yume''. ''-Kayami'' can be ponounced ''-kañami'' or ''-kayãmi''. Note that there are several different enclitics for simultaneous action categories.  Each enclitic has various restrictions as to which other clitics and affixes with which it may combine and where it may fall within a clause or sentence.&lt;ref name=Grammar/&gt;{{rp|516–525}}

'''''The Strong Breed''''' is one of the best known plays by [[Wole Soyinka]]. It is a [[tragedy]] that ends with an individual sacrifice for the sake of the communal benefit. The play is centered on the tradition of [[egungun]], a Yoruba festival tradition in which a scapegoat of the village carries out the evil of the community and is exiled from the civilization. Eman, the play's [[protagonist]], takes on the role of "carrier", knowing it will result in beating and exile. He does this to spare a young simpleton the same fate. The ritual takes an unexpected turn as Eman flees. His pursuers set a trap for him that results in his death.

The play was first published in [[London]] in 1964 by [[Oxford University Press]], and subsequently by [[Rex Collings]] in 1971.

The '''Udeep tribe''' of [[India]] represent about 300 families living in northern India.  Based solely in the [[Himachal Pradesh]] of northern India, the Udeep(s) live in two different towns each controlled by a separate clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://himachaltourism.gov.in/HimachalIT/Page/History.aspx |title= History of Himachal Pradesh|publisher= Himachal Tourism |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Junkow is the home to the Kulkarni clan while the Chhattispur clan manages the town of Aokini. The Udeep represent some of the last vestiges of [[Jainism]] remaining in that region of India and its essence is concern for the welfare of every being in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/ataglance/glance.shtml|title= Religions: Jainism at a glance|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A people of [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] descent, when they emigrated out southern India aways from the rest of the Dravidians is unclear but the migration appears to have happened in the mid 13th century after they sided with the invading [[Mongols]] and were driven out of the Southern Peninsula.

A dialect is a territorial, professional or social variant of a standard literary language.

In the [[Ukrainian language]] there are 3 major dialectical groups according to territory: the south-western group, the south-eastern group and the northern group of dialects.

== South-western group ==

|-
|Volynian
|spoken in [[Rivne Oblast|Rivne]] and [[Volyn Oblast|Volyn]], as well as in parts of [[Zhytomyr Oblast|Zhytomyr]] and [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]]. It is also used in [[Chełm]] in [[Poland]].
|-
|Upper Dniestrian
|considered to be the main Galician dialect, spoken in the [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]], [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] and [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Ivano-Frankivsk]] Oblasts. Its distinguishing characteristics are the influence of Polish and the German vocabulary, which is reminiscent of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] rule.
|-
|Pokuttia (Bukovynian)
|spoken in the [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] of Ukraine. This dialect has some distinct vocabulary borrowed from [[Romanian Language|Romanian]]. 
|-
|Hutsul
|spoken by the [[Hutsuls|Hutsul people]] on the northern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains, in the extreme southern parts of the [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]], as well as in parts of the [[Chernivtsi Oblast|Chernivtsi]] and [[Transcarpathian Oblast|Transcarpathian]] Oblasts. &lt;!--Destinctive Features--&gt;
|-
|Boyko
|spoken by the [[Boyko|Boyko people]] on the northern side of the Carpathian Mountains in the [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]] and [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Ivano-Frankivsk]] Oblasts. It can also be heard across the border in the [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship]] of Poland. &lt;!--Destinctive Features--&gt;
|-
|Lemko
|spoken by the [[Lemkos|Lemko people]], most of whose [[Lemkivshchyna|homeland]] rests outside the current political borders of Ukraine in the [[Prešov Region]] of [[Slovakia]] along the southern side of the Carpathian Mountains, and in the southeast of modern Poland, along the northern sides of the Carpathians.&lt;!--Destinctive Features--&gt;
|-
|[[Rusyn language|Rusyn]]
|spoken by the [[Rusyns|Rusyn people]], who live in Transcarpathia around [[Uzhhorod]]. It is similar to the Lemko dialect but differs from them by the active use of Russian and Hungarian elements. There is an active movement to make this dialect a separate language distinct from Ukrainian.&lt;!--Destinctive Features--&gt;

Thus, there is no linguistic border between Russian and Ukrainian, and thus, both grammar sets can be applied. This dialect is considered a transitional dialect between Ukrainian and Russian.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.ethnology.ru/doc/narod/t1/gif/nrd-t1_0151z.gif&lt;/ref&gt;

| Upper Sannian
|spoken in the border area between Ukraine and Poland in the San river valley. Often confused as Lemko or Lyshak.
|-
|[[Balachka]]
|spoken in the [[Kuban]] region of Russia, by the [[Kuban Cossacks]]. The [[Kuban Cossacks]] being descendants of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] are beginning to consider themselves as a separate ethnic identity. Their dialect is based on Middle Dnieprian with the [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] grammar. It includes dialectical words of central Ukrainian with frequent inclusion of Russian vocabulary, in particular for modern concepts and items. It varies somewhat from one area to another.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
|}

[[Rusyn language|Rusyn]] is considered by some Rusyn linguists and Rusyns to be a separate language:
* Rusyn has only been recently considered a Slavic literary language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plišková|first1=Anna|title=Practical Spheres of the Rusyn Language in Slovaka|journal=Studia Slavica Hung.|date=2008|volume=53|issue=1|pages=95-115|doi=10.1556/SSlav.53.2008.1.6|url=http://www.rusyn.org/images/6.%20Practical%20Spheres%20of%20Rusyn%20Langauge%20in%20Slovakia.pdf|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was codified only recently in Slovakia in 1995.  Rusyn has been spoken for several hundred years by over 1100 Rusyn Villages in the Carpathian Mountains and surrounding areas.  The Rusyn however varies from location to location and is influenced by the languages that are spoken nearby which can include Polish, Slovakian, Hungarian, Romanian and literary Ukrainian.

The [[Rusyn language]] is considered to be a dialect of Ukrainian by Ukrainian linguists:
* Dolinian Rusyn or Subcarpathian Rusyn is spoken in the [[Transcarpathian Oblast]].&lt;!--Distinctive Features--&gt;
* [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian or Bačka Rusyn]] is spoken in northwestern [[Serbia]] and eastern [[Croatia]]. [[Rusin language]] of the Bačka dialect has been recognised as one of the official languages of the Serbian Autonomous Province of [[Vojvodina]]).
* Pryashiv Rusyn is the Ukrainian dialect spoken in the Prešov (in Ukrainian: [[Pryashiv]])  region of [[Slovakia]], as well as by some émigré communities, primarily in the United States of America.

== Emigre dialects ==
Ukrainian is also spoken by a large émigré population, particularly in [[Ukrainian Canadians|Canada]], [[Ukrainian Americans|The United States]], [[Ukrainian Brazilians|Brazil]], [[Ukrainian Argentines|Argentina]], and [[Ukrainian Australians|Australia]]. The founders of this population primarily emigrated from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], which used to be part of [[Austro-Hungary]] before World War I, and belonged to [[Poland]] between the World Wars. The language spoken by most of them is based on the Galician dialect of Ukrainian from the first half of the twentieth century. Compared with modern Ukrainian, the vocabulary of Ukrainians outside Ukraine reflects less influence of Russian, yet may contain Polish or German [[Loanword|loanwords]]. It often contains many loanwords from the local language as well (e.g. снікерси ''sneekersy,'' for "sneakers" in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://forgottengalicia.com/the-lexicon-of-the-third-wave-ukrainian-diaspora/|title=The Lexicon of the Third-Wave Ukrainian Diaspora – Forgotten Galicia|website=forgottengalicia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Recent trends ==

In recent times there have been attempts to categorise some of the Ukrainian dialects into separate languages. This has been happening primarily in the Carpathian regions of Ukraine, but also with the speakers of the Polissian dialect, the Kuban dialect and Rusyn. The debates as to independence of these dialects-languages has promoted inflamed discussions.
