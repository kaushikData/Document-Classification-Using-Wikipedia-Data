The '''1966 flood of the Arno''' ({{lang-it|Alluvione di Firenze del 4 novembre 1966}}) in [[Florence]] killed 101 people and damaged or destroyed millions of masterpieces of art and rare books. It is considered the worst [[flood]] in the city's history since 1557. With the combined effort of Italian and foreign volunteers alike, or ''angeli del fango'' ("Mud Angels"), many of these fine works have been restored. New methods in [[Art conservation|conservation]] were devised and [[Art conservation and restoration|restoration]] laboratories established. However, even decades later, much work remains to be done.

== Overview ==
Located in the [[Tuscany]] region of [[Central Italy]], the [[Arno]] river is approximately {{convert|240|km|mi}} long.  It flows from the Mount Falterona hills of the [[Apennine Mountains]] to the [[Ligurian Sea]], just {{convert|11|km|mi|0}} west of [[Pisa]].  Lush vineyards and olive groves line the river's scenic course to the west, out to sea. Principally utilized for [[irrigation]] purposes, only {{convert|32|km|mi}} of the river is used for navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Arno River | encyclopedia=Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia | year=2007 | url=http://gme.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0017000-0 | accessdate =23 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Arno River | encyclopedia=The World Book Encyclopedia | volume=1 | publisher=World Book, Inc. | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest flows of the river generally occur in spring and autumn of every year, when rainfall in the Apennines is at its greatest. The intensity of the 1966 flood was further increased by both the [[orography]] of the Apennines, which contributed to the high run-off rates and river discharges, and urban development. Roads, such as the Via de Calzaiuoli, served as narrow channels for floodwaters, allowing for their greater speed and destruction within the city; bridges, on the other hand, hindered river flow where it was needed, allowing water to pour over the [[floodplain]] with great force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Florence Floods: 4 November 1966 | journal=The Geographical Journal | date=June 1967 | volume=133 | issue=2 | pages=277–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline of events ==
[[File:1966 Arno Florence flood 2008.JPG|thumb|Square in Florence with a white [[high water mark]] of the 1966 flood. At this point the marker is about {{convert|4|m|ft}} high.]]

===3 November===

* After a long period of steady rain, the Levane and La Penna dams in Valdarno began to discharge more than {{convert|2000|m3|cuft}} of water per second toward Florence.
* At 14:30, the Civil Engineering Department reported "'an exceptional quantity of water.'"
* Cellars in the [[Florence#Subdivisions|Santa Croce]] and San Frediano areas began to flood.
* Police received calls for assistance from villagers up the Arno Valley.
* The flood's first victim, a 52-year-old worker, died at the Anconella [[Water purification|water treatment plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===4 November 1966===

* At 04:00, engineers, fearing that the Valdarno dam would burst, discharged a mass of water that eventually reached the outskirts of Florence at a rate of {{convert|60|km/h}}.
* At 07:26, the Lungarno delle Grazie cut off gas, electricity and water supplies to affected areas.
* By 08:00, army barracks were flooded.
* By 09:00, hospital emergency generators (the only source of electrical power remaining) failed.
* Landslides obstructed roads leading to Florence, while narrow streets within city limits funneled floodwaters, increasing their height and velocity.
* By 09:45, the [[Piazza del Duomo, Florence|Piazza del Duomo]] was flooded.
* The powerful waters ruptured central heating oil tanks, and the oil mixed with the water and mud, causing greater damage.
* Florence was divided in two, and officials were unable to immediately reach citizens of the city past the Piazza Michelangelo.
* At its highest, the water reached over {{convert|6.7|m|ft}} in the Santa Croce area.
* By 20:00, the water began to lower.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clarkson, Christopher | title = The Florence Flood of November 1966 &amp; Its Aftermath | year = 2003 | url = http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/publication/ndl_newsletter/135/lecture1_135_353.pdf | format = PDF

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The flood has had a lasting impact on Florence, economically and culturally. City officials and citizens were unprepared for the storm and the widespread devastation that it caused. There were virtually no emergency measures in place, at least partially because Florence is located in an area where the frequency of flooding is relatively low. In fact, approximately 90% of the city's population were completely unaware of the imminent disaster.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Residents were set to celebrate their country's World War I victory over [[Austria]] on 4 November, [[Armed Forces Day#Italy|Armed Forces Day]]. In commemoration, businesses were closed and many of their employees were out of town for the public holiday. While many lives were likely spared as a result, the locked buildings greatly inhibited the salvaging of valuable materials from numerous institutions and shops, with the exception of a number of jewellery stores whose owners were warned by their nightwatchmen.

5,000 families were left homeless by the storm, and 6,000 stores were forced out of business.  Approximately 600,000 tons of mud, rubble and sewage severely damaged or destroyed numerous collections of books, manuscripts and fine art. In fact, it is estimated that between 3 and 4 million books and manuscripts were damaged, as well as 14,000 movable works of art.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003" /&gt;

Artist [[Marco Sassone]], in a 1969 interview, recalled the impact of the flood on Florence's residents: "The only thing you could do was watch and be helpless. Nature was master...the women became crazy with fear. They began throwing things from the windows and screaming 'who is going to save my children?'" It was reported that 101 people lost their lives in the flood waters.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Phyllis. County Artist Relives Florence Disaster. The Register, Sunday 2 November 1969, p 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collections affected===
* Archives of the Opera del [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo]] (Archivio di Opera del Duomo): 6,000 volumes of documents and 55 illuminated manuscripts were damaged.
* [[Gabinetto Vieusseux|Gabinetto Vieusseux Library]] (Biblioteca del Gabinetto Vieusseux): All 250,000 volumes were damaged, including titles of romantic literature and Risorgimento history; submerged in water, they became swollen and distorted. Pages, separated from their text blocks, were found pressed upon the walls and ceiling of the building.
* [[National Central Library (Florence)|National Central Library]] (Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Firenze): Located alongside the Arno, the National Library was cut off from the rest of the city by the flood. 1,300,000 items (a third of their holdings) were damaged, including prints, maps, posters, newspapers and a majority of works in the Palatine and Magliabechi collections.
* The State Archives ([[Archivio di Stato di Firenze|Archivio di Stato]]): Roughly 40% of the collection was damaged, including property and financial records; birth, marriage and death records; judicial and administrative documents; and police records, among others.

== Funding and assistance ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--most of section has no citations--&gt;
Realizing the immense wealth and importance of Florentine culture in a global context, many individuals and organizations contributed to the conservation mission, providing both funding and manpower. Art historian and professor Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti assembled a committee with [[List of mayors of Florence|Mayor Piero Bargellini]] as chairman to raise awareness of the needs of Florence's art and academic institutions. Members included prominent figures from around the world, representatives of their own respective institutions.

A number of other international committees were formed with the intention of sponsoring various institutions in Florence:
* The Franco-Italian Committee aided the Church of Santa Maria Maddalena di Pazzi in Borgo Pinti.
* The U.S. Committee to Rescue Italian Art, composed of 25 sub-committees and chaired by [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], assisted in restoring frescoes around the city.
* The Viennese armory was responsible for restoring the arms and armor of the [[Bargello]] Museum.
* A Dutch committee sponsored the Buonarroti House Museum.
* A group of Germans repaired the musical instruments of the Bardini Museum.
The work of and contributions made by these committees were supervised by a central committee in Rome.

Additional funding came from various governments, [[UNESCO]], and the International Committee for the Assistance of Museums, Works of Art, Libraries and Archives, among others.  The city of [[Edinburgh]] (Scotland), twinned with Florence, sent practical help for the citizens in the form of double-decker buses to temporarily replace those which had been lost in the floods.  When these eventually returned home, they operated with the international 'GB' registration plate still affixed to the rear; each also carried a small plaque presented by the Florentine transport authorities indicating their gratitude for the gesture made by the people of Edinburgh.

Charity auctions were also organised. In a show of support for the Florentine art community, [[Pablo Picasso]] had one of his paintings, ''Recumbent Woman Reading'', auctioned off on an internationally televised programme. He donated the $105,000 it earned to restoration efforts in Italy. Similarly, [[Pietro Annigoni]] and [[Luciano Guarnieri]] donated the money they earned from selling 575 colour [[lithographs]] (depicting the events surrounding the flood and its aftermath), produced from 13 of their drawings.

Florentine native [[Franco Zeffirelli]] produced the short documentary ''[[Florence: Days of Destruction]]'' to raise awareness of the flood. Released a month after the disaster, it reputedly raised more than $20 million for reconstruction efforts.&lt;ref name='NGA'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/podcasts/lectures/2011.shtm |title=National Gallery of Art - Videos and Podcasts, December 2011 |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=29 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201205345/http://www.nga.gov/podcasts/lectures/2011.shtm |archivedate=1 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was narrated in English and Italian by actor [[Richard Burton]].&lt;ref name='DukeLib'&gt;{{cite web| url=https://blogs.library.duke.edu/preservation/2012/02/15/florence-days-of-destruction-a-film-by-franco-zeffirelli/|title=Preservation Underground - Florence: Days of Destruction (A Film by Franco Zeffirelli)|publisher=Duke University Library|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many institutions from around the world financially compensated employees who travelled to Italy and aided in the restoration of Florence, many others volunteered their services for absolutely no pay. Collectively, these people have been fondly referred to as "Mud Angels", due to their commitment to working in such deplorable conditions.&lt;ref name="Batini 1967"&gt;{{cite book | last=Batini | first=Giorgio | title=4 November 1966: The River Arno in the Museums of Florence:Galleries, Monuments, Churches, Libraries, Archives and Masterpieces Damaged by the Flood | year=1967 | publisher=Bonechi | location=Florence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Thorough flood... | journal=The Burlington Magazine | date=November 1986 | volume=128 | issue=1004 | page=779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Mud Angels"===
[[List of mayors of Florence|Mario Primicerio]], the mayor of Florence from 1995 to 1999, helped celebrate the Mud Angels' (''angeli del fango'') efforts during an anniversary celebration in 1996. Thirty years earlier, he was a professor who lent his assistance in preserving the priceless artefacts of Florence. The Angels cleaned the city of refuse, mud and oil, and retrieved works of art, books and other materials from flooded rooms; experts from around the world volunteered their time and knowledge in the conservation of the aforementioned materials.

In a 1996 interview, Primicerio offered three principal reasons as to why the Mud Angels felt compelled to help: a concern for future generations, a feeling of international unity and a pervasive sense of solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first=Mario |last=Primicerio |url=http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/intventt.htm |title=We are really delighted to invite the Mud Angels to Florence: Interview with Mario Primicerio, the Mayor of Florence |year=1996 |accessdate=21 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217085124/http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/intventt.htm |archivedate=17 February 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|What we were doing was dictated by the desire to give back the traces of the history of the past to future generations, so that it could be used for the spiritual growth of people who perhaps had yet to be born...it was the international community that worked to try to save Florence, this unique patrimony which belonged to the whole world.|Mario Primicerio|Speciale Alluvione}}

===The "Flood Ladies"===
The [[Flood Ladies]] were a group of international female artists who contributed artworks to the city of Florence following the catastrophic 1966 flood of the Arno as a sign of solidarity and to help repair the psychological damage done by the flood. The group was formed in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] in 1966. Contributors to the collection lived all over the world. In 2014 the organization Advancing Women Artist Foundation headed an effort to preserve, exhibit and acknowledge the contribution of these women.

== Conservation measures ==
Many experts in the field of conservation, such as [[Peter Waters]], utilised their knowledge in restoring the works of art and literature ravaged by the flood. Staff from the Central Institute of Restoration and Institute of Book Pathology, for example, volunteered their time, efforts, and expertise in this enormous undertaking. New concepts, such as "phased conservation," and methods in conservation, such as mass deacidification, were conceived during this period after the flood ravaged the city of Florence.&lt;ref name="channel4.com"&gt;{{cite web | title = Cities and Disaster: The Florence Flood of 1966 | url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html| accessdate =5 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070517215628/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html| archivedate= 17 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books and records===
Priorities were established during the process of conserving damaged books and records, the most critical of which became the retrieval of materials from flooded rooms. After they were rescued, books and records were typically washed and disinfected. In certain cases, [[Bookbinding|bindings]] were cut and sheets treated individually.  Following a thorough cleansing, the materials were then dried in Florentine libraries, space permitting, or at locations outside of the city, such as [[kiln|tobacco kilns]] and [[granaries]]. In some circumstances, large quantities of books were covered with sawdust, as a means of drawing out moisture. When not washed prior to drying, dried mud was then scraped off the exterior of the books.

One or both of two drying techniques was applied: interleaving by hand and/or drying with the aid of domestic heaters or other mechanical equipment. Interleaving involved the placement of blotting papers within the text-block of a book and replacing them once they were fully soaked; a variety of papers were used, including mimeograph paper and green blotting paper (the latter of which ultimately caused more damage). In kilns, the [[humidity]] level was slowly lowered from ninety to forty percent. If deemed necessary, bindings were removed and dried separately.  Removed pages were hung out to dry on an apparatus similar to a [[clothes line]].

Fearing the spread of [[mold]], workers completed these tasks with the greatest speed possible. After they were disinfected and dried, the items were then reassembled, restored and, if necessary, rebound. [[Library catalog|Card catalogs]] and in some cases, the actual books and documents were reproduced by reprinting on early [[Printing press|presses]], [[photocopying]], or copying by hand.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Batini 1967" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="The Florentine Flood Disaster"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Florentine Flood Disaster | journal=The Burlington Magazine | date=April 1967 | volume=109 | issue=769 | pages=192–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Libraries and Archives of Florence | journal=Times Literary Supplement | date=1 December 1966| first=Nicolai | last=Rubinstein | page=1133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url = http://data.scl.utah.edu/fmi/xsl/stream/details.xsl?-recid=354&amp;a::v=1O9iEOa749 | title = The Restoration of Books: Florence 1968 | medium = DVD | publisher = Royal College of Art | location = London | date = 1968 | accessdate= 27 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====The National Library Centers of Florence: a case study====
Initially the transportation of large numbers of books to other institutes (to repair and rebind) was considered, but decided against on logistical grounds. Within six months of the flood, the National Library of Florence had 144 workers on hand: three binders, eight binder trainees, two librarians, forty-two workmen, eighty-one student volunteers and eight other library staff members.

Together they devised a logical and efficient method of book repair, involving nine separate and clearly defined steps:

* Books were selected for treatment. The details of work to be done were recorded on a formatted card that accompanied its respective book throughout its treatment. Once work was completed, the card was permanently filed. A universal language utilising symbols, created with [[foreign worker]]s in mind, was employed in the formatting of this card.  Symbols were assigned to key phrases that communicated the condition of each book and how its repair was to be conducted, such as:
** historically important-only to be dealt with by experts
** incomplete
** medium mud
** rebind
** collation part missing
* The book was photographed.
* The book's collation was verified and its covers removed and stored in a marked case (if they were to be used in a new binding).
* If necessary, the book was carefully taken apart to wash it in warm water and disinfect it with Topane.
* In certain cases, the leaves of the book were [[mass deacidification|deacidified]] and buffered.
* The text-block was pressed.
* The text-block was dried in specially designed cabinets.
* Sections of the book were then reconstructed and the text-blocks collated.
* Finally, each book was wrapped in a paper sheet that had been impregnated with an antimicrobial substance, then they were set aside for any later repair or rebinding. The binding was completed in the main reading room of the library, which had been converted (temporarily) for this purpose.

This methodical nine-part system enabled workers to process between seventy and a hundred books a day.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003" /&gt;

After the Florence flood, the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale was not allowed to put books back into the lower levels.&lt;ref&gt;Lenzuni, Anna. “Coping with Disaster.” Preservation of library materials: conference held at the National Library of Austria, Vienna, 7–10 April 1986. Ed. Merrily A. Smith. IFLA publications, 40–41. München: Saur, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paintings===
Many panel paintings were critically damaged as a result of water saturating their wood, causing the glue and [[gesso]], which compose the priming layer, to dissolve. Consequently, the paintings' colours dissolved as well. In addition, the moisture caused paintings to buckle and crack or develop blisters, and the paint to chip and fall.  Actions were taken to stabilize the problem by applying [[rice paper]] to the affected paintings and storing them in cool, stable environments where humidity was slowly decreased. In extreme cases, the paint layer was extracted from the wood and gesso and then reapplied to a new support. [[Nystatin]], an antifungal, was sprayed on the wood to prevent mold from growing. Treatment facilities were established at locations such as the Boboli Garden Lemon-House, where over two hundred of these panel paintings were restored.

Similar measures were necessary to conserve canvas paintings. First, an original canvas was relined and gauze applied to the painted surface, which was then ironed. This process is referred to as the ''rintelatura'', or "new canvas" method. Relatively minor surface work was often completed with a variety of solvents and/or types of [[resin]].

===Frescoes===
[[Fresco]]es demanded more complicated treatment. Normally water, once it evaporates, will leave a layer of residual salt on the surface of the wall that absorbed it. In some instances, the resultant [[efflorescence]] obscured painted images. In other cases, the impermeability of the fresco plaster caused the salt to become trapped beneath the surface, causing bubbles to form and erupt, and the paint to fall. The adhesion of the plaster to the wall was often also seriously compromised. A fresco could only be detached when fully dry. To dry a fresco, workers cut narrow tunnels beneath it, in which heaters were placed to draw out moisture from below (instead of outwards, which would have further damaged the paintings). Within a few days, the fresco was ready to be detached.

Fuel oil, which coated many painted works of art, was removed by using Japanese tissue paper to apply a solvent, which dissolved the tar. An [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]], such as [[talcum powder]], was then distributed on the tissue paper.

===Sculpture and other objects===
It became imperative to clean sculpture immediately, before it fully absorbed the oil. Flaking sculpture was sprayed with a [[silicate]] mixture, while wooden pieces were treated with [[insecticides]] and toxic gases to kill insects and prevent future infestation. [[Weapon]]ry, like firearms and swords, were taken apart, cleaned with [[Kerosene|paraffin]], and finally lubricated to prevent future rusting.

[[Bronze]] objects were kept in dehumidification chambers for a few weeks and cleaned with distilled water or polished. For more severely damaged pieces, experts completed "depth cleaning," which entailed the use of small drills and vacuuming. Similar measures were taken with gold.  Broken objects were reassembled using photographs and other retrieved documentation.&lt;ref name="Batini 1967" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Florentine Flood Disaster" /&gt;

===Effect on preservation and conservation awareness===
The disastrous results of the flood established an international awareness of the need for preservation and conservation education and facilities.  In the United States, for example, it is no coincidence that the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] was passed in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stipe | first=Robert and Antoinette J. Lee | url=http://www.emich.edu/public/geo/history.html#preservationact | title=The American Mosiac: Preserving A Nation's Heritage | year=1987 | publisher= U.S. Committee, International Council on Monuments and Sites | location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate= 4 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the next twenty years:
{{Quotation|2,000 to 3,000 preservation organizations actively engaged in public education, advocacy, preservation and restoration projects of various kinds, many of them operating revolving funds. In terms of geographic interest, distinctions among the regions are no longer drawn. Membership in the National Trust for Historic Preservation grew from 10,700 in 1966 to 185,000 in 1986. More than 35 university graduate professional and technical courses directly related to historic preservation were created in the interim. It would be reasonable to estimate that more than 54,000 jobs were created in the administrative aspect of preservation alone.|Robert E. Stipe and Antoinette J. Lee}}

===Work outstanding===
A significant amount of restorative work remains to be done in Florence.  Due to a lack of awareness, funding, and manpower, a great number of works of art and books lie in storage, dirty and damaged.  Christopher Clarkson, noted conservator, called attention to this problem in a 2007 letter, stating that the National Library still has a "warehouse" full of books to be repaired and bound; many others need cleaning or reassembling.  According to a 1993 report, approximately 25% of the 80,000 items belonging to the Magliabecchi and Palatino collections had not been fully restored in the nearly thirty years since the flood.  The number of conservators that work at the library presently is only about a tenth of the amount that worked there immediately after the flood.&lt;ref name="channel4.com"/&gt;

==Environmental measures==

Regional officials in Tuscany are responsible for organizing a massive project, the purpose of which is to not only protect the area from future flooding but to maintain high water quality and effectively utilize water resources.

Work commenced in 1984, with the construction of the Bilancino Dam, near Florence.  The Sieve tributary and spillway at [[Pontedera]] are among other developments.  The national government has funded a majority of these various subprojects, with the city of Florence being the primary recipient of the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bilancino Dam, A Reservoir for Florence | url=http://www.comune.firenze.it/servizi_pubblici/ambiente/acqua/ciclo/Inglese/1BILenglish.htm | accessdate =1 March 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041221224245/http://www.comune.firenze.it/servizi_pubblici/ambiente/acqua/ciclo/Inglese/1BILenglish.htm |archivedate = 21 December 2004|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alice Carmichael Harris''' (born November 23, 1947) is an American linguist. She is currently Professor of Linguistics at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], where she has been employed since 2009.

==Research==
Citing an early interest in the “systematic, almost mathematical aspects of languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://linguistlist.org:8888/studentportal/linguists/harris.cfm|title = LinguistList--Famous Linguists|date = |accessdate = May 17, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;” Harris began investigating [[ergativity]] in graduate school, and in doing so began to study the Georgian language. She was one of the first Americans allowed to do research in the Republic of Georgia when it was still part of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/alice-c-harris/|title = John Simon Guggenheim Foundation|date = |accessdate = May 17, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has continued to work in this region, looking at different characteristics of the languages [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Laz language|Laz]], [[Svan language|Svan]], [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]], [[Udi language|Udi]], and [[Batsbi]]. Harris also has a strong interest in promoting the larger topic of documenting endangered languages. She played a key role in establishing the [[Documenting Endangered Languages]] (DEL) Program, a granting sub-unit that is part of the [[National Science Foundation]].

==Career==
Harris received her Ph.D. in Linguistics from [[Harvard University]] in 1976 after studying at [[Randolph College|Randolph-Macon Women's College]], the [[University of Glasgow]] and the [[University of Essex]].&lt;ref name="Brief CV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief CV|url=http://people.umass.edu/acharris/Resources/Brief%20CV.pdf|website=UMA|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She taught at [[Vanderbilt University]] from 1979-2002, serving as the department chair of Germanic and Slavic Languages there from 1993-2002. She was Professor of Linguistics at [[SUNY Stony Brook]] from 2002-2009.

==Awards==

*In 1998, a book she co-wrote in 1995 with [[Lyle Campbell]] won the Leonard Bloomfield award from the LSA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women, Language and Linguistics: Three American Stories from the First Half of the Twentieth Century. Studies in the History of Linguistics.|last = Falk, Julia S.|first = Julia S.|publisher = Routledge|year = 1999|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 260}}&lt;/ref&gt; an award given out every two years to a book that makes an outstanding contribution to the understanding of languages or linguistics.  
*Harris received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/alice-c-harris/|title = John Simon Guggenheim Foundation|date = |accessdate = May 17, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Association for Australasian Literary Studies''' (AAALS) is an organization of scholars in [[North America]] that studies and promotes research in the literature of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Its activities are partially funded by the Literature Fund of the [[Australia Council for the Arts]]. It publishes the journal ''Antipodes, A Global Journal of Australian/NZ Literature'' and holds an annual conference, rotated between locations in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The most recent AAALS conferences were held at [[Harvard University]] in 2005; at [[McGill University]] in 2006;  at [[Georgetown University]] in 2007, at the [[University of Texas]] in 2008;  in Washington, DC in 2010, Fort Worth, TX in 2011,   Toronto 2012, Washington DC (2013), Portland, Oregon (2014), [[Texas Christian University]]  in Fort Worth, TX (2015), and Seattle (2016). The current President is Nathanael O'Reilly of Texas Christian University; Eva Rueschmann of Hampshire College  serves as Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianliterature.org/AAALS_Officers.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was founded in 1986 by [[Robert L. Ross]] (1934-2005) and has since then assumed an increasing international profile. Featured guest speakers have included [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], [[David Malouf]], [[Lily Brett]], [[John Tranter]], [[Frank Moorhouse]], [[Thomas Keneally]], [[Alan Wearne]], [[Mudrooroo]], [[Kate Grenville]], Jeanine Leane, Lyn McCredden, David Carter,  [[Janette Turner Hospital]] and [[John Kinsella (poet)|John Kinsella]]. In 1996 the AAALS became an Allied Organization of the [[Modern Language Association]], at which it holds sessions annually. &lt;br/&gt;The official [[scholarly journal]] of the AAALS is entitled '''''Antipodes'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informit.com.au/products/productdetails.aspx?id=0893-5580&amp;container=APAFT |title=Antipodes |work=[[RMIT University]] |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Antipodes'' appears twice a year, each issue containing ten or so academic articles, plus poems, short stories, and book reviews.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57124">'''Antiquarian science books''' are original historical works (e.g., books or technical papers)  concerning [[List of important publications in science|science]], [[List of important publications in mathematics|mathematics]] and sometimes [[engineering]]. 
These books are important primary references for the study of the [[history of science and technology]], they can provide valuable insights into the historical development of the various fields of scientific inquiry ([[History of science]], [[History of mathematics]], etc.)

The landmark  are significant first (or early) editions typically worth hundreds or thousands of dollars (prices may vary widely based on condition, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Prices quoted were collected using sources such as {{cite web|url=https://ilab.org/buy_books |title=International League of Antiquarian Booksellers |accessdate=2018-06-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509062742/http://www.ilab.org/services/searchform.php |archivedate=2008-05-09 }}  {{cite web|url=https://www.abaa.org/ |title=ABAA |accessdate=2018-06-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701041121/http://search.abaa.org/dbp2/searchform.php |archivedate=2009-07-01 }} http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchEntry http://www.sothebys.com http://www.christies.com&lt;/ref&gt; 
Reprints of these books are often available, for example from [[Great Books of the Western World]], [[Dover Publications]] or [[Google Book Search|Google Books]].

[[Incunabula]] are extremely rare and valuable, but as the "[[scientific revolution]]" is only taken to have started around the 1540s, such works of [[Renaissance literature]] (including [[alchemy]], [[Renaissance magic]], etc.) are not usually included under the notion of "scientific" literature. Printed originals of the beginning scientific revolution thus date to the 1540s or later, notably beginning with the original publication of [[Copernican heliocentrism]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'  ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' of 1543 sold for more than US$2 million at auctions.&lt;ref&gt;US$2,210,500 at a [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/copernicus-nicolaus-de-revolutionibus-orbium-coelestium-5084091-details.aspx Christies] auction in 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of notable books==
&lt;!-- for an item to be listed here, it should either have a dedicated Wikipedia article already, or there should be a citation confirming that the book is either widely considered a "milestone" or something, or that the book has been sold for a huge sum at some auction, etc.

'''Antiques restoration''' is restoring an [[antique]] or work of [[art]] to a like-new condition, or preserving an antique or work of art against further deterioration as in [[art conservation|conservation]].

==Restoration==
[[File:Antiques restoration.jpg|thumb|Antiques restoration, [[National Museum, Warsaw]]]]

Restoration can be as simple as light cleaning to remove disfiguring dirt or grime, such as on the surface of a painting, or it may include near complete rebuilding or replacement, as might be the case with old [[automobile]]s or [[furniture]]. Often done in preparation for sale, or by a [[art collector|collector]] upon acquiring a new piece, the main goal of restoration is to "restore" the original appearance or functionality of a piece.

There is a lot of difference between restoring and repairing. Functionality may be achieved by a repair, but restoring an item properly is an art-form. Finishes might/may be stripped and redone, but it is essential that the original [[patina]]tion is retained, if possible. Stripping is only done as a last resort, especially with antique furniture. Engines might be rebuilt with new parts as necessary, or holes in a silver pot might/may be patched. While some of these practices are frowned on by many museums, scholars, and other experts, for many people{{fact|date=December 2015}} there is little value in an antique that is unusable or not able to be displayed. Poor restoration is the bane of a trained restorer. Working on someone else's bad repair is the worst possible situation. Often with antique restoration, there are also other issues as well. For example, some collectors value "patina", or also want an item to still reflect an aesthetic that shows its age- in this respect, an "over restored" item can actually take away from its value than if nothing has been done to the item at all. Therefore, restoration of valuable objects should always be left to professionals who are sensitive to all of the issues, ensuring that a piece retains or increases its value after restoration.

Original artwork can sustain all sorts of damage over its lifetime. Conservatorshave an obligation to the artwork to recommend the best techniques for preserving it for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiebold.com/paintings_and_frames "Paintings and Frames"] 2000-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Restorers are often trained craftspersons, such as furniture makers, [[mechanic]]s, or [[smith (metalwork)|metalsmiths]]. Some have years of experience in their fields, whereas others are self-taught volunteers. Many of the antique aircraft around the [[United States]] are restored by trained aircraft engineers assisted by volunteers, some of whom are men who flew those same aircraft years ago.

Given that a single piece of furniture may include wood, glass, inlay, leather and fabric, antique restoration encompasses several skills. Caldararo estimates that 90 percent of USA restorers are self-taught, or cobble together their skills from idiosyncratic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Davis Kho. [http://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/Restoring-antiques-a-nearly-lost-art-3253209.php "Restoring antiques a nearly lost art."] ''San Francisco Chronicle''. January 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[French polish|French Polishing]]" was the industry standard in [[Europe]] during the 18th and 19th centuries, pushed aside by the efficient advantage of modern methods in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. [[Lacquer]]s and spray systems replaced the original French polish finish, which is impractical for mass furniture production due to the labor-intensive process of application. As the desire for antiques was not idle, neither was the need for them to be appropriately restored; thus, the trade has been kept alive by a thread.

===Restoration terminology===
*[[Conservation-restoration|Conservation]]: Detail-oriented process designed to preserve as much original finish and materials as possible while bringing the piece back to as close to its original condition as possible.
*[[Finish restoration]]: Finish restoration is the process of bringing an existing finish back to life. This involves re-emulsifying the original finish, either shellac or varnish. By using the original solvents to liquefy the solids, their ability to adhere to and penetrate the piece returns. The process also removes the dirt and grime accumulated over years of use. If the finish is very thin, additional layers of the same finish may be applied to bolster the restored finish and ensure longevity. Finish restoration results in an original finish rating: for example, 85% of the original finish remains. The more original finish that remains, the more antique value remains.
*[[Historic preservation|Preservation]]: The process of stopping or slowing deterioration usually does not involve actual restoration or attempts to return the piece to its original condition. Damage and finish deterioration are left intact, but prevented from going further. This process is usually done on museum works; we recommend a conservation or restoration process for home use of antiques. In most cases this is a chemical process that prevents further oxidation of the wood and metals, and in addition adds moister to the existing finish. 
*[[Refinishing]]: Removing a finish and applying a new finish in its place. This process destroys significant portions of antique value in furniture and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. 
*[[Repair]]: Physical structural replacement or reinforcement of parts of the original piece. May involve addition of new materials altered to appear aged or the application of antique materials to improve appearance of repair and preserve as much value as possible. 
*[[Art restoration|Restoration]]: Bringing a piece back to close to its original condition including structural and finish repairs. 
*[[Paint stripper|Stripping]]:  stripping involves dipping the piece in a chemical bath that will remove finish, patina, and in some cases the glue holding the piece together.&lt;ref&gt;Eric &amp; Stanley Saperstein [http://www.artisansofthevalley.com/docs/the_philosophy_of_restoration.pdf "The Philosophy of Restoration"] December 2002 page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salvage==
On the other extreme, though most bad old pieces were thrown away long ago, there are pieces that, because of their original design or workmanship or because of damage, are not worth restoring but that are made of re-usable materials such as hard wood, amber, pewter or ivory.  As the number of people increases and the number of trees and other natural products in the world decreases, wood and other materials becomes more scarce.  So the fact that the material was not worth doing a good job with when an item was made does not mean that the material should be discarded along with the object now.

'''Asim Peco''' ({{IPA-sh|ǎːsim pěːtso|pron}}; 24 May 1927 – 7 December 2011) was a renowned [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] linguist, [[academician]], professor, author and editor.&lt;ref name="gacko"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=hr&amp;u=http://www.gacko.net/asim_peco.htm&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Asim%2BPeco%2522%26start%3D10%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3DynO%26sa%3DN |title=Asim Peco |accessdate=2008-09-08 |publisher=gacko.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peco's work is credited for the development of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]n and [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinian]] linguistics. His areas of specialization include the dialectology of Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[Serbia]], namely the [[Štokavian]] and [[Torlakian]] dialects.&lt;ref name="comart"/&gt; He wrote books on the speeches of eastern and central Herzegovina, speeches of western Herzegovina, Ikavian-Štokavian dialects of Bosnia and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] [[loan words]] into them.

His work is cited or referenced by many. For example, his research on eastern Bosnian dialect was discussed at the [[United Nations]]' [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/transe33/010319ed.htm |page=8695 |title=Monday, 19 March 2001 [Open session] Upon commencing at 9.38 a.m. |accessdate=2008-09-09 |date=2001-03-19 |work= |publisher=[[United Nations]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411201601/http://www.un.org/icty/transe33/010319ed.htm |archivedate=2008-04-11 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Peco was born in the village of Ortiješ, near [[Mostar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to Jusuf and Hajrija Peco. His brother, Džemal Peco, was a teacher.&lt;ref name="gacko"/&gt;

After graduating ''Viša pedagoška škola'' high school in [[Sarajevo]], Peco went to [[Belgrade]] where he enrolled the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology|Faculty of Philology]], which was a department within the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] at the time. His 1958 PhD dissertation was entitled ''Govor istočne Hercegovine'' ("The speech of eastern Herzegovina").&lt;ref name="gacko"/&gt; Already in high school Peco showed interest in scientific research.

==Career==
After completing his education at the University of Belgrade, Peco became a regular professor of Philology at the university,&lt;ref name="comart"/&gt; where he was elected several times as a head of the department for Serbo-Croatian and South Slavic languages. He was a mentor for numerous M.A. and Ph.D. theses, and a participant to numerous domestic and international conferences.

He was a Member and contributor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anubih.ba/index.php?option=content&amp;lang=eng&amp;Theme=speceditions1&amp;Level=2&amp;ItemID=7 |title=Special editions |accessdate=2008-09-09 |publisher=anubih.ba }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] since 1978, and a Corresponding (Foreign) Member of the [[Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts]] since 2003.&lt;ref name="comart"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canu.org.me/cmsen/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=36 |title=Division of arts - Corresponding (foreign) members |publisher=[[Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts]] MASA |accessdate=2010-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722173346/http://www.canu.org.me/cmsen/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=36 |archivedate=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peco edited journal ''Bosanskohercegovački dijalektološki zbornik'' ("Bosnian-Herzegovinian dialectological miscellany") for many years, and served a member of editing boards of many other journals.

In 1963, at the Fifth [[International Congress of Slavists]] held in [[Sofia, Bulgaria]], Peco complained about some of the participants, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...individual members of the delegation of the host country" in the Linguistic section "attempted to deny the right to independence of the [[Macedonian language]], a language which possesses both its own literature, and its own grammar... True, such opinions are not new. They are a reflection of old, non-Marxist theories, long ago trampled into oblivion by time. Fortunately, such concepts were not also the opinion of the [Bulgarian] delegation as a whole. Besides, this type of formulation was not based on fact, which would be difficult to deny. On the contrary, the baselessness of such formulations was easy to prove even without referring to great authorities, and without referring to the basic principles of Marxist science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''The Great Powers' Club''' or '''The Club of Great Powers''' is a term used by historians to refer to a collection of empires in the [[ancient Near East]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] between 1500-1100 BC, or the [[Late Bronze Age]]. These powers were  [[Assyria]], [[Babylon]], [[Egyptian Empire]], [[Hittite Empire]], and [[Mitanni]], viz. the major powers in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Anatolia]].

This period saw a systematic rise and fall of civilizations. Many civilizations went through the same cycle of creation, fluorescence, and fall of centralized states which include: the middle Elamite kingdom in western Iran, Kassite Babylonia in southern Mesopotamia, the Hittite new kingdom in Anatolia, and the new kingdom Egypt. While they did not all rise to the equal amount of power and influence at the same time, they did organize and participate in an international system of diplomacy, trade, and culture.&lt;ref name="Mieroop"&gt;Van De Mieroop, Marc. "The Club of Great Powers." In ''A History of the Ancient Near East, Ca. 3000-323 B.C.'' 2nd ed., [[Malden, Massachusetts]]: Blackwell Pub., 2007, {{ISBN|978-1405149112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As states went through cycles of growth and expansion, usually one or two states were more powerful than the rest, and a political hierarchy was naturally formed, with each state knowing their respective place. As leaders rose to power in respective states throughout the regions and although they wanted to expand their empire and grow their power, they realized the immense benefits of diplomacy. A system of trade, not of the state’s resources, but of the properties of the kings, was initiated.&lt;ref name="Mieroop"/&gt;

==Items traded==
States interacted through letters, written in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], the international language of diplomacy, and through oral messages. Marriages were a sure way to strengthen diplomatic ties and peace. One exception to this system was Egypt, which never gave royal women, but happily accepted the royal women of other states. Another commonly traded item was gifts. Each state had a specialty in what they could produce in their region. Egypt mined gold, Lebanon logged cedars, murex shells valued for their dye came from Northern Africa, [[Canaan]] specialized in jewelry, and Cyprus had its glass, beads of gold, [[faience]], and agate.&lt;ref name="Mieroop"/&gt;

==Sources==
One of the main primary sources we have of this Club of Great Powers comes from the [[Amarna letters]] in Egypt. King Akhenaten moved the capital of Egypt to [[Amarna]] and there kept the correspondence of him and his father with the rest of the members of the Club of Great Powers. A collection of 350 clay tablets was found there. The vast majority of the letters were written to Egypt’s vassals in the Syria-Palestine region, and a minority are written to kings whom the Egyptians kings considered equal. They were the kings of Babylonia, Assyria, Mittani, Hatti, Alashiya (on Cyprus), and Arzawa (in south-west Anatolia). Collections of letters on clay tablets are also found throughout the Near East.&lt;ref name="Mieroop"/&gt;

'''Communist Workers' Party – For Peace and Socialism''' ({{lang-fi|Kommunistinen Työväenpuolue – Rauhan ja Sosialismin puolesta}}, KTP) is a [[political party]] in [[Finland]]. It was founded in 1988 to secure the existence of an independent [[Marxist-Leninist]] party. Since its founding, it has not gained seats in the parliament, and as a result, has been removed from the party register and re-registered three times.

==History==
The Finnish Communist movement was split in the mid-1980s after years of infighting. Those expelled from the [[Communist Party of Finland]] (SKP) formed the [[Communist Party of Finland (Unity)]] (SKPy) which, however, itself soon split into different factions. KTP was founded in 1988 by one part of Finnish Communists who thought the SKPy had ventured too far from the principles of [[Marxism-Leninism]]. The final decision to found a new registered Communist party was made in the autumn 1987 seminar held at [[Matinkylä]]. The Marxist-Leninists behind the project felt themselves neglected since the Dipoli congress of the SKPy in 1986. Many of the KTP cadres came from the (expelled) [[Uusimaa]] district of the SKP which, since the late 1970s, had had its disputes with the opposition of the SKP led by the [[Tiedonantaja|Tiedonantaja society]].

In 2002 the KTP split over question of alliances possible for a Communist party. The Central Committee of the KTP rejected after voting (18–9) a proposed membership in a new (electoral) party, [[Forces for Change in Finland]] (MVS), in which clearly right-wing elements were also going to participate. MVS was supported especially by the [[Helsinki]] district organization of the KTP which then decided to enter the MVS without their comrades. KTP answered by expelling the above-mentioned organization and many leading members of the party, including [[Heikki Männikkö]] (the party secretary),  [[Reijo Katajaranta]] (the editor-in-chief of the KTP organ) and [[Pekka Tiainen]] (the former presidential candidate in 1994), had to go. The Communists expelled then found their own organization, which was at first called plainly ''Communists'', but later changed to [[League of Communists (Finland)|League of Communists]] (or Communist League). The KTP has avoided contacts to their ex-members.

The KTP got some unexpected nationwide, and even international, publicity ahead the local elections in 2004 when the [[Turku]] and [[Raisio]] branches of the party made an electoral alliance with the far-right racist{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} [[Finnish People's Blue-whites]] (SKS).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The party leadership reacted strongly and condemned the manoeuvres. The alliances were, however, already signed and the KTP candidates stood in the two west coast cities with no success, although the KTP didn't advertise their rebel candidates. The man behind the alliances, [[Esko Luukkonen]], was discharged from all party responsibilities, and he (and the KTP Turku district organization) later joined the League of Communists.

==Politics==
The founders of the KTP were former supporters of the SKP opposition and as such came from the [[Leonid Brezhnev|brezhnevist]] tradition of Marxism-Leninism. The critique of the late [[Soviet Union]] has been, however, included in the party ideology from the beginning. In 1998, for example, the KTP announced that the estimations made on the nature of the era, during the 1970s and the 1980s, were no longer realistic or correct. Yet the Marxism-Leninism of the KTP is far from [[Eurocommunism]]. The party leaders may quote [[Joseph Stalin]] and traditional Leninist rhetoric is required.

The existence of an independent Communist party, which is not buried in any unprincipled coalition, has always been one of the central political issues in the KTP. [[Markus Kainulainen]], probably the best known politician in the KTP, was one of those who, already in 1969, in the then SKP, was in favor of a new party unlike the majority of the party opposition. In the 1980s, the KTP used to criticise the SKPy for not officially registering the party.

The KTP is strictly against the [[European Union]], the [[Euro]] currency and Finland's participation in these capitalist formations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The party has consistently boycotted the elections of [[European Parliament]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The KTP wholeheartedly supports the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (DPRK) and its current leadership. The party has published writings of [[Kim Jong-Il]] and many members of the KTP are actively participating in [[The Society for the Study of the Juche Idea|The Society for the Study of the ''Juche'' Idea]].

==Organization==
Every year, the KTP holds its party congresses in which the official delegates choose the members of the important Central Committee. Little change usually happens and Hannu Harju has led the party since the 1997 congress. He was preceded by [[Timo Lahdenmäki]].

The KTP has been a small party all its life and it currently has some 200 members. The candidates of the KTP in the parliamentary elections have failed to get the attention of voters and the party has managed to gather only a few thousand votes. The KTP has some local strongholds, like the city of [[Kemi]] in northern Finland where [[Pirkko Ezewuzie]] is the lone KTP councillor. The party, with its own lists, has also participated in the elections of some trade unions and cooperatives.

The KTP has international contacts even though the party is not a member of any international organization. The [[Russian Communist Workers' Party – Revolutionary Party of Communists]] has warm relations with the KTP as well as the Nordic [[Communist Party of Sweden (1995)|Communist Party of Sweden]] (SKP), [[Communist Party in Denmark]] (KPiD) and [[Communist Party of Norway]] (NKP).

''Työkansan Sanomat'' (TKS), which appears fifteen times a year, is the organ of the KTP. The current editor-in-chief of TKS is [[Hannu Tuominen]]. In local (Helsinki area) Lähiradio radio station the KTP has a weekly program called ''Työväen puolituntinen''.

[[File:Rocky Colavito 1959.png|thumb|223px|[[Rocky Colavito]], the curse's namesake, was a popular Cleveland player when he was traded in 1960. Colavito did not place the curse, but the Indians have not won the World Series since the controversial trade.]]
'''The Curse of Rocky Colavito''' is a phenomenon that supposedly prevents the [[Cleveland Indians]] [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise from winning, be it the [[World Series]], the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League Championship Series|pennant]], reaching [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] play, or even getting into a pennant race.  Its origin is traced back to the unpopular trade of right fielder [[Rocky Colavito]] to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for [[Harvey Kuenn]] in 1960. It was not claimed that Colavito placed the curse, and he has denied doing so. It is one of [[Cleveland sports curse|several curses]] believed to have stricken the city of Cleveland's major sports franchises for decades.

The Indians won the [[List of American League pennant winners|American League championship]] in [[1995 American League Championship Series|1995]], [[1997 American League Championship Series|1997]], and [[2016 American League Championship Series|2016]], but lost all three World Series.

==Origins==
On April 17, 1960, the [[Cleveland Indians]] traded [[Rocky Colavito]] to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for [[Harvey Kuenn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pluto|first=Terry|title=50 years later, the Cleveland Indians' trade of Rocky Colavito still stinks: Terry Pluto|url=http://www.cleveland.com/pluto/blog/index.ssf/2010/04/50_years_later_colavito_trade.html|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=April 16, 2010|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trade was unique because Colavito was 1959's American League home run champion, with 42, while Kuenn hit .353 as the A.L. batting champion. Fans in Cleveland were outraged by what they saw as the betrayal by the Indians' general manager, [[Frank Lane]]. In only two years with the Indians, Lane had taken a mostly successful 40-man roster and had traded away every player he had inherited.

Detroit fans were mostly happy about the trade.

==Birth of the curse==

The idea of the curse was first presented in print by [[Terry Pluto]], who had previously covered the Indians for ''[[The Plain Dealer]]''.  In his [[1994 in literature|1994]] book, ''The Curse of Rocky Colavito: A Loving Look at a 33-Year Slump'', Pluto suggested that the trade, made by Indians general manager [[Frank Lane]] to blunt Colavito's popularity and end his salary demands, led to a 33-season stretch where the Indians did not finish the season within 11 games of first place, from 1960 to {{by|1993}}.  By 1994, the team had not won a pennant since {{by|1954}}, or a World Series since [[1948 World Series|1948]].

In ''The Curse of Rocky Colavito'', Pluto writes of many of the misfortunes that struck the Indians following the Colavito trade:

*Getting Colavito back in {{by|1965}}, from the [[Kansas City Athletics]], but sending pitcher [[Tommy John]] and outfielder [[Tommie Agee]] to the [[Chicago White Sox]] in a three-team trade.  John, who had won only two games in the major leagues, would go on to win another 286, mostly for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and [[New York Yankees]], and play on four teams that reached the World Series.  Agee, still a prospect when traded, would win the American League's [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award in {{by|1966}}. He then would be traded to the [[New York Mets]], where his hitting and fielding would be a major factor in their {{by|1969}} World Championship season.
*Trading pitcher [[Mudcat Grant|Jim "Mudcat" Grant]] to the [[Minnesota Twins]] in {{by|1964}}, for [[Lee Stange]] and [[George Banks (baseball)|George Banks]].  Grant was 28 years old and had won 67 games in his career.  After the trade, he would win 78 more, including 21 in 1965, when he helped the Twins win their first pennant. Grant would later return to the Indians as a broadcaster.
*The alcoholism of pitcher [[Sam McDowell]], who went from being one of the game's top pitchers in the 1960s to an unreliable pitcher who left the game at age 32.  He would eventually stop drinking and become a counselor to athletes with drinking problems.
*The mental illness of first baseman [[Tony Horton (baseball)|Tony Horton]], a power hitter who couldn't handle the stress of playing in the major leagues, and left the game in the middle of the {{by|1970}} season at age 25.  Like McDowell, he would receive treatment and recover, but he never returned to baseball.
*The rushing of pitcher [[Steve Dunning]] to the major leagues.  The second overall pick in the 1970 baseball draft, Dunning was brought straight to the major leagues from [[Stanford University]] without ever pitching in the minors.  Called up too soon, he quit baseball in {{by|1977}}, at the age of 28, with a career record of 23 wins and 41 losses.
*The signing and injury of [[Wayne Garland]].  In {{by|1976}}, Garland, a 25-year-old right-handed pitcher for the [[Baltimore Orioles]], won 20 games and lost only 7.  A [[free agent]] after that season, the Indians offered him a contract worth $2.3 million over 10 years.  But Garland hurt his [[shoulder]] in his first spring training with the Indians, and chose to pitch through the pain rather than have immediate surgery and went 13-19 in 1977.  He retired in {{by|1980}}, at age 30, with a career record of 55-66.
*The {{by|1984}} trade of pitcher [[Rick Sutcliffe]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]], along with two other players, for outfielders [[Joe Carter]] and [[Mel Hall]] and two others.  Sutcliffe would help the Cubs win the National League Eastern Division title that year and won the NL's [[Cy Young Award]], then won it again in 1989.  He won 35 games in just over two seasons with the Indians, then won 114 more after they traded him.  Hall was a good hitter but a disappointment, and though Carter became one of baseball's top sluggers with the Indians, they never had a pitcher as good as Sutcliffe while Carter was on the team.  Carter would be traded to the [[San Diego Padres]] in {{by|1989}} for catcher [[Sandy Alomar, Jr.|Sandy Alomar]] and second baseman [[Carlos Baerga]], possibly the best trade in the Indians' recent history, as Alomar and Baerga would be major cogs in their 1990s success.  The Padres would trade Carter to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], where he would lead them to back-to-back World Series wins, including {{by|1993}}, when his home run won the [[1993 World Series|Series]].
*The {{by|1987}} baseball preview issue of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine.  Following a surprising 84-win season for the Indians in {{by|1986}}, the cover showed Indians sluggers Carter and [[Cory Snyder]], and carried the words '''"INDIAN UPRISING"''' and the sub-headline, ''"Believe it! Cleveland is the best team in the American League!"'' The Indians lost 101 games that year (finishing with the worst record in Major League Baseball that season), though some believe that this collapse was partially caused by the [[Sports Illustrated cover jinx|''Sports Illustrated'' cover jinx]] as well as this curse.
*The {{by|1993}} spring training boating accident that killed relief pitchers [[Steve Olin]] and [[Tim Crews]] and nearly killed starting pitcher [[Bob Ojeda]].  As reliever [[Kevin Wickander]] was so grief-stricken at the loss of Olin that he was traded in mid-season and never regained his effectiveness, the Indians essentially lost four pitchers due to one accident.

Since the book's publication in 1994, Pluto has written two sequels: ''Burying the Curse'' in 1995 and ''Our Tribe'' in [[1999 in literature|1999]], the latter insisting that the curse was still in place.

Despite the "evidence" of a curse on the team, Colavito has denied ever placing one.

=== Curse beyond Cleveland ===
On the day of the Colavito trade, the Indians played the Chicago White Sox in an exhibition game at 64-year-old [[Russwood Park]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  Colavito hit a home run in the second inning, and reporters in the press box were informed of the trade shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/columnists/david-waters/lifting-of-cleveland-sports-curse-good-news-for-memphis-fans-35ba3ced-a3ec-04be-e053-0100007f87c9-383703681.html|title=Lifting of Cleveland sports curse good news for Memphis fans|website=www.commercialappeal.com|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four hours after the game ended, Russwood Park - constructed primarily of wood in 1896 - was destroyed in a five-alarm fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://memphismagazine.com/ask-vance/the-russwood-park-fire/|title=The Russwood Park Fire|date=2013-05-01|website=Memphis magazine|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Another curse?===

Prior to the publication of Pluto's book ''The Curse of Rocky Colavito'', there had been another explanation for the Indians' difficulties, one that came after the 1954 World Series but preceded the 1960 Colavito trade.  The Indians fired manager [[Bobby Bragan]] in {{by|1958}}.  According to the story, although he always denied it, Bragan walked out to the pitcher's mound at [[Cleveland Stadium|Cleveland Municipal Stadium]] and placed a curse on the Indians, saying they would never win another pennant.

==Recent years==
In {{by|1994}}, the year Pluto's book was published, the Indians moved out of aging Municipal Stadium and opened what was then [[Progressive Field|Jacobs Field]].  They were just one game behind the White Sox in the newly created [[American League]] (AL) [[American League Central|Central]] division when a [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|strike]] put an end to the season.  Despite the abrupt end, this was the first time the Indians had genuinely been in a pennant race since 1959, Colavito's last season before being traded away.

In the years since they moved out of Municipal Stadium the Indians have enjoyed success in the regular season, winning nine division titles (including five in a row from 1995-1999) and three American League pennants. But disappointing failures in the post-season have demonstrated to believers that a curse may still loom over the ballclub.

*In the strike-shortened {{by|1995}} season, the Indians won 100 games in a 144-game season, finishing a record 30 games ahead of the second place [[1995 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]].  They swept the [[1995 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] in the [[1995 American League Division Series|AL Division Series (ALDS)]] and defeated the [[1995 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] in a six-game [[1995 American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series (ALCS)]]. They appeared in their first [[1995 World Series|World Series]] in 41 years, facing the [[1995 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], in a re-match of the [[1948 World Series]] which had been played when the Braves were still based in Boston. The Indians lost in 6 games, including a 1–0 loss in Game 6 in which the Indians only recorded one base hit the entire game. In Atlanta's five trips to the [[World Series]] during the decade, Cleveland would be the only American League team the Braves would defeat.
*In 1997, the Indians were again in the [[1997 World Series|World Series]], and faced the [[1997 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]], a team established five seasons earlier.  The series went to Game 7, and although the Indians scored first and led the Marlins 2–1 with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning, reliever [[José Mesa]] was unable to get the last two outs. The Marlins tied the game, and then won it in the bottom of the 11th, 3–2. 
*In {{by|1998}}, the Indians won the AL Central division, but lost the [[1998 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] to the [[1998 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], despite being up 2 games to 1 with Games 4 and 5 at home.
*In {{by|1999}}, they won the AL Central division, but lost the [[1999 American League Division Series|ALDS]] to the [[1999 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], dropping the last three games after winning the first two. The failure to win a World Series despite five straight division titles led to the firing of manager [[Mike Hargrove]].
*In {{by|2005}}, the Indians took a 92–63 record into the final week of the season with a firm grip on the wild card spot, only to lose 6 of their last 7 games and lose the Wild Card to the [[2005 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]].
*In {{by|2006}}, the Indians cut [[Brandon Phillips]] in order to retain [[Ramón Vázquez]]. Vazquez was later cut by the Indians, while Phillips became a stand-out player in Cincinnati,  winning 4 [[Gold Glove]]s, a [[Silver Slugger Award]], and becoming a three-time All-Star.
*In {{by|2007}} the Indians led the [[2007 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] 3 games to 1  in the [[2007 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], with [[Cy Young Award|AL Cy Young]] winner [[CC Sabathia]] pitching the closeout game at home.  But Boston rallied to win Games 5, 6, and 7 and outscored Cleveland 30–5 to secure the AL pennant, and eventually the World Series.
*In {{by|2009}}, two former Indians pitchers ([[CC Sabathia]] and [[Cliff Lee]]) started Game 1 of the [[2009 World Series|World Series]] for the [[2009 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] and [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]], respectively.  Both Sabathia and Lee had won [[Cy Young Award]]s with the Indians.
*In {{by|2013}} the Indians finished the season going 21–6 in September, including a 10-game winning streak, to earn the top Wild Card spot only to lose the [[2013 American League Wild Card Game|AL Wild Card Game]] to the [[2013 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]].
*In {{by|2016}}, the Indians won their first [[2016 American League Championship Series|AL pennant]] in 19 seasons, but lost the [[2016 World Series|World Series]] to the [[2016 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] (who ended [[Curse of the Billy Goat|their own curse]]) after leading the best-of-seven series 3–1.
*In {{by|2017}}, the Indians finished {{win-loss record|w=102|l=60}} and won the AL Central. During the season they won 22 games in a row, the [[List of Major League Baseball longest winning streaks|longest winning streak]] in American League history. They won the first two games against the [[2017 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in the [[2017 American League Division Series|ALDS]], and then lost the next three, ending their season.
*In {{by|2018}}, the Indians went 91–71 to easily win the AL Central. They were then swept by the Astros 3–0 in the ALDS.

[[File:Greek statue discus thrower 2 century aC.jpg|thumb|Roman bronze reduction of Myron's ''Discobolus'', 2nd century AD ([[Glyptothek]], Munich)]]
[[File:Diskoskasteren (Discobolos) - KAS1549.stl|thumb|3D model of a replica at [[Statens Museum for Kunst]], Denmark.]]
The '''''Discobolus''''' of [[Myron]] ("[[discus thrower]]", {{lang-el|Δισκοβόλος}}, ''Diskobólos'') is a Greek [[sculpture]] completed at the start of the Classical Period, figuring a youthful ancient Greek athlete throwing discus, circa 460–450&amp;nbsp;BC. The original Greek bronze is lost but the work is known through numerous Roman copies, both full-scale ones in marble, which was cheaper than bronze,&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;Woodford, Susan. (1982) ''The Art of Greece and Rome''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], p. 16. {{ISBN|0521298733}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the first to be recovered, the ''Palombara Discobolus'', and smaller scaled versions in bronze.

A discus thrower depicted is about to release his throw: "by sheer intelligence", [[Kenneth Clark]] observed in ''The Nude'', "Myron has created the enduring pattern of athletic energy. He has taken a moment of action so transitory that students of athletics still debate if it is feasible, and he has given it the completeness of a [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]]."&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;[[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]]. (2010) ''The Nude: A study in ideal form''. New edition. London: [[The Folio Society]], pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; The moment thus captured in the statue is an example of ''rhythmos'', harmony and balance. Myron is often credited with being the first sculptor to master this style. Naturally, as always in Greek athletics, the ''Discobolus'' is completely nude. His pose is said to be unnatural to a human, and today considered a rather inefficient way to throw the discus.&lt;ref&gt;An explanation for his inefficient discus throwing could be that the ancient Olympic sportsmen had a set rotation of three quarters before the discus was thrown. This rotation could well have been a deliberate handicap to make the sport more difficult.&lt;/ref&gt; Also there is very little emotion shown in the discus thrower's face, and "to a modern eye, it may seem that Myron's desire for perfection has made him suppress too rigorously the sense of strain in the individual muscles,"&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; Clark observes. The other trademark of Myron embodied in this sculpture is how well the body is proportioned, the ''symmetria''.

The potential energy expressed in this sculpture's tightly wound pose, expressing the moment of stasis just before the release, is an example of the advancement of Classical sculpture from Archaic. The torso shows no muscular strain, however, even though the limbs are outflung.

== Reputation in the past ==
[[File:Discobolus red figure Louvre G292 full.jpg|thumb|right|The ''discobolus'' motif on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figured cup, ca. 490 BC, is static by comparison.]]
[[File:Discobolo-stabiae.JPG|thumb|Roman [[discus thrower]] from [[Stabiae]], Villa Arianna, 1st century AD]]
[[Myron]]'s ''Discobolus'' was long known from descriptions, such as the dialogue in [[Lucian of Samosata]]'s work ''[[Philopseudes]]'':

{{quote|"When you came into the hall," he said, "didn't you notice a totally gorgeous statue up there, by Demetrios the portraitist?" "Surely you don't mean the discus-thrower," said I, "the one bent over into the throwing-position, with his head turned back to the hand that holds the discus, and the opposite knee slightly flexed, like one who will spring up again after the throw?"

"Not that one," he said, "that's one of [[Myron]]'s works, that Diskobolos you speak of..."
|[[Lucian of Samosata]], ''Philopseudes''  c. 18&lt;ref&gt;The Lucian reference and [[Quintillian]], ii.13.xviii-x, are noted by {{Harvnb|Haskell|Penny|1981|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==''Discobolus'' and ''Discophorus''==
Prior to this statue's discovery the term ''Discobolus'' had been applied in the 17th and 18th centuries to a standing figure holding a discus, a ''[[Discophoros]]'', which [[Ennio Quirino Visconti]] identified as the ''Discobolus'' of [[Naukydes of Argos]], mentioned by [[Pliny's Natural History|Pliny]] (Haskell and Penny 1981:200).

== ''Discobolus Palombara'' or ''Lancellotti'' ==
The ''Discobolus Palombara'', the first copy of this famous sculpture to have been discovered, was found in 1781. It is a 1st-century AD copy of [[Myron]]'s original bronze. Following its discovery at a Roman property of the Massimo family, the Villa Palombara on the [[Esquiline Hill]], it was initially restored by Giuseppe Angelini; the Massimi installed it initially in their [[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]] and then at [[Palazzo Lancellotti]]. The Italian archaeologist [[Giovanni Battista Visconti]] identified the sculpture as a copy from the original of [[Myron]]. It was instantly famous, though the Massimo jealously guarded access to it (Haskell and Penny 1981:200).

In 1937 [[Adolf Hitler]] negotiated to buy it, and eventually succeeded in 1938, when [[Galeazzo Ciano]], Minister of Foreign Affairs, sold it to him for five million lire, over the protests of [[Giuseppe Bottai]], Minister of Education, and the scholarly community. It was shipped by rail to Munich and displayed in the [[Glyptothek]]; it was returned in 1948. It is now in the [[National Museum of Rome]], displayed at the [[Palazzo Massimo]].

== ''Townley Discobolus'' ==
[[File:Discobulus.jpg|thumb|The Townley ''Discobolus'' at the [[British Museum]], Roman copy with incorrectly restored head.]]

After the discovery of the ''Discobolus Palombara'' a second notable ''Discobolus'' was excavated, at [[Hadrian's Villa]] in 1790, and was purchased by the English antiquary and art dealer established in Rome, [[Thomas Jenkins (antiquary)|Thomas Jenkins]], at [[public auction]] in 1792. (Another example, also found at Tivoli at this date, was acquired by the [[Vatican Museums]].) The English connoisseur [[Charles Towneley|Charles Townley]] paid Jenkins £400 for the statue, which arrived at the semi-public gallery Townley commissioned in Park Street, London, in 1794. The head was wrongly restored, as [[Richard Payne Knight]] soon pointed out, but Townley was convinced his was the original and better copy.

It was bought for the [[British Museum]], with the rest of Townley's marbles, in July 1805.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Kitto, "The celebrated connoisseur: Charles Townley, 1737-1805" ''Minerva Magazine'' May/June 2005, in connection with a British Museum exhibition celebrating the bicentennial of the Townley purchase. [http://www.burnley.gov.uk/towneley/whatson/charles_towneley/Townley_Marbles_v1.pdf]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other copies ==
[[File:Discobolus in National Roman Museum Palazzo Massimo alle Terme.JPG|thumb|A Discobolus in the National Roman Museum in Palazzo Massimo alle Terme.]]
Other Roman copies in [[marble]] have been recovered, and torsos that were already known in the 17th century but that had been wrongly restored and completed, have since been identified as further repetitions after Myron's model. For one such example, in the early 18th century [[Pierre-Étienne Monnot]] restored a torso that is now recognized as an example of Myron's ''Discobolus'' as a ''Wounded Gladiator'' who supports himself on his arm as he sinks to the ground; the completed sculpture was donated before 1734 by [[Pope Clement XII]] to the [[Capitoline Museums]], where it remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Francis |last=Haskell |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Nicholas |last2=Penny |year=1981 |title=Taste and the Antique: the Lure of Classical Sculpture 1500-1900 |publisher=Yale University Press, pp. 200 &amp; 227. |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-02641-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another copy was discovered in 1906 in the ruins of a [[Roman villa]] at Tor Paterno in the former royal estate of Castel Porziano, now also conserved in the [[Museo Nazionale Romano]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clark illustrated it in the 1956 edition of ''The Nude'', fig. 130, p.241, as "after [[Myron]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century plaster copies of the Discobolos could be found in many large academic collections, now mostly dispersed.

[[File:Gilded frame being burnished with agate tool.jpg|thumb|right|Gilded frame ready for [[burnishing (metal)|burnishing]] with agate stone tool]]
[[File:Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Layer for Layer.ogv|thumb|right|Application of gold leaf to a reproduction of a 15th-century panel painting]]
'''Gilding''' is any decorative technique for applying a very thin coating of gold to solid surfaces such as metal (much the most common), wood, [[porcelain]], or stone. A gilded object is also described as "gilt". Where metal is gilded, it was traditionally [[silver]] in the West, to make [[silver-gilt]] (or ''[[vermeil]]'') objects, but [[gilt-bronze]] is commonly used in China, and also called [[ormolu]] if it is Western.  Methods of gilding include hand application and gluing, typically of [[gold leaf]], chemical gilding, and [[electroplating]], the last also called [[gold plating]].&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, Annie (1996) ''Decorative Gilding'', Collins &amp; Brown, {{ISBN|978-0-89577-879-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Parcel-gilt''' (partial gilt) objects are only gilded over part of their surfaces. This may mean that all of the inside, and none of the outside, of a [[chalice]] or similar vessel is gilded, or that patterns or images are made up by using a combination of gilt and ungilted areas.

Gilding gives an object a gold appearance at a fraction of the cost of creating a solid gold object. In addition, a solid gold piece would often be too soft or too heavy for practical use. A gilt surface also does not tarnish as silver does.

==Origins and spread==
[[Image:Vajrasattva Tibet.jpg|thumb|A gilded Tibetan [[Vajrasattva]]]]
[[Herodotus]] mentions that the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]s gilded wood and metals, and many such objects have been excavated. Certain Ancient Greek statues of great prestige were [[Chryselephantine sculpture|chryselephantine]], i.e., made of gold (for the clothing) and [[ivory]] (for the flesh); these however, were constructed with sheets of gold over a timber framework, not gilded. Extensive ornamental gilding was also used in the ceiling coffers of the [[Propylaea]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] informs us that the first gilding seen at [[Rome]] was after the destruction of [[Carthage]], under the censorship of [[Lucius Mummius]], when the Romans began to gild the ceilings of their temples and palaces, the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]] being the first place on which this process was used. But he adds that luxury advanced on them so rapidly that in very little time you might see all, even private and poor people, gild the walls, vaults, and other parts of their dwellings. Owing to the comparative thickness of the gold leaf used in ancient gilding, the traces of it that remain are remarkably brilliant and solid. Fire-gilding of metal goes back at least to the 4th century BC, and was known to Pliny (33,20,64–5), [[Vitruvius]] (8,8,4) and in the Early Mediaeval period to Theophilus (De Diversis Artibus Book III).

In Europe, silver-gilt has always been more common than gilt-bronze, but in China the opposite has been the case. The ancient Chinese also developed the gilding of [[porcelain]], which was later taken up by the French and other European potters.

==Processes==
Modern gilding is applied to numerous and diverse surfaces and by various processes; those used in modern technology are described in [[gold plating]]. More traditional techniques still form an important part of [[Picture frame|framemaking]] and are sometimes still employed in general [[woodworking]], [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]]-work, decorative painting and [[interior decoration]], [[bookbinding]], and ornamental [[leather]] work, and in the decoration of [[pottery]], porcelain, and [[glass]].

===Mechanical gilding===
[[File:Gilding Rock Cen Prometheus jeh.jpg|thumb|right|Regilding the statue ''[[Prometheus (Manship)|Prometheus]]'']]
[[File:Old book with gilded page edges.JPG|thumb|Gilded page edges on a book.]]
Mechanical gilding includes all the operations in which gold leaf is prepared, and the processes to mechanically attach the gold onto surfaces. The techniques include [[burnishing (metal)|burnishing]], water gilding and oil-gilding used by wood carvers and gilders; and the gilding operations of the house decorator, sign painter, [[bookbinder]], the paper stainer and several others.

Polished iron, steel and other metals are gilded mechanically by applying gold leaf to the metallic surface at a temperature just under red-hot, pressing the leaf on with a burnisher, then reheating when additional leaf may be laid on. The process is completed by cold burnishing.

"Overlaying" or folding or hammering on gold foil or gold leaf is the simplest and most ancient method, and is mentioned in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]] (Bk vi, 232)&lt;ref&gt;"And as when a man overlays silver with gold, a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athena have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is the work he produces, even so the goddess shed grace upon his head and shoulders" from [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136;query=card%3D%2368;layout=;loc=6.162 this translation]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Old Testament]]. The ''[[Ram in a Thicket]]'' of about 2600–2400 BCE from [[Ur]] uses this technique on wood, with a thin layer of [[bitumen]] underneath to help adhesion.

The next advances involved two simple processes. The first involves gold leaf, which is gold that is hammered or cut into very thin sheets. Gold leaf is often thinner than standard paper today, and when held to the light is semi-transparent. In ancient times it was typically about ten times thicker than today, and perhaps half that in the [[Middle Ages]].

If gilding on canvas or on wood, the surface was often first coated with [[gesso]]. "Gesso" is a substance made of finely ground [[gypsum]] or chalk mixed with glue. Once the coating of gesso had been applied, allowed to dry, and smoothed, it was re-wet with a [[sizing]] made of [[rabbit-skin glue]] and water ("water gilding", which allows the surface to be subsequently burnished to a mirror-like finish) or boiled [[linseed oil]] mixed with [[litharge]] ("oil gilding", which does not) and the gold leaf was layered on and left to dry. Those gilding on canvas and parchment also sometimes employed stiffly-beaten egg whites ("glair"), [[Gum (botany)|gum]], and/or [[Armenian bole]] as sizing, though egg whites and gum both become brittle over time, causing the gold leaf to crack and detach, and so honey was sometimes added to make them more flexible.

Other gilding processes involved using the gold as pigment in paint: the artist ground the gold into a fine powder and mixed it with a binder. Then the gold was applied in the same way as with any paint. Sometimes, after either gold-leafing or gold-painting, the artist would heat the piece enough to melt the gold slightly, ensuring an even coat. These techniques remained the only alternatives for materials like wood, leather, the vellum pages of [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and gilt-edged stock.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

===Chemical gilding===
[[File:Johann Jacob Kirstein 001.JPG|thumb|Silver gilt ''toilette'' set by Johann Jacob Kirstein (1733–1816) in the [[Musée des Arts décoratifs, Strasbourg]]]]
Chemical gilding embraces those processes in which the gold is at some stage of chemical combination. These include:

====Cold gilding====
In this process the gold is obtained in a state of extremely fine division, and applied by mechanical means. Cold gilding on silver is performed by a solution of gold in [[aqua regia]], applied by dipping a linen rag into the solution, burning it, and rubbing the black and heavy ashes on the silver with the finger or a piece of leather or cork.

====Wet gilding====
''Wet gilding'' is effected by means of a dilute solution of [[gold(III) chloride]] in aqua regia with twice its quantity of [[diethyl ether|ether]]. The liquids are agitated and allowed to rest, to allow the ether to separate and float on the surface of the acid. The whole mixture is then poured into a separating funnel with a small aperture, and allowed to rest for some time, when the acid is run off from below and the gold dissolved in ether separated. The ether will be found to have taken up all the gold from the acid, and may be used for gilding iron or steel, for which purpose the metal is polished with fine emery and [[spirits of wine]]. The ether is then applied with a small brush, and as it evaporates it deposits the gold, which can now be heated and polished. For small delicate figures, a pen or a fine brush may be used for laying on the ether solution. The gold(III) chloride can also be dissolved in water in [[Electroplating#Electroless deposition|electroless plating]] wherein the gold is slowly reduced out of solution onto the surface to be gilded. When this technique is used on the second surface of glass and backed with silver, it is known as "[[Angel gilding]]".

====Fire-gilding====
''Fire-gilding'' or ''Wash-gilding'' is a process by which an [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] of gold is applied to metallic surfaces, the [[mercury (element)|mercury]] being subsequently [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatilized]], leaving a film of gold or an amalgam containing 13 to 16% mercury. In the preparation of the amalgam, the gold must first be reduced to thin plates or grains, which are heated red-hot, and thrown into previously heated mercury, until it begins to smoke. When the mixture is stirred with an iron rod, the gold is totally absorbed. The proportion of mercury to gold is generally six or eight to one. When the amalgam is cold, it is squeezed through [[chamois leather]] to separate the superfluous mercury; the gold, with about twice its weight of mercury, remains behind, forming a yellowish silvery mass with the consistency of butter.

When the metal to be gilded is wrought or chased, it ought to be covered with mercury before the amalgam is applied, that this may be more easily spread; but when the surface of the metal is plain, the amalgam may be applied to it directly. When no such preparation is applied, the surface to be gilded is simply bitten and cleaned with [[nitric acid]]. A deposit of mercury is obtained on a metallic surface by means of quicksilver water, a solution of [[mercury(II) nitrate]], the nitric acid attacking the metal to which it is applied, and thus leaving a film of free metallic mercury.

The amalgam being equally spread over the prepared surface of the metal, the mercury is then [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimed]] by a heat just sufficient for that purpose; for, if it is too great, part of the gold may be driven off, or it may run together and leave some of the surface of the metal bare. When the mercury has evaporated, which is known by the surface having entirely become of a dull yellow color, the metal must undergo other operations, by which the fine gold color is given to it. First, the gilded surface is rubbed with a scratch brush of [[brass]] wire, until its surface is smooth.

It is then covered with ''gilding wax'', and again exposed to fire until the wax is burnt off. Gilding wax is composed of [[beeswax]] mixed with some of the following substances: [[red ochre]], [[verdigris]], copper scales, [[alum]], [[vitriol]], and [[borax]]. By this operation the color of the gilding is heightened, and the effect seems to be produced by a perfect dissipation of some mercury remaining after the former operation. The gilt surface is then covered over with [[potassium nitrate]], alum or other salts, ground together, and mixed into a [[paste (rheology)|paste]] with water or weak [[ammonia]]. The piece of metal thus covered is exposed to heat, and then [[quenching|quenched]] in water.

By this method, its color is further improved and brought nearer to that of gold, probably by removing any particles of copper that may have been on the gilt surface. This process, when skillfully carried out, produces gilding of great solidity and beauty, but owing to the exposure of the workmen to mercurial fumes, it is very unhealthy. There is also much loss of mercury to the atmosphere, which brings extremely serious environmental concerns as well.

This method of gilding metallic objects was formerly widespread, but fell into disuse as the dangers of [[mercury toxicity]] became known. Since fire-gilding requires that the mercury be volatilized to drive off the mercury and leave the gold behind on the surface, it is extremely dangerous. Breathing the fumes generated by this process can quickly result in serious health problems, such as [[neurology|neurological damage]] and [[endocrinology|endocrine disorders]], since inhalation is a very efficient route for mercuric compounds to enter the body. This process has generally been supplanted by the electroplating of gold over a [[nickel]] [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]], which is more economical and less dangerous.

====Depletion gilding====
{{Main|Depletion gilding}}
In depletion gilding, a subtractive process discovered in [[Pre-columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], articles are fabricated by various techniques from an alloy of copper and gold, named [[tumbaga]] by the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spaniards]]. The surface is etched with acids, resulting in a surface of porous gold. The porous surface is then [[Burnishing (metal)|burnished]] down, resulting in a shiny gold surface. The results fooled the [[conquistadors]] into thinking they had massive quantities of pure gold. The results startled modern [[archaeology|archaeologists]], because at first the pieces resemble electroplated articles. [[Keum-boo]] is a special [[Koreans|Korean]] technique of silver-gilding, using [[depletion gilding]].

===Ceramics===

The gilding of decorative [[ceramic art|ceramics]] has been undertaken for centuries, with the permanence and brightness of gold appealing to designers. Both porcelain and [[earthenware]] are commonly decorated with gold, and in the late 1970s it was reported that 5 tonnes of gold were used annually for the decoration of these products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF03215112|title=Gold in the pottery industry|journal=Gold Bulletin|volume=12|issue=3|pages=116|year=1979|last1=Hunt|first1=L.

The most important factors affecting coating quality are the composition of applied gold, the state of the surface before application, the thickness of the layer and the firing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF00676649|title=Improving gold decorating techniques|journal=Glass and Ceramics|volume=48|issue=11|pages=535|year=1991|last1=Gerasimova|first1=L. V.|last2=Ivanova|first2=V. M.|last3=Peskova|first3=E. Yu.|last4=Druzhinin|first4=E. V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of different forms and compositions are available to apply gold to ceramic, and these include:&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, A.and Murfin, D. (1994) ''Dictionary Of Ceramics''. The Institute Of Minerals.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF03180905|title=Liquid gold and other components used in decoration of glazed porcelain and glass articles|journal=Glass and Ceramics|volume=55|issue=3–4|pages=98|year=1998|last1=Rovinskaya|first1=N. V.|last2=Lapitskaya|first2=E. V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Acid-etched gilding – developed in 1860s at [[Mintons]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]], and patented in 1863. The glazed surface, usually a narrow border, is [[transfer printing|transfer printed]] with a wax-like resist, after which the glaze is etched with dilute [[hydrofluoric acid]] prior to application of the gold, after which the design's raised elements are selectively burnished to give a bright and matte surface; the process demands great skill and is used for the decoration only of ware of the highest class.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Hayward (ed.) (1960) ''The Connoisseur’s Handbook of Antique Collecting''. Galahad Books, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bright Gold or Liquid Gold is a solution of gold sulphoresinate together with other metal resinates and a bismuth-based flux. It is particularly bright when drawn from the decorating kiln and so needs little further processing. This form of gilding was invented or at least improved by [[Heinrich Roessler]]. Rhodium compounds are used to improve the binding to the substrate.
*Burnish Gold or Best Gold is applied to the ware as a suspension of gold powder in essential oils mixed with lead borosilicate or a bismuth-based flux. This type of gold decoration is dull as taken from the kiln and requires burnishing, usually with agate, to bring out the colour. As the name suggests it is considered the highest quality of gold decoration. One [[solvent]]-free burnish gold composition was reported to consist of 10 to 40% gold powder, 2 to 20% [[polyvinylpyrrolidone]], 3 to 30% an aqueous acrylate resin and 5 to 50% water.&lt;ref&gt;"Burnish Gold Decorating Composition."

{{Governance}}
'''Governance''' comprises all of the processes of governing - whether undertaken by the [[government]] of a [[state (polity) | state]], by a [[market (economics) |market]] or by a [[social network| network]] - over a [[social system]] ([[family]], [[tribe]], [[formal organization |formal]] or [[informal organization]], a [[territory]] or across territories) and whether through the [[laws]], [[norm (social) |norm]]s, [[political power|power]] or [[language]] of an organized society.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite book |last= Bevir |first= Mark |title= Governance: A very short introduction |year= 2012 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford, UK | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ozjcWIfhoO8C | quote = Governance refers, therefore, to all processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, market, or network, whether over a family, tribe, formal or informal organization, or territory, and whether through laws, norms, power or language. Governance differs from government in that it focuses less on the state and its institutions and more on social practices and activities. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It relates to "the processes of interaction and decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem that lead to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of [[social norm]]s and [[institution]]s".&lt;ref name="Hufty 2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In lay terms, it could be described as the political processes that exist in and between formal institutions.

A variety of entities (known generically as '''governing bodies''') can govern. The most formal is a '''government''', a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a given [[geopolitical]] system (such as a [[sovereign state|state]]) by establishing [[law]]s. Other types of governing include an organization (such as a [[corporation]] recognized as a legal entity by a government), a socio-political group ([[chiefdom]], tribe, [[gang]], family, [[religious denomination]], etc.), or another, informal [[social group | group]] of people. In [[business sector | business]] and [[outsourcing]] relationships, [[Governance Frameworks|governance frameworks]] are built{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} into [[relational contract]]s that foster long-term collaboration and innovation.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Governance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained, regulated and held [[accountability |accountable]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} The degree of formality depends on the internal rules of a given [[organization]] and, externally, with its [[business partner]]s. As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results. For instance, a government may operate as a [[democracy]] where citizens vote on who should govern and the [[public good]] is the goal, while a [[non-profit organization]] or a [[corporation]] may be governed by a small [[board of directors]] and pursue more specific aims.

In addition, a variety of external actors without decision-making power can influence the process of governing. These include [[lobbying |lobbies]], [[think tanks]], [[political parties]], [[non-government organizations]] , community and [[Media (communication) | media]].

==Origin of the word==
{{Disputed section|Origins of the word|date=August 2016}}
Like ''government'', the word ''governance'' derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb kubernaein [''kubernáo''] (meaning ''to steer'', the metaphorical sense first being attested in [[Plato]]). Its occasional use in English to refer to the specific activity of ruling a country can be traced to early modern England, when the phrase "governance of the realm" appears in works by [[William Tyndale]]&lt;ref name="TyndaleFrith1831"&gt;"When the king's grace came first to the right of the crown, and unto the governance of the realm young and unexpert..." {{cite book|author1=William Tyndale|author2=John Frith|title=The works of Tyndale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qoMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA452|year=1831|publisher=Ebenezer Palmer|page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in royal correspondence between [[James V of Scotland]] and [[Henry VIII of England]].&lt;ref&gt;"We have put all our confidence, has als actyflie with ye help of our derrest Modir takin on Ws ye governance of our Realme": {{cite book|title=State Papers: King Henry the Eighth; Part IV.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs0_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA95|year=1836|publisher=Murray|page=95|chapter=Letter of James V to Henry VIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first usage in connection with institutional structures (as distinct from individual rule) is in [[Charles Plummer]]’s ''The Governance of England'' (an 1885 translation from a 15th-century Latin work by [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], also known as ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy''). This usage of governance to refer to the arrangements of governing became orthodox including in [[Sidney Low]]’s seminal text of the same title in 1904 and among some later British constitutional historians.

However, the use of the term ''governance'' in its current broader sense, encompassing the activities of a wide range of public and private institutions, acquired general currency only as recently as the 1990s, when it was re-minted by economists and political scientists and disseminated by institutions such as the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/governance/docs/doc5_fr.pdf Étymologie du terme "gouvernance"], document prepared by the [[European Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term has steadily gained increasing usage.

==Types==
Governance often refers to a particular 'level' of governance associated with a type of organization (including public governance, global governance, non-profit governance, corporate governance, and project governance), a particular 'field' of governance associated with a type of activity or outcome (including environmental governance, internet governance, and information technology governance), or a particular 'model' of governance, often derived as an empirical or normative theory (including regulatory governance, participatory governance, multilevel governance, metagovernance, and collaborative governance).

Governance can also define normative or practical agendas. Normative concepts of fair governance or good governance are common among [[Politics|political]], [[public sector]], [[Volunteering|voluntary]], and [[private sector]] organizations.

===Governance as process===
{{Unreferenced section|date = December 2013}}In its most abstract sense, governance is a theoretical concept referring to the actions and processes by which stable practices and organizations arise and persist. These actions and processes may operate in formal and informal organizations of any size; and they may function for any purpose, good or evil, for profit or not. Conceiving of governance in this way, one can apply the concept to [[State (polity)|states]], to [[corporation]]s, to [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]]s, to [[NGO]]s, to partnerships and other associations, to business relationships (especially complex [[outsourcing]] relationships), to [[project team]]s, and to any number of humans engaged in some purposeful activity.

Most theories of governance as process arose out of [[neoclassical economics]]. These theories build deductive models, based on the assumptions of modern economics, to show how rational actors may come to establish and sustain formal organizations, including firms and states, and informal organizations, such as networks and practices for governing the commons. Many of these theories draw on [[transaction cost]] economics.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," ''Journal of Law and Economics'': Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public governance===
{{main|Public administration}}
There is a distinction between the concepts of governance and [[politics]]. Politics involves processes by which a group of people (perhaps with divergent opinions or interests) reach collective decisions generally regarded as binding on the group, and enforced as common [[policy]]. Governance, on the other hand, conveys the [[Public administration|administrative]] and process-oriented elements of governing rather than its antagonistic ones.&lt;ref&gt;Offe, Claus, (2009) Governance: An “Empty Signifier”? ''Constellations,'' 16: 550–62. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-8675.2009.00570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an argument continues to assume the possibility of the traditional separation between "politics" and "administration". Contemporary governance practice and theory sometimes questions this distinction, premising that both "governance" and "politics" involve aspects of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[accountability]].

In general terms, public governance occurs in three broad ways:
* Through networks involving [[public-private partnership]]s (PPP) or with the collaboration of community organisations;
* Through the use of [[Market (economics)|market]] mechanisms whereby market principles of competition serve to allocate resources while operating under government regulation;
* Through top-down methods that primarily involve governments and the state [[bureaucracy]].

===Private governance===
Private governance occurs when non-governmental entities, including private organizations, [[dispute resolution organizations]], or other third party groups, make rules and/or standards which have a binding effect on the "quality of life and opportunities of the larger public."  Simply put, private—not public—entities are making [[public policy]]. For example, insurance companies exert a great societal impact, largely invisible and freely accepted, that is a private form of governance in society; in turn, reinsurers, as private companies, may exert similar private governance over their underlying carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Marcos Antonio Mendoza, "Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions", 21 Conn. Ins. L.J. 53, 68–70 (2014) http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2573253&lt;/ref&gt; The term "public policy" should not be exclusively associated with policy that is made by [[government]]. Public policy may be created by either the private sector or the public sector. If one wishes to refer only to public policy that is made by government, the best term to use is "governmental policy," which eliminates the ambiguity regarding the agent of the policy making.

===Global governance===
{{main|Global governance}}
Global governance is defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, right and obligations are established, and differences are mediated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thakur|first1=Ramesh|last2=Van Langenhove|first2=Luk|title=Enhancing Global Governance through Regional Integration|journal=Global Governance|date=2006|volume=12|issue=3 July, September|pages=233–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the traditional meaning of "governance", some authors like [[James Rosenau]] have used the term "global governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority.&lt;ref&gt;James N. Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance", in Martin Hewson and Thomas Sinclair, eds., ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'', SUNY Press, Albany, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The best example of this is the international system or relationships between independent states. The term, however, can apply wherever a group of free equals needs to form a regular relationship.

===Governance Analytical Framework===
The Governance Analytical Framework (GAF) is a practical methodology for investigating governance processes, where various stakeholders interact and make decisions regarding collective issues, thus creating or reinforcing social norms and institutions. It is postulated that governance processes can be found in any society, and unlike other approaches, that these can be observed and analysed from a non-[[normative]] perspective. It proposes a methodology based on five main analytical units: problems, actors, norms, processes and "nodal points". These logically articulated analytical units make up a coherent methodology aimed at being used as a tool for empirical [[social policy]] research.&lt;ref name="Hufty 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hufty |first=Marc |title=Governance: Exploring four approaches and their relevance to research. In: Wiesmann, U., Hurni, H., et al. editors. Research for Sustainable Development: Foundations, Experiences, and Perspectives. |year=2011 |location=Bern |publisher=Geographica Bernensia: 165–183.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spear, Cornforth &amp; Aiken, 2009. The governance challenges of social enterprises: Evidence from a UK empirical study. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 89(2): 247–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonprofit governance===
Nonprofit governance has a dual focus: achieving the organization's social mission and the ensuring the organization is viable. Both responsibilities relate to fiduciary responsibility that a board of trustees (sometimes called directors, or Board, or Management Committee—the terms are interchangeable) has with respect to the exercise of authority over the explicit actions the organization takes. Public trust and accountability is an essential aspect of organizational viability so it achieves the social mission in a way that is respected by those whom the organization serves and the society in which it is located.

===Corporate governance===
{{main|Corporate governance}}
[[Corporation|Corporate organizations]] often use the word ''governance'' to describe both:
# The manner in which [[Board of directors|board]]s or their like direct a corporation
# The laws and customs (rules) applying to that direction

Corporate governance consists of the set of processes, customs, policies, laws and institutions affecting the way people direct, administer or control a corporation. Corporate governance also includes the relationships among the many players involved (the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]) and the corporate [[goal]]s. The principal players include the [[shareholder]]s, [[management]], and the [[board of directors]]. Other stakeholders include employees, suppliers, customers, banks and other lenders, regulators, the environment and the community at large.

The first documented use of the word "corporate governance" is by Richard Eells (1960, p.&amp;nbsp;108) to denote "the structure and functioning of the corporate polity". The "corporate government" concept itself is older and was already used in finance textbooks at the beginning of the 20th century (Becht, Bolton, Röell 2004).

===Project governance===

===Land governance===
Land governance is concerned with issues of land ownership and tenure. It consists of the policies, processes and institutions by which decisions about the access to, use of and control over land are made, implemented and enforced; it is also about managing and reconciling competing claims on land. In developing countries, it is relevant as a tool to contribute to equitable and sustainable development, addressing the phenomenon that is known as ‘[[land grabbing]]’.&lt;ref&gt;Focus on Land in Africa (http://www.focusonland.com/property-rights-issues/land-governance-and-law-1/)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/335807-1194987153844/UNHABITATFricska.ppt Policy Paper: Good Land Governance]. Global Land Tool Network, no date.&lt;/ref&gt; The operational dimension of land governance is [[land administration]].

Security of land tenure is considered to contribute to poverty reduction and food security, since it can enable farmers to fully participate in the economy. Without recognized property rights, it is hard for small entrepreneurs, farmers included, to obtain credit or sell their business&lt;ref&gt;[[Hernando de Soto Polar|De Soto, Hernando]]. [http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465016150 The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else]. New York: Basic Books. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; - hence the relevance of comprehensive land governance.

There is constant feedback between land tenure problems and land governance.  For instance, it has been argued that what is frequently called '[[land grabbing]]', was partly made possible by the [[Washington Consensus]]-inspired liberalization of land markets in developing countries. Many land acquisition deals were perceived to have negative consequences, and this in turn led to initiatives to improve land governance in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Mayke Kaag and Annelies Zoomers: [https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/the-global-land-grab/ The global land grab: beyond the hype], Zed Books, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of land governance depends on its practical implementation, which is known as [[land administration]]: ‘the way in which rules of land tenure are made operational’. And another factor is accountability:  the degree to which citizens and stakeholder groups are consulted and can hold to account their authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Mayke Kaag and Annelies Zoomers, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main international policy initiative to improve land governance is known as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (VGGT),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/ VGGT]&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by the [[Committee on World Food Security]] (CFS).

===Internet governance===
{{main|Internet governance}}

===Information technology governance===
{{main|Information technology governance}}
IT governance primarily deals with connections between business focus and IT management. The goal of clear governance is to assure the investment in IT generate business value and mitigate the risks that are associated with IT projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Smallwood | first= Deb | work= Tech Decision CIO Insights | title = IT Governance: A Simple Model | date = March 2009 | url = http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/insurance/2009/02/it_governance_a_simple_model.php
| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory governance===
{{main|Regulatory governance}}
Regulatory governance reflects the emergence of decentered and mutually adaptive policy regimes which rests on regulation rather than service provision or taxing and spending.&lt;ref&gt;David Levi-Faur, "Regulation &amp; Regulatory Governance", in David Levi-Faur, Handbook on the Politics of Regulation, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2011, pp. 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The term captures the tendency of policy regimes to deal with complexity with delegated system of rules. It is likely to appear in arenas and nations which are more complex, more global, more contested and more liberally democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Braithwaite, John, Cary Coglianese, and David Levi‐Faur. "Can regulation and governance make a difference?." Regulation &amp; Governance 1.1 (2007): 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The term builds upon and extends the terms of the regulatory state on the one hand and governance on the other. While the term regulatory state marginalize non-state actors (NGOs and Business) in the domestic and global level, the term governance marginalizes regulation as a constitutive instrument of governance. The term regulatory governance therefore allows us to understand governance beyond the state and governance via regulation.

===Participatory governance===
Participatory governance focuses on deepening democratic engagement through the participation of citizens in the processes of governance with the state. The idea is that citizens should play a more direct roles in public decision-making or at least engage more deeply with political issues. Government officials should also be responsive to this kind of engagement. In practice, participatory governance can supplement the roles of citizens as voters or as watchdogs through more direct forms of involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/triumph-deficit-or-contestation-deepening-the-deepening-democracy-debate 'Triumph, Deficit or Contestation? Deepening the 'Deepening Democracy' Debate'] Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Working Paper 264 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contract governance===
(See also [[contract management]].) Emerging thinking about contract governance is focusing on creating a governance structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex contractual arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way.&lt;ref&gt;Unpacking Outsourcing Governance: How to Build a Sound Governance Structure to Drive Insight Versus Oversight|[http://www.vestedway.com/vested-library/]|2015|Vested Way|accessed 17 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson wrote that the governance structure for a contract is the “framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided.” Adding further that “because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.”&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," Journal of Law and Economics: Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multilevel governance===
{{main|Multilevel governance}}

===Metagovernance===
"Metagovernance" is the "governing of governing".&lt;ref&gt;Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the established ethical principles, or 'norms', that shape and steer the entire governing process. It is important to note that there are no clearly defined settings within which metagoverning takes place, or particular persons who are responsible for it. While some{{Who|date=January 2012}} believe metagoverning to be the role of the state which is assumed to want to steer actors in a particular direction, it can "potentially be exercised by any resourceful actor"&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, E. Metagovernance: The Changing Role of Politicians in Processes of Democratic Governance. ''American Review of Public Administration.'' Volume 36 2006, pp. 98–114 (p. 103).&lt;/ref&gt; who wishes to influence the governing process. Examples of this include the publishing of codes of conduct at the highest level of international government,&lt;ref&gt;Onyango, P &amp; Jentoft, S. Assessing Poverty in small-scale fisheries in Lake Victoria, Tanzania.''Fish and Fisheries''. Volume 11 2010, pp. 250–63 (p. 258).&lt;/ref&gt; and media focus on specific issues&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;Evans, J. ''Environmental Governance''. Routledge 2012. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; at the socio-cultural level. Despite their different sources, both seek to establish values in such a way that they become accepted 'norms'. The fact that 'norms' can be established at any level and can then be used to shape the governance process as whole, means metagovernance is part of both the input and the output of the governing system.&lt;ref&gt;Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborative governance===
{{See also|Collaborative governance}}
A collaborative governance framework uses a relationship management structure, joint performance and transformation management processes and an exit management plan as controlling mechanisms to encourage the organizations to make ethical, proactive changes for the mutual benefit of all the parties.&lt;ref name="Vitasek"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitasek|first=Kate|display-authors=etal |title=The Vested Outsourcing Manual|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0230112684|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security sector governance ===
{{See also|Security sector governance}}Security sector governance (SSG) is a subpart concept or framework of security governance that focuses specifically on decisions about [[security]] and their implementation within the [[National security|security sector]] of a single state. SSG applies the principles of [[good governance]] to the security sector in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dcaf.ch|title=Security Sector Governance|last=|first=|publisher=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|year=2015|isbn=|series=SSR Backgrounder Series|location=Geneva|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a normative concept==

===Fair governance===

When discussing governance in particular organizations, the quality of governance within the organization is often compared to a standard of [[good governance]]. In the case of a [[business]] or of a [[non-profit organization]], for example, good governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, guidance, processes and decision-rights for a given area of responsibility, and proper oversight and accountability. "Good governance" implies that mechanisms function in a way that allows the executives (the "agents") to respect the rights and interests of the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (the "principals"), in a spirit of [[democracy]].

===Good governance===
{{Main|Good governance}}
Good governance is an indeterminate term used in international development literature to describe various normative accounts of how public institutions ought to conduct public affairs and manage public resources. These normative accounts are often justified on the grounds that they are thought to be conducive to economic ends, such as the eradication of poverty and successful economic development. Unsurprisingly different organizations have defined governance and good governance differently to promote different normative ends.

The [[World Bank]] defines governance as:
{{quote|the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country's economic and social resources for development.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/03/07/000090341_20060307104630/Rendered/PDF/34899.pdf Managing Development – The Governance Dimension], 1991, Washington D.C., p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project of the World Bank defines governance as:
{{quote|the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/1740479-1150402582357/2661829-1158008871017/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This considers the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies and the respect of citizens and the state of the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them.

An alternate definition sees governance as:
{{quote|the use of institutions, structures of authority and even [[collaboration]] to allocate [[Resource (economics)|resources]] and coordinate or control activity in society or the economy''.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Stephen, 2002. Economic Governance and Institutional Dynamics, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s Regional Project on Local Governance for Latin America:

{{quote|Governance has been defined as the rules of the political system to solve conflicts between actors and adopt decision (legality). It has also been used to describe the "proper functioning of institutions and their acceptance by the public" (legitimacy). And it has been used to invoke the efficacy of government and the achievement of consensus by democratic means (participation).&lt;ref&gt;This is a very widely cited definition, as in [http://info.publicintelligence.net/ISAFgovernance.pdf Applebaugh, J. (rapporteur), "Governance Working Group", power-point presentation, National Defense University and ISAF, 2010, slide 22].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Measurement and assessment===

Since the early years of the 2000s (decade),{{When|date=January 2012}} efforts have been conducted in the research and international development community to assess and measure the quality of governance of countries all around the [[world]]. Measuring governance is inherently a controversial and somewhat political exercise. A distinction is therefore made between external assessments, peer assessments and self-assessments. Examples of external assessments are donor assessments or comparative indices produced by international non-governmental organizations. An example of a peer assessment is the [[African Peer Review Mechanism]]. Examples of self-assessments are [http://gaportal.org/country-initiatives country-led assessments] that can be led by government, civil society, researchers and/or other stakeholders at the national level.

One of these efforts to create an internationally comparable measure of governance and an example of an external assessment is the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project, developed by members of the World Bank and the [[World Bank Institute]]. The project reports aggregate and individual indicators for more than 200 countries for six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and lack of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, [[rule of law]], control of corruption. To complement the macro-level cross-country Worldwide Governance Indicators, the World Bank Institute developed the [[World Bank Governance Surveys]], which are country-level governance assessment tools that operate at the micro or sub-national level and use information gathered from a country’s own citizens, business people and public sector workers to diagnose governance vulnerabilities and suggest concrete approaches for fighting corruption.

A Worldwide Governance Index (WGI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144807/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 4 October 2011 | year =  | title = World Governance Index 2009 Report | publisher = World Governance | accessdate = 3 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed in 2009 and is open for improvement through public participation. The following domains, in the form of indicators and composite indexes, were selected to achieve the development of the WGI: Peace and Security, Rule of Law, Human Rights and Participation, Sustainable Development, and Human Development. Additionally, in 2009 the Bertelsmann Foundation published the [[Sustainable Governance Indicators]] (SGI), which systematically measure the need for reform and the capacity for reform within the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries. The project examines to what extent governments can identify, formulate and implement effective reforms that render a society well-equipped to meet future challenges, and ensure their future viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl = http://www.sgi-network.de/index.php?page=mission  | accessdate = | last = Empter  | first1 = Stefan  | first2 = Josef | last2 = Janning  | chapter=Sustainable Governance Indicators 2009 – An Introduction | editor-first  = Bertelsmann | editor-last = Stiftung | year = 2009| title = Policy Performance and Executive Capacity in the OECD | location = Gütersloh | publisher = Verlag Bertelsmann Stiftung}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20160413110418/http://xml.fido.gov/stratml/references/PL111-532StratML.htm#SEC10 Section 10] of the [[Government Performance and Results Act]] (GPRA) Modernization Act requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable format.

The OBS is a comprehensive analysis and survey that evaluates whether central governments give the public access to budget documents and provide opportunities for public participation in the budget process. To measure the overall commitment to transparency, the IBP created [http://survey.internationalbudget.org/#rankings Open Budget Index] (OBI), which assigns a score to each country based on the results of the survey. While the OBS is released biannually, the IBP recently released a new [http://www.obstracker.org/ OBS Tracker], which serves as an online tool for civil society, the media, and other actors to monitor in real time whether governments are releasing eight key budget documents. The Open Budget Index data are used by the [[Open Government Partnership]], development aid agencies, and increasingly investors in the private sector as key indicators of governance, particularly fiscal transparency and management of public funds.&lt;ref&gt;Castro, Michael, 12 September 2013, [http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/michael-castro/2013/09/12/open-budgets-key-open-government-next-steps-ogp-countries#sthash.cFZvst8q.dpuf Open Budgets Key to Open Government: Next Steps for OGP Countries], retrieved 2 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of country-led assessments include the [http://www.gaportal.org/undp-supported/indonesia Indonesian Democracy Index], monitoring of the [http://www.gaportal.org/undp-supported/mongolia Millennium Development Goal 9 on Human Rights and Democratic Governance in Mongolia] and the [http://www.gaportal.org/undp-supported/bhutan Gross National Happiness Index in Bhutan].

Publishing performance reports openly on the Web in a standard, machine-readable format is good practice for all organizations whose plans and reports should be matters of public record.

'''Hermippus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἕρμιππος}}; fl. 5th century BC) was the one-eyed [[Athenian]] writer of the [[Old Comedy]] who flourished during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. 
==Life==
He was the son of Lysis, and the brother of the comic poet Myrtilus. He was younger than [[Telecleides]] and older than [[Eupolis]] and [[Aristophanes]]. According to the [[Suda]], he wrote forty plays &lt;ref&gt;Suda ε 3044&lt;/ref&gt;, and his chief actor was Simeron, according to the [[scholia]]st of Aristophanes. The titles and fragments of nine of his plays are preserved. He was a bitter opponent of [[Pericles]], whom he accused (probably in the ''Moirai'') of being a bully and a coward, and of carousing with his boon companions while the [[Lacedaemon]]ians were invading [[Attica]]. He also accused [[Aspasia]] of impiety and offences against morality, and her acquittal was only secured by the tears of Pericles ([[Plutarch]], ''Pericles'', 32). In the "Female Bread-Sellers", he attacked the [[demagogue]] [[Hyperbolus]]. The "Mat-Carriers" contains many parodies of [[Homer]].

==Surviving titles and fragments==
Ninety-four fragments of Hermippus' work survives, along with the following nine titles:

{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
*''Athenas Gonai'' ("Birth of Athena")
*''Artopolides'' ("Female Bread-Sellers")
*''Demotai'' ("Citizens")
*''Europa'' ("[[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]")
*''Theoi'' ("Gods")
*''Kerkopes'' ("[[Cercopes]]")
*''Moirai'' ("Fates")
*''Stratiotai'' ("Soldiers")
*''Phormophoroi'' ("Mat-Carriers")
{{div col end}}

Hermippus also appears to have written scurrilous [[iambus (genre)|iambic]] poems after the manner of [[Archilochus]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas E. Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 9&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of works written by Hermippus cited by ancient writers include [[trimeter]]s and [[tetrameter]]s.

[[File:Jiří Polívka C.jpg|thumb|Jiří Polívka]]
'''Jiří Polívka''' (March 6, 1858 – March 21, 1933, in [[Prague]]) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[linguist]], [[slavist]], [[literary historian]] and [[folklorist]]. He was a disciple of [[Jan Gebauer]]. In 1895 he was appointed professor at [[Charles University]] in Prague.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3195">The '''Kraft Circle''' was a student society of [[Philosophy|philosophers]] at the Institut für Österreichische Geschichtsforschung of the [[University of Vienna]] devoted to "considering philosophical problems in a nonmetaphysical manner and with special reference to the findings of the sciences".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Feyerabend, “Herbert Feigl: A Biographical Sketch”, in P. K. Feyerabend and Grover Maxwell (eds.), ''Mind, Matter, and Method: Essays in Philosophy and Science in Honor of Herbert Feigl'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1966), 1–2, quoted in Preston 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Its chairman and leading professor was [[Viktor Kraft]], a former associate of the [[Vienna Circle]], to which the Kraft Circle is sometimes viewed as a post-[[Second World War]] extension. The Circle was a part of the Austrian College Society founded in 1945 by [[Austria]]n resistance fighters.&lt;ref&gt;An early leader was Otto Molden, brother of Fritz Molden of publishing house fame (Feyerabend 1988, 274).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The club was founded in 1949 by science and engineering students interested in the philosophical foundations of their disciplines. In the first year [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] gave a talk.&lt;ref&gt;He "took a long time to make up his mind and then appeared over an hour later [and] gave a spirited performance and seemed to prefer our disrespectful attitude to the fawning admiration he encountered elsewhere" (Feyerabend 1988, 274).&lt;/ref&gt; The members were mainly students, but there were occasional faculty attendees and even "foreign dignitaries" made appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend 1988, 274, lists the Hungarian Béla Juhos, the Austrians Erich Heintel and Walter Hollitscher, the Finn [[Georg Henrik von Wright]] and the Englishwoman [[G. E. M. Anscombe]].&lt;/ref&gt; Meetings of the circle took place during the academic year, while international meetings of the Austrian College Society took place during the summer at [[Alpbach]]. The circle disbanded in 1952/53. Feyerabend's paper "An Attempt at a Realistic Interpretation of Experience" (''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'' [1958]) is "a condensed version of the discussions in the Kraft Circle".&lt;ref&gt;Preston 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21189">The '''Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing''' or '''LC4MP''' is an explanatory theory that assumes humans have a limited capacity for [[cognitive processing]] of information, as it associates with mediated message variables; moreover, they (viewers) are actively engaged in processing mediated information&lt;ref&gt;Lang, A. (2000). The information processing of mediated messages: A framework for communication research.'' Journal of Communication'', 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many [[mass communication]] theories, LC4MP is an amalgam that finds its origins in psychology. Specifically, this theory has its origins in the Limited Capacity Model for understanding cognitive information processing. The most fundamental assumptions of information processing are the three dimensions of [[cognitive processing]]. The three dimensions: 1) [[encoding]], 2) storage, and 3) retrieval. This is how viewers get presented information into their heads. Messages can be processed under controlled conditions or they can be automatically elicited.

== Limited capacity theory ==

When a message processor decides to pay attention to a message because it appeals to their interests, and they allocate resources to information processing, the controlled message engagement subprocess begins; conversely, when a message processor is cued automatically, and they are paying attention, the same process of allocating cognitive resources begins to elicit message processing. First, message engagement, which is a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] approach/avoidance interaction engages the appetitive and aversive cognitive subprocesses. In the most lay terms, these are basic fight or flight responses that happen in mere nanoseconds. This information then can report to sensor stores in the brain; and if it is useful, it will move to short term memory and long term memory.&lt;ref&gt;Lang et al, 2000, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognitive resources ==

There are several key concepts in the LC4MP: total resources, resources allocated, resources required, resources remaining, and resources available. Total resources refer to the total resources in the resource pool. Resources allocated refer to the resources that are actually available for a processing task. The resource allocated to a task may be equivalent to the total resources, but probably is not. '''''Resources required''''' are the amount of resources necessary to complete a task ([https://drive.google.com/a/mix.wvu.edu/file/d/0B8r89BbARRQISG5NR2l4a3NFMm8/view?usp=sharing See Total-Allocated-Required Resources].).  '''''Resources remaining''''' refer to the difference between total resources and resources required. '''''Resources available''''' are the difference between the resources allocated and the resources required.&lt;ref&gt;Lang &amp; Basil, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Resources remaining and resources available may be the same if total resources are equivalent to resources allocated, but this is unlikely the case. [https://drive.google.com/a/mix.wvu.edu/file/d/0B8r89BbARRQISG5NR2l4a3NFMm8/view?usp=sharing See the overall picture of mental resources in information processing.]

The reasons for these fine-tuned distinctions are several. First, people may not allocate all of the available resources to a task at hand because they are [[cognitive miser]]s. Unless highly motivated, people tend to use as few resources as necessary. Thus, a distinction is made between total resources and allocated resources. Second, people will allocate resources only as required by the task. If people are watching a program they have seen before, fewer resources may be required because of the familiarity of the program. Conversely, if the production is such that the visual elements of the programming are important, then more resources may be required. In both cases, the same amount of resources may have been allocated to the TV program, but different amounts were actually used, leaving some allocated resources available in one case but not in another. Third, some elements in the environment will automatically draw resources. For example, formal features automatically attract attention (e.g., unrelated cuts), drawing required resources from the total pool of resources without conscious allocation of resources. In this case, the difference between the automatic attraction (i.e., required) of resources and the total resources leaves some remaining resources for allocation to other tasks.

Within this model, media messages may receive insufficient or limited processing for two basic reasons (i.e., cognitive overload). First, there may not be enough resources available to process the message fully (i.e., the required resources exceed the total resources). For example, a message on a topic that a person does not understand may require so many resources – perhaps trying to retrieve information from long-term memory – that, even though all resources may have been allocated to the task, the required resources for retrieval leave neither remaining nor available resources for attending to and encoding the message. Second, there may be enough resources available to process the message but those resources are not allocated to the task for reasons such as insufficient motivation or because the person is multitasking (e.g., resources required exceeds resources allocated). For example, when a person is cooking and watching TV at the same time, there may not be enough resources available to process the TV program entirely.

Watching TV involves a number of simultaneous cognitive processes. TV viewing often requires people to engage in processing auditory and visual information, and integrating these two channels of information.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Potter, &amp; Bolls, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, both the auditory and visual information include the content of the program as well as the formal features of TV which can act as syntax for the programming. The viewer must integrate all of this information to understand the program. In addition, viewers are storing new information in memory and activating existing knowledge to aid in comprehending the program. Research under the rubric of the LC4MP focuses on how resources are allocated to the various processes that are occurring and the effects of differential resource allocation on attention, encoding, and retrieval.

== Encoding, storage, and retrieval ==

Encoding of information is a subprocess where a stimulus orients a person to a message, vel non. In terms of message processing, its effectiveness is determined by the number of cognitive resources allocated to the encoding process.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; If the person is exposed to a stimulus, and they choose to pay attention, the brain will treat that mediated message like it was reality. That is, the brain creates an "[[orienting response]] (OR), which is an automatic cognitive response to novel information".&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This response is a cognitive reaction to a change in the environment,&lt;ref&gt;Lang &amp; Basil, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and can be measured via implicit measures of recognition and explicit measures such as [[electrochemical]] reactions in the body.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, 2006, Lang, et al. 2000, Lang et al 1999&lt;/ref&gt; These cognitive processes can be both automatic, as in the case of OR’s, or controlled. In either event, the next step in the message engagement process is to move the information into storage.

Storage is conceptually modeled as a cognitive sub-processing of information into and through the general associative network.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Associative networks are conceptual “nodes” that map brain uses as sensor stores—for short-term and long term memory.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 1983, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; They are conceptualized as the site where information is stored and ultimately retrieved. Under normal conditions, if there are many associative links available for information processing, “the more readily retrievable that information will become”;&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; hence, then “retrieval” time of information is faster and more accessible. Storage of information is measured via [[cued recall]].

Information retrieval is conceptualized as the third fundamental conceptual sub process of information processing, and it is a function of memory, which is measured via free recall. Measuring free recall is based on an individual’s levels of sensitivity to stimuli, without being cued to the information.

== Cognitive memory ==

Automatic cognitive responses are elicited via a cognitive response to novel information, the primary method in which automatic responses are elicited is through structural cues of the communication situation.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Lang, et al. (2000) elaborates on this by controlling the structural features. They discovered that the relatedness of the media messages mattered. They dissected the pacing of mediated content into two categories: one that used related editing in camera angle and content; and, another with unrelated cuts to unrelated information to the previous information that was being encoded and stored.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, et al. 2000, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; These pacing cues are important to media producers because they can either help reinforce attention into memory; or they can created a low memory retention condition in the minds of the message processor.

By inserting edits, which are operationalized by the process of switching cameras or transitions in visual or audio media, media producers can elicit orienting responses in attentive viewers. This is accomplished because the mechanism of allocating resources to memory message processing is effective in low, medium, and high edit conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, et al. 2000, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, retrieval is also possible and is measured via recognition testing. However, unlike related editing cues, unrelated cuts do not make it into memory, especially when the cuts are coming at the message processor rapidly. This is important, secondarily, because the entire illusion of a commercially driven media system is premised on the concept that advertising sells products. More importantly, this article's primary concern is to instruct media producers—who are concerned with generating public information, the importance of editing cues, and the deleterious uses of disparate advertising and its ineffectiveness.

== Methods ==

Methodologically, the LC4MP uses three primary sets of measures to study how people allocate resources and process information. Secondary task reaction time (STRT) is a measure of the amount of resources allocated to attention. STRT involves people engaging in a primary task such as watching TV while also monitoring a second task such as pressing a button whenever a cue such as a tone sounds or a light comes on.&lt;ref&gt;see more specific explanation of STRTs; Lang &amp; Basil, 1998; Reeves &amp; Thorson, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of resources that are available (i.e., resources allocated minus resources required) has been demonstrated to influence how long it takes people to respond in the STRT.&lt;ref&gt;Lang &amp; Basil, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; When there are a lot of resources available, people quickly notice the light or tone and are quick to press a button. But when resources are low or taxed, people take longer to notice the light or tone and are slower to respond. For example, a cut to an unrelated scene tends to tax resources because of the new information that needs to be processed, and STRT is slower. Critically, STRT is a function of both the resources allocated to the task and the resources required by the task.&lt;ref&gt;Lang et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A second set of methodological tools involves physiological measures such as heart rate, galvanic skin responses (sweating) or muscle activity. Heart rate is used as a measure of whether an orienting response has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000; Lang, Geiger, Strickwerda &amp; Sumner, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; When people show an aroused response, their heart rate decelerates for a few seconds before returning toward their baseline. Likewise, an increase in skin conductance is evidence of an aroused response. Thus, the combined evidence of heart rate deceleration and an increase in skin conductance provides convergent evidence that an orienting response (OR) has occurred.

A final set of methodological tools involves measures of memory including recall and recognition measures.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The measures of memory are used to make inferences about encoding and retrieval processes. For example, if messages are simple, increasing people’s attention to a message through the inclusion of formal features that orient attention, such as edits, results in improvements in memory for the message. This finding suggests that there were available resources (i.e., more resources allocated than required) that could be diverted to encoding processes. Conversely, with a complex message, the addition of features that increase ORs tends to lead to decrements in memory, which suggests that ORs automatically drew resources away from encoding processes and resulted in worse memory. The decreased performance on memory tests is one indication that the resources required has exceeded the resources allocated to the task.

== Limits of LC4MP ==

The ability of information processing of [[mediated messages]] has limits. Interference with the encoding, storage, and retrieval of messages; especially when the receiver is not interested in the message, creates a situation where the required resources needed to process information are not dedicated; and, “fewer associative links will be made available to the message... therefore, it limits their ability to process media” (&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;). This is a concern for researchers interested in studying how people encode and store information because if information processors do not devote the appropriate number of resources required to process information, then [[information overload]] will inhibit the abilities of individuals to encoding, store, and retrieve information.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the ability to information processors to process messages is also limited by their unique retrieval sub processing abilities, which are related to perceptions compiled over time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Thus, the sub process of retrieval is affected by two dimensions termed, “later retrieval-done after the fact and concurrent retrieval- in real time affect information processing of messages”.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

As a conceptual level of LC4MP, constructivism argues the limitation of information processing theoretical view, although the argues are not in the mediated media world but in more foundational psychology world. Before to point out specific limits of the view, it is useful to summarize the characteristics of information processing views for contrast. First, this view has it that information gains (e.g., learning) can be conceived as internal structures (e.g., long term memory) changing to reflect changes in the external world, which represents "reality". Within the traditional information processing view this real world is "knowable" and, as a consequence a student's knowledge can be ultimately judged as right or wrong. A second important characteristic of the information processing view is that there are general principles of learning, knowledge, etc. that hold true across situations and across learners, and it is the job of the researcher and theorist to ascertain these general principles.

On the other hand, a fundamental characteristic of the prototypical constructivist view is that no knowledge is absolute, rather knowledge is constructed. For example, the constructivists point to all the times in history when something was thought be a "fact", but was later discounted. This view is in contrast with the "absolute reality" basis of the information processing view. Another fundamental characteristics of the structuralist perspective is that learning only occurs within some context. So, for example, to consider learning independent of the environment in which it occurs (e.g., school, work, or play), is unrealistic and incomplete. This, again, is inconsistent with both the behaviorist and information processing views (and much of science in general, for that matter) in that these latter theories are based on the assumption that fundamental principles can be ascertained that will apply broadly across contexts and across learners.

These distinctions may sound quite abstract and removed from "real life" classroom instruction to you. In fact, in a practical/applied sense there are some important implications and practices that have emerged from this constructivist view since it has come into favor in the last decade. The general view that knowledge is not so absolute, that it is "constructed" puts more of an emphasis on the knowledge and conceptions that students brings to the classroom. This leads to a more "learner centered approach", with the teacher as more of a "guide on the side", as opposed to a "sage on the stage". Further, in a "constructivist classroom" students are more free to participate in the planning (i.e., "negotiate") and, even, the assessment process. Another implication of the "relative" nature of knowledge contention is that it is important to present the learner with multiple perspectives on a single topic or concept.

'''La Blanca''' is a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site in the [[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipality]] of [[Melchor de Mencos]] in the northern [[Petén Department]] of [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="Muñoz340"&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, p.340.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is located in the lower reaches of the [[Mopan River]] valley and features a large acropolis complex.&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, pp.340-341.&lt;/ref&gt; Activity at the site has been dated as far back as the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]] (AD 250–600), with principal occupation of the site occurring in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] period (AD 600–900),&lt;ref name="MC343"&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, p.343.&lt;/ref&gt; although some level of occupation continued into the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Postclassic]] (AD 900–1200).&lt;ref name="VL563"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo et al 2007, p.563.&lt;/ref&gt;

La Blanca occupied a frontier zone between the northeastern and southeastern Petén regions and the site is dominated by the acropolis, an especially well built palace complex.&lt;ref name="Vidal790"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo 2006, p.790.&lt;/ref&gt; The city appears to have been an administrative centre with comparatively little emphasis upon religious or ceremonial activity.&lt;ref name="VL575"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo et al 2007, p.575.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that La Blanca was a subsidiary of a major Maya city such as [[Yaxha]] or [[Naranjo]], given the complete absence of [[Maya script|hieroglyphic texts]] and sculpted monuments,&lt;ref name="VL575"/&gt; and archaeologists presume that La Blanca served as a frontier post or [[Trade in Maya civilization|trading centre]].&lt;ref name="VL575"/&gt;

During the Late Classic there was greater public access to the acropolis; as the threat of [[Maya warfare|warfare]] grew during the Terminal Classic (AD 800-900), access became much more restricted. The end of formal occupation of the city in the Terminal Classic appears to have been violent, with evidence of a [[Maya warfare|battle]] recovered during excavations of the acropolis.&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz49"/&gt; Refugees appear to have occupied the city centre immediately after the collapse of formal settlement at La Blanca, but they abandoned the city for good in the 11th century, after which it was never reoccupied.

The acropolis buildings contain inscribed [[Ancient Maya graffiti|graffiti]] dating to the last phase of occupation in the Early Postclassic, including human and animal figures, deities, temples and courtly scenes. Colonial graffiti is also evident from the visit to the ruins by captain Pedro Montañés in the middle of the 18th century.

==Location==
[[File:Petén savannah 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Savannah ranchland surrounds the archaeological site]]
La Blanca is accessed by a dirt road leading {{convert|17|km|mi}} to the highway linking [[Flores, El Petén|Flores]] with Melchor de Mencos; the dirt road joins the highway at La Pólvora.&lt;ref name="Vidal790"/&gt; In the other direction this road leads approximately {{convert|3|km|mi}} to a village, also called La Blanca;&lt;ref name="Vidal790"/&gt; this modern village extends along the shores of a small lake.&lt;ref name="Vidal790"/&gt; The archaeological site is located to the south of a range of hills reaching a maximum height of {{convert|490|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz45"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo &amp; Muñoz Cosme undated 2, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site occupies a small pocket of forest amongst an extensive region of cleared agricultural land.&lt;ref name="Vidal791"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo 2006, p.791.&lt;/ref&gt; The agricultural land closest to the ruins is largely dedicated to livestock grazing, particularly cattle and horses.&lt;ref name="Vidal791"/&gt; La Blanca is located close to the Mopan River and its tributary, the [[Salsipuedes River]].&lt;ref name="Vidal791"/&gt; Some of the land between the ruins and the rivers is subject to frequent flooding, a factor that must have had some impact upon the inhabitants of the city.&lt;ref name="Vidal791"/&gt;

The forest covering the archaeological site reaches an average height of {{convert|22|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz45"/&gt; It contains around 60 tree species,&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz45"/&gt; among which the most notable are breadnut trees (''[[Brosimum alicastrum]]'') and [[Attalea (plant)|corozo palms]] (''[[Orbignya cohune]]'').&lt;ref name="Vidal791"/&gt;

==History==
The earliest occupation at La Blanca was concentrated in the South Group and dates to the Early Classic Period.&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz48"/&gt; However, major occupation of the site appears to have begun in the Late Classic Period.&lt;ref name="Vidal571"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo et al 2007, p.571.&lt;/ref&gt; Public spaces were covered with white stucco and the first [[Maya architecture|architecture]] was erected at the site.&lt;ref name="Vidal800"/&gt; The basal platform of the acropolis appears to have been built before the Great North Plaza was laid out.&lt;ref name="Vidal800"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo 2006, p.800.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Late Classic there appears to have been greater public access to the acropolis, with stairways communicating between the various terraces leading up to the south range.&lt;ref name="VL574"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo et al 2007, p.574.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Terminal Classic, these stairways were filled in, as were many of the access doorways to the acropolis itself, with some buildings being sealed completely.&lt;ref name="VL574"/&gt; This closing of public access to the palace reflects the greater political instability engulfing the entire Petén region at this time.&lt;ref name="VL574"/&gt; The acropolis complex was abandoned by the city's elite in the Terminal Classic, a time when most of the city centre was also deserted by its residents.&lt;ref name="Vidal571"/&gt; Many flint projectile points were recovered from the south terraces of the acropolis, this combined with the remains of two individuals very near the surface indicates that a violent confrontation took place around the time that the city was abandoned.&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz49"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo &amp; Muñoz Cosme undated 2, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, at the dawn of the Postclassic, immediately after the [[Classic Maya collapse]], the acropolis was reoccupied by refugees from the periphery of the city.&lt;ref name="Vidal571"/&gt; These final occupants appear to have abandoned the city some time in the 11th century AD, after which it was never reoccupied.&lt;ref name="VL575"/&gt;

===Modern history===
[[File:La Blanca graffiti 3.jpg|thumb|left|18th century graffiti in the acropolis]]
In the 18th century Pedro Montañés passed through the site and left graffiti with his name and the year 1752.&lt;ref name="Muñoz341"&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, p.341.&lt;/ref&gt; Archives have revealed that he was a Spanish captain who visited the site on 14 August of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Quintana Samayoa 1998, p.107.&lt;/ref&gt; La Blanca was first documented in the early years of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Muñoz340"/&gt; In 1905 explorer [[Teoberto Maler]] identified visible architecture at the site and marked it as El Castillito on a map of the region.&lt;ref name="Muñoz340"/&gt; Raymond E. Merwin visited La Blanca in 1913 on behalf of the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] of [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="Muñoz340"/&gt; He photographed the site and renamed it as Chac-Ha.&lt;ref name="Muñoz340"/&gt; At this time the site appears to have been covered in dense vegetation, making exploration of the ruins difficult and resulting in only a brief description of the acropolis.&lt;ref name="Muñoz341"/&gt;

[[Ian Graham]] published a plan of the site in 1980, based on explorations in preceding years.&lt;ref name="Muñoz341"/&gt; Further explorations have taken place on behalf of the Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala and the Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo Project.&lt;ref name="Muñoz341"/&gt; The Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo Project started work at the site in 1994 with preliminary work consisted of mapping and photographing the ruins.&lt;ref name="Vidal791"/&gt; In 1995 the ruins were cleared of undergrowth and in 1996 the Unidad de Arquelogía Regional de Guatemala (Guatemalan Regional Archaeology Unit) surveyed the ruins, recorded damage by looters and sank test pits, all under the direction of Vilma Fialko.&lt;ref name="Vidal791"/&gt; From 1997 to 1998 looting damage was repaired and architecture deemed at risk of collapse was [[underpinning|underpinned]].&lt;ref name="Vidal791"/&gt; In 1999 further underpinning work was undertaken as a result of earthquake damage and detailed plans were made of the architecture in 2000.&lt;ref name="Vidal791"/&gt; The Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala included La Blanca in its survey of three sites in the lower Mopan valley in 2001.&lt;ref name="Vidal791"/&gt; More recently, investigations have been funded by the [[Ministry of Culture (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Culture]] together with the [[University of Valencia]] and the [[Polytechnic University of Valencia]].&lt;ref name="Muñoz341"/&gt; Excavations continued in 2004 both in the city centre and in the South Group, where looting damage was recorded and repaired.&lt;ref name="Vidal791"/&gt;

==Site description==
{{Maya civilization}}
The site covers an area of about {{convert|26|ha|acre}} and a great many structures have been identified by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, p.342. Vidal Lorenzo &amp; Muñoz Cosme undated 2, p.45."&lt;/ref&gt; The principal [[Maya architecture|architecture]] has been dated to the Late Classic period.&lt;ref name="MC343"/&gt; The layout of the city is somewhat unusual in that the north-south axis is oriented 12° west of north whereas most Maya cities have the major axis a similar amount east of north.&lt;ref name="MC343"/&gt; The political and administrative functions were concentrated in the eastern portion of the city, which is taken to include the South Group, as evidenced by the superior architectural quality in these areas.&lt;ref name="Vidal800"/&gt;

The Great North Plaza is a large square-plan plaza measuring {{convert|70|by|70|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="MC343"/&gt; The Plaza was levelled by packing it with a clay-based mud, work that took place in the Late Classic Period based on the evidence of ceramic and flint artefacts recovered during investigations.&lt;ref name="VL06 792"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo 2006, p.792.&lt;/ref&gt; This clay mud conataining [[Palygorskite|attapulgite]] was likely to have been brought to the city from the nearby swamps.&lt;ref name="VL06 792"/&gt; Excavations in the plaza and close to the acropolis revealed the presence of a [[retaining wall]] probably related to the construction of the great platform supporting the acropolis itself.&lt;ref name="VL06 792"/&gt;

A {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} wide [[sacbe|causeway]] runs south from the Plaza, running to the west of the acropolis and parallel to it.&lt;ref name="MC343"/&gt; This causeway runs south for approximately {{convert|300|m|ft}} to the South Group.&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz45"/&gt; The area west of the causeway contains a large number of smaller mounds and platforms and is believed to be an extensive residential area.&lt;ref name="MC343"/&gt; This residential area includes three large plazas, the northern of which is divided from the Great North Plaza by a row of structures.&lt;ref name="MC344"&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, p.344.&lt;/ref&gt; A stairway may have led southwards from this down to the Central West Plaza, which is on the opposite side of the causeway from the Acropolis.&lt;ref name="MC344"/&gt; The south side of the Central West Plaza is bordered by a {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} long structure that divides it from the South West Plaza.&lt;ref name="MC344"/&gt; An area of smaller mounds extends further west and are believed to represent lesser residential districts of the city.&lt;ref name="MC344"/&gt;

The area to the east of the city drops away rapidly and lacks extensive settlement remains, perhaps due to periodic flooding by the Mopan and Salsipuedes rivers discouraging the occupation of the eastern zone.&lt;ref name="MC344"/&gt;

===Acropolis===
[[File:La Blanca, Petén 6.jpg|thumb|left|Outer west side of the acropolis]]
The most important architectural complex is the [[acropolis]], a palace with an enclosed courtyard located within the Great North Plaza.&lt;ref name="MC343"/&gt; The acropolis is also known as the Quadrangle due to its layout.&lt;ref name="Vidal791"/&gt; A series of terraces lead down from the acropolis to a {{convert|1500|m2|sqft|adj=on}} reservoir to the south, which appears to have been a private water source for the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, p.343. Vidal Lorenzo 2006, p.797.&lt;/ref&gt; The reservoir itself is now dried out.&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz45"/&gt; The acropolis was accessed via a wide stairway from the Great North Plaza.&lt;ref name="MC343"/&gt; The form of the plaza and the acropolis are unusual, although similar complexes have been identified at [[Tayasal]], [[Ixlú]] and [[Kinal]].&lt;ref name="MC343"/&gt;

Excavations in the acropolis revealed the presence of at least two superimposed platforms built with finely dressed stone blocks and covered with good quality stucco flooring.&lt;ref name="VL06 795"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo 2006, p.795.&lt;/ref&gt; At a later date the platforms and courtyard were covered with unworked stones bound with mortar and covered with another stucco floor.&lt;ref name="VL06 795"/&gt; The two platforms were built in the Late Classic and appear to have been covered over in the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="VL06 795"/&gt;

The interior courtyard measures approximately {{convert|36|m|ft}} on each side and was completely enclosed by the palace, creating a very private space within.&lt;ref name="Muñoz345"&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, p.345.&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings on the north, west and south sides faced outwards away from the private courtyard, opening onto it only via a central doorway in each structure.&lt;ref name="Muñoz345"/&gt; The eastern structure was built at a later date, has two lateral doorways and was the only side to face directly onto the courtyard; it highly may have been the residence of the city's ruler.&lt;ref name="Muñoz345"/&gt; Entrance to the courtyard is from the exterior the acropolis via these central doorways on the north, south and west sides.&lt;ref name="MC349"&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, p.349.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these three entrances, the northern entrance appears to have been the main entrance to the acropolis complex.&lt;ref name="MC349"/&gt; The south entrance was a more private entrance that opened from the acropolis onto the terraces leading down to the water source in that direction.&lt;ref name="MC349"/&gt; The western entrance lead to the terrace {{convert|5|m|ft}} above the causeway, providing a balcony with an excellent view across the city.&lt;ref name="MC349"/&gt;

The cut stone walls of the acropolis are of very high quality, constructed of large, finely cut blocks at times forming walls almost {{convert|2|m|ft}} thick, filled with rubble and mortar.&lt;ref name="Muñoz345"/&gt; The exterior faces of the walls are carefully dressed and the interior of good quality vaulted ceilings.&lt;ref name="Muñoz345"/&gt; Although such high quality work can be found in parts of major cities such as [[Tikal]], its presence in a smaller site such as La Blanca is considered surprising by archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Muñoz345"/&gt; The walls facing the interior courtyard have been especially well preserved.&lt;ref name="Muñoz345"/&gt; During survey work at the arcopolis, archaeologists discovered a {{convert|13.5|cm|in|adj=on}} long flint knife deliberately embedded in the interior of the north wall, it weighed {{convert|225|g|oz}}.&lt;ref name="MC346"&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, p.346.&lt;/ref&gt; The knife was embedded in the mortar of the infill with the blade pointing outwards, with three embedded decorations near the tip.&lt;ref name="MC346"/&gt; Archaeologists believe the blade was deposited during rituals associated with the construction of the building.&lt;ref name="MC346"/&gt;

[[File:La Blanca, Petén 15.jpg|thumb|right|The west (inner) side of the east range of the acropolis, believed to be the royal apartments]]
The outer eastern wall of the acropolis is especially well preserved, including a cornice {{convert|3.8|m|ft}} above the floor level of the building, which is {{convert|4|to|5|m|ft}} above the plaza floor.&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, pp.346-347.&lt;/ref&gt; The wall continued above the cornice for another {{convert|3|m|ft}} and this section probably supported a [[stucco]] frieze.&lt;ref name="MC347"&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, p.347.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire eastern face of the building measured {{convert|32|m|ft}} long and stood {{convert|12|to|13|m|ft}} above the level of the Great North Plaza.&lt;ref name="MC347"/&gt; This wall was completely blank, without any doorways or other openings.&lt;ref name="MC346"/&gt;

The range structures on the other sides of the courtyards, all opening outwards away from it, consisted of a series of rooms of varying size.&lt;ref name="MC346"/&gt; The height of the rooms from the palace floor to the top of the vaulting was generally about {{convert|6|m|ft}} throughout the palace.&lt;ref name="MC348"&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, p.348.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior walls were originally painted red and black as demonstrated by surviving traces of pigment.&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz47"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo &amp; Muñoz Cosme undated 2, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior facades of the range structures were originally decorated with sculpted stone friezes representing supernatural beings, fragments of which have been found amongst the collapsed rubble.&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz47"/&gt;

The vaulted ceilings of the palace were skillflly constructed, with sides of equal length unlike in other sites in the [[Petén Basin|Petén region]] where the sides of vaulted ceilings were often of different lengths.&lt;ref name="MC346"/&gt; The vaulting is of exceptional height, reaching up to {{convert|4|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="MC346"/&gt;

====South range====
[[File:La Blanca, Petén 5.jpg|thumb|left|The south side of the south range of the acropolis, with adjoining structure at left]]
The south range measures {{convert|42|m|ft}} long and divides the courtyard from the series of terraces to the south.&lt;ref name="MuñozVidal659"&gt;Muñoz Cosme &amp; Vidal Lorenzo 2007, p.659.&lt;/ref&gt; The rooms of the south range include wide benches running their entire width, they measure {{convert|0.75|m|ft}} high and still preserve their original stucco covering.&lt;ref name="VL564"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo et al 2007, p.564.&lt;/ref&gt; The bench in Room 1 has a small step leading up to it.&lt;ref name="VL564"/&gt; The walls of the rooms are relatively poorly preserved, although some parts still retain their stucco covering and traces of pigment, as well as inscribed graffiti.&lt;ref name="VL564"/&gt; The lintels over the doors were crafted from [[Manilkara zapota|sapodilla]] wood.&lt;ref name="MuñozLorenzo663"&gt;Muñoz Cosme &amp; Vidal Lorenzo 2007, p.663.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the south-facing rooms have twin, symmetrically placed doorways, a style of architecture that is very unusual for a range structure in the Petén region.&lt;ref name="MuñozLorenzo663"/&gt; Examples are known from minor structures at Tikal but the closest corresponding architecture comes from the [[Puuc]] region of the northern [[Yucatán Peninsula]], at cities such as [[Cacabxnuc]], [[Chelemi]], [[Xcorralche]] and [[Xkalachetzimin]], although they differ in other particulars, such as the vaulting.&lt;ref name="MuñozLorenzo663"/&gt;

Excavations immediately south of the south range uncovered part of a substructure consisting of a well-preserved stucco-covered ''[[talud-tablero|talud]]'' wall and a stairway, these are thought to be the remains of a terrace platform.&lt;ref name="VL564"/&gt; A portion of a second terrace ''talud'' wall was also uncovered.&lt;ref name="VL564"/&gt;
{{clear}}

===West Group===
Investigations of the West Group have revealed an occupation beginning in the Late Classic and reaching its maximum extent in the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Vidal571"/&gt; The construction methods used in the West Group were inferior to those of the acropolis, consisting of finely cut limestone blocks bound with an earth-based mortar rather than the lime-based mortar used in the palace complex.&lt;ref&gt;Vidal Lorenzo 2006, p.796.&lt;/ref&gt; The platforms of the West Group appear to have supported perishable superstructures and some of these buildings may have been dedicated to craft production.&lt;ref name="VL06 797"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo 2006, p.797.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three main plazas of the West Group appear to have lacked stucco flooring and were instead covered with stone chippings.&lt;ref name="VL06 797"/&gt;

===South Group===
[[File:La Blanca, Petén 3.jpg|thumb|left|Pyramid in the South Group]]
The South Group is the furthest group from the centre to possess monumental architecture.&lt;ref name="Vidal799"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo 2006, p.799.&lt;/ref&gt; The South Group is the oldest architectural group at La Blanca, with occupation dating as far back as the Early Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Vidal Lorenzo &amp; Muñoz Cosme undated 2, pp.47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a slightly different orientation to the rest of the site, apparently due to its earlier construction.&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz48"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo &amp; Muñoz Cosme undated 2, p.48.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of number of medium-sized mounds that have been badly damaged by looters.&lt;ref name="Vidal799"/&gt; The larger of the mounds are [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] and there were also a number of other buildings.&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz45"/&gt; One of the mounds measures approximately {{convert|9|m|ft}} high and was almost cut in half by a looters' trench.&lt;ref name="Vidal799"/&gt; Rescue operations uncovered ceramic remains dating to the Late Classic, including a piece bearing a fragment of hieroglyphic text.&lt;ref name="Vidal799"/&gt;

Excavations in 2008 revealed that one of these mounds was a temple pyramid with a well-preserved central stairway.&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz6"&gt;Vidal Lorenzo &amp; Muñoz Cosme undated 1, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graffiti==
{{double image|right|La Blanca graffiti 4.jpg|160|La Blanca graffiti 6.jpg|240|Graffito of a flute player |Graffito of a deer&lt;ref&gt;Vidal Lorenzo 2006, p.798.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The acropolis is also distinguished by a great quantity of graffiti inscribed onto the stucco interior walls of its rooms, some of which display a considerable level of artistic skill.&lt;ref name="Muñoz345"/&gt; The graffiti is believed to date to the last phase of occupation of the acropolis, during the Early Postclassic, and includes local fauna and human figures, some of which are playing musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz Cosme 2006, p.348. Vidal Lorenzo 2006, p.800.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals depicted in the graffiti include a deer, a turtle and a frog.&lt;ref name="VL06 797"/&gt; Two human figures are depicted playing flutes,&lt;ref name="VL06 797"/&gt; while other subjects include pyramid temples, courtly scenes, vulvas and supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="VidalMuñoz47"/&gt;

Analysis of pigment traces from the south range of the acropolis were carried out by the Polytechnic University of Valencia, they revealed a preference for mineral and vegetable pigments of local origin, perhaps collected from the nearby El Camalote hill.&lt;ref name="VL564"/&gt;

==Artefacts==
Many of the artefacts excavated from the acropolis date from the transition from the Terminal Classic Period to the Early Postclassic, when the surrounding population appears to have occupied the abandoned palace.&lt;ref name="Vidal571"/&gt; Excavations of the south range of the acropolis uncovered a great many potsherds (roughly 11,000) dating to the Terminal Classic, and about 150 pieces dating to the Early Postclassic.&lt;ref name="VL563"/&gt; In the same building 150 stone artefacts were excavated together with hundreds of fragments of waste chippings.&lt;ref name="VL563"/&gt; Fifteen incomplete ceramic figurines were also found, including zoomorphic figures and elite human figures with elaborate headdresses.&lt;ref name="VL563"/&gt; One of these figurines was a whistle in the shape of an owl, identical to another found in an excavated rubbish heap in the acropolis courtyard.&lt;ref name="VL563"/&gt; Both of these owl-shaped whistles are very similar to a larger whistle found at [[Yaxha]].&lt;ref name="VL563"/&gt; A number of artefacts were recovered from the threshold of Room 3 of the south range, including a complete terminal classic ceramic vessel, a flint knife, some broken figurine fragments and some lithic fragments.&lt;ref name="VL563"/&gt; In the area of the threshold of Room 4 in the south range a complete Early Postclassic tripod plate was recovered.&lt;ref name="VL563"/&gt; Within Room 4 itself were found a further 70 broken pieces of Terminal Classic ceramics and 232 pieces dated to the Early Postclassic, and a greenstone axe among other finds.&lt;ref&gt;Vidal Lorenzo et al 2007, pp.570-571.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Postclassic fragments were from a tripod pitcher with zoomorph supports that archaeologists were largely able to reconstruct.&lt;ref&gt;Vidal Lorenzo et al 2007, p.570.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 798 Terminal Classic ceramic fragments were found during the exploration of the terraces immediately south of the acropolis, together with stone chippings and pieces of animal bones.&lt;ref name="VL564"/&gt;

Pits sunk within the courtyard of the acropolis revealed 5425 ceramic fragments, 22 fragments of zoomorphic figurines, together with stone and shell artefacts, animal bones and waste flint chips, all dated to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="VL06 792"/&gt;

Analysis of artefacts from La Blanca has revealed an unusual and almost total absence of [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]], while flint of various colours (including red, pink, orange, brown, cream and grey) is particularly common.&lt;ref name="VL06 792"/&gt;

==Burials==
A human burial was found in Room 3 of the south range of the Acropolis.&lt;ref name="Vidal571"/&gt; The remains were found lying on their right side facing towards the west, with arms bent.&lt;ref name="Vidal571"/&gt; Preliminary investigation suggests that the remains are those of a young adult male with a height of approximately {{convert|1.6|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Vidal571"/&gt; The left hand side of the skull is deformed, perhaps as a result of either [[oxycephaly]] or [[plagiocephaly]].&lt;ref name="Vidal571"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2911">The '''List of Unicode radicals''' comprises those [[Unicode]] characters that represent [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical components]] of [[CJK characters]], [[Tangut (Unicode block)|Tangut characters]] or [[Yi Syllables (Unicode block)|Yi syllables]]. These are used primarily for indexing characters in dictionaries.

There are two CJK radicals blocks: the "Kangxi Radicals" block that includes the [[List of Kangxi radicals|214 standard radicals]] used in the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]''; and the "CJK Radicals Supplement" block that includes 115 radical components used in other modern dictionaries, including [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]] and [[Shinjitai|Japanese]] radicals forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Unicode Standard Version 6.2 | url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/ch12.pdf | page=435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one "Tangut Components" block that includes 755 radicals and components that are used to index Tangut characters in dictionaries of the [[Tangut script]] or to describe the structure of Tangut characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Unicode Standard Version 9.0 | url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/ch18.pdf | page=712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one "Yi Radicals" block that includes 55 radicals used to index Yi characters in dictionaries of the [[Yi script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Unicode Standard Version 6.2 | url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/ch12.pdf | pages=421–422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sets of radicals for other [[Chinese family of scripts|sinoform scripts]], such as [[Jurchen script|Jurchen]] and [[Khitan small script]], have also been proposed for encoding in Unicode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Revised Proposal to Encode the Jurchen Characters in UCS | url=http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3788.pdf | date=2012-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Final proposal to encode the Khitan Small Script in the SMP of the UCS | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16245r-n4738r2-khitan-small.pdf | date=2016-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage site]]s are places of importance to [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage]] as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre – The World Heritage Convention|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]] accepted the convention on 24 July 1996, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list.&lt;ref name=belgium&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/be|title=Belgium|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are 13 sites in Belgium inscribed on the list and 16 sites on the tentative list. The first sites in Belgium to be added to the list were the [[Beguinage|Flemish ''Béguinages'']], the [[Grand Place]] in [[Brussels]] and the [[Boat Lifts on the Canal du Centre|lifts on the Canal du Centre]], all three of them inscribed at the 22nd UNESCO session in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom98.htm|title=Report of the Rapporteur|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|date=January 29, 1999|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further sites were added in 1999, 2000, 2005, 2009, 2012, 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref name=belgium/&gt; In total, there are 12 cultural sites, as determined by the organization's [[World Heritage Site#Selection criteria|selection criteria]]. The [[Sonian Forest]], as a part of the extension to the site of [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe]], is the only natural site. Three of the sites are transnational entries.&lt;ref name=belgium/&gt;

| During the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century, mining and the heavy industry that relied on coal formed a major part of Belgium's economy. Most of this mining and industry took place in the ''[[sillon industriel]]'' ("industrial valley" in French), a strip of land running across the country where many of the largest cities in Wallonia are located. The named locations of this World Heritage Site are all situated in or near the area of the ''sillon industriel''. Mining activities in the area declined during the 20th century, and today the four mines listed are no longer operational.

| The [[Maison Guiette]] is the Belgian component of the multinational inscription 'The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement'. The building was listed among 16 other buildings of Le Corbusier in [[Argentina]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Japan]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;br&gt;Maison Guiette was designed by Swiss-French architect [[Le Corbusier]] in 1926 and it was finished in 1927. It served as the home and workplace of Belgian painter René Guiette. It is the only remaining building designed by Le Corbusier in Belgium. It is also known as Les Peupliers, named after the street where the building is situated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1321|title=The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a reverse-chronological '''list of [[oil spill]]s''' that have occurred throughout the world and spill(s) that are currently ongoing. Quantities are measured in [[tonne]]s of [[crude oil]] with one tonne roughly equal to 308 [[US gallon]]s, 256 [[Imperial gallon]]s, 7.33 [[Barrel (unit)|barrels]], or 1165 [[Litre|litres]]. This calculation uses a median value of 0.858 for the specific gravity of [[light crude oil]]; actual values can range from 0.816 to 0.893, so the amounts shown below are inexact.  They are also estimates, because the actual volume of an oil spill is difficult to measure exactly.

Note:  The "flow rate" column applies to leaking wells, pipelines, etc., and is often used to estimate the total amount of oil spilled.  The "full cargo" column applies to vessels, vehicles, etc., and represents the maximum amount of oil that could be spilled.  The "spilled" columns indicate the total amount of oil that has been released to the environment so far, and should be based on official estimates found in referenced sources whenever possible.  When official estimates vary, use the "min tonnes" and "max tonnes" columns to show the range of estimates (minimum and maximum) in [[metric tonnes]] (i.e. 1 tonne = 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21456">[[Image:Levallois Preferencial-Animation.gif|thumb|300px|The [[Levallois technique]] of flint-[[knapping]]]]
In [[archaeology]], in particular of the [[Stone Age]], '''lithic reduction''' is the process of fashioning stones or rocks from their natural state into tools or weapons by removing some parts.  It has been intensely studied and many [[archaeological industries]] are identified almost entirely by the [[lithic analysis]] of the precise style of their tools and the [[chaîne opératoire]] of the reduction techniques they used.  

Normally the starting point is the selection of a piece of [[tool stone]] that has been detached by natural geological processes, and is an appropriate size and shape.  In some cases solid rock or larger boulders may be quarried and broken into suitable smaller pieces, and in others the starting point may be a piece of the [[debitage]], a flake removed from a previous operation to make a larger tool.  The selected piece is called the [[lithic core]] (also known as the "objective piece").  A basic distinction is that between flaked or chipped stone, the main subject here, and [[ground stone]] objects made by grinding.  Flaked stone reduction involves the use of a hard hammer percussor, such as a [[hammerstone]], a soft hammer fabricator (made of [[wood]], [[bone]] or [[antler]]), or a wood or antler [[Punch (engineering)|punch]] to detach [[lithic flake]]s from the lithic core.  As flakes are detached in sequence, the original mass of stone is reduced; hence the term for this process.  Lithic reduction may be performed in order to obtain sharp flakes, of which a variety of tools can be made, or to rough out a blank for later refinement into a [[projectile point]], knife, or other object.  Flakes of regular size that are at least twice as long as they are broad are called [[blade (archaeology)|blade]]s.  Lithic tools produced this way may be [[biface|bifacial]] (exhibiting flaking on both sides) or [[uniface|unifacial]] (exhibiting flaking on one side only).
[[File:Mount William Aboriginal stone axe quarry.jpg|thumb|[[Mount William stone axe quarry]] in Australia]]

[[Cryptocrystalline]] or amorphous stone such as [[chert]], [[flint]], [[obsidian]], and [[chalcedony]], as well as other fine-grained stone material, such as [[rhyolite]], [[felsite]], and [[quartzite]], were used as a source material for producing stone tools.  As these materials lack natural [[Cleavage (crystal)|planes of separation]], [[conchoidal fracture]]s occur when they are struck with sufficient force; for these stones this process is called [[knapping]].  The propagation of force through the material takes the form of a [[Hertzian cone]] that originates from the point of impact and results in the separation of material from the objective piece, usually in the form of a partial cone, commonly known as a [[lithic flake]].  This process is predictable, and allows the flintknapper to control and direct the application of force so as to shape the material being worked. Controlled experiments may be performed using glass cores and consistent applied force in order to determine how varying factors affect core reduction.&lt;ref&gt;Macgregor 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that stages in the lithic reduction sequence may be misleading and that a better way to assess the data is by looking at it as a continuum. The assumptions that archaeologists sometimes make regarding the reduction sequence based on the placement of a flake into a stage can be unfounded. For example, a significant amount of cortex can be present on a flake taken off near the very end of the reduction sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shott|first1=M.J.|title=Stage versus continuum models in the debris assemblage from production of a fluted biface|journal=Lithic Technology|date=1996|volume=21|issue=1|pages=6–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Removed flakes exhibit features characteristic of conchoidal fracturing, including [[striking platform]]s, bulbs of force, and occasionally [[eraillure]]s (small secondary flakes detached from the flake's [[bulb of force]]).  Flakes are often quite sharp, with distal edges only a few molecules thick when they have a feather termination. These flakes can be used directly as tools or modified into other utilitarian implements, such as [[spokeshave]]s and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]s.

==Reduction index==
By understanding the complex processes of lithic reduction, archaeologists recognize that the pattern and amount of reduction contribute tremendous effect to lithic assemblage compositions. One of the measurements is the geometric index of reduction. There are two elements in this index: 't' and 'T'. The 'T' is the 'height' of maximum blank thickness and the 't' is the height of retouched scar from the ventral surface. The ratio between t and T is the geometric index of reduction. In theory this ratio shall range between 0 and 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhn|first1=Steve|title=A Geometric Index of Reduction for Unifacial Stone Tools|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1990|volume=17|pages=583–593|DOI=10.1016/0305-4403(90)90038-7|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305440390900387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bigger the number is the larger amount of lost weight from lithic flake. By using a logarithmic scale, a linear relationship between the geometric index and the percentage of original flake weight lost through retouch is confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hiscock|first1=Peter|last2=Clarkson|first2=Chris|title=Experimental evaluation of Kuhn’s geometric index of reduction and the flat-flake problem|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2005|volume=32|pages=1015–1022|DOI=10.1016/j.jas.2005.02.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440305000397}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In choosing a reduction index, it is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each method, and how they fit to the intended research question, as different indices provide different levels of information.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hiscock|first1=Peter|last2=Tabrett|first2=Amy|title=Generalization, inference and the quantification of lithic reduction|journal=World Archaeology|date=2010|volume=42|issue=4|pages=545–561|doi=10.1080/00438243.2010.517669}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Kuhn's geometric index of unifacial reduction (GIUR), which describes the ratio of scar height relative to the flake thickness, is highly influenced by the morphology of the flake blank which limits the applicability of this reduction index.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Techniques==
Alongside the various percussion and manipulation techniques described below, there is evidence that heat was at least sometimes used.  [[Experimental archaeology]] has demonstrated that heated stones are sometimes much easier to flake, with larger flakes being produced in flint, for example.  In some cases the heating changes the colour of the stone.&lt;ref&gt;Kooyman, 65-67&lt;/ref&gt;
  
===Percussion reduction===
Percussion reduction, or percussion flaking, refers to removal of flakes by impact.  Generally, a [[lithic core|core]] or other objective piece, such as a partially formed tool, is held in one hand, and struck with a hammer or percussor.  Alternatively, the objective piece can also be struck between a stationary [[anvil]]-stone, known as bipolar percussion.  Percussion can also be done by throwing the objective piece at an anvil stone.  This is sometimes called projectile percussion. Percussors are traditionally either a stone cobble or pebble, often referred to as a [[hammerstone]], or a billet made of bone, antler, or wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Driscoll|first1=Killian|last2=García-Rojas|first2=Maite|title=Their lips are sealed: identifying hard stone, soft stone, and antler hammer direct percussion in Palaeolithic prismatic blade production|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2014|volume=47|pages=134–141|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2014.04.008|url=http://lithicsireland.ie/driscoll_garcia_rojas_2014_identifying_palaeolithic_blade_production_journal_archaeological_science_47.pdf|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, flakes are struck from a core using a punch, in which case the percussor never actually makes contact with the objective piece. This technique is referred to as indirect percussion.&lt;ref&gt;Andrefsky 2005:12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Hard Hammer.jpg|thumb|right|An example of hard hammer percussion.]]

====Projectile percussion====
Projectile percussion is so basic as to not be considered a technique.  It involves throwing the toolstone at a stationary anvil stone.  This method provides virtually no control over how the toolstone will fragment, and therefore produces a great deal of shatter, and few flakes.  It is difficult to be sure whether or not this method of lithic reduction was ever a commonplace practice, although noting sharp edges on a broken rock might have led early humans to first recognize the value of lithic reduction.

====Bipolar percussion====
In bipolar percussion the objective piece of toolstone is placed on an anvil stone, and then the percussion force is applied to the tool stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roda Gilabert|first1=Xavier|last2=Mora|first2=Rafael|last3=Martínez-Moreno|first3=Jorge|title=Identifying bipolar knapping in the Mesolithic site of Font del Ros (northeast Iberia)|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2015|volume=370|issue=1682|pages=20140354|doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0354|pmc=4614717}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like projectile percussion, the tool stone is likely to shatter, rather than producing a single flake.  Unlike projectile percussion, the technique has some degree of control to it.  Bipolar percussion is not popular with hobbyists, but there is evidence that bipolar percussion was the preferred way of dealing with certain problems.  Bipolar percussion has the benefit of producing many sharp flakes, and triangular pieces of stone which can be useful as drills.  Bipolar percussion also does not require the manufacturer to locate a platform before setting to work, and bipolar percussion can produce sharp flakes almost the size of the original piece of tool stone.  The lack of control makes bipolar percussion undesirable in many situations, but the benefits mean that it often has a use, especially if workable material is rare.  Bipolar percussion is often used to break open small cobbles, or to have a second chance with spent lithic cores, broken bifaces, and tools that have been reworked so much that it is impossible to make further useful tools using traditional lithic reduction.  The end result of bipolar percussion is often a big mess, with only a few pieces that can be useful as cores or flakes for further working, but if other methods would result in a total dead-end, bipolar percussion may be desirable.

[[File:Bipolar Core.jpg|thumb|This image is an example of an obsidian core that has had flakes removed using bipolar percussion.]]

An alternative view of the bipolar reduction technique is offered by Jan Willem Van der Drift which contradicts the suggestion that there is little control over fracturing. The characteristics of bipolar reduction are different from that occurring in conchoidal fracture and are therefore often misinterpreted by archaeologists and lithic experts.

====Hard-hammer percussion====
Hard hammer techniques are generally used to remove large flakes of stone.  Early flintknappers and hobbyists replicating their methods often use cobbles of very hard stone, such as [[quartzite]].  This technique can be used by flintknappers to remove broad flakes that can be made into smaller tools.  This method of manufacture is believed to have been used to make some of the earliest stone tools ever found, some of which date from over 2 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Andrefsky 2005:31&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the use of hard-hammer percussion that most often results in the formation of the typical features of [[conchoidal fracture]] on the detached flake, such as the [[bulb of percussion]] and compression rings.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell and Kamminga 1987:986&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Soft Hammer.jpg|thumb|right|An example of soft hammer percussion]]

====Soft-hammer percussion====
Soft-hammer percussion involves the use of a billet, usually made of wood, bone  or antler as the percussor.  These softer materials are easier to shape than stone hammers, and therefore can be made into more precise tools.  Soft hammers also deform around the sharp edges of worked stone, rather than shattering through them, making it desirable for working tool stone that already has been worked to some degree before.  Soft hammers of course also do not have as much force behind them as hard hammers do.  Flakes produced by soft hammers are generally smaller and thinner than those produced by hard-hammer flaking; thus, soft-hammer flaking is often used after hard-hammer flaking in a lithic reduction sequence to do finer work.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell and Kamminga 1987:867&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as this, soft-hammers can produce longer flakes which aid in the conservation of materials because they produce a longer cutting edge per unit of mass lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pelcin|first1=A.|title=The effect of indentor type on flake attributes: evidence from a controlled experiment|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1997|volume=24|pages=613–621|doi=10.1006/jasc.1996.0145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, the amount of pressure applied to the objective piece in soft-hammer percussion is not enough for the formation of a typical conchoidal fracture.  Rather, soft-hammer flakes are most often produced by what is referred to as a bending fracture, so-called because the flake is quite literally bent or "peeled" from the objective piece. A bending fracture can be produced with a hard hammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pelcin|first1=A.|title=The Formation of Flakes: The Role of Platform Thickness and Exterior Platform Angle in the Production of Flake Initiations and Terminations|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1997|volume=24|pages=1107–1113|doi=10.1006/jasc.1996.0190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flakes removed in this manner lack a [[bulb of percussion]], and are distinguished instead by the presence of a small lip where the flake's striking platform has separated from the objective piece.&lt;ref&gt;Andrefsky 2005:18–20; Cotterell and Kamminga 1987:690&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indirect percussion====
Indirect percussion involves the use of a punch and hammer.  The punch and hammer make it possible to apply large force to very small areas of a stone tool.  Indirect percussion is therefore often used to achieve detail work on smaller tools.  Some modern hobbyists make use of indirect percussion almost exclusively, with little or no pressure flaking to finish their work.

Since indirect percussion can be so precisely placed, the platform is often much smaller on flakes produced in this way than in other methods of flake removal.  Of course, indirect percussion requires two hands to hold the percussing tool set.  One holds the hammer, and one holds the punch.  Therefore, modern hobbyists must use a third object in order to hold the targeted piece of tool stone while they strike it.  Often, some sort of clamp or vise is used.  No evidence for such devices has yet been found in the archaeological record, but this is partly because they would normally be made of perishable materials, and partly because they can have great variation in design.

===Pressure flaking===
[[Image:Pressure Flaking.jpg|thumb|right|An example of pressure flaking]] Pressure flaking is a method of trimming the edge of a [[stone tool]] by removing small [[lithic flake]]s by pressing on the stone with a sharp instrument rather than striking it with a percussor.  This method, which often uses punches made from bone or antler tines (or, among modern hobbyists, copper punches or even nails), provides a greater means of controlling the direction and quantity of the applied force than when using even the most careful percussive flaking. Copper retoucheurs to facilitate this process were widely employed in the [[Chalcolithic|Early Bronze Age]] – and may therefore be associated with [[Beaker culture|Beaker Culture]] in northwestern Europe.

Usually, the objective piece is held clasped in the flintknapper's hand, with a durable piece of fabric or leather protecting the flintknapper's palm from the sharpness of the flakes removed. The tip of the flaking tool is placed against the edge of the stone tool and pressed hard, removing a small linear or [[lunate]] flake from the opposite side.  The process also involves frequent preparation of the edge to form better platforms for pressing off  flakes.  This is usually accomplished with abraiders made from a coarse-grained stone such as [[basalt]] or [[quartzite]].  Great care must be taken during pressure flaking so that [[Termination type|perverse fractures]] that break the entire tool do not occur.  Occasionally, ''[[Termination type|outrepasse]]'' breaks occur when the force propagates across and through the tool in such a way that the entire opposite margin is removed.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell and Kamminga 1987:700–745&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of pressure flaking facilitated the early production of sharper and more finely detailed tools. Pressure flaking also gave toolmakers the ability to create notches where the objective piece could be bound more securely to the shaft of the [[weapon]] or [[tool]] and increasing the object's utility.

An archaeological discovery in 2010 in [[Blombos Cave]], [[South Africa]], places the use of pressure flaking by early humans to make stone tools back to 73,000 BCE, 55,000 years earlier than previously accepted.  The previously accepted date, "no more than 20,000 years ago",&lt;ref name="wired-20101029"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stone Agers Sharpened Skills 55,000 Years Earlier Than Thought|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=29 October 2010|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/stone-tool-sharpening/}}&lt;/ref&gt; was based upon the earliest evidence previously available, which derived from findings of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[Solutrean]] culture in [[France]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="allafrica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists Find Earliest Evidence of Method of Shaping Weapons|publisher=[[AllAfrica]]|author=Tamar Kahn|date=29 October 2010|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201010290156.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blanks and preforms ==
[[File:Préforme de hache 223.1 (4).jpg|thumb|Upper Neolithic axe-head preform]] 
A blank is a stone of suitable size and shape to be worked into a [[stone tool]]. Blanks are the starting point of a lithic reduction process, and during prehistoric times were often transported or traded for later refinement at another location.  Blanks might be stones or cobbles, just as natural processes have left them, or might be [[quarry|quarried]] pieces, or flakes that are debitage from making another piece.  Whatever their origin, on most definitions no further steps have yet been taken to shape them, or they become a preform.&lt;ref&gt;Kooyman, 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The next stage creates a '''preform''', or roughly shaped piece of stone, that probably reveals the final form of the tool, but is not complete.&lt;ref&gt;Kooyman, 47&lt;/ref&gt;  Preforms might also be transported or traded.  Typically, a preform is the shaped remnant of a [[lithic core]]. Larger and thicker than the intended tool, it lacks the final trimming and refinement that is present in the completed [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]].  Sometimes basic features such as stems and notches have been initiated.  In most cases, the term refers to an incomplete [[projectile point]].

'''Napata''' was a [[city-state]] of ancient [[Nubia]] on the west bank of the [[Nile]] at the site of modern [[Karima, Sudan]].

==Early history==
Napata was founded by [[Thutmose III]] in the 15th century BC after his conquest of [[Nubia]]. The nearby [[Jebel Barkal]] was taken to mark the southern border of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]].

In 1075 BC, the [[High Priests of Amun|High Priest of Amun]] at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], capital of Egypt, became powerful enough to limit the power of Pharaoh [[Smendes]] of the post-Ramesside [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first Dynasty]] over [[Upper Egypt]]. This was the beginning of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] (1075–664 BC). The fragmentation of power in Egypt allowed the Nubians to regain autonomy. They founded the [[Kingdom of Kush]], which was centered at Napata.

==Napatan period==
In 750 BC, Napata was a developed city, while Egypt was still suffering political instability. [[Kashta]], whose name is Egyptian for "the Kushite", profited from it, and attacked Upper Egypt. His policy was pursued by his successors [[Piye]], and [[Shabaka]] (721–707 BC), who eventually brought the whole Nile Valley under Kushitic control in the second year of his reign. Overall, the Kushite kings ruled Upper Egypt for approximately one century and the whole of Egypt for approximately 57 years, from 721 to 664 BC. They constitute the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]] in [[Manetho#Aegyptiaca|Manetho’s ''Aegyptiaca'']].

The reunited Egyptian empire under the 25th dynasty was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom and ushered in a renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diop|first=Cheikh Anta|title=The African Origin of Civilization|year=1974|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=1-55652-072-7|pages=219–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion, the arts, and architecture were restored to their Old, Middle, and New Kingdom forms. Pharaohs, such as [[Taharqa]], built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile, including at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], [[Karnak]], [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]], Jebel Barkal, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonnet|first=Charles|title=The Nubian Pharaohs|year=2006|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|location=New York|isbn=978-977-416-010-3|pages=142–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assyrian invasion and end of the Nubian dynasty===
Pharaoh Taharqa's reign and that of his eventual successor, his cousin [[Tantamani]], were filled with constant conflict with the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Around 670 BC, emperor [[Esarhaddon]] (681–669 BC) conquered Lower Egypt, but allowed local kingdoms there to exist in order to enlist them as his allies against the Kushite rulers of [[Upper Egypt]], who had been accepted with reluctance.

When King [[Ashurbanipal]] succeeded [[Esarhaddon]], the Kushite king [[Taharqa]] convinced some rulers of Lower Egypt to break with Assyrians. However, Assurbanipal overpowered the coalition and deported the Egyptian leaders to his capital, [[Nineveh]]. He appointed the [[Libu|Libyan]] chief Necho, ruler of Memphis and [[Sais, Egypt|Saïs]]. [[Necho I]] was the first king of the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] (664–525 BC) of Egypt, which is also known as the "Saïte Dynasty".

In 664 BC, the Assyrians laid the final blow, sacking Thebes and Memphis. The same year, Taharqa died. The new Kushite king, Tantamani (664–653 BC), killed Necho I that same year when he tried to invade Lower Egypt. However, Tantamani was unable to defeat the Assyrians, who backed Necho’s son, [[Psamtik I]]. Tantamani eventually abandoned his attempt to conquer Lower Egypt and retreated to Napata. However, his authority over Upper Egypt was acknowledged until the 8th regnal year of his reign at Thebes (or 656 BC), when Psamtik I dispatched a naval fleet to Upper Egypt and succeeded in placing all of Egypt under his control.

The 25th dynasty ended with its rulers retreating to Napata. It was there (at [[El-Kurru]] and [[Nuri]]) that all 25th dynasty pharaohs are buried under the first pyramids that the Nile valley had seen since the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=0-520-06697-9|pages=161–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emberling|first=Geoff|title=Nubia: Ancient Kingdoms of Africa|year=2011|publisher=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World|location=New York|isbn=978-0-615-48102-9 |pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=David|title=Ancient Egypt|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-521270-3|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Napatan dynasty continued to rule the Kushite state, which flourished in Napata and [[Meroë]] until at least the second century AD.

==Late Napatan kingdom==

[[File:Nuri main pyr.northeast.jpg|thumb|right|Nuri pyramids]]

Napata remained the centre of the [[Kingdom of Kush]] for another two generations, from the 650s to 590 BC. Its economy was essentially based on gold, with 26th dynasty Egypt an important economic ally. 

Napatan [[Nubian architecture|architecture]], paintings, writing script, and other artistic and cultural forms were in Kush style. Egyptian burial customs were practised, including the resurrection of pyramid building. Also, several [[ancient Egyptian deities]] were worshipped. The most important god was [[Amun]], a Theban deity, and the [[Temple of Amun, Jebel Barkal|Temple of Amun]] was the most important at Napata, located at the foot of [[Jebel Barkal]].&lt;ref&gt;World Studies The Ancient World Chapter 3 Section 5 Pages 100, 101 and 102&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Achaemenid conquest of Egypt, Napata lost its economic influence. The Napatan region itself was desiccating, leading to less cattle and agriculture. An Achaemenid raid had seriously affected Napata in 591 BC. Finally, Napata was losing its role of economic capital to Meroë. The island of Meroë, the peninsula formed by the Nile and the [[Atbarah River]], was an area rich in iron, which was becoming an essential source of wealth. Meroe eventually became the capital of the Kingdom of Kush, leading to the abandonment of Napata.

In 23 BC, the [[List of governors of Roman Egypt|Governor of Roman Egypt]] invaded Kush after an initial attack by the queen of Meröe, razing Napata to the ground. In the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' ("Deeds of the Divine Augustus"), [[Augustus]] claims that "a penetration was made as far as the town of Napata, which is next to Meroe[.]"&lt;ref&gt;Augustus, "The Deeds of the Divine Augustus," ''Exploring the European Past: Texts &amp; Images'', Second Edition, ed. Timothy E. Gregory (Mason: Thomson, 2008), 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Napata was mentioned in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Aida]]'' (1871) in Act III, when Amonasro uses Aida to learn where Rhadames will lead his army.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23608">The '''Neo-Concrete Movement''' (1959–61) was a Brazilian art movement, which developed from [[Rio de Janeiro]]’s [[Grupo Frente]], a coalition of artists working in [[Concrete Art]]. Neoconcrete artists rejected the pure rationalist approach of concrete art and embraced a more phenomenological and less scientific art. [[Ferreira Gullar]] inspired Neo-Concrete philosophy through his essay “Theory of the Non-Object” (1959) and wrote the “Neo-Concrete Manifesto” (1959) which outlines what Neo-Concrete art should be. [[Lygia Clark]], [[Hélio Oiticica]], and [[Lygia Pape]] were among the primary leaders of this movement.

== Background ==
After [[World War One]], Europe witnessed a boom of art movements based upon rationalism such as [[De Stijl]] and [[Bauhaus]]. Artists believed humanity would be able to achieve progress through its ability to reason. In Latin America, ideas of rationalist and non-objective art took root in the early 1950s in reaction to the muralism controversy.&lt;ref name=LatinAmericanArt20thCentury-2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lucie-Smith|first1=Edward|title=Latin American Art of the 20th Century|date=2004|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-20356-9|pages=121, 137|oclc=57007345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments such as the Mexican government utilized muralists to create propaganda. Under repressive Latin American governments, artists rebelled against the idea of aiding the political regime through figurative art; therefore geometric abstraction and concretism ushered in an art that did not connote anything political or have really any meaning at all.

[[Concrete Art]] was able to flourish beneath these repressive regimes because it held no political messages or incendiary material.&lt;ref name=LatinAmericanArt20thCentury-2004 /&gt; In Brazil, ideas of rationalist art and geometric abstraction arose in the early 1950s following the establishment of a democratic republic in 1946.  The period from 1946 to 1964 is known as the [[Second Brazilian Republic]].&lt;ref name ="Flynn"&gt;Flynn, Peter. Flynn, Peter. ''Nations of the Modern World, Brazil: A Political Analysis''. Boulder: Westview Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as Grupo Ruptura in [[Sao Paulo]] and Grupo Frente in Rio de Janeiro rose. Specifically Ruptura followed the ideal of pure [[mathematical art]] which does not connote meaning outside of what it is.&lt;ref name ="Balderston"&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Latin American and Caribbean Cultures''. Ed. Daniel Balderston, Mike Gonzalez, and Ana M. Lopez. London: Routledge, 2002. 1032.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neo-Concrete art movement arose when Grupo Frente realized that Concretism was “naïve and somewhat colonialist” and an “overly rational conception of abstract structure.”&lt;ref name ="Brett"&gt;Brett, Guy. "Lygia Clark and Helio Oiticica." ''Latin American Artists of the Nineteenth Century.'' New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1993. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 as the political tides began to turn, the Neo-Concrete artists disbanded no longer content to limit themselves to this one philosophy. [[Lygia Clark]] and [[Hélio Oiticica]], leaders of the Neo-Concrete movement, put their energy into Conceptual Art. Art historians often refer to Neo-Concretism as the precursor to Conceptual Art because of the foundation of “abstruse metaphysics.”&lt;ref name=LatinAmericanArt20thCentury-2004 /&gt; On April 1, 1964, a military coup removed [[Joao Goulart]] and established a military government in Brazil until 1985.&lt;ref name="Flynn"/&gt; The increase of violence called for a new kind of art that had the potential to carry meaning and deconstruct traditional thought even further. This came in the form of [[Conceptual Art]].

== The Neo-Concrete Manifesto and the push against Concretism ==
Brazilian poet and writer [[Ferreira Gullar]] wrote the Neo-Concrete Manifesto in 1959 and described a work of art as “something which amounts to more than the sum of its constituent elements; something which analysis may break down into various elements but which can only be understood phenomenologically.”&lt;ref name ="Gullar"&gt;Gullar, Ferreira. “Neo-Concrete Manifesto.” ''History of Modern Latin American Art Course Reader.'' Spokane: Whitworth University, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the Concrete Art movement, Gullar was calling for an art that was not based upon rationalism or in pursuit of pure form. He sought works of art that became active once the viewer was involved. Neo-concrete art must disassemble the limitations of the object and “express complex human realities.”&lt;ref name ="Gullar"/&gt;

While Concretism built its art upon the basis of logic and objective knowledge with color, space, and form conveying universalism and objectivity, the Neo-Concrete artists saw colors, space, and form as “not [belonging] to this or that artistic language, but to the living and indeterminate experience of man.”&lt;ref name ="Amor"&gt;Amor, Monica. “From Work to Frame, In Between, and Beyond: Lygia Clark and Hélio Oiticica, 1959–1964.” ''Grey Room'' 38 (Winter 2010): 20-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Neo-Concrete Art still maintained Concretism as the foundation for their ideas, Neo-Concretists believed objectivity and mathematical principles alone could not accomplish the Concretist goal of creating a transcendental visual language.

Neo-Concretists believed that artworks were not simply static representations or forms; rather “art should be like living organisms” &lt;ref name ="Brett"/&gt; In Lygia Clark’s theoretical statement written to address the intentions of the Neo-Concrete artists, she explains that as artists they wish to “found a new, expressive ‘space’.”&lt;ref name ="Bois"&gt;Bois, Yve-Alain and Lygia Clark. “Nostalgia of the Body.” ''The MIT Press 69'' (Summer 1994): 85-109.&lt;/ref&gt; This movement believed that through a direct relationship between the artwork and the viewer this “new, expressive ‘space’” could be constructed.&lt;ref name ="Bois"/&gt; Neo-Concrete artists sought to create a multi-sensorial space which caused the spectator to feel more acutely their own body and existence.

Clark also wrote of how Neo-Concretism sought to decipher the nature of humanity by creating a “medium of expression” which allowed people to “become aware of unity as an organic, living whole.”&lt;ref name ="Clark"&gt;Clark, Lygia. “1960: Death of the Plane.” ‘’October’’ 69 (Summer 1994): 96.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not just restoring an awareness of the spectator’s body but also of humanity’s communal existence.

The first Neo-Concrete Exhibition was held in Rio de Janeiro in March 1959, and the exhibiting artists were [[Amilcar de Castro]], [[Ferreira Gullar]], [[Franz Weissmann]], [[Lygia Clark]], [[Lygia Pape]], [[Reynaldo_Jardim]], and [[Theon Spanudis]].&lt;ref name ="Bois"/&gt;

== ''Neo-Concrete Manifesto'' ==
This manifesto was written by [[Ferreira Gullar]], and was signed by [[Amilcar de Castro]], [[Ferreira Gullar]], [[Franz Weissmann]], [[Lygia Clark]], [[Lygia Pape]], [[Reynaldo Jardim]] and [[Theon Spanudis]]. It was published on 22 of March 1959 in ''Journal do Brazil.''

We use the term “neo-concrete” to differentiate ourselves from those committed to non-figurative “[[geometric art|geometric]]” art ([[neo-plasticism]], [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[suprematism]], [[Ulm School of Design|Ulm School]]) and in particular the kind of concrete art that is influenced by a dangerously extreme rationalism. Compelled by their experiences, the painters, sculptors, engravers, and writers participating in this First Neo-concrete Exhibition came to the conclusion that it was necessary to revise the theoretical principles on which concrete art has been founded, none of which offers a rationale for the expressive potential they feel their art contains.

Born with [[cubism]], as a reaction against the impressionist disintegration of poetic language, it was natural that so-called geometric art should situate itself in a position diametrically opposed to the technical and allusive resources of ordinary painting. The new achievements of physics and mechanics, in opening up a wide perspective for objective thought, encouraged, among those who continued this revolution, the tendency towards an everincreasing rationalization of the processes and purposes of painting. A mechanicalist notion of construction invaded the language of painters and sculptors, generating, in turn, equally extreme responses of a reactionary nature, such as [[magic realism|magical]] or irrationalist [[realism (arts)|realism]], [[Dada art|Dada]], or [[surrealism]]. Therefore, there is no doubt that the true artists—as is the case with, for example, [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] or [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]]—constructed their works following those theories that consecrated [[scientific objectivity]] and mechanical precision, but in that hand-to-hand combat with expression they overcame the limits imposed by theory. Yet the work of those artists has been interpreted to this day from theoretical positions that that same work denied. We propose a reinterpretation of neo-plasticism, constructivism, and other similar movements, basing ourselves on their expressive successes and making the work of art take precedence over theory. If we were to attempt to understand Mondrian’s painting starting from his theories, we would be forced to choose one over the other. We either find the prophecy of the complete integration of art in daily life to be possible (and we see in Mondrian’s work the first steps in that direction), or we view that integration as ever more remote, in which case his work seems to have failed. Either the vertical and the horizontal are truly the fundamental rhythms of the universe, and Mondrian’s oeuvre is the application of that universal principle, or the principle fails, and his work turns out to be based on an illusion. But the truth is that Mondrian’s work is there, alive and fertile, above these theoretical contradictions. It is useless to view Mondrian as the destroyer of the surface, of the plane and the line, if we do not perceive the new space that that destruction constructed.

The same can be said of [[Georges Vantongerloo|Vantongerloo]] or Pevsner. It does not matter what mathematical equations are at the root of a sculpture or a painting by Vantongerloo, because only in the experience of its direct perception does the work provide the “meaning” of its rhythms and colors. Whether Pevsner started from figures of descriptive geometry or not is irrelevant, when one confronts the new space that his sculptures generate and the cosmic-organic expression that, through it, its forms reveal. Determining the ways in which artistic objects and scientific instruments, or the artist’s intuition and the physicist’s and engineer’s objective thought, converged may be interesting from a cultural standpoint, but from an aesthetic standpoint, the work of art provokes interest precisely because of what it possesses that transcends these external circumstances—because of the universe of existential meanings that merge and are revealed in the work of art.

[[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], having recognized the superiority of “pure perception in art,” placed his theoretical definitions in a position that was safe from the limitations of rationalism and mechanicalism, projecting a transcendent dimension in his paintings that guarantees him a notable relevance today. But Malevich’s daring cost him dearly, in simultaneously opposing both figurative art and mechanicalist abstraction, for to this day certain rationalist theoreticians consider him a naïf who did not understand the true sense of the new plastic arts … In fact, Malevich already expressed, within “geometric” painting, his dissatisfaction, his desire to transcend the rational and the sensorial, which today is undeniably manifest.

Neo-concretism, emerging out of the need to express the complex reality of modern man with the structural language of the new plastic arts, denies the validity of the attitudes espoused by scientificism and positivism in art and reconsiders the problem of expression, incorporating the new “verbal” dimensions created by constructive, non-figurative art. Rationalism divests art of all autonomy and substitutes the untransferable qualities of the work of art with notions of scientific objectivity. Thus, the concepts of form, space, time, and structure—which in the arts are linked to an existential meaning, emotive and affective—are confused with their theoretical application by science. In fact, in the name of preconceived ideas that today’s philosophy denounces ([[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|M. Merleau-Ponty]], [[Ernst Cassirer|E. Cassirer]], [[Susanne Katherina Langer|S. Langer]])—and that are collapsing in every field, starting with modern biology, which has overcome Pavlovian mechanicalism—the concretist-rationalists still view man as a machine among machines and attempt to limit art to the expression of that theoretical reality.

We do not conceive of art either as a “machine” or as an “object” but as a quasi-corpus, that is, an entity whose reality is not exhausted in the external relationships
of its elements; an entity that, though analytically divisible into its parts, only gives itself up fully to a direct, phenomenological approach. We believe that the work of art overcomes the material mechanism upon which it rests, not due to some virtue lying outside this Earth: it overcomes it by transcending those mechanical relationships (which is the object of Gestalt theory) and by creating for itself a tacit signification (Merleau-Ponty) that emerges in it for the first time. If we had to search for a simile for the work of art, we could not find it, therefore, either in a machine or in objects taken objectively, but rather, as S. Langer and [[Vladimir Weidlé|V. Wleidlé]] [sic] argue, in living organisms. Furthermore, this comparison would not be sufficient to express the specific reality of the aesthetic organism.

Since the work of art is not limited to occupying a place in objective space—but rather transcends it in basing a new signification in it—the objective notions of time, space, form, structure, color, etc. are not sufficient to understand the work of art, to fully explain its “reality.” The lack of an adequate terminology for expressing a world that does not succumb to notions led art critics indiscriminately to employ words that are unfaithful to the complexity of the created work. The influence of technology and science was manifest here as well, to the degree that today, with their roles reversed, certain artists, confused by that terminology, attempt to make art starting from these objective notions in order to apply them as a creative method. Inevitably, the artists who work in this fashion only reveal a priori notions, since they are constrained by a method that already prescribes the results of their work before they begin. By avoiding intuitive creation, by reducing himself to an objective body in an objective space, with his paintings the rationalist concrete artist hardly demands, from himself and from the viewer, a stimulating and reflexive reaction. He speaks to the eye as an instrument and not to the eye as a human means of possessing the world and of giving oneself to it; he speaks to the machine-eye and not the body-eye.

Given that the work of art transcends mechanical space, the notions of cause and effect lose all validity in it, and the notions of time, space, form, and color are integrated
in such a way—since they lacked any existence, as those notions, prior to the work—that it would be impossible to speak of them as elements that can be broken down. Neo-concrete art, affirming the absolute integration of these elements, vouches for the ability of its “geometric” vocabulary to assume the expression of complex human realities, manifest in many works by Mondrian, Malevich, Pevsner, Gabo, Sofia Taeuber-Arp, etc. If even these artists at times confused the concept of mechanical form with expressive form, it is important to clarify that, in the language of art, these so-called geometric forms lose the objective character of geometry in order to become vehicles for the imagination. Gestalt theory, in that it is still a psychology based on the concept of causation, also proves insufficient in helping us understand that phenomenon that dissolves the causally definable realities of space and form and presents them as time, as the spatialization of the work. By “spatialization of the work” is meant the fact that it is continually making itself present,
it is always regaining the impulse that generated it and of which it was, in turn, the origin. And if this description remits us likewise to the first—full—experience of the real, that is because neo-concrete art seeks nothing more than to revive that experience. Neo-concrete art creates a new expressive space.

This position is equally valid for neo-concrete poetry, which condemns in concrete poetry the same mechanicalist objectivism of painting. The rationalist concrete poets also established the imitation of the machine as an ideal for their art. For them, too, space and time are but external relationships between object-words. Now, if that is the case, the page is reduced to a graphic space and the word to an element of that space. As in painting, the visual here is reduced to the optical, and the poem does not transcend the graphic dimension. Neo-concrete poetry rejects such spurious notions and, faithful to the very nature of language, reaffirms the poem as a temporal entity. In time and space, the word unfolds its complex signifying nature. The page in neo-concrete poetry is the spatialization of verbal time: it is pause, silence, time. It is evidently not a matter of returning to the concept of time that characterizes discursive poetry; for while language flows in succession in discursive poetry, in concrete poetry language opens up in duration. Therefore, unlike rationalist concretism, which views the word as object and transforms it into a mere optical signal, neo-concrete poetry restores it to its condition as “verbum,” that is, to the human mode of presentation of the real. In neo-concrete poetry, language does not slip away, but rather remains.

In its turn, neo-concrete prose, opening up a new field for expressive experiments, recovers language as flux, overcoming its syntactical contingencies and giving new, fuller meaning to certain solutions that until now were erroneously accepted as poetry. This is how, in painting as in poetry, in prose as in sculpture and printmaking, neo-concrete art reaffirms the independence of artistic creation in the face of objective knowledge (science) and practical knowledge (ethics, politics, industry, etc.).

The participants in this First Neo-concrete Exhibition do not constitute a “group.” They are not united by dogmatic principles. The evident affinity of their explorations in various fields has brought them together and led them to meet here. The commitment that obliges them commits each one of them, first and foremost, to their individual experience; they will remain together as long as the deep affinity that brought them together endures.

[[File:The Oriental Research Institute &amp; Manuscripts Library at Thiruvananthapuram.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Oriental Research Institute]]
The '''Oriental Research Institute &amp; Manuscripts Library''' (ORI &amp; MSS), in the [[University of Kerala]], is one of the leading centres of [[Indology|Indological Studies]] in India. This world recognised institute, situated in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] ([[Trivandrum]]), does [[research]] in  fields connected with [[manuscript]]s. The department is microfilming the manuscripts of certain technical subjects.

==History==
The genesis of this library is to be traced to the orders of [[Ayilyam Thirunal]], [[Maharaja of Travancore]] to collect all manuscripts in the state so as to be kept in the safe custody of the Palace Library. Considering the overwhelming enthusiasm from the Orientalists all over the world, during early nineteen hundred [[Swathi Thirunal]] Maharaja (the then King of Travancore) published many of the manuscripts in the Palace Library and the manuscripts collection of ancient families.

ORI &amp; MSS is a treasure trove of Indian culture. The library has over 70,000 works in 30,000 copies mainly of palm leaf manuscripts. In addition, some paper [[manuscript]]s, a few [[intaglio printing|copper plates]], writings on Bhurjapatra ([[birch bark]]), Agarutvak (the bark of ''[[Aquilaria malaccensis]]'') and textiles are also found in the collection. The manuscript collection also includes those belonging to other different [[India]]n states and nations such as [[Burma]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Nepal]] etc. Another interesting fact is that about eighty per cent of the collections are in [[Sanskrit]]. The manuscript collection of this department is an invaluable source for the study of ancient scripts as [[Grantha alphabet|Grantha]], Vattezhuttu, Sarada, Nandinagari, Grantha [[Tamil script|Tamil]] etc. The initial moulds of scripts of modern Indian languages like [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Burmese language|Burmese]] are also found.

===Curators of the library===
In 1908 [[T. Ganapati Sastri]] became the curator of this library.&lt;ref name="raja"&gt;The contribution of Kerala to Sanskrit Literature; K.Kunjunni Raja; University of Madras 1980; page 257, 272&lt;/ref&gt;
Sambasiva Sastri succeeded Ganapati Sastri as the curator of this library.He wrote Citrabhyudaya Kavya about Travancore king.&lt;ref name="raja"&gt;The contribution of Kerala to Sanskrit Literature; K.Kunjunni Raja; University of Madras 1980; page 257, 272&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hours of Operation==

The Oriental Research Institute and Manuscripts Library is open from 8 am to 8 pm all working days and from 2 pm to 8 pm on Sundays.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3203">'''Parody science''', sometimes called '''spoof science''', is the act of mocking [[science]] in a satirical way. Science can be parodied for a purpose, ranging from social commentary and making political points, to humor for its own sake.

Parody science is different from science humor or from real science that happens to be humorous, in that parody science has little or no basis in real science.

'''Plas Mawr''' ({{lang-en|Great Hall}})&lt;ref name=Turner2008P3/&gt; is an [[Elizabethan architecture|Elizabethan]] townhouse in [[Conwy]], [[North Wales]], dating from the 16th century. The property was built by [[Robert Wynn (MP)|Robert Wynn]], a member of the local gentry, following his marriage to his first wife, Dorothy Griffith. Plas Mawr occupied a plot of land off Conwy's High Street and was constructed in three phases between 1576 and 1585 at a total cost of around £800.{{efn|name=Money|Converting 16th century sums of money into modern equivalents is highly challenging. For comparison, Robert Wynn was probably earning around £110 a year during the 1570s, and £220 by the 1590s.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 195"&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Wynn was known for his hospitality, and the household was supported by Wynn's local dairy herds, orchards and gardens. On his death he laid out complex instructions for dividing his estate; the resulting law-case took years to resolve, effectively preventing the redevelopment of the house and preserving it in its original condition.

After 1683 Plas Mawr passed into the hands of the Mostyn family and ceased to be used as a family home. It was rented out for various purposes during the 18th and 19th centuries, including for use as a school, cheap lodgings and finally as the headquarters of the [[Royal Cambrian Academy of Art]]. In the 20th century the house became increasingly well known for its preserved Elizabethan architecture, but the costs of maintenance grew considerably and its condition deteriorated. The Welsh heritage agency [[Cadw]] took over the management of the property in 1993 and carried out an extensive, 42-month-long restoration project at a total cost of £3.3 million. With many of its rooms redecorated to resemble their condition in 1665, and replanted Renaissance gardens, it is now run as a tourist attraction.

Architecturally, Plas Mawr is almost unchanged from the 16th century, and the historian Rick Turner considers the house to be "the finest surviving town house of the Elizabethan era".&lt;ref name=Turner2008P3&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plas Mawr shows a blend of continental [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and local North Wales influences, with an innovative floor-plan and architectural detailing. The house still retains much of its original plasterwork, which incorporates symbols, badges and heraldry, which the historian Peter Smith has described as "the most perfect and the most complete memorial to Elizabethan Wales."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1988|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture of the house influenced other contemporary projects in North Wales, and was later copied during the 19th and 20th centuries in buildings around the town of Conwy, including the local police station and nearby hotel.

==History==

===16th – 17th centuries===

Plas Mawr was built in the town of Conwy between 1576 and 1585 by [[Robert Wynn (MP)|Robert Wynn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=3–5, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert came from a prosperous local family and entered the service of first Sir [[Walter Stonor]] and then Sir [[Philip Hoby]], both administrators and senior officials to King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert fought and was injured at the [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544–1546)|Siege of Boulogne]] in 1544, took part in military campaigns in Scotland and traveled extensively across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He invested in land across North Wales and married his first wife, Dorothy Griffith, a member of the local gentry, in 1570.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once married, Robert needed a suitable house and chose to settle in Conwy, a prosperous town that was known in the 16th century for its genteel society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=7}}; {{cite web| url=http://www.conwy.gov.uk/upload/public/attachments/374/Conwy_CAA.pdf| mode=cs2| title=Conwy: Conservation Area Appraisal| accessdate=6 September 2013| last=Conwy County Borough Council| publisher=Conwy County Borough Council| page=4| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410152551/http://www.conwy.gov.uk/upload/public/attachments/374/Conwy_CAA.pdf| archivedate=10 April 2015| df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Detail of roof of Plas Mawr.JPG|thumb|left| The roof above the great chamber, with [[Timber roof truss|arch-braced collar trusses]] joined using "double pegging"]]
In 1570, Robert paid Hugh Mershe £200 for an existing "mansion house" in Conwy, positioned in the middle of a [[burgage]] plot on what is now Crown Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=7, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money}} More land to the north of this was purchased from a Richard Peake in 1576 for £40, and work then began on the north wing of Plas Mawr, which was completed by the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=11–13}}; {{harvnb|Turner|1995|pp=180, 194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mershe's former house was pulled down to allow the preparation of the foundations of the rest of the building, including the digging of fresh drains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert lived in the completed north wing until 1580, when the central and south ranges were built, finishing the main part of Plas Mawr.&lt;ref name=Turner2008PP1113&gt;Turner pp.11–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert went on to rent further land around the north of Plas Mawr.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=41}}; {{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land at the south end of the burgage, however, facing onto the High Street, belonged to a Robert Laythwood, who had a house there.&lt;ref name=Turner2008PP1113/&gt; Wynne purchased this in 1585, probably for the relatively high price of £40, and demolished it to enable the final phase of development, using the space to build a gatehouse that formed the new entrance to Plas Mawr.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=11–13}}; {{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further small pieces of land were bought on the north-west side of the house and converted into an ornamental garden, bringing the total cost of the land to around £300.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=41}}; {{harvnb|Turner|1995|pp=182, 195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the grandest Elizabethan town house in Wales at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These three phases of house construction – 1576–77, 1580 and 1585 – were probably [[Project management|overseen]] by several different senior craftsmen, possibly working to an original plan determined by a surveyor or mason working at the English royal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=12}}; {{harvnb|Smith|1988|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judging by the details of the roof design, a single master carpenter may have been used for all three parts of the build; he probably worked elsewhere across the region during these years, including on 15 other houses and two churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the first two phases of work  were probably conducted by the same team of plasterers, possibly from London, and they used as much as {{convert|100000|kg|adj=on}} of lime plaster on the rendering.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timber]] and [[slate]]s were brought down the [[Conwy valley]] for the house, with grey [[Silurian]] [[Gritstone|grit]] rubble quarried from the hills near the town, and finer [[sandstone]] brought from nearby [[Deganwy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=12–14}}; {{harvnb|Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|1956|p=58}}; {{cite web| url=http://www.conwy.gov.uk/upload/public/attachments/374/Conwy_CAA.pdf| mode=cs2| title=Conwy: Conservation Area Appraisal| accessdate=6 September 2013| last=Conwy County Borough Council| publisher=Conwy County Borough Council| page=6| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410152551/http://www.conwy.gov.uk/upload/public/attachments/374/Conwy_CAA.pdf| archivedate=10 April 2015| df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The total of the building work was probably around £500.&lt;ref name="Turner 1995 195"/&gt;

Entertainment and hospitality were important to a gentleman's 16th-century social status and, according to his nephew, the [[antiquarian]] [[Sir John Wynn, 1st Baronet|John Wynn]], Robert Wynn kept a "worthy plentiful house".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The household was supported by milk from Wynn's own dairy herds, and by food from the orchards, gardens and a [[fish trap]] that he owned around the town.&lt;ref name=Turner2008P25&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house had its own brewing, baking and dairy facilities, and further supplies were bought in from regional merchants.&lt;ref name=Turner2008P25/&gt;

Dorothy died in 1586 and Robert married Dorothy Dymock, with whom he had seven children at Plas Mawr.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Robert died in 1598 he left a complex will that led to legal disputes between the family and the executor, Sir [[Roger Mostyn]].&lt;ref name="Turner 2008 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal case effectively halted any further development of the house, by now the most prominent in Conwy, until its resolution in 1630.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=11, 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property passed to Robert's grandson, another Robert Wynn, in 1637, and onto his daughter, Elin in 1683.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1665, the house was equipped to a quality and style that would have put it only just behind the houses of the major gentry families in Caernarfonshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elin then married into the Wynne family, and made little use of the house, and it ultimately passed by marriage into the Mostyn family.&lt;ref name=Turner2008P18&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th – 19th centuries===
The Mostyns' principal residence was [[Mostyn Hall]] in Flintshire and so the family rented out Plas Mawr to various tenants during the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Haslam|2006|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century the gatehouse was used as a [[courthouse]] and the main house as cheap housing.&lt;ref name=Turner2008P18/&gt; In the 19th century, parts of the house were converted into a school and space for other small businesses, as well as still being used for domestic accommodation: in 1881, the house had 25 residents.&lt;ref name=Turner2008P18/&gt; Minor changes were made to Plas Mawr in the process, such as the installation of partition walls to subdivide the larger rooms, but it remained largely intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mostyns offered the house for sale in 1870, as part of a package of land including [[Bodysgallen Hall]], but there were no offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haslam|2006|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1880s, the [[Royal Cambrian Academy of Art]] became concerned about the condition of Plas Mawr, and  in 1887 [[Edward Lloyd-Mostyn, 2nd Baron Mostyn|Lord Mostyn]] agreed to lease the building to the Academy for use as their headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architects Arthur and [[Herbert Baker]] were commissioned to survey the building, conduct repairs and remove some of the post-17th century alterations, and J. R. Furness then carried out conservation work on much of the plasterwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Victoria Gallery was built onto the north-west side of the house to hold artistic exhibitions, and a [[weather vane]] was added to the top of the building to celebrate [[Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th – 21st centuries===
{{double image|right|Central tower of Plas Mawr.JPG|260|View from Plas Mawr.JPG|150|Central tower (left) and view from the tower onto the lower terrace, upper courtyard and the north wing (right)}}
By the early 20th century, Plas Mawr's historical significance was increasingly well understood, but the costs of maintaining the house grew considerably.&lt;ref name=Turner2008P21&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the century, the finer sandstone had corroded and the timber beams were deteriorating; a 1956 survey described them as "much decayed".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|1964|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaster ceilings were bowing and coming away from their timbers.&lt;ref name=Turner2008P21/&gt; The Academy of Art sought government and private assistance to undertake temporary and partial repairs, but these were insufficient and in 1993 it moved into new accommodation and the property was passed into the control of the state, under the management of the Welsh heritage agency [[Cadw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Humphries|2006|pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadw carried out a major restoration project on the house over the next 42 months, combining large scale conservation with detailed surveying and archaeological analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Humphries|2006|pp=77, 79}}; {{harvnb|Robinson|2008|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century Victoria Galley was demolished in 1995, and the bare, external stonework was re-rendered and [[lime wash]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=20}}; {{cite web| url=http://www.conwy.gov.uk/upload/public/attachments/374/Conwy_CAA.pdf| mode=cs2| title=Conwy: Conservation Area Appraisal| accessdate=6 September 2013| last=Conwy County Borough Council| publisher=Conwy County Borough Council| page=6| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410152551/http://www.conwy.gov.uk/upload/public/attachments/374/Conwy_CAA.pdf| archivedate=10 April 2015| df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Large parts of the property were restored as they might have appeared in 1665, assisted by the record of Robert Wynn the younger's will, with the exception of the attic, which was restored to its probable 19th-century appearance.&lt;ref name=HumphriesP77&gt;{{harvnb|Humphries|2006|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of this was to emphasize the colour and comfort of the original building, to prevent it appearing inauthentically bleak and austere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kightly|2008|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Chamber is available for wedding ceremonies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Weddings and wedding photography |url=http://cadw.gov.wales/venuehire/weddingsandweddingphotography/?lang=en |website=Cadw |publisher=Cadw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sections of the house were redeveloped to hold exhibition displays and other visitor facilities.&lt;ref name=HumphriesP77/&gt; 

The restoration included installing original and replica interior furnishings, using wall hangings woven from [[Kidderminster stuff]] and [[Dornix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Humphries|2006|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what historical consultant Charles Kightly has praised as a "brave and successful" decision, much of the plasterwork was repainted, using reversible techniques, to resemble its 17th-century condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Humphries|2006|p=78}}; {{harvnb|Kightly|2008|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total the project cost £3.3 million, and won the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] Building Conservation Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Humphries|2006|p=79}}; {{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further work followed in 2006 to restore the gardens, again attempting to replicate the style prevalent in 1665.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century the house is operated as a tourist attraction by Cadw. The historian Rick Turner considers Plas Mawr to be "the finest surviving town house of the Elizabethan era" and it is protected under UK law as a Grade I [[listed building]] and as a [[scheduled monument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=3}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-3634-plas-mawr-conwy/photos| title=Plas Mawr, Conwy  | accessdate=6 September 2013 | mode = cs2|publisher=British Listed Buildings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecturally, Plas Mawr is almost unchanged from the 16th century, making it a very rare survival from this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural style is a product of the broader [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance influences]] prevalent across Europe at the time.&lt;ref name=Turner2008PP32&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Wynn spent time in Germany, and the style of Plas Mawr makes use of North German [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] themes, particularly in its use of [[Symmetry#In architecture|symmetry]], the [[pediment]]ed windows at the front of the house, faceted [[finial]]s and [[crow-stepped gable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=31}}; {{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=191}}; {{harvnb|Smith|1988|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features were already popular in England when the house was built, and indeed Plas Mawr is very similar in design to [[Eastbury Manor House]], the two possibly being based off the same architectural plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1988|pp=229, 244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these features had already begun to spread into Wales – crow-stepped gables, for example, were already being used in [[Flintshire]] by the 1580s – but others were ground breaking in Wales, such as the use of [[ovolo]]-moulded and [[dormer]] windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1988|pp=267, 663}}; {{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Robert Wynn was only an emerging member of the gentry, and his house was not as large or as sophisticated as contemporary grander Renaissance properties built in larger rural settings.&lt;ref name=Turner2008PP32/&gt;

Some of the house's architecture also reflects the influences from contemporary buildings across North Wales, in particular [[Gwydir Castle]], built by Robert Wynn's father [[John "Wynn" ap Maredudd|John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plas Mawr lacks a fashionable [[long gallery]], for example, which was popular in England at the time, and was already beginning to appear in Welsh houses.&lt;ref name=Turner1995P184/&gt; Instead, it has a rear turret, or belvedere, which is raised prominently above the height of the rest of the house, overlooking the town: this was a slightly antiquated feature, but was widely used in other Wynn family properties, including Bodysgallen Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1988|p=231}}; {{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=191}}; {{harvnb|Haslam|2006|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of Plas Mawr influenced other buildings in North Wales at the time, including the redecoration of Gwydir Castle, [[Maenan Hall]] further up the Conwy valley, Plas Mawr in [[Caernarfon]] and [[Hen Blas]] in [[Beaumaris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=34}}; {{harvnb|Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|1964|p=clxx}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also later shaped the architecture of 19th- and 20th-century buildings in Conwy itself, surviving examples of which include the town's police station and the Castlebank Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Layout===
[[File:PlasMawrKitchen.jpg|thumb|Restored kitchen and ''[[batterie de cuisine]]'']]
Modern visitors typically enter the house from the High Street to the south, passing through the gatehouse, across the lower courtyard into the hall of the main building. Plas Mawr's gatehouse was only the third such entrance building to be built in North Wales, despite gatehouses being an important part of English Elizabethan architecture, designed to show off the house and provide a suitably dignified entry for visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=32}}; {{harvnb|Smith|1988|pp=230–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few houses in towns had the physical space for a gatehouse like Plas Mawr's.&lt;ref name="Turner 2008 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the gatehouse would have contained a suite of rooms for the steward of the house, Richard Wynn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main house forms an "H"-shape, with a north and a south wing joined in the middle, all facing onto an upper courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1988|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper courtyard was key to the way that the main house functioned: it linked almost all the ground floor rooms in the house, as well as providing access to the cellars, and gave an impressive view of the turret towers.&lt;ref name=Turner1995P184&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the south wing was the [[Great hall|hall]] and the [[buttery (room)|buttery]], with the red and white chambers above them. Probably when Plas Mawr was first built, and certainly by 1665, the hall would have been used to meet ordinary visitors and for servants' meals, rather than forming the main room of the house; the wooden benches and table on display are original to the property.&lt;ref name="Turner 2008 17"/&gt; Traditionally, the service rooms in houses had been placed at the far end of the main hall, but Plas Mawr departed from this design.&lt;ref name=SMith1988PP232&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1988|pp=232, 245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service area, including the kitchen and [[pantry]], was instead placed in the centre of the building, between the [[parlour]] and the hall; this radical redesign was copied at nearby [[Hafod Lwyfog]].&lt;ref name=SMith1988PP232/&gt; The restored kitchen is equipped with a ''[[batterie de cuisine]]'', with a combination of original and replica equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=23, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above these rooms was the great chamber, the main room which formed the ceremonial centre of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Smith|1988|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the north wing was the [[brewhouse]] and the parlour, with two chambers above them, the latter possibly used by Dorothy Wynn as her bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private bedrooms for the family and guests were each equipped with a fireplace, an important status symbol in the period.&lt;ref name="Turner 2008 32"/&gt; The roof attics of the house contained a great deal of space for accommodating the household servants.&lt;ref name=Turner1995P184/&gt; The attic above the great chamber has a grand timber roof with [[Timber roof truss|arch-braced collar trusses]], joined using an unusual system called "double pegging", which is only used in the Conwy valley during the late 16th century.&lt;ref name=Turner2008P15&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that the great chamber's ceiling was originally supposed to be open, looking up to the timbers with the trusses visible, but a mistake in the construction of the walls meant that one side of the chamber no longer fitted smoothly with the timbers, creating an ugly appearance; a plaster ceiling was then added to hide the error.&lt;ref name=Turner2008P15/&gt;

The gardens behind the house may originally have resembled the gardens at Bodysgallen Hall, which were laid out in the Renaissance style popular across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haslam|2006|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slope of the land results in Plas Mawr's gardens forming the upper and lower terraces, and these have been replanted and restored in an attempt to show them as they might have appeared in 1665.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|pp=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[summer house|summerhouse]] is based on a version shown in a contemporary painting of [[Llanerch]]'s gardens, and the [[flowerpot]]s are modeled on those found in excavations at [[Tredegar House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plasterwork===

Seven rooms still possess elements of their original plasterwork, which the historian Peter Smith has described as "the most perfect and the most complete memorial to Elizabethan Wales", and their original wooden carved panels that line the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1988|p=245}}; {{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plasterwork includes extensive [[heraldry]], badges and symbols: in the upper north range alone, 22 different heraldic emblems are molded into the ceilings and walls.&lt;ref name=Turner2008P36&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gatehouse shows the [[Royal Arms of England|royal arms]], as do the great chamber and the parlour, probably because they were intended to host senior guests.&lt;ref name=Turner2008P36/&gt; The badges of numerous monarchs are included throughout the house, including those of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=27}}; {{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The badges of other prominent nobles, such as [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]], are also featured in the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plasterwork in the parlour displays the arms of Robert Wynn himself, and Robert Wynn's bedchamber above the brewhouse shows the combined arms of the Wynn and Griffith families, which are generally given equal prominence throughout the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Wynn's arms are most prominent in the hall and the bedchambers, where the royal arms are smaller and less prominent.&lt;ref name=Turner2008P36/&gt; In the 16th century, Wynn's heraldry would probably have been echoed in the furnishings of the house, including the fabrics, cups and silverware.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plasterwork also incorporates a number of [[Classical architecture|classical themes]], but these are not as well executed as the badges and other emblems: the historian Rick Turner describes them as "rather token additions", and Smith considers this part of the decoration to be "naive".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1988|p=229}}; Turner p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11879">'''Queer of color critique''' is a methodology that recognizes the [[Intersectionality|intersections]] of race, gender, class, sexuality, capital, and nation, and disidentifies with the universality of social categories present in canonical [[sociology]] and historical materialism. [[Roderick Ferguson]] is credited with coining this term in his 2004 book ''Aberrations in Black, ''and draws from woman of color [[feminism]], postcolonial studies, [[queer theory]] and [[African-American studies|African American studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Valles-Morales, Jesus. "On Queer of Color Criticism, Communication Studies, and Corporeality. ''Kaleidoscope: A Graduate Journal of Qualitative Communication Research ''14 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In his critique of canonical sociology, Ferguson argues that racialized heteronormativity and heteropatriarchy has played a conspicuous role in shaping sociology and social policy, and recognizes its intersection with revolutionary nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Albertine, Susan. "Aberrations in Black: Toward a Queer of Color Critique (Book Review)." ''American Literature ''77.3 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Queer of color critique operates as a method for building unlikely coalitions across different identity categories. In framing queer of color critique, Ferguson draws from [[Barbara Smith]] and the [[Combahee River Collective|Combahee River Collective's]] use of coalitional politics to address gender, race, and sexuality in context with capitalist expansion.

== Influences  ==

Queer of color critique has been taken up by multiple scholars as an attempt at a more intersectional framework on which to build and extend their work in various, sometimes intersecting academic subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, José Esteban. Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queerness and indigeneity ===

Though most references at the intersection of queerness and indigeneity fall on [[Two-Spirit]] identity and ideas surrounding it, queer of color critique extends the discussion to settler colonialism, future potentialities of Native identity and life, and general discourse about how [[Native American studies|Native Studies]] as an academic study can benefit from a sort of "queering". According to scholar [[Andrea Smith (academic)|Andrea Smith]], looking at indigeneity from this perspective questions the limitations of a "subjectless" or "postidentity" analysis in regards to the shedding of a particular ethnic identity, which in itself has roots in colonialist and nationalist ideology. On the other hand, even this sort of critique does not fully acknowledge the extent of the absence of indigeneity in the context of direct and indirect investment in settler colonialism by those of color doing the critiquing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Smith, Andrea. "Queer Theory and Native Studies: The Heteronormativity of Settler Colonialism." GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 16.1-2 (2010): 41-68. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgensen, Scott Lauria. ''Spaces between Us: Queer Settler Colonialism and Indigenous Decolonization''. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== De-colonial Studies ===
The unraveling of colonialist ideology,—the belief in a normative society—according to scholar [[Emma Perez]], is necessary to fully understand national histories and identities, specifically of queer individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez|first=Emma|date=2003|title=Queering the Borderlands: The Challenges of Excavating the Invisible and Unheard|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/50898|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=24|pages=122–131|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queer diasporic critique ===

Queer [[Diaspora|diasporic]] critique can be considered an extension of and complement to queer of color critique in that it considers ethnic and cultural identity as an underlying context when analyzing and critiquing arguments based on [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], white centered [[Queer theory|queer theories]], as well as critiquing the heteronormativity of [[area studies]]. Oftentimes, these ideas are connected to ideas of [[nationhood]] and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puar|first=Jasbir K.|date=2008-06-01|title='the Turban Is Not a Hat': Queer Diaspora and Practices of Profiling|journal=Sikh Formations|volume=4|issue=1|pages=47–91|doi=10.1080/17448720802075439|issn=1744-8727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lesk, Andrew. "Queerly Canadian: An Introductory Reader in Sexuality Studies Ed. by Maureen FitzGerald and Scott Rayter (review)." ''University of Toronto Quarterly''. University of Toronto Press, 28 Oct. 2015. Web. 29 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of scholar [[Gayatri Gopinath]], "While both queer of color and queer diasporic analysis are part of a collective endeavor to reshape queer studies through a thorough engagement with questions of race, nationalism, and transnationalism, it may also be useful to explore some of the points at which the interventions and emphases of each project both intersect and diverge." In this respect, critique emphasizing diaspora tends to focus more on a "global restructuring of capital and its attendant gender and sexual hierarchies" and the creation of "home" in regards to diaspora and [[transnationalism]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gopinath, Gayatri. "Bollywood Spectacles: Queer Diasporic Critique in the Aftermath of 9/11." Social Text 23.3-4 84-85 (2005): 157-69. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Queer Muslims ====

An example of queer of color critique in practice can be seen in the analysis of queer Muslims in Europe done by scholar [[Fatima El-Tayeb]], which touches on the larger themes explored in [[queer theory]]. Among these is the idea of "[[Coming out|coming-out]]" as a person of diaspora, which challenges the currently held notion of its role in the creation of a "normative, healthy and desirable LGBT identity". Another describes how the idea of [[Islamophobia]] permeates into the [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] oppressions faced by queer Muslims in the west. The ideas of migration and "home" are also critiqued in that the ethnic migrant laborer lives amongst an "increasingly segregated, criminalized and policed multi-ethnic population of color". These queer diasporic and queer of color critiques therefore act as a lens through which to view homonormativity and the various facets through which is functions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;El-Tayeb, F. "'Gays Who Cannot Properly Be Gay': Queer Muslims in the Neoliberal European City." European Journal of Women's Studies 19.1 (2012): 79-95. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Puar, Jasbir K. Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer times. Durham, NC: Duke UP, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a type of community manifestation of this type of critique, the queer of color activist group [[Strange Fruit: A Dutch Queer Collective]] takes an intersectional, colored approach to queer activism. This helps undermine binaries such as the "Muslim/European dichotomy to the normative coming out narrative", which, according to [[Fatima El-Tayeb|El-Tayeb]], perpetuate homonormativity and racism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Scholarship ===
Some notable scholars who have incorporated queer of color critique into their work are [[Roderick Ferguson]], Jesus Values-Morales, [[Andrea Smith (academic)|Andrea Smith]], [[Gayatri Gopinath]], Fatima El-Tayeb, Martin Manalansan IV, [[Juana María Rodríguez]], [[José Esteban Muñoz]], [[Emma Perez]], Edward Brockenbrough, Salvador Vidal-Ortiz, Amy Villarejo, [[Jasbir Puar]], Scott Lauria Morgensen, [[Kevin Kumashiro|Kevin K. Kumashiro]], [[Lawrence La Fountain-Stokes]], Chandan Reddy, Jennifer C. Nash, and others.

[[File:Roman Tomb Silistra TB.JPG|thumb|Exterior view of the Roman Tomb of Silistra]]
The '''Roman Tomb of Silistra''' ({{lang-bg|Римска гробница в Силистра}}, ''Rimska grobnitsa v Silistra'') is an [[Roman funerary practices|Ancient Roman burial tomb]] in the town of [[Silistra]] in northeastern [[Bulgaria]]. Dating to the mid-4th century AD, the Roman Tomb is the best-preserved architectural monument of the [[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] city of Durostorum. The tomb is considered "one of the most investigated and most discussed monuments of the late antique art in Bulgaria" and the [[Balkans]],&lt;ref name="atanasov447"&gt;Atanasov, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; owing in large part to the quality and extent of its interior frescoes.

==History==
Though the influence of Christianity had reached Silistra by the time, the Roman Tomb is clearly an example of pagan art commissioned by a pagan owner. Thus, it is considered likely that it predates [[Theodosius I]]'s persecution of [[Roman paganism]]. Its construction also likely preceded the [[Goths|Gothic]] invasion of Durostorum of 376–378, which caused great turmoil in the city. The invasion may have caused the master's family depicted in the tomb to flee the city, explaining the lack of burials in the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Atanasov, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the tomb must be stylistically ascribed to the 4th century and specifically to Theodosius I's reign.&lt;ref name="henning"&gt;{{cite book|last=Henning|first=Joachim|title=Post-Roman Towns, Trade and Settlement in Europe and Byzantium: Byzantium, Pliska, and the Balkans|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=2007|isbn=3110183579|pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Tomb was coincidentally discovered in 1942 in the southern outskirts of Silistra, a major town in [[Southern Dobruja]] on the banks of the Lower [[Danube]]. Silistra had only recently been transferred by [[Romania]] back to Bulgaria as part of the 1940 [[Treaty of Craiova]]. Since 1984, the Roman Tomb of Silistra has been on [[UNESCO]]'s Tentative List of [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/48/|title=The late ancient tomb of Silistra|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture and frescoes==
[[File:Roman Tomb Silistra fresco servant.jpg|thumb|A fresco portraying a female servant carrying gifts to the master's family]]
The stone tomb features a single [[burial chamber]] and measures {{convert|3.30|by|2.60|m|ft|abbr=off|lk=on}}. It has a west-east orientation, with the entrance on the east wall and a semi-cylindrical brick vault.&lt;ref name="atanasov448"&gt;Atanasov, p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt; It is located amidst the ruins of a [[necropolis]] from [[Late Antiquity]] which included other similar structures.&lt;ref name="henning"/&gt;

Ceramic plates, rectangular in shape and painted using the [[fresco-secco]] technique, cover the entirety of its floor. In contrast to most other known Roman tombs from the period in the Balkans, the entire interior is covered by multi-coloured mural paintings. The northern, southern and eastern walls feature a procession of [[Slavery in ancient Rome|servants]],&lt;ref name="atanasov448"/&gt; whereas the frescoes of the western wall, directly opposite the entrances, depict the master and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Atanasov, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[frieze]] running along the walls of the tomb contains 11 panels featuring the portraits of male and female slaves bringing various gifts and garments to the masters.&lt;ref name="henning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt; The procession runs from either side of the central panel that portrays the masters, providing for a symmetrical composition. The tomb's decoration also includes hunting scenes, candlesticks, plants and animals, including [[peacock]]s and [[pigeon]]s.&lt;ref name="henning"/&gt; Overall, the decoration's remarkable level of preservation and the quality of the mural paintings makes the tomb a "unique example of art and life" in the outer regions of the Roman Empire during the turbulent 4th century.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

The Roman Tomb of Silistra is situated at the intersection of the Sedmi Septemvri and Boyka Voyvoda Streets in the town. As of 2016, it can only be toured after a prior reservation at the Regional Historical Museum of Silistra.&lt;ref name="rim-silistra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumsilistra.com/index.php/2-uncategorised/49-rimska-grobnitza|title=Римска гробница|publisher=Регионален исторически музей|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''San Francisco City Guides''' ('''SFCG''') is a non-profit organization that offers over 90&amp;nbsp;different walking tours of San Francisco presented by trained, volunteer guides. San Francisco City Guides was founded in 1978 as a program of the [[San Francisco Public Library]] (SFPL) and the [[San Francisco Parks Alliance]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Tours are offered daily, regardless of weather. Reservations are accepted  for groups of eight or more, as well as for special date or time requests.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
San Francisco City Guides was founded after frequent requests for a tour of [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]]. [[Gladys Hansen]], City Archivist, San Francisco History Room, City Hall, trained a few volunteers to give tours of City Hall and the [[San Francisco Civic Center]] to dignitaries, visitors and students. There were no schedules and tours were provided on an as-needed basis.

With ever-increasing requests, Judith Waldhorn Lynch, who was hired through [[C.E.T.A.]] was assigned to work with Gladys in the History Room in 1977. Lynch set about recruiting volunteers and supporters to formally launch the program which would later be named “City Guides.”

The first training class produced 67&amp;nbsp;volunteer guides. City Hall/Civic Center was the single tour offered.

=== 1980s ===
In 1982, Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] asked City Guides be official guides for new [[Moscone Center]]. In 1984, City Guides was appointed as San Francisco's official [[Docent]] by Mayor Feinstein.

In 1986, City Guides was asked to be official Bridge Guides for the 50th Anniversary Celebration by the Friends of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]; this tour became the eleventh regularly offered tour.

=== 1990s ===
San Francisco Public Library became City Guides' primary sponsor, while City Guides became a project of [[The Tides Center]], which now serves as fiscal agent, replacing Friends of the Library in 1996.

=== 2000s ===
In 2001, City Guides received the Ron Ross Founders Award from the [[San Francisco History Association]], in recognition of its invaluable contribution to the preservation of San Francisco history.

City Guides collaborated with [[San Francisco Beautiful and Wilderness Press]] to celebrate the 20th anniversary of a book written by a City Guide, Adan Bakalinsky, ''Stairway Walks in San Francisco'' in 2004.

In 2008, City Guides celebrated its 30th anniversary with an event held at the Main Library. In City Guides' 30th year, 30,000&amp;nbsp;walkers attended their tours.

In 2012, San Francisco City Guides started a partnership with the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfhistory.org/ |title=San Francisco Museum and Historical Society - Home |publisher=Sfhistory.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide historical, cultural and architectural walks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release|url=http://www.sfhistory.org/index.php/press/press-releases/273-release-2012-08-07|accessdate=13 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629132300/http://www.sfhistory.org/index.php/press/press-releases/273-release-2012-08-07|archivedate=29 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volunteers==
City Guide volunteers form a diverse group, united by their passion for sharing San Francisco with others. Volunteers come from all over the Bay Area and have backgrounds such as teachers, engineers, students, retired professionals, lawyers, historians, real estate agents, journalists and even professional tour guides.

'''Spanish immigration to Cuba''' began in 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus]] first landed on the island, and continues to the present day. The first sighting of a Spanish boat approaching the island was on 27 or 28 October 1492, probably at Bariay on the eastern point of the island. Columbus, on his first voyage to the Americas, sailed south from what is now [[The Bahamas]] to explore the northeast coast of Cuba and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]]. Columbus discovered the island believing it to be a peninsula of the Asian mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Early settlement ==
[[File:DiegoVelazquezCuellar.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] conquered and was the first governor of Cuba.]]
In 1511, [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] set out with three ships and an army of 300 men from Hispaniola to form the  first Spanish settlement in Cuba, with orders from Spain to conquer the island. The settlement was at Baracoa, but the new settlers were to be greeted with stiff resistance from the local Taíno population. The Taínos were initially organized by [[cacique]] (''chieftain'') [[Hatuey]], who had himself relocated from Hispaniola to escape the brutalities of Spanish rule on that island. After a prolonged [[guerrilla]] campaign, Hatuey and successive chieftains were captured and burnt alive, and within three years the Spanish had gained control of the island. In 1514, a settlement was founded in what was to become [[Havana]].

== Historical influence ==
=== Language ===
[[Spanish language|Spanish]] was brought to Cuba by the [[Spaniards]] and is the dialect of the Spanish language as it is spoken in  [[Cuba]].
Cuban Spanish is most similar to, and originates largely from the Spanish spoken in the [[Canary Islands]]. Cuba owes much of its speech patterns to the heavy [[Canarian people|Canarian]] migrations, of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

=== Religion ===
Cuba is traditionally a [[Catholic]] country. The Roman Catholic religion was brought to Cuba by Spanish colonialists at the beginning of the 16th century, is the most prevalent professed faith. After the revolution, Cuba became an officially [[Atheism|atheistic]] state and restricted religious practice. Since the Fourth Cuban Communist Party Congress in 1991, restrictions have been eased and, according to the National Catholic Observer, direct challenges by state institutions to the right to religion have all but disappeared,&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;[http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/033106/033106o.php Catholic church in Cuba strives to reestablish the faith] National Catholic Observer&lt;/ref&gt; though the church still faces restrictions of written and electronic communication, and can only accept donations from state-approved funding sources.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; The Roman Catholic Church is made up of the Cuban Catholic Bishops' Conference (COCC), led by [[Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino]], Cardinal Archbishop of Havana. 

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] estimates that 60 percent of the population is Catholic. But the Catholic Church is subject to government restrictions, and it is not allowed to have its own schools or media.&lt;ref&gt;"... the church would like the right to bring in more missionaries and perform works of charity without first seeking government approval. It would also like to open its own schools and have a voice in the state-controlled media." [http://worldblog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/12/02/1695483.aspx Cuba softens stance toward Catholic Church - World Blog - msnbc.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to statistics, Catholics represent 71.79% of [[Havana]]'s population, 69.24% [[Matanzas]], 63.15% [[Camagüey]] and [[Santiago de Cuba]] having the lowest percentage of Catholics at 23.81%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/country/sccu3.html Catholic Population]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palacio del Centro Asturiano.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The [[Palacio del Centro Asturiano]] building was created as place of social reunion for the [[Asturian people|Asturian]] immigrants]]
===Bullfighting===
[[Bullfighting]] as well as traditional cultural fiesta's, also saw a presence in [[Cuba]] during its colonial period uninterrupted from 1538 to 1899. 
In Havana there were many [[plaza de toros]] with many of the torero's coming from [[Cadiz]], [[Spain]].
In the first half of the 19th century, bullfights were held in [[Sancti Spíritus]] in 1850 and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fenix.co.cu/ss/ss1207935.htm ¿Corridas de toros en Cuba?] Bullfights in Cuba?&lt;/ref&gt; 
One of the most prominent bullfighters at the time was "Cheche de la Habana" [[José Marrero Báez]] (1870–1909) born in [[Havana, Cuba]] and died performing in [[Ciudad Jiménez]], [[Mexico]]. In the 19th century, Havana and [[Montevideo]] were major bullfighting cities which eventually lost the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portaltaurino.com/cuba/index.htm TOROS EN CUBA] (In Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration waves==
The European heritage of Cubans comes primarily from one source: the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] (including [[Canarian people|Canarians]], [[Asturian people|Asturians]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Galician people|Galicians]] and [[Castilian people|Castilian]]s).

'''Speed reading''' is any of several techniques used to improve one's ability to read quickly. Speed reading methods include [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]] and minimizing [[subvocalization]]. The many available speed reading training programs include books, videos, software, and seminars. There is scientific controversy surrounding the domain of speed reading.

== History ==
Psychologists and educational specialists working on [[visual acuity]] used a [[tachistoscope]] to conclude,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Journal of Behavioral Optometry |year=2003 |volume=14 |issue=2 |page=40 |title= The Tachistoscope Its History &amp; Uses |author=Edward C. Godnig, O.D. |url=http://www.oepf.org/sites/default/files/journals/jbo-volume-14-issue-2/14-2%20Godnig.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that with training, an average person could identify minute images flashed on the screen for only one five-hundredth of a second (2 [[millisecond|ms]]). Though the images used were of airplanes, the results had implications for reading.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speed reading fact or fiction|url=http://brainathlete.com/speed-reading-fact-fiction/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the late 1950s that a portable, reliable, and convenient device would be developed as a tool for increasing reading speed. [[Evelyn Wood (teacher)|Evelyn Wood]], a researcher and schoolteacher, was committed to understanding why some people were naturally faster at reading and tried to force herself to read very quickly. In 1958, while brushing off the pages of a book she had thrown down in despair, she discovered that the sweeping motion of her hand across the page caught the attention of her eyes, and helped them move more smoothly across the page. She then used the hand as a pacer. Wood first taught the method at the [[University of Utah]], before launching it to the public as Evelyn Wood's Reading Dynamics in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0wn1I3Q9SQC&amp;pg=PA40|title=The Evelyn Wood Seven-Day Speed Reading and Learning Program|first=Stanley D|last=Frank|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|page=40|isbn=9781566194020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

===Skimming and scanning===
'''Skimming''' is a process of speed reading that involves visually searching the sentences of a page for clues to the main idea or when reading an essay, it can mean reading the beginning and ending for summary information, then optionally the [[Topic sentence|first sentence of each paragraph]] to quickly determine whether to seek still more detail, as determined by the [[SQ3R#Process|questions]] or purpose of the reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2017-08-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some people, this comes naturally, but is usually acquired by practice. Skimming is usually seen more in adults than in children. It is 
conducted at a higher rate (700 words per minute and above) than normal [[reading (activity)|reading]] for comprehension (around 200–230 wpm), and results in lower comprehension rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Just|first1=Marcel Adam|title=Speedreading|url=https://works.bepress.com/marcel_just_cmu/84/|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially with information-rich reading material. '''Scanning''' is the process where one actively looks for information using a [[mind-map]] (organizing information in a visually hierarchical manner that showcases the interrelatedness of the information for better retrievability) formed from skimming. These techniques are used by meta-guiding your eyes. Scanning includes the main point as well as headings and important information.

=== Meta guiding ===
'''Meta guiding''' is the visual guiding of the eye using a finger or pointer, such as a pen, in order for the eye to move faster along the length of a passage of text. It involves drawing invisible shapes on a page of text in order to broaden the visual span for speed reading. For example, an audience of customers at a speed reading seminar will be instructed to use a finger or pen to make these shapes on a page and told that this will speed up their [[visual cortex]], increase their visual span to take in the whole line, and even imprint the information into their subconscious for later retrieval. It has also been claimed to reduce [[subvocalization]] (saying words in your head rather than grasping the idea), thereby speeding up reading. Because this encourages the eye to skim over the text, it can reduce comprehension and memory, and lead to missing important details of the text. An emphasis on [[Saccade|viewing]] each word, albeit briefly without regression (Regression is an unconscious process where the eyes go forward two or three “stops” and then go back.) is required for this method to be effective. E.g. S movement and Z movement{{clarify|date=February 2016}}

Speed reading is a skill honed through practice. Reading a text involves comprehension of the material. In speed reading practice this is done through multiple reading processes: preview, overview, read, review and recite; and by read and recall (recording through writing a short summary or a mental outline) exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Method to Improve Reading Speed | url=https://www.getacademichelp.com/blog/method-to-improve-reading-speed }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important method for better comprehension is the [[SQ3R]] process. These processes help an individual to retain most of the presented ideas from a reading material. A better focus in comprehension is attained through a better reading process with good understanding of the topic.{{clarify|date=February 2016}}

== Types of reading ==
Types of reading greatly affect the speed of reading. Each of us is wired differently from environmental influences. Many have learned to read word by word from grade school, and have never been taught or informed the need to improve upon that method. When reading word by word, our eyes often skip back to a previous word or line; we might also fixate on a single word even after it has been read. These mechanical issues slow us down while reading and comprehending.

There are three types of reading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Professional skills|url=http://www.materials.ac.uk/guides/developing.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Mental reading ([[Subvocalization]]): sounding out each word internally, as reading to yourself. This is the slowest form of reading. Many intelligent people read with subvocalization and 250 wpm.
# Auditory reading: hearing out the read words. This is a faster process.
# Visual reading: understanding the meaning of the word, rather than sounding or hearing. This is the fastest process.

Mental readers generally read at approximately 250 words per minute. Auditory readers read at approximately 450 words per minute. Visual readers read at approximately 700 words per minute. Proficient readers are able to read 280 - 310 wpm without compromising comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Speed Reading|url = https://wellness.uchicago.edu/page/speed-reading|website = The University of Chicago Student Health and Counseling Services|access-date = December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on comprehension ==
Skimming alone may not be ideal when complete [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]] of the text is the main objective. Skimming is mainly used when researching and getting an overall idea of the text. Nonetheless, when time is limited, skimming or skipping over text can aid comprehension when layered reading is employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Doug Lemov|author2=Colleen Driggs|author3=Erica Woolway|title=Reading Reconsidered: A Practical Guide to Rigorous Literacy Instruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u5YvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=29 February 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-10424-7|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duggan &amp; Payne (2009) compared skimming with reading normally, given only enough time to read normally through half of a text. They found that the main points of the full text were better understood after skimming (which could view the full text) than after normal reading (which only read half the text). There was no difference between the groups in their understanding of less important information from the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Duggan | first1 = GB. | last2 = Payne | first2 = SJ. | title = Text skimming: the process and effectiveness of foraging through text under time pressure | journal = J Exp Psychol Appl | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 228–42 |date=Sep 2009 | doi = 10.1037/a0016995 | pmid = 19751073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, other findings suggest that speed reading courses which teach techniques that largely constitute skimming of written text result in a lower comprehension rate (below 50% comprehension on standardized comprehension tests) (Carver 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carver | first1 = R.P. | title = Reading rate: Theory, research and practical implications. | journal = Journal of Reading | volume = 36 | pages = 84–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vanderlinde |first1=William |title=Speed Reading: Fact or Fiction? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehension is considered to be better if the text is skimmed and main key words are underlined before regular reading due to the function of RAS (Reticular Activating System) in the brain. This is the part of the brain that dislikes incomplete information. It aids the reader to find the information close to a topic. For the RAS is activated by the questions and prioritized information, this makes the reader more focused while reading with a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Erlauer|title=The Brain-compatible Classroom: Using what We Know about Learning to Improve Teaching|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypVuBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|year=2003|publisher=ASCD|isbn=978-0-87120-748-7|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arvin Vohra]], in "Introduction to Speed Reading and Rapid Analytical Reading" claims that material structure (close and open forms) based and grammar based reading can lead to a simultaneous increase in speed and comprehension. Just as moving from letter by letter reading in early childhood to word by word reading in later childhood increases speed and comprehension, he argues that reading clause by clause or phrase by phrase can cause a similar increase in speed and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| last1 = Vohra | first1 = Arvin | title = Introduction to Speed Reading and Rapid Analytical Reading | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software ==
[[File:Eye-exercise-for-speed-reading thumb.gif|thumb|Eye exercise for speed reading]]

Computer programs are available to help instruct speed reading students. Some programs present the data as a serial stream, since the brain handles text more efficiently by breaking it into such a stream before [[parsing]] and interpreting it. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The 2000 National Reading Panel (NRP) report (p.&amp;nbsp;3-1) seems to support such a mechanism.

To increase speed, some older programs required readers to view the center of the screen while the lines of text around it grew longer. They also presented several objects (instead of text) moving line by line or bouncing around the screen; users had to follow the object(s) with only their eyes. A number of researchers criticize using objects instead of words as an effective training method, claiming that the only way to read faster is to read actual text. Many of the newer speed reading programs use built-in text, and they primarily guide users through the lines of an on-screen book at defined speeds. Often the text is highlighted to indicate where users should focus their eyes; they are not expected to read by pronouncing the words, but instead to read by viewing the words as complete images. The exercises are also intended to train readers to eliminate [[subvocalization]], though it has not been proven that this will increase reading speed.

== Controversies in speed reading ==
Common controversies in speed reading are between its intent and nature with traditional concepts like comprehension vs speed; reading vs skimming; popular psychology vs evidence-based psychology. Much of the controversy is raised over these points. This is mainly because a reading comprehension level of 50% is deemed unusable by some educationalists (Carver 1992). Speed reading advocates claim that it is a great success and even state that it is a demonstration of good comprehension for many purposes ([[Tony Buzan|Buzan]] 2000). The trade-off between "speed" and comprehension must be analyzed with respect to the type of reading that is being done, the risks associated with mis-understanding due to low comprehension, and the benefits associated with getting through the material quickly and gaining information at the actual rate is to be obtained. [[Mark Seidenberg]] considers claims like 25,000 words per minute "cannot be true given basic facts about eyes and texts" and comments that "people are as likely to read thousands of words per minute as they are to run faster than the speed of light".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Seidenberg|title=Language at the Speed of Sight: How We Read, Why So Many Can't, and What Can Be Done About It|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTBnAgAAQBAJ|date=3 January 2017|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-08065-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amy Carter and Jimmy Carter participate in a speed reading course at the White House. - NARA - 173797.jpg|[[Jimmy Carter]] and his daughter [[Amy Carter|Amy]] participate in a speed reading course.|thumb|right]]
In a 2016 article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rayner|first=Keith|last2=Schotter|first2=Elizabeth R.|last3=Masson|first3=Michael E. J.|last4=Potter|first4=Mary C.|last5=Treiman|first5=Rebecca|date=2016-01-14|title=So Much to Read, So Little Time|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1529100615623267|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=4–34|doi=10.1177/1529100615623267|issn=1529-1006}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the journal of 'Psychological Science in the Public Interest', the authors conclude there is no 'magic bullet' for reading more quickly while maintaining comprehension other than to practice reading and to become a more skilled language user (e.g. through increased vocabulary). The authors proceed with debunking common speed reading techniques such as eliminating sub-vocalization, reading more than one word at a time a.k.a. grouping, using [[Rapid serial visual presentation|RSVP]] (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation), increasing peripheral vision, alternating colors for each line of text.

U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] was a proponent of speed reading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=John F. Kennedy on Leadership | url=http://www.presidentialexpert.com/leadership_john_f_kennedy.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraged his staff to take lessons. U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]], and his wife [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn]], were both avid readers and enrolled in a speed-reading course at the White House,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=American Experience  | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/gallery/gal_carter_09.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with several staff members. A critical discussion about speed reading stories appeared in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. Among others, the article raises doubts about the origin of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s allegedly amazing reading speed.

Ronald Carver, a professor of education research and psychology, claims that the fastest college graduate readers can only read about 600 words per minute, at most twice as fast as their slowest counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/briefing/articles/2000/02/the_1000word_dash.html | title=The 1,000-Word Dash | first = Timothy | last = Noah | authorlink = Timothy Noah | date = Feb 18, 2000 | work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have suggested that speed reading is actually skimming, not reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Skeptic's Dictionary | url=http://skepdic.com/speedreading.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Championship Speed Reading Competition stresses reading comprehension as critical. The top contestants typically read around 1,000 to 2,000 words per minute with approximately 50% comprehension or above. The six time world champion Anne Jones is recorded for 4200wpm with previous exposure to the material and 67% comprehension. The recorded number of words the eye can see in single fixation is three words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vkBywAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversy is about "Speed Reading World Record" claims. For example, Howard Stephen Berg from the United States claims to be the Guinness Fastest Reader World Record holder with his reading speed of 25,000 words per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Howard Berg "World's Fastest Reader" on Good Day Tampa Bay Fox 13  | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilvoigdxhzo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another such claim comes from Ms. Maria Teresa Calderon from the Philippines. She claims that she earned  the Guinness World Record as the World's Fastest Reader with her 80,000 words per minute reading speed and 100% comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=World's fastest reader (80,000 words per minute)| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6ZLsyXYJWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether these announcements were made as Guinness Speed Reading World Records or not, critics point out that con-artists beat these speed reading world records by reading a pre-read or pre-memorized text just by flipping the pages as fast as possible without reading it. The troubling problem is under what criteria these world records were recorded and set. Moreover, the Guinness Speed Reading World Record Standards are not known and they have terminated adding speed readers to its honor list. In 2015, ''Memoriad'', the World Mental Sports Federation, set the rules for "Speed Reading World Record Standards" in order to prevent such unclear claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SPEED READING WORLD RECORD STANDARDS - Memoriad| url=http://www.memoriad.com/index.asp?s=kategoriler&amp;b=kategori-detay&amp;kategoriid=22dcbcd854eaa633da9a3df588bdb010&amp;lang=EN#a39a8d291a0e2db349fe3fc32aa201b6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Speed Reading World Record Standards| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8tHsrVvFBc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Techne'''" is a term, etymologically derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word [[Wikt:τέχνη|τέχνη]] ({{IPA-el|tékʰnɛː|anc}}, {{IPA-el|ˈtexni|mod|Ell-Techni.ogg}}), that is often translated as "craftsmanship", "craft", or "art".

Techne is a term in philosophy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/Subjects_and_titles__t134.html oxfordreference.com website] Retrieved 2011-12-03 {{ISBN|0198661320}} (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; which resembles ''[[Episteme|epistēmē]]'' in the implication of knowledge of principles, although techne differs in that its intent is making or doing as opposed to disinterested understanding. [[Martin Heidegger]] maintains that the concept for the ancients goes together with ''episteme'', particularly citing [[Plato]] who used the two terms interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gods and Technology: A Reading of Heidegger|last=Rojcewicz|first=Richard|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2006|isbn=9780791466414|location=New York|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that techne and episteme simply mean knowing and "both words are names for knowledge in the widest sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bioethics and Biolaw through Literature|last=Carpi|first=Daniela|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2011|isbn=9783110252842|location=Boston|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an activity, techne is concrete, variable, and context-dependent. As one observer has argued, techne "was not concerned with the necessity and eternal ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truths of the [[cosmos]], nor with the ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' contingencies and exigencies of [[ethics]] and [[politics]]. [...] Moreover, this was a kind of knowledge associated with people who were bound to necessity. That is, techne was chiefly operative in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], in farming and slavery, and not in the free realm of the Greek polis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/pew.0.0045 |jstor=40213567 |last=Young |first=Damon A. |year=2009 |title=Bowing to Your Enemies: Courtesy, ''Budō'', and Japan |journal=Philosophy East &amp; West |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=188–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] saw it as representative of the imperfection of human imitation of nature. For the [[ancient Greeks]], it signified all the [[mechanic arts]], including medicine and music. The English [[aphorism]], "gentlemen don't work with their hands", is said to have originated in ancient Greece in relation to their [[cynical]] view on the arts. Due to this view, it was only fitted for the lower class while the upper class practiced the [[liberal arts]] of 'free' men (Dorter 1973).

Socrates also compliments techne only when it was used in the context of ''epistēmē''. ''Epistēmē'' sometimes means knowing how to do something in a craft-like way. The craft-like knowledge is called a ''technê''. It is most useful when the knowledge is practically applied, rather than theoretically or aesthetically applied. For the ancient Greeks, when techne appears as art, it is most often viewed negatively, whereas when used as a [[craft]] it is viewed positively because a craft is the practical application of an art, rather than art as an end in itself. In ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', written by [[Plato]], the knowledge of [[Theory of Forms|forms]] "is the indispensable basis for the philosophers' craft of ruling in the city" (Stanford 2003). Techne is often used in philosophical discourse to distinguish from art (or ''[[poiesis]]''). {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Usage in art history===
"In fact, techne and ars referred less to a class of objects than to the human ability to make and perform ... the issue is not about the presence or absence of a word but about the interpretation of a body of evidence, and I believe there is massive evidence that the ancient Greeks and Romans had no category of fine art." (Shiner 2001 pp.&amp;nbsp;19–20)

In his work [[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History|''The Invention of Art'']], Larry Shiner argues that techne cannot be simply translated to art nor either simply to craft. This being due to art and craft being socially constructed at a certain period in history.

===Techne as an art in rhetoric===
Techne is often used as a term to further define the process of rhetoric as an art of persuasion.  In his writing Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric, rhetoric scholar Dr. [[John Poulakos]] explains how the [[Sophist]]s believed rhetoric to be an art that aimed for terpis, or aesthetic pleasure, while maintaining a medium of [[logos]]. For centuries, debate between sophists and followers of [[Plato]] has ensued over whether rhetoric can be considered a form of art based on the different definitions of techne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poulakos |first=John |authorlink= |author2= |year=1983 |month= |title=Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric |journal=Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=36–37 |jstor=40237348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasting from others, [[Isocrates]] saw rhetoric as an art—yet in the form of a set of rules, or a handbook.  Some examples of handbooks are the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric of Aristotle]]'', the ''[[Rhetoric to Alexander|Rhetorica ad Alexandrum]]'', and the ''[[De Inventione|De Inventione of Cicero]]'', all composed of rules to write effective speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papillion |first=Terry |year=1995 |title=Isocrates' ''techne'' and Rhetorical Pedagogy |journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly |volume=25 |pages=149–163 |jstor=3886281 |doi=10.1080/02773949509391038}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it can be seen in David Roochnik's book of Art and Wisdom: Plato's Understanding of Techne that Plato viewed techne as "a stable body of reliable knowledge able to tell us, in fixed terms readily teachable to others, how we ought to live." He believed that moral knowledge is equivalent to a techne and that the meaning of the term techne must be fully grasped to understand the nature of moral knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roochnik |first=David |authorlink= |title=Of Art and Wisdom: Plato's Understanding of Techne |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |series= |volume= |edition= |year=1996 |location=University Park, PA |pages=xi–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', Plato wrote that rhetoric is not techne but a habit of a bold and ready wit. Plato continued saying rhetoric is not an art but an experience because it fails to explain the nature of its own application. He compared it to cookery and medicine saying cookery pretends to know what is best for the body because it is pleasurable while medicine knows what is for the best of the health of the human body. Medicine is techne for it seeks what is best for the health of a person unlike cookery which is only for pleasure and fools a person into believing it is better for their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first=Plato |authorlink= |author2= |year=1952 |month= |title=Gorgias |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages=17–19 |id= |url=https://courseweb.pitt.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-16260281-dt-content-rid-10200501_2/courses/2144_UPITT_COMMRC_0310_SEC1100/Platos%20Gorgias.pdf |accessdate= |quote= }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Parry writes Aristotle believed techne aims for good and forms an end, which could be the activity itself or a product formed from the activity. Aristotle used health as an example of an end that is produced from the techne of medicine. To make a distinction between techne and arete he said the value of techne is the end product while arete values choosing the action that promotes the best moral good.

===Communication as techne===
Techne is also a part of communication, and affects how human cultures interact. When people speak to one another, they apply their knowledge of social interactions, verbal and nonverbal cues, and their shared language to the skill of speaking. It is both personal and social, everybody has their own personal techne around their speech based on learned experiences and personal tics, and very social in that communities all communicate amongst each other on the interpersonal and large scale. 

In relation to communication, techne is based less on what a person says or thinks, but on what they do. The mechanical action of speaking is mostly unconscious, and most of the work takes place in the centers of the brain similar to how a pianist knows where his fingers should go even without looking (Shepard). As Jonathan Sterne puts it, "Communication requires both language and technology – and both are forms of techne." (Shepard) In relation to technology, the use of a cell phone or any other communicative device requires both an understanding of how the phone works and how social interactions are supposed to be handled on the telephone, but also requires that a person actively does it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Shepard|first= Gregory J. |author2= Jeffrey St. John |author3= Theodore G. Striphas |year=2006 |chapter=Communication as Techne |title= Communication as... Perspectives on Theory |pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Techne'' and ''technik'' ===
''Techne'' can also be compared or distinguished from the German conceptualization of the term ''technik'', which referred both to the material composition of industry as well as to the rules, procedures, and skills used to achieve a particular end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and Isolation|last=Lawson|first=Clive|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781107180833|location=Cambridge|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writing of [[Thorstein Veblen]] eventually linked this concept with technology particularly in his evaluation of the works of [[Gustav von Schmoller|Gustav Schmoller]] and [[Werner Sombart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schatzberg|first=Eric|date=2006-08-07|title=Technik Comes to America: Changing Meanings of Technology before 1930|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/201479|journal=Technology and Culture|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=486–512|doi=10.1353/tech.2006.0201|issn=1097-3729}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of ''techne'' (art) and ''technik'' (technology) is viewed to share a commonality - that both are ways in which beings as a whole may be brought to light.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger and the Work of Art History|last=Vinegar|first=Aron|last2=Boetzkes|first2=Amanda|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2014|isbn=9781409456131|location=Surrey|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while ''techne'' maintains a relation to nature's capacity for self-disclosure, ''technik'' severs it through a regulatory attack that provokes nature to give up its latent power.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Heidegger, ''technik'' - by contrast to ''techne'' -  refuses "to let earth be an earth."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''The Kid Stays in the Picture''''' is a 1994 autobiography by film producer [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]].  A [[film adaptation]] of the book was released in 2002.

The title comes from a line attributed to studio head [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], who was defending Evans after some of the actors involved in the film ''[[The Sun Also Rises (1957 film)|The Sun Also Rises]]'' (1957) had recommended he be removed from the cast.

The film adaptation was directed by [[Nanette Burstein]] and [[Brett Morgen]] and released by [[USA Films]]. It was screened out of competition at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3110701/year/2002.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Kid Stays in the Picture |accessdate=2009-11-04 |work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Book===
The book chronicles Evans' rise from childhood to radio star to film star to production chief of [[Paramount Pictures]] to independent producer, his marriage to [[Ali MacGraw]], his downfall including his 1980 cocaine bust and implication in the murder of [[Roy Radin]], aka "The Cotton Club Murder", his banishment from Paramount Pictures, and his return to the studio in the early 1990s.

A revised edition of the book, published in 1995, adds several chapters of new material, including material on his projects after his return to Paramount Pictures.

===Film===
The film version, released in 2002, utilizes Evans' narration interspersed mostly with photographs from Evans' life as well as brief film footage from films such as ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'', ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'', ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', and ''[[The Godfather]]'', along with interviews to tell the story from his discovery by [[Norma Shearer]] for ''[[Man of a Thousand Faces (film)|Man of a Thousand Faces]]'' (1957) to his return to Paramount Pictures.

According to the commentary by directors Burstein and Morgen on the DVD, many elements from the book, such as Evans' childhood and his other marriages (the film focuses only on his marriage to Ali MacGraw), were dropped because they felt it did not move the story along.

==Critical response==
The film received mostly positive reviews. As of April 8, 2012, it had a 92% "Certified Fresh" rating on the movie review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and a score of 7.4 out of 10 on [[IMDb]], based on 4,077 reviews.

==Stage production==
An adaptation of the book—along with material from a further, unpublished volume of Evans' memoirs—for the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage was announced in 2010, to be written by [[Jon Robin Baitz]] and directed by [[Richard Eyre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Hollywood Player Inspires a Broadway Play |author=Michael Cieply |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/theater/11evans.html?_r=1&amp;hpw |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=February 10, 2010 |accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the production was canceled in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/156769-PLAYBILL-ON-OPENING-NIGHT-Private-Lives-Keeping-Up-with-the-Chases |title=Playbill on Opening Night: ''Private Lives'' – Keeping Up with the Chases |author=Harry Haun |date=November 18, 2011 |work=Playbill.com |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419165412/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/156769-PLAYBILL-ON-OPENING-NIGHT-Private-Lives-Keeping-Up-with-the-Chases |archivedate=April 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another stage adaptation of the book was first performed at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in [[London]] in 2017. It was adapted by the [[Complicite]] theatre company and directed by [[Simon McBurney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/kid-stays-picture |title=the kid stays in the picture - Royal Court |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast included [[Danny Huston]], son of [[John Huston]], who worked with Evans on ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.

'''''The Triumph of Peace''''' was a [[Literature in English#Caroline and Cromwellian literature|Caroline]] era [[masque]], "invented and written" by [[James Shirley]], performed on 3 February [[1634 in literature|1634]] and published the same year. The production was designed by [[Inigo Jones]].

==Inspiration==
The masque was lavishly sponsored by the four [[Inns of Court]], through a political and social motive. In [[1632 in literature|1632]] the Puritan controversialist [[William Prynne]] (himself an Inns of Court man) had dedicated his anti-theatre diatribe ''[[Histriomastix]]'' to the Inns; since ''Histriomastix'' was perceived as insulting to Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], the masque was the Inns' signal of their total rejection of any connection with Prynne's book or his views.

Shirley was chosen to write the masque because he was a member of [[Gray's Inn]]. He was not a law student or a lawyer; rather, he was a gentleman boarder, an arrangement preferred by some literary figures of the time. ([[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] was another gentleman boarder). Shirley produced an acceptable text &amp;mdash; though he was bold enough to offer some tactfully-phrased advice to his king.

==Publication==
The masque was entered into the [[Stationers' Register]] on 24 January 1634 and was licensed for performance by Sir [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Henry Herbert]], the [[Master of the Revels]], on the date it was acted, 3 February 1634. (Some sources give the date for the masque as 1633, failing to compensate for the difference in [[Old Style and New Style dates]].)

The work was published in the same year, in a [[book size|quarto]] printed by John Norton for the bookseller [[Andrew Crooke and William Cooke|William Cooke]]. The quarto exists in three impressions, with slight differences between the first and second and greater changes in the third. ([[Walter Wilson Greg|W. W. Greg]] wrote an article titled "The Triumph of Peace: A Bibliographer's Nightmare.")&lt;ref&gt;''The Library,'' 5, series 1 (1946), pp. 113-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscript==
A manuscript relating to the masque also exists, now in the collection of the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] (it is item #25 in Folger MS. Z.e.1). The MS. provides a cast list that names 184 of the participants in the procession (among a total of 882), along with details on the distribution of equipment and props.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Elliott, Jr., "The Folger Manuscript of the ''Triumph of Peace'' Precession," in Beal and Griffiths, pp. 193-215.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The music for the masque was composed by [[William Lawes]], Simon Ives, and [[Bulstrode Whitelocke]].
Musical aspects of the performance were managed for the Inns of Court by Whitelocke, the jurist and Parliamentarian, who was also an accomplished musician. Documents pertaining to the masque were preserved among Whitelocke's unpublished papers. As a result, more is known about the production of ''The Triumph of Peace'' than perhaps any other masque of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] or [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] eras &amp;mdash; including "a cast list, the names and voice parts of all the singers, the names and instruments of all the musicians, diagrams with musicians' names for soloists and chorus positions during the mask, a cue sheet for the serious part of the mask, names of musicians who played at the [[Blackfriars Theatre|Blackfriars]] and [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]]," and other data.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 157-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

(Murray Lefkowitz, the musicologist who discovered the masque papers at [[Longleat]], has written extensively on the subject. Musicologist Andrew Sabol also published some of the relevant documents.)

==The performance==
The performance was given at [[Whitehall Palace]] by members of the Inns of Court and was seen by the King, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and the Queen. The masquers started out at [[Ely Place|Ely House]], then the London residence of the [[Bishops of Ely]], and moved in procession or "cavalcade" down Chancery Lane and [[Strand, London|the Strand]] to Whitehall. This parade was led by the King's Marshall and his men bearing torches, who were followed by 100 members of the Inns of Court, 25 from each of the four Inns, dressed in gold and silver lace. Then came two music chariots; the first held eight lutenists dressed as priests and [[Sibyl|Sybils]], while the second carried singers "who struck picturesque poses in costumes representing the celestial bodies in harmonious motion."&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Then came the actors of the masque; the boys in one anti-masque were costumed as birds. The principal masquers came last, in four chariots, each drawn by four horses; the horses were decked in silver and crimson cloths and white and red feathers, and each chariot bore two "flaming huge flambeaux" on its sides. (Each of the Inns of Court furnished twenty dozen torches and 15 flambeaux for the procession.) Charles and Henrietta Maria, watching this from Whitehall, were so impressed that they had the parade turn around and pass them again.&lt;ref&gt;Leapman, pp. 300-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of the masque was relatively simple and straightforward: the spirits of Peace, Law, and Justice descend to honor the English monarchs. Yet the expression is complex, with seven changes of scene; at one point the moon sets in an open landscape and "Amphiluche," the harbinger of morning, rises in turn. There are no fewer than eight anti-masques.

The masque featured the personifications standard to the form, including Opinion, Confidence, Fancy, Jollity, Novelty, and others; also, generic tradesmen, a Tailor, Carpenter, Painter, Feathermaker's Wife, Embroiderer's Wife, etc. The costumes were rich and fantastic: "Fancy in a suit of several-colored feathers, hooded, a pair of bat's wings on his shoulders...Jollity in a flame-colored suit, but tricked like a [[morris dance]]r, with scarfs and napkins, his hat fashioned like a cone...." Some of the costumes were "wrought as thick with silver spangles as they could be placed." At one point in the masque, a windmill, a knight and his squire entered &amp;mdash; an obvious allusion to ''[[Don Quixote]]'' &amp;mdash; and engaged in a mock combat. Shirley deliberately included elements in the masque, including "two wanton gamesters," that were precisely the type of elements criticized by Prynne in ''Histriomastix''.&lt;ref&gt;Raffield, pp. 217-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen Henrietta liked the masque so much that she arranged for a repeat performance at [[Merchant Taylors' Hall, London|Merchant Taylors' Hall]] on 13 February. The cost for the show was extraordinary: £1000 for the music; a hundred costumes at £100 each. The total cost of the extravaganza was, according to Whitelocke, £21,000, all paid by the Inns of Court (at a time when a squire might earn £100 in a year).&lt;ref&gt;Wedgwood, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; By some accounts (including that of Shirley himself), ''The Triumph of Peace'' was the most spectacular masque of the period.

A '''triskelion''' or '''triskele''' is a [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] consisting of a '''triple spiral''' exhibiting   [[rotational symmetry]].
The spiral design can be based on interlocking [[Archimedean spiral]]s,  or represent three bent human legs.

Both terms are from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{Lang|el|"τρισκέλιον"}} (''triskelion'') or {{lang|grc|"τρισκελής"}} (''triskeles''), "three-legged",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtriskelh%2Fs τρισκελής],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on [[Perseus Digital Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; from prefix "τρι-" (''tri-''), "three times"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dtri- τρι-], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; + "σκέλος" (''skelos''), "leg".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dske%2Flos σκέλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

A triskelion is a traditional symbol of [[Sicily]], where it is called ''trinacria'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Angelo &amp; Mario Grifasi |url=http://www.grifasi-sicilia.com/trinacria.htm |title=Sicilia: Il Perchè del nome Trinacria |publisher=Grifasi-sicilia.com |date=1999-01-28 |accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Isle of Man]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/isleofman/facts.xml#flag |title=Isle of Man Government |accessdate=2012-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510212828/http://www.gov.im/isleofman/facts.xml#flag |archivedate=2007-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is known in Manx as ''Tree Cassyn Vannin'', and [[Brittany]] where it is known as ''Triskèle''. [[Ingushetia]] also has a (stylised) triskelion in its flag.

The triskelion symbol appears in many early cultures, the first in [[Malta]] (4400–3600 BCE) and in the astronomical calendar at the famous megalithic tomb of [[Newgrange]] in Ireland built around 3200 BCE,&lt;ref name="knowth.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowth.com/newgrange.htm |title=Newgrange Ireland - Megalithic Passage Tomb - World Heritage Site |publisher=Knowth.com |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] vessels, on coinage in [[Lycia]], and on [[stater]]s of [[Pamphylia]] (at [[Aspendos]], 370–333 BCE) and [[Pisidia]]. It appears as a [[heraldic]] emblem on warriors' shields depicted on Greek pottery.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the trislele on [[Achilles]]' round shield on an Attic late 6th century BCE ''[[hydria]]'' at the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], illustrated in John Boardman, Jasper Griffin and Oswyn Murray, ''Greece and the Hellenistic World'' (Oxford History of the Classical World) vol. I (1988), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The triskelion is an ancient symbol of [[Sicily]], with the head of the [[Gorgon]], with snakes as hair, from which radiate three legs bent at the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weddinginsicily.co.uk/wedding_sicily_trinacria.htm|title=Weddings in Sicily Taormina|website=www.weddinginsicily.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of [[Magna Graecia]], the colonial extension of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] beyond the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].&lt;ref name="naples"&gt;Matthews, Jeff (2005) [http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/symbols.htm Symbols of Naples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030202145/http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/symbols.htm |date=2009-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] attributes the origin of the triskelion of Sicily to the [[triangle|triangular]] form of the island, the ancient ''[[Kingdom of Sicily|Trinacria]]'' (from the Greek ''tri-'' (three) and ἄκρα ''akra'' (end, peak, citadel), which consists of three large capes equidistant{{fact|date=July 2018}} from each other, pointing in their respective directions, the names of which were [[Punta del Faro|Pelorus]], [[Capo Passero|Pachynus]], and [[Marsala|Lilybæum]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The [[Celtic art|Celtic]] symbol of [[triple spiral|three conjoined spirals]] may have had triple significance similar to the imagery that lies behind the triskelion. The triple spiral motif is a [[Neolithic]] symbol in Western Europe. Though popularly considered a "Celtic" symbol, it is in fact a pre-Celtic symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Murphy and Richard Moore, ''Island of the Setting Sun: In Search of Ireland's Ancient Astronomers,'' 2nd ed., Dublin: The Liffey Press, 2008, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; It is carved into the rock of a stone lozenge near the main entrance of the prehistoric [[Newgrange]] monument in [[County Meath]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Newgrange, which was built around 3200 BCE,&lt;ref name="knowth.com"/&gt; predates the Celtic arrival in Ireland, but has long since been incorporated into Celtic culture. The symbol is also found [[petroglyph|carved in rock]] in [[Castro Culture]] settlement in modern-day [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Northern Portugal]]. In Ireland before the 5th century, in [[Celtic Christianity]] the triskele took on new meaning, as a symbol of the [[Trinity]] (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and therefore also a symbol of eternity. Its popularity continues today as a decorative symbol of faith for Christians of Celtic descent around the world.

==Asian usage==
Traditional Asian versions of the triskelion include the Japanese [[Mitsudomoe]], the Tibetan Buddhist [[Gankyil]], and the Korean [[Taegeuk#Tricolored Taegeuk|Sam Taegeuk]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Modern usage==
A triskelion is featured on the seal of the [[United States Department of Transportation]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

A triskelion shape is the basis for the [[roundel]] of the [[Irish Air Corps]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Aircraft Encyclopedia'' by Roy Braybrook, {{ISBN|0-671-55337-2}}, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; and the logo for the [[Trisquel]] [[Linux distribution]].

A triskelion shape was used in the design of RCA's "Spider" [[45 rpm adapter]], a popular plastic adapter for vinyl records, which allows larger center-holed 45 rpm records (commonly used on 7" singles and EPs) to spin on players designed for smaller center-holed 33-1/3 rpm records (the standard for 10" and 12" LPs). The design was practical, the three curved arms providing equal spring and thus keeping the hole centred. The iconic design of the Spider has led to its adoption as a popular symbol for record and music enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welove-music.com/blog/index.php/technology/45-rpm-adapters/ |title=We Love Life: Music - 45 RPM Adapters |publisher=Welove-music.com |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202110840/http://www.welove-music.com/blog/index.php/technology/45-rpm-adapters/ |archivedate=2009-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/12/05/twenty-45-adapters.html |title=Boing Boing: Gadgets - Twenty 45 adapters |publisher=Gadgets.boingboing.net|date=2008-12-05 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most commonly used symbols of the [[BDSM#Symbols|BDSM]] community is a derivation of a triskelion shape within a circle.&lt;ref name=Luminais&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luminais|first1=Misty|title=In the Habit of Being Kinky: Practice and Resistance in a BDSM Community, Texas, USA|date=May 2012|publisher=Washington State University|page=121|url=https://research.wsulibs.wsu.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/2376/4093/Luminais_wsu_0251E_10404.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South Africa|South African]] [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] [[White nationalism|White nationalist]] organization and political party [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] uses a Triskele composed of three sevens as its symbol in place of the [[Swastika|Nazi Swastika]].

The [[Flag of the Isle of Man]] bears 3 legs based on the Triskele.

The crest of the Breton [[association football|football]] club [[En Avant de Guingamp]] combines the [[Flag of Brittany]], the team colours and the triple spiral triskelion.

"[[The Gamesters of Triskelion]]" is a second-season episode of the American science fiction television series ''[[Star Trek]]''.

In the [[Marvel Universe]], the intelligence agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] uses the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] as its headquarters {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

The Triskele is also used as a prominent symbol in MTV's "[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV Series)]]" which draws heavily from Celtic mythology. A Triskele was used by some younger betas to keep from shifting &amp; maintain calm. This happens by the beta repeating "Alpha, Beta, Omega" or "The Sun, The Moon, The Truth" over and over again until the beta is calm.

In [[Merlin (2008 TV series)]] it was used as symbol of druids.

==Reconstructionists and neopagans==
The triskele, usually consisting of spirals, but also the "horned triskelion", is used by some [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|polytheistic reconstructionist]] and [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] groups. As a Celtic symbol, it is used primarily by groups with a Celtic cultural orientation and, less frequently, can also be found in use by various eclectic or syncretic traditions such as [[Neopaganism]]. The spiral triskele is one of the primary symbols of [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]].&lt;ref name="Bonewits"&gt;Bonewits, Isaac (2006) ''Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism''. New York, [[Kensington Books|Kensington]] Publishing Group {{ISBN|0-8065-2710-2}}. p. 132: [Among Celtic Reconstructionists] "...''An Thríbhís Mhòr'' (the great triple spiral) came into common use to refer to the three realms." Also p. 134: [On CRs] "Using Celtic symbols such as triskeles and [[triple spiral|spirals]]"&lt;/ref&gt; Celtic Reconstructionists use the symbol to represent a variety of triplicities in their cosmology and theology; it is also a favored symbol due to its association with the god [[Manannán mac Lir]].&lt;ref name="Bonewits"/&gt;

==Occurrence in nature==
The endocytic protein, [[clathrin]], is triskelion-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/potm/2007_4/Page1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ediacaran fossil [[Tribrachidium]] is also triskelion shaped.

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 038.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A wise old man: "Philosopher in Meditation" by [[Rembrandt]]]]
The '''wise old man''' (also called '''senex''', [[Sage (philosophy)|'''sage''' or '''sophos''']]) is an [[archetype]] as described by [[Carl Jung]], as well as a classic [[literature|literary]] figure, and may be seen as a [[stock character]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p 151, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wise old man can be a profound [[philosopher]] distinguished for [[wisdom]] and sound [[judgment]].

== Traits ==
This type of character is typically represented as a kind and wise, older father-type figure who uses personal knowledge of people and the world to help tell stories and offer guidance that, in a mystical way, may impress upon his audience a sense of who they are and who they might become, thereby acting as a [[mentor]].  He may occasionally appear as an [[absent-minded professor]], appearing absent-minded due to a predilection for contemplative pursuits.

The wise old man is often seen to be in some way "foreign", that is, from a different culture, nation, or occasionally, even a different time, from those he advises.  In extreme cases, he may be a [[liminal being]], such as [[Merlin]], who was only half human.

In medieval chivalric [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] and modern [[fantasy literature]], he is often presented as a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]].&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'', p 195, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He can also or instead be featured as a [[hermit]].  This character type often explained to the [[Monomyth|knights or heroes]]—particularly those searching for the [[Holy Grail]]—the significance of their encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Penelope Reed |last=Doob |title=The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell University Press |pages=179–181 |isbn=0-8014-8000-0 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In storytelling, the character of the wise old man is commonly killed or in some other way removed for a time, in order to allow the hero to develop on his/her own.

== Jungian psychology ==

In [[Carl Jung|Jung]]ian [[analytical psychology]], '''senex''' is the specific term used in association with this archetype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Terrapsychology: Reengaging the Soul of Place|last= Chalquist|first= Craig|year= 2007|publisher= Spring Journal Books|isbn= 978-1-882670-65-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Rome, the title of Senex ([[Latin]] for ''old man'') was only awarded to elderly men with families who had good standing in their village. Examples of the senex [[archetype]] in a positive form include the wise old man or [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]. The senex may also appear in a negative form as a devouring [[father]] (e.g. [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], [[Cronus]]) or a doddering [[Foolishness|fool]].

In the [[individuation]] process, the archetype of the Wise old man was late to emerge, and seen as an indication of the [[Self (Jung)|Self]].  'If an individual has wrestled seriously enough and long enough with the [[anima and animus|anima]] (or animus) problem...the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form...as a masculine initiator and guardian (an Indian ''guru''), a wise old man, a spirit of nature, and so forth'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marie-Luise von |last=Franz |chapter=The Process of Individuation |editor-first=C. G. |editor-last=Jung |editor-link=Carl Gustav Jung |title=Man and his Symbols |location=London |publisher=Picador |year=1978 |pages=207–208 |isbn=0-330-25321-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antithetical archetype, or [[enantiodromia|enantiodromic opposite]], of the senex is the [[Puer Aeternus]].

== Cultural references ==

In fiction, due to the influence of [[Merlin]], a wise old man is often presented in the form of a wizard or other [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] in medieval chivalric [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] and  modern [[fantasy literature]] and [[films]]; notable examples include [[Gandalf]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and [[Albus Dumbledore]] from ''[[Harry Potter]]''. See List of magicians in fantasy for more examples.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The Elder Kettle, who serves as a father figure to the Cup Brothers in ''[[Cuphead]]'', closely follows this role. When the brothers get roped into The Devil's scheme to gather the contracts, it is the Elder Kettle who helps the brothers in their plan to eventually turn against their master.

"Senex" is a name of a wise old character in the novel ''[[A Wind in the Door]]'' by [[Madeleine L'Engle]].

Sir [[Alan Lascelles]] used the pen-name "Senex" when writing to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1950 setting out the so-called [[Lascelles Principles]] concerning the monarch's right to refuse a prime minister's request for a general election.

A character in episode 7 of the anime [[Ergo Proxy]]  is named Senex Proxy, and is the Agent of Moonlight. She is killed by Ergo Proxy. It is possible the name Senex is in reference to the age, and immortality of the Proxies.

In the roleplaying game [[Mage: The Ascension]], Senex is the wise old leader of the Euthanatos magickal tradition. He dwells in a far distant realm, only rarely stepping onto Earth.
