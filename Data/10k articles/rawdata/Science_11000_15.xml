The '''A*STAR Talent Search (ATS)''' is a [[research]]-based [[science fair|science competition]] in [[Singapore]] for [[high school]] [[student]]s between 15–21 years of age.  It was formerly known as National Science Talent Search. The ATS is an annual competition which acknowledges and rewards students who have a strong aptitude for science &amp; technology. This competition provides students the opportunity to showcase their stellar projects and encourage them to further explore science and technology.

The ATS is administered by the [[Agency for Science, Technology and Research]] (A*STAR) and [[Science Centre Singapore]] (SCS) from 2006. Participants are required to compete in the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) and winners from the fair will then proceed to the short-listing round of ATS. The panel of judges consists of distinguished scientists from local and international universities, as well as A*STAR research institutes and a Nobel Laureate as the Chief Judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.edu.sg/events/Pages/astartalentsearch.aspx |title=A*STAR Talent Search |publisher=Science Centre Singapore |accessdate=2011-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813103248/http://www.science.edu.sg/events/Pages/astartalentsearch.aspx |archive-date=2011-08-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ATS winners need to display resourcefulness, mastery of scientific concepts, as well as passion for scientific research.&lt;ref name="ATS 2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.edu.sg/events/Pages/ats2011.aspx |title=A*STAR Talent Search 2011 |publisher=Science Centre Singapore |accessdate=2011-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314190555/http://www.science.edu.sg/events/Pages/ats2011.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Prize winner will be given S$5000, inclusive of a sponsored overseas conference.&lt;ref name="ATS 2011" /&gt;

Winners and finalists (top 8 students) of the ATS have gone on to top universities worldwide, such as [[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Yale University]], [[Stanford University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[California Institute of Technology]] in the United States, and [[University of Cambridge]], [[University of Oxford]] and [[Imperial College London]] in the United Kingdom.

The '''A4119''' links [[Tonypandy]] with [[Cardiff]] in [[South Wales]].

Settlements served by the route include [[Tonypandy]], [[Penygraig]], [[Williamstown, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Williamstown]], [[Tonyrefail]], [[Ynysmaerdy]], [[Talbot Green]], [[Llantrisant]], [[Groes-faen]], [[Creigiau]], [[Llandaff]], [[Canton, Cardiff|Canton]], [[Riverside, Cardiff|Riverside]], [[Grangetown, Cardiff|Grangetown]], [[Butetown]], [[Cardiff Bay]].

==City and County of Cardiff==
[[File:Cathedral Road Cardiff.jpg|thumb|Cathedral Road in Cardiff]]
The A4119 starts outside the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] at [[Cardiff Bay]] and proceeds  through [[Butetown]], [[Grangetown, Cardiff|Grangetown]], [[Riverside, Cardiff|Riverside]] and [[Cathedral Road]] in [[Canton, Cardiff|Canton]] until meeting the [[A48 road]] (Western Avenue) at [[Llandaff]].
From here is proceeds through Llandaff passing the [[BBC Wales]] studios. After leaving Llandaff the road takes on a more rural setting with many bends crossing the M4 Motorway near Capel Llanitern. From here the road snakes passed the settlement of [[Creigiau]].

==Rhondda Cynon Taf==
The road enters the [[County Borough]] of [[Rhondda Cynon Taf]] (formerly [[Mid Glamorgan]]) at [[Groes-faen]]. The road continues through the Village until it comes to a T-Junction at The Castell Mynach Public House. To the left is a Spur of the A4119 that links to Junction 34 of the [[M4 Motorway]]. Off the roundabout at the Junction is the [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] Electronics Plant.

The road continues after the t-junction past Miskin and Mwyndy.

===Development of Infrastructure in Talbot Green===
The A4119 through Talbot Green was first built Circa. 1977 {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} as a single carriageway passing to the side of the village straight on to Ely Valley Road, easing pressure off the original small lanes that lead from Talbot Green to the area known as Mwyndy, south of the village.  The road here was built at the same time as an extension of the original Talbot - Cardiff road, leading to Junction 34 of the [[M4 Motorway]], and creating better access to the lanes leading to the [[Vale of Glamorgan]].
At Mwyndy Cross, you can still see the original lane that the road used, signposted "Arthur Llewelyn Jenkins", the lane is accessible to the furniture store and as far as Cefn-y-Parc cemetery but is blocked at the bypass.
There is a roundabout with the [[A473|Talbot Green Bypass]] after passing Mwyndy Cross and the original roads - the A473 Pontypridd to Bridgend Road. This roundabout was added when the bypass was built in 1991 and was improved during mid 2016 to mid 2017 to add extra dedicated lanes and a traffic lighting system. Another roundabout, was located at the base of Llantrisant, where the A473 originally ran. When the bypass was built, it cut off the original main road from [[Cowbridge]] via [[Pontyclun]] and therefore traffic is forced to use the new Bypass.

The decision was made by [[Mid Glamorgan]] County Council in the early 1990s to dual the section of A4119 between Ynysmaerdy and Mwyndy. This would be the last major road project undertaken by Mid Glamorgan before its abolishment in 1996.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

[[File:A4119 near Llantrisant, Wales (Geograph 2441787 by Gareth James).jpg|thumb|The Talbot Green to Ynysmaerdy dual carriageway]] 

The completed "Talbot Green to Ynysmaerdy Dual Carriageway" officially opened on 28 July 1995.{{cn|date=January 2015}} The scheme replaced the old Roundabout near Llantrisant with a four way traffic-lit junction, and completely replaced the original Ely Valley Road at Talbot Green apart from the first portion: a t-junction from the centre Talbot Green's high street that leads to a row of houses and a Golf Club, this is the only remaining section Ely Valley Road that is un-altered, still bearing the original road surface and signage,{{cn|date=January 2015}} although it is now a [[Cul-de-sac]].
A department store called [[Co-operative Retail Services|Homeworld]] opened in the 1980s prior to the construction of the new Dual Carriageway at Talbot Green until the store was closed in 1999 and demolished in 2000.{{cn|date=January 2015}} This, alongside a [[Tesco]] Store marked the rush of new developments in the area, the original Tesco store which opened in the 1980s was closed and demolished in 2003, after it relocated to larger premises on the former Homeworld site. Talbot Green Shopping Park was built on the former Tesco site and opened in 2004.

At the next roundabout the road takes the shape of a bow passed the Ely Meadows which is now the site of Magden Park, a development of Offices, Hotel, Pub and private Health facility.&lt;ref&gt;http://rightacres.com/proj/office_12.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822060635/http://rightacres.com/proj/office_12.html |date=22 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bypassing the [[Royal Glamorgan Hospital]], [[Avionics]] department of [[British Airways]] and the Headquarters of the Welsh Blood Service.

On the south-bound carriageway is a long stretch of original road, although now a parking area where refreshment vans and sleepy truckers are a common sight, it provides access to some houses and a rural lane leading to Llantrisant.

The Road then comes to a roundabout with a turn off for the Llantrisant Industrial Park which is home to the [[Royal Mint]].

Another smaller roundabout at the village of Ynysmaerdy, where the new Headquarters of the [[South Wales Fire and Rescue Service]] is located,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwales-fire.gov.uk/English/aboutus/fireservicepublications/Documents/NEW%20HQ%20location%20plan%20-%20Bilingual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719202431/http://www.southwales-fire.gov.uk/English/aboutus/fireservicepublications/Documents/NEW%20HQ%20location%20plan%20-%20Bilingual.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; marks the end of the Dual Carriageway, the road becomes a single carriageway again at this point.

=== Ely and Rhondda Valleys ===

Past Ynysmaerdy the duel carriage way merged into a single lane to climb a hill, which is known locally as "Stink Pot Hill" because of the sewerage works that is on the side of the road.{{cn|date=January 2015}} 

At the next roundabout the road splits, this is where a bypass separates from the original course of the A4119. The old road through the village of [[Coed-Ely]] is to the right. The bypass, completed in 1987, takes the route of the old Ely Valley Railway, and the former site of the Coed-Ely Colliery is on the left. From here the road is still single carriageway with numerous rest areas. The road continues on another bypass past [[Tonyrefail]].
Shortly after Tonyrefail the road once again forks, with a junction for the A4233 which links with [[Trebanog]] and [[Porth]]. The A4119 from here follows the floor of the Valley through woodland and past a small industrial estate with the Village of [[Williamstown, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Williamstown]]. At this roundabout the A4119 meets momentarily with its original course before continuing along the old Railway line. The route then bypasses the village of [[Penygraig]] and south of [[Tonypandy]] where is progresses down a steep incline. There is a spur with [[Clydach Vale]] before the road, still following an old railway line, progresses down to the floor of the valley where the A4119 ends with a roundabout of the A4058.
Originally the A4119 continued along Colliers Way and Llwynypia Road, where it again followed its original course, to a Terminus at Llwynypia Hospital with the [[A4058]], but following the completion of the Porth Relief Road, the roads were re-numbered. Therefore, Colliers Way and the Tonypandy North Bypass are now part of the A4058 [[Pontypridd]] to [[Treorchy]] route.

In  the [[construction]] industry, an aggregate (often referred to as a [[construction aggregate]]) is [[sand]], [[gravel]] or crushed rock that has been [[mining|mined]] or [[Quarry|quarried]] for use as a [[building material]].

In [[Pedology (soil study)|pedology]], an aggregate is a mass of soil particles. If the aggregate has formed naturally, it can be called a [[ped]]; if formed artificially, it can be called a clod.&lt;ref name="Allaby1999"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Dictionary of Earth Sciences (2nd edition) | publisher=Oxford University Press | last=Allaby | first=Ailsa | last2=Allaby | first2=Michael | year=1999 | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-280079-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atom Trap Trace Analysis''' ('''ATTA''') is an extremely sensitive trace analysis method developed by Argonne National Lab (ANL). ATTA is used on long-lived, stable radioisotopes such as {{math|&lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;Kr}}, {{math|&lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Kr}}, and {{math|&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar}}. By using a laser that is locked to an atomic transition, a CCD or PMT will detect the laser induced fluorescence to allow highly selective, parts-per-trillion to parts-per-quadrillion concentration measurement with single atom detection.&lt;ref name="Chen1999"&gt;{{cite journal

ATTA measurements are possible only if the atoms are excited to a metastable state prior to detection. The main difficulty to accomplishing this is the large energy gap (10-20 eV) between the ground and excited state. The current solution is to use an RF discharge, which is a brute force technique that is inefficient and leads to complications such contamination of the walls from ion sputtering and high gas density. A new scheme for generating a metastable beam which can achieve a cleaner, slower, and preferably more intense source would provide a substantial advance to ATTA technology. All-optical techniques have been considered, but have not yet been able to compete with the discharge source.&lt;ref name="Kohler2014"&gt;{{cite journal

In [[botany]], an '''awn''' is either a hair- or bristle-like appendage on a larger structure, or in the case of the [[Asteraceae]], a stiff needle-like element of the [[pappus (flower structure)|pappus]].

Awns are characteristic of various plant families, including [[Geraniaceae]] and many [[grass]]es ([[Poaceae]]). 

==Description==
In grasses awns typically extend from the [[lemma (botany)|lemma]]s of the [[floret]]s. This often makes the hairy appearance of the grass [[Inflorescence#Compound inflorescences|synfloresce]]. Awns may be long (several centimeters) or short, straight or curved, single or multiple per floret. Some [[genera]] are named after their awns, such as the [[three-awn]]s (''Aristida'').

In some [[species]], the awns can contribute significantly to [[photosynthesis]], as, for example, in [[barley]].

The awns of wild [[emmer]] wheat spikelets effectively [[self-cultivate]] by propelling themselves mechanically into [[soil]]s.  During a period of increased [[humidity]] during the night, the awns of the spikelet become erect and draw together, and in the process push the grain into the soil.  During the daytime the humidity drops and the awns slacken back again; however, fine [[silica]] hairs on the awns act as [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] hooks in the soil and prevent the spikelets from reversing back out again.  During the course of alternating stages of daytime and nighttime humidity, the awns' pumping movements, which resemble a swimming [[frog kick]], drill the spikelet as much as an inch into the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Elbaum | first = Rivka | authorlink = |author2= Zaltzman, Liron|author3= Burgert, Ingo|author4= Fratzl, Peter | year = 2007 | month = | title = The Role of Wheat Awns in the Seed Dispersal Unit | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 316 | issue = 5826 | pages = 884&amp;ndash;886 | doi = 10.1126/science.1140097 | url = | accessdate = | quote =| pmid = 17495170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When awns occur in the Geraniaceae, they form the distal (rostral) points of the five carpels, lying parallel in the style above the ovary. Depending on the species, such awns have various seed dispersal functions, either dispersing the seed by flinging it out (seed ejection); flinging away the entire carpel so that it snaps off (carpel projection);&lt;ref&gt;Yeo, P.

'''Birth dearth''' is a [[neologism]] referring to falling [[fertility rate]]s.  In the late 1980s, the term was used in the context of [[United States|American]] and [[Europe]]an society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/books/be-fruitful-and-multiply.html "Be Fruitful and Multiply"], Jamar Jacoby, ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 12, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of the term has since been expanded to include many other [[industrialized nation]]s. It is often cited as a response to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], but is not incompatible with it. The term was coined by [[Ben Wattenberg]] in his 1987 book by that same name.
Countries and geographic regions that are currently experiencing falling population include Russia, Europe, Japan, and populations of people of these descents in other countries such as in the United States.

== Russia ==
[[Russia]] is often mentioned in articles concerning birth dearth because of its rapidly declining population, and the proposal by [[Vladimir Putin]] to offer women additional benefits for having more children. It is predicted that Russia's population will be an estimated 111 million in 2050, instead to 147 million in 2000 if current trends continue, according to the UN World Population Prospects report (2004 Revision, medium variant).

== Europe ==
{{Main|Aging of Europe}}
[[Europe]] is one of the few major geographic regions in the World that is expected to ''decline'' in [[population]] in the coming years. Europe's population is forecast to decline by nearly 70 million people by 2050,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_GraphicalDisplay.aspx?ListNames=%22Population,%20History%20and%20Forecast%22&amp;HistFor=True&amp;GrpOp=1&amp;Dim1=%22Europe%22&amp;File=0 |publisher=International Futures |title=Population of Europe, History plus Forecast |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[total fertility rate]] has remained perpetually below the replacement rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_GraphicalDisplay.aspx?ListNames=%22Total%20Fertility%20Rate,%20History%20plus%20Forecast%22&amp;HistFor=True&amp;GrpOp=1&amp;Dim1=%22Europe%22&amp;File=0 |publisher=International Futures |title=Total Fertility Rate of Europe, History plus Forecast |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Further information: [[Sub-replacement fertility]] and [[Population decline]])

Colemanite is a secondary mineral that forms by alteration of [[borax]] and [[ulexite]].&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt;

It was first described in 1884 for an occurrence near [[Furnace Creek, California|Furnace Creek]] in [[Death Valley]] and was named after [[William Tell Coleman]] (1824–1893), owner of the mine "Harmony Borax Works" where it was first found.&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;  At the time, Coleman had alternatively proposed the name "smithite" instead after his business associate [[Francis Marion Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, GH.

==Uses==
Colemanite is an important [[ore]] of [[boron]], and was the most important boron ore until the discovery of [[kernite]] in 1926. It has many industrial uses, like the manufacturing of heat resistant glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Nitrates |date=1977 |title=Simon &amp; Schuster's Guide to Rocks and Minerals |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-24417-0 |page=entry 111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6264">{{lowercase|da Vinci Project}}
The '''Da Vinci Project''' was a privately funded, volunteer-staffed attempt to launch a reusable manned [[suborbital]] [[spacecraft]].  It was formed in 1996 specifically to be a contender for the [[Ansari X PRIZE]] for the first non-governmental reusable manned spacecraft.  The project was based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] and led by Brian Feeney.&lt;ref name="space.com-delay"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/368-canadian-prize-team-delays-launch-attempt.html | title=Canadian X Prize Team Delays Launch Attempt | publisher=Purch | date=24 September 2004 | accessdate=September 20, 2012 | author=Malik, Tariq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original da Vinci Project is no longer operating.  A documentary was filmed throughout much of the project's life from 2000 through post-XPRIZE roundup footage in 2008. The documentary accumulated some 1000 hours or so of footage. It was a private undertaking by Michel Jones of Riverstone Productions, Toronto, and as of early 2009 was still in a preliminary stage of editing and completion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The project last  participated in the [[X PRIZE]] Cup 2005, displaying a mock-up of its '''Wild Fire''' MK Vl spacecraft.

==Spacecraft design==
The project's design was a [[rocket]]-powered [[spacecraft]] to be [[air launch|air-launched]] from a helium balloon at an altitude of about 21&amp;nbsp;km (65,000&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3539018.stm | title=Second team goes for space prize | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=5 August 2004 | accessdate=September 20, 2012 | author=Twist, Jo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project scope included design and construction of both the spacecraft and the launching balloon.&lt;ref name="space.com-delay" /&gt; The chosen design can be described as a manned [[rockoon]].

==History and status==
The project was established in 1996. It is named after [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who, among innumerable other inventions, was the first recorded person to design an aircraft. The project was staffed entirely by volunteers.&lt;ref name="space.com-race"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/192-great-space-race-spaceshipone-wild-fire-gold.html | title=The Next Great Space Race: SpaceShipOne and Wild Fire to Go For the Gold | publisher=Purch | date=27 July 2004 | accessdate=September 20, 2012 | author=David, Leonard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project unveiled a mockup of their spacecraft, Wild Fire, on August 5, 2004 at a hangar at [[Toronto/Downsview Airport|Downsview Airport]] in [[Toronto]]. At this point, it was considered a contender for the [[Ansari X PRIZE]], and [[Scaled Composites Tier One|Tier One]] had just given notice of their planned competitive flights.  When announcing the unveiling, the da Vinci Project also appealed for funds to fly Wild Fire.  An agreement was reached with [[GoldenPalace.com]], and the project subsequently gave the required 60-day notice that they would make [[Ansari X PRIZE]] competitive flights.&lt;ref name="space.com-race" /&gt; GoldenPallace.com, known for its marketing gimicks, will place a soccer ball kicked out of the stadium by [[David Beckham]] during the 2004 Euro World Cup inside the space craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/06/beckham_ball_lost_in_space/ | title=Beckham penalty outrage ball heads for space: bid for infamous sphere | publisher=[[The Register]] | date=6 August 2004 | accessdate=September 20, 2012 | author=Leyden, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The da Vinci Project initially announced that it would fly first on October 2, 2004, launching from [[Kindersley, Saskatchewan]].  This was only three days after the first expected X PRIZE flight, by [[Scaled Composites]], on September 29, 2004.  However, on September 23, 2004 the da Vinci project announced that they would not be ready.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Scaled Composites won the X PRIZE on October 4, 2004.

==Hardware==

{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}

The rocket and support equipment was mostly COTS components with a hybrid propulsion system using nitrous oxide and a spin cast paraffin fuel engine in a re-loadable and expendable cardboard cartridge. The most notable development problem was finding a practical low cost solution to the thermal contraction of the liquid paraffin fuel when it cooled and solidified inside the cartridge inner casing.
The capsule used two automotive racing seats and aviation BRS parachute systems and was designed and modeled with finite element software. The nozzle was carbon fiber exterior with a tough, thermally insulating inner coating. The combustion chamber was metallic, although a wound carbon fiber exterior was planned but never completed. The planned tracking system used a four car team with networked laptop computers using a hybrid cellular and shortwave radio with the capability of automatically predicting the landing spot so a support team could converge on the landing spot hand prior to landing. The highest forces were predicted to be at re-entry, peaking at approximately at up to 6G. Development, construction and testing continued in earnest until the second flight of the X Prize on October 4th, 2004.

==Structure==
The project had a small group of core area leaders and relied heavily on volunteer efforts. It followed a variety of business models including share ownership partners, technology partnerships, employee style volunteering, integrator as well as technology/IP aggregator. Many of the expensive components were donated by businesses in exchange for recognition on the website homepage, since removed.

'''Data assimilation''' is a mathematical discipline that seeks to optimally combine theory (usually in the form of a numerical model) with observations. There may be a number of different goals sought, for example—to determine the optimal state estimate of a system, to determine initial conditions for a numerical forecast model, to interpolate sparse observation data using (e.g. physical) knowledge of the system being observed, to train numerical model parameters based on observed data. Depending on the goal, different solution methods may be used. Data assimilation is distinguished from other forms of machine learning, image analysis, and statistical methods in that it utilizes a dynamical model of the system being analyzed.

Data assimilation initially developed in the field of [[numerical weather prediction]]. Numerical weather prediction models are equations describing the dynamical behavior of the atmosphere, typically coded into a computer program. In order to use these models to make forecasts, initial conditions are needed for the model that closely resemble the current state of the atmosphere. Simply inserting point-wise measurements into the numerical models did not provide a satisfactory solution. Real world measurements contain errors both due to the quality of the instrument and how accurately the position of the measurement is known. These errors can cause instabilities in the models that eliminate any level of skill in a forecast. Thus, more sophisticated methods were needed in order to initialize a model using all available data while making sure to maintain stability in the numerical model. Such data typically includes the measurements as well as a previous forecast valid at the same time the measurements are made. If applied iteratively, this process begins to accumulate information from past observations into all subsequent forecasts.

Because data assimilation developed out of the field of numerical weather prediction, it initially gained popularity amongst the geosciences. In fact, one of the most cited publication in all of the geosciences is an application of data assimilation to reconstruct the observed history of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1996)077&lt;0437:TNYRP&gt;2.0.CO;2 |title=The NCEP/NCAR 40-Year Reanalysis Project |journal=BAMS |volume=77 |issue=March |pages=437 |year=1996 |last1=Kalnay |first1=Eugenia |last2=and coauthors }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the Data Assimilation Process==

Classically, data assimilation has been applied to chaotic dynamical systems that are too difficult to predict using simple extrapolation methods. The cause of this difficulty is that small changes in initial conditions can lead to large changes in prediction accuracy. This is sometimes known as the [[butterfly effect]] - the sensitive dependence on [[initial condition]]s in which a small change in one state of a [[deterministic]] [[nonlinear system]] can result in large differences in a later state.

At any update time, data assimilation usually takes a '''forecast''' (also known as the '''first guess''', or '''background''' information) and applies a correction to the forecast based on a set of observed data and estimated errors that are present in both the observations and the forecast itself. The difference between the forecast and the observations at that time is called the '''departure''' or the '''innovation''' (as it provides new information to the data assimilation process). A weighting factor is applied to the innovation to determine how much of a correction should be made to the forecast based on the new information from the observations. The best estimate of the state of the system based on the correction to the forecast determined by a weighting factor times the innovation is called the '''analysis'''. In one dimension, computing the analysis could be as simple as forming a weighted average of a forecasted and observed value. In multiple dimensions the problem becomes more difficult. Much of the work in data assimilation is focused on adequately estimating the appropriate weighting factor based on intricate knowledge of the errors in the system.

The measurements are usually made of a real-world system, rather than of the model's incomplete representation of that system, and so a special function called the '''observation operator''' (usually depicted by ''h()'' for a nonlinear operator or '''H''' for its linearization) is needed to map the modeled variable to a form that can be directly compared with the observation.

==Data assimilation as statistical estimation==
One of the common mathematical philosophical perspectives is to view data assimilation as a Bayesian estimation problem. From this perspective, the analysis step is an application of [[Bayes' theorem]] and the overall assimilation procedure is an example of [[recursive Bayesian estimation]]. However, the probabilistic analysis is usually simplified to a computationally feasible form. Advancing the probability distribution in time would be done exactly in the general case by the [[Fokker-Planck equation]], but that is not feasible for high-dimensional systems, so various approximations operating on simplified [[Representation (mathematics)|representations]] of the probability distributions are used instead. Often the probability distributions are assumed Gaussian so that they can be represented by their mean and covariance, which gives rise to the [[Kalman filter]].

Many methods represent the probability distributions only by the mean and input some pre-calculated covariance. An example of a '''direct''' (or '''sequential''') method to compute this is called optimal statistical interpolation, or simply optimal interpolation ('''OI'''). An alternative approach is to iteratively solve a cost function that solves an identical problem. These are called '''variational''' methods, such as 3D-Var and 4D-Var. Typical minimization algorithms are the [[Conjugate gradient method]] or the [[Generalized minimal residual method]]. The [[Ensemble Kalman filter]] is sequential method that uses a Monte Carlo approach to estimate both the mean and the covariance of a Gaussian probability distribution by an ensemble of simulations. More recently, hybrid combinations of ensemble approaches and variational methods have become more popular (e.g. they are used for operational forecasts both at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)).

==Weather forecasting applications==

In numerical weather prediction applications, data assimilation is most widely known as a method for combining observations of meteorological variables such as [[temperature]] and [[atmospheric pressure]] with prior forecasts in order to initialize numerical forecast models.

===Why it is necessary===
The [[atmosphere]] is a [[fluid]]. The idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[thermodynamics]] to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future.  The process of entering observation data into the model to generate [[initial value problem|initial conditions]] is called ''initialization''. On land, terrain maps available at resolutions down to {{convert|1|km|mi|1|sp=us}} globally are used to help model atmospheric circulations within regions of rugged topography, in order to better depict features such as downslope winds, [[Lee wave|mountain wave]]s and related cloudiness that affects incoming solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMXSpRwKNO8C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=radiation+mountain+parameterization+book#v=onepage&amp;q=radiation%20mountain%20parameterization%20book&amp;f=false|title=Parameterization schemes: keys to understanding numerical weather prediction models|author=Stensrud, David J.|page=56|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2011-02-15|isbn=978-0-521-86540-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main inputs from country-based weather services are observations from devices (called [[radiosonde]]s) in weather balloons  that measure  various atmospheric parameters and transmits them to a fixed receiver, as well as from [[weather satellite]]s. The [[World Meteorological Organization]] acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide.

===History===
[[Image:Lewis Fry Richardson.png|thumb|right|Lewis Fry Richardson]]
In 1922, [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] published the first attempt at forecasting the weather numerically. Using a [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|hydrostatic]] variation of [[Vilhelm Bjerknes|Bjerknes's]] [[primitive equations]],&lt;ref name="Lynch JCP"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcp.2007.02.034 |title=The origins of computer weather prediction and climate modeling |journal=Journal of Computational Physics |volume=227 |issue=7 |pages=3431–3444 |year=2008 |last1=Lynch |first1=Peter |bibcode=2008JCoPh.227.3431L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson produced by hand a 6-hour forecast for the state of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so.&lt;ref name="Lynch Ch1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynch|first=Peter|title=The Emergence of Numerical Weather Prediction|year=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-85729-1|pages=1–27|chapter=Weather Prediction by Numerical Process}}&lt;/ref&gt; His forecast calculated that the change in [[atmospheric pressure|surface pressure]] would be {{convert|145|mbar|inHg|lk=on}}, an unrealistic value incorrect by two orders of magnitude. The large error was caused by an imbalance in the pressure and wind velocity fields used as the initial conditions in his analysis,&lt;ref name="Lynch JCP"/&gt; indicating the need for a data assimilation scheme.

Originally "subjective analysis" had been used in which NWP forecasts had been adjusted by meteorologists using their operational expertise. Then "objective analysis" (e.g. Cressman algorithm) was introduced for automated data assimilation. These objective methods used simple interpolation approaches, and thus were 3DDA methods.

Later, 4DDA methods, called "nudging", were developed, such as in the [[MM5 (weather model)|MM5]] model. They are based on the simple idea of Newtonian relaxation (the 2nd axiom of Newton). They introduce into the right part of dynamical equations of the model a term that is proportional to the difference of the calculated meteorological variable and the observed value. This term that has a negative sign keeps the calculated [[State space (controls)|state vector]] closer to the observations. Nudging can be interpreted as a variant of the [[Kalman-Bucy filter]] (a continuous time version of the [[Kalman filter]]) with the gain matrix prescribed rather than obtained from covariances.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A major development was achieved by L. Gandin (1963) who introduced the "statistical interpolation" (or "optimal interpolation") method, which developed earlier ideas of Kolmogorov.  This is a 3DDA method and is a type of [[regression analysis]] which utilizes information about the spatial distributions of [[covariance]] functions of the errors of the "first guess" field (previous forecast) and "true field". These functions are never known. However, the different approximations were assumed.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The optimal interpolation algorithm is the reduced version of the [[Kalman filtering]] (KF) algorithm and in which the covariance matrices are not calculated from the dynamical equations but are pre-determined in advance.
 
Attempts to introduce the KF algorithms as a 4DDA tool for NWP models came later. However, this was (and remains) a difficult task because the full version requires solution of the enormous number of additional equations (~N*N~10**12, where N=Nx*Ny*Nz is the size of the state vector, Nx~100, Ny~100, Nz~100 - the dimensions of the computational grid). To overcome this difficulty, approximate or suboptimal Kalman filters were developed. These include the [[Ensemble Kalman filter]] and the Reduced-Rank Kalman filters (RRSQRT).&lt;ref&gt;Todling and Cohn, 1994{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant advance in the development of the 4DDA methods was utilizing the [[optimal control]] theory (variational approach) in the works of Le Dimet and Talagrand (1986), based on the previous works of G. Marchuk, who was the first to apply that theory in the environmental modeling. The significant advantage of the variational approaches is that the meteorological fields satisfy the dynamical equations of the NWP model and at the same time they minimize the functional, characterizing their difference from observations. Thus, the problem of constrained minimization is solved. The 3DDA variational methods were developed for the first time by Sasaki (1958).

As was shown by Lorenc (1986), all the above-mentioned 4DDA methods are in some limit equivalent, i.e. under some assumptions they minimize the same [[Loss function|cost function]]. However, in practical applications these assumptions are never fulfilled, the different methods perform differently and generally it is not clear what approach (Kalman filtering or variational) is better. The fundamental questions also arise in application of the advanced DA techniques such as convergence of the computational method to the global minimum of the functional to be minimised. For instance, cost function or the set in which the solution is sought can be not convex. The 4DDA method which is currently most successful&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/91Annual/webprogram/Paper181664.html | title=Abstract: Mesoscale ensemble 4DVAR and its comparison with EnKF and 4DVAR (91st American Meteorological Society Annual Meeting)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hfip.psu.edu/EDA2010/MZhang.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is hybrid incremental 4D-Var, where an ensemble is used to augment the climatological background error covariances at the start of the data assimilation time window, but the background error covariances are evolved during the time window by a simplified version of the NWP forecast model. This data assimilation method is used operationally at forecast centres such as the [[Met Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2011/14950-hybrid-variationalensemble-data-assimilation.pdf |title=Hybrid Variational/Ensemble Data Assimilation |first1=Dale |last1=Barker |first2=Andrew |last2=Lorenc |first3=Adam |last3=Clayton |date=September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/unified-model/weather-forecasting{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost function===
The process of creating the analysis in data assimilation often involves minimization of a [[Loss function|cost function]].  A typical cost function would be the sum of the squared deviations of the analysis values from the observations weighted by the accuracy of the observations, plus the sum of the squared deviations of the forecast fields and the analyzed fields weighted by the accuracy of the forecast.  This has the effect of making sure that the analysis does not drift too far away from observations and forecasts that are known to usually be reliable.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

provided that &lt;math&gt;\mathit{H}&lt;/math&gt; is a linear operator (matrix).

===Future development===

Factors driving the rapid development of data assimilation methods for NWP models include:

* Utilizing the observations currently offers promising improvement in [[forecast skill]] at a variety of spatial scales (from global to highly local) and time scales.
* The number of different kinds of available observations ([[sodar]]s, [[radar]]s, [[satellite]]) is rapidly growing.

=== Other forecasting applications ===
Data assimilation methods are currently also used in other environmental forecasting problems, e.g. in [[Hydrology|hydrological]] forecasting. Basically, the same types of data assimilation methods as those described above are in use there.  An example of chemical data assimilation using [[Autochem]] can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20060717223237/http://www.cdacentral.info/ CDACentral].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Given the abundance of spacecraft data for other planets in the solar system, data assimilation is now also applied beyond the Earth to obtain re-analyses of the atmospheric state of extraterrestrial planets. Mars is the only extraterrestrial planet to which data assimilation has been applied so far. Available spacecraft data include, in particular, retrievals of temperature and dust/water ice optical ticknesses from the Thermal Emission Spectrometer onboard NASA's [[Mars Global Surveyor]] and the Mars Climate Sounder onboard NASA's [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]. Two methods of data assimilation have been applied to these datasets: an Analysis Correction scheme &lt;ref name="montabone"&gt;http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/group/gpfd/research.html#marsgcm{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two Ensemble Kalman Filter schemes,&lt;ref name="hoffman"&gt;http://www.eps.jhu.edu/~mjhoffman/pages/research.html{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wrf"&gt;http://www.marsclimatecenter.com&lt;/ref&gt; both using a global circulation model of the martian atmosphere as forward model. The Mars Analysis Correction Data Assimilation (MACDA) dataset is publicly available from the British Atmospheric Data Centre.&lt;ref name="badc"&gt;http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/home/{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data assimilation is a part of the challenge for every forecasting problem.

Dealing with biased data is a serious challenge in data assimilation. Further development of methods to deal with biases will be of particular use. If there are several instruments observing the same variable then intercomparing them using [[probability distribution function]]s can be instructive.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The numerical forecast models are becoming of higher resolution due to the increase of [[computational power]], with operational atmospheric models now running with horizontal resolutions of order of 1&amp;nbsp;km (e.g. at the German National Meteorological Service, the [https://www.dwd.de Deutscher Wetterdienst (&lt;abbr&gt;DWD&lt;/abbr&gt;)] and [[Met Office]] in the UK). This increase in horizontal resolutions is starting to allow us to resolve more chaotic features of our non-linear models, e.g. resolve [[convection]] on the grid scale, clouds, in the atmospheric models. This increasing non-linearity in the models and [[Inverse problem|observation operators]] poses a new problem in the data assimilation. The existing data assimilation methods such as many variants of [[ensemble Kalman filter]]s and variational methods, well established with linear or near-linear models, are being assessed on non-linear models, as well as many new methods are being developed e.g. [[particle filter]]s for high-dimensional problems, hybrids data assimilation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vetra-Carvalho|first=Sanita|last2=P.

==Origins==
Chemistry has a long history at Oxford University.  The early pioneer of chemistry [[Robert Boyle]] and his assistant [[Robert Hooke]] began working in Oxford in the mid-seventeenth century.  A chemistry laboratory was built in the basement of the [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford|Old Ashmolean Building]] in 1683, which was used until 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashmolean.org/about/historyandfuture/ |title=History of the Ashmolean |work=Ashmolean Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical research was also conducted in laboratories set up in individual colleges &amp;ndash; [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] (1767), [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen]] (Daubeny Laboratory, 1848), [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] (1853, later joined with [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity]] to become the [[Balliol-Trinity Laboratories]]), [[Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's]] (1900), and [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus]] (1907).&lt;ref name="chemistry"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=faf1nMjVRYwC&amp;pg=PA275 |title=Chemistry at Oxford: A History from 1600 to 2005|author1=Robert Joseph Paton Williams |author2=Allan Chapman |author3=John Shipley Rowlinson |page=275 | publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |date=6 November 2008|isbn= 978-0854041398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemistry was first recognized as a separate discipline at Oxford with the building of a laboratory attached to the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], opening in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/history/ | title=History of Chemistry at the University of Oxford | publisher=Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford | location=UK | accessdate=25 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory is a small octagonal structure to the right of the museum, built in stone in the [[Victorian Gothic architecture|Victorian Gothic]] style. The design was based on the [[Abbot's Kitchen, Glastonbury|Abbot's Kitchen]] at [[Glastonbury]] and it adopted the [[Abbot's Kitchen, Oxford|same name]] despite being a laboratory. The building was one of the first ever purpose-built chemical laboratories anywhere and was extended in 1878.

'''Douglas Vakoch''' (born June 16, 1961) is an American search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) researcher, psychologist, and president of [[METI International]] (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence), a nonprofit research and educational organization devoted to transmitting intentional signals to extraterrestrial civilizations. Vakoch led METI's participation in Sónar Calling GJ 273b, which transmitted a series of interstellar messages to Luyten's Star, located 12.4 light years from Earth. Vakoch advocates ongoing transmission projects, arguing that this does not increase risks of an alien invasion as suggested by British cosmologist Stephen Hawking. He has participated in several SETI observation programs, and after sixteen years at the SETI Institute, where he was director of Interstellar Message Composition, Vakoch founded METI International. He has edited over a dozen books in SETI, astrobiology, the psychology of space exploration, and ecocriticism. He is general editor of two book series in ecocriticism and in the intersection of space and society. Vakoch has appeared widely on television and radio as a commentator on SETI and astrobiology. He is an emeritus professor of clinical psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS).

== Early life and education ==

== Active Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Active SETI) ==
Vakoch argues that in order to make contact, humankind may need to take the initiative in transmitting, a project called [[active SETI]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winerman|first=Lea|date=October 2015|title=Hello?

Within each 11-minute transmission, the tutorial was sent three times.&lt;ref name=":58" /&gt; The only element of the tutorial that changed with each repetition was the time indicated on a "cosmic clock."&lt;ref name=":58" /&gt; A novel feature of this clock is that it explains the passage of time by making reference to the duration of radio pulses themselves, meant to increase its intelligibility.&lt;ref name=":61" /&gt; Luyten's Star was chosen as the target of the transmission because it is the nearest star visible from the EISCAT facility that is known to be orbited by an exoplanet in the star's habitable zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/16/messaging-aliens-with-music-but-are-they-hip-to-technopop/|title=How we’ll serenade aliens with music|last=Krieger|first=Lisa M.|date=2017-11-16|work=The Mercury News|access-date=2018-02-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transmission from Tromsø was announced on November 16, 2017, on the 43rd anniversary of the transmission of the [[Arecibo message]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-11-18|title=Nanoo nanoo|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21731380-including-clock-some-trigonometry-and-some-jean-michel-jarre-how-send|journal=The Economist|volume=425|issue=9067|pages=70|doi=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vakoch said that METI's tutorial is "distinctive because it's designed with extraterrestrial SETI scientists in mind. We sent the sort of signal we'd want to receive here on Earth."&lt;ref name=":59" /&gt; The repetition of the tutorial three times each day, which was repeated across three days, provides extraterrestrial scientists with an opportunity to conduct follow-up observations to confirm the signal. "This sort of confirmation is essential to having a credible SETI signal," Vakoch told ''[[CNET]]''. "The last thing we want to do is send the aliens a [[Wow! signal|Wow! Signal]] that's seen only once, but never replicated."

Vakoch noted that many past interstellar messages attempted to be encyclopedic, with the risk that by attempting to explain everything, the message may be unintelligible.&lt;ref name=":64" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.de/collection/science/hallo-gj-273b-ausserirdische-zu-hause|title=Hallo, GJ 273b!

"You’re not going to be a very good engineer, on Earth or GJ 273b, if you don’t know that one plus one equals two," Vakoch told ''[[Forbes]]''.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billretherford/2017/12/29/anyone-out-there-meti-scientists-message-alien-world/#4dd482f56e34|title=Anyone Out There?

Given the distance between Earth and GJ 273b, a response could be received in less than 25 years. "I think that’s an unlikely outcome," Vakoch told ''[[New Scientist]]'', "but it would be a welcome outcome."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2153461-we-just-sent-a-message-to-try-to-talk-to-aliens-on-another-world/|title=We just sent a message to try to talk to aliens on another world|last=Falk|first=Dan|date=2017-11-16|work=New Scientist|access-date=2018-02-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a response comes, however, that means "the galaxy is chock-full of alien life," he told ''[[Forbes]]''.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Instead Vakoch suggested the process would need likely need to be replicated with many additional targets to receive a response. "It is a prototype for what I think we would most likely need to do 100 times, or 1,000 times, or 1 million times," he told ''[[Space.com]]''. "To me, the big success of the project will come if, 25 years from now, there's someone who remembers to look [for a response]. If we could accomplish that, that would be a radical shift of perspective."&lt;ref name=":60" /&gt; METI plans to repeat this process with other stars.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

Vakoch says that intentional transmissions to GJ 273b do not increase the risk of an alien invasion, contrary to the concerns of Stephen Hawking, telling ''[[Space.com]]'' that "[i]t's really hard to imagine a scenario in which a civilization around Luyten's star could have the capacity to come to Earth and threaten us, and yet they're not able to pick up our leakage radiation."&lt;ref name=":60" /&gt; He added that evidence of microbial life on Earth has been detectable even longer: "Any civilization that is capable of an alien invasion is already privy to our existence. Earth's atmosphere has been giving off evidence of the existence of life for two and a half billion years, by virtue of the oxygen in our atmosphere, so any paranoid aliens have had plenty of time to do us harm. There's no sign they've been here."&lt;ref name=":59" /&gt; 

When asked whether he thought the announcement of Sónar Calling GJ 273b would upset some within the SETI community, Vakoch told ''[[Newsweek]]'' that "[e]veryone engaged in SETI is already endorsing transmissions to extraterrestrials through their actions. If we detect a signal from aliens through a SETI program, there’s no way to prevent a cacophony of responses from Earth.... Once the news gets out that we’ve detected extraterrestrials, anyone with a transmitter can say whatever they want."&lt;ref name=":58" /&gt; Vakoch says that some in the SETI community have criticized Active SETI as a viable strategy precisely because of the challenges of undertaking long-term projects.&lt;ref name=":60" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=GOOD Magazine|title=Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence {{!}} GOOD &amp; Hennessy|date=2017-11-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLWL-24GMo|accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vakoch noted that efforts like Sónar Calling GJ 273b are not replacements for traditional passive SETI projects, but rather provide a complementary strategy.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

Vakoch has participated in public discussions about interstellar communication, arguing in favor of initiating transmission projects. This included a debate hosted by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) at its annual convention, held in San Jose, California on February 13, 2015 .&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/02/researchers-call-interstellar-messages-alien-civilizations|title=Researchers call for interstellar messages to alien civilizations|last=Hand|first=Eric|date=2015-02-12|work=Science|access-date=2017-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en|doi=10.1126/science.aaa7855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Science Show|first=|title=Come in extra-terrestrials|date=2015-02-21|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/come-in-extra-terrestrials/6163780#transcript|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|language=en-AU|accessdate=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[W]e should expand our strategies, so we are not only passively listening, but also transmitting intentional, information-rich signals," Vakoch said at the AAAS meeting, adding that "[w]ith recent detections of Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of other stars, we have natural targets for such transmission projects."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/11410231/We-should-make-first-contact-scientists-say-it-is-time-to.html|title=We should make first contact: scientists say it is time to search for aliens|last=Knapton|first=Sarah|date=2015-02-13|work=Telegraph|access-date=2017-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vakoch told the ''[[Associated Press]]'' that active SETI is an “attempt to join the galactic club,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/tech/science/2015/02/13/cosmos-aliens/23388693/|title=Scientists at odds over contacting cosmic life|last=Borenstein|first=Seth|date=2015-02-13|work=Detroit News|access-date=2017-04-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=Associated Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he argues that "it’s a reflection of the natural growth that you see in the science"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3056192/the-search-for-alien-life-is-getting-bigger-weirder-and-more-contentious|title=The Search For Alien Life Is Getting Bigger, Weirder, And More Contentious|last=Bellis|first=Rich|date=2016-02-04|work=Fast Company|access-date=2017-04-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "a reflection of SETI growing up as a discipline."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Vakoch has argued for international consultation about transmission,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2010/01/25/how-to-talk-to-et.html|title=How to talk to ET|last=Pescovitz|first=David|date=2010-01-25|website=Boing Boing|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he suggests avoiding “either-or” thinking by continuing international discussions even after beginning to transmit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In an October 2015 letter in ''[[Nature Physics]]'', he advocated the use of scientific peer review to determine whether to schedule time for transmission projects at publicly supported observatories,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vakoch|first=Douglas A.|date=2016-10-01|title=In defence of METI|url=http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v12/n10/full/nphys3897.html|journal=Nature Physics|language=en|volume=12|issue=10|pages=890|doi=10.1038/nphys3897|issn=1745-2473|bibcode=2016NatPh..12..890V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2016/asimple-response-messages-aliens/|title=A not-so-simple response: Messages beamed to aliens amid debate over perils|last=Boyle|first=Alan|date=2016-10-10|work=GeekWire|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; a process that American astrobiologist [[Dirk Schulze-Makuch|Dirk Schulz-Makuch]] and ''Centauri Dreams''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Paul Gilster argue is inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/beaming-messages-other-stars-wise-idea-180960723/?no-ist|title=Is Beaming Messages to Other Stars a Wise Idea?|last=Schulze-Makuch|first=Dirk|date=2017-10-07|work=Air &amp; Space Magazine|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=36694|title=Freelancing an Interstellar Message|last=Gilster|first=Paul|date=2016-11-28|work=Centauri Dreams|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“It may be that signaling of our intention to make contact is what’s really required to trigger a response,” Vakoch told ''[[Business Insider]]'', adding that "the most critical reason to add Active SETI to our search strategy is that this may be the strategy that lets us make contact."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/should-we-actively-try-to-contact-aliens-2015-3|title=Serious talk about contacting aliens is sparking a fiery debate in the scientific community|last=Orwig|first=Jessica|date=2015-03-28|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that this initiative from humankind may be a prerequisite for making contact.

When astronomers announced in August 2016 the discovery of a potentially Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of the star nearest our solar system, [[Proxima Centauri]], Vakoch emphasized that if inhabited, the star's close proximity to Earth would allow a round trip exchange of messages with extraterrestrials in less than nine years, telling ''[[CNET]]'' "[w]e could have several back-and-forth exchanges with any civilizations there over the course of a human lifetime."&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/life-proxima-b-the-closest-earth-like-planet-in-the-universe/|title=Could life exist on Proxima b, the closest Earth-like planet in the universe?|last=Mack|first=Eric|date=2016-08-24|work=CNET|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; “[W]e could finally have something like a real conversation with an alien, with the usual give-and-take that happens when we meet a stranger,” Vakoch told [[Wired (magazine)|''WIRED'']], adding “In less than a decade, we could send a message and receive a reply from curious Centaurians.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/need-chill-proxima-centauri-b/|title=Y’all Need to Chill About Proxima Centauri b|last=Scoles|first=Sarah|date=2016-08-26|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vakoch responded to earlier theories that planets orbiting red dwarf stars like Proxima Centauri would not be suitable to sustain life because they would be tidally locked, with one side of the planet always facing the star and the other side facing away, meaning that "[o]ne side of the planet would be scorched, while the other side would be perpetually frozen."&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Vakoch argued that "new models of exoplanet atmospheres and oceans suggest that heat might be distributed around a tidally locked planet, leaving the door open for habitability. Even if the newly discovered exoplanet around Proxima Centauri is tidally locked, it could still be prime real estate for life."&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Nevertheless, Vakoch noted challenges to the habitability of this planet, saying "[t]he biggest downside of Proxima Centauri for alien hunters is that it's a flare star, dramatically and unpredictably varying in brightness over the course of a few minutes due to its magnetic activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/proxima-b-earth-exoplanet-cousin-discovery-centauri-space-life/|title=Found in space: Planet Proxima b could be Earth's closest cousin|last=Mack|first=Eric|date=2016-08-24|work=CNET|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vakoch made similar comments about the potential habitability of exoplanets orbiting another red dwarf star, [[TRAPPIST-1]], noting "[b]ecause these planets have an orbit so close to the TRAPPIST-1 star, they are thought to be subject to the phenomenon of synchronized rotation."&lt;ref name=":48"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ionline.sapo.pt/550616|title=Novo sistema planetário já tem site oficial (e posters)|last=Reis|first=Marta F.|date=2017-02-23|work=ionline|access-date=2017-04-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that heat might be transferred on tidally locked planets, drawing a parallel to Earth: "[w]hen the Sun sets at night on the Golden Gate Bridge, I do not worry that San Francisco Bay will freeze."&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt;

== Passive&lt;nowiki/&gt; SETI ==
In 2010, Vakoch was one of the leaders of Project Dorothy, a multinational effort launched by Japanese astronomer Shin-ya Narusawa to observe several stars for signals from other civilizations to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of [[Project Ozma]], the first modern-day [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI).&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/06/AR2010110604127.html?sid=ST2010110604135|title=Observatories on 5 continents to scan skies for extraterrestrial life|last=Kaufman|first=Marc|date=2010-11-07|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telling ''[[The Washington Post]]'' about the Project Dorothy observations, Vakoch said "[w]hat this weekend really does is begin the process of making it possible to track a possible SETI signal around the globe," and he added "[i]f a signal is detected, it has to be confirmed and followed, and now we're setting up a network to do that."&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

When a candidate SETI signal from the direction of the star [[HD 164595]] was first announced by Russian astronomers, Vakoch told ''[[CNN]]'' that "[t]he signal from HD 164595 is intriguing, because it comes from the vicinity of a sun-like star, and if it's artificial, its strength is great enough that it was clearly made by a civilization with capabilities beyond those of humankind."&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/30/health/seti-signal-hd-164595-alien-civilization/index.html|title=Can you hear me now?

Vakoch was not optimistic about detecting a signal from HD 164595 but he said that follow-up observations help prepare for detecting a real signal: “I think the likely outcome of this is that there’s no indication that it’s ET, but it provides a critical preparation for a day we may really discover intelligence out there,” he told ''[[New Scientist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2102970-mysterious-seti-signal-sends-alien-hunting-telescopes-scrambling/|title=Mysterious SETI signal sends alien-hunting telescopes scrambling|last=Hall|first=Shannon|date=2016-08-29|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vakoch argues that replication of a putative SETI signal is essential for confirmation, and the lack of such replication means that past signals such as the [[Wow! signal]] have little credibility.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/article1439767/Welche-Sprache-sprechen-Ausserirdische.html|title=Welche Sprache sprechen Außerirdische?|last=Marsiske|first=Hans-Arthur|date=2007-09-12|website=Die Welt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astrowatch.net/2015/07/we-could-find-aliens-any-day-now-seti.html|title=We Could Find Aliens Any Day Now: SETI Scientists Discuss Extraterrestrial Life Hunting|last=|first=|date=2015-07-09|website=www.astrowatch.net|publisher=Astrowatch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Without corroboration from an independent observatory, a putative signal from extraterrestrials doesn't have a lot of credibility," he told ''[[CNN]]''.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; He urged that HD 164595 should not be treated as a plausible candidate without further confirmation: “Assuming we don’t find any evidence of a transmitting civilization as we conduct follow-up observations, the worst outcome would be to turn HD 164595 into another Wow signal – seen once, never confirmed, but lurking in the imagination as perhaps really a message from another world. Unless we can observe another similar signal from the vicinity of this star, we need to dismiss the May 2015 signal as a spurious result, and not wishfully hope it was really from ET.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2016/still-no-aliens-lessons-learned-strange-radio-signal-seti-quest/|title=Still no aliens in the SETI quest: Lessons learned from that strange radio signal|last=Boyle|first=Alan|date=2016-08-30|work=GeekWire|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When two Canadian astronomers argued that they potentially discovered 234 extraterrestrial civilizations through analysis of the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] database, Vakoch doubted their explanation for their findings, noting that it would be unusual for all of these stars to pulse at exactly the same frequency unless they were part a coordinated network: “If you take a step back,” he said, “that would mean you have 234 independent stars that all decided to transmit the same way.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/22876-234-pulsing-stars-aren-t-aliens-still-mysterious|title=Those 234 Pulsing Stars Probably Aren’t Aliens, But They're Still a Complex Mystery|last=Patel|first=Neel V.|date=2016-10-28|work=Inverse|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The general mindset in SETI is that, before you say it’s an extraterrestrial intelligence, you have to think really creatively about what the natural explanations might be—and I think it’s way too early in the game to jump to the conclusion that it’s extraterrestrial intelligence,” Vakoch said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/87961/have-we-detected-hundreds-signals-extraterrestrial-life|title=Have We Detected Hundreds of Signals From Extraterrestrial Life?|last=Falk|first=Dan|date=2016-10-25|work=mental_floss|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When astronomers announced in January 2017 that the [[fast radio burst]] FRB 121102 comes from a [[dwarf galaxy]] almost three billion light years from Earth, Vakoch said that METI was using the Boquete Optical SETI Observatory in Panama to search for brief laser pulses from the same target. "I'm not holding my breath, and I'm not expecting to find any evidence of ET, but the follow-up is straightforward, so we'll make the observations out of due diligence," he told ''[[CNET]]'', adding "[s]o far we've found nothing that looks like the telltale sign of extraterrestrial technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/frb-121102-fast-radio-bursts-aliens-seti-meti-galaxy/|title=Scientists search for aliens in galaxy sending weird radio signals|last=Mack|first=Eric|date=2017-01-04|work=CNET|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the star Wolf 1061 was announced to be orbited by three "super-Earths," including Wolf 1061c that lies in the star's habitable zone, Vakoch reported that METI had on four separate occasions observed the star for brief laser pulses from its optical SETI observatory in Panama.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/scientists-are-checking-a-nearby-exoplanet-for-alien-transmissions/|title=Scientists are checking a nearby exoplanet for alien transmissions|last=Mack|first=Eric|date=2017-01-20|work=CNET|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he fact that there’s a roughly Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of a star so close to our own solar system is a good omen as we continue our search for life on other planets,” he told ''[[Gizmodo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/scientists-are-searching-for-life-on-this-nearby-exopla-1791442917|title=Scientists Are Searching For Life On This Nearby Exoplanet|last=Paoletta|first=Rae|date=2017-01-20|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So far, we've found no indications of advanced technologies in this promising exoplanet just 14 light-years from Earth," he said.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;

When unusual radio signals were reported in the vicinity of the red dwarf [[Ross 128]], Vakoch noted that this star had already been searched for brief laser pulses five times in the past from METI's optical SETI observatory in Panama, with no evidence of extraterrestrial technology detected. He observed that the signals detected from Ross 128 did not fit the expected profile of a radio signal from extraterrestrials, and the signals had not repeated, which is further reason not to treat these signals as credible evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/37516-strange-radio-signals-red-dwarf-star.html|title=Weird Radio Signals Detected from Nearby Red Dwarf Star|last=Wall|first=Mike|date=2017-07-17|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-02-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When China's [[Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope|Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope]] (FAST) went online, Vakoch told ''[[CNN]]'' that "China's latest telescope will be able to look faster and further than past searches for extraterrestrial intelligence."&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/health/china-fast-telescope-search-for-aliens/index.html|title=China's giant space telescope starts search for alien life|last=Hunt|first=Katie|date=2016-09-21|website=CNN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' that FAST is a “game-changer in the search for life in the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/24/a-game-changer-in-the-search-for-aliens-china-switches-on-worlds/|title=A ‘game-changer in the search for aliens’: China switches on world’s biggest telescope|last=Connor|first=Neil|date=2016-09-24|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; "FAST's innovative design and huge collecting area give it unsurpassed speed and sensitivity, making it vital to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence in the coming decades," Vakoch told [[Xinhua News Agency|''Xinhua'']], adding "[w]e can expect China to become a world leader in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence because of its demonstrated commitment in building FAST."&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-09/25/c_135712298.htm|title=China's giant telescope may lead to 'discoveries beyond wildest imagination': U.S. expert|last=|first=|date=2016-09-25|website=news.xinhuanet.com|publisher=Xinhua|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telescope will study the distribution of hydrogen to understand the origin of the universe, and Vakoch says that "[b]ecause of FAST's incredible sensitivity, it will be able to chart the hydrogen distribution even in far flung galaxies."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; He expected that FAST would lead to "a dramatic increase in the number and variety of pulsars discovered."&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; Vakoch also noted the limitations of the telescope, saying "FAST may help explain the origin of the universe and the structure of the cosmos, but it won't provide warning of Earth-bound asteroids that could destroy human civilization."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

When plans were announced to build the [[Qitai Radio Telescope]] (QTT), which would be the largest steerable radio telescope in the world, Vakoch noted its ability to pinpoint stars that are not accessible to FAST.&lt;ref name=":56"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/39508-china-worlds-largest-steerable-radio-telescope.html|title=China Plans to Build the World's Largest Steerable Radio Telescope|last=Atkinson|first=Nancy|date=2018-01-29|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-02-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted the QTT could support the search for extraterrestrial life by scanning interstellar space for complex organic molecules, as well as searching for narrowband techno-signatures indicative of extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;ref name=":56" /&gt; Because FAST and the QTT can both search within the "[[Water hole (radio)|water hole]]" that SETI scientists have long preferred, Vakoch told ''[[CNET]]'' that each observatory could confirm interesting signals detected by the other observatory within this frequency range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/radio-telescope-china-qtt-alien-signals/|title=New biggest radio telescope to help detect alien signals|last=Mack|first=Eric|date=2018-01-17|work=CNET|access-date=2018-02-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vakoch suggests that the detection of extraterrestrials in a standard SETI scenario may be less clear-cut than usually assumed: "I think the assumption that one day someone is going to announce that we’ve discovered extraterrestrial intelligence, and now the world knows, is a fallacy, because there’s going to be much more ambiguity in the process."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Folger|first=Tim|date=January 2011|title=Contact: The Day After|url=http://www.timfolger.net/seti.pdf|journal=Scientific American|volume=|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Unlike Hollywood movies, where you get a quick 'yes or no' about a possible signal from aliens,” Vakoch told ''[[Universe Today]]'', “the real SETI confirmation process takes some time. It’s easy to think that all we need to do is get on the phone with an astronomer at another location, and we’re all set. But even when colleagues at other facilities are willing to observe, they may face technical limitations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universetoday.com/130550/going-viral-alien-signals-get-everyone-excited/|title=Going Viral: Why Alien Signals Get Everyone Excited|last=Atkinson|first=Nancy|date=2016-08-31|work=Universe Today|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also assumes it may take some time to decode any message: "I don't think we're going to understand immediately what they have to say," he told ''[[ABC News]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=98628&amp;page=1|title=Waiting for Contact With Alien Life|last=Amos|first=Deborah|date=2001-04-23|website=ABC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; “There’s going to be a lot of guesswork in trying to interpret another civilization," he told ''[[Science Friday]]'', adding that "[i]n some ways, any message we get from an extraterrestrial will be like a cosmic [[Rorschach test|Rorschach ink blot test]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/what-happens-if-we-detect-extraterrestrial-intelligence/|title=What Happens if We Detect Extraterrestrial Intelligence?|last=Leibach|first=Julie|date=2016-11-30|work=Science Friday|access-date=2017-04-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vakoch contends that it is essential to expand an understanding of SETI beyond the technology needed to search by also re-examining assumptions about the nature of intelligence, which was the motivation for the METI workshop, “The Intelligence of SETI: Cognition and Communication in Extraterrestrial Intelligence,”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/conversing-et-180959306/|title=Conversing With E.T.|last=Schulze-Makuch|first=Dirk|date=2016-06-03|work=Air &amp; Space Magazine|access-date=2017-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; held in San Juan, Puerto Rico on May 18, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universetoday.com/129092/alien-minds-extraterrestrial-civilizations-likely/|title=Alien Minds I: Are Extraterrestrial Civilizations Likely to Evolve?|last=Patton|first=Paul|date=2016-05-24|work=Universe Today|access-date=2017-04-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; "By studying the variety of intelligence found on Earth," Vakoch said, "we can gain new insights into sending messages to life on other planets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/15804-how-do-we-talk-to-aliens-scientists-meet-in-puerto-rico-to-hash-it-out|title=How Do We Talk to Aliens?

== Space exploration ==
Vakoch has contributed to the study of space exploration, most notably through books examining psychological dimensions of space travel. [[The Journal of Military History|''The'' ''Journal of Military History'']] noted about Vakoch's edited book ''Psychology of Space Exploration: Contemporary Research in Historical Perspective'' that "[f]or those interested in an overview and synthesis of some of the key issues in the psychology of space exploration, this book provides a great introduction," adding that "[m]ost interestingly to those whose primary interest lies in history, many of the chapters engage the ''history of the psychology'' of space exploration quite well, most notably in the book’s first two chapters."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hansen|first=James R.|date=January 2012|title=Psychology of Space Exploration: Contemporary Research in Historical Perspective|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/70050833/psychology-space-exploration-contemporary-research-historical-perspective|journal=Journal of Military History|volume=76|issue=1|pages=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; ''[[Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine]]'' observed that "[t]his book is unique in that it places much of the ongoing research and interest in the topic of human behavior and performance in space in historical perspective" and concluded that "[i]t is certainly worthwhile reading for those directly involved in the next phase of human exploration of space as well as those who will witness this phase from the confines of Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palinkas|first=Lawrence A.|date=2012-07-01|title=Psychology of space exploration|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2012/00000083/00000007/art00015|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|volume=83|issue=7|pages=711|doi=10.3357/ASEM.3231.2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' wrote that "[t]his diverse and thought-provoking collection represents an important departure for the NASA History Series, a turn from works focused on machines, missions, and management structures to a concern with the smaller group of space sciences interested in human subjects, like space medicine and human factors engineering" and noted that the book "represents an important step in bringing the human-focused space sciences to the attention of a wider audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bimm|first=Jordan|date=2012-01-01|title=Review of Psychology of Space Exploration: Contemporary Research in Historical Perspective, Douglas&amp;#xa0;A.

''[[Journal of Mind and Behavior|The Journal of Mind and Behavior]]'' noted that Vakoch's follow-up book ''On Orbit and Beyond: Psychological Perspectives on Human Spaceflight'' includes several chapters that address the implications of the increased autonomy that astronauts would have on missions to Mars and Saturn, as compared to orbiting Earth or travelling to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=George|date=2013-01-01|title=Review of On Orbit and Beyond: Psychological Perspectives on Human Spaceflight|jstor=43854335|journal=The Journal of Mind and Behavior|volume=34|issue=2|pages=197–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; In an interview Vakoch explained the implications of this increased autonomy: "On missions to Mars, where greater autonomy will be expected of astronauts because of the greater distances, ground personnel should expect that their own roles will change over the course of the mission. Unless ground personnel are prepared, they may feel like they are no longer playing as central a role as they did shortly after liftoff because astronauts are now making more decisions."&lt;ref name=":54"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nightsky.ws/interview-with-prof-douglas-vakoch.html|title=Interview with Prof. Douglas Vakoch|last=Sanaee|first=Ehsan|date=|website=Nightsky|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vakoch explored the positive impact that space exploration can have on astronauts through the [[Overview effect|Overview Effect]]: "At its core, the Overview Effect is about gaining a new perspective about life on Earth, by viewing Earth from a distance. Having survived the flight into Earth orbit, contained in the artificial environment of a space capsule, astronauts look back to their home world with a sense of awe and wonder, appreciative of the fragility of their own planet."&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; He also drew parallels between the Overview Effect and the impacting of discovering extraterrestrial intelligence: "It has often been said that if we ever detect a signal from an extraterrestrial intelligence, letting us know that we are not the only intelligent species in the galaxy, then the differences across terrestrial cultures that seem so crucial today will seem much less important. The differences between Us and Them across cultures here on Earth will seem trivial, when we compare our human commonalities with a new alien Them that evolved independently on another world. The Overview Effect provides a similar sense of perspective for those astronauts who have been able to see Earth from a distance, where the boundaries that we draw on maps are invisible, seeming more like human-made constructions than inevitabilities."&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; "From space, those lines that separate nations are invisible," Vakoch told ''[[Forbes]]'', speaking of a photograph taken of Earth by astronaut [[William Anders]] during the [[Apollo 8]] mission, adding that "the [[Earthrise]] photo implies unity, one planet without boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billretherford/2018/03/07/new-doc-focuses-on-earthrise-photo-apollo-8-flight/|title=New Doc Focuses On Earthrise Photo, Apollo 8 Flight|last=Retherford|first=Bill|date=2018-03-07|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-03-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vakoch told ''[[Wired (magazine)|WIRED]]'' that today's astronauts need capacities that differ from the earliest astronauts: "Historically someone with the '[[The Right Stuff (film)|right stuff]]' was a tough, individualistic person who could explore an unknown frontier with great courage and certainty…. Now, you not only need to be a self-sufficient individual, you need to be able to work with astronauts from other cultures on the International Space Station.... If you’re an American astronaut, very often you’ll be working with people who don’t put as high an emphasis on individualism as the United States does. So, beyond the need for autonomy and independence, there is a greater need for interpersonal and intercultural sensitivity among astronauts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/07/psychology-right-stuff/|title=Spaceflight Psychology and the New ‘Right Stuff’|last=Venton|first=Danielle|date=2011-07-29|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-05-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In the early days of space exploration, it really was important to just have the 'right stuff.' If you don’t get along very well with people, you can suck it up for a couple weeks," he told ''Inverse'', adding "[b]ut when you’re talking about a mission that’s going to last for a year, and you don’t have a safe way to vent, that’s going to be a big problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/25720-nasa-hi-seas-mars-mission-colony-astronaut-the-right-stuff|title=Astronauts with People Skills Will Colonize Mars|last=Crosbie|first=Jack|date=2016-12-28|work=Inverse|access-date=2017-05-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The expectation that astronauts 'have the right stuff' is a big barrier," Vakoch told ''[[The Verge]]'', adding that "[t]hey don't want to admit faults, nor do they want to lose flight status."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/30/4377120/nasa-mars-psychology-wearable-sensors-astronauts|title=How to prevent an astronaut bloodbath on Mars|last=Drummond|first=Katie|date=2013-05-30|website=The Verge|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that astronauts on long-duration missions beyond Earth's orbit will face new challenges, telling ''NOW.SPACE'' that "there’s going to be a lot of boredom on a trip to Mars."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://now.space/posts/the-psychological-problems-of-spaceflight/|title=How Will We Deal With the Psychological Problems of Spaceflight?|last=Mann|first=Adam|date=2016-03-26|work=NOW.SPACE|access-date=2017-05-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Boredom and feeling separation from home will peak during the travel between Earth and Mars and back," he told ''Nightsky''.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Vakoch told ''[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]]'' that despite the challenges of boredom, "[t]he greatest advantage of having humans onboard a deep space mission is that we excel at dealing with the unpredictable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Sherry|date=Winter 2017|title=Doing Time on a Generation Starship|url=|journal=OMNI|volume=1|issue=74|pages=114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mars One]] plan to send settlers on a one-way mission adds additional stresses for astronauts, Vakoch told ''Discovery Channel Magazine'': "Mars One is revolutionary because it overcomes one of the greatest challenges faced by past missions planned for the Red Planet: getting back home safely," adding that "[a]stronauts usually have the comfort of knowing they can return to a safe, familiar environment. However difficult the mission is, there’s an end in sight. Not so for Mars One. By launching off to Mars, they’ll be making a commitment to an unknown way of life that they can never 'unchoose.'"&lt;ref name=":55"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docshare.tips/discovery-channel-magazine-india-april-2015_574e2005b6d87f3b438b5d15.html|title=The Mars March|last=Liu|first=Sarah|date=April 2015|website=Discovery Channel Magazine|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said there are analogues of people making one-way trips, though "[m]ost people can’t conceive of going on Mars One, because they can’t imagine leaving behind everything they love on Earth," adding that "[i]n reality, this is similar to the loss that all immigrants felt throughout the history of human migrations, whether they were forced to leave home or whether they left voluntarily."&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt;

At the 2008 annual convention of the [[American Psychological Association]], Vakoch chaired the symposium "To the Moon and Mars: Psychology of Long-Duration Space Exploration,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2008/08/space-flights.aspx|title=To the Moon and Mars: Psychologists Show New Ways to Combat Behavioral Health Challenges During Long Space Flights|last=|first=|date=2008-08-14|website=American Psychological Association|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was identified as a "highlight" of the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2008/05/convention.aspx|title=American Psychological Association 116th Annual Convention in Boston|last=|first=|date=2008-05-12|website=American Psychological Association|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vakoch has also examined unmanned space exploration. Commenting on plans to send miniature spacecraft to a nearby star, he told the ''[[International Business Times]]'' that "[b]y sending hundreds or thousands of space probes the size of postage stamps, [[Breakthrough Initiatives|Breakthrough Starshot]] gets around the hazards of spaceflight that could easily end a mission relying on a single spacecraft. Only one nanocraft needs to make its way to [[Alpha Centauri]] and send back a signal for the mission to be successful. When that happens, Starshot will make history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/alpha-centauri-mission-stephen-hawking-yuri-milner-plan-send-tiny-spacecrafts-stars-1554511|title=Alpha Centauri mission: Stephen Hawking and Yuri Milner plan to send tiny spacecrafts to the stars|last=Osborne|first=Hannah|date=2016-04-12|work=International Business Times UK|access-date=2017-05-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing within the solar system, he commented on NASA's plans to send a lander to Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], telling ''[[Gizmodo]]'' that "[t]he top priority of this lander mission will be to search for evidence of life on Europa," adding that "even if that main goal isn’t met, we will learn a great deal about the potential habitability of this icy moon, which will be essential for future, even more ambitious missions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/nasa-plans-to-drill-toward-europas-ocean-in-search-of-l-1792233535|title=NASA Plans to Drill Into Europa's Crust In Search of Life|last=Paoletta|first=Rae|date=2017-02-10|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2017-05-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with the annual convention of the [[American Psychological Association]] in 2008, Vakoch assessed people's responses to environmental problems.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/environment/2008-08-13-green-psychology_N.htm|title=Psychologists determine what it means to think 'green'|last=Jayson|first=Sharon|date=2008-08-14|work=USA Today|access-date=2017-04-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I think most people recognize we face a severe environmental crisis, but it's hard to deal with that head-on because most people feel helpless to do anything about it," he told ''[[USA Today]]'', adding "[i]f we look at the nature of the problem, it is so big it's hard to know what any individual can do in their own life to make a difference."&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Vakoch called for additional research into the psychology of environmental issues, saying "[w]e are recognizing that environmental problems have a tremendous impact on many aspects of our lives, but we need a lot more work."&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; He cautioned that "[w]e can't afford to let this increased environmental concern become just another fashionable trend."&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

"Psychologists are increasingly becoming involved in helping alleviate environmental problems," Vakoch told [[CQ Press|''CQ Researcher'']], adding that "[p]sychologists are very experienced in dealing with denial and in helping to frame messages in ways that people can hear the bad news without being paralyzed by it."&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Billitteri|first=Thomas J.|date=December 5, 2008|title=Reducing Your Carbon Footprint|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2008120500|journal=CQ Researcher by CQ Press|language=en|volume=18|issue=42|pages=985–1008|issn=1942-5635|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The most important lesson . . . is that there is no 'one size fits all' solution to environmental problems," Vakoch said, adding "[t]o create effective public policies, leaders need to recognize that different people are willing to adopt more environmentally sound behaviors for different reasons. What's compelling for one person will fail for another."&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

''[[PsycCRITIQUES]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s review of Vakoch and Fernando Castrillón's ''Ecopsychology, Phenomenology, and the Environment''&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; observes that "[a]lthough ecopsychological phenomenology’s lack of shrillness is refreshing and laudable for the intrinsic human values it promotes, the book’s strengths contain its vulnerability. We ''have'' reached some critical tipping points, and we cannot continue with business as usual. The authors in ''Ecopsychology, Phenomenology, and the Environment'' are well aware of this. Rather than making dire warnings, they ask the big questions."&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landon|first=Barbara|date=November 10, 2014|title=Husserl's Remedy: Phenomenology, Ethics, and the Call of the Wild|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2014-37030-001|journal=PsycCRITIQUES|volume=59|issue=45|pages=Article 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reviewer noted that "[w]hat I liked least about ''Ecopsychology, Phenomenology, and the Environment'' is that all of its authors are North Americans or people living in North America" and "[w]hat I liked most about it, apart from some really beautiful writing, is its mature approach to suffering and the wildness of our nature, as part of the great chain of being. There is a cogent argument that we must address our sense of separateness from the world that holds us. I believe that readers will come away with an expanded sense of identity, and with a sense of calmness about what can be done and how one might go about contributing."&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt;

Vakoch's books in ecofeminism have been widely reviewed in scholarly journals. The review journal ''Choice'' recommended Vakoch's ''Feminist Ecocriticism''&lt;ref name=":46" /&gt; for “[u]pper-division undergraduates through faculty,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Utell|first=J. M.|date=February 2013|title=Feminist Ecocriticism: Environment, Women, and Literature|url=|journal=Choice|volume=50|issue=6|pages=1048}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Environmental Philosophy (journal)|Environmental Philosophy]]'' called it "an excellent contribution of Post-structuralist Ecofeminist thought on the contemporary liberatory alternatives debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Isla|first=Ana|date=2013|title=Feminist Ecocriticism: Environment, Women, and Literature|url=|journal=Environmental Philosophy|volume=10|issue=1|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[English Studies (journal)|English Studies]]'' noted that "[u]nfortunately, ''Feminist Ecocriticism'' presents a slightly anachronistic view of ecofeminism, and fails to take into account the many exciting developments taking place in the field since 2000, such as material feminism"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bracke|first=Astrid|date=2015-05-19|title=Feminist Ecocriticism: Women, Environment, and Literature|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0013838X.2014.998042|journal=English Studies|volume=96|issue=4|pages=483|doi=10.1080/0013838X.2014.998042|issn=0013-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[t]he collection's main flaw is that the essays rarely, if at all, reference scholarly work published since the turn of the century,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bracke|first=Astrid|date=2015-05-19|title=Feminist Ecocriticism: Women, Environment, and Literature|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0013838X.2014.998042|journal=English Studies|volume=96|issue=4|pages=484|doi=10.1080/0013838X.2014.998042|issn=0013-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt; while "the biggest contribution it makes, which is certainly not unimportant, is to the study of individual works, most notably [[Rachel Carson|Carson]]'s sea books (Sullivan) and ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (Magee)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bracke|first=Astrid|date=2015-05-19|title=Feminist Ecocriticism: Women, Environment, and Literature|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0013838X.2014.998042|journal=English Studies|volume=96|issue=4|pages=484–485|doi=10.1080/0013838X.2014.998042|issn=0013-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reviewer of Vakoch's ''Ecofeminism and Rhetoric''&lt;ref name=":47" /&gt; for the journal ''Women &amp; Language'' noted that "[t]he material is challenging—in terms of its challenge to popular thinking and conventional scholarship—and, yes, even troubling. However, the authors' reflection on their own work and the frames offered at the beginning and the end of the book provide useful ways of processing the theories and examples, making this is a book to which I will return. ''Ecofeminism and Rhetoric'' provides a strong overview of the field, news ways of operationalizing ecofeminist theory, and an awareness of possible problems with ecofeminism and answers to those critiques."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Senda-Cook|first=Samantha|date=Spring 2012|title=Ecofeminism and Rhetoric: Critical Perspectives on Sex, Technology, and Discourse|url=|journal=Women &amp; Language|volume=35|issue=1|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same reviewer wrote that "[b]ecause ''Ecofeminism and Rhetoric'' provides a strong overview of the field, proffering both classic and innovative ecofeminist critiques, it is appropriate for a variety of audiences ranging from the seasoned ecofeminist to one who has just discover ecofeminism. Additionally, reading the epilogue first will help the selective reader choose how to prioritize the chapters. I will use this book again in projects outside of ecofeminism because the lens is well cultivated and the meta-conversation insightful."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Senda-Cook|first=Samantha|date=Spring 2012|title=Ecofeminism and Rhetoric: Critical Perspectives on Sex, Technology, and Discourse|url=|journal=Women &amp; Language|volume=35|issue=1|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The'' ''Journal of Ecocriticism'' said of the same book "[i]n many ways, ''Ecofeminism and Rhetoric'' continues the shift toward an interdisciplinary approach in academic publishing. Relevant to many academics, its clear prose, recognizable ecologies, and varied topics attract readers from English departments to the Biological sciences. Undoubtedly, versatility and applicability of Vakoch’s essay collection should not be overlooked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Taylor|date=January 2013|title=Ecofeminism and Rhetoric: Critical Perspectives on Sex, Technology, and Discourse|url=https://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/joe/article/download/446/410|journal=The Journal of Ecocriticism|volume=5|issue=1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Gender, Place &amp; Culture: A Journal of Feminist Geography|Gender, Place &amp; Culture]]'' commended "the collection on its ambitious scope" and suggested that "research students and academics will enjoy reading it, and undergraduate students may benefit from the overview chapters that frame the theoretical approaches therein."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLean|first=Jessica|date=2015-04-21|title=Ecofeminism and rhetoric: critical perspectives on sex, technology, and discourse|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0966369X.2014.977527|journal=Gender, Place &amp; Culture|volume=22|issue=4|pages=581|doi=10.1080/0966369X.2014.977527|issn=0966-369X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Anthropological Forum'' said "''Ecofeminism and Rhetoric'' is a worthwhile contribution which will be valuable for undergraduates and researchers both within and outside the academic field of ecofeminism.

Not only does it venture into relatively uncharted territory, it also proposes to bring together three fields that all have distinct identities and a large specialized literature: feminism, environmental studies, and rhetoric. The temptation in any analysis of this kind is to focus on one of the three areas at the expense of the others rather than to achieve an effective synthesizing vision. While this collection of essays does an admirable job of opening the topic of ecofeminist rhetoric to further inquiry, it does not achieve the synthesizing vision except in rare moments. What suffers most in the mix is rhetorical scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killingsworth|first=M.

Vakoch's edited volumes in ecofeminism have been criticized for not including adequate multicultural representation among the contributors and perspectives.&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ngobeni|first=Amukelani T.|date=2013-01-01|title=Book Review: Feminist Ecocriticism: Environment, Women, Literature|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/jiws/vol14/iss3/26|journal=Journal of International Women's Studies|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=310–311|issn=1539-8706}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer questioned a volume on ecofeminism that includes so many male contributors.&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt;

'''Ekplexite''' is a unique [[sulfide]]-[[hydroxide]] [[niobium]]-rich mineral with the formula (Nb,Mo)S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;•(Mg&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2+x&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=P&gt;Pekov., I.V., Yapaskurt, V.O., Polekhovsky, Y.S., Vigasina, M.F., and Siidra, O.I., 2014. Ekplexite (Nb,Mo)S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·(Mg&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2+x&lt;/sub&gt;, kaskasite (Mo,Nb)S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·(Mg&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2+x&lt;/sub&gt; and manganokaskasite (Mo,Nb)S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·(Mn&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2+x&lt;/sub&gt;, three new valleriite-group mineral species from the Khibiny alkaline complex, Kola peninsula, Russia. Mineralogical Magazine 78(3), 663-679.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-42864.html |title=Ekplexite: Ekplexite mineral information and data |website=Mindat.org |accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unique because [[niobium]] is usually found in [[oxide]] or, eventually, [[silicate]] minerals. Ekplexite is a case in which [[chalcophile]] behaviour of niobium is shown, which means niobium present in a sulfide mineral. The unique combination of elements in ekplexite has to do with its name, which comes from a Greek world on "surprise".&lt;ref name=P&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; The other example of chalcophile behaviour of niobium is edgarite, FeNb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and both minerals were found in the same environment, which is a fenitic rock of Mt. Kaskasnyunchorr, [[Khibiny Massif]], [[Kola Peninsula]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-6910.html |title=Edgarite: Edgarite mineral information and data |website=Mindat.org |accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the same rock has revealed the presence of two analogues of ekplexite, [[kaskasite]] ([[molybdenum]]-analogue) and [[manganokaskasite]] ([[molybdenum]]- and [[manganese]]-analogue). All three minerals belong to the valleriite group, and crystallize in the [[trigonal]] system with similar possible space groups.&lt;ref&gt;Pekov., I.V., Yapaskurt, V.O., Polekhovsky, Y.S., Vigasina, M.F., and Siidra, O.I., 2014. Ekplexite (Nb,Mo)S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·(Mg&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2+x&lt;/sub&gt;, kaskasite (Mo,Nb)S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·(Mg&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2+x&lt;/sub&gt; and manganokaskasite (Mo,Nb)S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·(Mn&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2+x&lt;/sub&gt;, three new valleriite-group mineral species from the Khibiny alkaline complex, Kola peninsula, Russia. Mineralogical Magazine 78(3), 663-679&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

==Notes on chemistry==
Beside [[niobium]], [[molybdenum]], [[sulfur]], [[magnesium]] and [[aluminium]] ekplexite contains also relatively small amounts of [[tungsten]], [[vanadium]] and [[iron]].&lt;ref name=P&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association and environment==
The rock in which contains ekplexite is classified as [[fenite]]. In this rock ekplexite associates with [[fluorophlogopite]], [[nepheline]], [[orthoclase]]-[[anorthoclasee]] (silicates), [[alabandine]], edgarite, [[pyrite]], [[molybdenite]], [[tungstenite]] (sulfides), corundum, graphite and monazite-(Ce).&lt;ref name=P&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crystal structure==
Crystal structure of ekplexite is described as non-commensurate. It is composed of two modules:&lt;ref name=P&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Me''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sulfide module
* brucite-like (hydroxide) module

He is a contributor to the ''Counterterrorism Blog'', a senior investigator with [[The Nine Eleven Finding Answers Foundation]], and a terrorism analyst for ''[[NBC News]]''.&lt;ref name=CTCSentinel/&gt;

In his manifesto [[Anders Behring Breivik]] copied 25 pages verbatim from an ideological text by Evan Kohlmann and published by an institute led by [[Magnus Ranstorp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fria.nu/artikel/89268|title="Flat granskning av Breiviks bakgrund" ("Lenient scrutiny of Breivik's background")|work=Fria.Nu|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
In the profile for the ''Penn Law Journal'', Kohlmann said he spent summers in France while growing up, because his father studied there.  Kohlmann graduated from [[Pine Crest School]] in [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]].

He attended the [[Georgetown University]] [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]], where he studied under [[Mamoun Fandy]].&lt;ref name=PennLawJournalFall2006/&gt;  Fandy's mentorship sparked his interest in Middle East politics.  "When [Fandy] lived in Egypt, he passed by the number two guy in [[al-Qaeda]] there every day. He really knew his subject."

Kohlmann entered the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]] in the fall of 2001, a few weeks before al-Qaeda's attacks on the U.S. on September 11, 2001.&lt;ref name=PennLawJournalFall2006/&gt;

==Counter-terrorism career==
Kohlmann worked as an intern at [[The Investigative Project]], a Washington, DC, counter-terrorism [[think-tank]].&lt;ref name=PennLawJournalFall2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19iCbNOoYmIC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=%22Evan+Kohlmann%22&amp;num=100&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Evan%20Kohlmann%22&amp;f=false |title='&amp;#39;Terror on the Internet: the new arena, the new challenges'&amp;#39;, Gabriel Weimann, US Institute of Peace Press, 2006, ISBN 1-929223-71-4, accessed February 8, 2010 |publisher= |date=September 11, 2001 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has called [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] "one of the principal ''jihadi'' luminaries for would-be homegrown terrorists. His fluency with English, his unabashed advocacy of ''jihad'' and ''[[mujahideen]]'' organizations, and his Web-savvy approach are a powerful combination." He calls al-Awlaki's lecture "Constants on the Path of Jihad", which he says was based on a similar document written by al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia's founder, the "virtual bible for lone-wolf Muslim extremists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-fort-hood-probe9-2009nov09,0,5487900.story |last=Meyer|first= Josh|title=Fort Hood shooting suspect's ties to mosque investigated|date=November 9, 2009|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

which was sponsored by the [[Office of Military Commissions]]. According to [[Carol Rosenberg]] of the ''[[Miami Herald]]'':  "He modeled the video after The Nazi Plan, an instructional movie shown at the late 1940s Nuremberg tribunals for the most senior Nazi leadership."

Initially [[Captain (USN)|Captain]] [[Keith J. Allred|Keith Allred]], the President of [[Salim Ahmed Hamdan]]'s Military Commission ruled that the film would be prejudicial, but he reversed this decision.&lt;ref name=AssociatedPress20080728/&gt;

His expertise and neutrality have been disputed by defense attorneys and other experts, while his book ″Al-Qaida’s Jihad in Europe: The Afghan-Bosnian Network″ was declined by University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;ref&gt;https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/07/27/doogie-huckster-terrorism-experts-secret-relationship-fbi/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fluid mechanics]], '''external flow''' is such a flow that [[boundary layer]]s develop freely, without constraints imposed by adjacent surfaces. Accordingly, there will always exist a region of the flow outside the boundary layer in which velocity, temperature, and/or [[concentration gradient]]s are negligible. It can be defined as the flow of a fluid around a body that is completely submerged in it.

An example includes fluid motion over a flat plate (inclined or parallel to the free stream velocity) and flow over curved surfaces such as a sphere, cylinder, [[airfoil]], or [[turbine blade]], air flowing around an airplane and water flowing around the submarines.

{{merge from|Field (Bourdieu)|date=February 2018}}

In [[sociology]], '''field theory''' examines how [[individuals]] construct social fields, and how they are affected by such fields. Social fields are [[Social environment|environments]] in which [[competition]] between individuals and between [[Social groups|groups]] takes place, such as [[markets]], [[academic disciplines]], [[musical genres]], etc.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marquis|first=Christopher|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|date=2016-10-01|title=Institutional Equivalence: How Industry and Community Peers Influence Corporate Philanthropy|journal=Organization Science|volume=27|issue=5|pages=1325–1341|doi=10.1287/orsc.2016.1083|issn=1047-7039|hdl=1813/44734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unstable fields are defined by rapid change and frequently by destructive forms of competition, such as pure competition over prices that drives [[profit margins]] to untenably low levels.  Fields thus need to be stabilized with rules which make sure that competition takes non-destructive forms. Stable fields rarely emerge on their own, but must be constructed by skilled [[entrepreneurs]].&lt;ref name="Fligstein2001"/&gt;  The [[government]] frequently plays a role in this process as well.&lt;ref name="Fligstein2001"&gt;[[Fligstein, Neil]].  2001.  "Social Skill and the Theory of Fields."  ''Sociological Theory'', vol. 19:2&lt;/ref&gt;

Fields feature different positions which [[social actor]] can occupy. The dominant players in the field are called the ''incumbents''.  They are generally invested in maintaining the field in its current form, as changes to the rules of competition risk destabilizing their dominant position.&lt;ref name="Cattani2014"&gt;Cattani, Gino, Ferriani, Simone, and Allison, Paul. 2014. "Insiders, Outsiders and the Struggle for Consecration in Cultural Fields: A Core-Periphery Perspective." ''American Sociological Review'', vol.78(3): pp.417-447.[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByE7rCUuloTlZm9LLW9adXRXMFE/edit?usp=sharing]&lt;/ref&gt;  Fields may also feature ''insurgents'' who instead aim to alter the field so they can successfully compete with the incumbents.&lt;ref name="Fligstein2001"/&gt;  Dramatic change in previously stable fields can come from either successful incumbents or intrusion from other fields, or from government-imposed rule change.

In general, different field positions create different incentives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Field position is experienced by individuals in the form of [[motivation]].&lt;ref name="Martin2003"&gt;Martin, John Levi. 2003. "What is Field Theory?"  ''American Journal of Sociology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frances 'Poppy' Northcutt''' (August 10, 1943-) is a Texas attorney who notably began her career as a '[[human computer|computress]]' and then an engineer for the technical staff on NASA's [[Apollo Program]] during the [[space race]]. She was the first female engineer to work in NASA's [[mission control center|Mission Control]] during [[Apollo 8]].&lt;ref name="Barteski"&gt;{{cite AV media|title=MAKERS Women in Space|date=2014|people=Barteski, Ed (Editor)|publisher=Kunhardt McGee Productions|location=Washington D.C.|medium=Motion picture}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Orwig&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/poppy-northcutt-helped-apollo-astronauts-2014-12?op=1|title=This Amazing 25-Year-Old Woman Helped Bring Apollo Astronauts Back From The Moon - Business Insider|date=9 December 2014|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lunar crater Poppy in her honor for her work and pioneering in the Apollo Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turnill |first=Reginald |date=January 18, 2007 |title=The Moonlandings: An Eyewitness Account |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=365 |isbn=978-0521035354 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 26, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Later in her career, Northcutt became an attorney specializing in women's rights. In the early 1970s, she served on the national Board of Directors of the [[National Organization for Women]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Cristan|title=NOW state rep talks with the TransAdvocate about TERFs, trans-inclusion and civil rights |url=http://www.transadvocate.com/now-state-rep-talks-with-the-transadvocate-about-terfs-trans-inclusion-and-civil-rights_n_13530.htm#sthash.Uu23xjjH.dpuf|accessdate=2 August 2015|publisher=The TransAdvocate|date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Life ==
Frances "Poppy" Northcutt was born in [[Many, Louisiana|Manny, Louisiana]] on August 10, 1943. She grew up in [[Luling, Texas]] and then moved to [[Dayton, Texas]]. Northcutt attended high school at [[Dayton High School (Texas)|Dayton High School in Liberty County]] and then went on to study [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]]. &lt;ref name=Ely&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.houstonlibrary.org/oral-history/frances-northcutt.php|title=Frances Northcutt - Houston Public Library Digital Archives|last=Ely|first=Jane|date=3 April 2008|work=Houston Public Library|access-date=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
===Engineering for the Apollo Program===
After graduating in three and a half years, Northcutt was hired in 1965 by [[TRW Inc.|TRW]], an aerospace contractor with [[NASA]], as a computer for the new [[Apollo program]]. She was soon promoted to engineer stationed in the Mission Control's Mission Planning and Analysis room. She was the first female engineer to work as part of NASA's Mission Control. 

Northcutt and her team designed the return-to-Earth trajectory that the [[Apollo 8]] crew took from the moon back to Earth. She made key insights that identified mistakes in the plan before they were executed.&lt;ref name="Barteski" /&gt; If there was any delay in swinging around the moon resulting in using up more fuel than planned it was up to Northcutt and her team to make on-the-spot calculations and changes to the plan to ensure the astronauts' safe return. Apollo 8 was the second crewed spacecraft for the United States and became the first crewed mission to ever leave orbit. It successfully reached the Earth's [[moon]], orbited it and then returned to Earth safely on December 27,1968.  &lt;ref name="Orwig"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/poppy-northcutt-helped-apollo-astronauts-2014-12?op=1|title=This Amazing 25-Year-Old Woman Helped Bring Apollo Astronauts Back From The Moon - Business Insider|date=9 December 2014|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Turnill |first=Reginald |date=January 18, 2007 |title=The Moonlandings: An Eyewitness Account |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=365 |isbn=978-0521035354 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 26, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rissman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rissman |first=Rebecca |publisher=Capstone Press |date=2018 |title=Houston, We've Had a Problem: The Story of the Apollo 13 Disaster}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Northcutt continued working with TRW and NASA for several more years working as a critical component of some of NASA's most historic missions such as [[Apollo 13]]. After learning about the exploded oxygen tank on the Apollo 13 mission, Northcutt and the other engineers who developed the computer program for Apollo 13 to get home immediately came in to find a way to get the astronauts home safely. &lt;ref name="Barteski" /&gt; Her program that she worked on was used to compute the maneuvers to come home. Northcutt and the Mission Operations Team were later awarded the [[Apollo 13 Mission Operations Team|Presidential Medal of Freedom Team Award]] for finding a way to safely return Apollo 13. [[Apollo 17]], the last mission to the moon, landed next to "Crater Poppy", a crater named in Northcutt's honor for her work as one of the early pioneers in the Apollo program.&lt;ref name="Orwig" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rissman" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Fighting for the Women's Rights Movement===
As one of few women working in engineering, Northcutt became increasing involved in the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation movement]]. She helped put on demonstrations, strikes, speeches, press releases and whatever she could to help the cause with the National Organization for Women. &lt;ref name=Rissman /&gt;She spoke at [[Houston City Council|City Council]] many times and in 1974, the mayor of [[Houston, TX]] named her the first Women's Advocate for the City. In this position she passed a great deal of legislation passed improving the status of women. She negotiated an agreement with the [[Houston Police Department|Police Chief]] enabling women to become cops. She got the [[Houston Fire Department|Fire Department]] to agree to let women in. She led a big equal pay study going through the entire payroll. She was so dedicated to improving equality that she counted every women's versus men's bathroom in all of Houston helping bring even this number to parity. 

Northcutt helped drastically increase the number of women that were on appointed boards and commissions. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She helped pass a law that no longer allowed hospitals to charge women who came in for a rape kit. Later on, Northcutt would become President of both the Houston and entire Texas chapter for the [[National Organization for Women|National Organization of Women]]. &lt;ref name="Orwig" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During this time, Northcutt was still employed by TRW, receiving a partial salary as she was on loan. When her loan expired she went back to TRW for a while. However, she believed "if you were doing your job, you should do yourself out of a job" and thus went to [[Merrill Lynch]], a stockbroker firm for a year. Northcutt then switched into the [[TRW Inc.|TRW Controls]] division and during this time attended law school at night. In 1984, Northcutt graduated [[Summa Cum Laude|summa cum laude]] from the [[University of Houston Law Center]] becoming a [[criminal defense lawyer]]. Northcutt practiced law for the rest of her life with special emphasis and dedication to her fight for [[civil rights]]. &lt;ref name="Ely" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7086">The '''Global Challenge Award''' is an online science and engineering design program for pre-college school students (e.g. middle school through high school) from all over the world. It is an initiative that started with a partnership with the [[University of Vermont]] in collaboration with the [[National Science Foundation]], currently funded by the MacArthur Foundation Digital Media and Learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmlcompetition.net/|title=Digital Media and Learning Competition 6|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; program as well as other foundations and corporations, wherein students have the opportunity to form teams with international counterparts and work towards a solution to mitigate [[global warming]] and help envision the future of [[renewable energy]]. The program is an online educational environment that uses [[game based learning]], [[simulation]] and Web-based science resources in a global competition. It relies on the personal initiative and creativity of students working in diverse teams. The access to the project via the Web makes it possible for students, parents, [[homeschooling]] families, teachers and interested global community members to get involved to help young people with their creative ideas for innovation in new forms of energy, conservation and increased productivity.

==History==
Founded in 2005 by Craig Deluca and David Rocchio of the Arno Group and Biddle Duke, the publisher of the Stowe Reporter newspaper company in Stowe, Vt., working in close partnership with Domenico Grasso of [[The University of Vermont]] (see) College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/|title=CEMS Home : University of Vermont|first=University of|last=Vermont|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the program gives international student teams the opportunity to experience the excitement of scientific understanding and engineering design while working on significant human and societal issues – bringing science to life in innovative new applications. The program mission is to "give students the tools and confidence to solve global problems together."

The overarching model for the learning experiences offered worldwide to any student was influenced by  The George Lucas Foundation's Big ideas For Better Schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/big-ideas|title=Big Ideas for Better Schools: Ten Ways to Improve Education|first=|last=Edutopia|date=11 August 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Partnership for 21st Century Schools&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/ Partnership for 21st Century Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306025420/http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/ |date=2010-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[game based learning]].  The Global Challenge was funded in part by a [[National Science Foundation]] award from the [[Innovative Technology Experiences for Students]] (ITEST) program, validating the project's design for engaging youth in science, technology, engineering and mathematics learning.

Since its founding in 2005, The Global Challenge has reached over 100,000 people worldwide and engaged over 4,000 students from 60 countries in forming teams to solve the challenge. About $200,000 in scholarships, travel, summer study have been provided to over 200 students from 10 countries.

==International connections==
The Global Challenge Award is responsible for identification of high school students who represent the United States in the [[International Earth Science Olympiad]] or IESO. Students and teachers travel to South Korea in 2007 and the Philippines in 2008. Plans are now underway to form a US-IESO selection process with the support of the American Geological Institute.

In addition, the design of the program builds international student teams. Students from over 79 countries participate each year. Top countries by participation with over 100 students each year have been the United States, India, China, and South Korea.

==Program elements==

There are several project areas in the Challenge. Some are designed specifically for teams, others students can work on alone. Students can mix and match projects based on their interest level and time. They can form a team to compete in one competition and, at the same time, work on individual points.

* ''Global Business Plan'' Students build an international team, envision a global solution, create a detailed [[business plan]], and submit it for judging.
* ''Technical Innovation Plan'' Students build an international team, envision any kind of technical solution, explain it to a panel of judges.
* ''Explorations'' Students work on their own on science, technology, engineering and mathematics units of study called "challenges."
* ''Green Earth Corps'' Students work on their own or with any team, build a home and business auditing service, earn while they learn and serve.
* ''GCA-350'' Students create an awareness event about the need to reach "350 parts per million" of [[CO2 emissions|CO2 in the atmosphere]].

Each Challenge earns certain points, and in the end, teams with the highest scores win and earn scholarships, travel awards to the Governor's Institute on Engineering in Vermont, cash prizes, and tuition scholarships.

==News coverage==

The program was the lead story "Save the World" in Learning &amp; Leading with Technology November 2007. In the Burlington Free Press in July 2008, and has led to a number of youth-authored articles on Cogito.org, for example: Using Nanotechnology for Cost Effective Converters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogito.org/Articles/ArticleDetail.aspx?ContentID=17460|title=Using Nanotechnology for Cost-Effective Catalytic Converters

'''HCG 87''' is a compact [[group of galaxies]] listed in the [[Hickson Compact Group]] Catalogue.  This group is about [[1 E24 m|400 million]] [[light-year]]s away &lt;ref&gt;[http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/31/hicktable.ps This redshift corresponds to a distance of 120Mpc or 400 million light years (using H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 75km/s/Mpc and q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1). At the distance of the group, this corresponds to a group diameter of 52kpc, i.e., the group is approximately 170,000 light years across.]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[constellation]] [[Capricornus]]. 
The group distinguishes itself as one of the most compact groups of galaxies, hosting two [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] and a starburst among its three members, all of which show signs of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Keith. 07/1999.

Williams et al., Soil Sci Soc Am J 71:735-744 (2007){{cite web |url=http://soil.scijournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/3/735 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621041817/http://soil.scijournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/3/735 |archivedate=2008-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitrogen is essential for plant development. Indeed, for crops that are destined to be food for farm animal or human consumption, incorporation of nitrogen into the crop is an important goal, since this forms the basis for [[protein]] in the human diet.

Nitrogen is commonly present in soils in many forms, and there are many ways to measure this nitrogen. None of these are completely satisfactory as a measure of the nitrogen that is available for use by crops. The ISNT is a new (2007) method for measuring nitrogen available for plant uptake.

ISNT estimates the amount of nitrogen present in the soil as [[amigo acid|amino]] [[carbohydrate|sugar]] nitrogen. With respect to [[maize|corn]] and [[soybean]]s, the optimal range for plant growth appears to be around 225 to 240&amp;nbsp;mg/Kg. Some form of nitrogen [[fertilizer]] is needed if levels are below this range. On the other hand, if levels are above this range, addition of nitrogen fertilizer will not increase crop yield.

In the [[corn belt]], since about 1975, the predominant method of estimating the amount of nitrogen needed for corn has been the "yield-based" method. A farmer first estimates the yield of corn he intends to produce. He then applies 1.1 to 1.4&amp;nbsp;lbs of nitrogen per bushel of expected yield.&lt;ref&gt;Need for a Soil-Based Approach in Managing Nitrogen Fertilizers for Profitable Corn Production, R.L. Mulvaney, S.A. Khan, T.R. Ellsworth, Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 70:172-182 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; ISNT represents an alternative approach to managing nitrogen application. However, ISNT does not offer a simple answer as to the amount of nitrogen fertilizer that is needed, or as to the optimal form of that fertilizer. 

In field trials in Illinois, some fields have been found to be under-fertilized when managed according to the "yield-based" method, as judged by the ISNT. In the majority of trials, however, the yield-based method calls for the addition of nitrogen far in excess of the levels needed for optimal crop production. This nitrogen, which is applied by farmers at great cost, does not find its way into the crop, but is lost to the atmosphere or leaches into waterways.

Within the corn belt, stalks and other crop residues are left in the field with the intention of enhancing the amount of organic material in the soil. Excessive nitrogen application, however, appears to promote the rapid decomposition of organic matter in the soil, resulting in release of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;The Myth of Nitrogen Fertilization for Soil Carbon Sequestration, S.A. Khan, R.L. Mulvaney et al., J. Environ. Qual. 36:1821-1832 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the amount of organic material in soils managed according to the yield-based method in the corn belt appears to be decreasing in spite of the large amounts of crop residues left in the fields.

'''Industrial deconcentration''' is the movement of industrial zones ([[Factory|factories]]) away from the center of the [[city]], and further away from each other. It is similar to [[suburb]]anization, a residential trend in which a large number of the population move away from the [[metropolis]] as the [[inner city]] becomes overcrowded.

Industrial deconcentration occurs when a previously established [[industrial district]] becomes unable to provide efficiently for its own populace due to overcrowding.  In a [[market economy]] the massive [[competition]] and overcrowding of the metropolitan area forces people and businesses to move out to less-industrial areas with less [[traffic congestion]].  Modernization in the social, economic, and technological fields of a country is a factor in accelerating industrial deconcentration.

This phenomenon is more apparent in nations that have been industrialized for a longer time.  Most countries experiencing industrial deconcentration at the beginning of the 21st century are the states that began industrializing after the end of [[World War II]].

Industrial deconcentration is a conscious goal in a comprehensive [[decentralization]] policy:  to deconcentrate population without excessive [[commuting]], jobs need to be created outside the cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25333">'''Macromolecular docking''' is the computational modelling of the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]] of [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]] formed by two or more interacting [[macromolecule|biological macromolecule]]s. [[Protein]]–protein complexes are the most commonly attempted targets of such modelling, followed by protein–[[nucleic acid]] complexes.

The ultimate goal of docking is the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of the macromolecular complex of interest as it would occur in a living organism.  Docking itself only produces plausible candidate structures.  These candidates must be ranked using methods such as [[scoring functions for docking|scoring functions]] to identify structures that are most likely to occur in nature.

The term "docking" originated in the late 1970s, with a more restricted meaning; then, "docking" meant refining a model of a complex structure by optimizing the separation between the [[interactor]]s but keeping their relative orientations fixed.  Later, the relative orientations of the interacting partners in the modelling was allowed to vary, but the internal geometry of each of the partners was held fixed. This type of modelling is sometimes referred to as "rigid docking".  With further increases in computational power, it became possible to model changes in internal geometry of the interacting partners that may occur when a complex is formed.  This type of modelling is referred to as "flexible docking".

== Background ==

The [[biology|biological]] roles of most proteins, as characterized by which other [[protein–protein interaction|macromolecules they interact with]], are known at best incompletely. Even those proteins that participate in a well-studied [[biological process]] (e.g., the [[Krebs cycle]]) may have unexpected interaction partners or [[function (biology)|function]]s which are unrelated to that process.

In cases of known protein–protein interactions, other questions arise. [[Genetic disease]]s (e.g., [[cystic fibrosis]]) are known to be caused by misfolded or [[mutation|mutated]] proteins, and there is a desire to understand what, if any, anomalous protein–protein interactions a given mutation can cause. In the distant future, proteins may be designed to perform biological functions, and a determination of the potential interactions of such proteins will be essential.

For any given set of proteins, the following questions may be of interest, from the point of view of technology or natural history:
* Do these proteins bind ''[[in vivo]]''?

If they do bind,
* What is the spatial configuration which they adopt in their [[bound state]]?
* How strong or weak is their interaction?

If they do not bind,
* Can they be made to bind by inducing a mutation?

Protein–protein docking is ultimately envisaged to address all these issues. Furthermore, since docking methods can be based on purely [[physics|physical]] principles, even proteins of unknown function (or which have been studied relatively little) may be docked. The only prerequisite is that their [[molecular structure]] has been either determined experimentally, or can be estimated by a [[protein structure prediction]] technique.

Protein–nucleic acid interactions feature prominently in the living cell. [[Transcription factors]], which regulate [[gene expression]], and [[polymerase]]s, which [[catalysis|catalyse]] [[DNA replication|replication]], are composed of proteins, and the [[genetic material]] they interact with is composed of nucleic acids. Modeling protein–nucleic acid complexes presents some unique challenges, as described below.

== History ==

In the 1970s, complex modelling revolved around manually identifying features on the surfaces of the interactors, and interpreting the consequences for binding, function and activity; any computer programmes were typically used at the end of the modelling process, to discriminate between the relatively few configurations which remained after all the heuristic constraints had been imposed. The first use of computers was in a study on [[hemoglobin]] interaction in [[sickle-cell]] fibres.&lt;ref name="pmid1055409"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levinthal C, Wodak SJ, Kahn P, Dadivanian AK | title = Hemoglobin Interactions in Sickle Cell Fibers: I.

The computer used a simplified representation of the interacting proteins, with one interaction centre for each residue. Favorable [[electrostatic]] interactions, including [[hydrogen bonds]], were identified by hand.&lt;ref name="pmid3310103"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wodak SJ, De Crombrugghe M, Janin J | title = Computer Studies of Interactions between Macromolecules | journal = Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–63 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3310103 | doi = 10.1016/0079-6107(87)90008-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, more structures of complexes were determined, and available computational power had increased substantially. With the emergence of [[bioinformatics]], the focus moved towards developing generalized techniques which could be applied to an arbitrary set of complexes at acceptable computational cost. The new methods were envisaged to apply even in the absence of phylogenetic or experimental clues; any specific prior knowledge could still be introduced at the stage of choosing between the highest ranking output models, or be framed as input if the algorithm catered for it.
1992 saw the publication of the correlation method,&lt;ref name="pmid1549581"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katchalski-Katzir E, Shariv I, Eisenstein M, Friesem AA, Aflalo C, Vakser IA  | title = Molecular surface recognition: determination of geometric fit between proteins and their ligands by correlation techniques | journal = Proc.

This was extended in 1997 to cover coarse electrostatics.&lt;ref name="pmid9299341"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gabb HA, Jackson RM, Sternberg MJ | title = Modelling protein docking using shape complementarity, electrostatics and biochemical information | journal = J.

In 1996 the results of the first blind trial were published,&lt;ref name="pmid8605624"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Strynadka NC, Eisenstein M, Katchalski-Katzir E, Shoichet BK, Kuntz ID, Abagyan R, Totrov M, Janin J, Cherfils J, Zimmerman F, Olson A, Duncan B, Rao M, Jackson R, Sternberg M, James MN | title = Molecular Docking Programs Successfully Predict the Binding of a Beta-lactamase Inhibitory Protein to TEM-1 Beta-Lactamase | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 3 | issue =  3 | pages = 233–239 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8605624 | doi = 10.1038/nsb0396-233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which six research groups attempted to predict the complexed structure of [[Beta-lactamase#TEM beta-lactamases (class A)|TEM-1 Beta-lactamase]] with Beta-lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP). The exercise brought into focus the necessity of accommodating conformational change and the difficulty of discriminating between conformers. It also served as the prototype for the CAPRI assessment series, which debuted in 2001.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Rigid-body docking ''vs''. flexible docking ==

If the [[molecular geometry|bond angles, bond lengths and torsion angles]] of the components are not modified at any stage of complex generation, it is known as ''rigid body docking''. A subject of speculation is whether or not rigid-body docking is sufficiently good for most docking. When substantial conformational change occurs within the components at the time of complex formation, rigid-body docking is inadequate. However, scoring all possible conformational changes is prohibitively expensive in computer time. Docking procedures which permit conformational change, or ''flexible docking'' procedures, must intelligently select small subset of possible conformational changes for consideration.

==Methods==
Successful docking requires two criteria:
*Generating a set of configurations which reliably includes at least one nearly correct one.
*Reliably distinguishing nearly correct configurations from the others.

For many interactions, the binding site is known on one or more of the proteins to be docked. This is the case for [[antibody|antibodies]] and for [[competitive inhibitor]]s. In other cases, a binding site may be strongly suggested by [[mutagenesis|mutagenic]] or [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] evidence. Configurations where the proteins interpenetrate severely may also be ruled out ''a priori''.

After making exclusions based on prior knowledge or [[stereochemistry|stereochemical]] clash, the remaining space of possible complexed structures must be sampled exhaustively, evenly and with a sufficient coverage to guarantee a near hit. Each configuration must be scored with a measure that is capable of ranking a nearly correct structure above at least 100,000 alternatives.  This is a computationally intensive task, and a variety of strategies have been developed.

=== Reciprocal space methods ===

Each of the proteins may be represented as a simple cubic lattice. Then, for the class of scores which are discrete [[convolution]]s, configurations related to each other by translation of one protein by an exact lattice vector can all be scored almost simultaneously by applying the [[convolution theorem]].&lt;ref name="pmid1549581" /&gt; It is possible to construct reasonable, if approximate, convolution-like scoring functions representing both stereochemical and electrostatic fitness.

Reciprocal space methods have been used extensively for their ability to evaluate enormous numbers of configurations. They lose their speed advantage if torsional changes are introduced. Another drawback is that it is impossible to make efficient use of prior knowledge. The question also remains whether convolutions are too limited a class of scoring function to identify the best complex reliably.

=== Monte Carlo methods ===

In [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]], an initial configuration is refined by taking random steps which are accepted or rejected based on their induced improvement in score (see the [[Metropolis-Hastings algorithm|Metropolis criterion]]), until a certain number of steps have been tried. The assumption is that convergence to the best structure should occur from a large class of initial configurations, only one of which needs to be considered. Initial configurations may be sampled coarsely, and much computation time can be saved. Because of the difficulty of finding a scoring function which is both highly discriminating for the correct configuration and also converges to the correct configuration from a distance, the use of two levels of refinement, with different scoring functions, has been proposed.&lt;ref name="pmid12875852"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gray JJ, Moughon S, Wang C, Schueler-Furman O, Kuhlman B, Rohl CA, Baker D | title = Protein–protein docking with simultaneous optimization of rigid-body displacement and side-chain conformations | journal = J.

Monte Carlo methods are not guaranteed to search exhaustively, so that the best configuration may be missed even using a scoring function which would in theory identify it. How severe a problem this is for docking has not been firmly established.

=== Scoring functions ===
{{main|Scoring functions for docking}}
To find a score which forms a consistent basis for selecting the best configuration, studies are carried out on a standard benchmark (see below) of protein–protein interaction cases. Scoring functions are assessed on the rank they assign to the best structure (ideally the best structure should be ranked 1), and on their coverage (the proportion of the benchmark cases for which they achieve an acceptable result).
Types of scores studied include:
*[[Heuristic]] scores based on [[amino-acid|residue]] contacts.
*Shape complementarity of [[Accessible surface area|molecular surfaces]] ("stereochemistry").
*Free energies, estimated using parameters from [[molecular mechanics]] [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]]s such as [[CHARMM]] or [[AMBER]].
*Phylogenetic desirability of the interacting regions.
*Clustering coefficients.
*Information based cues.

It is usual to create hybrid scores by combining one or more categories above in a weighted sum whose weights are optimized on cases from the benchmark. To avoid bias, the benchmark cases used to optimize the weights must not overlap with the cases used to make the final test of the score.

The ultimate goal in protein–protein docking is to select the ideal ranking solution according to a scoring scheme that would also give an insight into the affinity of the complex. Such a development would drive ''in silico'' [[protein engineering]], [[computer-aided drug design]] and/or high-throughput annotation of which proteins bind or not (annotation of [[interactome]]). Several scoring functions have been proposed for binding affinity / free energy prediction.&lt;ref name="pmid12875852" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11517309"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.181147798 |vauthors=Camacho CJ, Vajda S | title = Protein docking along smooth association pathways | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 98 | issue = 19 | pages = 10636–10641 | year = 2008 | pmid = 11517309 | pmc = 58518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17559675"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1472-6807-7-37 |vauthors=Camacho CJ, Vajda S | title = In silico screening of mutational effects on enzyme-proteic inhibitor affinity: a docking-based approach | journal = BMC Structural Biology | volume = 7 | pages = 37 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17559675 | pmc = 1913526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15801826"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang C, Liu S, Zhu Q, Zhou Y | title = A knowledge-based energy function for protein–ligand, protein–protein, and protein–DNA complexes | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 48 | issue = 7 | pages = 2325–2335 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15801826 | doi = 10.1021/jm049314d }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Esmaielbeiki R, Nebel JC |year=2014|title=Scoring docking conformations using predicted protein interfaces|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=15|page=171|doi= 10.1186/1471-2105-15-171|pmid=24906633|pmc=4057934}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the correlation between experimentally determined binding affinities and the predictions of nine commonly used scoring functions have been found to be nearly [[orthogonal]] (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ~ 0).&lt;ref name="pmid20329755"/&gt;&lt;ref name="evaluation"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosato A, Fuentes G, Verma C | title = Faculty of 1000 Biology: evaluations for Kastritis PL &amp; Bonvin AM J Proteome Res 2010 May 7 9 (5) :2216-25 | journal = Faculty of 1000 Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 2216–2225 | year = 2010 | url = http://f1000biology.com/article/id/3437978/evaluation | doi = 10.1021/pr9009854 | pmid = 20329755 | hdl = 1874/202590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also observed that some components of the scoring algorithms may display better correlation to the experimental binding energies than the full score, suggesting that a significantly better performance might be obtained by combining the appropriate contributions from different scoring algorithms.  Experimental methods for the determination of binding affinities are: [[surface plasmon resonance]] (SPR),  [[Förster resonance energy transfer]], [[radioligand]]-based techniques, [[isothermal titration calorimetry]] (ITC), [[microscale thermophoresis]] (MST) or spectroscopic measurements and other fluorescence techniques. Textual information from scientific articles can provide useful cues for scoring.&lt;ref name="pmid29506465"&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1186/s12859-018-2079-4|vauthors= Badal, VD, Kundrotas, PJ, Vakser, IA | title = Natural language processing in text mining for structural modeling of protein complexes|journal = BMC Bioinformatics |volume= 19 |issue= 1 |pages= 84 |year=2018|pmid = 29506465 |pmc= 5838950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benchmarks ===
A benchmark of 84 protein–protein interactions with known complexed structures has been developed for testing docking methods.&lt;ref name="pmid15981264"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mintseris J, Wiehe K, Pierce B, Anderson R, Chen R, Janin J, Weng Z | title = Protein-Protein Docking Benchmark 2.0: an update | journal = Proteins | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 214–216 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15981264 | doi = 10.1002/prot.20560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The set is chosen to cover a wide range of interaction types, and to avoid repeated features, such as the profile of interactors' structural families according to the [[Structural Classification of Proteins|SCOP]] database. Benchmark elements are classified into three levels of difficulty (the most difficult containing the largest change in backbone conformation). The protein–protein docking benchmark contains examples of enzyme-inhibitor, antigen-antibody and homomultimeric complexes.

The latest version of protein-protein docking benchmark consists of  230 complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vreven T, Moal IH, Vangone A, Pierce BG, Kastritis PL, Torchala M, Chaleil R, Jiménez-García B, Bates PA, Fernandez-Recio J, Bonvin AM, Weng Z | title = Updates to the Integrated Protein-Protein Interaction Benchmarks: Docking Benchmark Version 5 and Affinity Benchmark Version 2 | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 427 | issue = 19 | pages = 3031–41 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26231283 | pmc = 4677049 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2015.07.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A protein-DNA docking benchmark consists of 47 test cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Dijk M, Bonvin AM | title = A protein-DNA docking benchmark | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 36 | issue = 14 | pages = e88 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18583363 | pmc = 2504314 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn386 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A protein-RNA docking benchmark was curated as a dataset of 45 non-redundant test cases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barik A, C N, P M, Bahadur RP | title = A protein-RNA docking benchmark (I): nonredundant cases | journal = Proteins | volume = 80 | issue = 7 | pages = 1866–71 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22488669 | doi = 10.1002/prot.24083 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with complexes solved by [[X-ray crystallography]] only as well as an extended dataset of 71 test cases with structures derived from [[Homology modeling|homology modelling]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pérez-Cano L, Jiménez-García B, Fernández-Recio J | title = A protein-RNA docking benchmark (II): extended set from experimental and homology modeling data | journal = Proteins | volume = 80 | issue = 7 | pages = 1872–82 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22488990 | doi = 10.1002/prot.24075 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protein-RNA benchmark has been updated to include more structures solved by [[X-ray crystallography]] and now it consists of 126 test cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nithin C, Mukherjee S, Bahadur RP | title = A non-redundant protein-RNA docking benchmark version 2.0 | journal = Proteins | pages = 256–267 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27862282 | doi = 10.1002/prot.25211 | volume=85| issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The benchmarks have a combined dataset of 209 complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nithin|first=Chandran|last2=Ghosh|first2=Pritha|last3=Bujnicki|first3=Janusz|last4=Nithin|first4=Chandran|last5=Ghosh|first5=Pritha|last6=Bujnicki|first6=Janusz M.|date=2018-08-25|title=Bioinformatics Tools and Benchmarks for Computational Docking and 3D Structure Prediction of RNA-Protein Complexes|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/9/9/432|journal=Genes|language=en|volume=9|issue=9|pages=432|doi=10.3390/genes9090432|pmid=30149645|pmc=6162694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each entry of the benchmark includes several biochemical parameters associated with the experimental data, along with the method used to determine the affinity. This benchmark was used to assess the extent to which scoring functions could also predict affinities of macromolecular complexes.

This Benchmark was post-peer reviewed and significantly expanded.&lt;ref name="pmid21213247"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kastritis PL, Moal IH, Hwang H, Weng Z, Bates PA, Bonvin AM, Janin J | title = A structure-based benchmark for protein-protein binding affinity | journal = Protein Science | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 482–491 |date=March 2011 | pmid = 21213247 | doi = 10.1002/pro.580 | url = | issn = | pmc = 3064828 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new set is diverse in terms of the biological functions it represents, with complexes that involve G-proteins and receptor extracellular domains, as well as antigen/antibody, enzyme/inhibitor, and enzyme/substrate complexes. It is also diverse in terms of the partners' affinity for each other, with K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; ranging between 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; M. Nine pairs of entries represent closely related complexes that have a similar structure, but a very different affinity, each pair comprising a cognate and a noncognate assembly. The unbound structures of the component proteins being available, conformation changes can be assessed. They are significant in most of the complexes, and large movements or disorder-to-order transitions are frequently observed. The set may be used to benchmark biophysical models aiming to relate affinity to structure in protein–protein interactions, taking into account the reactants and the conformation changes that accompany the association reaction, instead of just the final product.&lt;ref name="pmid21213247"/&gt;

Rounds take place approximately every 6 months. Each round contains between one and six target protein–protein complexes whose structures have been recently determined experimentally. The coordinates and are held privately by the assessors, with the cooperation of the [[structural biology|structural biologist]]s who determined them. The assessment of submissions is [[double blind]].

CAPRI attracts a high level of participation (37 groups participated worldwide in round seven) and a high level of interest from the biological community in general. Although CAPRI results are of little statistical significance owing to the small number of targets in each round, the role of CAPRI in stimulating discourse is significant. (The [[CASP]] assessment is a similar exercise in the field of protein structure prediction).

The '''Madras Institute of Development Studies''' ('''MIDS''') is a research institute based in [[Chennai]]. It is a joint undertaking of the Governments of [[Government of India|India]] and [[Government of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu]] for conducting research on development problems in [[Tamil Nadu]] and the rest of [[India]].&lt;ref name="mids1"&gt;.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
MIDS was established by [[Malcolm Adiseshiah]] and his wife Elizabeth Adiseshiah in January 1971. Malcolm Adiseshiah served as its first Director. In March 1977, MIDS was reconstituted as a National Research Institute under the sponsorship of [[Government of India]] through the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]] and the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]]. The Adiseshiah's donated the land, buildings, furniture, equipment and made cash endowments to the newly constituted institute. Malcolm Adiseshiah resigned as MIDS' Director in 1978 and became the Chairman and Honorary fellow. Professor [[C.T. Kurien]] became the next Director of MIDS. In 1985, the [[Reserve Bank of India]] established a Chair for applied research in regional economics, which has since been converted to a fully autonomous unit in 2002.&lt;ref name="mids1"/&gt;

==Administration==
MIDS is governed by a Governing Council and an Academic Council. The Governing Council consists of the Chairperson, the Institute's Director as member-secretary, representatives of faculty, the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]], the Government of Tamil Nadu, and from the universities of the four South Indian states, trustees of the Institute, and co-opted social scientists, as members. It ordinarily meets once a year, while its Finance Committee and Executive Council meet twice a year. The Academic Council consists of the Director as chairperson, and both external and internal members. All the professors of the Institute are its members; other faculty members and the Ph.D. scholars serve on it in rotation. Five reputed social scientists from other universities and institutes are members of the Academic Council. Each of them serve for three years. The Council meets twice a year to review, and provide guidelines on, the academic activities of the Institute.&lt;ref name="mids1"/&gt;

==Academics==
MIDS' research focuses on subjects like development and planning, centre-state relationship, poverty, inequality, agrarian issues, social movements, caste and communal politics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eldis.org/go/home&amp;id=4394&amp;type=Organisation&lt;/ref&gt; It offers a full-time doctoral program under three classes - Indian Council of Social Science Research fellowships, RBI{{clarify|date=October 2017|reason=what is this jargon?}} fellowships and Malcolm &amp; Elizabeth Adiseshiah Ph.D. Merit Scholarship. It also offers an annual award called "The Malcolm Adiseshiah award" for mid-career academicians in the field of developmental studies. Prominent faculty members of MIDS (both past and present) include [[Kaushik Basu]], [[A R Venkatachalapathy]], Padmini Swaminathan and  K. Nagaraj. Its publication cell publishes books and academic papers (sometimes in collaboration with Kalachuvadu Pathippagam, a Tamil publishing house). It also brings out a bi-annual bulletin called "Review of Development and Change".&lt;ref name="mids2"&gt;.

In [[optics]], '''Matthiessen's ratio''' is the ratio between the distance from the centre of the [[Lens (optics)|lens]] to the [[retina]], versus the lens [[radius]].&lt;ref name='shand'&gt;{{Cite journal

This is of particular importance in [[fish]], where the value may decrease from as high as 3.6 to 2.3,&lt;ref name="shand"/&gt; decreasing the [[focal ratio]] of the [[Lens (optics)|lens]]. A higher focal ratio is thought to compensate for the relatively high Matthiessen’s ratio brought about by constraints of small eye size during early development. This provides a means for [[larva]]l fish to [[wikt:focus|focus]] images from different distances, before the ability to [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodate]] is gained.&lt;ref name="shand"/&gt;

'''Normal contact stiffness''' is a physical quantity related to the generalized force displacement behavior of [[Surface roughness|rough surface]]s in contact with a [[rigid body]] or a second similar rough surface.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} As two solid bodies of the same material approach one another, they transition from conditions of non-contact to homogeneous bulk type behaviour. The varying values of stiffness and true contact area that is exhibited at an interface during this transition is dependent on conditions of applied pressure and is of notable importance for the study of systems involving the physical interactions of multiple bodies including [[granular matter]], [[electrode]] contacts, and [[thermal contact]]s, where the interface-localized structures govern overall system performance.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Surface structure==
The role of [[surface structure]] in normal contact mechanics, in terms of stiffness and true contact area is a frequently studied topic.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Parameters of roughness, [[fractal dimension]] and [[Asperity (materials science)|asperity geometry]] are often discussed{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} with reference to their significance on contact mechanics of surfaces.

==Biography==

The older brother of the zoologist [[Herluf Winge]], Oluf also had since childhood a great interest in animals. He took in 1881 the title of "Magisterkonferens" in Natural History and in 1883 became assistant at the [[University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum|Zoologisk Museum]]. He worked mainly with ornithology, such as the birds recovered from the lighthouses in [[Denmark]]&lt;ref name=Collin1905 /&gt; and his most important work, "Fugle fra Knoglehuler i Brasilien" (1888), on the fossil birds discovered in the caves in of the state of [[Minas Gerais]] in [[Brazil]] by his compatriot paleontologist [[Peter Wilhelm Lund]].&lt;ref name=Winge1888&gt;Winge, O. (1888) Fugle fra Knoglehuler i Brasilien – E Museo Lundii 1 (2): 1-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1889, 33 years old, from an "incurable breast suffering".&lt;ref name=Collin1905 /&gt;

The [[Pleistocene]] condor genus ''[[Wingegyps]]'' is named after him.&lt;ref name=Alvarenga&amp;Olson2004&gt;Alvarenga, H. M. F.; Olson, S. L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3085">In [[solid-state physics]], the '''Poole–Frenkel effect''' (also known as '''Frenkel-Poole emission'''&lt;ref name="Sze"&gt;Sze, ''Physics of Semiconductor Devices'', 2nd edition, Section 4.3.4.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a means by which an [[electrical insulator]] can conduct electricity. It is named after [[Yakov Frenkel]], who published on it in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;J. Frenkel, "On pre-breakdown phenomena in insulators and electronic semi-conductors", Phys. Rev., vol. 54, pp. 647-648, 1938. In this paper published in USA, Frenkel only very briefly mentioned an empirical relationship as Poole's law. Frenkel cited Poole's paper when he wrote a longer article in a Soviet journal. (Note: Yakov Frenkel quite frequently put down his name as J. Frenkel when he published his papers in journals using the English language.)&lt;/ref&gt; and also after H. H. Poole (Horace Hewitt Poole, 1886-1962), Ireland.

Electrons can move (slowly) through an insulator by the following method. The electrons are generally trapped in localized states (loosely speaking, they are "stuck" to a single atom, and not free to move around the crystal). Occasionally, random thermal fluctuations will give that electron enough energy to get out of its localized state, and move to the [[conduction band]]. Once there, the electron can move through the crystal, for a brief amount of time, before relaxing into another localized state (in other words, "sticking" to a different atom). The Poole–Frenkel effect describes how, in a large [[electric field]], the electron doesn't need as much thermal energy to get into the conduction band (because part of this energy comes from being pulled by the electric field), so it does not need as large a thermal fluctuation and will be able to move more frequently.

Taking everything into account (both the frequency with which electrons get excited into the conduction band, and their motion once they're there), the standard quantitative expression for the Poole–Frenkel effect is:&lt;ref name=Sze/&gt;&lt;ref name=rottlaender&gt;Rottländer et al., Phys. Rev. B 65, 054422 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J \propto E \exp \left ( \frac{-q \left ( \phi_B-\sqrt{qE/(\pi \epsilon)} \ \right ) }{k_BT} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''J'' is the [[current density]]
:''E'' is the applied [[electric field]]
:''q'' is the [[elementary charge]]
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_B&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage barrier (in zero applied electric field) that an electron must cross to move from one atom to another in the crystal
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the dynamic [[permittivity]]
:&lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]]
:''T'' is the [[temperature]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1028">The '''principle of similitude''' is a supplement to the [[scientific method]] advocated by [[Lord Rayleigh]] (1842–1919) that requires that any suggested scientific law be examined for its relationship to similar laws.

The principle of similitude is very often used in scientific studies. For example, the study of blood flow known as [[hemodynamics]]. This study sometimes require the modeling of blood vessels [[in vitro]]. Here, the principle of similitude plays a huge role in ensuring the conditions of the model reproduces all aspects of behavior as the blood vessel in study. 

Various techniques are implemented when applying the principle of similitude. A well known technique is [[dimensional analysis]].

'''Psychological resilience''' is the ability to successfully cope with a crisis and to return to pre-crisis status quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Terte|first=Ian|last2=Stephens|first2=Christine|date=2014|title=Psychological Resilience of Workers in High-Risk Occupations|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smi.2627|journal=Stress and Health|language=en|volume=30|issue=5|pages=353–355|doi=10.1002/smi.2627|issn=1532-3005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resilience exists when the person uses "mental processes and behaviors in promoting personal assets and protecting self from the potential negative effects of stressors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Ivan T.|last2=Cooper|first2=Cary L.|last3=Sarkar|first3=Mustafa|last4=Curran|first4=Thomas|date=2015-04-25|title=Resilience training in the workplace from 2003 to 2014: A systematic review|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joop.12120|journal=Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology|language=en|volume=88|issue=3|pages=533–562|doi=10.1111/joop.12120|issn=0963-1798}}&lt;/ref&gt; In simpler terms, psychological resilience exists in people who develop psychological and behavioral capabilities that allow them to remain calm during crises/chaos and to move on from the incident without long-term negative consequences. Psychological resilience is an evolutionary advantage that most people have and use to manage normal stressors.

==Background==

Resilience is generally thought of as a "positive adaptation" after a stressful or adverse situation.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hopf S.M |title= Risk and Resilience in Children Coping with Parental Divorce|journal= Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science |year=2010|url=http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/spring-2010/risk-and-resilience-in-children-coping-with-parental-divorce#.VTceVpNGRHA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a person is "bombarded by daily stress, it disrupts their internal and external sense of balance, presenting challenges as well as opportunities". Resilience is the integrated adaptation of physical, mental and spiritual aspects in a set of "good or bad" circumstances, a coherent sense of self that is able to maintain normative developmental tasks that occur at various stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Richardson | first=Glenn E. | title=The metatheory of resilience and resiliency | journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | volume=58 | issue=3 | year=2002 | issn=0021-9762 | doi=10.1002/jclp.10020 | pages=307–321 | pmid=11836712}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Children's Institute of the [[University of Rochester]] explains that "resilience research is focused on studying those who engage in life with hope and humor despite devastating losses".&lt;ref name="childrens_institute"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.childrensinstitute.net/sites/default/files/documents/children-resilience-family-court-review.pdf | title=Fostering children's resilience in the aftermath of divorce: The role of evidence-based programs for children | work=Children's Institute, [[University of Rochester]] | date=2005 | accessdate=30 March 2016 | author=Pedro-Carroll, JoAnne | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is important to note that resilience is not only about overcoming a deeply stressful situation, but also coming out of the said situation with "competent functioning". Resiliency allows a person to rebound from adversity as a strengthened and more resourceful person.

==History==

The first research on resilience was published in 1973. The study used [[epidemiology]], which is the study of disease prevalence, to uncover the risks and the protective factors that now help define resilience.&lt;ref&gt;Garmezy, N. (1973). "Competence and adaptation in adult schizophrenic patients and children at risk", pp. 163–204 in Dean, S. R. (Ed.), ''Schizophrenia: The first ten Dean Award Lectures''. NY: MSS Information Corp.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the same group of researchers created tools to look at systems that support development of resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garmezy | first1 = N. | last2 = Streitman | first2 = S. | year = 1974 | title = Children at risk: The search for the antecedents of schizophrenia. Part 1. Conceptual models and research methods | journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin | volume = 1 | issue = 8| pages = 14–90 | pmid = 4619494 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/1.8.14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmy Werner]] was one of the early scientists to use the term ''resilience'' in the 1970s. She studied a cohort of children from [[Kauai]], Hawaii. Kauai was quite poor and many of the children in the study grew up with alcoholic or mentally ill parents. Many of the parents were also out of work.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, E. E. (1971). ''The children of Kauai : a longitudinal study from the prenatal period to age ten''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|0870228609}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner noted that of the children who grew up in these detrimental situations, two-thirds exhibited destructive behaviors in their later teen years, such as chronic unemployment, substance abuse, and out-of-[[marriage|wedlock]] births (in case of teenage girls). However, one-third of these youngsters did not exhibit destructive behaviours. Werner called the latter group 'resilient'.&lt;ref name=w1989&gt;Werner, E. E. (1989). ''Vulnerable but invincible: a longitudinal study of resilient children and youth''. New York: McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0937431036}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, resilient children and their families were those who, by definition, demonstrated traits that allowed them to be more successful than non-resilient children and families.

Resilience also emerged as a major theoretical and research topic from the studies of children with mothers diagnosed with schizophrenia in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Masten, Best 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masten | first1 = A. S. | last2 = Best | first2 = K. M. | last3 = Garmezy | first3 = N. | year = 1990 | title = Resilience and development: Contributions from the study of children who overcome adversity | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 425–444 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579400005812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1989 study,&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A. S. (1989). "Resilience in development: Implications of the study of successful adaptation for developmental psychopathology". In D. Cicchetti (Ed.), ''The emergence of a discipline: Rochester symposium on developmental psychopathology'' (Vol. 1, pp. 261–294). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|0805805532}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the results showed that children with a [[schizophrenic]] parent may not obtain an appropriate level of comforting caregiving—compared to children with healthy parents—and that such situations often had a detrimental impact on children's development. On the other hand, some children of ill parents thrived well and were competent in academic achievement, and therefore led researchers to make efforts to understand such responses to adversity.

Since the onset of the research on resilience, researchers have been devoted to discovering the protective factors that explain people's adaptation to adverse conditions, such as maltreatment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cicchetti | first1 = D. | last2 = Rogosch | first2 = F. A. | year = 1997 | title = The role of self-organization in the promotion of resilience in maltreated children | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 797–815 | pmid= 9449006 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579497001442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; catastrophic life events,&lt;ref name="Fredrickson, Tugade 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fredrickson | first1 = B.

S. (1999). ''Poverty and children's adjustment.'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage, {{ISBN|0761905189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of empirical work then has been shifted to understand the underlying protective processes. Researchers endeavor to uncover how some factors (e.g. connection to family) may contribute to positive outcomes.&lt;ref name="Luthar 1999"/&gt;

==Process==

In all these instances, resilience is best understood as a process. It is often mistakenly assumed to be a trait of the individual, an idea more typically referred to as "resiliency".&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A.S. (1994). "Resilience in individual development: Successful adaptation despite risk and adversity", pp. 3–25 in M. Wang &amp; E. Gordon (Eds.), ''Risk and resilience in inner city America: challenges and prospects''. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|080581325X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most research now shows that resilience is the result of individuals being able to interact with their environments and the processes that either promote well-being or protect them against the overwhelming influence of risk factors.&lt;ref name="Zautra, A.J. 2010 pp. 3-34"&gt;Zautra, A.J., Hall, J.S. &amp; Murray, K.E. (2010). "Resilience: A new definition of health for people and communities", pp. 3–34 in J.W. Reich, A.J. Zautra &amp; J.S. Hall (eds.), ''Handbook of adult resilience''. New York: Guilford, {{ISBN|146250647X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential to understand the process or this cycle of resiliency. When people are faced with an adverse condition, there are three ways in which they may approach the situation.

# Erupt with anger
# Implode with overwhelming negative emotions, go numb, and become unable to react
# Simply become upset about the disruptive change

Only the third approach promotes well-being. It is employed by resilient people, who become upset about the disruptive state and thus change their current pattern to cope with the issue. The first and second approaches lead people to adopt the victim role by [[projection (psychology)|blaming others]] and rejecting any coping methods even after the crisis is over. These people prefer to instinctively react, rather than respond to the situation. Those who respond to the adverse conditions by adapting themselves tend to cope, spring back, and halt the crisis. Negative emotions involve fear, anger, anxiety, distress, helplessness, and hopelessness which decrease a person's ability to solve the problems they face and weaken a person's resiliency. Constant fears and worries weaken people's immune system and increase their vulnerability to illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert, Al (2005). ''The Resiliency Advantage'', pp. 2–4. Berrett-Koehler Publishers. {{ISBN|1576753298}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These processes include individual coping strategies, or may be helped by a protective environment like good [[family resilience|families]], schools, communities, and social policies that make resilience more likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, B., Dodgen, D. &amp; Solarz, A. (2005). "The resilience revolution: A paradigm shift for research and policy", pp. 47–63 in R.D. Peters, B. Leadbeater &amp; R.J. McMahon (eds.), ''Resilience in children, families, and communities: Linking context to practice and policy''. New York: Kluwer. {{ISBN|0306486555}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense "resilience" occurs when there are cumulative "protective factors". These factors are likely to play a more important role, the greater the individual's exposure to cumulative risk factors.

==Biological models==
Three notable bases for resilience—self-confidence, self-esteem and [[self-concept]]—all have roots in three different nervous systems—respectively, the [[somatic nervous system]], the [[autonomic nervous system]] and the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;Siebert, Al (2005). ''The Resiliency Advantage'', pp. 74–78. Berrett-Koehler Publishers. {{ISBN|1576753298}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An emerging field in the study of resilience is the neurobiological basis of resilience to stress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/339586/title/Brain_scan_foretells_who_will_fold_under_pressure Brain scan foretells who will fold under pressure; Tests on high-stakes math problems identify key regions of neural activity linked to choking], sciencenews.org (May 5, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and 5-Dehydroepiandrosterone (5-DHEA) are thought to limit the stress response by reducing sympathetic nervous system activation and protecting the brain from the potentially harmful effects of chronically elevated cortisol levels respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Charney|first1= DS |title=Psychobiological mechanisms of resilience and vulnerability: implications for successful adaptation to extreme stress |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=195–216 |year=2004 |pmid=14754765 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.2.195}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the relationship between social support and stress resilience is thought to be mediated by the oxytocin system's impact on the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=18627668| year=2008| last1=Ozbay| first1=F| last2=Fitterling| first2=H| last3=Charney| first3=D| last4=Southwick| first4=S| title=Social support and resilience to stress across ''the life'' span: A neurobiologic framework| volume=10| issue=4| pages=304–10| journal=Current Psychiatry Reports| doi=10.1007/s11920-008-0049-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Resilience, conceptualized as a positive bio-psychological adaptation, has proven to be a useful theoretical context for understanding variables for predicting long-term health and well-being".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Parental resilience: A neglected construct in resilience research|doi = 10.1111/cp.12053 | volume=19|issue=3|journal=Clinical Psychologist|pages=111–121|authors=Gavidia-Payne, S., Denny, B., Davis, K., Francis, A. and Jackson, M.|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some limited research that, like trauma, resilience is [[epigenetic]]—that is, it may be inherited—but the science behind this finding is preliminary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/28/trauma-may-be-woven-dna-native-americans-160508|work=Indian Country Today|title=Trauma May Be Woven in DNA of Native Americans|last=Pember|first=Mary Annette|date=May 28, 2015|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related factors==

Studies show that there are several factors which develop and sustain a person's resilience:&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;American Psychological Association. (2014). [http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/road-resilience.aspx The Road to Resilience].&lt;/ref&gt;

# The ability to make realistic plans and being capable of taking the steps necessary to follow through with them
# Confidence in one's strengths and abilities
# Communication and problem-solving skills
# The ability to manage strong impulses and feelings

Resilience is negatively correlated with personality traits of neuroticism and negative emotionality, which represents tendencies to see and react to the world as threatening, problematic, and distressing, and to view oneself as vulnerable. Positive correlations stands with personality traits of openness and positive emotionality, that represents tendencies to engage and confront the world with confidence in success and a fair value to [[self-directedness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John W. Reich|author2=Alex J. Zautra|author3=John Stuart Hall|title=Handbook of Adult Resilience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyRc8ZshU98C&amp;pg=PA114|year=2012|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-4625-0647-7|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive emotions===

There is significant research found in scientific literature on the relationship between [[positive emotions]] and resilience. Studies show that maintaining positive emotions whilst facing adversity promote flexibility in thinking and problem solving. Positive emotions serve an important function in their ability to help an individual recover from stressful experiences and encounters. That being said, maintaining a positive emotionality aids in counteracting the physiological effects of negative emotions. It also facilitates adaptive coping, builds enduring social resources, and increases personal well-being.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson, B. L. 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 21852891 | pmc = 3156609 | year = 2005 | author1 = Fredrickson | first1 = B. L. | title = Positive emotions broaden the scope of attention and thought-action repertoires | journal = Cognition &amp; Emotion | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–332 | last2 = Branigan | first2 = C | doi = 10.1080/02699930441000238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formation of conscious perception and monitoring one's own socioemotional factors is considered as a stability aspect of positive emotions.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} This is not to say that positive emotions are merely a by-product of resilience, but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual.&lt;ref name=tugade&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 14769087 | pmc = 3132556 | year = 2004 | author1 = Tugade | first1 = M. M. | title = Resilient individuals use positive emotions to bounce back from negative emotional experiences | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 320–33 | last2 = Fredrickson | first2 = B. L. | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.86.2.320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.91.4.730| pmid = 17014296| title = Psychological resilience, positive emotions, and successful adaptation to stress in later life| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| volume = 91| issue = 4| pages = 730–49| year = 2006| last1 = Ong | first1 = A.

Positive emotions not only have physical outcomes but also physiological ones. Some physiological outcomes caused by humor include improvements in immune system functioning and increases in levels of salivary [[immunoglobulin A]], a vital system antibody, which serves as the body's first line of defense in respiratory illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00223980209604148| pmid = 12081092| title = Perceived Attributes of Health-Promoting Laughter: A Cross-Generational Comparison| journal = The Journal of Psychology| volume = 136| issue = 2| pages = 171–81| year = 2002| last1 = Mahony | first1 = D.

H. | last2 = Minchoff | first2 = B. | last3 = Dillon | first3 = K. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, other health outcomes include faster injury recovery rate and lower readmission rates to hospitals for the elderly, and reductions in a patient's stay in the hospital, among many other benefits. A study was done on positive emotions in trait-resilient individuals and the cardiovascular recovery rate following negative emotions felt by those individuals. The results of the study showed that trait-resilient individuals experiencing positive emotions had an acceleration in the speed in rebounding from cardiovascular activation initially generated by negative emotional arousal, i.e. heart rate and the like.&lt;ref name=tugade/&gt;

===Grit===
{{Main|Grit (personality trait)}}
Grit refers to the perseverance and passion for long-term goals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duckworth|first1= A.L. |last2=Peterson|first2= C. |last3=Matthews|first3= M.D. |last4=Kelly|first4= D.R. |title= Grit: perseverance and passion for long-term goals. |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol|volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=11087–1101 |year=2007 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1087}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is characterized as working persistently towards challenges, maintained effort and interest over years despite negative feedback, adversity, plateaus in progress, or failure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; High grit people view accomplishments as a marathon rather than an immediate goal. High grit individuals display a sustained and focused application of self in problematic situations than less gritty individuals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Grit affects the effort a person contributes by acting on the importance pathway. When people value a goal as more valuable, meaningful, or relevant to their self-concept they are willing to expend more effort on it when necessary. The influence of individual differences in grit results in different levels of effort-related cardiac activity when gritty and less gritty individuals performed the same task. Grit is associated with differences in potential motivation, one pathway in motivational intensity theory. Grit may also influence an individual's perception of task difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Silvia|first1= P.J. |last2=Eddington|first2= K.M. |last3=Beaty|first3= R.E. |last4=Nusbaum|first4= E.C. |last5=Kwapil|first5= T.R. |title= Gritty people try harder: grit and effort-related cardiac autonomic activity during an active coping challenge |journal=J Int J Psychophysiol|volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=200–205 |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2013.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grit was highly correlated with the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] [[conscientiousness]] trait.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although grit and conscientiousness highly overlap in their achievement aspects, they differ in their emphasis. Grit emphasizes long-term stamina, whereas conscientiousness focuses on short-term intensity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Grit varies with level of education and age. More educated adults tend to be higher in grit than less educated individuals of the same age.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Post college graduates report higher grit levels than most other education level groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Grit increases with age when education level is controlled for.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In life achievements, grit may be as important as talent. College students at an elite university who scored high in grit also earned higher GPAs than their classmates, despite having lower SAT scores.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In a study at the West Point military academy it was found that grit was a more reliable predictor of first summer retention than self-control or a summary measure of cadet quality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Gritty competitors at the Scripps National Spelling Bee outranked other competitors who scored lower in grit, at least partially due to accumulated practice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Grit may also serve as a protective factor against [[suicide]]. A study at [[Stanford University]] found that grit was predictive of psychological health and well-being in medical residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salles|first1= A. |last2=Cohen|first2= G.L. |last3=Mueller|first3= C.M. |title= The relationship between grit and resident well-being|journal=Am J Surg|volume=207 |issue=2 |pages=251–254|year=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2013.09.006|pmid= 24238604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gritty individuals possess self-control and regular commitment to goals that allows them to resist impulses, such as to engage in [[self-harm]]. Individuals high in grit also focus on future goals, which may stop them from attempting suicide. It is believed that because grit encourages individuals to create and sustain life goals, these goals provide meaning and purpose in life. Grit alone does not seem to be sufficient, however. Only individuals with high gratitude and grit have decreased suicidal ideation over long periods of time. Gratitude and grit work together to enhance meaning in life, offering protection against death and suicidal thoughts or plans.&lt;ref name=Kleinman&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kleinman|first1= E.M. |last2=Adams|first2= L.M. |last3=Kashdan|first3= T.B. |last4=Riskind|first4= J.H. |title= Gratitude and grit indirectly reduce risk of suicidal ideations by enhancing meaning in life: Evidence for a mediated moderation mode |journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=539–546|year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2013.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other factors===

A study was conducted among high achieving professionals who seek challenging situations that require resilience. Research has examined 13 high achievers from various professions, all of whom had experienced challenges in the workplace and negative life events over the course of their careers but who had also been recognized for their great achievements in their respective fields. Participants were interviewed about everyday life in the workplace as well as their experiences with resilience and thriving. The study found six main predictors of resilience: positive and proactive personality, experience and learning, sense of control, flexibility and adaptability, balance and perspective, and perceived social support. High achievers were also found to engage in many activities unrelated to their work such as engaging in hobbies, exercising, and organizing meetups with friends and loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/spy0000003| title = Ordinary magic, extraordinary performance: Psychological resilience and thriving in high achievers| journal = Sport, Exercise, and Performance Psychology| volume = 3| pages = 46–60| year = 2014| last1 = Sarkar | first1 = M. | last2 = Fletcher | first2 = D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors are found to modify the negative effects of adverse life situations. Many studies show that the primary factor for the development of resilience is social support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theron|first=Linda|last2=van Rensburg|first2=Angelique|date=August 2018|title=Resilience over time: Learning from school-attending adolescents living in conditions of structural inequality|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140197118301052|journal=Journal of Adolescence|volume=67|pages=167–178|doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2018.06.012|issn=0140-1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abraham 359–366"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abraham|first=Ruth|last2=Lien|first2=Lars|last3=Hanssen|first3=Ingrid|date=2018-03-27|title=Coping, resilience and posttraumatic growth among Eritrean female refugees living in Norwegian asylum reception centres: A qualitative study|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F0020764018765237|journal=International Journal of Social Psychiatry|language=en|volume=64|issue=4|pages=359–366|doi=10.1177/0020764018765237|issn=0020-7640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagnon|first=Anita J.|last2=Stewart|first2=Donna E.|date=2013-11-13|title=Resilience in international migrant women following violence associated with pregnancy|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00737-013-0392-5|journal=Archives of Women's Mental Health|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=303–310|doi=10.1007/s00737-013-0392-5|issn=1434-1816}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many competing definitions of social support exist, most can be thought of as the degree of access to, and use of, strong ties to other individuals who are similar to one’s self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Nan|last2=Woelfel|first2=Mary W.|last3=Light|first3=Stephen C.|date=September 1985|title=The Buffering Effect of Social Support Subsequent to an Important Life Event|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2136756|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=26|issue=3|pages=247|doi=10.2307/2136756|issn=0022-1465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social support requires not only that you have relationships with others, but that these relationships involve the presence of solidarity and [[Trust (emotion)|trust]], intimate communication, and mutual obligation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perlin|first=L.|date=1981|title="The stress process."|url=|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=22|pages=337–56|via=EbscoHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; both within and outside the [[family]].&lt;ref name="Abraham 359–366"/&gt; Additional factors are also associated with resilience, like the capacity to make realistic plans, having [[self-confidence]] and a positive [[self image]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elm|first1=Jessica|title="I'm in this world for a reason": Resilience and recovery among American Indian and Alaska Native two-spirit women|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|date=June 2016|volume=20|issue=3–4|pages=352–371|doi=10.1080/10894160.2016.1152813|pmid=27254761}}&lt;/ref&gt; developing [[communication skills training|communications skills]], and the capacity to manage strong feelings and [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentsuccess.unc.edu/files/2015/08/The-Road-to-Resiliency.pdf |title=APA – Resilience Factors &amp; Strategies |publisher=unc.edu |accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temperamental and constitutional disposition is considered as a major factor in resilience. It is one of the necessary precursors of resilience along with warmth in family cohesion and accessibility of prosocial support systems.&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A. S., &amp; Reed, M. G. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Cr5rP8jOnsC&amp;pg=PA74 Resilience in development]. In C. R. Snyder, &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 74-88). London, England: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three kinds of temperamental systems that play part in resilience, they are the appetitive system, defensive system and attentional system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=DERRYBERRY | first=DOUGLAS | last2=REED | first2=MARJORIE A. | last3=PILKENTON–TAYLOR | first3=CAROLYN | title=Temperament and coping: Advantages of an individual differences perspective | journal=Development and Psychopathology | publisher=Cambridge University Press (CUP) | volume=15 | issue=04 | date=14 November 2003 | issn=0954-5794 | doi=10.1017/s0954579403000439 | pmid=14984137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another protective factor is related to moderating the negative effects of environmental hazards or a stressful situation in order to direct vulnerable individuals to optimistic paths, such as external social support. More specifically a 1995 study distinguished three contexts for protective factors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Werner | first1 = E. E. | year = 1995 | title = Resilience in development| journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 81–85 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.ep10772327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# personal attributes, including outgoing, bright, and positive [[self-concept]]s;
# the family, such as having close bonds with at least one family member or an emotionally stable parent; and
# the community, such as receiving support or counsel from peers.

Furthermore, a study of the elderly in Zurich, Switzerland, illuminated the role humor plays as a coping mechanism to maintain a state of happiness in the face of age-related adversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ruch | first1 = W. | last2 = Proyer | first2 = R. T. | last3 = Weber | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1007/s00391-009-0090-0 | title = Humor as a character strength among the elderly | journal = Zeitschrift für Gerontologie und Geriatrie | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–18 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20012063 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the above distinction on resilience, research has also been devoted to discovering the individual differences in resilience. [[Self-esteem]], ego-control, and ego-resiliency are related to behavioral adaptation.&lt;ref name=Ci1993&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cicchetti | first1 = D. | last2 = Rogosch | first2 = F. A. | last3 = Lynch | first3 = M. | last4 = Holt | first4 = K. D. | year = 1993 | title = Resilience in maltreated children: Processes leading to adaptive outcome | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 629–647 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579400006209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, maltreated children who feel good about themselves may process risk situations differently by attributing different reasons to the environments they experience and, thereby, avoid producing negative [[internalized]] [[self-perception]]s. Ego-control is "the threshold or operating characteristics of an individual with regard to the expression or containment"&lt;ref&gt;Block, J. H., &amp; Block, J. (1980). "The role of ego-control and ego-resiliency in the organisation of behaviour". In W. A. Collins (Ed.), ''Development of cognition, affect, and social relations: Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology '' (Vol. 13, p. 43). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|089859023X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of their impulses, feelings, and desires. Ego-resilience refers to "dynamic capacity, to modify his or her model level of ego-control, in either direction, as a function of the demand characteristics of the environmental context"&lt;ref&gt;Block, J. H., &amp; Block, J. (1980). "The role of ego-control and ego-resiliency in the organisation of behaviour". In W. A. Collins (Ed.), ''Development of cognition, affect, and social relations: Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology '' (Vol. 13, p. 48). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|089859023X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltreated children who experienced some risk factors (e.g., single parenting, limited maternal education, or family unemployment), showed lower ego-resilience and intelligence than nonmaltreated children. Furthermore, maltreated children are more likely than nonmaltreated children to demonstrate disruptive-aggressive, withdraw, and internalized behavior problems. Finally, ego-resiliency, and positive self-esteem were predictors of competent adaptation in the maltreated children.&lt;ref name=Ci1993/&gt;

Demographic information (e.g., gender) and resources (e.g., social support) are also used to predict resilience. Examining people's adaptation after disaster showed women were associated with less likelihood of resilience than men. Also, individuals who were less involved in affinity groups and organisations showed less resilience.&lt;ref name=Bonanno&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonanno | first1 = G. A. | last2 = Galea | first2 = S. | last3 = Bucciareli | first3 = A. | last4 = Vlahov | first4 = D. | year = 2007 | title = What predicts psychological resilience after disaster?

Certain aspects of religions and spirituality may, hypothetically, promote or hinder certain psychological virtues that increase resilience. Research has not established connection between spirituality and resilience. According to the 4th edition of ''Psychology of Religion'' by Hood, et al., the "study of positive psychology is a relatively new development...there has not yet been much direct empirical research looking specifically at the association of religion and ordinary strengths and virtues".&lt;ref&gt;Hood, R., Hill, P., Spilka, B., (2009) ''The psychology of religion, 4th edition: An empirical approach''. Newyork: The Guilford press, {{ISBN|1606233920}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the literature on the relationship between religiosity/spirituality and PTSD, amongst the significant findings, about half of the studies showed a positive relationship and half showed a negative relationship between measures of religiosity/spirituality and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peres | first1 = J. | last2 = Moreira-Almeida | first2 = A. | last3 = Nasello | first3 = A. | last4 = Koenig | first4 = H. | year = 2007 | title = Spirituality and resilience in trauma victims | journal = Journal of Religion &amp; Health | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 343–350 | doi = 10.1007/s10943-006-9103-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Army has received criticism for promoting spirituality in its new [Comprehensive Soldier Fitness] program as a way to prevent PTSD, due to the lack of conclusive supporting data.

In military studies it has been found that resilience is also dependent on group support: unit cohesion and morale is the best predictor of combat resiliency within a unit or organization. Resilience is highly correlated to peer support and group cohesion. Units with high cohesion tend to experience a lower rate of psychological breakdowns than units with low cohesion and morale. High cohesion and morale enhance adaptive stress reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Army (2009). Field Manual No. 6-22.5. Combat and Operational Stress Control Manual for Leaders and Soldiers. Department of the Army Headquarters, Washington, DC, 18 March 2009. p 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==

In [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], building resilience is a matter of mindfully changing basic behaviors and thought patterns.&lt;ref name="Padesky"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Padesky|first=Christine A.|last2=Mooney|first2=Kathleen A.|date=2012-06-01|title=Strengths-Based Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: A Four-Step Model to Build Resilience|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpp.1795|journal=Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=283–290|doi=10.1002/cpp.1795|issn=1063-3995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step is to change the nature of self-talk. Self-talk is the internal monologue people have that reinforce beliefs about the person's self-efficacy and self-value. To build resilience, the person needs to eliminate negative self-talk, such as "I can't do this" and "I can't handle this", and to replace it with positive self-talk, such as "I can do this" and "I can handle this". This small change in thought patterns helps to reduce psychological stress when a person is faced with a difficult challenge. The second step a person can take to build resilience is to be prepared for challenges, crises, and emergencies. In business, preparedness is created by creating emergency response plans, business continuity plans, and contingency plans. For personal preparedness, the individual can create a financial cushion to help with economic crises, he/she can develop social networks to help him/her through trying personal crises, and he/she can develop emergency response plans for his/her household.

Resilience is also enhanced by developing effective coping skills for stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chua|first=Li Wen|last2=Milfont|first2=Taciano L.|last3=Jose|first3=Paul E.|date=2014-11-27|title=Coping Skills Help Explain How Future-Oriented Adolescents Accrue Greater Well-Being Over Time|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-014-0230-8|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|language=en|volume=44|issue=11|pages=2028–2041|doi=10.1007/s10964-014-0230-8|issn=0047-2891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping skills help the individual to reduce stress levels, so they remain functional. Coping skills include using meditation, exercise, socialization, and self-care practices to maintain a healthy level of stress, but there are many other lists associated with psychological resilience.

The [[American Psychological Association]] suggests "10 Ways to Build Resilience",&lt;ref name="apa.org" /&gt; which are:

# to maintain good [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s with close family members, friends and others;
# to avoid seeing [[crisis|crises]] or [[Stress (biology)|stressful]] events as unbearable problems;
# to accept circumstances that cannot be changed;
# to develop realistic [[goal]]s and move towards them;
# to take decisive actions in adverse situations;
# to look for opportunities of self-discovery after a struggle with loss;
# to develop self-confidence;
# to keep a long-term perspective and consider the stressful event in a broader context;
# to maintain a hopeful outlook, expecting good things and [[Mental image|visualizing]] what is wished;
# to take care of one's [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]], [[physical exercise|exercising]] regularly, paying attention to one's own needs and feelings.

The Besht model of natural resilience building in an ideal family with positive access and support from family and friends, through parenting illustrates four key markers. They are:

# Realistic upbringing
# Effective risk communications
# Positivity and restructuring of demanding situations
# Building self efficacy and hardiness

In this model, [[self-efficacy]] is the belief in one's ability to organize and execute the courses of action required to achieve necessary and desired goals and [[Hardiness (psychological)|hardiness]] is a composite of interrelated attitudes of commitment, control, and challenge.

A number of self-help approaches to resilience-building have been developed, drawing mainly on the theory and practice of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) and [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] (REBT).&lt;ref name="Robertson_2012"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=Build your Resilience| year=2012| publisher=Hodder| location=London| isbn=978-1444168716|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwIstsEgkBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a group cognitive-behavioral intervention, called the Penn Resiliency Program (PRP), has been shown to foster various aspects of resilience. A meta-analysis of 17 PRP studies showed that the intervention significantly reduces depressive symptoms over time.&lt;ref name="pmid19968381"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brunwasser SM, Gillham JE, Kim ES.|title=A meta-analytic review of the Penn Resiliency Program's effect on depressive symptoms|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|year=2009|volume=77|issue=6|pages=1042–1054|doi=10.1037/a0017671|pmid=19968381|last2=Gillham|last3=Kim|pmc=4667774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of 'resilience building' is debatably at odds with the concept of resilience as a process,&lt;ref name="Rutter, M. 2008 pp. 3"&gt;Rutter, M. (2008). "Developing concepts in developmental psychopathology", pp. 3–22 in J.J. Hudziak (ed.), ''Developmental psychopathology and wellness: Genetic and environmental influences''. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing, {{ISBN|1585622796}}.&lt;/ref&gt; since it is used to imply that it is a developable characteristic of oneself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masten | first1 = A.

[[Bibliotherapy]], positive tracking of events, and enhancing psychosocial protective factors with positive psychological resources are other methods for resilience building.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, T. M., Egeland, B., &amp; Sroufe, L. A. (2003). "Rethinking resilience: A developmental process perspective", pp. 234–256 in S. S. Luthar (Ed.), ''Resilience and vulnerability: Adaptation in the context of childhood adversities''. New York: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521001617}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, increasing an individual's resources to cope with or otherwise address the negative aspects of risk or adversity is promoted, or builds, resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Resilience: Building immunity in psychiatry | pmc=3777343 | pmid=24082242 | doi=10.4103/0019-5545.117134 | volume=55 | issue=3 | year=2013 | journal=Indian J Psychiatry | pages=224–34 | last1 = Shastri | first1 = PC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting research finds that strategies to regulate and control emotions, in order to enhance resilience, allows for better outcomes in the event of mental illness.&lt;ref name=Min&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.comppsych.2013.05.008| pmid = 23806709| title = Cognitive emotion regulation strategies contributing to resilience in patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders| journal = Comprehensive Psychiatry| volume = 54| issue = 8| pages = 1190–7| year = 2013| last1 = Min | first1 = J.

H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; While initial studies of resilience originated with developmental scientists studying children in high-risk environments, a study on 230 adults diagnosed with depression and anxiety that emphasized emotional regulation, showed that it contributed to resilience in patients. These strategies focused on planning, positively reappraising events, and reducing rumination helped in maintaining a healthy continuity.&lt;ref name=Min/&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2016}} Patients with improved resilience were found to yield better treatment outcomes than patients with non-resilience focused treatment plans,&lt;ref name=Min/&gt; providing potential information for supporting evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions that may better handle mental disorders by focusing on the aspect of psychological resilience.

Military organizations test personnel for the ability to function under stressful circumstances by deliberately subjecting them to stress during training. Those students who do not exhibit the necessary resilience can be screened out of the training. Those who remain can be given stress inoculation training. The process is repeated as personnel apply for increasingly demanding positions, such as [[special forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Robson | first =Sean | author-link = | last2 =Manacapilli | first2 =Thomas | author2-link = | title =Enhancing Performance Under Stress: Stress Inoculation Training for Battlefield Airmen | place =Santa Monica, California | publisher =[[RAND Corporation]] | series = | volume = | orig-year = | year =2014 | month= | edition = | chapter = | chapter-url = | page = | pages =61 | language = | url =http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR700/RR750/RAND_RR750.pdf | doi = | id = | isbn =9780833078445 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==

Resilience in children refers to individuals who are doing better than expected, given a history that includes risk or adverse experience. Once again, it is not a trait or something that some children simply possess. There is no such thing as an 'invulnerable child' that can overcome any obstacle or adversity that he or she encounters in life—and in fact, the trait is quite common.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Resilience is the product of a number of developmental processes over time, that has allowed children experience small exposures to adversity or some sort of age appropriate challenges to develop mastery and continue to develop competently.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, T. M., Egeland, B., &amp; Sroufe, L. A. (2003). "Rethinking resilience: A developmental process perspective", pp. 234–256 in S. S. Luthar (Ed.), ''Resilience and vulnerability: Adaptation in the context of childhood adversities''. New York: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521001617}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This gives children a sense of personal pride and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven J. Wolin, M.D.|author2=Sybil Wolin, Ph.D.|title=The Resilient Self: How Survivors of Troubled Families Rise Above Adversity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UF3-Wjg4SoC|year=2010|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-75687-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on 'protective factors', which are characteristics of children or situations that particularly help children in the context of risk has helped developmental scientists to understand what matters most for resilient children. Two of these that have emerged repeatedly in studies of resilient children are good cognitive functioning (like cognitive self-regulation and IQ) and positive relationships (especially with competent adults, like parents).&lt;ref&gt;Luthar, S. S. (2006). "Resilience in development: A synthesis of research across five decades", pp. 739–795 in D. Cicchetti and D. J. Cohen (Eds.), ''Developmental Psychopathology (2nd ed.): Vol. 3 Risk, Disorder, and Adaptation''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who have protective factors in their lives tend to do better in some risky contexts when compared to children without protective factors in the same contexts. However, this is not a justification to expose any child to risk. Children do better when not exposed to high levels of risk or adversity.

===Building in the classroom===

Resilient children within classroom environments have been described as working and playing well and holding high expectations, have often been characterized using constructs such as [[locus of control]], [[self-esteem]], [[self-efficacy]], and [[autonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Garmezy, N. (1974, August) ''The study of children at risk: New perspectives for developmental psychopathology.''&lt;/ref&gt; All of these things work together to prevent the debilitating behaviors that are associated with [[learned helplessness]].

===Role of the community===
Communities play a huge role in fostering resilience. The clearest sign of a cohesive and supportive community is the presence of social organizations that provide healthy human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garmezy | first1 = N. | year = 1991 | title = Resiliency and vulnerability to adverse developmental outcomes associated with poverty | journal = American Behavioral Scientist | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 416–430 | doi = 10.1177/0002764291034004003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Services are unlikely to be used unless there is good communication concerning them. Children who are repeatedly [[Relocation (personal)|relocated]] do not benefit from these resources, as their opportunities for resilience-building, meaningful community participation are removed with every relocation.&lt;ref name="Emotional Adjustment of Moving for Young Kids"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moveboxer.com/content/pages/the-emotional-adjustment-of-moving-for-young-kids|title=Emotional Adjustment of Moving for Young Kids|last=Howard|first=Alyssa|publisher=Moveboxer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the family===

Fostering resilience in children requires family environments that are caring and stable, hold high expectations for children's behavior and encourage participation in the life of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Haertel, &amp; Walberg, M. C., G. D., &amp; H. J (Ed.). (1994). ''Educational Resilience in Inner Cities.'' Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Most resilient children have a strong relationship with at least one adult, not always a parent, and this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord. The definition of parental resilience, as the capacity of parents to deliver a competent and quality level of parenting to children, despite the presence of risk factors, has proven to be a very important role in children's resilience. Understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental resilience.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Even if divorce produces stress, the availability of social support from family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes.&lt;ref name="Benard, B. 1991"&gt;Benard, B. (1991) [https://archive.org/details/fosteringresilie00benarich ''Fostering resiliency in kids: Protective factors in the family, school and community.''] Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; Any family that emphasizes the value of assigned chores, caring for brothers or sisters, and the contribution of part-time work in supporting the family helps to foster resilience.&lt;ref name=w1989/&gt; Resilience research has traditionally focused on the well being of children, with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the resilience of parents.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Families in poverty===
Numerous studies have shown that some practices that poor parents utilize help promote resilience within families. These include frequent displays of warmth, affection, emotional support; reasonable expectations for children combined with straightforward, not overly harsh discipline; family routines and celebrations; and the maintenance of common values regarding money and leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Cauce, Ana Mari; Stewart, Angela; Rodriguez, Melanie D.; Cochran, Bryan; Ginzler, Joshua. (2003) "Overcoming the Odds? Adolescent Development in the Context of Urban Poverty", pp. 343–391 in Suniya S. Luthar (ed.), ''Resilience and Vulnerability: Adaptation in the Context of Childhood Adversities''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521001617}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist Christopher B. Doob, "Poor children growing up in resilient families have received significant support for doing well as they enter the social world—starting in daycare programs and then in schooling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher B.|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bullying===
{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence#Resilience}}

Beyond preventing [[bullying]], it is also important to consider how interventions based on emotional intelligence (EI) are important in the case that bullying does occur. Increasing EI may be an important step in trying to foster resilience among victims. When a person faces stress and adversity, especially of a repetitive nature, their ability to adapt is an important factor in whether they have a more positive or negative outcome.&lt;ref name=Brisa&gt;Monroy Cortés, B. G. &amp; Palacios Cruz, L. (2011) [http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=58220785008 Resiliencia: ¿Es posible medirla e influir en ella?] ''Salud Mental'', ''34''(3) 237–246. México: Instituto Nacional de Psiquiátrica Ramón de la Fuente Muñiz. {{ISSN|0185-3325}} [Spanish]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study examined adolescents who illustrated resilience to bullying and found some interesting gendered differences, with higher behavioral resilience found among girls and higher emotional resilience found among boys. Despite these differences, they still implicated internal resources and negative emotionality in either encouraging or being negatively associated with resilience to bullying respectively and urged for the targeting of psychosocial skills as a form of intervention.&lt;ref name=Sapouna&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.05.009| title = Resilience to bullying victimization: The role of individual, family and peer characteristics| journal = Child Abuse &amp; Neglect| volume = 37| issue = 11| pages = 997–1006| year = 2013| last1 = Sapouna | first1 = M. | last2 = Wolke | first2 = D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emotional intelligence]] has been illustrated to promote resilience to stress&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2013.07.460| title = Emotional intelligence and resilience| journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 55| issue = 8| pages = 909–914| year = 2013| last1 = Schneider | first1 = T.

(2013) found that emotional perception was significant in facilitating lower negative emotionality during stress and Emotional Understanding facilitated resilience and has a positive correlation with positive affect.&lt;ref name=Schneider /&gt;

==Studies in specific populations and causal situations==

===Affected populations===

====Among transgender youth====

Transgender youth experience a wide range of abuse and lack of understanding from the people in their environment and are better off with a high resilience to deal with their lives. A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, perceived social support, emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of resilience in determining how depressed the individuals were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aspects of Psychological Resilience among Transgender Youth|journal=LGBT Youth|date=8 April 2011|volume=8|issue=2|pages=103–115|doi=10.1080/19361653.2011.541347|last1=Grossman|first1=Arnold H.|last2=d'Augelli|first2=Anthony R.|last3=Frank|first3=John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among pregnant adolescents and depressive symptoms====

Pregnancies among adolescents are considered as a complication, as they favour education interruption, poor present and future health, higher rates of poverty, problems for present and future children, among other negative outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pérez-López FR, Chedraui P, Kravitz AS, Salazar-Pousada D, Hidalgo L |title= Present problems and controversies concerning pregnant adolescents|journal= Open Access Journal of Contraception |year=2011|volume=2 |pages=85–94|url= http://www.unizar.es/gine/adol.pdf|doi=10.2147/OAJC.S13398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators from the Ecuadorian Catholic University ([[Universidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil]]) (Guayaquil) and the Spanish [[University of Zaragoza]] (Zaragoza), performed a comparative study at the Enrique C. Sotomayor Obstetric and Gynecology Hospital (Guayaquil) assessing resilience differences between pregnant [[adolescents]] and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Salazar-Pousada | first1 = D. | last2 = Arroyo | first2 = D. | last3 = Hidalgo | first3 = L. | last4 = Pérez-López | first4 = F. R. | last5 = Chedraui | first5 = P. | title = Depressive Symptoms and Resilience among Pregnant Adolescents: A Case-Control Study | doi = 10.1155/2010/952493 | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology International | volume = 2010 | pages = 1–7 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21461335 | pmc =3065659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 56.6% of gravids presented total CESD-10 scores 10 or more indicating depressed mood. Despite this, total CESD-10 scores and depressed mood rate did not differ among studied groups. Adolescents did, however, display lower resilience reflected by lower total resilience scores and a higher rate of scores below the calculated median (P &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis could not establish any risk factor for depressed mood among studied subjects; however, having an adolescent partner and a preterm delivery related to a higher risk for lower resilience.

===Causal situations===

====Divorce====

Oftentimes divorce is viewed as detrimental to one's emotional health, but studies have shown that cultivating resilience may be beneficial to all parties involved. The level of resilience a child will experience after their parents have split is dependent on both internal and external variables. Some of these variables include their psychological and physical state and the level of support they receive from their schools, friends, and family friends.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"/&gt; The ability to deal with these situations also stems from the child's age, gender, and temperament. Children will experience divorce differently and thus their ability to cope with divorce will differ too. About 20–25% of children will "demonstrate severe emotional and behavioral problems" when going through a divorce.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"/&gt; This percentage is notably higher than the 10% of children exhibiting similar problems in married families.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1741-3729.2003.00352.x| title = Children's Adjustment Following Divorce: Risk and Resilience Perspectives| journal = Family Relations| volume = 52| issue = 4| pages = 352–362| year = 2003| last1 = Kelly | first1 = J. B. | last2 = Emery | first2 = R. E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having divorces parents of approximately 75–80% of these children will "develop into well-adjusted adults with no lasting psychological or behavioral problems". This comes to show that most children have the tools necessary to allow them to exhibit the resilience needed to overcome their parents' divorce.

The effects of the divorce extend past the separation of both parents. The remaining conflict between parents, financial problems, and the re-partnering or remarriage of parents can cause lasting stress.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"/&gt; Studies conducted by Booth and Amato (2001) have shown that there is no correlation between post-divorce conflict and the child's ability to adjust to their life circumstance.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"/&gt; On the other hand, Hetherington (1999) completed research on this same topic and did find adverse effects in children.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"/&gt; In regards to the financial standing of a family, divorce does have the potential to reduce the children's style of living. Child support is often given to help cover basic needs such as schooling. If the parents' finances are already scarce then their children may not be able to participate in extracurricular activities such as sports and music lessons, which can be detrimental to their social lives.

Repartnering or remarrying can bring in additional levels of conflict and anger into their home environment. One of the reasons that re-partnering causes additional stress is because of the lack of clarity in roles and relationships; the child may not know how to react and behave with this new "parent" figure in their life. In most cases, bringing in a new partner/spouse will be the most stressful when done shortly after the divorce. In the past, divorce had been viewed as a "single event", but now research shows that divorce encompasses multiple changes and challenges.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"/&gt; It is not only internal factors that allow for resiliency, but the external factors in the environment are critical for responding to the situation and adapting. Certain programs such as the 14-week Children's Support Group and the Children of Divorce Intervention Program may help a child cope with the changes that occur from a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.childrensinstitute.net/sites/default/files/documents/children-resilience-family-court-review.pdf|author=Pedro-Carroll, JA |title= Fostering children's resilience in the aftermath of divorce: The told of evidence based programs for children|journal= Family Court Review|volume=43|year=2005|pages=52–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Natural disasters====
Resilience after a natural disaster can be gauged in a number of different ways. It can be gauged on an individual level, a community level, and on a physical level. The first level, the individual level, can be defined as each independent person in the community. The second level, the community level, can be defined as all those inhabiting the locality affected. Lastly, the physical level can be defined as the infrastructure of the locality affected.&lt;ref name="ecologyandsociety.org"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.5751/ES-05377-180216|title=Education, Vulnerability, and Resilience after a Natural Disaster|journal=Ecology and Society|volume=18|issue=2|year=2013|last1=Frankenberg|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Sikoki|first2=Bondan|last3=Sumantri|first3=Cecep|last4=Suriastini|first4=Wayan|last5=Thomas|first5=Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCAP funded research on how communities show resiliency in the wake of natural disasters.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Theme Study on Building Resilience to Natural Disasters and Major Economic Crises|journal= Welcome to UN ESCAP. |url= http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/ThemeStudy2013-full2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that, physically, communities were more resilient if they banded together and made resiliency an effort of the whole community.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt; Social support is key in resilient behavior, and especially the ability to pool resources.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt; In pooling social, natural, and economic resources, they found that communities were more resilient and able to over come disasters much faster than communities with an individualistic mindset.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt;

The World Economic Forum met in 2014 to discuss resiliency after natural disasters. They conclude that countries that are more economically sound, and have more individuals with the ability to diversify their livelihoods, will show higher levels of resiliency.&lt;ref name="weforum.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Building Resilience to Natural Disasters|journal= The World Economic Forum. |url= http://www.weforum.org/sessions/summary/building-resilience-natural-disasters-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has not been studied in depth yet, but the ideas brought about through this forum appear to be fairly consistent with already existing research.&lt;ref name="weforum.org"/&gt;

====Death of a family member====

Little research has been done on the topic of family resilience in the wake of the death of a family member.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rynearson, Edward K. |title=Violent Death: Resilience and Intervention Beyond the Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WoRCPUeylLYC&amp;pg=PP1|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-135-92633-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, clinical attention to bereavement has focused on the individual mourning process rather than on those of the family unit as a whole. Resiliency is distinguished from recovery as the "ability to maintain a stable equilibrium"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bonanno|first1=George A.|title=Loss, Trauma, and Human Resilience|journal=American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|pages=20–8|pmid=14736317|year=2004|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is conducive to balance, harmony, and recovery. Families must learn to manage familial distortions caused by the death of the family member, which can be done by reorganizing relationships and changing patterns of functioning to adapt to their new situation.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Greeff|first1=Abraham P.|last2=Human|first2=Berquin|title=Resilience in families in which a parent has died|journal=The American Journal of Family Therapy|volume=32|pages=27–42|doi=10.1080/01926180490255765|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibiting resilience in the wake of trauma can successfully traverse the bereavement process without long-term negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2190/OM.61.1.b| title = Reactions to Loss Scale: Assessing Grief in College Students| journal = OMEGA – Journal of Death and Dying| volume = 61| pages = 25–51| year = 2010| last1 = Cooley | first1 = E.| last2 = Toray | first2 = T.| last3 = Roscoe | first3 = L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the healthiest behaviors displayed by resilient families in the wake of a death is honest and open communication. This facilitates an understanding of the crisis. Sharing the experience of the death can promote immediate and long-term adaptation to the recent loss of a loved one. Empathy is a crucial component in resilience because it allows mourners to understand other positions, tolerate conflict, and be ready to grapple with differences that may arise. Another crucial component to resilience is the maintenance of a routine that helps to bind the family together through regular contact and order. The continuation of education and a connection with peers and teachers at school is an important support for children struggling with the death of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Therapeutic Interventions to Strengthen Resilience in Vulnerable Children|journal=School Psychology International|volume=35|issue=3|pages=309–337|doi=10.1177/0143034314529912|year=2014|last1=Heath|first1=M. A.|last2=Donald|first2=D. R.|last3=Theron|first3=L. C.|last4=Lyon|first4=R. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Brad Evans and Julian Reid criticize resilience discourse and its rising popularity in their book, ''Resilient Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Brad|last2=Reid|first2=Julian|title=Resilient Life: The Art of Living Dangerously|date=2014|publisher=Polity Press|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-0-7456-7152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors assert that policies of resilience can put the onus of disaster response on individuals rather than publicly coordinated efforts. Tied to the emergence of [[neoliberalism]], [[climate change]] theory, third-world development, and other discourses, Evans and Reid argue that promoting resilience draws attention away from governmental responsibility and towards self-responsibility and healthy psychological affects such as "posttraumatic growth".

Another criticism regarding resilience is its definition. Like other psychological phenomena, by defining specific psychological and affective states in certain ways, controversy over meaning will always ensue. How the term resilience is defined affects research focuses; different or insufficient definitions of resilience will lead to inconsistent research about the same concepts. Research on resilience has become more heterogeneous in its outcomes and measures, convincing some researchers to abandon the term altogether due to it being attributed to all outcomes of research where results were more positive than expected.&lt;ref name=burt&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0954579412000119| pmid = 22559126| title = Resilience in the transition to adulthood| journal = Development and Psychopathology| volume = 24| issue = 2| pages = 493–505| year = 2012| last1 = Burt | first1 = K.

'''Robert T. Lackey''' (born 1944) is a Canadian born [[fisheries scientist]] and [[political scientist]] living in the United States.  He is best known for his work involving the interplay between science and policy, natural resource management, and assessments of the future of [[salmon run]]s.  Lackey is a professor of fisheries and wildlife and adjunct professor of political science at Oregon State University.&lt;ref&gt;Oregon State University (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1981-2008, he held senior leadership posts at the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] research laboratory in Corvallis, Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Robert Thomas Lackey received a B.S. (fisheries) from [[Humboldt State University]] (California) in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt State University (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  He then entered the Zoology graduate program at the [[University of Maine]] to study “Seasonal abundance and availability of [[forage fish]]es and their utilization by landlocked Atlantic salmon and brook trout in Echo Lake, Mount Desert Island, Maine“ under the advisement of Professor [[W. Harry Everhart]].  After obtaining an M.S. (Zoology) in 1968, Lackey enrolled in the graduate program at [[Colorado State University]] to pursue a doctorate.  His research on the “Effects of artificial destratification on a [[lake ecosystem]]“ was also supervised by Professor Everhart who had recently left the [[University of Maine]] to become head of the fisheries program at Colorado State University.  In 1971, Lackey was awarded a PhD (Fisheries and Wildlife) and was hired immediately by [[Virginia Tech]] ([[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]], [[Virginia]]) as an assistant professor of fisheries.  In 1973, he was promoted to Associate [[Professor]] at Virginia Tech.  In 1976-77, he spent a sabbatical year in [[Washington, D.C.]], working with the United States [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] Environment Program as the national program coordinator.  In 1977, he returned to Virginia Tech and resumed teaching and research.  He left Virginia Tech in 1979 to assume leadership of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s National Water Resources Analysis Group located in Leetown, [[West Virginia]].  In 1981, he accepted a job as senior biologist with the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] research laboratory in [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], [[Oregon]].  In 1982, he became Courtesy Professor in the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife at [[Oregon State University]], a position that he continues to hold.  Lackey’s career with the EPA laboratory in Corvallis included a variety of senior leadership posts, including Deputy Director, a position he held from 1989 to 2000.  In 1999, Lackey was awarded a senior [[Fulbright]] Fellowship and spend his tenure at the [[University of Northern British Columbia]] in [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]].&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  Lackey retired from the Environmental Protection Agency in 2008 to work at Oregon State University.

== Contributions ==

Lackey career evolved from his early focus on solving practical fisheries problems (improving fish yields using various novel habitat enhancement techniques) to his more recent efforts to better define the appropriate role of scientific information and scientists in natural resource policy.  Lackey’s leadership in developing policy options to restore wild salmon to the west coast of the United States is well known and controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Oregonian Newspaper (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been criticized for being overly pessimistic, but is regarded by others as a blunt assessor of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, he completed a 4-year collaborative effort, the Salmon 2100 Project.&lt;ref&gt;MSNBC (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  This project mobilized three dozen senior scientists and policy exports to develop practical policy options that, if implemented, would restore wild salmon runs in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and southern British Columbia.  The book of the same title was published in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;American Fisheries Society (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  He lectures widely advocating the view that scientists should be vigilant about keeping their personal policy preferences out of their scientific activities.&lt;ref&gt;Oregon State University (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also a proponent of the view that the pervasive use of [[normative science]] is undermining the credibility of the scientific enterprise.  His current work focuses on education, especially developing online graduate courses in ecological and natural resource policy.&lt;ref&gt;Oregon State University (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy''' (STXM) is a type of [[X-ray microscopy]] in which a zone plate focuses an X-ray beam onto a small spot, a sample is scanned in the focal plane of the [[zone plate]] and the transmitted X-ray intensity is recorded as a function of the sample position. A [[stroboscopic effect|stroboscopic]] scheme is used where the excitation is the pump and the synchrotron X-ray flashes are the probe.  X-ray microscopes work by exposing a film or [[Charge-coupled device|charged coupled device detector]] to detect X-rays that pass through the specimen. The image formed is of a thin section of specimen. Newer X-ray microscopes use [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy]] to heterogeneous materials at high spatial resolution. The essence of the technique is a combination of spectromicroscopy, imaging with spectral sensitivity, and microspectroscopy, recording spectra from very small spots.&lt;ref&gt;Koprinarov, Ivaylo, and Hitchcock, Adam P.. [http://unicorn.mcmaster.ca/stxm-intro/polySTXMintro-all.html "X-ray Spectromicroscopy of Polymers: An introduction for the non-specialist"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of STXM ==

=== Radiation damage ===
[[Electron energy loss spectroscopy]] (EELS) in combination with [[transmission electron microscopy]] has modest spectral resolution and is rather damaging to the sample material. STXM with variable X-ray energy gives high spectral resolution. Radiation damage effects are typically two orders of magnitude lower than for EELS. Radiation concerns are also relevant with organic materials.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1149041|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/71051/RSINAK-69-8-2964-1.pdf|title=A scanning transmission x-ray microscope for materials science spectromicroscopy at the advanced light source|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=69|issue=8|pages=2964|year=1998|last1=Warwick|first1=T.|last2=Franck|first2=K.|last3=Kortright|first3=J.

=== Samples with water ===
Unlike other methods such as electron microscopy, the spectra samples with water and carbon can be obtained.  STXM run at atmospheric pressure allows for convenient sample installation and fewer restrictions on sample preparation. Cells have even been built which can examine hydrated precipitates and solutions.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

== Operation ==
In order to obtain spectromicroscopy data the following operating procedure is followed. The desired [[monochromator]] grating is selected along with [[photon]] energy in the middle of NEXAFS range. Refocus mirrors are adjusted to put the beam into the microscope and steered to maximize the [[flux]] passing through the zone plate. A pinhole is placed in the photon beam upstream in a transverse position to maximize transmission. Pinhole size is determined by demagnification to the size of the [[diffraction]] limit of the zone plate lens. An undersized pinhole is often used to reduce intensity which controls radiation damage. The order sorting aperture is positioned to eliminate transmission of unfocused zero order light, which would blur the image. Then an x/y line scan is defined across an intensity variation in the image. The x/y line scans are repeated with varying focus conditions. [[Adsorption]] spectra can also be obtained with a stationary photon spot.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

== Applications ==
=== Quantitative polymer analysis ===

STXM has been used to study reinforce filler particles used in molded compressed [[polyurethane]] foams in the automotive and fishing industries to achieve higher load bearing capability. Two types of polymers, copolymer styrene and acrylonitrile (SAN) and aromatic-carbamate rich poly-isocyanate poly-addition (PIPA), are chemically indistinguishable by transmission electron spectroscopy. With NEXAFS, spectra of SAN and PIPA absorb strongly at 285.0 eV associated with the phenyl groups of the [[aromatic]] filler particles and thus show the same electron spectroscopy image. Only SAN has a strong absorption at 286.7 eV due to the acrylonitrile component. NEXAFS can be a quick and reliable means to differentiate chemical species at a sub-micron spatial scale.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

=== Distribution of macromolecular subcomponents of biofilm cells and matrix ===
STXM which uses near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy is able to be applied to fully hydrated biological molecules due to the ability of X-rays to penetrate water. Soft X-rays also provide spatial resolution better than 50&amp;nbsp;nm which is suitable for bacterial and bacterial microfilms. With this, [[Chemical imaging|quantitative chemical mapping]] at a spatial scale below 50&amp;nbsp;nm may be achieved. Soft X-rays also interact with almost all elements and allow mapping of chemical species based on bonding structure. STXM allows for study of a variety of questions regarding the nature, distribution, and role of protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and nucleic acid in biofilms, especially in the [[extracellular matrix]]. The study of these [[biofilms]] is useful for environmental remediation applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1128/AEM.69.9.5543-5554.2003 |pmid=12957944 |title=Scanning Transmission X-Ray, Laser Scanning, and Transmission Electron Microscopy Mapping of the Exopolymeric Matrix of Microbial Biofilms |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=5543-54 |year=2003 |last1=Lawrence |first1=J.

When the reference object is much bigger than the object to locate, the latter is often represented by a point. The reference object is often represented by a [[bounding box]]&lt;ref&gt; Hemakumara,  GPTS.  and  Rainis,  R.  2018.  Spatial  behaviour  modelling  of unauthorised housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka. KEMANUSIAAN  the  Asian  Journal  of  Humanities25(2): 91–107, https://doi.org/10.21315/kajh2018.25.2.5 

Spatial Behaviour Modelling of Unauthorised Housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka | Request PDF. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327864214_Spatial_Behaviour_Modelling_of_Unauthorised_Housing_in_Colombo_Sri_Lanka [accessed Sep 27 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[Anatomical terms of location|Anatomy]] it might be the case that a spatial relation is not fully applicable. Thus, the degree of applicability is defined which specifies from 0 till 100% how strongly a spatial relation holds. Often researchers concentrate on defining the applicability function for various spatial relations.

In [[spatial database]]s and [[Geospatial topology]] the ''spatial relations'' are used for ''spatial analysis'' and constraint specifications.

In [[cognitive development]] for walk and for catch objects, or [[Water-level task|for understand objects-behaviour]]; in [[Automated Guided Vehicle#Natural Features Navigation|robotic Natural Features Navigation]]; and many other areas, ''spatial relations'' plays a central role.

Commonly used types of ''spatial relations'' are: ''topological'', ''directional'' and ''distance'' relations.

== Topological relations ==
[[File:TopologicSpatialRelarions2.png|thumb|400px|Examples of topological spatial relations.]]
:&lt;small&gt;Main article [[DE-9IM#Spatial predicates|DE-9IM]].&lt;/small&gt;

The [[DE-9IM]] model expresses important ''space relations'' which are invariant to [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]], [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]] transformations.

For any two spatial objects ''a'' and ''b'', that can be points, lines and/or polygonal areas, there are 9 relations derived from ''DE-9IM'':
{| class="wikitable"
!valign="top"|''Equals''
| ''a'' = ''b''&lt;br/&gt;Topologically [[Equality (relational operator)|equal]].  Also (''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''a'') ∧ (''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''b'')

|-
!valign="top"|''Disjoint''
|''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ∅ &lt;br/&gt; ''a'' and ''b'' are disjoint, have no point in common. They form a set of  [[Disconnected (topology)#Disconnected spaces|disconnected]] geometries.

|-
!valign="middle"|''Intersects'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a'' ∩ ''b'' ≠ ∅

|-
!valign="top"|''Touches''
|(''a'' ∩ ''b'' ≠ ∅) ∧ (''a''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; ∩ ''b''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; = ∅) &lt;br/&gt; ''a'' touches ''b'', they have at least one boundary point in common, but no interior points.

|-
!valign="top"|''Contains''
|''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''b''

|-
!valign="top"|''Covers''
|''a''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; ∩ ''b'' = ''b'' &lt;br/&gt; ''b'' lies in the interior of ''a'' (extends ''Contains''). Other definitions: "no points of ''b'' lie in the exterior of ''a''", or "Every point of ''b'' is a point of (the interior of) ''a''".

|-
!valign="middle"|''CoveredBy''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
|''Covers(b,a)''

|-
!valign="top"|''Within'' 
|''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''a''
|}

== Directional relations ==
Directional relations can again be differentiated into external directional relations and internal directional relations. An internal directional relation specifies where an object is located inside the reference object while an external relations specifies where the object is located outside of the reference objects.

*Examples for internal directional relations: left; on the back; athwart, abaft
*Examples for external directional relations: on the right of; behind; in front of, abeam, astern

== Distance relations ==
Distance relations specify how far is the object away from the reference object.
*Examples are: at; nearby; in the vicinity; far away

== Relations by class ==
Reference objects represented by a [[bounding box]] or another kind of "spatial envelope" that encloses its borders, can be denoted with the maximum number of [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensions]] of this envelope:  &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; for [[Point (geometry)|punctual objects]], &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; for [[Line (geometry)|linear objects]], &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt; for [[area|planar objects]], &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt; for [[volume|volumetric objects]]. So, any object, in a [[2D geometric model|2D modeling]], can by  classified as ''point'', ''line'' or ''area'' according to its delimitation. Then, a ''type of spatial relation'' can be expressed by the class of the objects that participate in the relation:

* [[Spatial relation/point-point|point-point relations]]: ...
* [[Spatial relation/point-line|point-line relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/point-area|point-area relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/line-line|line-line relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/line-area|line-area relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/area-area|area-area relations]]:

More ''complex'' modeling schemas can represent an object as a composition of ''simple sub-objects''. Examples: represent in a [[astronomical map]] a star by a ''point'' and a [[binary star]] by ''two points'';  represent in [[geographical map]] a river with a ''line'', for its  [[river source|source]] [[stream]], and with an strip-''area'', for the rest of the river.  These schemas can use the above classes, uniform composition classes (''multi-point'', ''multi-line'' and ''multi-area'') and heterogeneous composition (''points''+''lines'' as "object of dimension 1", ''points''+''lines''+''areas'' as "object of dimension 2").

Two internal components of a ''complex object'' can express (the above) [[Binary operation|binary relations]] between them, and [[Ternary operation|ternary relations]], using the  whole object as a [[frame of reference]]. Some relations can be expressed by an abstract component, such the [[center of mass]] of the binary star, or a center line of the river.

== Temporal references ==
For human thinking, spatial relations include qualities like size, distance, volume, order, and, also, time:
{{Quotation|
Time is spatial: it requires understanding ordered sequences such as days of the week, months of the year, and seasons. A person with spatial difficulties may have problems understanding “yesterday,” “last week,” and “next month”. 
Time expressed digitally is just as spatial as time expressed by moving clock hands, but digital clocks remove the need to translate the hand position into numbers.
|Stockdale and Possin}}
Stockdale and Possin&lt;ref&gt;C. Stockdale and C. Possin (1998) [http://impactofspecialneeds.weebly.com/uploads/3/4/1/9/3419723/spatial.pdf Spatial Relations and Learning].&lt;/ref&gt;  discusses the many ways in which people with difficulty establishing spatial and temporal relationships can face problems in ordinary situations.

A {{convert|4|kg|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; one-third scale model of Sputnik 1, Sputnik 41 was deployed from the [[Mir]] [[space station]] on 10 November 1998.&lt;ref name="JSR380"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/jsr/back/news.380|title=Issue 380|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|work=Jonathan's Space Report|date=26 November 1998|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November, a fortnight after deployment, Sputnik 41 was in a [[low Earth orbit]] with a perigee of {{convert|339|km}}, an apogee of {{convert|352|km}}, an inclination of 51.6 degrees, and a period of 91.44 minutes.&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|work=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite was given the [[International Designator]] 1998-062C, and was [[Satellite Catalog Number|catalogued]] by the [[United States Space Command]] as 25533. Having ceased operations on 11 December 1998 after its batteries expired, Sputnik 41 decayed from orbit on 11 January 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_sputnik_41.html|title=Sputnik 41|publisher=TBS|work=The Satellite Encyclopedia|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sputnik 41 was originally intended to be built aboard Mir, based on a satellite launched in October 1997 as a backup for [[Sputnik 40]]. That spacecraft had been stored aboard the space station for a year after the successful deployment of Sputnik 40, and it was intended that it would be fitted with upgraded electronics and deployed. By the time of launch, the project had grown to involve a complete satellite, and the Sputnik 40 backup was never deployed.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

'''Stephen Blackmore''' [[CBE]] [[FRSE]] [[Royal Society of Biology|FRSB]] [[Fellow of the Linnean Society|FLS]] (born 30 July 1952) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[botanist]], who was educated at [[St George's School, Hong Kong|St. George's School]], [[Hong Kong]] and the [[University of Reading]] where he completed his PhD in 1976.

In physics, the '''twin paradox''' is a [[thought experiment]] in [[special relativity]] involving identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin sees the other twin as moving, and so, according to an incorrect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Modern Revolution in Physics |edition=illustrated |first1=Benjamin |last1=Crowell |publisher=Light and Matter |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-9704670-6-5 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMs-_JK-wncC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=OMs-_JK-wncC&amp;pg=PA23 Extract of page 23]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Physics |edition=3rd |first1=Raymond A. |last1=Serway |first2=Clement J. |last2=Moses |first3=Curt A. |last3=Moyer |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-111-79437-8 |page=21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTM8AAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=uTM8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 Extract of page 21]&lt;/ref&gt; and naive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Special Relativity to Feynman Diagrams: A Course of Theoretical Particle Physics for Beginners |edition=illustrated |first1=Riccardo |last1=D'Auria |first2=Mario |last2=Trigiante |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2011 |isbn=978-88-470-1504-3 |page=541 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-qIh6kd8d0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=R-qIh6kd8d0C&amp;pg=PA541 Extract of page 541]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gravitation and Spacetime |edition=3rd |first1=Hans C. |last1=Ohanian |first2=Remo |last2=Ruffini |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-139-61954-7 |page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVQhAwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=JVQhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176 Extract of page 176]&lt;/ref&gt; application of [[time dilation]] and the [[principle of relativity]], each should paradoxically find the other to have aged less. However, this scenario can be resolved within the standard framework of special relativity: the travelling twin's trajectory involves two different inertial frames, one for the outbound journey and one for the inbound journey, and so there is no symmetry between the spacetime paths of the twins. Therefore, the twin paradox is not a [[paradox]] in the sense of a logical contradiction. 

Starting with [[Paul Langevin]] in 1911, there have been various explanations of this paradox. These explanations "can be grouped into those that focus on the effect of different standards of simultaneity in different frames, and those that designate the acceleration [experienced by the travelling twin] as the main reason".&lt;ref name='Debs_Redhead'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Debs, Talal A. |author2=Redhead, Michael L.G. |title=The twin "paradox" and the conventionality of simultaneity |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=64 |issue=4 |year=1996 |pages=384–392 |doi=10.1119/1.18252 |bibcode=1996AmJPh..64..384D}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max von Laue]] argued in 1913 that since the traveling twin must be in two separate [[inertial frames]], one on the way out and another on the way back, this frame switch is the reason for the aging difference, not the acceleration ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Miller, Arthur I. |year=1981 |title=Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity.

==History==
{{further|History of special relativity#Time dilation and twin paradox}}
In his famous paper on [[special relativity]] in 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] deduced that when two [[clock]]s were brought together and synchronized, and then one was moved away and brought back, the clock which had undergone the traveling would be found to be lagging behind the clock which had stayed put.&lt;ref group=A&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Einstein, Albert |title=On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=17 |pages=891 (end of §4)|year=1905 |url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/ |bibcode=1905AnP...322..891E |doi=10.1002/andp.19053221004 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein considered this to be a natural consequence of special relativity, not a [[paradox]] as some suggested, and in 1911, he restated and elaborated on this result as follows (with physicist [[Robert Resnick]]'s comments following Einstein's):&lt;ref group=A&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Einstein, Albert |title=Die Relativitäts-Theorie |journal=Naturforschende Gesellschaft, Zürich, Vierteljahresschrift |volume=56 |pages=1–14 |year=1911 |url=https://archive.org/details/vierteljahrsschr56natu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Whitrow]], ''The Natural Philosophy of Time'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1961), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If we placed a living organism in a box ... one could arrange that the organism, after any arbitrary lengthy flight, could be returned to its original spot in a scarcely altered condition, while corresponding organisms which had remained in their original positions had already long since given way to new generations. For the moving organism, the lengthy time of the journey was a mere instant, provided the motion took place with approximately the speed of light.

If the stationary organism is a man and the traveling one is his twin, then the traveler returns home to find his twin brother much aged compared to himself. The paradox centers on the contention that, in relativity, either twin could regard the other as the traveler, in which case each should find the other younger—a logical contradiction. This contention assumes that the twins' situations are symmetrical and interchangeable, an assumption that is not correct. Furthermore, the accessible experiments have been done and support Einstein's prediction.}}

In 1911, [[Paul Langevin]] gave a "striking example" by describing the story of a traveler making a trip at a [[Lorentz factor]] of {{nowrap|''γ'' {{=}} 100}} (99.995% the speed of light). The traveler remains in a projectile for one year of his time, and then reverses direction. Upon return, the traveler will find that he has aged two years, while 200 years have passed on Earth. During the trip, both the traveler and Earth keep sending signals to each other at a constant rate, which places Langevin's story among the Doppler shift versions of the twin paradox. The relativistic effects upon the signal rates are used to account for the different aging rates. The asymmetry that occurred because only the traveler underwent acceleration, is used to explain why there is any difference at all, because "any change of velocity, or any acceleration has an absolute meaning".&lt;ref group=A&gt;{{citation |first = P. |last = Langevin |author-link = Paul Langevin

[[Max von Laue]] (1911, 1913) elaborated on Langevin's explanation. Using [[Hermann Minkowski]]'s [[spacetime]] formalism, Laue went on to demonstrate that the [[world line]]s of the inertially moving bodies maximize the [[proper time]] elapsed between two events. He also wrote that the asymmetric aging is completely accounted for by the fact that the astronaut twin travels in two separate frames, while the Earth twin remains in one frame, and the time of acceleration can be made arbitrarily small compared with the time of inertial motion.&lt;ref group=A name="Laue1913"&gt;{{cite journal |last=von Laue |first=Max |authorlink=Max von Laue |title=Zwei Einwände gegen die Relativitätstheorie und ihre Widerlegung ([[s:Translation:Two Objections Against the Theory of Relativity and their Refutation|Two Objections Against the Theory of Relativity and their Refutation]]) |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=13 |year=1911 |pages=118–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;{{cite book |last=von Laue |first=Max |title=Das Relativitätsprinzip ([[s:Translation:The Principle of Relativity (Laue 1913)|The Principle of Relativity]]) |edition=2 |year=1913 |publisher=[[w:de:Vieweg Verlag|Friedrich Vieweg]] |location=Braunschweig, Germany |oclc=298055497}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;{{cite journal |last=von Laue |first=Max |title=Das Relativitätsprinzip ([[s:Translation:The Principle of Relativity (Laue, Philosophy)|The Principle of Relativity]]) |journal=Jahrbücher der Philosophie |volume=1 |year=1913 |pages=99–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Lord Halsbury and others removed any acceleration by introducing the "three-brother" approach. The traveling twin transfers his clock reading to a third one, traveling in the opposite direction. Another way of avoiding acceleration effects is the use of the relativistic Doppler effect (see [[#What_it_looks_like:_the_relativistic_Doppler_shift|What it looks like: the relativistic Doppler shift]] below).

Neither Einstein nor Langevin considered such results to be problematic: Einstein only called it "peculiar" while Langevin presented it as a consequence of absolute acceleration.&lt;ref group=A&gt;"We are going to see this absolute character of the acceleration manifest itself in another form." ("Nous allons voir se manifester sous une autre forme ce caractère absolu de l'accélération."), page 82 of Langevin1911&lt;/ref&gt; Both men argued that, from the time differential illustrated by the story of the twins, no self-contradiction could be constructed. In other words, neither Einstein nor Langevin saw the story of the twins as constituting a challenge to the self-consistency of relativistic physics.

==Specific example==
Consider a space ship traveling from Earth to the nearest star system: a distance {{nowrap|''d'' {{=}} 4 light}} years away, at a speed {{nowrap|''v'' {{=}} 0.8''c''}} (i.e., 80 percent of the speed of light).

To make the numbers easy, the ship is assumed to attain full speed in a negligible time upon departure (even though it would actually take close to a year accelerating at [[Standard gravity|1&amp;nbsp;''g'']] to get up to speed). Similarly, at the end of the outgoing trip, the change in direction needed to start the return trip is assumed to occur in a negligible time.

The Earth-based mission control reasons about the journey this way: the round trip will take {{nowrap|''t'' {{=}} 2''d''/''v'' {{=}} 10 years}} in Earth time (''i.e.'' everybody on Earth will be 10 years older when the ship returns). The amount of time as measured on the ship's clocks and the aging of the travelers during their trip will be reduced by the factor &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \scriptstyle{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, the reciprocal of the [[Lorentz factor]] ([[time dilation]]). In this case {{nowrap|''ε'' {{=}} 0.6}} and the travelers will have aged only {{nowrap|0.6 × 10 {{=}} 6 years}} when they return.

=== Travellers' perspective ===
The ship's crew members also calculate the particulars of their trip from their perspective. They know that the distant star system and the Earth are moving relative to the ship at speed ''v'' during the trip. In their rest frame the distance between the Earth and the star system is {{nowrap|''εd'' {{=}} 0.6 × 4 {{=}} 2.4 light}} years ([[length contraction]]), for both the outward and return journeys. Each half of the journey takes {{nowrap|''εd'' / ''v'' {{=}} 2.4 / 0.8 {{=}} 3 years}}, and the round trip takes twice as long (6 years). Their calculations show that they will arrive home having aged 6&amp;nbsp;years. The travelers' final calculation about their aging is in complete agreement with the calculations of those on Earth, though they experience the trip quite differently from those who stay at home.

No matter what method they use to predict the clock readings, everybody will agree about them. If twins are born on the day the ship leaves, and one goes on the journey while the other stays on Earth, they will meet again when the traveler is 6&amp;nbsp;years old and the stay-at-home twin is 10&amp;nbsp;years old.

==Resolution of the paradox in special relativity==

The paradoxical aspect of the twins' situation arises from the fact that at any given moment the travelling twin's clock is running slow in the earthbound twin's inertial frame, but based on the relativity principle one could equally argue that the earthbound twin's clock is running slow in the travelling twin's inertial frame.&lt;ref name='Ohanian'&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohanian|first=Hans|title=Special relativity: a modern introduction|date=2001|publisher=Physics Curriculum and Instruction|location=Lakeville, MN|isbn=0971313415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Harris'&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Randy|title=Modern Physics|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Addison-Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=0805303081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Rindler'&gt;{{cite book|last=Rindler|first=W|title=Introduction to special relativity|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=9780198567318}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed resolution is based on the fact that the earthbound twin is at rest in the same inertial frame throughout the journey, while the travelling twin is not: in the simplest version of the thought-experiment, the travelling twin switches at the midpoint of the trip from being at rest in an inertial frame which moves in one direction (away from the Earth) to being at rest in an inertial frame which moves in the opposite direction (towards the Earth). In this approach, determining which observer switches frames and which does not is crucial. Although both twins can legitimately claim that they are at rest in their own frame, only the traveling twin experiences acceleration when the spaceship engines are turned on. This acceleration, measurable with an accelerometer, makes his rest frame temporarily non-inertial. This reveals a crucial asymmetry between the twins's perspectives: although we can predict the aging difference from both perspectives, we need to use different methods to obtain correct results.

===Role of acceleration===
Although some solutions attribute a crucial role to the acceleration of the travelling twin at the time of the turnaround,&lt;ref name='Ohanian'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Harris'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Rindler'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Weidner'&gt;{{cite book|last=Weidner|first=Richard|title=Physics|date=1985|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Needham Heights, MA|isbn=0205111556}}&lt;/ref&gt; others note that the effect also arises if one imagines separate outward-going and inward-coming travellers, who pass each other and synchronize their clocks at the point corresponding to "turnaround" of a single traveller. In this version, physical acceleration of the travelling clock plays no direct role;&lt;ref name="Einstein, A. 1923 pp. 38"&gt;Einstein, A., Lorentz, H.A., Minkowski, H., and Weyl, H. (1923).

===Relativity of simultaneity===
[[Image:Twin Paradox Minkowski Diagram.svg|thumb|right|333px|[[Minkowski diagram]] of the twin paradox. There is a difference between the trajectories of the twins: the trajectory of the ship is equally divided between two different inertial frames, while the Earth-based twin stays in the same inertial frame.]]
For a moment-by-moment understanding of how the time difference between the twins unfolds, one must understand that in special relativity there is no concept of ''absolute present''. For different inertial frames there are different sets of events that are simultaneous in that frame. This [[relativity of simultaneity]] means that switching from one inertial frame to another requires an adjustment in what slice through spacetime counts as the "present". In the spacetime diagram on the right, drawn for the reference frame of the Earth-based twin, that twin's world line coincides with the vertical axis (his position is constant in space, moving only in time). On the first leg of the trip, the second twin moves to the right (black sloped line); and on the second leg, back to the left. Blue lines show the planes of simultaneity for the traveling twin during the first leg of the journey; red lines, during the second leg. Just before turnaround, the traveling twin calculates the age of the Earth-based twin by measuring the interval along the vertical axis from the origin to the upper blue line. Just after turnaround, if he recalculates, he will measure the interval from the origin to the lower red line. In a sense, during the U-turn the plane of simultaneity jumps from blue to red and very quickly sweeps over a large segment of the world line of the Earth-based twin. When one transfers from the outgoing inertial frame to the incoming inertial frame there is a jump discontinuity in the age of the Earth-based twin&lt;ref name='Ohanian'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Harris'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Kogut'/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheeler, J. 1992 pp. 38, 170"&gt;Wheeler, J., Taylor, E. (1992). ''Spacetime Physics, second edition.'' W. H. Freeman: New York, pp. 38, 170-171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Einstein et al 1923"&gt;Einstein, A., Lorentz, H.A., Minkowski, H., and Weyl, H. (1923). Arnold Sommerfeld. ed. ''The Principle of Relativity.'' Dover Publications: Mineola, NY. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; (6.4 years in the [[#Specific example|example]] above).

==A non space-time approach==
As mentioned above, an "out and back" twin paradox adventure may incorporate the transfer of clock reading from an "outgoing" astronaut to an "incoming" astronaut, thus entirely eliminating the effect of acceleration. Also, according to the so-called "clock postulate", physical acceleration of clocks doesn't contribute to the [[kinematical]] effects of special relativity. Rather, the time differential between two reunited clocks is produced purely by uniform [[inertial motion]], as discussed in Einstein's original 1905 relativity paper,&lt;ref name="Einstein, A. 1923 pp. 38"/&gt; as well as in all subsequent kinematical derivations of the Lorentz transformations.

Because spacetime diagrams incorporate Einstein's clock synchronization (with its lattice of clocks methodology), there will be a requisite jump in the reading of the Earth clock time made by a "suddenly returning astronaut" who inherits a "new meaning of simultaneity" in keeping with a new clock synchronization dictated by the transfer to a different inertial frame, as explained in Spacetime Physics by John A. Wheeler.&lt;ref name="Wheeler, J. 1992 pp. 38, 170"/&gt;

If, instead of incorporating Einstein's clock synchronization (lattice of clocks), the astronaut (outgoing and incoming) and the Earth-based party regularly update each other on the status of their clocks by way of sending radio signals (which travel at light speed), then all parties will note an incremental buildup of asymmetry in time-keeping, beginning at the "turn around" point. Prior to the "turn around", each party regards the other party's clock to be recording time differently from his own, but the noted difference is symmetrical between the two parties. After the "turn around", the noted differences are not symmetrical, and the asymmetry grows incrementally until the two parties are reunited. Upon finally reuniting, this asymmetry can be seen in the actual difference showing on the two reunited clocks.&lt;ref&gt;William Geraint Vaughan Rosser (1991). Introductory Special Relativity, Taylor &amp; Francis Inc. USA, pp. 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The equivalence of biological aging and clock time-keeping==
All processes—chemical, biological, measuring apparatus functioning, human perception involving the eye and brain, the communication of force—are constrained by the speed of light. There is clock functioning at every level, dependent on light speed and the inherent delay at even the atomic level. Biological aging, therefore, is in no way different from clock time-keeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spacetime Physics |edition=2nd, illustrated |first1=Edwin F. |last1=Taylor |first2=John Archibald |last2=Wheeler |publisher=W. H. Freeman |year=1992  |isbn=978-0-7167-2327-1 |page=150 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDA8YcvMc_QC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that biological aging would be slowed in the same manner as a clock.

==What it looks like: the relativistic Doppler shift==

In view of the frame-dependence of simultaneity for events at different locations in space, some treatments prefer a more phenomenological approach, describing what the twins would observe if each sent out a series of regular radio pulses, equally spaced in time according to the emitter's clock.&lt;ref name='Kogut'/&gt; This is equivalent to asking, if each twin sent a video feed of themselves to each other, what do they see in their screens? Or, if each twin always carried a clock indicating his age, what time would each see in the image of their distant twin and his clock?

Shortly after departure, the traveling twin sees the stay-at-home twin with no time delay. At arrival, the image in the ship screen shows the staying twin as he was 1&amp;nbsp;year after launch, because radio emitted from Earth 1&amp;nbsp;year after launch gets to the other star 4&amp;nbsp;years afterwards and meets the ship there. During this leg of the trip, the traveling twin sees his own clock advance 3&amp;nbsp;years and the clock in the screen advance 1&amp;nbsp;year, so it seems to advance at {{frac|3}} the normal rate, just 20&amp;nbsp;image seconds per ship minute. This combines the effects of time dilation due to motion (by factor ε=0.6, five years on earth are 3&amp;nbsp;years on ship) and the effect of increasing light-time-delay (which grows from 0 to 4&amp;nbsp;years).

Of course, the observed frequency of the transmission is also {{frac|3}} the frequency of the transmitter (a reduction in frequency; "red-shifted"). This is called the [[relativistic Doppler effect]]. The frequency of clock-ticks (or of wavefronts) which one sees from a source with rest frequency ''f''&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;f_\mathrm{obs} = f_\mathrm{rest}\sqrt{\left({1 - v/c}\right)/\left({1 + v/c}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
when the source is moving directly away. This is ''f''&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; = {{frac|3}}''f''&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt; for ''v''/''c'' = 0.8.

As for the stay-at-home twin, he gets a slowed signal from the ship for 9&amp;nbsp;years, at a frequency {{frac|3}} the transmitter frequency. During these 9&amp;nbsp;years, the clock of the traveling twin in the screen seems to advance 3&amp;nbsp;years, so both twins see the image of their sibling aging at a rate only {{frac|3}} their own rate. Expressed in other way, they would both see the other's clock run at {{frac|3}} their own clock speed. If they factor out of the calculation the fact that the light-time delay of the transmission is increasing at a rate of 0.8&amp;nbsp;seconds per second, ''both'' can work out that the other twin is aging slower, at 60% rate.

Then the ship turns back toward home. The clock of the staying twin shows "1&amp;nbsp;year after launch" in the screen of the ship, and during the 3&amp;nbsp;years of the trip back it increases up to "10&amp;nbsp;years after launch", so the clock in the screen seems to be advancing 3&amp;nbsp;times faster than usual.

When the source is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency is higher ("blue-shifted") and given by
:&lt;math&gt;f_\mathrm{obs} = f_\mathrm{rest}\sqrt{\left({1 + v/c}\right)/\left({1 - v/c}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
This is ''f''&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; = 3''f''&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt; for ''v''/''c'' = 0.8.

As for the screen on Earth, it shows that trip back beginning 9&amp;nbsp;years after launch, and the traveling clock in the screen shows that 3&amp;nbsp;years have passed on the ship. One year later, the ship is back home and the clock shows 6&amp;nbsp;years. So, during the trip back, ''both'' twins see their sibling's clock going 3&amp;nbsp;times faster than their own. Factoring out the fact that the light-time-delay is decreasing by 0.8&amp;nbsp;seconds every second, each twin calculates that the other twin is aging at 60% his own aging speed.

[[Image:rstd4.gif|thumb|left|Light paths for images exchanged during trip&lt;br&gt;Left: Earth to ship. Right: Ship to Earth.&lt;br&gt;
Red lines indicate low frequency images are received, blue lines indicate high frequency images are received&lt;/div&gt;]]
The ''x''–''t'' (space–time) diagrams at left show the paths of light signals traveling between Earth and ship (1st diagram) and between ship and Earth (2nd diagram). These signals carry the images of each twin and his age-clock to the other twin. The vertical black line is the Earth's path through spacetime and the other two sides of the triangle show the ship's path through spacetime (as in the Minkowski diagram above). As far as the sender is concerned, he transmits these at equal intervals (say, once an hour) according to his own clock; but according to the clock of the twin receiving these signals, they are not being received at equal intervals.

After the ship has reached its cruising speed of 0.8''c'', each twin would see 1&amp;nbsp;second pass in the received image of the other twin for every 3&amp;nbsp;seconds of his own time. That is, each would see the image of the other's clock going slow, not just slow by the ''ε'' factor 0.6, but even slower because light-time-delay is increasing 0.8&amp;nbsp;seconds per second. This is shown in the figures by red light paths. At some point, the images received by each twin change so that each would see 3&amp;nbsp;seconds pass in the image for every second of his own time. That is, the received signal has been increased in frequency by the Doppler shift. These high frequency images are shown in the figures by blue light paths.

===The asymmetry in the Doppler shifted images===
The asymmetry between the Earth and the space ship is manifested in this diagram by the fact that more blue-shifted (fast aging) images are received by the ship. Put another way, the space ship sees the image change from a red-shift (slower aging of the image) to a blue-shift (faster aging of the image) at the midpoint of its trip (at the turnaround, 5&amp;nbsp;years after departure); the Earth sees the image of the ship change from red-shift to blue shift after 9&amp;nbsp;years (almost at the end of the period that the ship is absent). In the next section, one will see another asymmetry in the images: the Earth twin sees the ship twin age by the same amount in the red and blue shifted images; the ship twin sees the Earth twin age by different amounts in the red and blue shifted images.

==Calculation of elapsed time from the Doppler diagram==
The twin on the ship sees low frequency (red) images for 3 years. During that time, he would see the Earth twin in the image grow older by {{nowrap|3/3 {{=}} 1 years}}. He then sees high frequency (blue) images during the back trip of 3&amp;nbsp;years. During that time, he would see the Earth twin in the image grow older by {{nowrap|3 × 3 {{=}} 9 years.}} When the journey is finished, the image of the Earth twin has aged by {{nowrap|1 + 9 {{=}} 10 years.}}

The Earth twin sees 9 years of slow (red) images of the ship twin, during which the ship twin ages (in the image) by {{nowrap|9/3 {{=}} 3 years.}} He then sees fast (blue) images for the remaining 1&amp;nbsp;year until the ship returns. In the fast images, the ship twin ages by {{nowrap|1 × 3 {{=}} 3 years.}} The total aging of the ship twin in the images received by Earth is {{nowrap|3 + 3 {{=}} 6 years}}, so the ship twin returns younger (6&amp;nbsp;years as opposed to 10&amp;nbsp;years on Earth).

===The distinction between what they see and what they calculate===
To avoid confusion, note the distinction between what each twin sees and what each would calculate. Each sees an image of his twin which he knows originated at a previous time and which he knows is Doppler shifted. He does not take the elapsed time in the image as the age of his twin now.
*If he wants to calculate when his twin was the age shown in the image (''i.e.'' how old he himself was then), he has to determine how far away his twin was when the signal was emitted—in other words, he has to consider simultaneity for a distant event.
*If he wants to calculate how fast his twin was aging when the image was transmitted, he adjusts for the Doppler shift. For example, when he receives high frequency images (showing his twin aging rapidly) with frequency &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{f_\mathrm{rest}\sqrt{\left({1 + v/c}\right)/\left({1 - v/c}\right)}}&lt;/math&gt;, he does not conclude that the twin was aging that rapidly when the image was generated, any more than he concludes that the siren of an ambulance is emitting the frequency he hears. He knows that the [[Doppler effect]] has increased the image frequency by the factor 1 / (1 − ''v''/''c''). Therefore, he calculates that his twin was aging at the rate of
:&lt;math&gt;f_\mathrm{rest}\sqrt{\left({1 + v/c}\right)/\left({1 - v/c}\right)}\times \left(1 - v/c\right) = f_\mathrm{rest}\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}\equiv\epsilon f_\mathrm{rest}&lt;/math&gt;
when the image was emitted. A similar calculation reveals that his twin was aging at the same reduced rate of ''εf''&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt; in all low frequency images.

===Simultaneity in the Doppler shift calculation===
It may be difficult to see where simultaneity came into the Doppler shift calculation, and indeed the calculation is often preferred because one does not have to worry about simultaneity. As seen above, the ship twin can convert his received Doppler-shifted rate to a slower rate of the clock of the distant clock for both red and blue images. If he ignores simultaneity, he might say his twin was aging at the reduced rate throughout the journey and therefore should be younger than he is. He is now back to square one, and has to take into account the change in his notion of simultaneity at the turnaround. The rate he can calculate for the image (corrected for Doppler effect) is the rate of the Earth twin's clock at the moment it was sent, not at the moment it was received. Since he receives an unequal number of red and blue shifted images, he should realize that the red and blue shifted emissions were not emitted over equal time periods for the Earth twin, and therefore he must account for simultaneity at a distance.

==Viewpoint of the traveling twin==
During the turnaround, the traveling twin is in an [[accelerated reference frame]]. According to the [[equivalence principle]], the traveling twin may analyze the turnaround phase as if the stay-at-home twin were freely falling in a gravitational field and as if the traveling twin were stationary. A 1918 paper by Einstein presents a conceptual sketch of the idea.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Einstein, A. (1918) "[[s:Dialog about objections against the theory of relativity|dialog about objections against the theory of relativity]]", ''Die Naturwissenschaften'' '''48''', pp. 697–702, 29 November 1918&lt;/ref&gt; From the viewpoint of the traveler, a calculation for each separate leg, ignoring the turnaround, leads to a result in which the Earth clocks age less than the traveler. For example, if the Earth clocks age 1&amp;nbsp;day less on each leg, the amount that the Earth clocks will lag behind amounts to 2&amp;nbsp;days. The physical description of what happens at turnaround has to produce a contrary effect of double that amount: 4&amp;nbsp;days' advancing of the Earth clocks. Then the traveler's clock will end up with a net 2-day delay on the Earth clocks, in agreement with calculations done in the frame of the stay-at-home twin.

The mechanism for the advancing of the stay-at-home twin's clock is [[gravitational time dilation]]. When an observer finds that inertially moving objects are being accelerated with respect to themselves, those objects are in a gravitational field insofar as relativity is concerned. For the traveling twin at turnaround, this gravitational field fills the universe. In a weak field approximation, clocks tick at a rate of {{nowrap|&lt;var&gt;t'&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} ''t'' (1 + ''Φ'' / ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} where ''Φ'' is the difference in gravitational potential. In this case, {{nowrap|''Φ'' {{=}} ''gh''}} where ''g'' is the acceleration of the traveling observer during turnaround and ''h'' is the distance to the stay-at-home twin. The rocket is firing towards the stay-at-home twin, thereby placing that twin at a higher gravitational potential. Due to the large distance between the twins, the stay-at-home twin's clocks will appear to be sped up enough to account for the difference in proper times experienced by the twins. It is no accident that this speed-up is enough to account for the simultaneity shift described above. The general relativity solution for a static homogeneous gravitational field and the special relativity solution for finite acceleration produce identical results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=Preston |title=The clock paradox in a static homogeneous gravitational field |journal=Foundations of Physics Letters |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=75–85 |date=February 2006 |author2=Wanex, L.F.  |arxiv=physics/0604025 |doi=10.1007/s10702-006-1850-3 |bibcode=2006FoPhL..19...75J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other calculations have been done for the traveling twin (or for any observer who sometimes accelerates), which do not involve the equivalence principle, and which do not involve any gravitational fields. Such calculations are based only on the special theory, not the general theory, of relativity. One approach calculates surfaces of simultaneity by considering light pulses, in accordance with [[Hermann Bondi]]'s idea of the [[k-calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dolby, Carl E.  |author2=Gull, Stephen F  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=On Radar Time and the Twin 'Paradox' |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=69 |year=2001 |pages=1257–1261 |arxiv=gr-qc/0104077 |bibcode=2001AmJPh..69.1257D |doi=10.1119/1.1407254 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second approach calculates a straightforward but technically complicated integral to determine how the traveling twin measures the elapsed time on the stay-at-home clock. An outline of this second approach is given in a [[Twin paradox#Difference in elapsed times: how to calculate it from the ship|separate section below]].

==Difference in elapsed time as a result of differences in twins' spacetime paths==

The following paragraph shows several things:
*how to employ a precise mathematical approach in calculating the differences in the elapsed time
*how to prove exactly the dependency of the elapsed time on the different paths taken through spacetime by the two twins
*how to quantify the differences in elapsed time
*how to calculate [[proper time]] as a function (integral) of [[coordinate time]]

Let clock ''K'' be associated with the "stay at home twin".
Let clock &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt; be associated with the rocket that makes the trip.
At the departure event both clocks are set to 0.

:Phase 1: Rocket (with clock &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt;) embarks with constant [[proper acceleration]] ''a'' during a time ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; as measured by clock ''K'' until it reaches some velocity ''V''.
:Phase 2: Rocket keeps coasting at velocity ''V'' during some time ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; according to clock ''K''.
:Phase 3: Rocket fires its engines in the opposite direction of ''K'' during a time ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; according to clock ''K'' until it is at rest with respect to clock ''K''. The constant proper acceleration has the value −''a'', in other words the rocket is ''decelerating''.
:Phase 4: Rocket keeps firing its engines in the opposite direction of ''K'', during the same time ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; according to clock ''K'', until &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt; regains the same speed ''V'' with respect to ''K'', but now towards ''K'' (with velocity −''V'').
:Phase 5: Rocket keeps coasting towards ''K'' at speed ''V'' during the same time ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; according to clock ''K''.
:Phase 6: Rocket again fires its engines in the direction of ''K'', so it decelerates with a constant proper acceleration ''a'' during a time ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, still according to clock ''K'', until both clocks reunite.

Knowing that the clock ''K'' remains inertial (stationary), the total accumulated [[proper time]] Δ''τ'' of clock &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt; will be given by the integral function of [[coordinate time]] Δ''t''
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \tau = \int \sqrt{ 1 - (v(t)/c)^2 } \ dt \ &lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''(''t'') is the ''coordinate velocity'' of clock &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt; as a function of ''t'' according to clock ''K'', and, e.g. during phase 1, given by
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = \frac{a t}{ \sqrt{1+  \left( \frac{a t}{c} \right)^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This integral can be calculated for the 6 phases:&lt;ref&gt;C. Lagoute and E. Davoust (1995) The interstellar traveler, ''Am. J. Phys.'' '''63''':221-227&lt;/ref&gt;

:Phase 2 &lt;math&gt;:\quad T_c \ \sqrt{ 1 - V^2/c^2 }&lt;/math&gt;
:Phase 3 &lt;math&gt;:\quad c / a \ \text{arsinh}( a \ T_a/c )\,&lt;/math&gt;
:Phase 4 &lt;math&gt;:\quad c / a \ \text{arsinh}( a \ T_a/c )\,&lt;/math&gt;
:Phase 5 &lt;math&gt;:\quad T_c \ \sqrt{ 1 - V^2/c^2 }&lt;/math&gt;
:Phase 6 &lt;math&gt;:\quad c / a \ \text{arsinh}( a \ T_a/c )\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is the proper acceleration, felt by clock &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt; during the acceleration phase(s) and where the following relations hold between ''V'', ''a'' and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;V = a \ T_a / \sqrt{ 1 + (a \ T_a/c)^2 }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a \ T_a = V / \sqrt{ 1 - V^2/c^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

So the traveling clock &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt; will show an elapsed time of
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \tau = 2 T_c \sqrt{ 1 - V^2/c^2 } + 4 c / a \ \text{arsinh}( a \ T_a/c )&lt;/math&gt;
which can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \tau = 2 T_c / \sqrt{ 1 + (a \ T_a/c)^2 } + 4 c / a \ \text{arsinh}( a \ T_a/c )&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the stationary clock ''K'' shows an elapsed time of
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = 2 T_c + 4 T_a\,&lt;/math&gt;
which is, for every possible value of ''a'', ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V'', larger than the reading of clock &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t &gt; \Delta \tau\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Difference in elapsed times: how to calculate it from the ship==
[[Image:TwinParadoxProperAcceleration2.svg|thumb|right|250px|Twin paradox employing a rocket following an acceleration profile in terms of proper time τ and by setting c=1: Phase 1 (a=0.6, τ=2); Phase 2 (a=0, τ=2); Phase 3-4 (a=-0.6, 2τ=4); Phase 5 (a=0, τ=2); Phase 6 (a=0.6, τ=2). The twins meet at T=17.3 and τ=12.]]

In the standard proper time formula
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \tau = \int_0^{\Delta t} \sqrt{ 1 - \left(\frac{v(t)}{c}\right)^2 } \ dt, \ &lt;/math&gt;

Δ''τ'' represents the time of the non-inertial (travelling) observer &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt; as a function of the elapsed time Δ''t'' of the inertial (stay-at-home) observer ''K'' for whom observer &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt; has velocity ''v''(''t'') at time ''t''.

To calculate the elapsed time Δ''t'' of the inertial observer ''K'' as a function of the elapsed time Δ''τ'' of the non-inertial observer &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt;, where only quantities measured by &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt; are accessible, the following formula can be used:&lt;ref name='Minguzzi'&gt;E. Minguzzi (2005) - Differential aging from acceleration: An explicit formula - ''Am. J. Phys.'' '''73''': 876-880 [https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0411233 arXiv:physics/0411233] (Notation of source variables was adapted to match this article's.)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t^2 = \left[ \int^{\Delta\tau}_0 e^{\int^{\bar{\tau}}_0 a(\tau')d \tau'} \, d \bar\tau\right] \,\left[\int^{\Delta \tau}_0 e^{-\int^{\bar\tau}_0 a(\tau')d \tau'} \, d \bar\tau \right], \ &lt;/math&gt;
where ''a(τ)'' is the [[proper acceleration]] of the non-inertial observer &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt; as measured by himself (for instance with an accelerometer) during the whole round-trip. The [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] can be used to show that the inequality {{nowrap|Δ''t'' &amp;gt; Δ''τ''}} follows from the previous expression:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta t^2 &amp; = \left[ \int^{\Delta\tau}_0 e^{\int^{\bar{\tau}}_0 a(\tau')d\tau'} \, d \bar\tau\right] \,\left[\int^{\Delta \tau}_0 e^{-\int^{\bar\tau}_0 a(\tau')d \tau'} \, d \bar\tau \right] \\
&amp; &gt; \left[ \int^{\Delta\tau}_0 e^{\int^{\bar{\tau}}_0 a(\tau')d\tau'} \, e^{-\int^{\bar\tau}_0 a(\tau') \, d \tau'} \, d \bar\tau \right]^2 = \left[ \int^{\Delta\tau}_0 d \bar\tau \right]^2 = \Delta \tau^2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[Dirac delta function]] to model the infinite acceleration phase in the standard case of the traveller having constant speed ''v'' during the outbound and the inbound trip, the formula produces the known result:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\tfrac{v^2}{c^2}}} \Delta\tau .\ &lt;/math&gt;

In the case where the accelerated observer &lt;var&gt;K'&lt;/var&gt; departs from ''K'' with zero initial velocity, the general equation reduces to the simpler form:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = \int^{\Delta\tau}_0 e^{\pm\int^{\bar{\tau}}_0 a(\tau')d \tau'} \, d \bar\tau , \ &lt;/math&gt;
which, in the ''smooth'' version of the twin paradox where the traveller has constant proper acceleration phases, successively given by ''a'', −''a'', −''a'', ''a'', results in&lt;ref name='Minguzzi'/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = \tfrac{4}{a} \sinh( \tfrac{a}{4} \Delta\tau) \ &lt;/math&gt;
where the convention ''c'' = 1 is used, in accordance with the above expression with acceleration phases {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} Δ''t''/4}} and inertial (coasting) phases {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.}}

==A rotational version==
Twins Bob and Alice inhabit a space station in circular orbit around a massive body in space. Bob suits up and exits the station. While Alice remains inside the station, continuing to orbit with it as before, Bob uses a rocket propulsion system to cease orbiting and hover where he was. When the station completes an orbit and returns to Bob, he rejoins Alice. Alice is now younger than Bob.&lt;ref name=Hobson&gt;{{cite book |title=General Relativity: An Introduction for Physicists |author=Michael Paul Hobson, [[George Efstathiou]], Anthony N. Lasenby |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xma1QuTJphYC |page=227 |isbn=0-521-82951-8 |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}} See [https://books.google.com/books?id=xma1QuTJphYC&amp;pg=PA227 exercise 9.25] on page 227.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to rotational acceleration, Bob must decelerate to become stationary and then accelerate again to match the orbital speed of the space station.

==No twin paradox in an absolute frame of reference==
Einstein's conclusion of an actual difference in registered clock times (or aging) between reunited parties caused Paul Langevin to posit an actual, albeit experimentally undetectable, absolute frame of reference: 

In 1911, Langevin wrote: "A uniform translation in the aether has no experimental sense. But because of this it should not be concluded, as has sometimes happened prematurely, that the concept of aether must be abandoned, that the aether is non-existent and inaccessible to experiment. Only a uniform velocity relative to it cannot be detected, but any change of velocity .. has an absolute sense."&lt;ref&gt;Langevin, P. (1911), "The evolution of space and time", Scientia, X: p.47 (translated by J. B. Sykes, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, [[Henri Poincaré]] posthumous ''Last Essays'' were published and there he had restated his position: "Today some physicists want to adopt a new convention. It is not that they are constrained to do so; they consider this new convention more convenient; that is all. And those who are not of this opinion can legitimately retain the old one."."&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré, Henri. (1913), ''Mathematics and science: last essays'' (Dernières pensées'').&lt;/ref&gt;

In the relativity of Poincaré and [[Hendrik Lorentz]], which assumes an absolute (though experimentally indiscernable) frame of reference, no twin paradox arises due to the fact that clock slowing (along with length contraction and velocity) is regarded as an actuality, hence the actual time differential between the reunited clocks. 

That interpretation of relativity, which John A. Wheeler calls "ether theory B (length contraction plus time contraction)", did not gain as much traction as Einstein's, which simply disregarded any deeper reality behind the symmetrical measurements across inertial frames. There is no physical test which distinguishes one interpretation from the other.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, J., Taylor, E. (1992). Spacetime Physics, second edition. W. H. Freeman: New York, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently (in 2005), Robert B. Laughlin (Physics Nobel Laureate, Stanford University), wrote about the nature of space: 

"It is ironic that Einstein's most creative work, the general theory of relativity, should boil down to conceptualizing space as a medium when his original premise [in special relativity] was that no such medium existed . . . The word 'ether' has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics because of its past association with opposition to relativity. This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum. . . . Relativity actually says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of matter pervading the universe, only that any such matter must have relativistic symmetry." (i.e., as measured)."&lt;ref&gt;Laughlin, Robert B. (2005). A Different Universe: Reinventing Physics from the Bottom Down. Basic Books, NY, NY.  pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

A. P. French writes, in ''Special Relativity'':  

"Note, though, that we are appealing to the reality of A's acceleration, and to the observability of the inertial forces associated with it.  Would such effects as the twin paradox exist if the framework of fixed stars and distant galaxies were not there?  Most physicists would say no. Our ultimate definition of an inertial frame may indeed be that it is a frame having zero acceleration with respect to the matter of the universe at large.")."&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P. (1968). Special Relativity. W.W. Norton, New York. p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12939">'''Unit cohesion''' is a [[military]] concept, defined by one former [[United States]] [[Chief of staff]] in the early 1980s as "the bonding together of soldiers in such a way as to sustain their will and commitment to each other, the unit, and mission accomplishment, despite combat or mission stress".&lt;ref name=manning&gt;"Morale and Cohesion in Military Psychiatry, Fred Manning, [http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/military_psychiatry/MPch1.pdf p.4] in ''Military Psychiatry: Preparing in Peace for War'', {{ISBN|0-16-059132-5}}; Manning cites Meyer, EC, "The unit", ''Defense'', 1982;82(February):1-9
&lt;/ref&gt; However the concept lacks a consensus definition among military analysts, [[sociologist]]s and [[psychologist]]s.&lt;ref name=palmer&gt;Brian Palmer (2010), [http://www.slate.com/id/2276469/ "Pentagon Sees Little Risk in Allowing Gay Men and Women to Serve Openly"] [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], Dec. 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Unit cohesion is a military concept dating back to at least [[Carl von Clausewitz]], if not to [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cox|first=Alexander A.|title=Unit cohesion and morale in combat: survival in a culturally and racially heterogeneous environment|publisher=School of Advanced Military Studies|location=For Leavenworth, KS|year=1995|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA309830&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf|accessdate=2011-04-25|quote=... Clausewitz makes the inference that the unit cohesion is more a factor of the morale of the unit as a whole rather than an equally decisive factor. He does not, however, underrate the value of cohesion. He wrote that the loss of order and cohesion in a unit often makes even the resistance of individual units fatal for them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scholars have cited the influence of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s thinking on theories of unit cohesion.&lt;ref name=vanEpps/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Czander|first=William|title=The psychodynamics of work and organizations : theory and application|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|year=1993|isbn=0-89862-284-0 |quote=Freud maintains that cohesion is found in a group when all members introject the same subject into their ego ideal and then identify with each other. ... This phenomenon explains why soldiers willingly give up their thinking capacity and blindly follow orders from their leader. ... The soldiers as a group become a cohesive unit because they have all identified with each other.|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Why soldiers fight. Part I. Leadership, cohesion and fighter spirit." Robert B. Smith, 1983, ''Quality &amp; Quantity'', Volume 18, Number 1, 1–32, {{doi|10.1007/BF00221449}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of them noted that Freud wrote of [[wikt:Special:Search/cohesion|cohesion]] breakdown among [[soldier]]s, asserting that it leads to [[panic]], [[insubordination]], self-interested rather than [[cooperative]] reactions to threats, and "a gigantic and senseless dread".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1922). ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]''. [http://www.bartleby.com/290/5.html Chapter V. Two Artificial Groups: The Church and the Army ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The later development of the concept is strongly informed by the work of [[Morris Janowitz]], who, with [[Edward Shils]], began writing on the topic in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Caforio, ''Handbook of the Sociology of the Military'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Iep9WSMEzS8C&amp;pg=PA63&amp; p.63], Springer, 2006. {{ISBN|0-387-32456-9}}. "The first attempt to establish a theory of cohesion and effectiveness within combat troops belongs to Edward Shils and Morris Janowitz (Shils and Janowitz, 1948). ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Janowitiz continued to work in this area in his [[sociological]] work, as the disruptive policy of frequently rotating individual soldiers and [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s during the [[Vietnam War]] came under scrutiny as a large factor behind low [[morale]].&lt;ref&gt;Milam, John R. (2009). ''Not a gentleman's war: an inside view of junior officers in the Vietnam War'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=c7GtdC39bEAC&amp;pg=PA142&amp; p. 142], UNC Press Books, {{ISBN|0-8078-3330-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the studies of several [[World War II]] armies, sociologists concluded that [[comrade]]ly ties between small combat units is a decisive factor in providing good morale, cohesion, and organization framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George|first=[[Alexander L. George|Alexander]]|title=The Chinese Communist Army in Action: The Korean War and its Aftermath|year=1967|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Western forces by the poorly equipped [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[People's Liberation Army]] in the [[Korean War]] in 1950 further generated interest on the role of "human elements" on modern [[battle]]fields.&lt;ref&gt;George 1967, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Western armies traditionally created ties between soldiers through informal means such as [[teamwork]] or shared hardships instilled by [[discipline]],&lt;ref&gt;George 1967, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; the Chinese army relied on formal methods to assimilate recruits into their units.&lt;ref&gt;George 1967, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The assimilation process involved features such as [[coercive persuasion]], [[surveillance]], and [[political]] control,&lt;ref&gt;George 1967, pp. 31–35.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[military rank]]s and physical punishments were abolished to allow closer relations between officers and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;George 1967, pp. 36-38.&lt;/ref&gt; The stringent assimilation methods allowed the Chinese to create high morale and cohesion compared to the Western forces.&lt;ref&gt;George 1967, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, high casualty rates and the lack of modern equipment later resulted in a significant erosion of morale and cohesion as the Korean War dragged on.&lt;ref&gt;George 1967, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the worst cases of this erosion was the partial disintegration of the Chinese army during the spring offensive in May 1951.&lt;ref&gt;George 1967, p. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, one researcher stated that, regardless of whether unit cohesion was an actual [[Motivation|motivator]] or merely a stabilizer, what mattered was that unit cohesion "enhanced fighting power", because it reduced "combat inhibitors (stress, fear, isolation)" and promoted "[[esprit de corps]], morale and teamwork".&lt;ref name=kaplan87&gt;Roger Kaplan (1987). [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA515790&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf "Army Unit Cohesion in Vietnam: A Bum Rap" ], [[U.S. Army War College]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has, however, concluded that there is value in distinguishing the components of [[group cohesiveness|social cohesion]] and "[t]ask cohesion&amp;nbsp;... the commitment to working together on a shared goal", since some studies conclude that unit [[effectiveness]] correlates strongly with task cohesion, not with social cohesion.&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; This debate about the relative importance, or even need for, the concepts of social cohesion and task cohesion is exemplified by an exchange between Anthony King and Guy Siebold in the journal ''[[Armed Forces &amp; Society]]'' in 2006–2007.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony King, "The Word of Command: Communication and Cohesion in the Military," ''Armed Forces and Society 32'', 4 (2006): 493–512; Guy L. Siebold, "The Essence of Military Group Cohesion," ''Armed Forces and Society'' 33, 2 (2007), 286–295; Anthony King, "The Existence of Group Cohesion in the Armed Forces: A Response to Guy Siebold," ''Armed Forces and Society'' 33, 4 (2007): 638–645.&lt;/ref&gt;

One U.S. military researcher has drawn a distinction between teamwork and unit cohesion—claiming teamwork as being merely "[[collaboration]]", while unit cohesion involves a bond that can sustain mutual commitment, not just to the mission, but to each other, and to the group as a whole. This added bond, he argued, enabled teamwork under conditions under which an organization might otherwise break down.&lt;ref name=vanEpps&gt;van Epps (2008-12-31), [http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20081231_art015.pdf "Relooking Unit Cohesion: A sensemaking approach"], ''Military Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

==New uses of unit cohesion in research==
The concept of cohesion was originally used primarily to examine combat behavior. However, more recently models of cohesion have been applied to other phenomena characterized by stress, uncertainty, and the strategic interaction of groups.&lt;ref&gt;Guy L. Siebold, "The Evolution of the Measurement of Cohesion," ''Military Psychology'' 11, 1 (1999). For an interesting example see Osiel, ''Obeying Orders: Atrocity, Military Discipline, and the Law of War''.&lt;/ref&gt; Uzi Ben-Shalom et al. looked at cohesion during Israeli Defense Force operations in the Occupied Territories during the al-Aqsa Intifada, while Paul Bartone and Amy Adler examined cohesion in a multi-national peacekeeping operation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Bartone and Amy Adler, "Cohesion over Time in a Peacekeeping Medical Task Force," ''Military Psychology'' 11, 1 (1999); Uzi Ben-Shalom, Zeev Lehrer, and Eyal Ben-Ari, "Cohesion During Military Operations: A Field Study on Combat Units in the Al-Aqsa Intifada," ''Armed Forces and Society'' 32, 1 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Terence Lee used a broad concept of cohesion to explain military behavior during events in China in 1989 and Indonesia in 1998 and, in another article, the Philippines in 1986 and Indonesia in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Terence Lee, "Military Cohesion and Regime Maintenance: Explaining the Role of the Military in 1989 China and 1998 Indonesia," Armed Forces and Society 32, 1 (2005): 80–104; Terence Lee, "The Armed Forces and Transitions from Authoritarian Rule: Explaining the Role of the Military in 1986 Philippines and 1998 Indonesia," ''Comparative Political Studies'' 42, 5 (2009): 640–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucan Way and Steven Levitsky also used a broad concept of cohesion in order to explain regime maintenance in the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Lucan A.Way and Steven Levitsky, "The Dynamics of Autocratic Coercion after the Cold War," ''Communist and Post-Communist Studies'' 39 (2006): 387–410.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Lehrke developed a multi-level model to facilitate the use of both social and task cohesion for examining military behavior during revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Lehrke, "A Cohesion Model for Assessing Military Arbitration of Revolutions." Armed Forces &amp; Society 0095327X12459851, first published on 22 January 2013 as doi: 10.1177/0095327 X12459851 (Print edition forthcoming 2013, OnlineFirst at: http://afs.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/01/18/0095327X12459851).&lt;/ref&gt; Less elaborate versions of this approach can also be seen in work by Dale Herspring and earlier work by Jesse Lehrke.&lt;ref&gt;Dale R. Herspring, "Undermining Combat Readiness in the Russian Military, 1992–2005" ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'' 32, 4 (2006): 513–531; Jesse Paul Lehrke, ''The Transition to National Armies in the Former Soviet Republics, 1988–2005'' (Oxfordshire, UK: Routledge, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
