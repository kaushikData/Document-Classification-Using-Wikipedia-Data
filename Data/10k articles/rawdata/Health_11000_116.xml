In the '''2013 dengue outbreak in Singapore''', a significant rise in the number of [[dengue fever]] cases was reported in [[Singapore]]. In the week of 16–22 June 2013, there was a record of 842 dengue cases in Singapore in a single week. This figure was far beyond the highest number of cases per week in the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The number of weekly dengue fever cases has exceeded the epidemic threshold of 237.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dengue.gov.sg/subject.asp?id=73 |title=Latest Dengue Data |publisher=National Environment Agency |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As official data showed, more than 13,000 people were infected with dengue as of mid-July in 2013, fast nearing the total 14,209 infections in [[2005 dengue outbreak in Singapore|2005 dengue outbreak]], the worst year on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/354695/singapore-fights-back-against-worsening-dengue-outbreak.html|title=Singapore fights back against worsening dengue outbreak|accessdate=2013-06-12|date=2013-06-12|work=Bangkok Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 record was officially passed on 5 August 2013 with more than 14,000 people infected. The total number of cases soared past the 20000 mark on 18 November 2013.

The number of dengue cases is rising at a faster rate and is expected to surpass 1,000 infections in a week.&lt;ref name="Salma Khalik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yourhealth.asiaone.com/content/dengue-cases-expected-surpass-1000-week|title=Dengue cases expected to surpass 1,000 a week|accessdate=2013-06-14|author=Salma Khalik|date=2013-06-14|publisher=asiaone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of cases passed the 150% mark of the previous record on 13 December with 21,324 cases.

In the fourth week of June, a total of 842 new cases were reported, bringing the total number of dengue cases to cross the 11,000 mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/dengue-cases-cross-9-000/701672.html|title=Dengue cases cross 9,000 mark|accessdate=2013-06-09|author=Alvina Soh|date=2013-06-07|publisher=Channel NewsAsia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total number of Dengue cases subsequently crossed the 13,000 mark on 16 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/dengue-cases-cross-10000-mark|title=Dengue cases cross 10,000 mark|accessdate=2013-06-19|author=Woo Sian Boon|date=2013-06-18|publisher=TODAYonline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deaths===
Dengue claimed its first death in Singapore on 29 May 2013. The victim was diagnosed as having viral fever on 23 May at [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital]]'s Emergency Department. He was then discharged with the advice to return if his condition worsened. He subsequently returned to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 26 May and was diagnosed with dengue fever. He then died from dengue shock syndrome on 29 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/dengue-claims-first-life-in-current-epid/692484.html|title=Dengue claims first life in current epidemic|accessdate=2013-06-09|author=Sara Grosse|date=2013-05-30|publisher=Channel NewsAsia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June 2013, a second person died from dengue in Singapore. He was tested positive for dengue on 8 June, but his condition deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/second-person-dies-from/703098.html|title=Second person dies from dengue in Singapore|accessdate=2013-06-09|author=Dylan Loh|date=2013-06-09|publisher=Channel NewsAsia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third dengue death was reported on 25 June 2013. He was admitted to [[Khoo Teck Puat Hospital]] emergency department (ED) on 22 June 2013 with fever and low blood pressure. He was then sent to the [[Intensive Care Unit]] (ICU) diagnosed with a dengue shock syndrome, kidney failure and liver inflammation. His condition deteriorated and died on 25 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/86-year-old-man-from/724144.html|title=86-year-old man from Sembawang dies from dengue; third death this year|accessdate=2013-06-25|author=|date=2013-06-25|publisher=Channel NewsAsia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Indonesian male was also pronounced dead on 25 June 2013 and has become the fourth person to die from dengue in Singapore. The victim contracted dengue fever overseas between 10–21 June 2013 and was subsequently sent to [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital]]'s Emergency Department on 23 June 2013 after a prolonged 3-day fever. His condition started to deteriorate on 24 June 2013 in the Intensive Care unit (ICU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/fourth-dengue-death-singapore-reported|title=Fourth dengue death in Singapore reported|accessdate=2013-07-05|author=|date=2013-06-26|publisher=TODAYonline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth person to die from dengue in Singapore was a 66-year-old Chinese male who suffered multi-organ failure from severe dengue shock syndrome. He had initially gone to the Emergency Department on 2 July with fever and lethargy, and subsequent tests confirmed dengue fever. He was admitted and transferred to the ICU after deterioration, but continued to deteriorate and died on the morning of 8 July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/66-year-old-man-dies-from/737984.html "66-year-old man dies from dengue in S'pore"] Channel Newsasia. Retrieved 2013-8-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth death was a 52-year-old Chinese male. He was first seen at Jurong Polyclinic on 29 June 2013 with a two-day history of fever. He returned to the polyclinic a few days later as he was still having fever and was referred by the polyclinic to the National University Hospital (NUH) emergency department. He was admitted to NUH's Medical Intensive Care Unit on the same day and was diagnosed with Dengue Shock Syndrome. The patient's condition improved transiently after dialysis and supportive therapy but he remained critically ill with low blood counts. The patient's condition deteriorated after he developed pneumonia with septic shock on 11 August 2013 and he died on 13 Aug 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-s-5th-dengue/775480.html "Singapore's 5th dengue death this year"] Channel Newsasia. Retrieved 2013-8-13&lt;/ref&gt;

A 35-year-old Chinese woman died of dengue on Monday, becoming the seventh death in 2013. The patient, who lived at Yishun Ring Road, had gone to the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital's Emergency Department on 28 September 2013 with a history of fever, chest pain, lethargy, nausea and loss of appetite and had intermittent fever for three weeks. She was diagnosed with dengue fever and admitted but her condition deteriorated after admission and she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on the same day. Despite these measures, the patient died on 30 September 2013 at 5.05am.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/35-year-old-woman-dies-of/831486.html "35-year-old woman dies of dengue"] Channel Newsasia. Retrieved 2013-9-30&lt;/ref&gt;

A 53-year-old woman has become the seventh local dengue death case this year, and the overall eighth death. In a joint statement, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) said the dengue patient lived at Hougang Street 22. The woman, who was first seen at Tan Tock Hospital's Emergency Department on 11 November, had a history of fever. She was diagnosed with dengue and admitted. Her condition deteriorated and she died on 16 November.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/7th-person-dies-of-dengue/893740.html "7th person dies of dengue"] Channel Newsasia.

==Preventive measures==
On 5 June 2013, Sembawang-Nee Soon Town Council was fined S$200 for allowing mosquitos to breed in water tanks the council controlled. Officers from the [[National Environment Agency]] (NEA) found mosquito larvae in water tanks at the rooftops of Blocks 896C and 899A in Woodlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sembawang-nee-soon-town/698832.html|title=Sembawang-Nee Soon Town Council fined S$200 for mosquito breeding|accessdate=2013-06-09|author=Ng Lian Cheong and Alvina Soh|date=2013-06-05|publisher=Channel NewsAsia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 2013, the head of NEA announced that they will be recruiting more officers to conduct routine checks at all homes in the active cluster zone. At the same time, the National Environment Agency started using its legislative powers. The agency got a locksmith to open ten homes as the residents did not respond to notices sent to them.&lt;ref name="Salma Khalik"/&gt;

On 2 July 2013, [[People's Association (Singapore)|People's Association]] (PA) announced that they will be recruiting 10,000 volunteers to assist NEA officers during house visits, they will be named as "dengue fighters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yourhealth.asiaone.com/content/pa-recruit-10000-volunteer-dengue-fighters|title=PA to recruit 10,000 volunteer 'dengue fighters'|accessdate=2013-07-05|author=Ian Poh|date=2013-07-02|publisher=asiaone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=today&gt;Tracking Singapore's dengue epidemic [http://www.todayonline.com/singapore-dengue-epidemic-outbreak "Tracking Singapore's dengue epidemic"], ''[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]'', Singapore, 10 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abnormal basal metabolic rate''' refers to a high or low [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR). It has numerous causes, both physiological (part of the body's normal function) and pathological (associated with disease).

==Causes==
===Physiological===
An abnormal basal metabolic rate is not necessarily indicative of disease; a number of physiological factors can alter the BMR by influencing [[metabolism|cellular metabolic activity]].&lt;ref name=bijlani&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Medical Physiology|page=383|edition=4th|first=R. L. |last=Bijlani|first2= S. |last2=Manjunatha|publisher=[[Jaypee Brothers]]|year=2010|isbn=9789380704814}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, males are more likely than females to have a high BMR, and in women, the BMR may rise to abnormal levels during pregnancy or lactation.&lt;ref name=marks&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHK7S7t47BEC&amp;pg=PA8|title=Marks' Basic Medical Biochemistry: A Clinical Approach|first=Michael |last=Lieberman|first2= Allan D.|last2= Marks|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|year=2009|isbn=9780781770224}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's BMR varies greatly with age: infants and children typically have a high BMR, required for growth, while the elderly have a low BMR.&lt;ref name=bijlani/&gt; Tall, thin people have a higher BMR than their shorter counterparts, even with the same weight, due to the greater surface area of their skin.&lt;ref name=bruyne&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BN2PJSajgSIC&amp;pg=PA150|page=150|title=Nutrition and Diet Therapy|first=Linda |last=DeBruyne|first2= Eleanor|last2= Whitney|first3= Kathryn|last3= Pinna|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2007| isbn=9780495119166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metabolic rate also decreases during sleep and increases in exercise, and individuals who exercise regularly have a higher BMR than those who are sedentary.&lt;ref name=bijlani/&gt; Environmental temperature also has an effect: the BMR is increased in both heat and cold.&lt;ref name=bruyne/&gt;

===Pathological===
A common pathological cause for a high BMR is [[fever]], since a rise in body temperature increases the rate of cellular metabolic reactions.&lt;ref name=bijlani/&gt; It is estimated that for every degree [[Fahrenheit]] of rise in body temperature, the BMR increases by 7 percent.&lt;ref name=bruyne/&gt;

[[Thyroid disease]] also has a marked effect on BMR, since [[thyroid hormone]]s regulate the rate of cellular metabolism.&lt;ref name=bruyne/&gt; [[Hyperthyroidism]]—in which there is an increase in the production of thyroid hormones—leads to a high BMR, while [[hypothyroidism]]—in which thyroid hormones are depleted—causes a low BMR.&lt;ref name=bijlani/&gt;

Prolonged periods of abnormal nutrition cause an adaptive change in BMR; this helps the body to maintain a stable body weight in response to the change in food supply. In prolonged [[malnutrition]], the BMR declines, while in prolonged [[overnutrition]], the BMR is increased.&lt;ref name=bijlani/&gt; [[Cancer]] sometimes causes an increase in BMR, perhaps because the [[cancer cell]]s that form tumors have a high level of metabolic activity.&lt;ref name=bijlani/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1643">'''Association of Telehealth Service Providers''' (ATSP) is an international membership-based [[trade]] [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to improving health care through growth of the [[telehealth]] industry and promoting the use of [[telecommunications]] in healthcare. Its main activities are advocacy, education awareness programs, and business support services. It is a business-oriented group which focuses on providing members with information and tools to facilitate the success of their telehealth activities.

ATSP believes that [[telemedicine]] is a practical tool that can improve the distribution of healthcare services to the benefit of both patients and providers.

It was founded in 1996 by [[Douglas Perednia]], MD and is located in [[Portland, Oregon]].  Its executive director is [[Will Engle]].

==Telemedicine Information Exchange ==

In June 2006, the ATSP announced that it was taking over the hosting and updating responsibilities for the [[Telemedicine Information Exchange]] (TIE). The TIE's mission is to provide an online, unbiased, all-inclusive platform for information on telemedicine and telehealth. As of April 2012, this site seems to be down.

The '''Bachelor of Science in Nursing''' ('''BSN''', '''BScN''') also known in some countries as a '''Bachelor of Nursing''' ('''BN''') or '''Bachelor of Science''' ('''BS''') '''with a Major in Nursing''' is an [[academic degree]] in the science and principles of [[nursing]], granted by an accredited [[tertiary education]] provider. The course of study is typically three or four years. The difference in degree designation may relate to the amount of basic science courses required as part of the degree, with BScN and BSN degree curriculums requiring completion of more courses on math and [[Natural science|natural sciences]] that are more typical of [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degrees (e.g. calculus, physics, chemistry, biology) and BN curriculums more focused on [[nursing theory]], nursing process, and teaching versions of general science topics that are adapted to be more specific and relevant to nursing practice. Nursing school students are generally required to take courses in social and behavioral sciences and liberal arts, including nutrition, anatomy, chemistry, mathematics, and English. In addition to those courses, experience in physical and social sciences, communication, leadership, and critical thinking is required for a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Become a Registered Nurse|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/registered-nurses.htm#tab-4|website=United States Department of Labor|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=3 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430085655/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/registered-nurses.htm#tab-4|archivedate=30 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; BSN programs typically last 3–4 years. With a BSN you can work in private medical and surgical hospital, a physician's office, public medical and surgical hospitals, home health care services, and nursing facilities. Having a BSN can result in more opportunities and better salary than just an associate degree. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earning Your Bachelor's Degree in Nursing Can Expand Your Career Options|url=http://www.allnursingschools.com/bsn/|website=Earning Your Bachelor's Degree in Nursing Can Expand Your Career Options|publisher=All Nursing Schools|accessdate=3 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606195449/http://www.allnursingschools.com/bsn/|archivedate=6 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bachelor's degree]] prepares [[nurses]] for a wide variety of professional roles and graduate study. Course work includes nursing science, [[Nursing research|research]], [[Nursing management|leadership]], and related areas that inform the practice of nursing. It also provides the student with general education in math, humanities and social sciences. An undergraduate degree affords opportunities for greater career advancement and higher salary options. It is often a prerequisite for teaching, administrative, consulting and research roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Become a Registered Nurse|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/registered-nurses.htm#tab-4|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=5 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201165940/http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/registered-nurses.htm#tab-4|archivedate=1 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bachelor of Science in Nursing is not currently required for entry into professional nursing in all countries. In the US, there has been an effort for it to become the entry level degree since 1964, when the [[American Nurses Association]] (ANA) advanced the position that the minimum preparation for beginning professional nursing practice should be a baccalaureate degree education in nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/Policy-Advocacy/State/Legislative-Agenda-Reports/NursingEducation/NursingEducationCompendium.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829144750/http://www.nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/Policy-Advocacy/State/Legislative-Agenda-Reports/NursingEducation/NursingEducationCompendium.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Medicine (IOM) affirmed in 2010 that nurses should achieve higher levels of education and training through an improved education system that promotes seamless academic progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2010/The-Future-of-Nursing-Leading-Change-Advancing-Health/Recommendations.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809105918/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2010/The-Future-of-Nursing-Leading-Change-Advancing-Health/Recommendations.aspx |archivedate=2011-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==
The [[Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education]] (CCNE)&lt;ref name=CCNE&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education|url=http://www.aacn.nche.edu/ccne-accreditation/about/mission-values-history|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Nursing|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708231254/http://www.aacn.nche.edu/ccne-accreditation/about/mission-values-history|archivedate=2014-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing]] (ACEN)&lt;ref name=ACEN/&gt; are the accreditation bodies for Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs in the United States. Both Commissions are officially recognized as national [[Higher education accreditation in the United States|accreditation agencies]] that ensure quality standards for undergraduate to graduate nursing programs by the [[United States Secretary of Education]].&lt;ref name=ACEN&gt;{{cite web|title=Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN)|url=http://www.acenursing.net/acenursing/ACEN/|publisher=Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing|accessdate=16 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927035942/http://www.acenursing.net/acenursing/ACEN/|archivedate=27 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CCNE/&gt;

==Accelerated BSN programs==
Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs allow those who already have a bachelor's degree in a non-nursing field to obtain their nursing degree at an accelerated rate, which is why they are also commonly referred to as "Second Degree Nursing Programs." These programs usually have strict prerequisites because the program coursework focuses solely on nursing.  Accelerated BSN programs are typically anywhere from 12–20 months.

==BSc Nursing top-up programs==
The program is intended specifically for nurses with a diploma or certification in nursing who wish to top-up their current academic qualifications towards a full Bachelor of Science in Nursing. In order to keep the program up-to-date and relevant to the current healthcare system, the course material is updated regularly with feedback from registered nurses, nurse managers, healthcare professionals and even patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.staffordglobal.org/psychology-health-courses/nursing-bsc-online-edinburgh-napier|title=BSc Nursing Top-up Online|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503184111/https://www.staffordglobal.org/psychology-health-courses/nursing-bsc-online-edinburgh-napier|archivedate=2018-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BSN entry level into nursing in the future==
Among nurse educators, arguments continue about the ideal balance of practical preparation and the need to educate the future practitioner to manage healthcare and to have a broader view of the practice. To meet both requirements, nurse education aims to develop a lifelong learner who can adapt effectively to changes in both the theory and practice of nursing.  Degree programs were created in the 1950s and 1960s to quickly fix the nursing shortage, and while today there is still a nursing shortage concern due to the fact that the current nursing census is made up of more than 50% of nurses above the age of 55 years old and upon retiring will create a huge nursing deficit, there is still the aim to promote higher level educated nurses at the entry level into one's nursing career.  "Recent changes in the scope of nursing practice have many hospitals are looking to select only BSN-trained nurses and are requiring current AD nurses to further their education to acquire the BSN degree.  Magnet hospitals typically employ greater numbers of BSN-prepared nurses and currently require that all nurse managers and nurse leaders hold degrees at the BSN level or higher"&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Sarver, W., Cichra, N., &amp; Kline, M. (2015). Perceived benefits, motivators, and barriers to advancing nurse education: Removing Barriers to Improve Success. Nursing Education Perspectives (National League for Nursing), 36(3), 153-156. {{doi|10.5480/14-1407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 The Institute of Medicine recommended that by 2020, 80 percent of RNs hold a bachelor of science in nursing (BSN) degree&lt;ref&gt;Sarver, W., Cichra, N., &amp; Kline, M. (2015). Perceived benefits, motivators, and barriers to advancing nurse education: Removing Barriers to Improve Success. Nursing Education Perspectives (National League forNursing), 36(3), 153-156. {{doi|10.5480/14-1407}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was also noted in a report titled: Institute of Medicine’s report on the Future of Nursing, and has been followed by a campaign to implement its recommendations. In this report a 2nd recommendation was made to focus on increasing the proportion of registered nurses (RNs) with a baccalaureate degree to 80% by 2020. Towards that effort the report recommends that educational associations, colleges, delivery organizations, governmental organizations, and funders develop the resources necessary to support this goal. These recommendations are consistent with other policy initiatives currently underway; for example, legislation requiring that nurses receive a baccalaureate degree within 10 years of initial licensure has been considered in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aahs.org/aamcnursing/wp-content/uploads/Baccalaureate-Education-in-Nursing-and-Patient-Outcomes.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809152033/http://www.aahs.org/aamcnursing/wp-content/uploads/Baccalaureate-Education-in-Nursing-and-Patient-Outcomes.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous states that are looking to propose a “BSN-in-10” legislation in order to increase the number of BSN-prepared nurses. "This legislation would require newly licensed AD or diploma nurses to earn a BSN within 10 years of initial licensure" The Department of Health and Human Services have noted that they feel that in light of the fact that many RN-to-BSN programs offer distance learning options, the 10-year deadline is thought to be appropriate.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Many of these recommendations are being driven by recent studies regarding patient outcomes and nursing education. Hospitals employing higher percentages of BSN-prepared nurses have shown an associated decrease in morbidity, mortality, and failure-to-rescue rates. Increasing the percentage of BSN nurses employed decreases by 10 percent the 30-day inpatient mortality and failure-to-rescue rates&lt;ref&gt;Sarver, W., Cichra, N., &amp; Kline, M. (2015). Perceived benefits, motivators, and barriers to advancing nurse education: Removing Barriers to Improve Success. Nursing Education Perspectives (National League for Nursing), 36(3), 153-156&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies that provide this type of evidence-based practice encompass the ultimate purpose of a higher level of educated nurse workforce.  It adds to support the ultimate mission of the Texas Board of Nursing (BON or Board), which is to protect and promote the welfare of the people of Texas by ensuring that each person holding a license as a nurse in this state is competent to practice safely&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.bon.state.tx.us/pdfs/publication_pdfs/npa2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503184112/http://www.bon.state.tx.us/pdfs/publication_pdfs/npa2011.pdf |archivedate=2018-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an effort to improve patient outcomes, boost quality and lower costs healthcare leaders and institutions have increased expectations for evidence-based practice (EBP).  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) aim is that 90% of clinical decisions will be evidence-based by 2020 (IOM, 2010). As the largest group of healthcare providers, nurses have a pivotal role in meeting this goal)&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, M., Sleutel, M., Newcomb, P., Behan, D., Walsh, J., Wells, J. N., &amp; Baldwin, K. M.

'''Ben Kerr''' (1930 – June 17, 2005) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] author, broadcaster, musician and [[perennial candidate]], who was most famous as one of [[Toronto]], Ontario's quirky street performers.

==Background==
Kerr was born in [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]] and spent fifteen years in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] before settling in Toronto. In the 1960s, Kerr frequently played guitar in [[folk music|folk]] clubs in Toronto's [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] district working alongside groups such as [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[the Mynah Birds]], [[Rick James]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]] and [[Joni Mitchell]], and wrote songs for the then unknown [[Neil Young]].

In 1969, he had a life changing experience when he gave up his three pack a day smoking habit and started taking a daily [[cayenne pepper]] cocktail. He credited the concoction with turning his health around and saving his life.

For a time, he was an executive at the Toronto Harbour Commission. A fervent anti-[[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] crusader, he quit in a rage in 1981 when a co-worker blew smoke in his face. He wrote a song, "Fire on One End, a Fool on the Other", about the incident. This inspired him to run from Toronto to Los Angeles to promote a smoking ban in offices. The run took him six months. He was also in the 1982 [[Trees (American band)|Trees]] [[music video]] "Shock of the New", appearing as a guy with an [[oxygen mask]] and a shirt promoting clean air in offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trees - Shock of the New (1982)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je1Z5Hw0gEM|website=YouTube|accessdate=3 November 2017|date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1987, he played a dead man in the basement of [[Casa Loma]] in [https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._D._Benedikt B.D. Benedikt]'s ''Beyond the 7th Door''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beyond the 7th Door |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0321432/ |website=IMDB |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-retirement==
Kerr supported himself as a [[busking|busker]] for the remainder of his life, singing with a [[karaoke]] machine in front of the [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson's Bay]] department store at the corner of [[Yonge Street|Yonge]] and [[Bloor Street|Bloor]] streets. He was often voted "favourite street performer" in ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now Magazine]]'''s annual Toronto survey, and it is rumoured that Kerr was once offered a recording contract with [[Sub Pop Records]]. He continued to appear frequently on radio and television as an advocate for the health benefits of cayenne pepper, and was the author of ''The Cayenne Pepper Cocktail Does it All''.

As well, he was a [[perennial candidate|perennial fringe candidate]] who ran in every [[Mayor of Toronto|Toronto mayoral]] election from 1985 until 2003, the last municipal election held before his death. In 1997, he placed fourth behind [[Mel Lastman]], [[Barbara Hall (politician)|Barbara Hall]] and [[Don Andrews]]. In the [[Toronto municipal election, 2000|2000 election]], he ran on a platform of [[Toronto waterfront|waterfront renewal]], backed by the self-penned campaign song "Fringe Candidate".

Ben Kerr died on June 17, 2005 at his home on Jones Avenue in Toronto, at the age of 75. In 2007, [[Toronto City Council]] approved a motion to name a laneway near the corner of [[Danforth Avenue|Danforth]] and Jones in Kerr's honour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=https://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20070913.TORBRIEFS13-3%2FTPStory%2FTPNational%2FOntario%2F&amp;ord=248618&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true "Laneway is named in honour of candidate"], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', September 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Kerr Lane was officially named on May 25, 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8339">During the [[French and Indian War]], [[British Armed Forces|British military]] [[garrison ration|rations]] contained enough [[food energy]] to sustain the soldier in [[garrison]] but suffered from a lack of [[vitamins]] that could lead to [[Vitamins#Deficiencies|nutritional deficiencies]] if not supplemented by the soldiers themselves through garden produce or purchase. During field conditions, the energy content tended to be too small. Colonial rations for provincial troops generally had a higher energy content.

During the [[French and Indian Wars|colonial wars]] the regular army was provisioned according to victualing acts enacted by the [[British Parliament]]. During the [[French and Indian War]] the daily allowance was as follows:

Women permitted to accompany the army received half a ration per day, and children a quarter ration. Fresh [[bread]] and [[meat]] could be substituted with fresh or salt [[pork]], [[hardtack]], [[flour]] or [[corn meal]]. Additional provisions such as [[fruit]]s, [[vegetables]] and [[cheese]]s were issued when available.&lt;ref name="Victuals"&gt;[http://44thregiment.itgo.com/victuals.html ''Victuals''] Retrieved June 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutritional value==
The enacted daily allowance had an energy content of 2,400 to 3,100 [[Calorie|kcal]] per day, which was enough for [[garrison]] duty, but during field conditions it had to be supplemented in order to give sufficient energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8DjI7BGC1QoC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=food+and+rations+army+seven+years+war&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hUt7qhBe9Z&amp;sig=22fjE9C5ThAShCKOufjVm57f3qg&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=InznT5mnDM3E4gSLgsmbAQ&amp;ved=0CHoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=food%20and%20rations%20army%20seven%20years%20war&amp;f=false Douglas Cubbison, ''The American Northern Theater Army in 1776'' (McFarland &amp; Company 2010), p. 21.] Retrieved June 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The main shortcoming was the lack of fresh food, especially fresh vegetables, which often led to outbreaks of [[scurvy]], both in the field and in garrison.

Fresh food was also easily spoiled during hot summers.&lt;ref name="Victuals"/&gt;

==Supplements==
[[File:Vegetable garden at Colonial Williamsburg - Stierch.jpg|thumb|Garden with [[lettuce]] cultivated in an 18th-century manner]]
In [[garrison]] the regular ration was supplemented with vegetables from gardens tended by the soldiers during their spare time. [[Turnip]]s, [[carrot]]s and [[cabbage]] were the most common [[crops]]. Soldiers in towns could also buy food in the civilian marketplace, but at border forts or in the field, they were limited to what the [[sutler]]s sold. The margin for such purchases was limited, however, due to the many stoppages taken from the soldiers' pay, among them the cost for the issued ration.&lt;ref name="Select"&gt;[http://www.csmid.com/files/rations.html ''The British Army Ration''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904202115/http://www.csmid.com/files/rations.html |date=September 4, 2013 }} Retrieved June 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; While marching through populated areas, the soldiers frequently resorted to [[foraging]], often a euphemism for theft and robbery of food from the citizenry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readbookonline.net/read/54245/102402/ Benjamin Franklin, ''The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin'', Chapter 16.

==Colonial rations==
Provincial troops under local command were supplied according to colonial victualing regulations. They were more generous than the Victualing Act. The Massachusetts military ration had in addition to the British ration {{1/2}} pound (225 grams) sugar, 1 pint (47 centiliters) molasses and 7 gills (82 centiliters) of [[rum]] per week. When provincial troops formed part of the field army they were provisioned through the regular army supply chain and rations were issued according to the Victualing Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicaltrekking.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=31637&amp;sid=0a69db51761736c2cf241996710e5957 ''1756 Mass Bay Colony Soldiers Rations''] Retrieved June 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pennsylvania's Militia Supply Act of 1755, the weekly ration was 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) of meat, 1 pound (455 grams) of fish, 10{{1/2}} pounds (4.8 kilograms) of bread and 7 gills (82 centiliters) of rum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twipa.blogspot.se/2012/11/the-diet-of-frontier-soldier-during.html ''The Diet of the Frontier Soldier during the French and Indian War''] Retrieved January 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooking==
Rations for several days were issued at the same time to messes of 5-6 soldiers who also shared a tent. Each mess was issued a camp kettle and a camp axe. The food was cooked in the camp kettles over open fires burning in fire pits. The meat ration was usually boiled together with other ingredients to make a thick soup.&lt;ref name="Victuals"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmid.com/files/messleader.html ''The Mess Group Leader's Guide''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203025610/http://www.csmid.com/files/messleader.html |date=December 3, 2013 }} 2012-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bread was baked by civilian bakers and the bread ration issued every fourth day as a six-pound loaf. Fresh bread could be replaced by [[hardtack]], made by civilian bakeries and kept in storage. At worst only flour was issued, and the soldiers had to use it as best they could; either mixing it into the heavy soup or by making [[firecake]]s.&lt;ref name="Select"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Historic Valley Forge'' [http://www.ushistory.org/valleyforge/youasked/066.htm Firecake Recipe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804190920/http://www.ushistory.org/valleyforge/youasked/066.htm |date=August 4, 2013 }} 2012-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brussels Agreement''' (formally the '''International Agreement respecting Facilities to be given to Merchant Seamen for the Treatment of Venereal Diseases''') is a 1924 [[multilateral treaty]] whereby states agreed to provide free or low-cost medical facilities in [[port]]s where [[merchant shipping|merchant seamen]] could be treated for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.

The Brussels Agreement was concluded in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] on 1 December 1924. The treaty entered into force on 21 November 1925. The Agreement was widely ratified and its effects were studied by a 1958 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) study group. The WHO determined that the Agreement had been successful at improving the health of merchant seamen. The treaty remains in force for 70 states. It was most recently ratified by [[Papua New Guinea]], in 1977.

[[Belgium]] is the official depositary for the treaty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4563">Developed by  Carstairs and Morris (1991)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deprivation and Health in Scotland |last1=Carstairs |first1=V. |last2=Morris |first2 = R. |publisher=Aberdeen University Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the '''Carstairs index''' is an [[index of deprivation]] used in [[spatial epidemiology]] to identify Socio-economic [[confounding]]. Developed for Scotland it was an alternative to the [[Townsend Deprivation Index|Townsend Index]] of deprivation to avoid the use of households as denominators&lt;ref&gt;Elliott P, Cuzick J, English D, Stern R. Geographical and Environmental Epidemiology. Methods for Small-Area Studies. Oxford University Press. New York, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Carstairs index is based on four Census variables: low social class, lack of car ownership, overcrowding and [[male unemployment]] and the overall index reflects the material deprivation of an area, in relation to the rest of Scotland. Carstairs indices are calculated at the postcode sector level, with average population sizes of approximately 5,000 persons. 

The Carstairs index makes use of data collected at the Census to calculate the relative deprivation of an area, therefore there have been four versions: 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011. The Carstairs indices are routinely produced and [https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/healthwellbeing/research/mrccsosocialandpublichealthsciencesunit/programmes/inequalities/carstairsscores/ published] by the MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit at the University of Glasgow.

|Male unemployment

|Lack of car ownership
|The proportion of all persons in private households which do not own a car.

|Overcrowding
|The proportion of all persons living in private households with a density of more than one person per room
|-
|Low social class
|The proportion of all persons in private households with an economically active head of household in social class IV or V
|}

== Calculating the Index ==

The components of the Carstairs score are unweighted, and so to ensure that they all have equal influence over the final score, each variable is standardised to have a populatation-weighted mean of zero, and a variance of one, using the [[z-score]] method.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Carstairs index for each area is the sum of the standardised values of the components. Indices may be positive or negative, with negative scores indicating that the area has a lower level of deprivation, and positive scores suggesting the area has a relatively higher level of deprivation. 

The indices are typically ordered from lowest to highest, and grouped into population quintiles. In the 1981, 1991 and 2001 indices, quintile 1 represented the least &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hsq/health-statistics-quarterly/no--31--autumn-2006/measuring-deprivation-in-england-and-wales-using-2001-carstairs-scores.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; deprived areas, and quintile 5, represented the most deprived. In 2011, the order was reversed, in line with the ordering of the [[Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D., Allik, M. , Dundas, R. and Leyland, A. H.

MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow, Glasgow. http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/99555/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Changes to the variables ==

The low social class component of the 1981 and 1991 Carstairs index was created using the Registrar General's Social Class (later Social Class for Occupation). In 2001, this was superseded by the [[National Statistics Socio-economic Classification]] (NS-SEC). This meant that the definition of low social class had to be amended to reflect the approximate operational categories.&lt;ref&gt;McLoone, P. (2004) Carstairs scores for Scottish Postcode sectors from the 2001 Census. MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow&lt;/ref&gt; 

The definition of overcrowding was amended between 1981 and 1991, due to the inclusion of kitchens of at least 2 metres wide into the room count in the Census.&lt;ref&gt;McLoone, P. (1994) Carstairs Scores for Scottish Postcode Sectors from the 1991 Census.

The Comedy Gala was first commissioned by Channel 4 Entertainment Commissioning Editor, Syeda Irtizaali.&lt;ref name=Channel4Sales11Feb2010/&gt; Tickets first went on sale on 12 February 2010 for the live show at the O2 Arena, scheduled for 30 March 2010.&lt;ref name=Channel4Sales11Feb2010/&gt; With over 25 performers taking part, Channel 4 promoted the first gala as "the biggest live stand up show in United Kingdom history", and "the comedy event of the year".&lt;ref name=Channel4Sales11Feb2010/&gt; Hinting that there may be more Channel 4 Comedy Galas in the future, as Jack Dee closed the first show with the line "we'll see you next year, thank you and goodnight".

Hailing the first gig as a big hit both in terms of fund raising and for viewers, Irtizaali commissioned a second gala again at the O2, with tickets going on sale on 11 March 2011, and the gig scheduled for 24 May 2011.&lt;ref name=Chortle11Mar2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mirror10Mar2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Channel411Mar2011/&gt;

All profits from ticket and DVD sales of the Comedy Galas go to [[Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity]].&lt;ref name=Channel4Sales11Feb2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=OffTheKerbHomepage30Mar2010/&gt; All performers waive their fees for the shows.&lt;ref name=Channel4Sales11Feb2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chortle11Mar2011/&gt; The first gala raised nearly £1 million, enabling a new [[anaesthetic]] room to be built, while the second gala is to raise funds for a new £5m operating theatre.&lt;ref name=Mirror10Mar2011/&gt; At every Gala during the ad breaks some adverts are hijacked by [[Alan Carr]] and/or [[Jimmy Carr]].

The '''Client Access to Integrated Services and Information''' (CAISI) project aims to reduce the plight of chronic [[homelessness]] by enhancing the integration of care between agencies at the individual and population levels using an electronic information system.  As such, the project goals can be summarized as:

* development of an [[Open-source software|open source]] project that leverages [[Oscarmcmaster|OSCAR McMaster]],
* integrating shelter and health care information for homeless people,
* and by using the system, building community and agency capacity.

The project builds on Seaton House - [[St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto)|St. Michael's Hospital]] SHIFE experience, the [[Toronto]] District Health Council Discharge planning Toolkit, and the Homeless Health Reference Group.

== History==
The CAISI project received funding approval in 2004, and officially began operations on April 1, 2005.

'''Dignitas''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] non-profit members' society providing assisted/accompanied suicide to those members of the organisation who suffer from [[terminal illness]] and/or severe physical and/or mental illnesses, supported by (of the organization independent) qualified Swiss doctors. They have assisted over 2,100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dignitas.ch/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=72&amp;lang=en|title=Statistics|first=|last=Karin|date=|website=www.dignitas.ch|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; people die at home within Switzerland and at Dignitas' house/flat near [[Zürich]]. Additionally, they do advisory work on [[palliative care]], health care advance directive and suicide attempt prevention, and they have been leading and supporting numerous court cases and legislation projects for right-to-die laws around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dignitas.ch/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=6&amp;lang=en|title=Latest News / Blog|first=|last=Karin|date=|website=www.dignitas.ch|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Members of Dignitas who wish for an assisted suicide have to be of sound judgement, themselves able to do the last act which brings about death, and submit a formal request including a letter explaining their wish to die and most of all medical reports showing diagnosis and treatments tried. For people with severe psychiatric illnesses, additionally, an in-depth medical report prepared by a psychiatrist that establishes the patient's condition, is required as per a Swiss Supreme Court decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://relevancy.bger.ch/php/clir/http/index.php?lang=de&amp;type=show_document&amp;page=1&amp;from_date=&amp;to_date=&amp;from_year=1954&amp;to_year=2014&amp;sort=relevance&amp;insertion_date=&amp;from_date_push=&amp;top_subcollection_clir=bge&amp;query_words=&amp;part=all&amp;de_fr=&amp;de_it=&amp;fr_de=&amp;fr_it=&amp;it_de=&amp;it_fr=&amp;orig=&amp;translation=&amp;rank=0&amp;highlight_docid=atf%3A%2F%2F133-I-58%3Ade&amp;number_of_ranks=0&amp;azaclir=clir#page240 |title=Supreme Court of Switzerland, decision BGE 133 I 58 of November 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and operation ==
Dignitas was founded 17 May 1998 by [[Ludwig Minelli]], a Swiss lawyer specialising in human rights law. Swiss laws provide that assistance to suicide is legal as long as it is not motivated by selfish motives. 

The person who wishes to die meets several Dignitas personnel, in addition to an independent medical doctor, for a private consultation. The independent doctor assesses the evidence provided by the patient in advance and is met on two separate occasions, with a time gap between each of the consultations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/7774802.stm |title=Paralysed player killed himself |publisher=BBC News |date=December 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legally admissible proof that the person wishes to die is also created, in the form of a signed affidavit, countersigned by independent witnesses. In cases where a person is physically unable to sign a document, a short video film of the person is made in which they are asked to confirm their identity, that they wish to die, and that their decision is made of their own free will, without any form of persuasion / coercion. This evidence of [[informed consent]] remains private and is preserved only for use in any possible legal dispute.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Finally, a few minutes before the lethal overdose is provided, the person is once again reminded that taking the overdose will surely kill them. Additionally, they are asked several times whether they want to proceed, or take some time to consider the matter further. This gives the person the opportunity to stop the process at any time. However, if at this point the person states that they are determined to proceed, a lethal overdose is provided and ingested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1093139/If-drink-die-What-paralysed-rugby-boy-told-took-poison-Swiss-suicide.html |title='If you drink this, you will die': Father reveals what paralysed rugby son was told before he took poison in Swiss suicide |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=December 11, 2008 |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suicide method ===
In general, Dignitas uses the following protocol to assist suicides: an oral dose of an [[antiemetic]] drug, followed approximately half an hour later by a lethal [[Drug overdose|overdose]] of 15 grams of powdered [[pentobarbital]] &lt;!--(The following source says both 15g and 15mg!:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/nov/18/assisted-suicide-dignitas-house |work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Inside the Dignitas house | first=Amelia | last=Gentleman | date=November 18, 2009 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;)--&gt; dissolved in a glass of water. If necessary, the drugs can be ingested via a drinking straw. The pentobarbital overdose depresses the [[central nervous system]], causing the person to become drowsy and fall asleep within 3–5 minutes of drinking it. [[Anaesthesia]] progresses to coma and later, as the person's breathing becomes more shallow, followed by [[respiratory arrest]] and death, which occurs within 30–40 minutes of ingesting the pentobarbital.

Exceptionally, in four cases in 2008, Dignitas used breathing [[helium]] gas&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel_interview" /&gt; as a suicide method instead of a pentobarbital overdose. 
The medical supervision was still observed, however, the prescription controlled drugs avoided, which reduced the risk of the medical board / authorities harassing the medical doctor giving a "green light" for the accompanied suicide.

=== Referendum ===
In two [[referendum]]s on 15 May 2011, voters in the [[Canton of Zürich]] overwhelmingly rejected calls to ban assisted suicide or to outlaw the practice for non-residents. Out of more than 278,000 ballots cast, the initiative to ban assisted suicide was rejected by 85 per cent of voters and the initiative to outlaw it for non-residents was turned down by 78 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/switzerland/8515258/Zurich-votes-to-keep-suicide-tourism-alive.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Zurich votes to keep 'suicide tourism' alive | date=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/zurich-voters-keep-suicide-tourism-alive/ |title=Zurich voters keep "suicide tourism" alive | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/05/15/zurich-voters-suicide-tourism-alive/ | work=Fox News | title=Zurich voters keep 'suicide tourism' alive | date=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistics ===
Ludwig Minelli said in an interview in March 2008 that Dignitas had assisted 840 people to die, 60% of them Germans.&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel_interview"&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/Sterbehilfe-Dignitas-Minelli;art1117,2502357 Wenn Sie das trinken, gibt es kein Zurück] ''Tagesspiegel.de'' Retrieved April 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, that number had exceeded a thousand assisted suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/03/death-becomes-him/307916/?single_page=true | title=Death Becomes Him | publisher=The Atlantic | date=March 2010 | accessdate=October 25, 2012 | author=Bruce Falconer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people contacting Dignitas do not plan to die but need insurance in case their illness becomes intolerable. Of those who receive the so-called "provisional green light", 70% never return to Dignitas.&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel_interview" /&gt;

21% of people receiving assisted suicide in Dignitas do not have a terminal or progressive illness, but rather "weariness of life".&lt;ref name="Fischer-2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = S. | last2 = Huber | first2 = CA. | last3 = Imhof | first3 = L. | last4 = Mahrer Imhof | first4 = R. | last5 = Furter | first5 = M. | last6 = Ziegler | first6 = SJ. | last7 = Bosshard | first7 = G. | title = Suicide assisted by two Swiss right-to-die organisations. | journal=J Med Ethics | volume = 34 | issue = 11 | pages = 810–4 |date=Nov 2008 | doi = 10.1136/jme.2007.023887 | PMID = 18974416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costs and finances ===
According to the official Dignitas website,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dignitas.ch/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=5&amp;lang=en|title=Brochure of DIGNITAS|first=|date=|website=www.dignitas.ch|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of 2017 Dignitas charges its patients 7,000 Swiss Francs (approx. £5,180 / $7,980) for preparation and suicide assistance, or 10,500 Swiss Francs (approx. £7,770 / $11,970) in case of taking over family duties, including funerals, medical costs and official fees. Dignitas has been known to waive certain costs where there is hardship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/jun/15/assisted-suicide-dignitas-cutkelvin-laws Man who helped partner die calls for assisted suicide law change], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Under Swiss Law, Dignitas operates as a non-profit organization, but does not open its finances to the public,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/31/AR2005103101824.html Branching Out to Serve a Growing but Dying Market] ''[[Washington Post]]'', November 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; which has elicited criticism from some quarters.

=== 'Suicide tourism' ===
{{Main|Suicide tourism}}

Although mainly Germans turn to Dignitas for so called 'assisted suicide', as of August 2015, approximately 300 British citizens have travelled to [[Switzerland]] from the UK to die at one of Dignitas' rented apartments in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/15/assisted-dying-britons-dignitas-rises-campaigners-change-law | work=Guardian | title= ‘One person a fortnight’ travels to Dignitas from Britain to end their lives | date=August 15, 2015 | accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations by Dignitas ex-employee ===
Soraya Wernli (a nurse employed by Dignitas for two-and-a-half years, until March 2005), accused the organization of being a 'production line of death concerned only with profits'.&lt;ref name="''Daily Mail'' "&gt;{{cite news|author=Allan Hall |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1127413/Cashing-despair-Suicide-clinic-Dignitas-profit-obsessed-killing-machine-claims-ex-worker.html |title=Cashing in on despair?

=== Reaction of local Swiss people and authorities ===
Dignitas-founder Ludwig Minelli describes the difficulties that Dignitas has faced over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ludwig A. Minelli, Secretary-General, Attorney-at-law|title=Friends At The End (FATE)|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306193345/http://www.dignitas.ch/WeitereTexte/FriendsAtTheEnd.pdf|website=web.archive.org|accessdate=17 December 2017|archivedate=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sept 2007, it was evicted, blocked or locked out of three flats, and so Mr Minelli offered assisted suicide in his private house. This, however, was then prohibited by the local council. In October 2007, Dignitas was again prevented from working in a private house by the local council and refused rooms on an industrial site. In December 2007, an interim judgment prevented Dignitas from working in a building next to a busy brothel. The media frenzy led to several people offering Dignitas flats or houses, of which one turned out to be suitable. Since 2009, Dignitas has a house at an undisclosed location where accompanied suicide for people from abroad has taken place.

=== Patient selection ===
In certain right-to-die organisations, an age restriction is in place for potential patients, so as to prevent young people from using their services.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer S. Huber CA. Imhof L. Mahrer Imhof R. Furter M. Ziegler SJ. Bosshard G. Suicide assisted by two Swiss right-to-die organization's, example zalia cyrilia an African was suffering from cancer only paid 2000 to get killed. ''Journal of Medical Ethics.'' 2008; '''34'''(11):810-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cremation urns found in Lake Zürich===
In April 2010, private divers found a group of over 60 [[cremation]] [[urns]] in [[Lake Zürich]]. Each of the urns bore the logo of the Zürich Nordheim crematorium also used by Dignitas. Soraya Wernli, a former employee, had told ''[[The Times]]'' 18 months previously that Dignitas had dumped at least 300 urns in the lake. She claimed that Minelli dumped them there himself, but later asked his daughter and another member of staff to do it. In 2008, allegedly two members of Dignitas were caught trying to pour the ashes of 20 dead people into the
lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7109939.ece |work=The Times | location=London | title=Ashes dumped in Lake Zurich put Dignitas back in the spotlight | first=Roger | last=Boyes | date=April 28, 2010 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2949423/Dignitas-urns-dumped-in-lake.html | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Nick | last=Parker | title=Dignitas urns dumped in lake | date=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was never established whether Dignitas had anything to do with it and no charges were taken. In Switzerland, it is not against the law to scatter cremation ashes out into nature.

=== Dignitas in media ===
In 2008, the documentary film ''[[Right to Die?]]'' was broadcast on [[Sky Real Lives]] (rebroadcast on [[PBS]] [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] in March 2010 as ''The Suicide Tourist''). Directed by Oscar-winning Canadian [[John Zaritsky]], it depicts the assisted suicide of several people who have gone to Switzerland to end their lives.{{cn|date=August 2018}} It includes the story of [[Craig Ewert]], a 59-year-old retired university professor who suffered from a motor neurone disease. Ewert traveled to Switzerland where he was assisted by the Dignitas NGO. The documentary shows him passing away with Mary, his wife of 37 years, at his side. It was shown on the Swiss television network [[SF 1|SF1]] and is available as a web movie on the Dignitas website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081213065631/http://www.dignitas.ch/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=142&amp;Itemid=115|title=DIGNITAS - Dokumentarfilm |author=|date=13 December 2008|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC produced a film titled ''[[A Short Stay in Switzerland]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1120681/Anne-drink-die-Why-stood-allowed-mother-commit-suicide.html Daily Mail Online: 'Anne, if you drink this you will die': Why we stood by and allowed our mother to commit suicide] By Andrea Thompson&lt;/ref&gt; telling the story of Dr Anne Turner, who made the journey to the Dignitas assisted suicide clinic. On January 24, 2006, the day before her 67th birthday, she ended her life. The film was shown on BBC1 on January 25, 2009.

British maestro Sir [[Edward Downes]], who conducted the [[BBC Philharmonic]] and the Royal Opera but struggled in recent years (but was not terminally ill) as his hearing and sight failed, died with his wife, who had terminal cancer, at an assisted suicide clinic in Switzerland in July 2009. He was 85 and she was 74.&lt;ref name="CB1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=7887| title=YOUthanasia| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |date=August 2, 2009| publisher=Criminal Brief| accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French lesbian theorist and translator [[Michele Causse]] chose to die on her birthday, July 29, 2010, in association with Dignitas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.francesoir.fr/litterature/la-mort-de-michele-causse |title=France Soir |work=France Soir |location=France |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806110132/http://www.francesoir.fr/litterature/la-mort-de-michele-causse |archivedate=August 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://michele-causse.com/ Michele Causse&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2011, [[BBC Two]] aired a documentary titled ''[[Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die]]'', featuring author and Alzheimer's disease sufferer Sir [[Terry Pratchett]] guiding viewers through an assisted suicide which took place at Dignitas facilities in Switzerland. Peter Smedley, a British hotelier and millionaire, and his wife Christine allowed for Pratchett to film Smedley's deliberate consumption of prepared [[barbiturate]] in a glass in order to kill himself as Christine comforted Smedley in his demise. The documentary received a highly polarized reaction in the United Kingdom, with much praise for the programme as "brave", "sensitive"&lt;ref&gt;

Dignitas continued to be presented in the media as a political stance on the right to die. BBC featured an article regarding the death of UK citizen Jeffrey Spector, a businessman who decided to travel to Switzerland to undergo assisted suicide through Dignitas for an inoperable tumour which most likely would have caused paralysis later on in its development. This situation reignited the debate revolving around the morality of assisted suicides in certain dilemmas, and incited current stances concerning euthanasia. Former Lord Chancellor [[Charlie Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Lord Falconer]] said he would "attempt to reintroduce a bill that would allow assisted dying in the UK".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-32881161|title=St Annes businessman Jeffrey Spector dies at Dignitas|date=May 26, 2015|work=BBC |accessdate=May 26, 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the book ''[[Me Before You]]'' and the [[Me Before You (film)|movie]] discuss the organization as it serves a vital function in both the main plot and the characters' lives.

'''Estrogen-related receptor gamma''' ('''ERR-gamma'''), also known as '''NR3B3''' (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group B, member 3), is a [[nuclear receptor]] that in humans is encoded by the ESRRG (EStrogen Related Receptor Gamma) [[gene]].&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: ESRRG estrogen-related receptor gamma| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=2104| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9676434"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eudy JD, Yao S, Weston MD, Ma-Edmonds M, Talmadge CB, Cheng JJ, Kimberling WJ, Sumegi J | title = Isolation of a gene encoding a novel member of the nuclear receptor superfamily from the critical region of Usher syndrome type IIa at 1q41 | journal = Genomics | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 382–4 | date = Jun 1998 | pmid = 9676434 | doi = 10.1006/geno.1998.5345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10072763"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen F, Zhang Q, McDonald T, Davidoff MJ, Bailey W, Bai C, Liu Q, Caskey CT | title = Identification of two hERR2-related novel nuclear receptors utilizing bioinformatics and inverse PCR | journal = Gene | volume = 228 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 101–9 | date = Mar 1999 | pmid = 10072763 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-1119(98)00619-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription.&lt;ref name="matsushima"/&gt;

This protein is a member of [[nuclear receptor|nuclear hormone receptor]]  family of [[steroid hormone receptor]]s.

There is evidence that bisphenol A functions as an [[endocrine disruptor]] by binding strongly to ERR-γ.&lt;ref name="matsushima"/&gt; BPA as well as its nitrated and chlorinated metabolites seems to binds strongly to ERR-γ ([[dissociation constant]] = 5.5 nM), but not to the [[estrogen receptor]] (ER).,&lt;ref name="matsushima"/&gt;&lt;ref name="babu"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Babu S, Vellore NA, Kasibotla AV, Dwayne HJ, Stubblefield MA, Uppu RM | title = Molecular docking of bisphenol A and its nitrated and chlorinated metabolites onto human estrogen-related receptor-gamma | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 426 | issue = 2 | pages = 215–20 | date = Sep 2012 | pmid = 22935422 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.065 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BPA binding to ERR-γ preserves its basal constitutive activity.&lt;ref name=matsushima/&gt; It can also protect it from deactivation from the [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] [[4-hydroxytamoxifen]].&lt;ref name="matsushima"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsushima A, Kakuta Y, Teramoto T, Koshiba T, Liu X, Okada H, Tokunaga T, Kawabata S, Kimura M, Shimohigashi Y | title = Structural evidence for endocrine disruptor bisphenol A binding to human nuclear receptor ERR gamma | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 142 | issue = 4 | pages = 517–24 | date = Oct 2007 | pmid = 17761695 | doi = 10.1093/jb/mvm158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different expression of ERR-γ in different parts of the body may account for variations in bisphenol A effects. For instance, ERR-γ has been found in high concentration in the [[placenta]], explaining reports of high bisphenol A accumulation there.&lt;ref name="pmid19304792"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takeda Y, Liu X, Sumiyoshi M, Matsushima A, Shimohigashi M, Shimohigashi Y | title = Placenta expressing the greatest quantity of bisphenol A receptor ERR{gamma} among the human reproductive tissues: Predominant expression of type-1 ERRgamma isoform | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 146 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–22 | date = Jul 2009 | pmid = 19304792 | doi = 10.1093/jb/mvp049 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eucharius Rösslin (Roslin, Rößlin)''', sometimes known as '''Eucharius Rhodion''', (c. 1470 &amp;ndash; 1526) was a [[Germany|German]] [[physician]] who in 1513 authored a book about [[childbirth]] called ''Der Rosengarten'' (The Rose Garden), which became a standard medical text for [[midwife|midwives]].

==Midwifery==
Rösslin was an [[apothecary]] at [[Freiburg]] before being elected physician to the city of [[Frankfurt on Main]] in 1506.  He served as physician to the city of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in the service of [[Catherine of Pomerania-Wolgast|Katherine]], wife of [[Henry IV, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]]. While examining and supervising the city's midwives, he found their practice of [[midwifery]] to be careless and substandard, leading to high rates of [[infant mortality]]. As a result, he wrote his book in German, to make it accessible, and published it in the then-German city of [[Strasbourg]]. He included in it [[engraving]]s by Martin Caldenbach, a pupil of [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Thereby ''Der Rosengarten'' gave for the first time printed illustrations of the [[birthing chair]], the lying-in chamber, and the positions of the [[fetus]] [[Uterus|in utero]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polybiblio.com/watbooks/2149.html Rösslin, Eucharius, De partu hominis, et quae circa ipsum accidunt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006080839/http://www.polybiblio.com/watbooks/2149.html |date=2007-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside his direct observation of midwifery at Worms, Rösslin incorporated information gleaned from writers of antiquity such as [[Muscio]] and [[Soranus (Greek Physician)|Soranus]] of [[Ephesus]]. In the introductory prologue to the text, written in verse, Rosslin emphasizes the importance of the role of men in [[reproduction]] and blames midwives who "through neglect and oversight... destroy children far and wide."  He threatens midwives with a warning that [[God]] will call them to account.  "And since no midwife that I've asked / Could tell me anything of her task / I'm left to my medical education."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-926988-2.pdf Oxford University Press]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
[[File:De partu hominis V00223 00000004.tif|thumb|''De partu hominis'']]

==Success==
The book was an immediate success. It then appeared in [[English language|English]] in 1540 as ''The Birth of Mankind''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localhistories.org/medicine.html A Brief History of Medicine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-16th century, it had been translated into all the main European languages and had gone through numerous editions.

Rösslin returned to his original job in Frankfurt in 1517, where he remained until his death in 1526.   

His son, Eucharius Rösslin the Younger, succeeded his father as town physician. He wrote a book on minerals and mineral use, and published a Latin translation of his father's book as ''De partu Hominis'' in 1532.

==''Der Rosengarten''==
&lt;blockquote&gt;And when the time of labour is come, in the same stoole ought to be put many clothes or crows in the backe of it, the which the midwife may remove from one side to another, according as necessity shall require. The Midwife her selfe shall sit before the labouring woman, and shall diligently observe and waite, how much, and after what meanes the child sitrreth itselfe: also shall with hands, first anoynted with the oyle of almonds or the oyle of those white lillies, rule and direct everything as shall seeme best.
  Also the midwife must instruct and comfort the party, not only refreshing her with good meate and drinke, but also with sweet words, giving her hope of a good speedie deliverance, encouraging and enstomacking her to patience and tolerance, bidding her to held in her breath as much as she may, also stroking gently with her hands her belly about the Navell, for that helpeth to depress the birth downeward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fn.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/79/1/F77 Fetal Neonatal Ed. – Sign In Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Faith and Health: Psychological Perspectives''''' is a book of scientific psychology on the relationship between [[Religion and health|religious faith and health]]. Edited by [[Thomas G. Plante]] and Allen C. Sherman, the book was published in the [[United States]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=fah01/&gt;

The book includes 16 chapters divided among four major parts that focus on general population outcomes (such as impacts on longevity), outcomes in special populations such as medical patients or adolescents, clinical implications, and overall criticisms and reflections.

''Faith and Health'' has been reviewed in several professional journals, including ''[[Contemporary Psychology]],''&lt;ref
    name=richards03/&gt;
''[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]]'',&lt;ref
    name=boehnlein02/&gt;
and others.&lt;ref

    name=martin02/&gt;

==Topics Covered==
''Faith and Health'' contains 16 chapters written by various psychological or biomedical researchers, and some of them are notable. Chapter titles and authors are listed in the table (''below, at right''). After an introductory chapter, the remaining 15 chapters are divided into four major parts.

The book's first part focuses on the faith/health relation in the general population. Chapter 2 by [[Carl E. Thoresen]] and his colleagues describes the existing empirical evidence, and discusses many methodological issues. The authors view the evidence as indicating that religious/spiritual factors "appear to be associated with physical, mental, and overall health, but the lack of adequate controls and designs in many studies has seriously limited our understanding of these relationships."&lt;ref name=ch2&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aDrzkyYQjqMC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=plante+%22appear+to+be+associated+with+physical,+mental,+and+overall+health%22#v=onepage&amp;q=plante%20%22appear%20to%20be%20associated%20with%20physical%2C%20mental%2C%20and%20overall%20health%22&amp;f=false Chapter 2, Thoresen, Harris &amp; Oman]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} The authors also note methodological challenges related to the need for more studies that follow participants over time, rather than observing them only once; the need to recognize that if religion and spirituality operate ''through'' other factors, they may be very influential but remain unrecognized, because they do not explain ''unique variance''; and the need for more ''[[experiment]]al'' studies. The authors also present a "working model... that tries to capture several factors that may be involved in the pathways connecting [religious/spiritual] factors with health,"&lt;ref name=ch2/&gt;{{rp|40}} and highlight four studies&lt;ref

In chapter 3, [[Michael McCullough (psychologist)|Michael McCullough]] reviewed evidence for relations between religious involvement and mortality. McCullough describes results of a [[meta-analysis]]&lt;ref name=mccullough2000&gt;McCullough (pp. 58, 73) cites this meta-analytic research to {{cite journal

A final chapter discussed how religiousness and spirituality is assessed in health research.

The second part focuses on faith and health in special populations. These include adolescents who are at risk for abusing [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol]], as well as survivors and sufferer from [[cancer]] and [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]]. The section also discusses how religious faith is related to [[mental health]] outcomes, such as [[Quality of life|well-being]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[substance abuse]], [[eating disorders]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[bipolar disorder]]s. It concluded that "Most research examining the relationship between religion and spirituality and mental health outcomes shows positive associations."&lt;ref name=ch10&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aDrzkyYQjqMC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=plante+sharma+%22religious+faith+and+mental+health+outcomes%22#v=onepage&amp;q=plante%20sharma%20%22religious%20faith%20and%20mental%20health%20outcomes%22&amp;f=false Chapter 10 Plante &amp; Sharma]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|254}}

Part three addresses implications of the faith/health relationships for the clinic. Chapters discuss implications for [[psychotherapy]], [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation medicine]]. A chapter by Tan and Dong offers dangers and guidelines for implementing spiritually-informed interventions that may include components such as [[meditation]], [[forgiveness]], [[prayer]], [[solitude]], the [[laying on of hands]], fellowship, and [[worship]], observing that "as health care providers implement religiously or spiritually oriented interventions, it is crucial that they do so with the utmost ethical caution and professional care."&lt;ref name=ch12&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aDrzkyYQjqMC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=tan+dong+%22spiritual+interventions+in+healing+and+wholeness%22#v=onepage&amp;q=tan%20dong%20%22spiritual%20interventions%20in%20healing%20and%20wholeness%22&amp;f=false Chapter 12, Tan and Dong]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|306}}

The fourth part contains commentaries on the previous chapters and on the literature. Timothy Smith wrote that "it is clear that matters of religion and spirituality are relevant to each of the foci of health psychology... [and] the emergence of this topic [of faith and health] seems long overdue."&lt;ref name=ch15&gt;Chapter 15, Smith&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|375}} He also cautioned that many results are "preliminary."&lt;ref name=ch15/&gt;{{rp|375}}
A chapter by Richard Sloan and his colleagues argued that no compelling evidence links religion and health, and that "concerns of patients about religion and health are best addressed by clergy, to whom referrals can readily be made."&lt;ref name=ch14&gt;Chapter 14, Sloan, Bagiella &amp; Powell&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|350}} A concluding chapter by the editors argued that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The interface between religion, spirituality, and health is an extraordinarily rich area for scientific investigation. For many, a concern with the sacred or transcendent goes to the heart of what it means to be human. Health professionals are beginning to appreciate the possibility that spiritual commitment may have relevance beyond the pew and the pulpit... I. the quest [to understand these issues] should be an exciting and provocative one.&lt;ref name=ch16&gt;Chapter 16, Plante &amp; Sherman.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|395–6}}

In ''[[Contemporary Psychology]]'', Richards and O'Grady wrote that "''Faith and Health'' takes us well beyond [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]], [[John B. Watson|Watson's]], [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner's]], and [[Albert Ellis|Ellis's]] oversimplified, negative views of religion and spirituality... [and] sets a high standard of methodological rigor, openness, and balance."&lt;ref name=richards03/&gt;

In the ''[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]]'', Boehnlein wrote that the editors' "primary focus, and stated goal, is to assess what is known about the relationship between health outcomes and faith [and they] are largely successful in achieving this goal. "&lt;ref name=boehnlein02/&gt; He also wrote that because it reviews so much quantitative research, the book is geared more towards researchers than towards clinicians, although there are a few chapters devoted to psychotherapy and rehabilitation.

In ''Families, Systems, &amp; Health'', King wrote that their "numerous publications"&lt;ref name=king02/&gt;{{rp|295}} attest to the editors' expertise in faith/health relations, and that the book is a "comprehensive look at research."&lt;ref name=king02/&gt;{{rp|295}} He wrote that he found "the book very useful
and will use it in both my practice and teaching... I plan to add a section on couples and health to my couples therapy class — an omission I recognized upon reading this informative book."&lt;ref name=king02/&gt;{{rp|296}}

In the ''[[Journal of Health Psychology]]'', Martin wrote that the book was "an unusually cohesive
collection of chapters that reviews current research endeavors, recent findings and critical controversies in this rapidly changing field,"&lt;ref name=martin02/&gt;{{rp|736}} and would make a "very nice text for a graduate-level seminar."&lt;ref name=martin02/&gt;{{rp|737}} Three "admirable"&lt;ref name=martin02/&gt;{{rp|736}} strengths include representative contributions by top researchers, a section on clinical application, and two solid methodological critiques that "lay out a framework for addressing problems that, left dormant, would fatally harm the discipline."&lt;ref name=martin02/&gt;{{rp|736–7}} Martin stated that one weakness was a lack of clear delineation of how definitions of spirituality and religion in particular chapters "overlap (or fail to) with similar definitions"&lt;ref name=martin02/&gt;{{rp|737}} of the constructs in other chapters. Another weakness was a lack of large-scale theoretical frameworks, although two chapters (2 and 5) provide "insightful discussion and examples of how [theoretical modeling] might be approached."&lt;ref name=martin02/&gt;{{rp|737}}

The published book also contained praise for the book by [[Norman B. Anderson|Norman Anderson]], [[Kenneth I. Pargament]], David M. Wulff, and [[Peter Salovey]].&lt;ref name=backcover&gt;Back cover (dust jacket) of ''Faith and Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2666">The '''Federal Coal Mine Safety Act of 1952''' is a U.S. law authorizing the federal government to conduct annual inspections of underground coal mines with more than 15 workers, and gave the [[United States Bureau of Mines]] the authority to shut down a mine in cases of "imminent danger."&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 82-552, 66 Stat. 692, July 16, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act authorized the assessment of [[Civil penalty|civil penalties]] against mine operators for failing to comply with an order to shut down (a "withdrawal order")&lt;ref name=crywolf/&gt; or for refusing to give inspectors access to mine property.  The law did not authorize monetary penalties for noncompliance with the safety provisions. In 1966, Congress extended coverage to all underground coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 89-376, Mar. 26, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act made ventilation mandatory in mines so as to limit the levels of [[methane]] in the air. It also required mine walls to be "dusted" with a [[limestone]] to limit the levels of coal dust.&lt;ref name=kub/&gt;

== History ==

Passage of the law responded to a [[West Frankfort, Illinois#1951 Coal Mine Explosion|1951 mine explosion]] which killed 111 miners in Illinois.&lt;ref name=kub&gt;Kubiszewski, Ida. 2008. [http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/152741 Federal Coal Mine Safety Act of 1952, United States].&lt;/ref&gt; [[President Truman]] signed the law on July 16, 1952.

Most regulation of mines was left to the U.S. states, and the Bureau of Mines or MSHA would get involved if either there were a disaster or a state agency request. Legislators apparently said that the federal 1952 law was oriented toward addressing the infrequent disasters in which five or more miners died, not preventing more common causes of deaths in mines.&lt;ref name=crywolf&gt;[http://crywolfproject.org/taxonomy/term/405 Coal Mine Safety Act of 1952] at crywolfproject.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Samuel Hurst''' (13 October 1927 – 4 July 2010) was a health physicist, scientist, inventor, educator and innovator. He developed the omnipresent [[touchscreen]] technology and single atom theory. Hurst spent his career at Oak Ridge National Laboratory where he was involved with: neutron survey meters; alpha survey meters; ionizing radiation dosimetry; gas ionization studies; Nevada Test Site gamma and neutron radiation measurements; vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation and the Jesse effect; time-of-flight investigations; electron swarm measurements; study of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki; radiation accident investigations; radiation dosimetry projects for NASA; microdosimetry; one-atom detection and single atom detection; solar neutrino experiments; magnetic monopole detectors; resonance ionization spectroscopy (RIS); and, sputter-initiated resonance ionization spectroscopy (SIRIS).

==Life and times==
Hurst was born on 13 October 1927 in the rural town of [[Ponza, Bell County, Kentucky|Ponza]], [[Bell County, Kentucky]] located near [[Pineville, Kentucky]]. His father was James H. Hurst and mother was Myrtle Wright Hurst.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky, Vital Record Indexes, 1911–1999. Database, FamilySearch. George S Hurst, 13 October 1927. Citing Birth, Bell, Kentucky, United States. Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives. Frankfort, KY.&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, he had a keen interest in [[Thomas Edison]]. Hurst grew up on the family farm and came from a large family with two brothers and two sisters. In 2010, he died of a [[brain aneurism]] and was buried at Oak Ridge Memorial Park.&lt;ref&gt;Editor.

==Education==
Hurst attended high school at [[Bell County High School]] in [[Pineville, Kentucky]]. At the age of 15, he enrolled in [[Berea College]]. In 1947, Hurst received a [[B.A.]] degree in physics and a minor in mathematics from Berea College.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Normandi. (Spring 2007). Sam Hurst touches on a Few Great Ideas. Berea College Magazine. Berea College. Berea, KY. 77(4): 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[University of Kentucky]] and graduated in 1948 with the [[M.S.]] degree in physics. During registration at UK, he met Rufus Ritchie. Ritchie became a longtime friend and the two worked on several projects together. After graduation, they both went to ORNL. 
In 1959, Hurst was awarded a [[Ph.D.]] in [[physics]] from the [[University of Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=Hurst1959-1&gt;Hurst, G. S., &amp; Bortner, T. E. (1959).

Negative ions of oxygen. Radiation Research Supplement. 1: 547-557.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oak Ridge National Laboratory==
In 1948, Hurst was recruited by [[Karl Z. Morgan]] and landed a research position at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) in the [[Health Physics]] Division. His starting salary was $325 per month. He made significant contributions in the development of radiation detectors and instrumentation, neutron dosimetry and spectroscopy, and field sample analysis. While working at Oak Ridge, he earned a PhD in physics from the [[University of Tennessee]] in 1959. In 1966, Hurst accepted a position at the [[University of Kentucky]] as Professor of Physics.&lt;ref&gt;Auxier, John A. (July 2010). In Memoriam: George Samuel Hurst, 1927–2010.

===Neutrons, dosimetry and phantoms===
From 1948 to 1950, Hurst worked with Ritchie to develop a fast neutron survey meter and fast neutron dosimetry.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, G. S. (1949). Portable Fast Neutron Survey Meter (No. AECU-613 (ORNL-485)).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, G. (January 1950). MEASUREMENT OF FAST NEUTRON DOSAGE TO TISSUE WITH A PROPORTIONAL COUNTER.

Fast Neutron Count-rate Dosimetry (No. ORNL-589).&lt;/ref&gt; The fast neutron dosimetry work continued throughout the 1950s with the added interest in tissue dose.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, G. S., Ritchie, R. H., &amp; Wilson, H. N. (1951). A Count‐Rate Method of Measuring Fast Neutron Tissue Dose. Review of Scientific Instruments. 22(12): 981-986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, G.

The British journal of radiology. 27(318): 353-357.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the team of Hurst, D.J. Knowles and C. Yochem worked to develop a thermal neutron survey instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, G. S., Knowles, D. J., &amp; Yochem, C. (1952). A thermal neutron survey instrument (No. ORNL-1134). Oak Ridge National Lab.&lt;/ref&gt; Hurst and F.M.

Review of Scientific Instruments. 23(2): 67-72.&lt;/ref&gt; Hurst explored fast neutron dosimetry and [[Computational human phantom|tissue-equivalent phantoms]].&lt;ref&gt;Barr, T. A., &amp; Hurst, G. S. (1954). Fast-neutron dose in a large tissue-equivalent phantom. Nucleonics (US) Ceased publication, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, W. A., &amp; Hurst, G. S. (1954). Fast-neutron dosimetry in a small tissue-equivalent phantom. Nucleonics (US) Ceased publication, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; His team that included J.A. Harter, P.N. Hensley and W.A. Mills studied neutron flux and tissue dose with [[Nuclear fission|fission]] threshold detectors.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, G. S., Harter, J. A., Hensley, P. N., &amp; Mills, W. A. (1954). Neutron Flux and Tissue Dose Studies with Fission Threshold Detectors. Part I. Experimental Measurements. (No. ORNL-1671). Oak Ridge National Lab, Tennessee.&lt;/ref&gt;
Around 1955, Hurst teamed with A.C. Upton, F.P. Conte and W.A. Mills to look at the [[relative biological effectiveness]] (RBE) that involved mixed radiation fields for acute lethality in various animal models.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, A. C., Conte, F. P., Hurst, G. S., &amp; Mills, W. A. (January 1955). The Relative Biological Effectiveness of Fast Neutrons, X-rays, and Gamma-Rays for Acute Lethality in Mice.

The relative biological effectiveness of fast neutrons, X-rays, and γ-rays for acute lethality in mice. Radiation Research. 4(2): 117-131.&lt;/ref&gt;
Additional studies with A.C. Upton, K.W. Christenberry, G.S. Melville, and J. Furth utilized mixed radiation fields to produce [[Cataracts|lens opacity]] in various animal models.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, A. C., Christenberry, K. W., Melville, G. S., Furth, J., &amp; Hurst, G. S. (1956). The Relative Biological Effectiveness of Neutrons, X-Rays, and Gamma Rays for the Production of Lens Opacities: Observations on Mice, Rats, Guinea-Pigs, and Rabbits. Radiology. 67(5): 686-696.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 and again in 1980, Hurst utilized threshold detectors to measure [[Neutron temperature#Neutron energy distribution ranges|neutron spectra]] in order to determine [[Absorbed dose|tissue dose]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, G. S., Harter, J. A., Hensley, P. N., Mills, W. A., Slater, M., &amp; Reinhardt, P. W. (1956). Techniques of measuring neutron spectra with threshold detectors—tissue dose determination. Review of Scientific Instruments. 27(3): 153-156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, G. S., Harter, J. A., Hensley, P. N., Mills, W. A., Slater, M., &amp; Reinhard, P. W. (1980). Techniques of Measuring Neutron Spectra with Threshold Detectors-Tissue Dose Determination. Health Physics. 38(6): 1080-1085.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1961, Hurst led a group that performed measurements of the absorbed dose of neutrons, and of mixed radiation field of neutrons and gamma rays. This resulted in the publication of Handbook 75 for the [[National Bureau of Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, G. S., Caswell, R. S., Maienschein, F. C., Rossi, H. H., Sayeg, J. A., Schuler, R. H., &amp; Wallace, R. W. (1961). Measurement of Absorbed Dose of Neutrons, and of Mixtures of Neutrons and Gamma Rays (No. NBS-HB-75). National Bureau of Standards. Gaithersburg, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alpha survey meter===
In 1950, Hurst and his team developed a portable alpha survey meter.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, W. M., Hurst, G. S., &amp; McDonald, W. B. (1950). A Portable Alpha Survey Meter (No. ORNL-602).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas ionization studies===
In 1953, an interest in the ion pair energy production from 5 MeV [[alpha particles]] led to nearly 2 decades of research, during which time Hurst studied alpha particle ionizations and excitations in various gases and gas mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;Bortner, T. E., &amp; Hurst, G. S. (1953). Energy per ion pair for 5-Mev alpha-particles in helium. Physical Review. 90(1): 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bortner, T. E., &amp; Hurst, G. S. (1954).

===Nevada Test Site===
Hurst and the team of L.J. Deal and H.H. Rossi performed gamma and neutron radiation measurements at the [[Nevada Test Site]] during [[Operation Upshot–Knothole]] for the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Deal, L.

===VUV, vacuum ultraviolet radiation and Jesse effect===
The Jesse effect, named after William P. Jesse, may best be described as the increase in ionization produced in a gas by alpha, beta, or gamma ionizing radiations when a small concentration of a gas with a lower ionization potential is present.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse, W. P. (1970). Isotope Effect as a Function of Alpha‐Particle Energy in the Ionization of Hydrocarbon Gases. The Journal of Chemical Physics. 52(3): 1314-1316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jesse, W. P. (1971).

Photoionization and the Jesse effect: A comparison of yields and isotope effects. Radiation Research. 59(2): 408-421.&lt;/ref&gt; Hurst utilized [[noble gas]]es to examine [[vacuum]] [[ultraviolet radiation]] (VUV) and the Jesse effect. For these efforts, Hurst sought the assistance of Thurmond E. Stewart, James E. Parks, H. Lee Weidner, M. Payne and C. Klots.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, G. S., Stewart, T. E., &amp; Parks, J. E. (1970).

===Time-of-flight investigations===
In the 1960s, Hurst along with L.B. O'Kelly, E.B. Wagner, J.A. Stockdale, James E. Parks, and F.J. Davis investigated [[time-of-flight]] electron transport in gases. The group utilized [[ethylene]], [[water vapor]] and [[hydrogen]] to study and determine time-of-flight electron diffusion coefficients and electron drift velocities for these gases. Hurst led efforts to investigate time-of-flight of electron transport in atomic and molecular gases.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, G. S., O'Kelly, L. B., Wagner, E. B., &amp; Stockdale, J. A. (1963).

===Electron swarm measurement===
In the mid 1960s, Hurst pursued researches that involved electron swarm measurement, swarm‐beam techniques and swarm drift to determine electron capture cross sections in [[heavy water]], [[chlorobenzene]], [[bromobenzene]], [[ethylene]] and ethylene mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, G., &amp; Stockdale, J. (January 1964). Swarm Measurement of Cross Sections for Dissociative Electron Capture in Heavy Water, Chlorobenzene + Bromobenzene. Radiation Research. 22(1): 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stockdale, J.

==Hiroshima and Nagasaki==

In the 1950s, Hurst went to [[Japan]] with colleagues and students Rufus Ritchie, Nello Pace, and Robert E. Smith to conduct studies for the [[Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission]]. The team studied the delayed and latent effects with an emphasis on the [[Mortality rate|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] rates among the [[atomic bomb survivors]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, R.

==Radiation accident expert==
The expertise and experience of Hurst were often called upon for matters that involved radiation accidents.

The IAEA asked for and received assistance from Hurst to investigate the [[Vinča Nuclear Institute|Vinča reactor criticality accident]] that occurred on 15 October 1958 at Vinča, Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, G.

Part of the success of Haiti's HIV healthcare system lies in the governmental commitment to the issue, which alongside the support of donations from the [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|Global Fund]] and [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)]], allows the nation to prioritize the issue.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koenig|first=Serena|last2=Ivers|first2=Lc|last3=Pace|first3=S|last4=Destine|first4=R|last5=Leandre|first5=F|last6=Grandpierre|first6=R|last7=Mukherjee|first7=J|last8=Farmer|first8=Pe|last9=Pape|first9=Jw|date=2010-03-01|title=Successes and challenges of HIV treatment programs in Haiti: aftermath of the earthquake|url=http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/hiv.10.6|journal=HIV Therapy|volume=4|issue=2|pages=145–160|doi=10.2217/hiv.10.6|issn=1758-4310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the extreme poverty afflicting a large Haitian population, the severe economic impact HIV has on the nation, and the controversy surrounding how the virus spread to Haiti and the United States, Haiti is on the path to provide universal treatment, with other developing nations emulating its AIDS treatment system.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== History ==
AIDS in Haitians was first recognized in 34 Haitians living in the United States in 1982, and in the same year eleven individuals in Haiti were suspected to be HIV infected.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Since the majority of these individuals did not fall into the classic risk factor groups, Haitians were classified as a separate risk factor group, causing damage to Haiti's image and economy and affecting tourism. In the same year, the Haitian Study Group on Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections (GHESKIO) was formed to study the new epidemic. GHESKIO used retrospective diagnosis to conclude that from 1979 to 1982, there were 61 cases of AIDS in Haiti. Through various studies and analyses, GHESKIO concluded that the risk factors identified in the 61 individuals were no different to those in other countries, with the primary risk factor being the fact that most of the patients lived in the suburb of Carrefour where prostitution was prevalent. The stigmatization of Haiti, however, continued, and during the presidency of [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]], it was illegal to mention AIDS/HIV in Haiti.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.coha.org/the-sleeping-catastrophe-hivaids-in-an-already-devastated-haiti/|title=The Sleeping Catastrophe: HIV/AIDS in an Already Devastated Haiti.|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1983 to 1987, the virus spread quickly through the population mostly through heterosexual sex, as HIV infected cases attributed to homosexuals or bisexuals went down from 50% to less than 1%.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; In a 1985 to 2000 study, the virus spread twice as fast in developed nations prior to the use of antiretrovirals, as malnutrition, infectious communities, and active tuberculosis were all prevalent in Haiti.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], the first democratically elected President of Haiti, was the first Haitian president to include HIV/AIDS into his platform for his 2001–2004 presidency and initiated governmental policies to ensure the blood supply remains uncontaminated and to prevent and treat the virus amongst the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pnadr360.pdf|title=HIV/AIDS in Haiti: A Literature Review|last=Hempstone|first=Hope|date=2004|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
In Haiti, the three groups where HIV/AIDS is most prevalent are men who have sex with men, sex workers, and prisoners, with prevalence rates of 18.2, 8.4, and 4.3 respectively.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; As opposed to the United States, intravenous drug use in Haiti was more rare and the blood supply was not initially affected by HIV infected individuals. As such, intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs were never major risk factor groups in Haiti since the start of the epidemic.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

As of 2017, UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, reports that HIV in Haiti is most prevalent among adults aged 15 to 49 and is primarily transmitted through [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] contact and mother-to-infant transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/caribbean-hiv-aids-statistics.htm|title=Caribbean HIV &amp; AIDS Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent declines in HIV infection rates are most notable in urban areas, and have been attributed to significant behavioral changes, including decreased number of partners, decreased sexual debut, and increased [[condom]] use. Other explanations for the recent trends include AIDS-related mortality and improvements made in [[blood]] safety early in the epidemic. However, continued political instability, high internal migration rates, high prevalence of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, and weakened health and social services persist as factors with potential negative impacts on the epidemic.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

== Risk factors ==
According to a 2010 study, one major risk factor for HIV infection in Haiti, especially in women, is lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In rural Haitian populations where education levels for women are low and many women are economically dependent on their husbands, a correlation between the stability of the occupation of the husband and HIV prevalence in the wives is observed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women whose husbands are market vendors or mechanics are at a higher risk of HIV infection. On the contrary, the wives of farmers, a more stable occupation, have a 60% lower risk of HIV infection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other indicators of low socioeconomic status, like the use of charcoal for cooking and food insecurity also show correlation with higher HIV infection rates in women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study stipulates that low socioeconomic status and high rates of HIV infection may be connected to the use of transactional sex as an economic survival strategy, a behavior shown in a related South African study to increase HIV infection rates by 1.5 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunkle|first=Kristin L.|last2=Jewkes|first2=Rachel K.|last3=Brown|first3=Heather C.|last4=Gray|first4=Glenda E.|last5=McIntryre|first5=James A.|last6=Harlow|first6=Sioḃán D.|title=Transactional sex among women in Soweto, South Africa: prevalence, risk factors and association with HIV infection|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.02.003|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=59|issue=8|pages=1581–1592|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar trends from related studies have also been seen in other developing nations with gender disparities, such as Malawi, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and Uganda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another vulnerable group is adolescents and young adults. For females, risk factor groups include those who have low levels of education, live away from their parents, have been married, or have had a child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For males, factors indicative of HIV infection are intravenous drug use and sexual debut with an unknown individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For both genders, young adults who are less aware of HIV and its transmission through risky behavior are more likely to be infected, and amongst females, those who talked more openly about HIV infection and testing were less likely to be infected.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, having sexual contact with unfaithful partners, having an STI, especially syphilis, and not using condoms are all additional risk factors that affect both genders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Economic impact ==
On the national level, HIV causes damage to the Haitian economy because the individuals most affected by the epidemic are the young adults that contribute the most to the country's economy.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Georges|first=Yves Marie Dominique|title=HIV/AIDS in Haiti. An Analysis of Demographics, Lifestyle, STD Awareness, HIV Knowledge and Perception that Influence HIV Infection among Haitians.|date=2011|degree=|publisher=Georgia State University|url=https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/iph_theses/172/|doi=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the epidemic, Haiti's tourism and export industries suffered when Haitians were classified as an HIV risk group.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobalist.com/hivaids-in-haiti-and-latin-america/|title=HIV/AIDS in Haiti and Latin America – The Globalist|date=2009-05-02|work=The Globalist|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jean Pape, the head of the largest Haitian HIV research center, Haitian products could no longer be sold in the US and tourism, which was the basis of the Haitian economy, declined drastically.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; With 54% of the Haiti economy based on the service and tourism sector, HIV further weakened Haiti's already struggling economy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

On a household level, HIV causes significant economic strain to the family of infected individuals.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/AIDSimpact/AIDSWebAnnounce.htm|title=The Impact of AIDS|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV infection in a parent can lead to the loss of one source of income which in turn leads to malnutrition, lack of access to education for the children, and increased risk of child labor.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The cost of healthcare is another burden on the family.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; From a 1997 study involving 600 households from Côte d'Ivoire, Burundi, and Haiti, households with at least one HIV infected family member spent nearly twice the amount on healthcare (around 10.6%) compared to families without HIV infected individuals, decreasing household consumption in other areas.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The HIV treatment also on average took up 80% of the entire family's healthcare budget. Even after the death of the HIV infected individual, the household never completely returned to its original level of consumption.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== HIV treatment and prevention ==
Nearly 75% of HIV treatment in Haiti is sponsored and overseen by the NGOs [[Partners In Health]] and Haitian Study Group on Kaposi’s Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections (GHESKIO) in collaboration with the Haitian Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Alongside them, the J[[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|oint United Nations Team on AIDS]] (Joint Team) in Haiti also helps provide the resources to tackle HIV through prevention, treatment, and testing, accelerating the nationwide HIV response.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; As of 2016, around 55% of HIV positive Haitians received antiretroviral therapy.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

=== Elimination of mother to child transmission ===
Prior to the efforts to eliminate vertical transmission of HIV, around 27% of babies born to HIV infected mothers in Haiti contracted the virus from their mothers through breast milk.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; As a preventative measure, GHESKIO and the Ministry of Health set up national guidelines for HIV infected mothers and newborn babies to receive doses of [[zidovudine]]. Since 2003, Haiti has altered its guidelines to allow triple drug ART for pregnant HIV infected women, treatments for existing opportunistic infections, and counseling on the use of formula feed instead of breast milk to lower transmission rates.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Since the use of triple therapy, HIV transmission rates from mother to child for those on triple drug ART has decreased to around 1.9%, while the transmission rates among all pregnant women treated for HIV in any form has dropped to 9.2%, both of which are significant decreases from the initial 27% vertical transmission.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The Joint Team and UNICEF also provides manuals on preventing mother to child transmission of HIV and offers prenatal and postpartum counseling services to HIV infected mothers to stem vertical transmission in Haiti.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; However, further educational efforts are necessary as only around 40% of Haitian HIV infected mothers attend these counseling services, and an even smaller amount get tested for HIV prior to childbirth.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Around 80% of Haitians recognize that the virus can be transmitted vertically, however, the majority of Haitians do not know that treatment of both the mother and child in the weeks before and after childbirth can greatly decrease the risk of infection in the baby.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; This coupled with the fact that around 80% of childbirth in Haiti takes place at home instead of in a hospital necessitates that further connection of HIV infected individuals with the health networks in Haiti is essential to stem vertical transmission.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== HIV Equity Initiative ===
In 1985, [[Paul Farmer]] and his colleagues created a clinic in the Central Plateau of Haiti to serve those displaced by the creation of a hydroelectric dam. The first case of HIV recorded at this clinic was in 1986. In 1987, Farmer spearheaded the effort that lead to the founding of [[Partners In Health|Partners in Health]]. After a 1994 paper detailing the effects of AZT on lowering the rates of transmission from mother to child, the HIV clinic began offering HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy to pregnant mothers, leading to a sharp decline of cases of mother to child transmission.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farmer|first=P.|last2=Léandre|first2=F.|last3=Mukherjee|first3=J. S.|last4=Claude|first4=M.|last5=Nevil|first5=P.|last6=Smith-Fawzi|first6=M. C.|last7=Koenig|first7=S. P.|last8=Castro|first8=A.|last9=Becerra|first9=M. C.|date=2001-08-04|title=Community-based approaches to HIV treatment in resource-poor settings|journal=Lancet|volume=358|issue=9279|pages=404–409|issn=0140-6736|pmid=11502340|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(01)05550-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in 1997, the clinic made [[post-exposure prophylaxis]] (PEP) available to women who suffered from rape and HIV health workers who had occupation injuries. In late 1998, individuals with long term severe opportunistic infections were offered antiretroviral therapy as opposed to only being allowed to treat their symptoms for free. For those infected with the more life-threatening tuberculosis, anti-tuberculous therapy was prioritized over ART.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Partners in Health's success largely comes from the directly observed therapy that is given to the patients, through health care workers known as accompagnateurs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accompagnateurs help the therapy process by making sure the pills are taken on time, answering questions and concerns, and offering moral support to patients and their families.  The clinic also assists the family by offering social services such as payment of tuition and highly attended meetings for patients to stay involved in the treatment process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The success of the program in Haiti served as a model to other developing nations that, despite high unemployment, low GDP per capita, and high HIV prevalence, a nation can have a successful HIV treatment program, regardless of urbanization and wealth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== HIV prevention ===
HIV prevention has been brought about, especially in the younger generation, through education and the spreading of awareness of safe sex practices and condom use.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The Joint Team, in 2016, has collaborated with the Ministry of Education to create health clubs and programs in 100 schools as well as trained 566 educators, supplied over a million condoms, hosted more than 7000 HIV tests, and referred more than 80% of infected individuals from those tests to seek treatment.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; UNICEF also sponsored efforts to create a video series and a Facebook page targeted towards the 15–35 age group to spread awareness about the risks of HIV and measures to prevent transmission.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

=== Challenges ===
After the devastation caused by the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 Haitian Earthquake]], Haiti's HIV treatment system was affected greatly. Estimates by the Haitian government indicate that around 40% of the initial 24,000 Haitians lost access to antiretrovirals after the earthquake.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pulitzercenter.org/projects/caribbean/after-quake-hivaids-haiti|title=After the Quake: HIV/AIDS in Haiti|date=2010-08-19|work=Pulitzer Center|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV positive individuals displaced due to the earthquake often live in substandard conditions in tent cities, decreasing their immunity and increasing their susceptibility to infection or progressing to AIDS. The large concentration of HIV positive individuals in confined tent cities also increases the risk of HIV transmission within the smaller community of individuals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, the overall structure of the HIV treatment system has largely remained intact and the majority of HIV infected patients continue to receive access to  antiviral therapy while the nation rebuilds the rest of its healthcare system.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Other challenges to the HIV treatment and prevention efforts in Haiti include more recent events, such as [[Hurricane Matthew]], the [[2010 Haiti cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak]], and additional refugees arriving from the [[Dominican Republic]], the limitations on the human and financial resources the NGOs can provide, and the fluctuating level of cooperation from the Haitian government.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

== The Haitian connection controversy ==
The Haitian connection controversy refers to the debate regarding the origins of the HIV virus in Haiti and the United States and whether or not HIV was spread into the US by Haitians or into Haiti by Americans. The controversy began in the 1982, when the CDC noted that 34 cases of immunodeficient patients were Haitian.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; This "connection" noted by physicians caused the erroneous labeling of Haitians as a risk factor group for HIV, leading to the rise of the term "the 4-H's" referring to Homosexuals, Hemophiliacs, Heroin addicts, and Haitians as the major groups prone to HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/history-hiv-aids/origin|title=Origin of HIV &amp; AIDS|date=2015-07-20|work=AVERT|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Jacques Pépin, a [[Quebec]]er author of ''The Origins of AIDS'', stipulated that Haiti was one of HIV's entry points to the United States. In July 1960, when [[Belgian Congo]] gained independence, the United Nations recruited Francophone experts and technicians from all over the world to assist in filling administrative gaps left by [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; By 1962, Haitians made up the second largest group of well-educated experts in the country totaling around 4500. One of them may have carried HIV back across the Atlantic in the 1960s. Pépin argues that its spread in Haiti was sped by poor Haitians in need of money selling their blood plasma at centers such as Hemo-Caribbean, which was known to have poor hygienic practices.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Plasma centers separated plasma from blood cells and failed to change needles and tubing between patients, a practice that rapidly spreads blood-borne diseases. [[Luckner Cambronne]], co-owner of Hemo-Caribbean and known as the "Vampire of the Caribbean", was notorious for selling Haitian blood and cadavers abroad for medical uses. Plasma from Hemo-Caribbean was exported to the United States at a maximum rate of 5,000 to 6,000 [[litre]]s per month in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTaMBrPBK6EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Origin of Aids |editor=Pépin, Jacques |page=188; 201 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1990 book "AIDS and Accusation," [[Paul Farmer]] refutes the idea that Haiti was an HIV entry point to the USA. Referencing an epidemiological study on the prevalence of sarcomas associated with HIV/AIDS contraction, Farmer suggests that Cambronne's plasma business occurred before identifiers of HIV infection were recorded in Haiti, indicating that the disease did not arrive in Haiti until at least the late-1970s.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Farmer instead argues that HIV/AIDS in Haiti was introduced by visitors from the US.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62738653|title=AIDS and accusation : Haiti and the geography of blame|last=1959–|first=Farmer, Paul,|date=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520248397|edition=Updated with a new preface|location=Berkeley|oclc=62738653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 study, 5 HIV isolates from different regions were compared on the molecular level. By comparing the number of mutations present in different strands of HIV found from patients from Central Africa, the United States, and Haiti, the results predict that the Haitian strain of the virus is the genetic midpoint between the strains found in Central Africa and the United States, and that the virus traveled from Haiti to the United States about 3 years after it reached Haiti.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; However, this study is refuted by Jean Pape as a continuation of decades old prejudice against Haiti in regards to the AIDS epidemic, as the study does not provide conclusive evidence that the virus traveled from Haiti to the US.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jon|date=2007-11-02|title=Reconstructing the Origins of the AIDS Epidemic From Archived HIV Isolates|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/318/5851/731.1|journal=Science|language=en|volume=318|issue=5851|pages=731–731|doi=10.1126/science.318.5851.731a|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17975041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of origin, the consequences of HIV/AIDS in Haiti were severe. The disease spread rapidly throughout Haiti, infecting thousands.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Haiti's burgeoning tourist industry suffered greatly from the association with HIV/AIDS, and Haitians living in the USA were placed on the banned list for blood donations, alongside homosexuals and intravenous drug users, until 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/24/science/fda-set-to-reverse-blood-ban.html|title=F.D.A.

==Healthcare==
Expenditure on health was 8.7% of GDP in 2014.  Only 2.9% of the population is covered by private health insurance.

The [[Honduran Social Security Institute]] which runs the national public health system was established in 1959. People generally had to travel to [[Tegucigalpa]] to access services. In the 1970s a medical center in [[San Pedro Sula]] was opened. Services were not available until 1992 in [[El Progreso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Honduras: A Country Study |url=http://countrystudies.us/honduras/59.htm |accessdate=19 November 2018 |publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress, |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ministry of Health in Honduras provides care to almost 90% of the population, but there is still little provision for the rural population, and there is a serious shortage of doctors.  The ratio of doctor to population in 1984 was one to 1,510.  In 2015, there were 10,995 registered doctors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9202">{{for|or other kinds of stress|Stress (disambiguation){{!}}Stress}}
'''Incident stress''' is a condition caused by acute stress which overwhelms a staff person trained to deal with critical incidents such as within the line of duty for [[first responder]]s, [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s, and other similar personnel. If not recognized and treated at onset, incident stress can lead to more serious effects of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].

==Signs and symptoms==
* Confusion
* Lower [[attention span]]
* Poor concentration
* Denial
* Guilt
* [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]
* [[Anger]]
* Change in interactions with others
* Increased or decreased eating
* Uncharacteristic, excessive humor or silence
* Unusual behavior

==Symptomatology==
Symptomatology associated with excessive acute or sustained stress may include cognitive impairments such as diminished memory, decision-making capacity, and attention span; emotional reactions such as anger, [[irritability]], guilt, fear, [[paranoia]], and depression; and physical problems ranging from fatigue, dizziness, [[migraine]] headaches, and [[high blood pressure]] to [[diabetes]] and [[cancer]]. Self-destructive and [[antisocial behavior]] may also be triggered.&lt;ref name="Spitzer" /&gt; Symptoms can vary depending on several factors, such as trauma severity, the amount of social support, and additional life stresses.&lt;ref name="De Boer" /&gt;

==Causes==
A critical incident that occurs to an individual is the starting point for incident stress if the individual is unable to cope. Critical incidents are defined as sudden, unexpected events that have an emotional impact sufficient to overwhelm the usually effective [[coping skill]]s of an individual and cause significant [[psychological trauma|psychological damage]].&lt;ref name="De Boer" /&gt;

Healthy [[attachment theory|attachment]] among adults is key to managing critical incident stress. Adults have four [[wikt:attachment|attachment]] styles: 1) fearful avoidant, 2) anxious-preoccupied, 3) dismissive avoidant, and 4) secure. ''Fearful avoidant'' adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, because they want emotional connections but are very reluctant to allow them. ''Anxious-preoccupied'' adults tend to deal with their stress by distancing themselves from the reality of the situation to avoid the emotional burden. They also tend to see themselves negatively and doubt their worth in relationships frequently. ''Dismissive avoidant'' adults view themselves as self-sufficient, and in no need of emotional connectedness. ''Secure'' adults have positive views about themselves, and feel comfortable with independence and intimacy. Secure adults typically cope better with critical incident stress, as opposed to non-secure adults, because they develop less stress by nature. Secure adults are also less likely to develop post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;ref name="Bogaerts" /&gt;

People exhibiting signs of incident stress require professional help to avoid the more serious condition of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="First Aid" /&gt; The [[DSM IV-TR]] describes posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as having three distinct symptom clusters: 1) re-experiencing the event, 2) avoidance of stimuli associated with the event and numbing of general responsiveness, and 3) increased arousal. The first symptom cluster, ''re-experiencing the event'', is a mixture of physical and psychological reactions someone goes through after the critical event has occurred. Those includes [[nightmare]]s, reoccurring thoughts/[[flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s, or [[panic attack]]s. The second symptom cluster, ''avoidance of stimuli associated with the event and numbing of general responsiveness'', occurs when someone avoids anything that could possibly trigger memories of the critical event. This includes thoughts and feelings associated with the event, and even physical stimuli such as people and places having to do with the event. The third symptom cluster, ''increased arousal'', produces anxiety-driven responses, such as trouble sleeping, excessive anger and irritability, [[hypervigilance]], poor concentration, and exaggerated [[startle response]]. When these symptoms persist for more than 2 weeks, a diagnosis of [[acute stress disorder]] may be appropriate.&lt;ref name="Bogaerts" /&gt; Factors, such as family psychiatric history, or childhood abuse may mediate the relationship between critical incidents and PTSD.&lt;ref name="De Boer" /&gt;

==Management==

Critical incident-stress debriefings (CISDs) have proven to be a successful coping method over the past 15 years for individuals in high-stress, [[emergency response]] professions.&lt;ref name="Van Patten" /&gt; Nearly 300 CISD teams exist in the United States, offering intervention to fire, paramedic, police, and other emergency personnel. These debriefings are designed to offer emotional reassurance, time for ventilation of feelings, education about stress management, and consultation.&lt;ref name="Spitzer" /&gt; This technique was first implemented by Jeff Mitchell, of the International Critical Incident Stress Foundation, in 1983 to treat emergency care workers in the [[mental health profession]]. These debriefings were created to prevent worsening of the stress and also promote recovery. Judith Herman, author of ''Trauma &amp; Recovery'', identified three critical conditions that must be satisfied in order to progress toward recovery: 1) safety, 2) remembrance and mourning, and 3) reconnection. ''Safety'' is achieved when victims learn to feel relaxed and trust in the recovery process by recognizing there are disturbed emotions. "Remembrance and mourning" of the critical incident is necessary in order for the victim to move toward recovery. "Reconnection" occurs when the victim feels they are emotionally stable enough to pursue [[stress management]] and recovery.&lt;ref name="Rich" /&gt;

Problem-solving appraisals were tested as another possible method for coping with critical incident stress. The first successful testing of this technique was done by Sarah Baker and Karen Williams in the United Kingdom, using a testing group of stressed firefighters. These firefighters filled out anonymous self-report questionnaires that gauged their level of stress. The research results supported the hypothesis that problem-solving appraisals serve a moderating function between [[work stress]] and psychological distress.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;

'''Inflammatory papillary hyperplasia''' is a [[hyperplasia]] (overgrowth) of [[soft tissue]], usually beneath a denture. It is associated with poor denture hygiene, denture overuse, and ill-fitting dentures.

It is a closely related condition to [[inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia]] (epulis fissuratum), but the appearance and location differs.&lt;ref name=Barnes2009 /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
It appears as an asymptomatic [[erythema]]tous area, usually on the hard palate, with a pebbly surface.

==Cause==
The exact cause of inflammatory papillary hyperplasia is unknown, but it is thought to be a reactive, inflammatory lesion in response to irritation from an upper dental prosthesis. Nonetheless, it may also occur on the hard palates of patients who are chronic mouth-breathers.  Sometimes, this disease can be found in conjunction with another denture-related disease, an [[epulis fissuratum]].

The appearance of an epulis fissuratum [[microscope|microscopically]] is an overgrowth of stratified squamous [[epithelium]] [[cell (biology)|cells]].  Depending on the how advanced the condition is, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia may be present.

In mild cases, treatment consists of removal of the denture with spontaneous regression of the disease.  In advanced cases of inflammatory papillary hyperplasia, [[surgery]] may be needed, along with behavioral modification toward proper denture use.
==Diagnosis==
Clinical presentation and patient history of denture use.
==Treatment==
Antifungals to reduce erythema, do nothing (usually lasts 24 hours), Surgical removal (not recommended).

==Epidemiology==
Due to the strong association with denture-wearing, the lesion tends to occur more in adults than children. There is no gender predilection.&lt;ref name=Rajendran2014 /&gt; In people who wear dentures 24 hours a day, its incidence is around 20%.

The '''Iranian Red Crescent Society''' (IRCS), officially the '''Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran''' ({{lang-fa|جمعیت هلال‌احمر جمهوری اسلامی ایران|Jamʿiyat-e Helāl-e Aḥmar-e Jomhuri-e eslāmi-e Irān}}) is a [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] [[Aid agency|humanitarian organization]] in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=JAMʿIYAT-E HELĀL-E AḤMAR-E IRĀN|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|date=21 January 2016|publisher=Bibliotheca Persica Press|location=New York City|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/jamiyat-e-helal-e-ahmar|last1=Ghassemlou|first1=Farid|edition=Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded as the [[Red Lion and Sun Society]] in 1922,&lt;ref name="IRRC"/&gt; it became affiliated with the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) in 1924&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=IRCS among top five int’l relief bodies|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/News/58883.html|work=Iran daily|date=4 January 2015|access-date=24 November 2017|id=58883}}&lt;/ref&gt; and changed its name and emblem in 1980, informing the international community of ''[[Hilal Ahmar]]'' adoption&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-review-of-the-red-cross/article/interview-with-ahmad-ali-noorbala/09501DF095845B333E7ADDCC80B7C451|title=Adoption of the red crescent by the Islamic Republic of Iran|journal=International Review of the Red Cross|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|volume=20|number=219|date=December 1980|pages=316–317|authors=H.

The society is one of the world's largest national societies within IFRC&lt;ref name="IRRC"/&gt; and is noted for its special expertise in responding to [[earthquakes]].&lt;ref name="BJMES"/&gt;

Since inception, the IRCS has participated in a variety of public activities. Its core activity is to perform relief and rescue operations to help victims and the injured in natural disasters and accidents. It also engages a in wide range of humanitarian services in health and rehabilitation, training and research.&lt;ref name="IRRC"/&gt; The society had a therapeutic approach and was regarded a major [[healthcare]] institution with thousands of hospital beds across the country until 1979, when all of its medical facilities were transferred to the [[Ministry of Health and Medical Education|Ministry of Health]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

IRCS is an example of strong national societies that play an important role domestically&lt;ref name="BJMES"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Islamic Societies, with Special Reference to Jordan|journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|volume=24|number=2|year=1997|pages=157–177|publisher=British Society for Middle Eastern Studies|author=Jonathan Benthall {{subscription}}|jstor=195770|doi=10.1080/13530199708705644}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is held in high esteem by the Iranian general public.&lt;ref name="IRRC"/&gt;

==Organization==
[[File:Red Lion and Sun Society of Iran.gif|thumb|Emblem formerly used for the [[Red Lion and Sun Society]]]]
IRCS has 30 governorate headquarters, one in each [[province of Iran]], and 330 branches throughout the country, as of 2005.&lt;ref name="IRRC"/&gt; Based on the latest structure, it is made up of four departments: relief and rescue (''emdād wa najāt''), medical provisions (''tadārokāt-e pezeški''), volunteers (''dāvṭalabān''), and youth (''javānān'').&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; The latter is largely made up by high school and university student members.&lt;ref name="IRRC"/&gt;

According to the law enacted by the [[Iranian Parliament]], the society is run by a chairman appointed by the [[President of Iran]]. This procedure is in contrast with the elective nature of a society chairman as suggested by the IFRC.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; The secretary general is responsible for the administrative and executive affairs.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

'''Sr. Dr. Maura Lynch''' (September 10, 1938 – December 9, 2017) was an Irish doctor, a nun, and proponent of women's health.

==Early life and education==
Lynch was born in [[Youghal]], County Cork, Ireland to Patrick and Jane Lynch on September 10, 1938. She was one of nine children, three girls and six boys. Her father worked for the Post Office and moved the family with him around the country. Her mother was a teacher. The family spoke Irish at home. Lynch entered the convent of the [[Medical Missionaries of Mary]] (MMM) just before her 18th birthday in [[Clonmel]], Co. Tipperary in 1956. She completed her education in the medical school at [[University College, Dublin]] to become a doctor. Lynch graduated in the top three of her class. She went on to get a Diploma in Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] in London in 1966. Once her training was complete she was sent to Angola in 1967 after a period in Lisbon, Portugal, to learn Portuguese. She studied in the Lisbon School of Tropical Medicine where she gained her Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Public Health.&lt;ref name="IT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Irish nun who survived aerial bombings to become leading doctor in women’s health |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/irish-nun-who-survived-aerial-bombings-to-become-leading-doctor-in-women-s-health-1.3334104 |work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCD"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sr Dr Maura Lynch |url=http://www.ucd.ie/medicine/ourcommunity/ouralumni/alumniprofilesinterviews/srdrmauralynch/ |website=UCD School of Medicine &amp; Medical Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Remembering a life of service: Sister Maura Lynch, MMM – Fistula Care Plus |url=https://fistulacare.org/blog/2018/01/remembering-sister-maura-lynch/ |website=fistulacare.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news |title=Death of Sister Maura Lynch - Independent.ie |url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/droghedaindependent/localnotes/death-of-sister-maura-lynch-36418926.html |work=Independent.ie |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IT2"&gt;{{cite news |title=The female trailblazers of Irish medicine |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/the-female-trailblazers-of-irish-medicine-1.3405003 |work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RSCI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Obstetrics Archives - RCSI women |url=https://digitalheritagecollections.rcsi.ie/rcsiwomen/tag/obstetrics/ |website=RCSI women}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyall |first1=Joanna |title=Maura Lynch: fistula fighter and nun |journal=BMJ |date=23 March 2018 |volume=360 |pages=k1379 |doi=10.1136/bmj.k1379 |url=https://www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.k1379 |language=en |issn=0959-8138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Breslin |first1=Sister Carol |title=Lynch, Sr. Maura - Medical Missionaries of Mary |url=http://mmmworldwide.org/index.php/obituaries/1311-lynch-sr-maura |website=mmmworldwide.org |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Chiulo,_Angola.jpg|thumb|The hospital at Chiolo/TChiolo]]
In [[Angola]], then known as Portuguese West Africa, Lynch worked as the medical director of the hospital at Chiulo. Lynch remained in the country during the [[Angolan War of Independence]] and the 1975 [[Angolan Civil War]]. The hospital became a focal point for war wounded.&lt;ref name="IT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UCD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IT2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RSCI"/&gt;

Lynch completed her fellowship in surgery in 1985 and was then sent to Kitovu, [[Uganda]] in 1987 via Anua, [[Nigeria]]. In Nigeria Lynch learned about the repair of obstetrical [[fistulae]] which became a major focus of her work. She set up a medical centre in [[Kitovu Hospital]] for women affected by fistula and trained medical personnel on how to prevent and treat fistulae. The programme created by Lynch has received international recognition and awards. She was a founding member of the Association of Surgeons in Uganda. The government of Uganda granted her a Certificate of Residency for life.&lt;ref name="IT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UCD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IT2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RSCI"/&gt; UCD awarded her an Honorary Fellowship of the School of Medicine in 2007.&lt;ref name="IT"/&gt; In 2013 she was given an honorary Fellowship in Obstetrics and Gynaecology from London College of Obstetric &amp; Gynaecology and In 2015 she was awarded the Council of Europe's [[North-South Prize]].&lt;ref name="UCD"/&gt;

A fall in her eightieth year ended Lynch's tenure in Kitovu. She had surgery and moved to another local convent to recover. However less than a month later on the planned date of her [[golden jubilee]] celebration of her life in Africa, December 9, she died in [[Kampala]] Hospital and was buried in [[Masaka]], Uganda. She is remembered as a mentor, a feminist, and an advocator for women's rights. She is commemorated on the ''Women on Walls'' at Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.&lt;ref name="IT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UCD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LYNCH, Sr. Maura : Death notice - Irish Times Family Notices |url=http://notices.irishtimes.com/death/lynch-sr-maura/52253938 |website=notices.irishtimes.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RSCI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blazing a Trail exhibition celebrates Irish diaspora women {{!}} EPIC Museum |url=https://epicchq.com/blazing-a-trail-exhibition-irish-diaspora-women/ |work=EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum in Dublin|date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3948">The '''patient experience''' describes an individual's experience of illness/injury and how [[healthcare]] treats them. Increasing focus on patient experience is part of a move towards [[patient-centered care]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed F, Burt J, Rowland M: Measuring patient experience: concepts and methods. In The Patient - Patient-Centered Outcomes Research. doi:10.1007/s40271-014-0060-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mirzaei, M., Aspin, C., Essue, B., Jeon, Y. H., Dugdale, P., Usherwood, T., &amp; Leeder, S. (2013). A patient-centred approach to health service delivery: improving health outcomes for people with chronic illness. BMC health services research, 13(1), 251.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often operationalised through metrics, a trend related to [[consumerism]] and [[New Managerialism]].

Patient experience (PX) is defined as the sum of all interactions, shaped by an organization’s culture, that influence patient perceptions across the continuum of care&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theberylinstitute.org/?page=DefiningPatientExp|title=Defining Patient Experience|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Patient experience has become a key [[Quality (business)|Quality]] outcome for healthcare; measuring it is seen to support improvement in [[healthcare quality]], governance, public accountability and, especially in the [[English NHS]], [[patient choice]].&lt;ref name="benson14"&gt;[http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/14/499 Benson T, Potts HWW (2014)]. A short generic patient experience measure: howRwe development and validation. BMC Health Services Research, 14, 499. doi:10.1186/s12913-014-0499-z&lt;/ref&gt; Measures of patient experience arose from work in the 1980s and is now there use is now widescale. However, their effectiveness has been questioned&lt;ref&gt;Haugum M, Danielsen K, Iversen HH, Bjertnaes O: The use of data from national and other large-scale user experience surveys in local quality work: a systematic review.International J Qual Health Care 2014:1;14. doi:10.1093/intqhc/mzu077&lt;/ref&gt; and clinicians and managers may disagree about their use.&lt;ref&gt;Rozenblum R, Lisby M, Hockey P, Levtzion-Korach O, Salzberg C, Efrati N, Lipsitz S, Bates D: The patient satisfaction chasm: the gap between hospital management and frontline clinicians. BMJ Qual Saf 2013, 22:242-250&lt;/ref&gt;

When patient experience is discussed in terms of experiences with health care services it is similar to [[patient satisfaction]]. However, patient experience is often reported in health research as also encompassing people's experiences of illness and injury outside of their experiences with health services, such as those experiences with family and friends, and the influence of illness/injury over their capacity to engage in social activities or previously imagined futures&lt;ref&gt;Bury, M. (1982). Chronic illness as biographical disruption. Sociology of health &amp; illness, 4(2), 167-182.&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, researchers might report of the patient experience of living with heart failure&lt;ref&gt;Jeon, Y. H., Kraus, S. G., Jowsey, T., &amp; Glasgow, N. J. (2010). The experience of living with chronic heart failure: a narrative review of qualitative studies. BMC health services research, 10(1), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; or other chronic illnesses&lt;ref&gt;Jeon, Y.

A '''psychiatric history''' is the result of a medical process where a clinician working in the field of [[mental health]] (usually a [[psychiatrist]]) systematically records the content of an interview with a patient. This is then combined with the [[mental status examination]] to produce a "[[psychiatric formulation]]" of the person being examined.

[[Psychologist]]s take a similar history, often referred to as a '''psychological history'''.

This article mainly covers the initial assessment history taking of a patient presenting for the first time with a new complaint.

==Background==
In the field of [[medicine]] a patient history is an account of the significant events in the patient's life that have a relevance to the issue being addressed. The clinician taking the history guides the process in an attempt to achieve a succinct summary of these relevant details. Much of the history is obtained by asking questions. Some of these questions are quite specific, such as, "How old are you?" and others are more open, such as, "How have you been feeling lately?" Although the structure of the interview may appear disjointed, the end result is usually under a set of headings which have a worldwide similarity.

==Patient identification==
The basic details of who the patient is are collected.&lt;ref name="urlUIC, Dept. of Psychiatry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psych.uic.edu/psyclerk/psychiatric.htm |title=UIC, Dept. of Psychiatry |work= |accessdate=2009-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919142147/http://www.psych.uic.edu/psyclerk/psychiatric.htm |archivedate=2009-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes their age, sex, educational status, religion, occupation, relationship status, address and contact details. This serves several purposes. Firstly, it is necessary information for administrative purposes and for this reason some of this is often taken by clerks. Secondly, the questions are largely non threatening and provide a gentle introduction into the meeting of patient and clinician. Thirdly, it provides a format for individual introduction suitable to the culture. Thus the clinician may start by introducing themselves and then move on to these questions. This initial structure can provide a sense of familiarity for the patient who is stressed about what is happening.

==Source and method of presentation==
The next step is to determine why the patient is there. How did they get to be in the interview? Were they referred by someone (such as another clinician, a relative or friend, or by the police or the courts) or did they come looking for help? If they were referred by someone then what was that person's reason for the referral. Often such information is provided in a referral letter or by an earlier phone call.

==The main (chief) complaints==
The clinician next tries to clarify what are the main problems that have brought the patient to be there. Some of this may have already been achieved in the previous section. The patient may have more than one problem and these may be related, such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] and [[alcohol abuse]] or seemingly unrelated, such as [[panic disorder]] and [[premature ejaculation]]. The patient is unlikely to present a [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and is more likely to describe the nature of their problems in common language.

==History of the presenting complaints (present illness)==
The clinician then attempts to obtain a clear description of these problems. When did they start? How did they start, suddenly, slowly or in fits and starts? Have they fluctuated over time? What does the patient describe as the essential features of the complaints? Having developed a [[hypothesis]] of what may be the diagnosis, the clinician next looks at symptoms that might confirm this hypothesis or lead them to consider another possibility. Much of the mental process for the clinician is involved in this process of hypothesis testing to arrive at a diagnostic formulation that will form the basis of a management plan. The severity of each complaint is assessed and this may include probing questions on sensitive issues such as [[suicide|suicidal thoughts]] or sexual difficulties.

==Past history==
This is divided into the ''psychiatric past history'', which looks at any previous episodes of the presenting complaint as well as any other past or ongoing psychiatric problems. The ''past substance (drug) history'' included data about patterns of use (mode of administration, age of onset, frequency, amount, last use, medical or psychological complications, history of attempting to quit) for alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. The ''medical past history'' documents significant illnesses, both past and current, and significant medical events such as [[head injury]], [[seizures]], major surgeries, and major illnesses. A separate ''sexual history'' gathers data about sexual orientation and sexual activity. Finally a ''history of abuse'', including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse is obtained from the patient and collateral sources (family members or close family friends) as trauma might not be directly remembered by the patient.

==Family history==
Many [[mental illness|psychiatric disorders]] have a [[genetics|genetic]] component and the biological family history is thus relevant. Clinical experience also suggests that a response to treatment may have a genetic component as well. Thus a patient who presents with [[clinical depression]] whose mother also suffered from the same disorder and responded well to [[fluoxetine]] would indicate that this drug would be more likely to help in the patient's disorder.

Apart from the genetic factors, research has shown that illnesses in the parents such as depression and [[alcohol abuse]] are associated with a higher rate of some conditions in the children growing up in that environment. Similar effects are seen with the death of a parent from a protracted illness.

==Developmental history==
This documents the significant events in the patient's life. Ideally it starts with pre-natal factors such as maternal illnesses or complications with the [[pregnancy]], then documents delivery and early childhood illnesses or problems. It then looks at significant events in the patient's life such as parental separation, [[abuse]], [[education]], psychosexual development, peer relationships, behavioural aspects and any legal complications. It flows then into adulthood with relationship and occupational histories. The aim is to get an overview of who the patient is and what they have experienced in life, both good and bad. Major stresses and transitions such as marriage, parenthood, retirement, death or loss of a partner, and financial success and failure are all important, as is how the patient has dealt with them. Sexual adjustment and problems can be relevant and are often questioned.

==Social history==
If the information has not already been obtained, the clinician then documents the social circumstances of the patient looking at factors such as finances, housing, relationships, drug and alcohol use, and problems with the law or other authorities. This is also a time to document racial or cultural issues that are relevant to the presenting complaint.

==Review of Systems==
A psychiatric review of systems &lt;ref name="urlAm Fam Physician. 1998 Nov 1;58(7):1617-1624."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/1998/1101/p1617.html |title=Am Fam Physician 1998 Nov 1;58(7):1617-1624. |work= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; may include screening questions directed at identifying or exploring co-[[Disease#Morbidity|morbid]] psychiatric illnesses or issues (e.g. SIGECAPS mnemonic or [[PHQ-9]] for depression, [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7]] for anxiety, DIGFAST mnemonic for mania, or specific questioning around psychoses or other psychiatric complaints.  A full review of systems should attempt to identify and list all of the relevant STRESSORS that may be impacting a patient's function and overall health.

==Summary==
Having collected this information the clinician usually then considers any other factors that might be relevant to the particular patient and enquires about them. Although the gathering of the information may follow the flow of the patient's thoughts rather than those of the clinician, it is not uncommon for the clinician to record the psychiatric history under headings, such as those above, to make it easier for others who will later read it.

Subsequent history taking on reviews concentrates on changes in the levels of symptoms and responses to treatment, including possible [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]].

The '''Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965''', was an Act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], which amended the existing legislation controlling the registration system of births, deaths and marriages in [[Scotland]] founded in 1855. The Act set out the roles, responsibilities and functions of the [[Registrar General for Scotland]], and the ability of the Registrar-General to appoint other Registrars. The Act also provides for a yearly report to be published by the Registrar-General delineating annual trends in Scotland's population - including estimated population size, birth rates, death rates and migration rates to be presented to [[Scottish Ministers]].

The Act has been substantially amended in many areas with succeeding legislation, such as the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], the [[Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977]], the [[Adoption (Scotland) Act 1978]], the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] and the [[Scotland Act 1998]]. The Scotland Act transferred overall control of the [[Registrar General for Scotland]] and the [[General Register Office for Scotland]] from the [[Scottish Office]] to the [[Scottish Executive]]- the devolved government of [[Scotland]]. However many of the central functions of the [[General Register Office for Scotland]] continue to be governed by the Act.

'''Seč dam''' ([[Czech language|Czech]] Sečská přehrada) is an artificial [[drinking water]] reservoir located in [[Pardubice Region]], [[Czech Republic]]. It supplies cities of [[Pardubice]] and [[Chrudim]] and is also an important tourist destination located in protected area [[Železné hory]]. The dam has also regulatory function and its water is used in some water [[power plant]]s.

==Location==
Seč [[dam]] is the largest dam in the protected landscape area [[Železné hory]]. It is located on river [[Chrudimka]] in a [[valley]] close to the [[Seč (town)|town of the same name]], about 20&amp;nbsp;kilometers from Chrudim and 25&amp;nbsp;kilometers from Pardubice. The lake is approx. 7&amp;nbsp;kilometers long and is situated at 490&amp;nbsp;meters above the sea level.

==History==
The dam was constructed between 1925 and 1934 as a protection against [[floods]]. As a result of the construction, 22 buildings were depopulated and flooded. Remains of some of them are popular destination for [[scuba diving|scuba divers]]. A small power plant was constructed between 1941 and 1946. In 1947 another smaller reservoir was constructed approx 1&amp;nbsp;km from the main lake and it is called '''Seč II'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sečská údolní nádrž|url=http://www.mestosec.cz/informacni-centrum/historie-mesta-sece/secska-prehrada|website=Město Seč|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosystem==
The environmentally most valuable part of Seč are Ostrůvek and the Oheb peninsula, which consists of a steep rock that ends with a small rocky promontory covered with pines. This place is a home to some rare [[invertebrate]] species ([[snail]]s, [[beetles]]) as well as a natural habitat of [[Eurasian eagle-owl]]s. The forest that covers the Oheb rock consists of some very old species of [[European beech]]es. Dead trees are left to decay and become hosts for a wide range of [[polypore]]s that feed on their dead wood.

==Tourism==
The lake and its surroundings are the main tourist attraction of the Železné hory region. The surroundings are hilly and covered with [[forest]]s, [[meadow]]s and [[Field (agriculture)|field]]s. The lake offers great variety of activities including [[Human swimming|swimming]], [[sailing]], [[boating]], [[windsurfing]], [[scuba diving]], [[fishing]] in summer and [[ice skating]] in winter (at own risk). The forests around the lake offer great opportunity for [[hiking]], [[horse riding]] or [[cross-country skiing]] in winter. The most important places on Seč and its vicinity are:
*'''Oheb''': Romantic [[ruins]] of a [[castle]] from the 13th or 14th century. The remains of the castle's largest [[tower]] are clearly visible from the lake and make one of the most distinctive sceneries of Železné hory.
*'''Vildštejn''': Another ruin of a small castle now located above a road [[tunnel]] next to the dam. Unlike Oheb, Vildštejn is not accessible.
*'''Ostrůvek''' (little island): Small area below Oheb surrounded by water and covered with trees. It used to be a [[nudist]] beach.
*'''Ústupky''': Most of the hotels, restaurants and other recreational facilities are located here.
*'''Jewish cemetery''': Opposite to Ústupky, several well-preserved Jewish tombstones are located close to the bank of the lake.
*'''Wooden plumbing''': Constructed in the 1940s. Outstanding technical sight. Almost 1300m long wooden plumbing that used to supply the power plant with water from the lake.

==Ecology==
Oheb and Ostrůvek are protected natural areas threatened by tourists that visit these sites. Another ecological issue is the [[wastewater]] from surrounding villages and recreational objects that contaminates the lake. It does not represent a direct risk to the people who swim in the water but it causes [[algal bloom]]. In some cases, large areas of green "tufts" can be observed. This was originally believed to be caused by [[manure]] washed down from the fields close to the lake, but results of recent researches proved that [[fluoride]] compounds from manure are insoluble in water so it cannot be the primary cause. The algal bloom season on Seč may start as soon as in June and gets worse when there's lack of [[rain]] which reduces the water flow. It is recommended to have a shower after swimming in the water or avoid entering the water when the situations worsens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinice ze Sečské přehrady jen tak nezmizí, podle radního Kroutila by pomohla kanalizace v okolních obcích|url=http://chrudimskenoviny.cz/kategorie/od-sousedu/sinice-ze-secske-prehrady-jen-tak-nezmizi-podle-radniho-kroutila-pomohla-kanali|website=Chrudimské noviny|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''special needs plan''' (or SNP, often pronounced "snip") is a category of the US [[Medicare Advantage]] plan designed to attract and enroll Medicare beneficiaries who fall into a certain special needs demographic.  There are two types of SNPs.  The exclusive SNP enrolls only those beneficiaries who fall into the special needs demographic.  The other type is the disproportionate share SNP.  "Disproportionate share" SNPs enroll a greater percentage of the target special needs population as compared to a national percentage of the target population. Under the federal �[[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] of 2003, Congress identified special needs individuals" as (1) institutionalized, or (2) [[Medicare dual eligible|dually eligible]], or (3) individuals with severe or disabling chronic conditions. More specifically, special needs individuals include:

*'''Institutionalized beneficiaries''', defined as those who reside or are expected to reside for 90 days or longer in a long term care facility (defined as either: skilled nursing facility (SNF)/NF, ICF or inpatient psychiatric facility), or those living in the community but requiring an equivalent level of care to those residing in a long term care facility.
*'''Dually eligible beneficiaries''', defined as individuals who are entitled to [[Medicare (United States)#Part A: Hospital.2FHospice insurance|Medicare Part A]] and/or Part B and are eligible for some form of [[Medicaid]] benefit.
*'''Beneficiaries with chronic conditions''', defined as individuals who have acquired one or more disabling chronic conditions, including, but not limited to: [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[congestive heart failure]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[mental disorders]], [[Chronic kidney disease|ESRD]], and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].

'''''Thin''''' (often styled as '''''THIN''''') is a 2006 [[cinéma vérité]] documentary film directed by [[Lauren Greenfield]] and distributed by [[HBO]]. It was filmed at The Renfrew Center of Florida in [[Coconut Creek, Florida|Coconut Creek]], a 40-bed residential facility for the treatment of women with eating disorders. The film follows four women with [[anorexia nervosa]], [[bulimia nervosa]] and [[EDNOS|other eating disorders]] in their struggle for recovery. It premiered to the general public November 14, 2006 on HBO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laurengreenfield.com/index.php?p=KZQ3GTAF ''THIN'' Synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

Greenfield describes the making of ''Thin'' as "[...] a continuation of my decade-long exploration of body image and the way the female body has become a primary expression of identity for girls and women in our time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laurengreenfield.com/index.php?p=C2JIGFV1 Director's Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenfield first visited The Renfrew Center in 1997 on assignment for ''Time'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laurengreenfield.com/index.php?p=R215BRG7 Why Thin?]&lt;/ref&gt; She later returned to photograph young women for her personal project, the [[photo-book]] and art exhibition, ''Girl Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smith.edu/artmuseum2/archived_exhibitions/thin/background_information_lauren_greenfield.htm Thin and Girl Culture - Smith College Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; Following multiple trips to the facility, she gained their trust and support to begin using it to film ''Thin'', her directorial debut which she produced in collaboration with [[R.J. Cutler]].

Living at the center for six months, Greenfield and director of photography Amanda Micheli received unrestricted access to film staff meetings, therapy sessions, mealtimes and daily weigh-ins that depict the highly structured routine of inpatients' daily lives. The film explores their turbulent interpersonal relationships, and highlights the efforts of the Renfrew medical team and the complex tasks they face.

==Main Participants==

===Shelly===
'''Shelly Guillory''' is a 25-year-old psychiatric nurse who enters the Center at the beginning of the film with a [[PEG tube|PEG]] [[feeding tube]]  surgically implanted in her stomach. She admits herself into Renfrew after ten hospitalizations. On her arrival she weighs 84.3 pounds, having been anorexic for six years and tube fed for five of those years. She has an identical twin, Kelly, who does not have an eating disorder.

Shelly describes a reliance on various mood stabilizers and tranquilizers and has volatile mood swings throughout the film, in particular getting very angry and aggressive when stolen food mistakenly attributed to her and pulse deficits lead to her being accused of purging.

The epilogue states that Shelly lost 17 pounds after discharge and underwent [[electric shock therapy]] to treat her depression.

===Polly===
'''Pollack "Polly" Ann Williams''' has been at Renfrew for nine weeks. She admitted herself after a suicide attempt over two slices of pizza, explaining that while they weren't the whole motivation, they were "kind of the straw that broke the camel's back".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laurengreenfield.com/index.php?p=OM82ZBUV Meet Polly]&lt;/ref&gt; When interviewed she says that "dieting has always been a huge part of my life" and that she was "counting calories and counting fat by the time [she] was 11".

She celebrates her 30th birthday in the Center and seems to be making progress with her anorexia but has trouble with some of the rules. She is expelled after Shelly tells the staff about Polly getting the NEDA symbol tattooed on her hip while on a day pass from the Center. This incident was compounded by Polly's disruptive history, which included smoking in her bathroom (a fact she admitted during a Community Group therapy session) and giving mood stabilizers to Shelly. Shelly told staff that Polly had given her [[Neurontin]] after the pills were discovered in her room during a routine check for contraband.

Upon being given her 24-hour notice to leave, Polly expresses despair and purges on camera. She was described in the epilogue as continuing to have trouble with purging and weight loss, and that she ultimately passed away in February 2008 at age 33.

===Brittany===
'''Brittany Robinson''' is a 15-year-old student who was admitted to Renfrew with liver damage, a low heart rate and hair loss after dropping from 185 to 97 pounds in less than a year. She describes herself as a compulsive overeater from the age of 8, leading into compulsive dieting and anorexia from the age of 12, citing "a bad body image" and a craving for acceptance amongst her peers as her motivation to lose weight.

According to Brittany, her mother also has an eating disorder and in an interview, Brittany describes how they would have "the greatest time" with [[EDNOS|"chew and spit"]]; chewing "bags and bags of candy" and spitting it out without swallowing. Her mother's experience of anorexia is touched upon in greater detail in an interview in the film's companion book, also titled {{cite book|title=THIN|isbn=0-8118-5633-X}}

Throughout the film Brittany is resistant to recovery, explaining that she would like to lose "another forty pounds" and that she "just want[s] to be thin". She tells her nutritionist she has purged twelve times since entering Renfrew and walks out of group therapy in tears when her dedication to recovery is challenged by Polly.

Brittany's insurance benefits run out, forcing her to leave treatment early. She relapses into anorexia before leaving, prompting concern amongst patients and staff, and is released against medical advice.

The epilogue states that she began to restrict after discharge and lost weight rapidly. Insurance would not pay for further treatment.

===Alisa===
'''Alisa Williams''', a 30-year-old divorced mother of two, traces her eating issues back to an incident at the pediatrician when she was 7 and put on a diet which then led to anorexia. She describes massive binge/purge sessions which resulted in hospitalizations due to the resulting dehydration and her severe abuse of diuretics, hydrochlorothiazide, laxatives, enemas and [[ipecac]].

Apart from her binges, which she describes as occurring "every few weeks or so, over and over again, for three or four days", she was restricting to under 200 calories a day prior to entering Renfrew. She had been hospitalized five times in the three months leading to her admittance to the Center.  Having struggled with her eating disorder for 16 years, Alisa took disability leave from her job as a pharmaceutical rep in order to enter treatment.

Alisa seems to respond well to Renfrew and towards the end of her stay expresses a desire to "taste recovery".

After discharge, Alisa struggles through dinner with her children and Shelly at a restaurant. She picks at her food and takes tiny bites. The film later shows Alisa, agitated and pacing around her home, distract her two children with cartoons and waffles as she enters her bathroom to purge repeatedly. The epilogue reveals that she would go on to lose 20 pounds and attempt suicide, and that she returned to Renfrew for treatment and maintained a healthy weight after leaving.

==Participant status updates==
* In 2008, Shelly reported that she was successfully recovering from her eating disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2medusa.com/2008/02/anorexia-update-from-shelly-from-hbo.html ANOREXIA: AN UPDATE FROM SHELLY FROM THE HBO DOCUMENTARY, THIN...]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polly moved to Chattanooga after leaving Renfrew, went back to school to study photography and was managing a studio at the time of the film's release. She died at her residence on February 8, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_121759.asp Chattanoogan Obituaries]&lt;/ref&gt; Her death is believed to have been a suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesshollywood.com/Polly-Williams-Of-HBOs-Thin-Found-Dead_article_8390 Access Hollywood]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three years after the filming, Brittany mentioned going to rehab for a heroin addiction on her MySpace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110102074703/http://www.myspace.com/22866317/blog/485472818 i am the eggman's Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
''Thin'' was selected for competition at the 2006 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and won the John Grierson Award for best feature-length documentary at the [[London Film Festival]] 2006. It has also screened at Hot Docs and Full Frame, as well as film festivals in Chicago, Vancouver, Austin, St. Louis, Ojai, Galway and Sweden. It received the 2006 Documentary Grand Jury Prize at the Boston Independent Film Festival, Newport International Film Festival and Jackson Hole Film Festival.

==History==
Translational bioinformatics is a relatively young field within translational research.&lt;ref name=CCTSI&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CCTSI)|url=http://cctsi.ucdenver.edu/RIIC/Pages/WhatisTranslationalInformatics.aspx|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ouzonis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ouzounis|first=C.

J.|title=Drug research and translational bioinformatics|journal=Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|year=2012|volume=91|issue=6|pages=960–962|doi=10.1038/clpt.2012.45}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered a decision support tool that could integrate biomedical information into decision-making processes that otherwise would have been omitted due to the nature of human memory and thinking patterns.&lt;ref name=Lesko/&gt;

Initially, the focus of TBI was on [[ontology]] and vocabulary designs for searching the mass data stores. However, this attempt was largely unsuccessful as preliminary attempts for [[automation]] resulted in misinformation. TBI needed to develop a baseline for cross-referencing data with higher order algorithms in order to link data, structures and functions in networks.&lt;ref name=Ouzonis/&gt; This went hand in hand with a focus on developing curriculum for graduate level programs and capitalization for funding on the growing public acknowledgement of the potential opportunity in TBI.&lt;ref name=Ouzonis/&gt;

When the first draft of the [[human genome]] was completed in the early 2000s, TBI continued to grow and demonstrate prominence as a means to bridge biological findings with [[health informatics|clinical informatics]], impacting the opportunities for both industries of biology and healthcare.&lt;ref name=Sarkar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarkar|first=I.

B.|title=Translational bioinformatics: The year in review|url=http://rbaltman.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achievements of the field that have been used for knowledge discovery include linking clinical records to genomics data, linking drugs with ancestry, whole genome sequencing for a group with a common disease, and semantics in literature mining.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt; There has been discussion of cooperative efforts to create cross-jurisdictional strategies for TBI, particularly in Europe. The past decade has also seen the development of personalized medicine and data sharing in [[pharmacogenomics]]. These accomplishments have solidified public interest, generated funds for investment in training and further curriculum development, increased demand for skilled personnel in the field and pushed ongoing TBI research and development.&lt;ref name=Ouzonis/&gt;

==Benefits and opportunities==
At present, TBI research spans multiple disciplines; however, the application of TBI in clinical settings remains limited. Currently, it is partially deployed in [[drug development]], regulatory review, and clinical [[medicine]].&lt;ref name=Lesko/&gt; The opportunity for application of TBI is much broader as increasingly medical journals are mentioning the term "informatics" and discussing bioinformatics related topics.&lt;ref name="Butte2008"/&gt; TBI research draws on four main areas of discourse: clinical genomics, genomic medicine, [[pharmacogenomics]], and [[genetic epidemiology]].&lt;ref name=Sarkar/&gt; There are increasing numbers of conferences and forums focused on TBI to create opportunities for knowledge sharing and field development. General topics that appear in recent conferences include: (1) personal genomics and genomic infrastructure, (2) drug and gene research for adverse events, interactions and repurposing of drugs, (3) biomarkers and phenotype representation, (4) sequencing, science and systems medicine, (5) computational and analytical methodologies for TBI, and (6) application of bridging genetic research and clinical practice.&lt;ref name=Lesko/&gt;&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendonca|first=E. A.|title=Selected proceedings of the 2010 summit on translational bioinformatics|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|year=2010|volume=11|issue=9|pages=1–4|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-11-S9-S1|pmid=21044356|pmc=2967739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of bioinformaticians, biologists are able to analyze complex data, set up websites for experimental measurements, facilitate sharing of the measurements, and correlate findings to clinical outcomes.&lt;ref name="Butte2008"/&gt; Translational bioinformaticians studying a particular disease would have more sample data regarding a given disease than an individual biologist studying the disease alone.

Since the completion of the [[human genome]], new projects are now attempting to systematically analyze all the gene alterations in a disease like [[cancer]] rather than focusing on a few genes at a time. In the future, large-scale data will be integrated from different sources in order to extract functional information. The availability of a large number of human genomes will allow for statistical mining of their relation to lifestyles, drug interactions, and other factors. Translational bioinformatics is therefore transforming the search for disease genes and is becoming a crucial component of other areas of medical research including [[pharmacogenomics]].&lt;ref name=Kann&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kann|first=M. G.|title=Advances in translational bioinformatics: Computational approaches for the hunting of disease genes|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|year=2010|volume=11|issue=1|pages=96–110|pmid=20007728|doi=10.1093/bib/bbp048|pmc=2810112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study evaluating the computational and economic characteristics of [[cloud computing]] in performing a large-scale data integration and analysis of genomic medicine, cloud-based analysis had similar cost and performance in comparison to a local computational cluster. This suggests that cloud-computing technologies might be a valuable and economical technology for facilitating large-scale [[translational research]] in genomic medicine.&lt;ref name=Dudley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dudley|first=J. T.|title=Translational bioinformatics in the cloud: An affordable alternative|journal=Genome Medicine|volume=2|issue=8|pages=51|doi=10.1186/gm172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodologies==

===Storage===
Vast amounts of bioinformatical data are currently available and continue to increase. For instance, the GenBank database, funded by the National Institute of Health (NHI), currently holds 82 billion [[nucleotides]] in 78 million sequences coding for 270,000 species. The equivalent of GenBank for [[gene expression]] microarrays, known as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), has over 183,000 samples from 7,200 experiments and this number doubles or triples each year. The [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] (EBI) has a similar database called ArrayExpress which has over 100 000 samples from over 3,000 experiments. All together, TBI has access to more than a quarter million microarray samples at present.&lt;ref name="Butte2008" /&gt;

To extract relevant data from large data sets, TBI employs various methods such as data consolidation, data federation, and [[data warehouse|data warehousing]]. In the data consolidation approach, data is extracted from various sources and centralized in a single database. This approach enables standardization of heterogeneous data and helps address issues in interoperability and compatibility among data sets. However, proponents of this method often encounter difficulties in updating their databases as it is based on a single data model. In contrast, the data federation approach links databases together and extracts data on a regular basis, then combines the data for queries. The benefit of this approach is that it enables the user to access real-time data on a single portal. However, the limitation of this is that data collected may not always be synchronized as it is derived from multiple sources. [[data warehouse|Data warehousing]] provides a single unified platform for data curation. [[data warehouse|Data warehousing]] ingrates data from multiple sources into a common format, and is typically used in bioscience exclusively for decision support purposes.&lt;ref name="Yan2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yan|first=Q|title=Translational bioinformatics and systems biology approaches for personalized medicine|journal=Methods Mol Biol|year=2010|volume=662|pages=167–178|doi=10.1007/978-1-60761-800-3_8|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/R4477PV4GW24N6U5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytics===
Analytic techniques serve to translate biological data using high-throughput techniques into clinically relevant information. Currently, numerous software and methodologies for querying data exist, and this number continues to grow as more studies are conducted and published in bioinformatics journals such as ''[[Genome Biology]]'', ''[[BMC Bioinformatics]]'', ''BMC Genomics'', and ''[[Bioinformatics (journal)|Bioinformatics]]''. To ascertain the best analytical technique, tools such as Weka have been created to cipher through the array of software’s and select the most appropriate technique abstracting away the need to know a specific methodology.&lt;ref name=Butte2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butte|first=A. J.|title=Translational bioinformatics applications in genome medicine|journal=Genome Med|year=2009|volume=1|issue=6|doi=10.1186/gm64|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/gm64.pdf|pmid=19566916|pmc=2703873|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration===
[[Data integration]] involves developing methods that use biological information for the clinical setting. Integrating data empowers clinician’s with tools for data access, [[knowledge extraction|knowledge discovery]], and decision support. [[Data integration]] serves to utilize the wealth of information available in bioinformatics to improve patient health and safety. An example of data integration is the use of [[decision support systems]] (DSS) based on translational bioinformatics. DSS used in this regard identify correlations in patient [[electronic medical records]] (EMR) and other clinical information systems to assist clinicians in their diagnoses.&lt;ref name="Yan2010"/&gt;

==Cost==

Companies are now able to provide whole human [[whole genome sequencing|genome sequencing]] and analysis as a simple outsourced service. Second- and third-generation versions of sequencing systems are planned to increase the amount of genomes per day, per instrument, to 80. According to the CEO of Complete Genomics Cliff Reid, the total market for whole human genome sequencing around the world has increased five-fold during 2009 and 2010, and was estimated to be 15,000 genomes for 2011. Furthermore, if the price were to fall to $1,000 per genome, he maintained that the company would still be able to make a profit. The company is also working on process improvements to bring down the internal cost to around $100 per genome, excluding sample-prep and labor costs.&lt;ref name=Heger&gt;{{cite news|last=Heger|first=M|title=Complete genomics targets 2015 for new instruments with capacity of 80 genomes per day|url=http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/complete-genomics-targets-2015-new-instruments-capacity-80-genomes-day|accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Complete genomics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Complete genomics|url=http://www.completegenomics.com/|accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] (NHGRI), the costs to sequence the entire [[genome]] has significantly decreased from over $95 million in 2001 to $7,666 in January 2012. Similarly, the cost of determining one megabase (a million bases) has also decreased from over $5,000 in 2001 to $0.09 in 2012. In 2008, sequencing centers transitioned from Sanger-based (dideoxy chain termination sequencing) to 'second generation' (or 'next-generation') [[DNA sequencing]] technologies. This caused a significant drop in sequencing costs.&lt;ref name=GenomeGov&gt;{{cite web|last=Wetterstrand|first=K. A.|title=DNA sequencing costs: Data from the NHGRI Genome sequencing program (GSP)|url=http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts|accessdate=November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future directions==
TBI has the potential to play a significant role in medicine; however, many challenges still remain. The overarching goal for TBI is to "develop informatics approaches for linking across traditionally disparate data and knowledge sources enabling both the generation and testing of new hypotheses".&lt;ref name=Sarkar/&gt; Current applications of TBI face challenges due to a lack of standards resulting in diverse data collection methodologies. Furthermore, analytic and storage capabilities are hindered due to large volumes of data present in current research. This problem is projected to increase with personal genomics as it will create an even greater accumulation of data.&lt;ref name=Ouzonis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sarkar/&gt;

Challenges also exist in the research of drugs and biomarkers, genomic medicine, protein design metagenomics, infectious disease discovery, [[data curation]], literature mining, and workflow development.&lt;ref name=Ouzonis/&gt; Continued belief in the opportunity and benefits of TBI justifies further funding for infrastructure, intellectual property protection and accessibility policies.&lt;ref name=Ouzonis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Azu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Azuaje|first=F. J.|last2=Heymann|first2=M.|last3=Ternes|first3=A.|last4=Wienecke-Baldacchino|first4=A.|last5=Struck|first5=D.|last6=Moes|first6=D.|last7=Schneider|first7=R.|title=Bioinformatics as a driver, not a passenger, of translational biomedical research: Perspectives from the 6th Benelux bioinformatics conference|journal=Journal of Clinical Bioinformatics|year=2012|volume=2|issue=7|pages=1–3|doi=10.1186/2043-9113-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available funding for TBI in the past decade has increased.&lt;ref name="Butte2008"/&gt; The demand for translational bioinformatics research is in part due to the growth in numerous areas of [[bioinformatics]] and [[health informatics]] and in part due to the popular support of projects like the [[Human Genome Project]].&lt;ref name=Shah/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sarkar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Butte2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butte|first=A. J.|last2=Chen|first2=R.|title=Finding disease-related genomic experiments within an international repository: First steps in translational bioinformatics|journal=AMIA Annu Symp Proc|year=2006|pages=106–110|pmid=17238312|pmc=1839582}}&lt;/ref&gt; This growth and influx of funding has enabled the industry to produce assets such as a repository of [[gene expression]] data and genomic scale data while also making progress towards the concept of creating a $1000 genome and completing the [[Human Genome Project]].&lt;ref name=Sarkar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Butte2006/&gt; It is believed by some that TBI will cause a cultural shift in the way scientific and clinical information are processed within the pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies, and clinical practice. It is also seen as a means to shift clinical trial designs away from case studies and towards EMR analysis.&lt;ref name=Lesko/&gt;

Leaders in the field have presented numerous predictions with regards to the direction TBI is, and should take. A collection of predictions is as follows:
#Lesko (2012) states that strategy must occur in the European Union to bridge the gap between academic and industry in the following ways – directly quoted:&lt;ref name=Lesko/&gt;
##Validate and publish informatics data and technology models to accepted standards in order to facilitate adoption, 
##Transform electronic health records to make them more accessible and interoperable, 
##Encourage information sharing, engage regulatory agencies, and 
##Encourage increasing financial support to grow and develop TBI
#Altman (2011), at the 2011 AMIA Summit on TBI, predicts that:&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;
##Cloud computing will contribute to major biomedical discovery.
##Informatics applications to stem cell science will increase
##Immune genomics will emerge as powerful data
##Flow cytometry informatics will grow
##Molecular &amp; expression data will combine for drug repurposing
##Exome sequencing will persist longer than expected Progress in interpreting non-coding DNA variations
#Sarkar, [[Atul Butte|Butte]], [[Yves A. Lussier|Lussier]], Tarczy-Hornoch &amp; Ohno-Machado (2011) state that the future of TBI must establish a way to manage the large amount of available data and look to integrate findings from projects such as the eMERGE (Electronic Medical Records and Genomics) project funded by NIH, the Personal Genome Project, the Exome Project, the Million Veteran Program and the 1000 Genomes Project.&lt;ref name=Sarkar/&gt;

"In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else—a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that it might consume." (Herbert Simon,1971).

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Tuberculosis''' ('''TB''') is an [[infectious disease]] usually caused by ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' (MTB) [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name=WHO2015Fact/&gt; Tuberculosis generally affects the [[lung]]s, but can also affect other parts of the body.&lt;ref name=WHO2015Fact/&gt; Most infections do not have symptoms, in which case it is known as [[latent tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=WHO2015Fact/&gt; About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected.&lt;ref name=WHO2015Fact/&gt; The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic [[cough]] with [[hemoptysis|blood-containing]] [[sputum]], [[fever]], [[night sweats]], and [[weight loss]].&lt;ref name=WHO2015Fact/&gt; It was historically called "'''consumption'''" due to the weight loss.&lt;ref name=Cha1998&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chambers Dictionary.|year=1998|publisher=Allied Chambers India Ltd.|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-86062-25-8|pages=352|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA352|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906201311/https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA352|archive-date=6 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infection]] of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.&lt;ref name=ID10&gt;{{cite book|last=Dolin|first=[edited by] Gerald L.

Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the [[lung]]s (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).&lt;ref name=ID10/&gt; Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.&lt;ref name=ID10/&gt;

General signs and symptoms include [[fever]], [[chills]], [[night sweats]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], [[weight loss]], and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].&lt;ref name=ID10/&gt; Significant [[nail clubbing]] may also occur.&lt;ref name=Pet2005/&gt;

During this process, the bacterium is enveloped by the macrophage and stored temporarily in a membrane-bound vesicle called a phagosome. The phagosome then combines with a lysosome to create a phagolysosome. In the phagolysosome, the cell attempts to use [[reactive oxygen species]] and acid to kill the bacterium.  However, ''M. tuberculosis'' has a thick, waxy [[mycolic acid]] capsule that protects it from these toxic substances. ''M. tuberculosis'' is able to reproduce inside the macrophage and will eventually kill the immune cell.

The primary site of infection in the lungs, known as the "[[Ghon focus]]", is generally located in either the upper part of the lower lobe, or the lower part of the [[lung|upper lobe]].&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt; Tuberculosis of the lungs may also occur via infection from the blood stream.

Tuberculosis is classified as one of the [[granuloma]]tous inflammatory diseases. [[Macrophage]]s, [[T cell|T lymphocytes]], [[B cell|B lymphocytes]], and [[fibroblast]]s &lt;!-- are among the cells that --&gt; aggregate to form [[granuloma]]s, with [[lymphocytes]] surrounding the infected macrophages. When other macrophages attack the infected macrophage, they fuse together to form a giant multinucleated cell in the alveolar lumen. The granuloma may prevent dissemination of the mycobacteria and provide a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system.&lt;ref name=Grosset /&gt;  However, more recent evidence suggests that the bacteria use the granulomas to avoid destruction by the host's immune system.  Macrophages and [[dendritic cell]]s in the granulomas are unable to present antigen to lymphocytes; thus the immune response is suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bozzano F, Marras F, De Maria A | title = Immunology of tuberculosis | journal = Mediterranean Journal of Hematology and Infectious Diseases | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = e2014027 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24804000 | pmc = 4010607 | doi = 10.4084/MJHID.2014.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant, resulting in latent infection. Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death ([[necrosis]]) in the center of [[Tubercle (anatomy)|tubercles]].  To the naked eye, this has the texture of soft, white cheese and is termed [[caseous necrosis]].&lt;ref name=Grosset&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grosset J | title = Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the extracellular compartment: an underestimated adversary | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 833–6 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12604509 | pmc = 149338 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.47.3.833-836.2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many people, the infection waxes and wanes.

==Management==
{{Main|Tuberculosis management}}
Treatment of TB uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brennan PJ, Nikaido H | title = The envelope of mycobacteria | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 64 | pages = 29–63 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7574484 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.64.070195.000333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latent TB is treated with either isoniazid alone, or a combination of isoniazid with either rifampicin or rifapentine.&lt;ref name="WHOlatent2018"&gt;{{cite book | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] | title=Latent tuberculosis infection | year=2018 | page=23 | isbn=978-92-4-155023-9 | url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/260233/9789241550239-eng.pdf;jsessionid=E08401544A59BE3F84C645C9A9A7B0E5?sequence=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borisov |first1=AS |last2=Bamrah Morris |first2=S |last3=Njie |first3=GJ |last4=Winston |first4=CA |last5=Burton |first5=D |last6=Goldberg |first6=S |last7=Yelk Woodruff |first7=R |last8=Allen |first8=L |last9=LoBue |first9=P |last10=Vernon |first10=A |title=Update of Recommendations for Use of Once-Weekly Isoniazid-Rifapentine Regimen to Treat Latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection. |journal=MMWR.

Active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing [[antibiotic resistance]].&lt;ref name=Lancet11/&gt;

===New onset===
The recommended treatment of new-onset pulmonary tuberculosis, as of 2010, is six months of a combination of antibiotics containing rifampicin, isoniazid, [[pyrazinamide]], and [[ethambutol]] for the first two months, and only rifampicin and isoniazid for the last four months.&lt;ref name=Lancet11/&gt; Where resistance to isoniazid is high, ethambutol may be added for the last four months as an alternative.&lt;ref name=Lancet11/&gt;

===Recurrent disease===
If tuberculosis recurs, testing to determine which antibiotics it is sensitive to is important before determining treatment.&lt;ref name=Lancet11/&gt; If [[Multidrug-resistant TB|multiple drug-resistant TB]] (MDR-TB) is detected, treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 to 24&amp;nbsp;months is recommended.&lt;ref name=Lancet11/&gt;

===Medication administration===
[[Directly observed therapy]], i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Arch G. |author2=III Mainous |title=Management of Antimicrobials in Infectious Diseases: Impact of Antibiotic Resistance |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, N.J. |year=2010 |pages=69 |isbn=978-1-60327-238-4 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hwVFAPLYznsC&amp;pg=PA69 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906215558/https://books.google.com/books?id=hwVFAPLYznsC&amp;pg=PA69 |archive-date=6 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality.&lt;ref name=Karumbi2015 /&gt; There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine.&lt;ref name=Karumbi2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karumbi J, Garner P | title = Directly observed therapy for treating tuberculosis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 5 | pages = CD003343 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 26022367 | pmc = 4460720 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003343.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker.&lt;ref name=Karumbi2015 /&gt; Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu Q, Abba K, Alejandria MM, Sinclair D, Balanag VM, Lansang MA | title = Reminder systems to improve patient adherence to tuberculosis clinic appointments for diagnosis and treatment | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 11 | pages = CD006594 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25403701 | pmc = 4448217 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006594.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medication resistance===
Primary resistance occurs when a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis|MTB]] may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication.&lt;ref name=OBrien&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Brien RJ | title = Drug-resistant tuberculosis: etiology, management and prevention | journal = Seminars in Respiratory Infections | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 104–12 | date = June 1994 | pmid = 7973169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. [[Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis|Extensively drug-resistant TB]] is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs.&lt;ref name="MMWR2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | title = Emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with extensive resistance to second-line drugs--worldwide, 2000-2004 | journal = MMWR.

Progression from TB infection to overt TB disease occurs when the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt; However, in the majority of cases, a [[Latent tuberculosis|latent infection]] occurs with no obvious symptoms.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt; These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.&lt;ref name=Pet2005/&gt;

The risk of reactivation increases with immunosuppression, such as that caused by infection with HIV. In people coinfected with ''M. tuberculosis'' and HIV, the risk of reactivation increases to 10% per year.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt; Studies using DNA fingerprinting of ''M. tuberculosis'' strains have shown reinfection contributes more substantially to recurrent TB than previously thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lambert ML, Hasker E, Van Deun A, Roberfroid D, Boelaert M, Van der Stuyft P | title = Recurrence in tuberculosis: relapse or reinfection? | journal = The Lancet.

&lt;!-- Ancient history --&gt;
Tuberculosis has been present in humans since [[Ancient history|antiquity]].&lt;ref name=Lancet11/&gt; The earliest unambiguous detection of ''M. tuberculosis'' involves evidence of the disease in the remains of bison in Wyoming dated to around 17,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothschild BM, Martin LD, Lev G, Bercovier H, Bar-Gal GK, Greenblatt C, Donoghue H, Spigelman M, Brittain D | title = Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA from an extinct bison dated 17,000 years before the present | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 305–11 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11438894 | doi = 10.1086/321886 | url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?CID001531 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, whether tuberculosis originated in bovines, then was transferred to humans, or whether it diverged from a common ancestor, is currently unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pearce-Duvet JM | title = The origin of human pathogens: evaluating the role of agriculture and domestic animals in the evolution of human disease | journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | pages = 369–82 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16672105 | doi = 10.1017/S1464793106007020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison of the [[gene]]s of ''M. tuberculosis'' complex (MTBC) in humans to MTBC in animals suggests humans did not acquire MTBC from animals during animal domestication, as was previously believed.

[[File:RobertKoch.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Robert Koch discovered the tuberculosis bacillus.]]

The bacillus causing tuberculosis, ''M. tuberculosis'', was identified and described on 24 March 1882 by [[Robert Koch]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine]] in 1905 for this discovery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nobel Foundation]]. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1905.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210184150/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/ |date=10 December 2006 }} Accessed 7 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Koch did not believe the bovine (cattle) and human tuberculosis diseases were similar, which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection. Later, the risk of transmission from this source was dramatically reduced by the invention of the [[pasteurization]] process. Koch announced a [[glycerine]] extract of the tubercle bacilli as a "remedy" for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it "tuberculin". While it was not effective, it was later successfully adapted as a screening test for the presence of pre-symptomatic tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waddington K | title = To stamp out "so terrible a malady": bovine tuberculosis and tuberculin testing in Britain, 1890-1939 | journal = Medical History | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–48 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14968644 | pmc = 546294 | doi = 10.1017/S0025727300007043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Tuberculosis Day]] is marked on 24 March each year, the anniversary of Koch’s original scientific announcement.

[[Albert Calmette]] and [[Camille Guérin]] achieved the first genuine success in immunization against tuberculosis in 1906, using attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis. It was called [[BCG vaccine|bacille Calmette–Guérin]] (BCG). The BCG vaccine was first used on humans in 1921 in France,&lt;ref name=Bonah&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonah C | title = The 'experimental stable' of the BCG vaccine: safety, efficacy, proof, and standards, 1921-1933 | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 696–721 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16337557 | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsc.2005.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but received widespread acceptance in the US, Great Britain, and Germany only after World War II.&lt;ref name=Comstock&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Comstock GW | title = The International Tuberculosis Campaign: a pioneering venture in mass vaccination and research | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 528–40 | date = September 1994 | pmid = 7811874 | doi = 10.1093/clinids/19.3.528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuberculosis caused widespread public concern in the 19th and early 20th centuries as the disease became common among the urban poor. In 1815, one in four deaths in England was due to "consumption". By 1918, one in six deaths in France was still caused by TB. After TB was determined to be contagious, in the 1880s, it was put on a [[List of notifiable diseases|notifiable disease]] list in Britain; campaigns were started to stop people from spitting in public places, and the infected poor were "encouraged" to enter [[sanatorium|sanatoria]] that resembled prisons (the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention).&lt;ref name =sanatoria/&gt; Whatever the benefits of the "fresh air" and labor in the sanatoria, even under the best conditions, 50% of those who entered died within five years (c. 1916).&lt;ref name =sanatoria/&gt; When the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] was formed in Britain in 1913, its initial focus was tuberculosis research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=editor|first=Caroline Hannaway,|title=Biomedicine in the twentieth century: practices, policies, and politics|year=2008|publisher=IOS Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-1-58603-832-8|pages=233|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5HBxyg5APIC&amp;pg=PA233|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907185226/https://books.google.com/books?id=o5HBxyg5APIC&amp;pg=PA233|archive-date=7 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Current reemergence --&gt;
Because of the emergence of MDR-TB, surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections.

A 2014 the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU]]-healthcare report that the need to address apathy and urging for increased funding. The report cites among others Lucica Ditui "[TB] is like an orphan. It has been neglected even in countries with a high burden and often forgotten by donors and those investing in health interventions."&lt;ref name="EIU 2014"/&gt;

Slow progress has led to frustration, expressed by the executive director of the [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] – Mark Dybul: "we have the tools to end TB as a pandemic and public health threat on the planet, but we are not doing it."&lt;ref name="EIU 2014"/&gt; Several international organizations are pushing for more transparency in treatment, and more countries are implementing mandatory reporting of cases to the government, although adherence is often sketchy. Commercial treatment providers may at times overprescribe second-line drugs as well as supplementary treatment, promoting demands for further regulations.&lt;ref name="EIU 2014"/&gt; The government of Brazil provides universal TB-care, which reduces this problem.&lt;ref name="EIU 2014"/&gt; Conversely, falling rates of TB-infection may not relate to the number of programs directed at reducing infection rates but may be tied to increased level of education, income, and health of the population.&lt;ref name="EIU 2014"/&gt; Costs of the disease, as calculated by the World Bank in 2009 may exceed 150 billion USD per year in "high burden" countries.&lt;ref name="EIU 2014"/&gt; Lack of progress eradicating the disease may also be due to lack of patient follow-up – as among the 250M [[migration in China|rural migrants in China]].&lt;ref name="EIU 2014"/&gt;

===Stigma===
Slow progress in preventing the disease may in part be due to [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with TB.&lt;ref name="EIU 2014"/&gt; Stigma may be due to the fear of transmission from affected individuals. This stigma may additionally arise due to links between TB and poverty, and in [[AIDS in Africa|Africa, AIDS]].&lt;ref name="EIU 2014"/&gt; Such stigmatization may be both real and perceived; for example, in Ghana individuals with TB are banned from attending public gatherings.&lt;ref name="Courtwright 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Courtwright A, Turner AN | title = Tuberculosis and stigmatization: pathways and interventions | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 125 Suppl 4 | issue = 4_suppl | pages = 34–42 | date = Jul–Aug 2010 | pmid = 20626191 | pmc = 2882973 | doi = 10.1177/00333549101250S407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stigma towards TB may result in delays in seeking treatment,&lt;ref name="EIU 2014"/&gt; lower treatment compliance, and family members keeping cause of death secret&lt;ref name="Courtwright 2010"/&gt; – allowing the disease to spread further.&lt;ref name="EIU 2014"/&gt; In contrast, in Russia stigma was associated with increased treatment compliance.&lt;ref name="Courtwright 2010"/&gt; TB stigma also affects socially marginalized individuals to a greater degree and varies between regions.&lt;ref name="Courtwright 2010"/&gt;

One way to decrease stigma may be through the promotion of "TB clubs", where those infected may share experiences and offer support, or through counseling.&lt;ref name="Courtwright 2010"/&gt; Some studies have shown TB education programs to be effective in decreasing stigma, and may thus be effective in increasing treatment adherence.&lt;ref name="Courtwright 2010"/&gt; Despite this, studies on the relationship between reduced stigma and mortality are lacking as of 2010, and similar efforts to decrease stigma surrounding AIDS have been minimally effective.&lt;ref name="Courtwright 2010"/&gt; Some have claimed the stigma to be worse than the disease, and healthcare providers may unintentionally reinforce stigma, as those with TB are often perceived as difficult or otherwise undesirable.&lt;ref name="EIU 2014"/&gt; A greater understanding of the social and cultural dimensions of tuberculosis may also help with stigma reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mason PH, Roy A, Spillane J, Singh P | title = SOCIAL, HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL DIMENSIONS OF TUBERCULOSIS | journal = Journal of Biosocial Science | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 206–32 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 25997539 | doi = 10.1017/S0021932015000115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2015}}, tuberculosis appears to be widespread among captive [[elephant]]s in the US.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5329">The '''two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method''' is a method for combining a number of related types of information into a single, immediately meaningful, index that allows comparisons to be made across different locations. Its importance lies in the improvement over considering the individual sources of information separately, where none on its own provides an adequate summary.

==Background==

The two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method is a special case of a [[gravity model]] of [[Spatial analysis#Spatial interaction|spatial interaction]] that was developed to measure spatial accessibility to [[primary care physician]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luo and Wang 2003a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LWb"&gt;Luo and Wang 2003b&lt;/ref&gt; 2SFCA can also be used to measure other accessibility such as accessibility to jobs, to [[cancer care]] facilities, etc. It was inspired by the spatial decomposition idea first proposed by Radke and Mu (2000).

The 2SFCA method not only has most of the advantages of a gravity model, but is also intuitive to interpret, as it uses essentially a special form of physician-to-population ratio. It is easy to implement in a [[Geographic information system|GIS]] environment.&lt;ref name="LWb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang and Luo, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, 2006: 80-95&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the 2SFCA method measures spatial accessibility as a ratio of primary-care physicians to population, combining two steps:
#it first assesses “physician availability” at the physicians' (supply) locations as the ratio of physicians to their surrounding population (i.e., within a threshold travel time from the physicians)
#it sums up the ratios (i.e., physician availability derived in the first step) around (i.e., within the same threshold travel time from) each residential (demand) location.

It has been recently enhanced by considering [[distance decay]] within catchments&lt;ref&gt;Luo and Qi, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and called the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method.

Furthermore, the use of capping certain services according to nearby population size,can improve the accuracy when analyzing across areas of different environments&lt;ref&gt;McGrail and Humphreys, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. rural and urban).

The method has been applied to other related public health issues, such as access to healthy food retailers&lt;ref&gt;Chen, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Definition==
Unwarranted variation (or geographic variation) in health care service delivery refers to differences that cannot be explained by illness, medical need, or the dictates of evidence-based medicine. The term was coined by Dr. [[John Wennberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_22/b3986001.htm Medical Guesswork] Businessweek.com  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105163103/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_22/b3986001.htm |date=November 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2017}}  
It can be caused by shortfalls in three areas:

* Effective care and patient safety, which includes services of proven clinical effectiveness, such as using [[lipid-lowering agent]]s in patients with coronary artery disease
* Preference-sensitive treatments, treatment for conditions that have trade-offs in terms of risks and benefits for the patient, though the choice of care should be driven by the patient's preferences
* Supply-sensitive care, which is strongly correlated with healthcare system resource capacity and generally provided in the absence of medical evidence and clinical theory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthdialog.com/hd/Core/Analytics/UnwarrantedVariation.htm Unwarranted Variation] Health Dialog, healthdialog.com  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211043616/http://www.healthdialog.com/hd/Core/Analytics/UnwarrantedVariation.htm |date=December 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1967, while working in the Regional Medical Program{{clarify|date=October 2015}} created with a $350,000 grant from President [[Lyndon Johnson]],  Wennberg analyzed Medicare data to determine how well hospitals and doctors were serving their communities. He found 4 types of variation: the underuse of effective care, variations in outcomes attributable to the quality of care, the misuse of preference-sensitive treatments and overuse of supply-sensitive services.&lt;ref name="managedhealthcareexecutive.com"&gt;Michael T. McCue [http://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/mhe/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=46508 Clamping down on variation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218052952/http://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/mhe/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=46508 |date=2007-12-18 }} - Managed Healthcare Executive, February 01, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Health Dialog, a privately held, for-profit disease-management company which was established to address unwarranted variation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If you live in northern Idaho, and you develop back pain, chances are good that you’ll undergo surgery to treat your pain. Move to the southern tip of Texas, however, and the chances that you’ll undergo that same surgery will drop by a factor of 6. The surgery is no more effective in Idaho than it is in Texas. It’s just that doctors in the northwest are more likely than those in southern Texas to recommend surgery. This phenomenon, in which doctors practice medicine differently depending on where they’re from, is called practice pattern variation. And it isn’t limited to treating back pain, or even surgical decisions. There is also variation in treatment for chronic conditions, such as use of beta blockers for individuals with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) or lipid testing for those with diabetes.&lt;ref name="Healthcare 1999"&gt;The Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Wennberg and colleagues at the Dartmouth Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences documented these wide variations in how healthcare is practiced around the United States. They have asserted that most of this variation is unwarranted. [[Health Dialog]] was built to address unwarranted variation in healthcare: the overuse, underuse and misuse of medical care. Wennberg and his colleagues concluded that if unwarranted variation in the US healthcare system could be reduced, the quality of care would go up and healthcare costs would go down. Studies have shown that if unwarranted variation could be reduced in the Medicare population, quality of care would rise dramatically and costs could be lowered by as much as 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher E.S., Wennberg D.E., Stukel T.A., et al. The implications of regional variations in Medicare spending. Part 1. Ann Intern Med. 2003; 138: 273-287.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Extent==
Unwarranted variation in medical practice is costly and deadly as noted by Martin Sipkoff in ''9 Ways To Reduce Unwarranted Variation''. Analysis of Medicare data revealed that per-capita spending per enrollee in Miami was almost 2.5 times as much as in Minneapolis, even after adjusting data for age, sex, and race. According to a 2003 report from the National Committee for Quality Assurance 57,000 lives were lost annually because US physicians have not been using evidence-based medicine to guide their care.&lt;ref name=9ways&gt;[http://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/0311/0311.variation.html 9 Ways To Reduce Unwarranted Variation] Managed Care Magazine, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

"We're literally dying, waiting for the practice of medicine to catch up with medical knowledge," said Margaret O'Kane, president of NCQA. The report, "The State of Health Care Quality 2003," says that the deaths "should not be confused with those attributable to medical errors or lack of access to health care. This report shows that a thousand Americans die each week because the care they get is not consistent with the care that medical science tells us they should get."&lt;ref name=9ways /&gt;

===United States===
Studies show that individuals with diabetes should have blood lipids monitored regularly, yet patients in [[Chicago]] are 50% less likely to receive these tests than patients in [[Fort Lauderdale]]. A patient with heart disease in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], is three times more likely to have bypass surgery than a similar patient in [[Albuquerque]]. In [[Miami]], where medical services are abundant, Medicare pays more than twice as much per person per year as it does in [[Minneapolis]], with no discernible difference in overall health or life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Healthcare 1999"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}

===NHS England===
In November 2010 the Department of Health QIPP Right Care programme published the first NHS Atlas of Variation in Healthcare, inspired by the work of Wennberg.&lt;ref name=nhs&gt;[http://www.rightcare.nhs.uk/index.php/atlas/atlas-of-variation-2010/ The NHS Atlas of Variation in Healthcare] NHS, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; clinicians selected 34 topics,  as being important to their speciality, which were mapped by [[Primary Care Trust]] area, then the healthcare commissioning body. The Atlas was published to challenge commissioners to maximise health outcome and minimise inequalities by addressing unwarranted variation.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Awareness is the first important step in identifying and addressing unwarranted variation; if the existence of variation is unknown, the debate about whether it is unwarranted cannot take place."&lt;ref name=nhs/&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2010 Atlas revealed widespread variations in outcome, quality, cost and activity:
* A twofold variation among strategic health authorities in the incidence of major amputations per 1000 patients with registered Type 2 diabetes and a fivefold variation in the percentage of people with diabetes receiving the NICE recommended nine key care processes
* A fourfold variation in directly-standardised rate of elective admissions in persons diagnosed with epilepsy per 100,000 population
* A threefold variation in the percentage of patients admitted to hospital who spend 90% of their time on a stroke unit
* A fourfold variation in emergency asthma admissions for children and young adults
* A sixfold variation in provision of hip replacement per 1,000 people in need
* A twofold variation in cancer inpatient expenditure per 1,000 population

A further extended Atlas was published in November 2011, mapping variation across 71 indicators and a follow-on series of Atlases focussing on specific themes in more depth like children and young people, diabetes, kidney disease and respiratory disease.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
A forthcoming atlas will be about liver disease, diagnostics, organ donation and transplantation. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
Publication of the Atlases has been well-received within the NHS and by patient groups and clinical societies.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
 
In 2012, the British Department of Health published a mandate for the new NHS Commissioning Board. On variation in healthcare, the Mandate charged the Board with the responsibility to "shine a light on variation" and "to make significant progress... in reducing unjustified variation... Success will be measured not only by the average level of improvement but also by progress in reducing health inequalities and unjustified variation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mandate.dh.gov.uk/ The Mandate: A mandate from the Government to the NHS Commissioning Board] April 2013 to March 2015, Department of Health, November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7,13,27}}

===Nursing, midwifery and care staff framework, England===
In April 2016, Jane Cummings, Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) for England, launched a national strategic framework for nurses, midwives and care staff in England called Leading Change, Adding Value. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/nursing-framework.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This framework sets out the 10 commitments for nurses, midwives and care staff in England towards identifying and addressing unwarranted variation in care practice. The framework builds on the previous CNO strategy 'Compassion in Practice'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/compassion-in-practice.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and identifies the nursing, midwifery and care staff approach to meeting the triple aims of 'improving health outcomes, reducing the care quality gap and effective use of resources' as set out in the Department of Health's Five Year Forward View.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5yfv-web.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Actions to address unwarranted variation in nursing, midwifery and care provision are underpinned by the values of the 6cs,{{clarification needed|date=November 2017}} and a skills and knowledge framework is being developed to support staff in delivering on the 10 commitments set out in the framework.

[[File:1116 Muscle of the Female Perineum.png |thumb|]]
The '''vaginal support structures''' are those [[muscle]]s, [[bone]]s, [[ligament]]s, [[tendon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, membranes and fascia, of the [[pelvic floor]] that maintain the position of the [[vagina]] within the pelvic cavity and allow the normal functioning of the vagina and other reproductive structures in the female. Defects or injuries to these support structures in the pelvic floor leads to [[pelvic organ prolapse]]. Anatomical and congenital variations of vaginal support structures can predispose a woman to further dysfunction and prolapse later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9KuCMWWG8BcC&amp;pg=PA1028&amp;dq=vaginal+rugae&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDwJjtiKnZAhVEcq0KHbZxDPQQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=vaginal%20rugae&amp;f=false|title=Key Topics in Critical Care, Second Edition|last=Craft|first=T.

==Pelvic bones==
The support for the vagina is provided by muscles, membranes, tendons and ligaments. These structures are attached to the [[hip bone]]s. These bones are the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]], [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] and [[ischium]].The interior surface of these pelvic bones and their [[Epicondyle|projections]] and contours are used as attachment sites for the fascia, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support the vagina. These bones are then fuse and attach to the [[sacrum]] behind the vagina and anteriorly at the [[pubic symphysis]].&lt;ref name = herschorn&gt;{{cite journal  |last = Herschorn | first = Sender  | date = 2004 | title = Female Pelvic Floor Anatomy: The Pelvic Floor, Supporting Structures, and Pelvic Organs | journal = Reviews in Urology | volume = 6 | issue = Suppl 5| pages = S2–S10 | issn = 1523-6161 | pmc = 1472875 | pmid = 16985905 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting ligaments include the [[Sacrospinous ligament|sacrospinous]] and [[sacrotuberous ligament]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. The sacrospinous ligament is unusual in that it is thin and triangular.&lt;ref name="herschorn" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ect.downstate.edu/courseware/haonline/figs/l13/130304.htm|title=Human Anatomy|last=|first=|date=|website=ect.downstate.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pelvic diaphragm==
The muscular pelvic diaphragm is composed of the bilateral [[levator ani]] and coccygeus muscles and these attach to the inner pelvic surface. The iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus make up the levator ani muscle. The muscles pass behind the rectum. The levator ani surrounds the opening which the urethra, rectum and vagina pass. The pubococcygeus muscle is subdivided inot the pubourethralis, [[pubovaginal muscle]] and the puborectalis muscle. The names describe the attachments of the muscles to the urethra, vagina, anus, and rectum. The names are also called the pubourethralis, pubovaginalis, puboanalis, and puborectalis muscles and sometimes the pubovisceralis since it attaches to  the viscera.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt; &lt;!--The urethral portion forms part of the periurethral musculature, and the vaginal and anorectal portions insert into the vaginal walls, perineal body, and external anal sphincter muscle.4 The puborectalis portion passes behind the rectum and fuses with its counterpart from the opposite side to form a sling behind the anorectum. Other more posterior parts of the pubococcygeus attach to the coccyx."&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;
"The thin lateral part of the levator ani is the iliococcygeus muscle, which arises from the arcus tendineus of the levator ani to the ischial spine. Posteriorly it attaches to the last 2 segments of the coccyx. The fibers from both sides also fuse to form a raphe and contribute to the anococcygeal ligament. This median raphe between the anus and the coccyx is called the levator plate and is the shelf on which the pelvic organs rest. It is formed by the fusion of the iliococcygeus and the posterior fibers of the pubococcygeus muscles. When the body is in a standing position, the levator plate is horizontal and supports the rectum and upper two thirds of vagina above it. Weakness of the levator ani may loosen the sling behind the anorectum and cause the levator plate to sag.5 This opens the urogenital hiatus and predisposes to pelvic organ prolapse. Women with prolapse have been shown to have an enlarged urogenital hiatus on clinical examination."&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;

"The majority of the strirated muscle fibers in the levator ani are slow-twitch fibers that maintain constant tone with an increased density of fast-twitch (type II) fibers distributed in the periurethral and perianal areas. The levator ani maintains tone in the upright position to support the pelvic viscera and counteracts increased intra-abdominal pressures."&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;--&gt;

==Urogenital diaphragm (perineal membrane)==

The urogenital diaphragm, or [[perineal membrane]], is present over the anterior pelvic outlet below the pelvic diaphragm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unifr.ch/ifaa/Public/EntryPage/TA98%20Tree/Entity%20TA98%20EN/09.5.03.002%20Entity%20TA98%20EN.htm|title=membrana perinei|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unifr.ch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact structure description is controversial. Despite the controversy, MRI imaging studies support the existence of the structure.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;&lt;ref name = snell/&gt;

Superficial and inferior muscles of the perineum (urogenital diaphragm):
* ischiocavernosus 
* bulbocavernosus 
* superficial transverse perinei 
The perineum attaches across the gap between the inferior pubic rami bilaterally and the perineal body. This grouping of muscles constricts to close the urogenital openings. The perineum supports and functions as a sphincter at the opening of the vagina. Other structures exist below the perineum that support the anus.&lt;ref name="herschorn" /&gt;&lt;ref name = snell/&gt;

==Perineal body==
[[File:Bulbospongiosus-Female.png|thumb|The bulbospongiosus muscle is highlighted in red.]]

The perineal body is a pyramidal structure of muscle and connective tissue and part of it is located between the anus and vagina. It is a tendon that is formed at the point where the [[bulbospongiosus muscle]], [[Transverse perineal muscles|superficial transverse perineal muscle]],&lt;ref&gt;Also known as transversus perinaei superficialis.&lt;/ref&gt; and external anal sphincter muscle converge to form this major supportive structure of the pelvis and vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarton|first=Julie|title=Assessment of the Pelvic Floor Muscles in Women with Sexual Pain|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1743609515327594|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=7|issue=11|pages=3526–3529|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02059.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imaios.com/en/e-Anatomy/Anatomical-Parts/Superficial-transverse-perineal-muscle|title=Superficial transverse perineal muscle|website=IMAIOS|language=en|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = suny1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://act.downstate.edu/courseware/haonline/labs/l41/110101.htm|title=Human Anatomy, The Female Perineum, Muscles of the Superficial Perineal Pouch|last=|first=|date=|website=act.downstate.edu|publisher=SUNY Downstate Medical Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Below this, muscles and their fascia converge and become part of the perineal body. The lower vagina is attached to the perineal body by attachments from the pubococcygeus, perineal muscles, and the [[Internal anal sphincter muscles|anal sphincter]]. The perineal body is made up of [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]], elastic [[connective tissue]] fibers, and nerve endings. Above the perineal body are the vagina and the uterus. Damage and resulting weakness of the perineal body changes the length of the vagina and predisposes it to rectocele and enterocele.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;&lt;ref name = snell&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5s7jDVQkCfoC&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Clinical Anatomy: An Illustrated Review with Questions and Explanations|last=Snell|first=Richard S.|date=2004|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=|isbn=9780781743167|location=|pages=99|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endopelvic fascia and connective tissue==
[[File:Gray236.png|thumb|250px|The internal surface of the ilium showing where the muscles supporting the vagina insert and terminate]]
The vagina is attached to the pelvic walls by endopelvic fascia. The peritoneum is the external layer of skin that covers the fascia. This tissue provides additional support to the pelvic floor. The endopelvic fascia is one continuous sheet of tissue and varies in thickness. It permits some shifting of the pelvic structures. The fascia contains elastic collagen fibers in a 'mesh-like' structure. The fascia also contains fibroblasts, smooth muscle, and vascular vessels. The cardinal ligament supports the apex of the vagina and derives some of its strength from vascular tissue. The endopelvic fascia attaches to the lateral pelvic wall via the arcus tendineus.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;

==Anterior vaginal support==
Not all agree to the amount of supportive tissue or fascia exists in the anterior vaginal wall. The major point of contention is whether the vaginal fascial layer exists. Some texts do not describe a fascial layer. Other sources state that the fascia is present under the urethra which is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt; Despite disagreement, the urethra is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;

==Lateral and mid support structures==
The midsection of the vagina is supported by its lateral attachments to the [[Tendinous arch of pelvic fascia|arcus tendineus]]. Some describe the pubocervical fascia as extending from the pubic symphysis to  the anterior vaginal wall and cervix. Anatomists do not agree on its existence.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/arcus+tendineus+fasciae+pelvis|title=Arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis|last=|first=|date=|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2018-02-03|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--"The paracolpium and parametrium are the connective tissues surrounding the vagina and the uterus, respectively. In the midvagina, the paracolpium fuses with the pelvic wall and fascia laterally.28 The cardinal ligaments (also called the transverse cervical ligaments of Mackenrodt) extend from the lateral margins of the cervix and upper vagina to the lateral pelvic walls. They originate over a large area from the region of the greater sciatic foramen over the piriformis muscles, from the pelvic bones in the region of the sacroiliac joint, and from the lateral sacrum. They are condensations of the lowermost parts of the broad ligaments. Laterally, the cardinal ligaments are continuous with the connective tissue surrounding the hypogastric vessels. Medially, they are continuous with the paracolpium and parametrium as well as the connective tissue in the anterior vaginal wall, the so-called pubocervical fascia.
The uterosacral ligaments are attached to the upper vaginal fornices posterolaterally. They extend to attach to the pre-sacral fascia in front of the sacroiliac joint. The cardinal and uterosacral ligaments hold the upper vagina in place over the levator ani muscles."&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;--&gt;

&lt;!--==Posterior support==

"The posterior vaginal wall is supported laterally by the paracolpium, which is attached to the endopelvic fascia and pelvic diaphragm. The anterior and posterior fascial layers attach or come together on the sides of the vagina. The rectovaginal fascia is thin where it attaches to the vaginal wall. Some anatomists have described attachments to the posterior vaginal by a septum, consisting of fibromuscular elastic tissue, extending from the peritoneal reflection to the perineal body. Others dispute the existence of a septum. In either case the mobility of the rectum and vagina are independent."&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;--&gt;

== Complications ==
Vaginal support structures can be damaged or weakened during childbirth or pelvic surgery. Other conditions that repeatedly strain or increase pressure in the pelvic area can also compromise support. Examples are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stratog.rcog.org.uk/tutorial/easi-resource/vaginal-and-cervical-trauma-5045|title=Vaginal and cervical trauma|website=stratog.rcog.org.uk|language=en-uk|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[constipation|chronic constipation]]
* chronic or violent coughing
* heavy lifting
* being overweight or [[Obesity|obese]]&lt;ref name="niddk"/&gt;&lt;!--"The levator plate, the shelf on which the pelvic organs rest, is horizontal when the body is in a standing position and supports the rectum and upper two thirds of the vagina above it. Weakness of the levator ani may loosen the sling behind the anorectum and cause the levator plate to sag, opening the urogenital hiatus and allowing pelvic organ prolapse.
The urogenital diaphragm closes the levator hiatus, supports and has a sphincter-like effect at the distal vagina, provides structural support for the distal urethra, and contributes to continence in that it is attached to the periurethral striated muscles.
There is controversy regarding whether the anterior vaginal wall includes a suburethral fascial layer; regardless, the anterior vaginal wall provides support to the urethra by its lateral attachment to the levators and to the endopelvic fascia from the arcus tendineus of the pelvic fascia.
A combination of smooth and striated muscle, connective tissue, mucosa, and submucosa are necessary for a functional urethral sphincter, which provides watertight apposition of the urethral lumen, compression of the wall around the lumen, and a means of compensating for abdominal pressure changes.
The “hammock hypothesis” describes support of the urethra by a coordinated action of fascia and muscles, which provides a hammock onto which the urethra is compressed during increases in intra-abdominal pressure."&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;--&gt;

:''This article is about the Youth Hostels Association (England &amp; Wales), for other topics related with the abbreviation "YHA", see [[YHA (disambiguation)|YHA]]''

The '''Youth Hostels Association (England &amp; Wales)''' is a charitable organisation, registered with the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]], providing [[Hostel|youth hostel]] accommodation in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. It is a member of the [[Hostelling International]] federation.

==History==
[[File:YHA Salisbury.JPG|thumb|Youth Hostel in Salisbury, Wiltshire]]
[[File:Number of YHA hostels.png|thumb|Number of hostels operated by the YHA, 1930 - 2010]]

===Formation===
The concept of [[Hostel|youth hostels]] originated in Germany in 1909 with [[Richard Schirrmann]] and it took 20 years for the ideas to reach fruition in the United Kingdom.  In 1929/30, several groups almost simultaneously formed to investigate establishing youth hostels in the UK.  Foremost among these was the Merseyside Centre of the British Youth Hostels Association.  On 10 April 1930, representatives of these bodies met and agreed to form the British Youth Hostels Association.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coburn1950|Coburn]] p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly afterwards, it became the Youth Hostels Association (England &amp; Wales), with separate associations for Scotland ([[Scottish Youth Hostels Association]]) and Northern Ireland ([[Hostelling International Northern Ireland]]).  Ever since its inception, it has been known as "YHA", using the abbreviation YHA (E&amp;W) when necessary to distinguish it from other associations.

YHA's charitable objective is stated as:&lt;blockquote&gt;
To help all, especially young people of limited means, to a greater knowledge, love and care of the countryside, particularly by providing hostels or other simple accommodation for them in their travels, and thus to promote their health, rest and education.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early years===
The first [[hostel]] to open was at Pennant Hall near [[Llanrwst]] in North Wales.  Opened in December 1930, it closed in 1931 due to problems with the water supply.  The water came from a nearby brook but this was contaminated by sewage from the farm next door.  As was commented at the time:- 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[the farmer] saw no sin in mixing manure with drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coburn1950|Coburn]] p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

1931 saw the first widespread opening of hostels and, by the end of 1931, 75 hostels had opened, although at the end of the year 15 closed their doors not to reopen.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neal1993|Neal &amp; Neal]]&lt;/ref&gt; The price of an overnight stay was 1/- (1 [[shilling]]) in every case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=YHA Handbook, 4th edition 1931|publisher=YHA|location=Welwyn Garden City|year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Annual membership was 5/- for Seniors and 2/6 for Juniors.  Life membership was available for 3 [[guineas]] (£3 3s).  Of the hostels opened in 1931, two remain open, [[Idwal Cottage]] and [[Street, Somerset|Street]].

All hostels provided accommodation in single sex dormitories, usually with bunk beds. Most hostels had accommodation for both sexes, but in a few towns e.g. Southampton, separate hostels were provided for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=YHA Handbook 1939|publisher=YHA|location=Welwyn Garden City|year=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-catering facilities were provided at all hostels and many hostels provided a meals service.

Each hostel was run by a manager known as a warden and all the hostels in an area were administered by a number of Regional Councils.  Initially, there were 14 Regional Councils, but the number grew to 19 by the end of 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MauriceJones2008|Maurice-Jones &amp; Porter]] p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  A National Office to co-ordinate policy and standards was established in [[Welwyn Garden City]].

Membership was required to stay at a hostel and everyone staying was required to assist in the running of the hostel by undertaking what were known as 'duties'.  These ranged from washing up to cleaning the hostel and, in hostels with no water supply on site, replenishing the water supply.

Blankets and pillows were supplied. A sheet sleeping bag was used from the outset and could be hired for a small charge, but most members chose to provide their own, carrying it with them from hostel to hostel.

The emphasis was very much on a communal atmosphere within each hostel.  The use of dormitory accommodation and common rooms in every hostel reinforced this.  Also the shared interests, mostly walking and cycling, of those using the hostels contributed to this spirit.

From this rough and ready beginning, the organisation grew and grew so that, by the outbreak of [[World War II]], there were 297 hostels and 83,000 members, with 600,000 overnight stays being recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coburn1950|Coburn]] p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

It did not take long for the fledgling organisation to obtain royal approval and in 1932 the then Prince of Wales (later [[Edward VIII]]) opened Derwent Hall hostel in Derbyshire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MauriceJones2008|Maurice-Jones &amp; Porter]] p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  With its panelled walls, it became a flagship hostel for the Association.

===Wartime reduction===
The war had a significant effect on YHA.  Membership levels in 1940 and 1941 slumped as men and women joined the armed services and leisure travel was discouraged.  The number of hostels open decreased, with up to a third being closed for the duration due to their location in militarily sensitive areas.  The low point was 1941, when only 170 hostels remained open&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coburn1950|Coburn]] p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; and overnight stays were reduced accordingly.  It wasn't only the war that led to the closure of hostels; among the hostels that closed for good was Derwent Hall, flooded as a result of the Derwent Water Board project and the creation of [[Ladybower Reservoir]].

From the low of 1941, things began to recover, so that by war's end over 200 hostels were open and membership was back to pre-war levels.  This increase in the latter part of the war was partly due to government encouragement for factory workers to take short breaks away from the cities.

===Post war recovery===
With peace, the resurgence of YHA continued until, in 1950, the peak number of hostels open was reached, with 303 open in that year.&lt;ref name="AR1999"&gt;{{cite book|title=YHA Annual Report 1998/9|publisher=YHA|location=St Albans|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership continued to grow and passed the 200,000 mark in 1950.&lt;ref name="AR1999"/&gt; Overnight stays grew from 1.1 million in 1950 to 1.45 million in 1970.&lt;ref name="Short History"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Short History of the YHA|publisher=YHA|location=St Albans|year=1969|isbn=978-0-900833-02-1|oclc=71021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the National Office moved from Welwyn Garden City to [[St Albans]], where it remained until 2002 when a further move was made to [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]].  The buildings in St Albans and Matlock were both called Trevelyan House in honour of the first president of YHA, Dr [[G. M. Trevelyan]].

In 1964, the number of regions was reduced to ten and financial changes made to make it easier for each region to manage its own affairs.&lt;ref name="Short History"/&gt;

===Reform===
Significant modernisation of hostels had occurred during the 1970s, but by the early 1980s it became clear to YHA that it needed to change, as the stresses and strains of running what was a large organisation began to show on what was almost entirely a volunteer-run body.  Direct management of the hostels was removed from the regional committees and a professional management structure was put in place.&lt;ref name="YHA History"&gt;
{{cite web
|title = YHA History
|url=http://www.yha.org.uk/about-yha/corporate-information/history_of_the_yha.aspx
|accessdate=17 March 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The regional committees were themselves reformed into four regional councils; North, Central, South and Wales.

With a new management, YHA continued to thrive and by 2000 overnight stays had reached a new peak of over 2,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=YHA Strategic Plan 2008&amp;ndash;2013|publisher=YHA|location=Matlock|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting changes in the needs of young travellers, much effort was put into meeting a desire for less spartan facilities in hostels e.g. smaller rooms, more showers, abolishing washrooms.&lt;ref name="YHA History"/&gt;

As well as upgrading facilities in existing hostels, other experimental approaches to attracting young travellers were made.  In 2000, a series of summer-only hostels utilising university student accommodation were opened in locations near airports e.g. Luton, Leeds.  The experiment wasn't repeated in following years.

A much more successful innovation was the introduction of the RentaHostel scheme.  Under this scheme, groups could hire whole hostels for their own use and without normal hostel rules applying.  Rentahostel was available during the winter months to improve usage of hostels that were otherwise closed or doing very little business.  The scheme continues to run to the present day but is now known as Exclusive Hire.&lt;ref name="YHA Exclusive Hire"&gt;

===Foot-and-mouth disease crises – 2001===
The [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth disease crisis]] hit YHA hard.  An estimated £5,000,000 of income was lost&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some hostels, such as Baldersdale, were totally inaccessible as they were within quarantine zones.  This left YHA in a serious financial crisis and severe measures needed to be taken.  The board of trustees agreed to sell 10 hostels at the end of 2002,&lt;ref&gt;

Internal and local pressure saved Dufton and Holmbury St Mary from closure and Thurlby was sold to [[Lincolnshire County Council]] who rented it back to YHA to continue as a hostel.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-first century===
The YHA charitable object has changed over the years, most recently in 2005 when the objective was changed to:
″To help all, especially young people of limited means, to a greater knowledge, love and care of the countryside, and appreciation of the cultural values of towns and cities, particularly by providing youth hostels or other accommodation for them in their travels, and thus to promote their health, recreation and education.″

YHA has been investing in its youth hostels.  Investment is funded largely from turnover and from the sale of property.  Donations, legacies and funds from other organisations and agencies also contribute.  Since 2006, YHA has invested £48.5-million and opened six new youth hostels: Whitby, North Yorkshire; National Forest, Derbyshire; Berwick-on-Tweed, Northumberland; Castleton, Derbyshire; on the South Downs near Southease in East Sussex, and in London.&lt;ref&gt;Annual reports&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, YHA announced the largest plan of network renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|title=Network renewal gets green light 
|url=http://www.yha.org.uk/Join_YHA/YHA_Updates/Network_renewal_gets_green_light.html
|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060210131805/http://www.yha.org.uk/Join_YHA/YHA_Updates/Network_renewal_gets_green_light.html
|archivedate=10 February 2006
|accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  YHA regularly monitors all its hostels to establish if they are still viable and if necessary closes those that are no longer viable or have no prospects of becoming viable again in the future.&lt;ref&gt;A full list of all hostel openings and closing since 1931 is at [[List of past and present youth hostels in England and Wales]]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the network renewal project was on top of this regular review and was a proposal to close and dispose of 32 hostels when it was announced.  The aim of the exercise was to reduce borrowing and to provide funds for re-investment into the network.  The closures were to take place over a three-year period, over and above the 13 others disposed of in the same period.  The hostels involved were not necessarily poor performers but ones where the amount of investment required to bring them up to a desired standard was excessive e.g. Steps Bridge, or in some cases because the site value was very high, e.g. Stainforth.  When the news broke, there was a storm of protest not only among the membership,&lt;ref&gt;

|title=AMs unite against hostel closure

| work=BBC News | date=26 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite the protests, YHA proceeded with the plan.  Some hostels, e.g. Liverpool, have obtained reprieves either temporary or permanent and are still open but most of the other disposals have taken place.  A number of the hostels disposed of have reopened, either as independent hostels or as Enterprise &lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Enterprise hostels are hostels that are privately owned but operated as part of the YHA under a licence agreement with YHA&lt;/ref&gt; hostels within YHA.

In 2008, as part of the move towards raising standards, YHA replaced the traditional sheet sleeping bag with a fitted bottom sheet, duvet cover and pillow cases.  From 2015, guests at most youth hostels found their beds already made for them.

In 2014, a new youth hostel opened in Brighton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/nov/22/five-of-the-best-british-youth-hostels-yha|title=Five of the best British youth hostels|first=Rachel|last=Dixon|date=22 November 2014|website=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a new youth hostel opened in Cardiff, which quickly became the only hostel in the YHA network to be awarded 5 stars by Visit Wales/Visit England. In December 2015, YHA Cardiff Central won Best Accommodation at the 2015 British Youth Travel Awards.

YHA has a network of around 140 youth hostels.  In the last ten years, YHA has sold or not renewed the leases on 86 properties.  Of these, 21 have continued to run as part of the YHA network under a licensing scheme, YHA Enterprise. The sales of those properties has netted YHA over £20-million.&lt;ref name="Accounts"&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.yha.org.uk/about-yha/corporate-information/annual_reports.aspx
|title=Annual reports
|accessdate=21 March 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, YHA continues to make a small operating loss.&lt;ref name="Accounts"/&gt;  The value of the property portfolio {{as of|February 2010|lc=y}} prices was £77.15-million.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In May 2010, YHA announced that, in a further realignment of the network and to support long term financial stability called the "Capital Strategy", two new hostels would open in 2010 and eight would close.  The two new hostels were Southease in Sussex and [[Berwick on Tweed]].  Those closed were Capel Curig (Gwynedd), Exeter (Devon), Grasmere Thorney Howe (Cumbria), Hunstanton (Norfolk), Kendal (Cumbria), River Dart (Devon), Saffron Walden (Essex), and Scarborough (North Yorkshire).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Investing in the Future |url=http://www.yha.org.uk/about-yha/press-centre/press-releases/2010-press-releases/investing_in_the_future.aspx |work= |publisher=YHA |location= |page= |pages= |language= |format= |doi= |date=11 May 2010 |month= |year= |accessdate=11 May 2010 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of 2011, Capel Curig and Grasmere had both been sold and negotiations were in progress to sell the remainder (with the exception of Exeter - now expected to close at the end of Summer 2011).  On 8 February 2011, a further update to the "Capital Strategy" was announced that will see £4-million invested in the hostels at Black Sail (Lake District), Woody's Top (Lincolnshire), Wilderhope (Shropshire), Rowen (Snowdonia), Grinton Lodge (North Yorkshire), Salcombe (Devon), Poppit Sands (Pembrokeshire), Tintagel (Cornwall) and Wells-next-the-Sea (Norfolk).  At the same time, the closure of a further nine hostels was announced, with the intention to begin the sales at the end of Summer 2011.  The hostels to close are [[Barrow House, Cumbria|Derwentwater]], Helvellyn, Hawkshead (all Lake District), Osmotherley (North Yorkshire), Salisbury (Wiltshire), Arundel (Sussex), Totland Bay (Isle of Wight) and YHA Newcastle (Northumberland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YHA’s Capital Strategy|url=http://www.yha.org.uk/about-yha/press-centre/press-releases/2011-press-releases/yha-capital-strategy.aspx|publisher=YHA|accessdate=9 February 2011|date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handbook===
In the first years of YHA (1931&amp;ndash;1934), due to the rapid change in the number of hostels available, the handbook was issued more than once each year.  From 1935, the pattern settled into an annual publication issued to all members.  In 2003, this became a biennial publication.  One was due for the period 2009&amp;ndash;10 but has been delayed. Instead, a slimmer update booklet containing less information than in previous years has been issued.  Since 2007, YHA has no longer produced an annual guidebook and relies on its website to show hostel information.

===YHA magazines===
''The Rucksack'' was YHA's first magazine.  First issued in 1932, it ran until 1956 when it was retitled ''The Youth Hosteller'', although issue numbers continued the same series.  Publication varied between quarterly in the early years to monthly in later years.  The contents consisted of hostel reviews, travel articles, regional and local group news, a letters column and updates to the handbook.  Publication ceased after the February 1972 issue (volume 39, no. 7, priced at five new pence, and reduced to bi-monthly appearance following December 1970), when an editorial explained that the magazine was to be "transmogrified".

The successor to ''The Youth Hosteller'', ''Hostelling News'' ran from Spring 1972 until Summer 1985 (issue no. 54).  A quarterly newspaper-style publication, free to members, it followed in much the same vein as its predecessors.  ''Hostelling News'' was replaced in Autumn 1985 by ''YHA Magazine'', a colour magazine in A4 format, which was rebranded as ''YHA Triangle'' in Summer 1989 (issue no. 15) and which thereafter continued as a quarterly publication until Autumn 1994 (issue no 31).  From Spring/Summer 1995 (issue no 32), it became a biannual publication, continuing until the Autumn/Winter issue of 2006 (being the fifty-fifth issue, although no longer officially numbered as such).  Following a further rebranding exercise, ''Triangle'' was replaced by the smaller format ''Discover'' but this only lasted for three issues (Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter 2007, and Spring/Summer 2008) before publication was put into abeyance.

In Spring 2009, a shorter eight-page A4 colour publication ''YHA Life'' appeared (an undated four-page pilot version, with a focus on fundraising, was issued in 2008).

''YHA News'' appeared between 1992 and 2005.  Unlike all the other publications after Spring  1972, which had been made available to all members, YHA News was only available by subscription.  Its contents were much more aimed at those involved more actively with YHA.  The opinions expressed were not necessarily those of YHA.

YHA has produced a monthly e-newsletter "The Wanderer" since 2013.

Over the years, there have been many regional handbooks produced showcasing hostels in a particular region.

===''YHA Songbook''===
The ''YHA Songbook'' was first published in 1952.  Common room sing-songs were popular and the songbook was published by YHA as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Many a common room sing-song has been marred because few of the hostelers know more than the first verses of the songs, and all too frequently the item that begins as a rousing chorus ends as a faltering solo.  A few keen singers find a place in  their rucksack or saddle-bag for a song book, but if as a result some half-dozen song books are available, it is usually found that they are all different and even the songs that are in common to several appear in differing versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=YHA Songbook|publisher=YHA|location=St Albans}} preface&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The songbook only contained the lyrics, not the music, the assumption being that someone would know the tune.

===YHA shops===
YHA had from the beginning sold items directly necessary for using hostels, e.g. sheet sleeping bags, but in 1950 started selling goods for walkers, e.g. rucksacks, by mail order from National Office.  By 1953, not only was an annual sales catalogue issued but YHA had opened a shop at 21 Bedford Street, London.  Three years later, the shop moved across the [[Strand, London|Strand]] to John Adam Street.  Over the years, this shop expanded into a Travel and Information Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=YHA Handbook 1975|publisher=YHA|location=Matlock|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other shops opened in major cities.  In 1990, the store management bought the stores from YHA&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.sap.com/uk/solutions/smb/customers/retail/yha.epx 
|title=YHA Adventure Shops

==Attitudes==

===Motor vehicles===
From the earliest days, YHA made it clear that motorists were not welcome.  Regulation 4 as printed in the handbook read:-
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hostels are intended for Members when walking or cycling, and are not open to motorists or motor-cyclists (unless they are using the hostel for the purpose of walking or climbing.  In any case motor-cars and motor-cycles must not be garaged at a hostel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=YHA Handbook of Hostels 1935|publisher=YHA|location=Welwyn Garden City|year=1934}} p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Instead great emphasis in the handbook was placed on the availability of public transport with distances to nearest railway stations being given and the availability of bus services (something that continues to this day).

In 1951 this point was promoted to regulation 1:- 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Youth Hostels are for the use of members who travel on foot, by bicycle, or canoe; they are not for members touring by motor car, motor cycle, or any power-assisted vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=YHA Handbook 1951|publisher=YHA|location=St Albans|year=1950}} p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the mid 1960s, with the decline in rail services YHA allowed members to use cars to reach a hostel, but not to motor tour.  It remained policy that cars could not be parked at hostels. From 1970 it was decided to allow parking, for a fee, at certain hostels.  However hostel wardens had a discretion to require people arriving by car to move on if the hostel was busy. In 1984 car parking charges were abolished, and parking allowed at all hostels, subject to space.

===Membership===
Until 2005 it was a requirement to be either a member of YHA or a member of an Hostelling International affiliated association before staying at a hostel.  YHA relaxed this rule partly due to a desire to make hostels more accessible to all and partly due to advice received from the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]] that the charitable status of the association was at risk if it remained a membership only organisation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Membership can be purchased on arrival at a hostel. Non-members have been able to stay since 2005; it was originally stated that this was "by paying a £3 supplement to the normal overnight price ... – equivalent to a day rate for membership".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.yha.org.uk/about-yha/open-to-all/index.aspx |title=YHA Open to all |accessdate=26 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204154308/http://www.yha.org.uk/about-yha/open-to-all/index.aspx |archivedate=4 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later amended to the form of a standard price for everyone, with a £3 per night discount for members on booking directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yha.org.uk/membership|title=YHA Membership - Sign up and save!|author=|date=|website=www.yha.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===
Until the 1980s consumption of alcohol was not allowed; drinking at the hostel could lead to offenders being banned from the hostel. The ban was initially lifted only for alcohol purchased at hostels with a table licence such as Edale, but later it was permitted to bring and drink beer, cider and wine (not spirits), but only accompanying a meal.

With the reform of UK [[Licensing Act 2003|licensing laws]] the responsibility for the behaviour of customers falls onto the personal licence holder i.e. the hostel manager.  Citing the risk of prosecution of its staff, YHA introduced a policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.yha.org.uk/about-yha/yha-news/changes_to_bring_your_own.aspx
|title=Changes to bring your own
|accessdate=21 March 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby only alcohol purchased at the hostel was permitted to be consumed on the premises.  For hostels not licensed for the sale of alcohol, the previous policy on bring-your-own continues.

The majority of youth hostels have been licensed to sell alcohol since 2010 and some have a bar.&lt;ref&gt;YHA website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools===
Pre war, groups of children aged 11&amp;ndash;18 were welcome at hostels as long as they were under the supervision of a responsible leader.  All bookings had to be made in advance.  Apart from price no other concession was made to these groups.  They were still expected to move on from hostel to hostel and for this reason this type of business became known as School Journey Parties (SJP).

After the war YHA realised the potential of providing not just accommodation to school parties and youth groups but educational facilities as well.  This scheme Youth Hostels for Health and Education, started in 1953&lt;ref name="YHA History"/&gt; and was the forerunner of the services offered today. In 2008, 27% of overnight stays with YHA were as part of organised school trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=YHA Annual Review 2008|publisher=YHA|location=Matlock|year=2008|url=http://www.yha.org.uk/Images/Annual%20Review%202008_low%20res_tcm8-10654.pdf}} p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

YHA provides financial support via its bursary scheme, Breaks for Kids, for groups of young people to take part in educational or recreational visits.  In 2013 YHA awarded grants totalling £238,000, providing 5,754 funded trips for young people.&lt;ref&gt;news release&lt;/ref&gt;
