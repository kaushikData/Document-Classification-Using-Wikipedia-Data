'''Alexander Markowich Ostrowski''' ({{lang-uk|Олександр Маркович Островський}}; {{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Ма́ркович Остро́вский}}; 25 September 1893, in [[Kiev]], [[Russian Empire]] &amp;ndash; 20 November 1986, in [[Montagnola]], [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]]) was a mathematician.

His father Mark having been a merchant, Alexander Ostrowski attended the Kiev College of Commerce, not a high school, and thus had an insufficient qualification to be admitted to university. However, his talent did not remain undetected: Ostrowski's mentor,  [[Dmitry Aleksandrovich Grave|Dmitry Grave]], wrote to [[Edmund Landau|Landau]] and [[Kurt Hensel|Hensel]] for help.

Subsequently, Ostrowski began to study mathematics at [[Marburg University]] under [[Kurt Hensel|Hensel]]'s supervision in 1912. During the [[World War I]] he was interned, but thanks to the intervention of Hensel, the restrictions on his movements were eased somewhat, and he was allowed to use the university library.

After the war had ended Ostrowski moved to [[Göttingen]] where he wrote his doctoral dissertation and was influenced by [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein|Klein]] and Landau. In 1920, after having obtained his doctorate, Ostrowski moved to [[Hamburg]] where he worked as [[Erich Hecke|Hecke]]'s assistant and finished his [[habilitation]] in 1922. In 1923 he returned to Göttingen, and in 1928 became Professor of Mathematics at [[Basel]], until retirement in 1958. In 1950 Ostrowski obtained Swiss citizenship. After retirement he still published scientific papers until his late eighties.

==Existence==
Amorphous sets cannot exist if the [[axiom of choice]] is assumed.  [[Abraham Fraenkel|Fraenkel]] constructed a permutation model of [[Urelement#Urelements in set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel with Atoms]] in which the set of atoms is an amorphous set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The axiom of choice |last=Jech |first=Thomas J. |date=2008 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=0486318257 |location=Mineola, N.Y. |oclc=761390829}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Cohen's initial work on forcing in 1963, proofs of the consistency of amorphous sets with [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel]] were obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Plotkin|first=Jacob Manuel |date=November 1969|title=Generic Embeddings |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/article/generic-embeddings/BEC36DA66935B30C082FDFB08F31D8D3 |journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic |language=en |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=388–394 |doi=10.2307/2270904 |issn=0022-4812 |mr=252211|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional properties==
Every amorphous set is [[Dedekind-infinite set|Dedekind-finite]], meaning that it has no [[bijection]] to a proper subset of itself. To see this, suppose that ''S'' is a set that does have a bijection ''f'' to a proper subset. For each ''i''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0
define ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to be the set of elements that belong to the image of the ''i''-fold [[Iterated function|composition of ''f'' with itself]] but not to the image of the (''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-fold composition.
Then each ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is non-empty, so the union of the sets ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with even indices would be an infinite set whose complement is also infinite, showing that ''S'' cannot be amorphous. However, the converse is not necessarily true: it is consistent for there to exist Dedekind-finite sets that are not amorphous.&lt;ref name="levy"&gt;{{citation|last=Lévy|first=A.|title=The independence of various definitions of finiteness|url=http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm46/fm4611.pdf|year=1958|author-link=Azriel Lévy|journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae|volume=46|pages=1–13|mr=0098671}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

No amorphous set can be [[linear ordering|linearly ordered]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | issue = 3

 | mr = 0469760

In particular this is the combination of the implications Ia&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;II&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; which de la Cruz et al. credit respectively to {{harvtxt|Lévy|1958}} and {{harvtxt|Truss|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the image of an amorphous set is itself either amorphous or finite, it follows that every function from an amorphous set to a linearly ordered set has only a finite image.

The [[cofinite filter]] on an amorphous set is an [[ultrafilter]]. This is because the complement of each infinite subset must not be infinite, so every subset is either finite or cofinite.

==Variations==
If π is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of an amorphous set into finite subsets, then there must be exactly one integer ''n''(π) such that π has infinitely many subsets of size ''n''; for, if every size was used finitely many times, or if more than one size was used infinitely many times, this information could be used to coarsen the partition and split π into two infinite subsets. If an amorphous set has the additional property that, for every partition π, ''n''(π)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, then it is called '''strictly amorphous''' or '''strongly amorphous''', and if there is a finite upper bound on ''n''(π) then the set is called '''bounded amorphous'''. It is consistent with ZF that amorphous sets exist and are all bounded, or that they exist and are all unbounded.&lt;ref name="truss"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], the '''arithmetic mean''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˌ|æ|r|ɪ|θ|ˈ|m|ɛ|t|ɪ|k|_|ˈ|m|iː|n}}, stress on third syllable of "arithmetic"), or simply the [[mean]] or '''average''' when the context is clear, is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jacobs | first = Harold R. | title = Mathematics: A Human Endeavor | edition = Third | year = 1994 | publisher = [[W. H. Freeman]] | page = 547 | isbn = 0-7167-2426-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is often a set of results of an [[experiment]] or an [[observational study]], or frequently a set of results from a [[Survey (statistics)|survey]]. The term "arithmetic mean" is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other [[average|mean]]s, such as the [[geometric mean]] and the [[harmonic mean]]. 

In addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is used frequently in many diverse fields such as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[history]], and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent. For example, [[per capita income]] is the arithmetic average income of a nation's population.

While the arithmetic mean is often used to report [[central tendency|central tendencies]], it is not a [[robust statistic]], meaning that it is greatly influenced by [[outlier]]s (values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values). Notably, for [[skewed distribution]]s, such as the [[distribution of income]] for which a few people's incomes are substantially greater than most people's, the arithmetic mean may not coincide with one's notion of "middle", and robust statistics, such as the [[median]], may be a better description of central tendency.

==Definition==
The '''arithmetic mean''' (or '''mean''' or '''average'''), &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; (read &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''bar''), is the mean of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; values &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;{{cite book| last = Medhi| first = Jyotiprasad| title = Statistical Methods: An Introductory Text| url = https://books.google.com/?id=bRUwgf_q5RsC| year = 1992| publisher = New Age International| isbn = 9788122404197| pages = 53–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arithmetic mean  is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency in a [[data set]]. In statistics, the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency. The arithmetic mean of a set of observed data is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations. Symbolically, if we have a data set consisting of the values &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n&lt;/math&gt;, then the arithmetic mean &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;A=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n a_i=\frac{a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

(See [[summation]] for an explanation of the [[summation operator]]).

For example, let us consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of a firm: 2500, 2700, 2400, 2300, 2550, 2650, 2750, 2450, 2600, 2400. The arithmetic mean is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{ 2500+ 2700+ 2400+ 2300+ 2550+ 2650+ 2750+ 2450+ 2600+ 2400}{10}=2530.&lt;/math&gt;

If the data set is a [[statistical population]] (i.e., consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them), then the mean of that population is called the '''population mean'''. If the data set is a [[sampling (statistics)|statistical sample]] (a subset of the population), we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a '''sample mean'''.

==Motivating properties==

The arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful, especially as a measure of central tendency. These include:

* If numbers &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dotsc,x_n&lt;/math&gt; have mean &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(x_1-\bar{x}) + \dotsb + (x_n-\bar{x}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;x_i-\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from a given number to the mean, one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean. The mean is the only single number for which the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] (deviations from the estimate) sum to zero.
* If it is required to use a single number as a "typical" value for a set of known numbers &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dotsc,x_n&lt;/math&gt;, then the arithmetic mean of the numbers does this best, in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the typical value: the sum of &lt;math&gt;(x_i-\bar{x})^2&lt;/math&gt;. (It follows that the sample mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest [[root mean squared error]].)&lt;ref name="JM"/&gt; If the arithmetic mean of a population of numbers is desired, then the estimate of it that is [[unbiased estimate|unbiased]] is the arithmetic mean of a sample drawn from the population.

==Contrast with median==

The arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median. The median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger than, and no more than half are smaller than, the median. If elements in the data [[arithmetic progression|increase arithmetically]], when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal. For example, consider the data sample &lt;math&gt;{1,2,3,4}&lt;/math&gt;. The average is &lt;math&gt;2.5&lt;/math&gt;, as is the median. However, when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically, such as &lt;math&gt;{1,2,4,8,16}&lt;/math&gt;, the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly. In this case, the arithmetic average is 6.2 and the median is 4. In general, the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample, and can be larger or smaller than most of them.

There are applications of this phenomenon in many fields. For example, since the 1980s, the median income in the United States has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Paul |last=Krugman |url=http://prospect.org/article/rich-right-and-facts-deconstructing-inequality-debate |title=The Rich, the Right, and the Facts: Deconstructing the Income Distribution Debate |work=The American Prospect |date=June 4, 2014 |orig-year=Fall 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==

===Weighted average===
{{main|Weighted average}}
A weighted average, or weighted mean, is an average in which some data points count more heavily than others, in that they are given more weight in the calculation. For example, the arithmetic mean of &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{(3+5)}{2} = 4&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3\right) + \left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 5\right) = 4&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, a ''weighted'' mean in which the first number receives, for example, twice as much weight as the second (perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled) would be calculated as &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{2}{3} \cdot 3\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} \cdot 5\right) = \frac{11}{3}&lt;/math&gt;. Here the weights, which necessarily sum to the value one, are &lt;math&gt;(2/3)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(1/3)&lt;/math&gt;, the former being twice the latter. Note that the arithmetic mean (sometimes called the "unweighted average" or "equally weighted average") can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other (equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; in the above example, and equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; in a situation with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; numbers being averaged).

===Continuous probability distributions===

[[File:Comparison mean median mode.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of two [[log-normal distribution]]s with equal mean but different [[skewness]], resulting in different [[median]]s and [[mode (statistics)|mode]]s.]]

If a numerical property, and any sample of data from it, could take on any value from a continuous range, instead of, for example, just integers, then the [[probability]] of a number falling into some range of possible values can be described by integrating a [[continuous probability distribution]] across this range, even when the naive probability for a sample number taking one certain value from infinitely many is zero. The analog of a weighted average in this context, in which there are an infinite number of possibilities for the precise value of the variable in each range, is called the ''mean of the probability distribution''. A most widely encountered probability distribution is called the [[normal distribution]]; it has the property that all measures of its central tendency, including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the [[Mode (statistics)|mode]] (the three&amp;nbsp;M's{{cn|date=October 2018}}), are equal to each other. This equality does not hold for other probability distributions, as illustrated for the [[lognormal distribution]] here.

==Angles==
{{Main|Mean of circular quantities}}

Particular care must be taken when using cyclic data, such as phases or [[angle]]s. Naïvely taking the arithmetic mean of 1° and 359° yields a result of 180°.
This is incorrect for two reasons:
* Firstly, angle measurements are only defined up to an additive constant of [[degree (angle)|360°]] (or 2π, if measuring in [[radian]]s). Thus one could as easily call these 1° and −1°, or 361° and 719°, each of which gives a different average.
* Secondly, in this situation, 0° (equivalently, 360°) is geometrically a better ''average'' value: there is lower [[statistical dispersion|dispersion]] about it (the points are both 1° from it, and 179° from 180°, the putative average).

In general application, such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range. A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation ([[viz.]], define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i.e., the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1° and 359° is 2°, not 358°).

== Symbols and encoding ==
The arithmetic mean is often denoted by a bar, for example as in &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; (read &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''bar'').&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;{{cite book| last = Medhi| first = Jyotiprasad| title = Statistical Methods: An Introductory Text| url = https://books.google.com/?id=bRUwgf_q5RsC| year = 1992| publisher = New Age International| isbn = 9788122404197| pages = 53–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some software ([[Text processing|text processors]], [[Web browser|web browsers]]) may not display the x̄ symbol properly. For example, the x̄ symbol in [[HTML]] is actually a combination of two codes - the base letter x plus a code for the line above (&amp;#772: or ¯).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/ejp10/psu/gotunicode/statsym.html|title=Notes on Unicode for Stat Symbols|website=www.personal.psu.edu|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some texts, such as [[PDF|pdfs]], the x̄ symbol may be replaced by a [[Euro coins|cent]] (¢) symbol ([[Unicode]] &amp;#162) when copied to text processor such as [[Microsoft Word]].

The original paper has recently been reprinted with a set of commentary articles.

all trees on 2,3,4 labeled vertices: &lt;math&gt;2^{2-2}=1&lt;/math&gt; tree with 2 vertices,
&lt;math&gt;3^{3-2}=3&lt;/math&gt; trees with 3 vertices and &lt;math&gt;4^{4-2}=16&lt;/math&gt;
trees with 4 vertices.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''Cayley's formula''' is a result in [[graph theory]] named after [[Arthur Cayley]].  It states that for every positive integer ''n'', the number of [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] on ''n'' labeled [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] is &lt;math&gt;n^{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The formula equivalently counts the number of [[spanning tree]]s of a [[complete graph]] with labeled vertices
{{OEIS|id=A000272}}.

==Proof==
Many proofs of Cayley's tree formula are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 | title = [[Proofs from THE BOOK]]
 | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One classical proof of the formula uses [[Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem]], a formula for the number of spanning trees in an arbitrary graph involving the [[determinant]] of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  [[Prüfer sequence]]s yield a [[bijective proof]] of Cayley's formula. Another bijective proof, by [[André Joyal]], finds a one-to-one transformation between ''n''-node trees with two distinguished nodes and maximal directed [[pseudoforest]]s.
A proof by [[double counting (proof technique)|double counting]] due to Jim Pitman counts in two different ways the number of different sequences of directed edges that can be added to an empty graph on n vertices to form from it a rooted tree; see [[Double counting (proof technique)#Counting trees]].

== History ==
The formula was first discovered by [[Carl Wilhelm Borchardt]] in 1860, and proved via a [[determinant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Borchardt | first = C. W. | authorlink = Carl Wilhelm Borchardt |year=1860 |title=Über eine Interpolationsformel für eine Art Symmetrischer Functionen und über Deren Anwendung |journal=Math. Abh. der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a short 1889 note, Cayley extended the formula in several directions, by taking into account the degrees of the vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A.|last=Cayley|authorlink=Arthur Cayley |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7c4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA26 |title=A theorem on trees |journal=Quart. J. Pure Appl. Math |volume=23 |year=1889 |pages=376–378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he referred to Borchardt's original paper, the name "Cayley's formula" became standard in the field.

== Other properties ==

Cayley's formula immediately gives the number of labelled rooted [[Forest (graph theory)|forests]] on ''n'' vertices, namely (''n'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;.
Each labelled rooted forest can be turned into a labelled tree with one extra vertex, by adding a vertex with label ''n'' + 1 and connecting it to all roots of the trees in the forest.

There is a close connection with rooted forests and [[parking function|parking functions]], since the number of parking functions on ''n'' cars is also (''n'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;. A bijection between rooted forests and parking functions was given by [[Marcel-Paul Schützenberger|M. P. Schützenberger]] in 1968.

=== Generalizations ===

The following generalizes Cayley's formula to labelled forests:
Let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of labelled forests on ''n'' vertices,
such that vertices 1, 2, ..., ''k'' all belong to different trees.
Then {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''k'' ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − ''k'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Takács|first1=Lajos|title=On Cayley's formula for counting forests|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A|date=March 1990|volume=53|issue=2|pages=321–323|doi=10.1016/0097-3165(90)90064-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding the {{color|#c0c0c0|grey}} line would make ''b''&lt;''c'' without requiring any other changes. Conversely, ⟨''c'',''b''⟩ is not a critical pair, since ''d''&lt;''c'', but not ''d''&lt;''b''.]]
In [[order theory]], a discipline within mathematics, a '''critical pair''' is a pair of elements in a [[partially ordered set]] that are [[comparability|incomparable]] but that could be made comparable without requiring any other changes to the partial order.

Formally, let {{math|1=''P'' = (''S'', ≤)}} be a partially ordered set. Then a critical pair is an ordered pair {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} of elements of {{mvar|S}} with the following three properties:
*{{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are incomparable in {{mvar|P}},
*for every {{mvar|z}} in {{mvar|S}}, if {{math|''z'' &lt; ''x''}} then {{math|''z'' &lt; ''y''}}, and
*for every {{mvar|z}} in {{mvar|S}}, if {{math|''y'' &lt; ''z''}} then {{math|''x'' &lt; ''z''}}.

If {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} is a critical pair, then the binary relation obtained from {{mvar|P}} by adding the single relationship {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} is also a partial order. The properties required of critical pairs ensure that, when the relationship {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} is added, the addition does not cause any violations of the [[transitive property]].

A set {{mvar|R}} of [[linear extension]]s of {{mvar|P}} is said to ''reverse'' a critical pair {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} in {{mvar|P}} if there exists a linear extension in {{mvar|R}} for which {{mvar|y}} occurs earlier than&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}. This property may be used to characterize [[order dimension|realizer]]s of finite partial orders: A nonempty set {{mvar|R}} of linear extensions is a realizer if and only if it reverses every critical pair.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2883">A '''Cryptographic Module Testing Laboratory''' ('''CMTL''') is an [[information technology]] (IT) [[computer security]] testing laboratory that is accredited to conduct cryptographic module evaluations for conformance to the [[FIPS 140-2]] [[United States|U.S.]] [[United States Government|Government]] standard.

The [[NIST|National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) [[NVLAP|National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program]] (NVLAP) accredits CMTLs to meet [[CMVP|Cryptographic Module Validation Program]] (CMVP) standards and procedures.

This has been replaced by [https://csrc.nist.gov/Presentations/2002/FIPS-140-2-and-the-Cryptographic-Module-Validation FIPS 140-2 and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)].

==CMTL requirements==
These laboratories must meet the following requirements:

* NIST Handbook 150, NVLAP Procedures and General Requirements
* NIST Handbook 150-17 Information Technology Security Testing - Cryptographic Module Testing
**NVLAP Specific Operations Checklist for Cryptographic Module Testing

==FIPS 140-2 in relation to the Common Criteria==

A CMTL can also be a [[Common Criteria]] (CC) Testing Laboratory ([[Common Criteria Testing Laboratory|CCTL]]). The CC and FIPS 140-2 are different in the abstractness and focus of tests. FIPS 140-2 testing is against a defined cryptographic module and provides a suite of conformance tests to four [[FIPS 140-2#Security Levels|FIPS 140 security levels]]. FIPS 140-2 describes the requirements for cryptographic modules and includes such areas as [[physical security]], [[key management]], self tests, [[RBAC|roles]] and services, etc. The standard was initially developed in 1994 - prior to the development of the CC. The CC is an evaluation against a [[Protection Profile]] (PP), usually created by the user, or security target (ST). Typically, a PP covers a broad range of products.

* A CC evaluation does not supersede or replace a validation to either [[FIPS 140-1]] or FIPS 140-2. The four security levels in FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2 do not map directly to specific CC [[Evaluation Assurance Level|EAL]]s or to CC functional requirements. A CC certificate cannot be a substitute for a FIPS 140-1 or FIPS 140-2 certificate. 

If the operational environment is a modifiable operational environment, the operating system requirements of the Common Criteria are applicable at FIPS Security Levels 2 and above.

* FIPS 140-1 required evaluated operating systems that referenced the [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria]] (TCSEC) classes C2, B1 and B2. However, TCSEC is no longer in use and has been replaced by the Common Criteria. Consequently, FIPS 140-2 now references the Common Criteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26715">In [[combinatorial mathematics]] a '''cycle index''' is a polynomial in several variables which is structured in such a way that information about how a group of permutations acts on a set can be simply read off from the coefficients and exponents. This compact way of storing information in an algebraic form is frequently used in [[combinatorial enumeration]].

Each permutation π of a [[finite set]] of objects [[Partition of a set|partitions]] that set into [[cyclic permutation|cycle]]s; the '''cycle index monomial''' of π is a [[monomial]] in variables ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … that describes the type of this partition (the '''cycle type''' of π): the exponent of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of cycles of π of size&amp;nbsp;''i''. The '''cycle index polynomial''' of a [[permutation group]] is the average of the cycle index monomials of its elements. The phrase '''cycle indicator''' is also sometimes used in place of ''cycle index''.

Knowing the cycle index polynomial of a permutation group, one can enumerate equivalence classes due to the group's action. This is the main ingredient in the [[Pólya enumeration theorem]]. Performing formal algebraic and differential operations on these polynomials and then interpreting the results combinatorially lies at the core of [[combinatorial species|species theory]].

==Permutation groups and group actions==

Let ''X'' be a set. A [[Bijective mapping|bijective map]] from ''X'' onto itself is called a [[permutation]] and the set of all permutations of ''X'' forms a group under the composition of mappings, called the [[Symmetric group]] of ''X'', '''Sym'''(''X''). Every [[subgroup]] of Sym(''X'') is called a [[permutation group]] of ''degree'' |''X''|.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=pg. 2, section 1.2 Symmetric groups}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''G'' be an [[abstract group]] with a [[group homomorphism]],φ, from ''G'' into Sym(''X''). The image, φ(''G''), is a permutation group. The group homomorphism can be thought of as a means for permitting the group ''G'' to "act" on the set ''X'' (using the permutations associated with the elements of ''G''). Such a group homomorphism is formally called a [[group action]] and the image of the homomorphism is a ''permutation representation'' of ''G''. A given group can have many different permutation representations, corresponding to different actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|1994|loc=pp. 227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose that group ''G'' ''acts'' on set ''X'' (that is, a group action exists). In combinatorial applications the interest is in the set ''X''; for instance, counting things in ''X'' and knowing what structures might be left invariant by ''G''. Little is lost by working with permutation groups in such a setting, so in these applications, when a group is considered, it is a permutation representation of the group which will be worked with, and thus, a group action must be specified. Algebraists, on the other hand, are more interested in the groups themselves and would be more concerned with the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernels]] of the group actions, which measure how much is lost in passing from the group to its permutation representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|1994|loc=pg. 231, section 14.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disjoint cycle representation of permutations ==
Finite permutations are most often represented as group actions on the set ''X'' = {1,2, ..., n}. A permutation in this setting can be represented by a two line notation. Thus,
:: &lt;math&gt;\left ( \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 \end{matrix} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
corresponds to a [[bijection]] on ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} which sends 1 → 2, 2 → 3, 3 → 4, 4 → 5 and 5 → 1. This can be read off from the columns of the notation. When the top row is understood to be the elements of ''X'' in an appropriate order, only the second row need be written. In this one line notation, our example would be [2 3 4 5 1].&lt;ref&gt;This notational style is frequently found in the computer science literature.&lt;/ref&gt; This example is known as a ''cyclic permutation'' because it "cycles" the numbers around and a third notation for it would be (1 2 3 4 5). This ''cycle notation'' is to be read as: each element is sent to the element on its right, but the last element is sent to the first one (it "cycles" to the beginning). With cycle notation, it does not matter where a cycle starts, so (1 2 3 4 5) and (3 4 5 1 2) and (5 1 2 3 4) all represent the same permutation. The ''length of a cycle'' is the number of elements in the cycle.

Not all permutations are cyclic permutations, but every permutation can be written as a product&lt;ref&gt;Cyclic permutations are functions and the term ''product'' really means ''composition'' of these functions.&lt;/ref&gt; of disjoint (having no common element) cycles in essentially one way.&lt;ref&gt;Up to the different ways one can write a cycle and the fact that disjoint cycles commute so they can be written in any order.&lt;/ref&gt; As a permutation may have ''fixed points'' (elements that are unchanged by the permutation), these will be represented by cycles of length one. For example:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Tesman|2009|loc=pg. 473}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\left ( \begin{matrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4&amp; 5&amp; 6\\2&amp;1&amp;3&amp;5&amp;6&amp;4 \end{matrix} \right ) = (1 2)(3)(4 5 6).&lt;/math&gt;
This permutation is the product of three cycles, one of length two, one of length three and a fixed point. The elements in these cycles are disjoint subsets of ''X'' and form a [[partition of a set|partition]] of ''X''.

The cycle structure of a permutation can be coded as an algebraic monomial in several ([[Free variables and bound variables|dummy]]) variables in the following way: a variable is needed for each distinct cycle length of the cycles that appear in the cycle decomposition of the permutation. In the previous example there were three different cycle lengths, so we will use three variables, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (in general, use the variable ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to correspond to length ''k'' cycles). The variable ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; will be raised to the ''j''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') power where ''j''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') is the number of cycles of length ''i'' in the cycle decomposition of permutation ''g''. We can then associate the ''cycle index monomial''
:: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{k=1}^n a_k^{j_k(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
to the permutation ''g''. The cycle index monomial of our example would be ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, while the cycle index monomial of the permutation (1 2)(3 4)(5)(6 7 8 9)(10 11 12 13)(14)(15) would be ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The '''cycle index''' of a [[permutation group]] ''G'' is the average of the cycle index monomials of all the permutations ''g'' in ''G''.

More formally, let ''G'' be a permutation group of order ''m'' and degree ''n''.
Every permutation ''g'' in ''G'' has a unique decomposition into disjoint cycles, say
''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ... .
Let the length of a cycle ''c'' be denoted by |''c''|.

Now let ''j''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(g) be the number of cycles of ''g'' of length ''k'', where

:&lt;math&gt;0 \le j_k(g) \le \lfloor n/k \rfloor \mbox{ and }
\sum_{k=1}^n k \, j_k(g) \; = n.&lt;/math&gt;

We associate to ''g'' the monomial
:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{c\in g} a_{|c|} = \prod_{k=1}^n a_k^{j_k(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
in the variables ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Then the cycle index ''Z''(''G'') of ''G'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt; Z(G) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g\in G} \prod_{k=1}^n a_k^{j_k(g)}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==

Consider the group ''G'' of [[rotational symmetries]] of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] in the [[Euclidean plane]]. Such symmetries are completely determined by the images of just the corners of the square. By labeling these corners 1, 2, 3 and 4 (consecutively going clockwise) we can represent the elements of ''G'' as permutations of the set ''X'' = {1,2,3,4}.&lt;ref&gt;Technically we are using the notion of equivalence of group actions, replacing ''G'' acting on the corners of the square by the permutation representation of ''G'' acting on ''X''. For the purposes of exposition, it is better to slide over these details.&lt;/ref&gt; The permutation representation of ''G'' consists of the four permutations (1 4 3 2), (1 3)(2 4), (1 2 3 4) and e = (1)(2)(3)(4) which represent the counter-clockwise rotations by 90°, 180°, 270° and 360° respectively. Notice that the identity permutation e is the only permutation with fixed points in this representation of ''G''. As an abstract group, ''G'' is known as the cyclic group ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and this permutation representation of it is its ''regular representation''. The cycle index monomials are ''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; respectively. Thus, the cycle index of this permutation group is:
:: &lt;math&gt;Z(C_4) = \frac{1}{4}\left ( a_1^4 + a_2^2 + 2a_4 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The group ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; also acts on the unordered pairs of elements of ''X'' in a natural way. Any permutation ''g'' would send {''x'',''y''} → {''x''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;} (where ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt; is the image of the element ''x'' under the permutation ''g'').&lt;ref&gt;This notation is common amongst geometers and combinatorialists. It is used instead of the more common g(x) for traditional reasons.&lt;/ref&gt; The set ''X'' is now {''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'', ''F''} where ''A'' = {1,2}, ''B'' = {2,3}, ''C'' = {3,4}, ''D'' = {1,4}, ''E'' = {1,3} and ''F'' = {2,4}. These elements can be thought of as the sides and diagonals of the square or, in a completely different setting, as the edges of the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Acting on this new set, the four group elements are now represented by (''A'' ''D'' ''C'' ''B'')(''E'' ''F''), (''A C'')(''B D'')(''E'')(''F''), (''A B C D'')(''E F'') and e = (''A'')(''B'')(''C'')(''D'')(''E'')(''F'') and the cycle index of this action is:
:: &lt;math&gt;Z(C_4) = \frac{1}{4}\left ( a_1^6 + a_1^2 a_2^2 + 2a_2a_4 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The group ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can also act on the ordered pairs of elements of ''X'' in the same natural way. Any permutation ''g'' would send (''x'',''y'') → (''x''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;) (in this case we would also have ordered pairs of the form (''x'', ''x'')). The elements of ''X'' could be thought of as the arcs of the [[complete digraph]] ''D''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (with loops at each vertex). The cycle index in this case would be:
:: &lt;math&gt;Z(C_4) = \frac{1}{4}\left ( a_1^{16} + a_2^8 + 2a_4^4 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Types of actions==

As the above example shows, the cycle index depends on the group action and not on the abstract group. Since there are many permutation representations of an abstract group, it is useful to have some terminology to distinguish them.

When an abstract group is defined in terms of permutations, it is a permutation group and the group action is the identity homomorphism. This is referred to as the ''natural action''.

The symmetric group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in its natural action has the elements&lt;ref&gt;There is a convention to not write the fixed points in the cycle notation for a permutation, but these must be represented in the cycle index.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S_3 = \{e,(2 3),(1 2),(1 2 3),(1 3 2),(1 3)\}&lt;/math&gt;
and so, its cycle index is:
:: &lt;math&gt;Z(S_3) = \frac{1}{6}
\left( a_1^3 + 3 a_1 a_2 + 2 a_3 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

A permutation group ''G'' on the set ''X'' is ''transitive'' if for every pair of elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'' there is at least one ''g'' in ''G'' such that ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;. A transitive permutation group is ''regular'' (or sometimes referred to as ''sharply transitive'') if the only permutation in the group that has fixed points is the identity permutation.

A finite transitive permutation group ''G'' on the set ''X'' is regular if and only if |''G''| = |''X''|.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=pg. 9, Corollary 1.4A(iii)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cayley's theorem]] states that every abstract group has a regular permutation representation given by the group acting on itself (as a set) by (right) multiplication. This is called the ''regular representation'' of the group.

The cyclic group ''C''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in its regular representation contains the six permutations (one-line form of the permutation is given first):

:: [1 2 3 4 5 6] = (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)
:: [2 3 4 5 6 1] = (1 2 3 4 5 6)
:: [3 4 5 6 1 2] = (1 3 5)(2 4 6)
:: [4 5 6 1 2 3] = (1 4)(2 5)(3 6)
:: [5 6 1 2 3 4] = (1 5 3)(2 6 4)
:: [6 1 2 3 4 5] = (1 6 5 4 3 2).

Thus its cycle index is:
:&lt;math&gt;Z(C_6) = \frac{1}{6}
\left( a_1^6 + a_2^3 + 2 a_3^2 + 2 a_6 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Often, when an author does not wish to use the group action terminology, the permutation group involved is given a name which implies what the action is. The following three examples illustrate this point.

=== The cycle index of the ''edge permutation group'' of the complete graph on three vertices ===
We will identify the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with an [[equilateral triangle]] in the [[Euclidean plane]]. This permits us to use geometric language to describe the permutations involved as symmetries of the equilateral triangle. Every permutation in the group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of ''vertex permutations'' (''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in its natural action, given above) induces an edge permutation. These are the permutations:
* The identity: No vertices are permuted, and no edges; the contribution is &lt;math&gt;a_1^3.&lt;/math&gt;
* Three reflections in an axis passing through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite edge: These fix one edge (the one not incident on the vertex) and exchange the remaining two; the contribution is &lt;math&gt;3 a_1 a_2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Two rotations, one clockwise, the other counterclockwise: These create a cycle of three edges; the contribution is &lt;math&gt;2 a_3.&lt;/math&gt;

The cycle index of the group ''G'' of edge permutations induced by vertex permutations from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt; Z(G) = \frac{1}{6} \left(a_1^3 + 3 a_1 a_2 + 2 a_3 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

It happens that the complete graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to its own [[line graph]] (vertex-edge dual) and hence the edge permutation group induced by the vertex permutation group is the same as the vertex permutation group, namely ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the cycle index is ''Z''(''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). This is not the case for complete graphs on more than three vertices, since these have strictly more edges (&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{2}&lt;/math&gt;) than vertices (''n'').

=== The cycle index of the edge permutation group of the complete graph on four vertices ===

This is entirely analogous to the three-vertex case. These are the vertex permutations (''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in its natural action) and the edge permutations (''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; acting on unordered pairs) that they induce:

* The identity: This permutation maps all vertices (and hence, edges) to themselves and the contribution is &lt;math&gt;a_1^6.&lt;/math&gt;
* Six permutations that exchange two vertices: These permutations preserve the edge that connects the two vertices as well as the edge that connects the two vertices not exchanged. The remaining edges form two two-cycles and the contribution is &lt;math&gt;6 a_1^2 a_2^2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Eight permutations that fix one vertex and produce a three-cycle for the three vertices not fixed: These permutations create two three-cycles of edges, one containing those not incident on the vertex, and another one containing those incident on the vertex; the contribution is &lt;math&gt;8 a_3^2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Three permutations that exchange two vertex pairs at the same time: These permutations preserve the two edges that connect the two pairs. The remaining edges form two two-cycles and the contribution is &lt;math&gt;3 a_1^2 a_2^2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Six permutations that cycle the vertices in a four-cycle: These permutations create a four-cycle of edges (those that lie on the cycle) and exchange the remaining two edges; the contribution is &lt;math&gt;6 a_2 a_4.&lt;/math&gt;

We may visualize the types of permutations geometrically as [[Tetrahedral symmetry|symmetries of a regular tetrahedron]]. This yields the following description of the permutation types.
* The identity.
* Reflection in the plane that contains one edge and the midpoint of the edge opposing it.
* Rotation by 120 degrees about the axis passing through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite face.
* Rotation by 180 degrees about the axis connecting the midpoints of two opposite edges.
* Six rotoreflections by 90 degrees.

The cycle index of the edge permutation group ''G'' of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;
Z(G) = \frac{1}{24}
\left(
a_1^6 + 9 a_1^2 a_2^2 + 8 a_3^2 + 6 a_2 a_4
\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

===The cycle index of the face permutations of a cube===

[[Image:Face colored cube.png|thumb|Cube with colored faces]]
Consider an ordinary cube in three-space and its group of symmetries (automorphisms), call it ''C''. It permutes the six faces of the cube.
(We could also consider edge permutations or vertex permutations.)
There are twenty-four automorphisms.

* The identity:
:There is one such permutation and its contribution is &lt;math&gt;a_1^6.&lt;/math&gt;
* Six 90-degree face rotations:
:We rotate about the axis passing through the centers of the face and the face opposing it. This will fix the face and the face opposing it and create a four-cycle of the faces parallel to the axis of rotation. The contribution is &lt;math&gt;6 a_1^2 a_4.&lt;/math&gt;
* Three 180-degree face rotations:
:We rotate about the same axis as in the previous case, but now there is no four cycle of the faces parallel to the axis, but rather two two-cycles. The contribution is &lt;math&gt;3 a_1^2 a_2^2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Eight 120-degree vertex rotations:
:This time we rotate about the axis passing through two opposite vertices (the endpoints of a main diagonal). This creates two three-cycles of faces (the faces incident on the same vertex form a cycle). The contribution is &lt;math&gt;8 a_3^2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Six 180-degree edge rotations:
:These edge rotations rotate about the axis that passes through the midpoints of opposite edges not incident on the same face and parallel to each other and exchanges the two faces that are incident on the first edge, the two faces incident on the second edge, and the two faces that share two vertices but no edge with the two edges, i.e. there are three two-cycles and the contribution is &lt;math&gt;6 a_2^3.&lt;/math&gt;

The conclusion is that the cycle index of the group ''C'' is
:&lt;math&gt;Z(C) = \frac{1}{24}
\left(
a_1^6 + 6 a_1^2 a_4 + 3 a_1^2 a_2^2 + 8 a_3^2 + 6 a_2^3
\right)
.&lt;/math&gt;

==Cycle indices of some permutation groups==

===Identity group ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;===
This group contains one permutation that fixes every element (this must be a natural action).

:&lt;math&gt; Z(E_n) = a_1^n.&lt;/math&gt;

===Cyclic group ''C''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;===
A [[Cyclic group]], ''C''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the group of rotations of a regular ''n''-gon, that is, ''n'' elements equally spaced around a circle. This group has φ(''d'') elements of order ''d'' for each divisor ''d'' of ''n'', where φ(''d'') is the [[Euler's totient function|Euler φ-function]], giving the number of natural numbers less than ''d'' which are relatively prime to ''d''. In the regular representation of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, a permutation of order ''d'' has ''n''/''d'' cycles of length ''d'', thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pg. 464, Example 35.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Z(C_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{d|n} \varphi(d) a_d^{n/d}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Dihedral group ''D''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;===
The [[Dihedral group]] is like the [[cyclic group]], but also includes reflections. In its natural action,

:&lt;math&gt; Z(D_n) = \frac{1}{2} Z(C_n) +
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2} a_1 a_2^{(n-1)/2}, &amp; n \mbox{ odd, } \\
\frac{1}{4}
\left( a_1^2 a_2^{(n-2)/2} + a_2^{n/2} \right), &amp; n \mbox{ even.}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

===The alternating group ''A''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;===
The cycle index of the [[alternating group]] in its natural action as a permutation group is

:&lt;math&gt; Z(A_n) =
\sum_{j_1+2 j_2 + 3 j_3 + \cdots + n j_n = n}
\frac{1 + (-1)^{j_2+j_4+\cdots}}{\prod_{k=1}^n k^{j_k} j_k!} \prod_{k=1}^n a_k^{j_k}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The numerator is 2 for the even permutations, and 0 for the odd permutations. The 2 is needed because
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{|A_n|}=\frac{2}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The symmetric group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;===

The cycle index of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in its natural action is given by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt; Z(S_n) = \sum_{j_1+2 j_2 + 3 j_3 + \cdots + n j_n = n} \frac{1}{\prod_{k=1}^n k^{j_k} j_k!} \prod_{k=1}^n a_k^{j_k}&lt;/math&gt;
that can be also stated in terms of complete [[Bell polynomial]]s:
:&lt;math&gt; Z(S_n) = \frac{B_n(0!\,a_1, 1!\,a_2, \dots, (n-1)!\,a_n)}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is obtained by counting how many times a given permutation shape can occur. There are three steps: first partition the set of ''n'' labels into subsets, where there are &lt;math&gt;j_k&lt;/math&gt; subsets of size ''k''. Every such subset generates &lt;math&gt;k!/k&lt;/math&gt; cycles of length ''k''. But we do not distinguish between cycles of the same size, i.e. they are permuted by &lt;math&gt;S_{j_k}&lt;/math&gt;. This yields
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{n!}{\prod_{k=1}^n (k!)^{j_k}}
\prod_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{k!}{k} \right)^{j_k}
\prod_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{j_k!}
=
\frac{n!}{\prod_{k=1}^n k^{j_k} j_k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

There is a useful recursive formula for the cycle index of the symmetric group.
Set &lt;math&gt;Z(S_0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and consider the size ''l'' of the cycle that contains ''n'',
where &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1 \le l \le n.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
There are &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{n-1 \choose l-1}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; ways to choose the remaining &lt;math&gt;l-1&lt;/math&gt; elements of the cycle and every such choice generates
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{l!}{l}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; different cycles.

This yields the recurrence
:&lt;math&gt; Z(S_n) = \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{g\in S_n} \prod_{k=1}^n a_k^{j_k(g)}
=
\frac{1}{n!}
\sum_{l=1}^n {n-1 \choose l-1} \; \frac{l!}{l} \; a_l \; (n-l)! \; Z(S_{n-l})
&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;
Z(S_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{l=1}^n a_l \; Z(S_{n-l}).&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==

Throughout this section we will modify the notation for cycle indices slightly by explicitly including the names of the variables. Thus, for the permutation group ''G'' we will now write:
:: &lt;math&gt;Z(G) = Z(G; a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n).&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''G'' be a group acting on the set ''X''. ''G'' also induces an action on the ''k''-subsets of ''X'' and on the ''k''-tuples of distinct elements of ''X'' (see [[#Example]] for the case ''k'' = 2), for 1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n''. Let ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the number of [[orbit (group theory)|orbits]] of ''G'' in these actions respectively. By convention we set ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. We have:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|1994|loc= pg. 248, Proposition 15.3.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

a) The [[ordinary generating function]] for ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by:
:: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n f_k t^k = Z(G; 1+t, 1+t^2, \ldots, 1+t^n),&lt;/math&gt; and
b) The [[exponential generating function]] for ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by:
:: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n F_k t^k/k! = Z(G; 1+t, 1, 1, \ldots, 1).&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''G'' be a group acting on the set ''X'' and ''h'' a function from ''X'' to ''Y''. For any ''g'' in ''G'', ''h''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;) is also a function from ''X'' to ''Y''. Thus, ''G'' induces an action on the set ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; of all functions from ''X'' to ''Y''. The number of orbits of this action is Z(''G''; ''b'', ''b'', ...,''b'') where ''b'' = |''Y''|.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc= pg. 463, Theorem 35.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This result follows from the [[Burnside's lemma|orbit counting lemma]] (also known as the Not Burnside's lemma, but traditionally called Burnside's lemma) and the weighted version of the result is [[Pólya's enumeration theorem]].

The cycle index is a polynomial in several variables and the above results show that certain evaluations of this polynomial give combinatorially significant results. As polynomials they may also be formally added, subtracted, differentiated and integrated. The area of [[symbolic combinatorics]] provides combinatorial interpretations of the results of these formal operations.

The question of what the cycle structure of a random permutation looks like is an important question in the [[analysis of algorithms]]. An overview of the most important results may be found at [[random permutation statistics]].

[[File:CubeAndStel.svg|thumb|[[Alternation (geometry)|Alternation]] of the ''n''-cube yields one of two ''n''-demicubes, as in this 3-dimensional illustration of the two [[tetrahedra]] that arise as the 3-demicubes of the 3-cube.]]
In [[geometry]], '''demihypercubes''' (also called ''n-demicubes'', ''n-hemicubes'', and ''half measure polytopes'') are a class of n-[[polytopes]] constructed from [[Alternation (geometry)|alternation]] of an n-[[hypercube]], labeled as ''h&amp;gamma;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' for being ''half'' of the hypercube family, ''&amp;gamma;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. Half of the vertices are deleted and new facets are formed. The ''2n'' facets become ''2n'' '''(n-1)-demicubes''', and 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; '''(n-1)-simplex''' facets are formed in place of the deleted vertices.&lt;ref&gt;Regular and semi-regular polytopes III, p. 315-316&lt;/ref&gt;

They have been named with a ''demi-'' prefix to each [[hypercube]] name: demicube, demitesseract, etc. The demicube is identical to the regular [[tetrahedron]], and the demitesseract is identical to the regular [[16-cell]]. The [[demipenteract]] is considered ''semiregular'' for having only regular facets. Higher forms don't have all regular facets but are all [[uniform polytope]]s.

The vertices and edges of a demihypercube form two copies of the [[halved cube graph]].

== Discovery ==

[[Thorold Gosset]] described the demipenteract in his 1900 publication listing all of the regular and semiregular figures in n-dimensions above 3. He called it a ''5-ic semi-regular''. It also exists within the [[Semiregular k 21 polytope|semiregular k&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; polytope]] family.

The demihypercubes can be represented by extended [[Schläfli symbol]]s of the form h{4,3,...,3} as half the vertices of {4,3,...,3}. The [[vertex figure]]s of demihypercubes are [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] n-[[simplex]]es.

== Constructions ==

They are represented by [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]]s of three constructive forms: 
#{{CDD|node_h|2c|node_h|2c|node_h}}...{{CDD|node_h}}  (As an [[Alternation (geometry)|alternated]] [[orthotope]]) s{2&lt;sup&gt;1,1...,1&lt;/sup&gt;}
#{{CDD|node_h|4|node|3}}...{{CDD|3|node}} (As an alternated [[hypercube]]) h{4,3&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;}
#{{CDD|nodes_10ru|split2|node|3}}...{{CDD|3|node}}. (As a demihypercube) {3&lt;sup&gt;1,n-3,1&lt;/sup&gt;}

[[H.S.M. Coxeter]] also labeled the third bifurcating diagrams as '''1&lt;sub&gt;k1&lt;/sub&gt;''' representing the lengths of the 3 branches and led by the ringed branch.

An ''n-demicube'', ''n'' greater than 2, has ''n*(n-1)/2'' edges meeting at each vertex. The graphs below show less edges at each vertex due to overlapping edges in the symmetry projection.

In general, a demicube's elements can be determined from the original n-cube: (With C&lt;sub&gt;n,m&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;''-face count in [[hypercube|n-cube]] = 2&lt;sup&gt;n-m&lt;/sup&gt;*n!/(m!*(n-m)!))

* '''Edges:''' D&lt;sub&gt;n,1&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;n,2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2 n(n-1)2&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt; (All original edges lost, each square faces create a new edge)

* '''Cells:''' D&lt;sub&gt;n,3&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;n,3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;n-4&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;n,4&lt;/sub&gt; (tetrahedra from original cells plus new ones)

== Symmetry group ==

It is generated by permutations of the coordinate axes and reflections along ''pairs'' of coordinate axes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week187.html|title=week187|author=|date=|website=math.ucr.edu|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthotopic constructions ==
[[File:Rhombic disphenoid.png|thumb|The rhombic disphenoid inside of a [[cuboid]]]]

Constructions as alternated [[orthotope]]s have the same topology, but can be stretched with different lengths in ''n''-axes of symmetry.

The [[rhombic disphenoid]] is the three-dimensional example as alternated cuboid. It has three sets of edge lengths, and [[scalene triangle]] faces.

In mathematics, the '''double Fourier sphere (DFS)''' method is a simple technique that transforms a function defined on the surface of the [[sphere]] to a function defined on a rectangular domain while preserving [[periodic function|periodicity]] in both the longitude and latitude directions.

==Introduction== 
First, a function &lt;math&gt;f(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; on the sphere is written as &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; using [[spherical coordinates]], i.e.,

: &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda,\theta) = f(\cos\lambda\sin\theta,\sin\lambda\sin\theta, \cos\theta),  (\lambda,\theta)\in[-\pi,\pi]\times[0,\pi].&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda, \theta)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;-periodic in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, but not periodic in &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. The periodicity in the latitude direction has been lost. To recover it, the function is "doubled up” and a related function on &lt;math&gt;[-\pi,\pi]\times[-\pi,\pi]&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}(\lambda,\theta) = \begin{cases} 
 g(\lambda + \pi, \theta), &amp; (\lambda, \theta) \in [-\pi, 0] \times [0, \pi],\\
 h(\lambda, \theta), &amp;(\lambda, \theta) \in [0, \pi] \times [0, \pi],\\
 g(\lambda, -\theta), &amp;(\lambda, \theta) \in [0, \pi] \times [-\pi, 0],\\
 h(\lambda + \pi, -\theta), &amp; (\lambda, \theta) \in [-\pi, 0] \times [-\pi, 0],\\
 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g(\lambda, \theta) = f(\lambda- \pi, \theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(\lambda, \theta)  = f(\lambda, \theta)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \theta) \in[0, \pi] \times [0, \pi]&lt;/math&gt;. The new function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;-periodic in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, and is constant along the lines &lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pm\pi&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the poles.

The function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt; can be expanded into a double Fourier series

: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f} \approx \sum_{j=-n}^n \sum_{k=-n}^n a_{jk} e^{ij\theta}e^{ik\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
The DFS method was proposed by Merilees&lt;ref&gt;P. E. Merilees, The pseudospectral approximation applied to the shallow water equations on a sphere, Atmosphere, 11 (1973), pp. 13–20&lt;/ref&gt; and developed further by [[Steven Orszag]].&lt;ref&gt;S. A. Orszag, Fourier series on spheres, Mon. Wea. Rev., 102 (1974), pp. 56–75.&lt;/ref&gt; The DFS method has been the subject of relatively few investigations since (a notable exception is Fornberg's work),&lt;ref&gt;B. Fornberg, A pseudospectral approach for polar and spherical geometries, SIAM J. Sci. Comp, 16 (1995), pp. 1071–1081&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps due to the dominance of [[spherical harmonics]] expansions. Over the last fifteen years it has begun to be used for the computation of gravitational fields near [[black holes]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Bartnik and A.

'''Eri Jabotinsky''' ({{Lang-he|ערי ז'בוטינסקי}}, also transliterated '''''Ari''''', {{Birth date|1910|12|26}} – {{Date of death|1969|6|6}}) was a [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Zionist]] activist, [[Israel]]i politician and academic mathematician. He was the son of [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], the founder of the opposition movement within [[Zionism]] at the time, and later served in the Knesset between 1949 and 1951, as a member of the opposition [[Herut]] party of [[Menachem Begin]].  Following his break with the party, he pursued his academic career.

==Biography==
Born in [[Odessa]], the Jabotinsky family made ''[[aliyah]]'' to [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1919. Following the arrest of his father the following year, he left the country and moved to [[France]], where he attended high school in [[Paris]], and later earned a degree in electrical engineering. Between 1933 and 1935 he worked as an engineer in an aircraft factory. In 1935 he returned to Palestine, and worked as an engineer at the [[Naharayim]] power station in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]].
[[File:Zeev Jabotinsky family.jpg|thumb|250px|Eri Jabotinsky (right) with his parents in the late 1920s]]
A long-term member of Revisionism's [[Betar]] youth movement, he became one of its representative leaders in 1936, and joined its worldwide board two years later. With Betar and the party's military wing, [[Irgun]], he helped coordinate [[Aliyah Bet|illegal Jewish immigration]] into Palestine; he was temporarily arrested by the British authorities in 1940, and upon his release he moved to the [[United States]], where his father died suddenly about the same time. There, together with [[Hillel Kook]]'s 'Bergson Boys', [[Aryeh Ben-Eliezer]], [[Shmuel Merlin]] and [[Yitzhak Ben-Ami]], they founded the Emergency Committee to Save European Jewry,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/beneli.html Aryeh Ben-Eliezer] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; among others.  He briefly returned to Palestine, but was again arrested by the British and expelled for illegal activities in 1944.

Following [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israel's independence]], he returned in 1948, and was elected to the [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|first Knesset]] the following year, as a member of the [[Herut]] party's list of candidates.  On 20 February 1951 however, Jabotinsky and Hillel Kook left Herut, and sat as independents for the rest of the term, although the move was not recognised by the house committee;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/faction/eng/FactionHistoryAll_eng.asp Mergers and Splits Among Parliamentary Groups] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; this followed on-going disagreements over the party’s direction and its new leadership by [[Menachem Begin]].

After leaving the Knesset, he was awarded a PhD in mathematics in 1957 from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He also lectured on electricity theory at the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion]] between 1955 and his death in 1969.

He was the father-in-law of [[Anatoly Rubin]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3752">{{about|curvature of knots|the theorem concerning straight-line embeddings of planar graphs|Fáry's theorem}}

In the [[knot theory|mathematical theory of knots]], the '''Fary–Milnor theorem''', named after [[István Fáry]] and [[John Milnor]], states that three-dimensional [[smooth curve]]s with small [[total curvature]] must be [[unknot]]ted. The theorem was proved independently by Fáry in 1949 and Milnor in 1950. It was later shown to follow from the existence of [[quadrisecant]]s {{harv|Denne|2004}}.

==Statement of the theorem==
If ''K'' is any closed [[curve]] in [[Euclidean space]] that is sufficiently [[smooth curve|smooth]] to define the  [[Curvature#Curvature of space curves|curvature]] κ at each of its points, and if the [[total absolute curvature]] is less than or equal to 4π, then ''K'' is an [[unknot]], i.e.:
:&lt;math&gt; \text{If} \, \oint_K \! |\kappa(s)| \, \operatorname{d}s \le 4 \pi \ \text{then} \ K \ \text{is an unknot}. &lt;/math&gt;
[[File:A worn-out baseball.JPG|thumb|The seam of a [[baseball]] follows an unknotted curve with total curvature roughly 4{{pi}}. By making the curve more convoluted, unknots can be made to have arbitrarily large curvature.]]
The [[contrapositive]] tells us that if ''K'' is not an unknot, i.e. ''K'' is not [[homotopy#Isotopy|isotopic]] to the circle, then the total curvature will be strictly greater than 4π. Notice that having the total curvature less than or equal to 4{{pi}} is merely a [[sufficient condition]] for ''K'' to be an unknot; it is not a [[necessary condition]]. In other words, although all knots with total curvature less than or equal to 4π are the unknot, there exist unknots with curvature strictly greater than 4π.

==Generalizations to non-smooth curves==
For closed polygonal chains the same result holds with the integral of curvature replaced by the sum of angles between adjacent segments of the chain. By approximating arbitrary curves by polygonal chains one may extend the definition of total curvature to larger classes of curves, within which the Fary–Milnor theorem also holds ({{harvnb|Milnor|1950}}, {{harvnb|Sullivan|2008}}).

In algebra, the '''fixed-point subgroup''' &lt;math&gt;G^f&lt;/math&gt; of an automorphism ''f'' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' is the [[subgroup]] of ''G'':
:&lt;math&gt;G^f = \{ g \in G \mid f(g) = g \}.&lt;/math&gt;
More generally, if ''S'' is a set of automorphisms of ''G'' (i.e., a subset of the [[automorphism group]] of ''G''), then the set of the elements of ''G'' that are left fixed by every automorphism in ''S'' is a subgroup of ''G'', denoted by ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;.

For example, take ''G'' to be the group of invertible ''n''-by-''n'' real matrices and &lt;math&gt;f(g)=(g^T)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (called the [[Cartan involution]]). Then &lt;math&gt;G^f&lt;/math&gt; is the group &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; of ''n''-by-''n'' [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]].

To give an abstract example, let ''S'' be a subset of a group ''G''. Then each element of ''S'' can be thought of as an automorphism through conjugation. Then
:&lt;math&gt;G^S = \{ g \in G | sgs^{-1} = g \}&lt;/math&gt;;
that is, the [[centralizer]] of ''S''.

In [[artificial intelligence]], a '''fluent''' is a condition that can change over time. In [[logic]]al approaches to reasoning about actions, fluents can be represented in [[first-order logic]] by [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]]s having an argument that depends on time. For example, the condition &amp;ldquo;the box is on the table&amp;rdquo;, if it can change over time, cannot be represented by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{On}(\mathrm{box},\mathrm{table})&lt;/math&gt;; a third argument is necessary to the predicate &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{On}&lt;/math&gt; to specify the time: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{On}(\mathrm{box},\mathrm{table},t)&lt;/math&gt; means that the box is on the table at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. This representation of fluents is modified in the [[situation calculus]] by using the sequence of the past actions in place of the current time.
 
A fluent can also be represented by a function, dropping the time argument.  For example, that the box is on the table can be represented by &lt;math&gt;on(box,table)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;on&lt;/math&gt; is a function and not a predicate. In first order logic, converting predicates to functions is called [[Reification (knowledge representation)|reification]]; for this reason, fluents represented by functions are said to be reified. When using reified fluents, a separate predicate is necessary to tell when a fluent is actually true or not. For example, &lt;math&gt;HoldsAt(on(box,table),t)&lt;/math&gt; means that the box is actually on the table at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, where the predicate &lt;math&gt;HoldsAt&lt;/math&gt; is the one that tells when fluents are true. This representation of fluents is used in the [[event calculus]], in the [[fluent calculus]], and in the [[features and fluents logic]]s.
 
Some fluents can be represented as functions in a different way. For example, the position of a box can be represented by a function &lt;math&gt;on(box,t)&lt;/math&gt; whose value is the object the box is standing on at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Conditions that can be represented in this way are called ''functional fluents''. Statements about the values of such functions can be given in first order logic with equality using literals such as &lt;math&gt;on(box,t)=table&lt;/math&gt;. Some fluents are represented this way in the [[situation calculus]].

'''''Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique''''' ('''''FGA''''') is a book that collected together seminar notes of [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. It is an 
important source for his pioneering work on [[scheme theory]], which laid foundations for [[algebraic geometry]] in its modern technical developments. 
The title is a translation of the title of Weil's book ''[[Foundations of Algebraic Geometry]].''
It contained material on [[descent theory]], and existence theorems including that for the [[Hilbert scheme]]. The ''Technique de descente et théorèmes d'existence en géometrie algébrique'' is one series of seminars within ''FGA''.

Like the bulk of Grothendieck's work of the [[IHÉS]] period, duplicated notes were circulated, but the publication was not as a conventional book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16269">In [[probabilistic logic]], the '''Fréchet inequalities''', also known as the '''Boole–Fréchet inequalities''', are rules implicit in the work of [[George Boole]]&lt;ref name=boole54&gt;Boole, G. (1854). ''An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, On Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probability.'' Walton and Maberly, London. See Boole's "major" and "minor" limits of a conjunction on page 299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hailperin86&gt;Hailperin, T. (1986). ''Boole's Logic and Probability''. North-Holland, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; and explicitly derived by [[Maurice René Fréchet|Maurice Fréchet]]&lt;ref name=frechet35&gt;Fréchet, M. (1935). Généralisations du théorème des probabilités totales. ''Fundamenta Mathematicae'' '''25''': 379–387.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=frechet51&gt;Fréchet, M. (1951). Sur les tableaux de corrélation dont les marges sont données. ''Annales de l'Université de Lyon. Section A: Sciences mathématiques et astronomie'' '''9''': 53–77.&lt;/ref&gt; that govern the combination of probabilities about [[logical proposition]]s or [[Event (probability theory)|events]] logically linked together in [[logical conjunction|conjunctions]] ([[AND gate|AND]] operations) or [[logical disjunction|disjunctions]] ([[OR gate|OR]] operations) as in [[Boolean algebra|Boolean expressions]] or [[fault tree|fault]] or [[event trees]] common in [[risk assessments]], [[engineering design]] and [[artificial intelligence]].  These inequalities can be considered rules about how to bound calculations involving probabilities without assuming [[independence]] or, indeed, without making any [[stochastic dependence|dependence]] assumptions whatsoever.  The Fréchet inequalities are closely related to the [[Boole's inequality#Bonferroni inequalities|Boole–Bonferroni–Fréchet inequalities]], and to [[Copula (probability theory)#Fr.C3.A9chet.E2.80.93Hoeffding copula bounds|Fréchet bounds]].

If ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[logical proposition]]s or [[Event (probability theory)|events]], the Fréchet inequalities are

:Probability of a [[logical conjunction]] (&amp;)
::max(0, P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + ... + P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;minus; (''n'' &amp;minus; 1)) ≤ P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; ... &amp; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ min(P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)),

:Probability of a [[logical disjunction]] (∨)
::max(P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) ≤ P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ... ∨ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ min(1, P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + ... + P(''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)),

where P( ) denotes the probability of an event or proposition.  In the case where there are only two events, say ''A'' and ''B'', the inequalities reduce to

:Probability of a logical conjunction (&amp;)
::max(0, P(''A'') + P(''B'') &amp;minus; 1) ≤ P(''A'' &amp; ''B'') ≤ min(P(''A''), P(''B'')),

:Probability of a logical disjunction (∨)
::max(P(''A''), P(''B'')) ≤ P(''A'' ∨ ''B'') ≤ min(1, P(''A'') + P(''B'')).

The inequalities bound the probabilities of the two kinds of joint events given the probabilities of the individual events.  For example, if A is "has lung cancer", and B is "has mesothelioma", then A&amp;nbsp;&amp;&amp;nbsp;B is "has both lung cancer and mesothelioma", and A&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;B is "has lung cancer or mesothelioma or both diseases", and the inequalities relate the risks of these events.

Note that logical conjunctions are denoted in various ways in different fields, including AND, &amp;, ∧ and graphical [[AND gate#Symbols|AND-gates]].  Logical disjunctions are likewise denoted in various ways, including OR, |, ∨, and graphical [[OR gate#Symbols|OR-gates]].  If events are taken to be [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] rather than [[logical proposition]]s, the [[set theory|set-theoretic]] versions of the Fréchet inequalities are

:Probability of an [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of events
::max(0,P(''A'') + P(''B'') &amp;minus; 1) ≤ P(''A'' ∩ ''B'') ≤ min(P(''A''), P(''B'')),

:Probability of a [[union (set theory)|union]] of events
::max(P(''A''), P(''B'')) ≤ P(''A'' ∪&lt;!--the cup ∪ is perversely smaller than the cap ∩, so we might use the capital letter U but it looks much worse in print outs--&gt; ''B'') ≤ min(1, P(''A'') + P(''B'')).

==Numerical examples==
If the probability of an event A is P(A) = ''a'' = 0.7, and the probability of the event B is P(B) = ''b'' = 0.8, then the probability of the [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]. i.e., the joint event A &amp; B, is surely in the interval
: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;P(A &amp; B) &amp;isin; [max(0, ''a'' + ''b'' &amp;minus; 1), min(''a'', ''b'')]
:::: = [max(0, 0.7 + 0.8&amp;minus;1), min(0.7, 0.8)]
:::: = [0.5, 0.7].
Likewise, the probability of the [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] A ∨ B is surely in the interval
: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;P(A ∨ B) &amp;isin; [max(''a'', ''b''), min(1, ''a'' + ''b'')]
:::: = [max(0.7, 0.8), min(1, 0.7 + 0.8)]
:::: = [0.8, 1].

These intervals are contrasted with the results obtained from the rules of [[Probability#Independent probability|probability assuming independence]], where the probability of the conjunction is P(A &amp; B) = ''a'' &amp;times; ''b'' = 0.7 &amp;times; 0.8 = 0.56, and the probability of the disjunction is P(A ∨ B) = ''a'' + ''b'' &amp;minus; ''a'' &amp;times; ''b'' = 0.94.

When the marginal probabilities are very small (or large), the 
Fréchet intervals are strongly asymmetric about the analogous results under independence.  For example, suppose P(A) = 0.000002 = 2&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;6&lt;/sup&gt; and P(B) = 0.000003 = 3&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;6&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then the Fréchet inequalities say P(A &amp; B) is in the interval [0, 2&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;6&lt;/sup&gt;], and P(A ∨ B) is in the interval [3&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;6&lt;/sup&gt;, 5&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;6&lt;/sup&gt;]. If A and B are independent, however, the probability of A &amp; B is 6&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;12&lt;/sup&gt; which is, comparatively, very close to the lower limit (zero) of the Fréchet interval.  Similarly, the probability of A ∨ B is 4.999994&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;6&lt;/sup&gt;, which is very close to the upper limit of the Fréchet interval.  This is what justifies the rare-event approximation&lt;ref&gt;Collet, J. (1996). Some remarks on rare-event approximation. ''IEEE Transactions on Reliability'' '''45''': 106–108.&lt;/ref&gt; often used in [[reliability theory]].&lt;!--

--&gt;

==Proofs==
The proofs are elementary.  Recall that P(''A'' ∨ ''B'') = P(''A'') + P(''B'') &amp;minus; P(''A'' &amp; ''B''), which implies P(''A'') + P(''B'') &amp;minus; P(''A'' ∨ ''B'') = P(''A'' &amp; ''B'').  Because all probabilities are no bigger than 1, we know P(''A'' ∨ ''B'') ≤ 1, which implies that P(''A'') + P(''B'') &amp;minus; 1 ≤ P(''A'' &amp; ''B''). Because all probabilities are also positive we can similarly say 0 ≤ P(''A'' &amp; ''B''), so max(0, P(''A'') + P(''B'') &amp;minus; 1) ≤ P(''A'' &amp; ''B''). This gives the lower bound on the conjunction.

To get the upper bound, recall that P(''A'' &amp; ''B'') = P(''A''|''B'') P(''B'') = P(''B''|''A'') P(''A''). Because P(''A''|''B'') ≤ 1 and P(''B''|''A'') ≤ 1, we know P(''A'' &amp; ''B'') ≤ P(''A'') and P(''A'' &amp; ''B'') ≤ P(''B'').  Therefore, P(''A'' &amp; ''B'') ≤ min(P(''A''), P(''B'')), which is the upper bound.

The best-possible nature of these bounds follows from observing that they are realized by some dependency between the events A and B.  Comparable bounds on the disjunction are similarly derived.

==Extensions==
When the input probabilities are themselves interval ranges, the Fréchet formulas still work as a [[Probability bounds analysis#Logical expressions|probability bounds analysis]].

==Quantum Fréchet bounds==
It is interesting that similar bounds hold also in [[Quantum Mechanics]] in the case of [[Separable state|separable quantum systems]] and that [[Entangled state|entangled]] states violate these bounds.&lt;ref name="benavoli2016"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Benavoli| first1=A.| last2=Facchini| first2=A.| last3=Zaffalon|first3=M.|title=Quantum mechanics: The Bayesian theory generalized to the space of Hermitian matrices|journal=Physical Review A |date=10 October 2016|volume=94|issue=4|pages=1–27| doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.94.042106| arxiv=1605.08177| url=http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.042106| bibcode=2016PhRvA..94d2106B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let us consider a composite quantum system. In particular, we focus on a composite quantum system ''AB'' made by two finite subsystems denoted as ''A'' and ''B''. Assume that we know the [[density matrix]] of the subsystem ''A'', i.e., &lt;math&gt;\rho^A&lt;/math&gt; that is a trace-one positive definite matrix in &lt;math&gt;\C_{h}^{n\times n}&lt;/math&gt; (the space of [[Hermitian matrices]] of dimension &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt;), and the density matrix of subsystem ''B'' denoted as &lt;math&gt;\rho^B.&lt;/math&gt; We can think of &lt;math&gt;\rho^A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho^B&lt;/math&gt; as the ''marginals'' of the subsystems ''A'' and ''B''. From the knowledge of these marginals, we want to infer something about the ''joint'' &lt;math&gt;\rho^{AB}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\C_{h}^{nm\times nm}.&lt;/math&gt; We restrict our attention to ''joint'' &lt;math&gt;\rho^{AB}&lt;/math&gt; that are [[Separable state|separable]]. A density matrix on a composite system is separable if there exist &lt;math&gt;p_k\geq 0, \{\rho_1^k \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{ \rho_2^k \}&lt;/math&gt; which are mixed states of the respective subsystems such that

:&lt;math&gt;\rho^{AB}=\sum_k p_k \rho_1^k \otimes \rho_2^k&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_k p_k = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Otherwise &lt;math&gt;\rho^{AB}&lt;/math&gt; is called an entangled state.

For [[Separable state#Separability for mixed states|separable density matrices]] &lt;math&gt; \rho^{AB}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\C_{h}^{nm\times nm}&lt;/math&gt; the following Fréchet like bounds hold:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases} \rho^{AB} \leq \rho^{A} \otimes I_m \\ \rho^{AB} \leq I_n \otimes \rho^{B} \\[6pt] \rho^{AB} \geq \rho^A \otimes I_m + I_n \otimes \rho^B-I_{nm} \\ \rho^{AB} \gneq 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The inequalities are [[Positive-definite matrix|matrix inequalities]], &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[tensor product]] and &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; the [[identity matrix]] of dimension &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. It is evident that structurally the above inequalities are analogues of the classical Fréchet bounds for the logical conjunction. It is also worth to notice that when the matrices &lt;math&gt;\rho^A,\rho^B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho^{AB}&lt;/math&gt; are restricted to be diagonal, we obtain the classical Fréchet bounds.

The upper bound is known in Quantum Mechanics as [[reduction criterion]] for density matrices; it was first proven by &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Phys. Rev. A|volume='''59'''|pages= 4206|year=1999|author=M. Horodecki and P. Horodecki| title=Reduction criterion of separability and limits for a class of distillation protocols |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.59.4206| arxiv=quant-ph/9708015|bibcode = 1999PhRvA..59.4206H }}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently formulated by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Phys. Rev. A|volume='''60'''|pages= 898|year=1999|author=N. Cerf|title=Reduction criterion for separability|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.60.898|arxiv=quant-ph/9710001|bibcode = 1999PhRvA..60..898C |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower bound has been obtained in &lt;ref name=benavoli2016/&gt;{{rp|Theorem A.16}} that provides a Bayesian interpretation of these bounds.

===Numerical examples===
We have observed when the matrices &lt;math&gt;\rho^A,\rho^B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho^{AB}&lt;/math&gt; are all diagonal, we obtain the classical Fréchet bounds. To show that, let us consider again the previous numerical example:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\rho^A &amp; = \text{diag}(p_{a},p_{\bar{a}})=\text{diag}(0.7,0.3) \\
\rho^B &amp; = \text{diag}(p_{b},p_{\bar{b}})=\text{diag}(0.8,0.2)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

then we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\rho^{AB}&amp;= \text{diag}(p_{ab},p_{a\bar{b}},p_{\bar{a}b},p_{\bar{a}\bar{b}}) \leqslant \rho^{A} \otimes I_2 =\text{diag}(0.7,0.7,0.3,0.3) \\
\rho^{AB}&amp;= \text{diag}(p_{ab},p_{a\bar{b}},p_{\bar{a}b},p_{\bar{a}\bar{b}}) \leqslant I_2 \otimes \rho^{B} =\text{diag}(0.8,0.2,0.8,0.2) \\
\rho^{AB}&amp;= \text{diag}(p_{ab},p_{a\bar{b}},p_{\bar{a}b},p_{\bar{a}\bar{b}}) \geqslant \rho^{A} \otimes I_2 + I_2 \otimes \rho^{B} - I_4 = \text{diag}(0.5, -0.1, 0.1, -0.5) \\
\rho^{AB}&amp;=\text{diag}(p_{ab},p_{a\bar{b}},p_{\bar{a}b},p_{\bar{a}\bar{b}}) \geqslant 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which means:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 0.5  &amp;\leqslant  p_{ab}             \leqslant 0.7 \\
 0    &amp;\leqslant  p_{a\bar{b}}       \leqslant 0.2 \\
 0.1  &amp;\leqslant  p_{\bar{a}b}       \leqslant 0.3 \\
 0    &amp;\leqslant  p_{\bar{a}\bar{b}} \leqslant 0.2 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It is worth to point out that [[Entangled state|entangled]] states violate the above Fréchet bounds. Consider for instance the entangled density matrix (which is not separable):

:&lt;math&gt;\rho^{AB}=\frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp;0 &amp; 1\\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp;0 &amp; 0\\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp;0 &amp; 0\\ 
1 &amp; 0 &amp;0 &amp; 1\\ 
 \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

which has marginal

:&lt;math&gt;\rho^A=\rho^B=\text{diag}\left(\tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{2} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Entangled states are not separable and it can easily be verified that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \rho^A \otimes I_m-\rho^{AB} \ngeqslant0 \\ I_n \otimes \rho^B -\rho^{AB} \ngeqslant0 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

since the resulting matrices have one negative eigenvalue.

Another example of violation of probabilistic bounds is provided by the famous [[Bell inequality|Bell's inequality]]: entangled states exhibit a form of ''stochastic'' dependence stronger than the strongest classical dependence: and in fact they violate Fréchet like bounds.

His major work was [[Dasadhyayi]], a commentary on the first ten chapters of the astrological text [[Brihat Jataka]] composed by [[Varahamihira|Varāhamihira]] (505 – 587 [[BCE|CE]]). This is considered to be the most important of the 70 known commentaries on this text.&lt;ref name="Joseph"/&gt; Bhaṭṭathiri had also authored another important work in astrology titled ''Muhūrttaratnaṃ''. [[Paramesvara]] (ca.1380–1460), an astronomer of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics known for the introduction of the ''Dṛggaṇita'' system of astronomical computations, had composed an extensive commentary on this work. In this commentary Paramesvara had indicated that he was a grandson of a disciple of the author of ''Muhūrttaratnaṃ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Govonda Bhattathiri|title=Muhurtha Rathnam (Sri Parameshwarakritha Vyakhyopetham)|editor=A.

'''Helge Arnulf Tverberg''' (born 6 March 1935) is a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]]. He was a professor in the Mathematics Department at the [[University of Bergen]], his speciality being [[combinatorics]]; he retired at the mandatory age of seventy.

He was born in [[Bergen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://meldinger.uib.no/engelsk.php?id=191101115828|title=Meet the mathematician, Helge Tverberg|date=November 22, 2001|publisher=University of Bergen}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the [[cand.real.]] degree at the University of Bergen in 1958, and the [[dr.philos.]] degree in 1968. He was a lecturer from 1958 to 1971 and professor from 1971 to his retirement in 2005. He was a visiting scholar at the [[University of Reading]] in 1966 and at the [[Australian National University]], in Canberra, from 1980 to 1981, 1987 to 1988 and in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=70 år 6. mars: Professor, dr. philos.

Tverberg, in 1965, proved a result on intersection patterns of partitions of [[point configuration]]s that has come to be known  as [[Tverberg's partition theorem]]. It inaugurated a new branch of [[combinatorial geometry]], with many variations and applications. An account by [[Günter M. Ziegler]] of Tverberg's work in this direction appeared in the issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society for April, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201104/rtx110400550p.pdf|title=3N Colored Points in a Plane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2254">In [[mathematical logic]], '''Heyting arithmetic''' (sometimes abbreviated '''HA''') is an axiomatization of arithmetic in accordance with the philosophy of [[intuitionism]] (Troelstra 1973:18).  It is named after [[Arend Heyting]], who first proposed it.

==Introduction==
Heyting arithmetic adopts the axioms of [[Peano arithmetic]] (PA), but uses [[intuitionistic logic]] as its rules of inference.  In particular, the [[law of the excluded middle]] does not hold in general, though the induction axiom can be used to prove many specific cases.  For instance, one can prove that {{nowrap|1=∀ ''x'', ''y'' ∈ '''N''' : ''x'' = ''y'' ∨ ''x'' ≠ ''y''}} is a theorem (any two [[natural number]]s are either equal to each other, or not equal to each other). In fact, since "=" is the only [[Predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] symbol in Heyting arithmetic, it then follows that, for any [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]-free formula ''p'', {{nowrap|1=∀ ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', … ∈ '''N''' : ''p'' ∨ ¬''p''}} is a theorem (where ''x'', ''y'', ''z''… are the [[free variables]] in ''p'').

==History==
[[Kurt Gödel]] studied the relationship between Heyting arithmetic and Peano arithmetic.  He used the [[Gödel–Gentzen negative translation]] to prove in 1933 that if HA is consistent, then PA is also consistent.

==Related concepts==
Heyting arithmetic should not be confused with [[Heyting algebra]]s, which are the intuitionistic analogue of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]].

In [[geometry]], an '''''n''-orthotope'''&lt;ref name=regpoly&gt;Coxeter, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; (also called a '''hyperrectangle''' or a '''box''') is the generalization of a [[rectangle]] for higher dimensions, formally defined as the [[Cartesian product]] of [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]].

==Types==
A three-dimensional ''orthotope'' is also called a right rectangular [[Prism (geometry)|prism]], rectangular [[cuboid]], or rectangular [[parallelepiped]].

A special case of an ''n-orthotope'', where all edges are equal length, is the ''n-[[hypercube|cube]]''.&lt;ref name=regpoly&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By analogy, the term "hyperrectangle" or "box" refers to Cartesian products of [[orthogonal]] intervals of other kinds, such as ranges of keys in [[database theory]] or ranges of [[integer]]s, rather than [[real number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{citation

The [[dual polytope]] of an ''n''-orthotope has been variously called a rectangular n-[[orthoplex]], rhombic ''n''-fusil, or ''n''-[[lozenge]]. It is constructed by 2''n'' points located in the center of the orthotope rectangular faces.

An n-fusil's [[Schläfli symbol]] can be represented by a sum of ''n'' orthogonal line segments: { } + { } + ... + { }.

A 1-fusil is a [[line segment]]. A 2-fusil is a [[rhombus]]. Its plane cross selections in all pairs of axes are [[rhombus|rhombi]].

&lt;br/&gt;Logical symbols representing ''iff''

In [[logic]] and related fields such as [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]], '''if and only if''' (shortened '''iff''') is a [[biconditional]] [[logical connective]] between statements.

In that it is [[biconditional]] (a statement of '''material equivalence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Copi |first=I. M. |last2=Cohen |first2=C. |last3=Flage |first3=D. E. |year=2006 |title=Essentials of Logic |edition=Second |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson Education |page=197 |isbn=978-0-13-238034-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the connective can be likened to the standard [[material conditional]] ("only if", equal to "if ... then") combined with its reverse ("if"); hence the name. The result is that the truth of either one of the connected statements requires the truth of the other (i.e. either both statements are true, or both are false). It is controversial whether the connective thus defined is properly rendered by the English "if and only if", with its pre-existing meaning.

In writing, phrases commonly used, with debatable propriety, as alternatives to P "if and only if" Q include: ''Q is [[Necessary and sufficient conditions#Simultaneous necessity and sufficiency|necessary and sufficient]] for P'', ''P is equivalent (or materially equivalent) to Q'' (compare [[material conditional|material implication]]), ''P precisely if Q'', ''P precisely (or exactly) when Q'', ''P exactly in case Q'', and ''P just in case Q''.&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. "Iff." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Iff.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors regard "iff" as unsuitable in formal writing;&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{citation |title=Reading, Writing, and Proving: A Closer Look at Mathematics |series=[[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]] |first1=Ulrich |last1=Daepp |first2=Pamela |last2=Gorkin|author2-link=Pamela Gorkin |publisher=Springer |year=2011 |isbn=9781441994790 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4QKcaXrVZb0C&amp;pg=PA52 |page=52 |quote=While it can be a real time-saver, we don't recommend it in formal writing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; others use it freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Engineering Writing by Design: Creating Formal Documents of Lasting Value |first1=Edward J. |last1=Rothwell |first2=Michael J. |last2=Cloud |publisher=CRC Press |year=2014 |isbn=9781482234312 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=muXMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 |quote=It is common in mathematical writing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is equivalent to that produced by the [[XNOR gate]], and opposite to that produced by the [[XOR gate]].

==Usage==

===Notation===
The corresponding logical symbols are "↔", "&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;", and "[[Triple bar|≡]]", and sometimes "iff". These are usually treated as equivalent. However, some texts of [[mathematical logic]] (particularly those on [[first-order logic]], rather than [[propositional logic]]) make a distinction between these, in which the first, ↔, is used as a symbol in logic formulas, while ⇔ is used in reasoning about those logic formulas (e.g., in [[metalogic]]). In [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]]'s notation, it is the prefix symbol 'E'.

Another term for this [[logical connective]] is [[exclusive nor]].

In [[TeX]] "if and only if" is shown as a long double arrow: &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; via command \iff.

===Proofs===
In most [[logical system]]s, one [[Proof theory|proves]] a statement of the form "P iff Q" by proving "if P, then Q" and "if Q, then P".  Proving this pair of statements sometimes leads to a more natural proof since there are not obvious conditions in which one would infer a biconditional directly. An alternative is to prove the [[disjunction]] "(P and Q) or (not-P and not-Q)", which itself can be inferred directly from either of its disjuncts—that is, because "iff" is [[truth-function]]al, "P iff Q" follows if P and Q have both been shown true, or both false.

===Origin of iff and pronunciation===
Usage of the abbreviation "iff" first appeared in print in [[John L. Kelley]]'s 1955 book ''General Topology''.&lt;ref&gt;''General Topology,'' reissue {{ISBN|978-0-387-90125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its invention is often credited to [[Paul Halmos]], who wrote "I invented 'iff,' for  'if and only if'—but I could never believe I was really its first inventor."&lt;ref name="Higham1998"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nicholas J. Higham |title=Handbook of writing for the mathematical sciences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQd2fJA7Y4C&amp;pg=PA24 |year=1998 |publisher=SIAM |isbn=978-0-89871-420-3 |page=24 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is somewhat unclear how "iff" was meant to be pronounced. In current practice, the single 'word' "iff" is almost always read as the four words "if and only if". However, in the preface of ''General Topology'', Kelley suggests that it should be read differently: "In some cases where mathematical content requires 'if and only if' and [[euphony]] demands something less I use Halmos' 'iff'". The authors of one discrete mathematics textbook suggest:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Discrete Algorithmic Mathematics |last=Maurer |first=Stephen B. |last2=Ralston |first2=Anthony |publisher=CRC Press |year=2005 |isbn=1568811667 |edition=3rd |location=Boca Raton, Fla. |pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Should you need to pronounce iff, really [[Consonant gemination|hang on to the 'ff']] so that people hear the difference from 'if'", implying that "iff" could be pronounced as {{IPA|[ɪfː]}}.

=== Usage in definitions ===
Technically, definitions are always "if and only if" statements; many texts such as Kelley's ''General Topology'' follow the strict demands of logic, and use "if and only if" or ''iff'' in definitions of new terms (for instance, from ''General Topology'', p. 25: "A set is '''countable''' iff it is finite or countably infinite" [boldface in original]). However, this usage of "if and only if" is not universal; often, mathematical definitions follow the special convention that "if" is interpreted to mean "if and only if" (for example, one might say, "A topological space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=71 |first=Steven G. |last=Krantz |title=A Primer of Mathematical Writing |year=1996 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |isbn=978-0-8218-0635-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction from "if" and "only if"==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
# '''"Madison will eat the fruit &lt;u&gt;if&lt;/u&gt; it is an apple."''' (equivalent to '''"&lt;u&gt;Only if&lt;/u&gt; Madison will eat the fruit, it is an apple;"''' or '''"Madison will eat the fruit ''←'' fruit is an apple"''')
#: This states that Madison will eat fruits that are apples. It does not, however, exclude the possibility that Madison might also eat bananas or other types of fruit. All that is known for certain is that she will eat any and all apples that she happens upon. That the fruit is an apple is a ''sufficient'' condition for Madison to eat the fruit.
# '''"Madison will eat the fruit &lt;u&gt;only if&lt;/u&gt; it is an apple."''' (equivalent to '''"&lt;u&gt;If&lt;/u&gt; Madison will eat the fruit, then it is an apple"''' or '''"Madison will eat the fruit ''→'' fruit is an apple"''')
#: This states that the only fruit Madison will eat is an apple. It does not, however, exclude the possibility that Madison will refuse an apple if it is made available, in contrast with (1), which requires Madison to eat any available apple. In this case, that a given fruit is an apple is a ''necessary'' condition for Madison to be eating it. It is not a sufficient condition since Madison might not eat all the apples she is given.
# '''"Madison will eat the fruit &lt;u&gt;if and only if&lt;/u&gt; it is an apple"''' (equivalent to '''"Madison will eat the fruit ''↔'' fruit is an apple"''')
#: This statement makes it clear that Madison will eat all and only those fruits that are apples. She will not leave any apple uneaten, and she will not eat any other type of fruit. That a given fruit is an apple is both a ''necessary'' and a ''sufficient'' condition for Madison to eat the fruit.

Sufficiency is the converse of necessity. That is to say, given ''P''→''Q'' (i.e. if ''P'' then ''Q''), ''P'' would be a sufficient condition for ''Q'', and ''Q'' would be a necessary condition for ''P''. Also, given ''P''→''Q'', it is true that ''¬Q''→''¬P'' (where ¬ is the negation operator, i.e. "not"). This means that the relationship between ''P'' and ''Q'', established by ''P''→''Q'', can be expressed in the following, all equivalent, ways:
:''P'' is sufficient for ''Q''
:''Q'' is necessary for ''P''
:''¬Q'' is sufficient for ''¬P''
:''¬P'' is necessary for ''¬Q''
As an example, take (1), above, which states ''P''→''Q'', where ''P'' is "the fruit in question is an apple" and ''Q'' is "Madison will eat the fruit in question". The following are four equivalent ways of expressing this very relationship:
:If the fruit in question is an apple, then Madison will eat it.
:Only if Madison will eat the fruit in question, is it an apple.
:If Madison will not eat the fruit in question, then it is not an apple.
:Only if the fruit in question is not an apple, will Madison not eat it.
So we see that (2), above, can be restated in the form of ''if...then'' as "If Madison will eat the fruit in question, then it is an apple"; taking this in conjunction with (1), we find that (3) can be stated as "If the fruit in question is an apple, then Madison will eat it; ''and'' if Madison will eat the fruit, then it is an apple".

==In terms of Euler diagrams==
&lt;gallery widths="270"&gt;
File:Example of A is a proper subset of B.svg|A is a proper subset of B. A number is in A only if it is in B; a number is in B if it is in A.
File:Example of C is no proper subset of B.svg|C is a subset but not a proper subset of B. A number is in B if and only if it is in C, and a number is in C if and only if it is in B.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Euler diagram]]s show logical relationships among events, properties, and so forth. "P only if Q", "if P then Q", and  "P→Q" all mean that P is a [[subset]], either proper or improper, of Q. "P if Q", "if Q then P", and Q→P all mean that Q is a proper or improper subset of P. "P if and only if Q" and "Q if and only if P" both mean that the sets P and Q are identical to each other.

==More general usage==
Iff is used outside the field of logic. Wherever logic is applied, especially in [[mathematics|mathematical]] discussions, it has the same meaning as above: it is an abbreviation for ''if and only if'', indicating that one statement is both [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient]] for the other. This is an example of [[mathematical jargon]]. (However, as noted above, ''if'', rather than ''iff'', is more often used in statements of definition.)

The elements of ''X'' are ''all and only'' the elements of ''Y'' is used to mean: "for any ''z'' in the [[domain of discourse]], ''z'' is in ''X'' if and only if ''z'' is in ''Y''."

He proved the first extension theorems for [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz functions]] not reducible to one-point extensions and solved the reverse isoperimetric problem. He produced a sharp version of the [[Uniform boundedness principle|Banach-Steinhaus Theorem]] conjectured in the 50s, and proved that infinitely many values of the [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann function]] at odd integers are irrational (with Rivoal). (With [[Shiri Artstein|Artstein]], [[Franck Barthe|Barthe]] and [[Assaf Naor|Naor]]) he answered a fundamental question in information theory by showing that the central limit theorem of probability is driven by an analogue of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Since 2010 Ball has served as Scientific Director of ICMS in Edinburgh. He also successfully popularises science, for example in his book "Strange curves. ... "&lt;ref name="royal"/&gt;}}

'''Leonard Eugene Dickson''' (January 22, 1874&amp;nbsp;– January 17, 1954) was an American [[mathematician]]. He was one of the first American researchers in [[abstract algebra]], in particular the theory of finite [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[classical group]]s, and is also remembered for a three-volume history of [[number theory]], ''[[History of the Theory of Numbers]]''.

==Life==
Dickson considered himself a Texan by virtue of having grown up in [[Cleburne, Texas|Cleburne]], where his father was a banker, merchant, and real estate investor. He attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where [[George Bruce Halsted]] encouraged his study of mathematics. Dickson earned a B.S. in 1893 and an M.S. in 1894, under Halsted's supervision. Dickson first specialised in Halsted's own specialty, [[geometry]].&lt;ref name=AAA&gt;[[A. A. Albert]] (1955) [http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/dickson-leonard.pdf Leonard Eugene Dickson 1874–1954] from [[National Academy of Sciences]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Harvard University]] welcomed Dickson as a Ph.D. student, and Dickson initially accepted Harvard's offer, but chose to attend Chicago instead. In 1896, when he was only 22 years of age, he was awarded Chicago's first doctorate in mathematics, for a dissertation titled ''The Analytic Representation of Substitutions on a Power of a Prime Number of Letters with a Discussion of the Linear Group'', supervised by [[E. H. Moore]].

Dickson then went to [[Leipzig]] and [[Paris]] to study under [[Sophus Lie]] and [[Camille Jordan]], respectively. On returning to the USA, he became an instructor at the [[University of California]]. In 1899 and at the extraordinarily young age of 25, Dickson was appointed associate professor at the University of Texas. Chicago countered by offering him a position in 1900, and he spent the balance of his career there. At Chicago, he supervised 53 Ph.D. theses; his most accomplished student was probably [[A. A. Albert]]. He was a visiting professor at the [[University of California]] in 1914, 1918, and 1922. In 1939, he returned to Texas to retire.

Dickson married Susan McLeod Davis in 1902; they had two children, Campbell and Eleanor.

Dickson was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1913, and was also a member of the American Philosophical Society, the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[London Mathematical Society]], the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and the Union of Czech Mathematicians and Physicists. Dickson was the first recipient of a prize created in 1924 by The American Association for the Advancement of Science, for his work on the arithmetics of algebras. Harvard (1936) and Princeton (1941) awarded him honorary doctorates.

Dickson presided over the  [[American Mathematical Society]] in 1917–1918. His December 1918 presidential address, titled "Mathematics in War Perspective," criticized American mathematics for falling short of those of Britain, France, and Germany:

:"Let it not again become possible that thousands of young men shall be so seriously handicapped in their Army and Navy work by lack of adequate preparation in mathematics."

In 1928, he was also the first recipient of the [[Cole Prize]] for algebra, awarded annually by the AMS, for his book ''Algebren und ihre Zahlentheorie''.

It appears that Dickson was a hard man:

:"A hard-bitten character, Dickson tended to speak his mind bluntly; he was always sparing in his praise for the work of others. ... he indulged his serious passions for bridge and billiards and reportedly did not like to lose at either game."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Parshall (1999) "Leonard Eugene Dickson" in ''American National Biography'', volume 6, [[Oxford University Press]], pp 578–79&lt;/ref&gt;

:"He delivered terse and unpolished lectures and spoke sternly to his students. ... Given Dickson's intolerance for student weaknesses in mathematics, however, his comments could be harsh, even though not intended to be personal. He did not aim to make students feel good about themselves."&lt;ref name=DDF&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fenster | first1 = D. D. | year = 1997 | title = Role modeling in mathematics: the case of Leonard Eugene Dickson (1874–1954) | url = | journal = [[Historia Mathematica]] | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 7–24 | doi=10.1006/hmat.1997.2120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Dickson had a sudden death trial for his prospective doctoral students: he assigned a preliminary problem which was shorter than a dissertation problem, and if the student could solve it in three months, Dickson would agree to oversee the graduate student's work. If not the student had to look elsewhere for an advisor."&lt;ref name=DDF/&gt;

==Work==
Dickson had a major impact on American mathematics, especially [[abstract algebra]]. His mathematical output consists of 18 books and more than 250 papers. The ''Collected Mathematical Papers of Leonard Eugene Dickson'' fill six large volumes.

==The algebraist==
In 1901, Dickson published his first book ''Linear groups with an exposition of the Galois field theory'', a revision and expansion of his Ph.D. thesis. Teubner in Leipzig published the book, as there was no well-established American scientific publisher at the time. Dickson had already published 43 research papers in the preceding five years; all but seven on [[finite linear group]]s. Parshall (1991) described the book as follows:

:"Dickson presented a unified, complete, and general theory of the [[classical linear group]]s—not merely over the [[prime field]] GF(''p'') as [[Camille Jordan|Jordan]] had done—but over the general [[finite field]] GF(''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''), and he did this against the backdrop of a well-developed theory of these underlying [[field (algebra)|field]]s. ... his book represented the first systematic treatment of [[finite field]]s in the mathematical literature."

An appendix in this book lists the non-abelian simple groups then known having order less than 1 billion. He listed 53 of the 56 having order less than 1 million. The remaining three were found in 1960, 1965, and 1967.

Dickson worked on [[finite field]]s and extended the theory of [[linear associative algebra]]s initiated by [[Joseph Wedderburn]] and [[Élie Cartan|Cartan]].

He started the study of [[modular invariants of a group]].

In 1905, Wedderburn, then at Chicago on a Carnegie Fellowship, published a paper that included three claimed proofs of a theorem stating that all finite [[division algebra]]s were [[commutative]], now known as [[Wedderburn's little theorem|Wedderburn's theorem]]. The proofs all made clever use of the interplay between the [[Ring (mathematics)|additive group]] of a finite [[division algebra]] ''A'', and the [[multiplicative group]] ''A''*&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{0}. [[Karen Parshall]] noted that the first of these three proofs had a gap not noticed at the time. Dickson also found a proof of this result but, believing Wedderburn's first proof to be correct, Dickson acknowledged Wedderburn's priority. But Dickson also noted that Wedderburn constructed his second and third proofs only after having seen Dickson's proof. She concluded that Dickson should be credited with the first correct proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parshall | first1 = Karen | authorlink = Karen Parshall | year = 1983 | title = In pursuit of the finite division algebra theorem and beyond: Joseph H M Wedderburn, Leonard Dickson, and Oswald Veblen | url = | journal = Archives of International History of Science | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 274–99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickson's search for a counterexample to Wedderburn's theorem led him to investigate [[Algebra over a field#Non-associative algebras|nonassociative algebras]], and in a series of papers he found all possible three and four-dimensional (nonassociative) [[division algebra]]s over a [[field (algebra)|field]].

In 1919 Dickson constructed [[Cayley numbers]] by a doubling process starting with [[quaternion]]s ℍ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Dickson | first1=L. E. | title=On Quaternions and Their Generalization and the History of the Eight Square Theorem | jstor=1967865  | series=2nd | year=1919 | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | issn=0003-486X | volume=20 | issue=3 | pages=155–171 | doi=10.2307/1967865}}&lt;/ref&gt; His method was extended to a doubling of ℝ to produce ℂ, and of ℂ to produce ℍ by [[A. A. Albert]] in 1922, and the procedure is known now as the [[Cayley–Dickson construction]] of [[composition algebra]]s.

==The number theorist==
Dickson proved many interesting results in [[number theory]], using results of [[Ivan Matveyevich Vinogradov|Vinogradov]] to deduce the ideal [[Waring's problem|Waring theorem]] in his investigations of [[additive number theory]]. He proved the [[Waring's problem]] for &lt;math&gt;k\ge 7&lt;/math&gt; under the further condition of
:&lt;math&gt;(3^k + 1)/(2^k - 1)\le [1.5^k] + 1&lt;/math&gt;

independently of [[Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai]] who proved it for &lt;math&gt;k\ge 6&lt;/math&gt; ahead of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Number Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BkBSfFjT1BgC&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=15 July 2013|year=2003|publisher=Universities Press|isbn=978-81-7371-454-2|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-volume ''[[History of the Theory of Numbers]]'' (1919–23) is still much consulted today, covering divisibility and primality, [[Diophantine analysis]], and [[quadratic form|quadratic]] and higher forms. The work contains little interpretation and makes no attempt to contextualize the results being described, yet it contains essentially every significant number theoretic idea from the dawn of mathematics up to the 1920s except for quadratic reciprocity and higher reciprocity laws. A planned fourth volume on these topics was never written. [[A. A. Albert]] remarked that this three volume work "would be a life's work by itself for a more ordinary man."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6838">In [[signal processing]], '''Lulu [[smoothing]]''' is a [[nonlinear]] mathematical technique for removing impulsive [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] from a data sequence such as a [[time series]]. It is a nonlinear equivalent to taking a [[moving average]] (or other smoothing technique) of a time series, and is similar to other [[nonlinear smoothing]] techniques, such as Tukey&lt;ref name="Tukey" /&gt; or [[Median filter|median smoothing]].[[File:LUSmoother width=1.png|thumb|LU smoother of width 1 applied to a noisy sequence]] LULU smoothers are compared in detail to median smoothers by Jankowitz&lt;ref name="jankowitz2007some" /&gt; and found to be superior in some aspects, particularly in mathematical properties like [[idempotence]].

== Properties ==
Lulu operators have a  number of attractive mathematical properties, among them [[idempotence]] – meaning that repeated application of the operator yields the same result as a single application – and co-idempotence. 
An interpretation of idempotence is that: 'Idempotence means that there is no “noise” left in the smoothed data and co-idempotence means that there is no “signal” left in the residual.'&lt;ref name="conradie2006exact" /&gt;

When studying smoothers there are four properties that are useful to optimize:&lt;ref name="rohwer2005nonlinear" /&gt;

# Effectiveness
# Consistency
# Stability
# Efficiency

The operators can also be used to decompose a signal into various subcomponents&lt;ref name="fabris2009lulu" /&gt; similar to wavelet or Fourier decomposition.

== History ==
Lulu smoothers were discovered  by C. H. Rohwer&lt;ref name="Rohwer1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohwer" /&gt; and have been studied for the last 30 years. Their exact and asymptotic distributions have been derived.&lt;ref name="conradie2006exact" /&gt;

== Operation ==
Applying a Lulu smoother consists of repeated applications of the min and max operators over a given subinterval of the data.
As with other smoothers, a width or interval must be specified. The Lulu smoothers are composed of repeated applications of the ''L'' (lower) and ''U'' (Upper) operators, which are defined as follows:

=== L operator ===
For an L operator of width ''n'' over an infinite sequence of ''x''s (..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;,...), the operation on ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated as follows:

# Firstly we create (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) mini-sequences of length (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) each.  Each of these mini-sequences contains the element ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, for width 1, we create 2 mini-sequences of length 2 each. For width 1 these mini sequences are (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;). For width 2, the mini-sequences are (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;), (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+2&lt;/sub&gt;). For width 2, we refer to these mini-sequences as seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;
# Then we take the minimum of each of the mini sequences. Again for width 2 this gives: (Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;)). This gives us (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) numbers for each point.
# Lastly we take the maximum of (the minimums of the mini sequences), or Max(Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;)) and this becomes ''L''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;)

Thus for width 2, the ''L'' operator is:

: ''L''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) =  Max(Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;))

=== U Operator ===
This is identical to  the L operator, except that the order of Min and Max is reversed, i.e. for width 2:

: ''U''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) =  Min(Max(seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;), Max(seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), Max(seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;))

=== Examples ===
Examples of the ''U'' and ''L'' operators, as well as combined ''UL'' and ''LU'' operators on a sample data set are shown in the following figures.

[[File:LSmoother width=1.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|L Smoother width 1]]
[[File:USmoother width=1.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|U Smoother width 1]]

It can be seen that the results of the ''UL'' and ''LU'' operators can be different. The combined operators are very effective at removing impulsive noise, the only cases where the noise is not removed effectively is where we get multiple noise signals very close together, in which case the filter 'sees' the multiple noises as part of the signal.

The '''magic constant''' or '''magic sum''' of a [[magic square]] is the sum of numbers in any row, column, or diagonal of the magic square. For example, the magic square shown below has a magic constant of 15. In general &lt;math&gt;M = n \cdot \frac{n^2 + 1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the side length of the square.
[[File:Magicsquareexample.svg|center]]


The term '''magic constant''' or '''magic sum''' is similarly applied to other "magic" figures such as [[magic star]]s and [[magic cube]]s. Number shapes on a triangular grid divided into equal polyiamond areas containing equal sums give a polyiamond magic constant.&lt;ref name="Polyiamond Magic Constant"&gt;http://oeis.org/A303295/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magic stars==
The magic constant of an ''n''-pointed normal magic star is &lt;math&gt;M = 4n + 2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Magic series==
In 2013 Dirk Kinnaes found the [[magic series]] polytope. The number of unique sequences that form the magic constant is now known up to &lt;math&gt;n=1000&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Trump"&gt;Walter Trump http://www.trump.de/magic-squares/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physics==
In the mass model the value in each cell specifies the mass for that cell.&lt;ref name="Heinz"&gt;Heinz http://www.magic-squares.net/ms-models.htm#A 3 dimensional magic square/&lt;/ref&gt;  This model has two notable properties.  First it demonstrates the balanced nature of all magic squares.  If such a model is suspended from the central cell the structure balances.  ( consider the magic sums of the rows/columns .. equal mass at an equal distance balance).  The second property that can be calculated is the [[moment of inertia]]. Summing the individual moments of inertia ( distance squared from the center x the cell value) gives the moment of inertia for the magic square. "This is the only property of magic squares, aside from the line sums, which is solely dependent on the order of the square"  &lt;ref name="Ivars Peterson"&gt;Peterson http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/7485/description/Magic_Square_Physics/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MiMa Oberwolfach Aussenschild.jpg|thumb]]

'''MiMa''' is a [[museum]] of [[mineralogy]] and [[mathematics]] in [[Oberwolfach]], in the central [[Black Forest]] in southern [[Germany]]. The museum was opened on 30 January 2010 on the site of the mineral museum after a two-year conversion and expansion phase. It is operated jointly by the municipality of Oberwolfach, the Oberwolfach Society of the Friends of Minerals and Mining and the [[Mathematics Research Institute, Oberwolfach]].

== Purpose ==
[[File:MiMa Oberwolfach Hausanschicht.jpg|thumb]]
The idea is to unite the two distinct features of the region in one [[interactive]] museum: the Black Forest minerals of the Society of Friends of Minerals and Mining, Oberwolfach, the knowledge of the Mathematics Research Institute, Oberwolfach.

The museum not only displays minerals from the Black Forest and insights into mathematics, but also the links between these two fields. Interactive installations help to elucidate the themes of [[symmetry (geometry)|symmetry]] and [[crystallography]].

== Minerals ==

The MiMa houses minerals and mining artefacts from the whole of the Black Forest with an emphasis on minerals from the nearby [[Clara Pit]], using films and information. A scale model shows the interior of the interior of the mine with mining galleries and shafts down to sea level. There is information on the ores extracted and there technical usage.

Other exhibits:

* Exhibits from the historic silver mine of [[Wenzel Pit|Wenzel]] in Oberwolfach, including mining lamps and tools.
* Collection of agates from the Artenberg and the Haslach Mining Region and collections from the Wittich Mining Region and from lodes in the southern Black Forest, including Wieden, Schauinsland and Münstertal.
* Computer system with minerals and literature databases, visitor binoculars. Display cabinet of minerals for sale from the Black Forest and other areas worldwide.

== Mathematics ==

[[File:MiMa-Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|Front view of MiMa]]
In the field of mathematics, the subject areas of crystallography and symmetry are explained using interactive programmes. In addition, there is a selection of exhibits from the prize-winning exhibition IMAGINARY (Land of Ideas Prize, 2009) and an installation with historical information about the Oberwolfach Mathematical Research Institute.

Other exhibits:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3579">The '''Moschovakis coding lemma''' is a [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] from descriptive [[set theory]] involving sets of [[real number]]s in the [[axiom of determinacy]] (the principle that every two-player integer game is determined). The lemma was developed and named after the mathematician, [[Yiannis N. Moschovakis]].

The lemma may be expressed generally as follows:

Let Γ be a non-selfdual point-class closed under ∃ ω ω and ∧ , and ≺ a Γ well-founded relation on ω ω of rank θ ∈ ON. Let R ⊆ dom( ≺ ) × ω ω be such that ∀ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ y R ( x,y ) . Then there is a Γ set A ⊆ dom( ≺ ) × ω ω which is a choice set for R , that is: 1. ∀ α &lt; θ ∃ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ y [ | x | ≺ = α ∧ A ( x,y )] . 2. ∀ x ∀ y A ( x,y ) → [ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∧ R ( x,y )] . Proof. We may assume θ is minimal so that the theorem fails, and fix ≺ , R , and a good universal set U ⊆ ( ω ω ) 3 for the Γ subsets of ( ω ω ) 2 . Easily, θ is a limit ordinal. For δ &lt; θ , say u ∈ ω ω codes a δ -choice set provided (1) holds for α ≤ δ using A = U u , and (2) holds for A = U u where we replace x ∈ dom( ≺ ) with x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∧| x | ≺ ≤ δ . By minimality of θ , for all δ &lt; θ there are δ -choice sets. Play the game where I, II play out u,v ∈ ω ω , and II wins provided that if u codes a δ 1 -choice set for some δ 1 &lt; θ , then v codes a δ 2 -choice set for some δ 2 &gt; δ 1 . If I has a winning strategy, we get a Σ 1 1 set B of reals coding δ -choice sets for arbitrarily large δ &lt; θ . Define then A ( x,y ) ↔∃ w ∈ B U ( w,x,y ), which easily works. Suppose now τ is a winning strategy for II. From the s - m - n theorem, let s : ( ω ω ) 2 → ω ω be continuous such that for all {{lang|el|ϵ}},x,t,w, U ( s ({{lang|el|ϵ}},x ) ,t,w ) ↔ ∃ y ∃ z [ y ≺ x ∧ U ({{lang|el|ϵ}},y,z ) ∧ U ( z,t,w )]. By the recursion theorem, let {{lang|el|ϵ}} 0 be such that U ({{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x,z ) ↔ z = τ ( s ({{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x )). A straightforward induction on | x | ≺ for x ∈ dom( ≺ ) shows that ∀ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ ! z U ( {{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x,z ), and ∀ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∀ z [ U ( {{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x,z ) → z codes a ≥| x | ≺ -choice set]. Let A ( x,y ) ↔∃ z ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ w [ U ( {{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,z,w ) ∧ U ( w,x,y )].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1603">The '''Nagata–Smirnov metrization theorem''' in [[topology]] characterizes when a [[topological space]] is [[metrizable]].  The theorem states that a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is metrizable if and only if it is [[regular space|regular]], [[Hausdorff_space|Hausdorff]] and has a [[countably locally finite]] (i.e., σ-locally finite) [[basis (topology)|basis]].

A topological space X is called a regular space if every non-empty closed subset C of X and a point p not contained in C admit non-overlapping open neighborhoods.
A collection in a space X is countably locally finite (or σ-locally finite) if it is the union of a countable family of locally finite collections of subsets of X.

Unlike Urysohn's [[metrization theorem]], which provides only a sufficient condition for metrizability, this theorem provides both a necessary and sufficient condition for a topological space to be metrizable. The theorem is named after [[Jun-iti Nagata|Junichi Nagata]] and Yuriĭ Mikhaĭlovich Smirnov.

In [[mathematics]], the word '''null''' (from {{lang-de|null}} meaning "zero", which is from {{lang-la|nullus}} meaning "none")&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite journal |title="null" |journal=[[The Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision March 2004 |url=http://dictionary.oed.com |year=2004 |accessdate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oald"&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of "null" adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |journal=[[Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary]] 9th |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/null |year=2016 |accessdate=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; means of or related to having [[Empty set|zero members in a set]] or a value of [[zero]]. Sometimes the symbol '''∅''' is used to distinguish "null" from '''0'''.

In a [[norm (mathematics)|normed]] [[vector space]] the [[null vector]] is the zero vector; in a [[norm (mathematics)|seminormed]] vector space such as [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|Minkowski space]], null vectors are, in general, non-zero. In [[set theory]], the [[empty set|null set]] is the set with zero elements; and in [[measure theory]], a [[null set]] is a set with zero measure.

A [[null space]] of a mapping is the part of the domain that is mapped into the null element of the image (the inverse image of the null element).

In [[statistics]], a [[null hypothesis]] is a proposition presumed true unless statistical evidence indicates otherwise.

[[File:Keller Kneser.jpg|thumb|upright|Ott-Heinrich Keller (left) and [[Hellmuth Kneser]].]]
'''Eduard Ott-Heinrich Keller''' (22 June 1906 in Frankfurt (Main), Germany
– 1990 in Halle, Germany) was a German mathematician who worked in the fields of [[geometry]], [[topology]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. He formulated the celebrated problem which is now called the [[Jacobian conjecture]] in 1939.

He was born in [[Frankfurt–am-Main]], and studied at the universities of Frankfurt, [[Vienna]], Berlin and [[Göttingen]]. As a student of [[Max Dehn]] he wrote a dissertation on the [[tessellation|tiling]] of space with [[cube]]s. This led to another 'Keller conjecture': the [[Keller cube-tiling conjecture]] from 1930.

Subsequently he worked with [[Georg Hamel]] in Berlin, [[habilitation|habilitating]] in 1933 with a thesis on [[Cremona transformation]]s. The Jacobian conjecture is quite naturally posed in that setting. The motivation for looking at rather general [[polynomial transformations]], say of the [[projective plane]], came from the [[singularity theory]] for [[algebraic curve]]s.

During [[World War II]] he taught in a naval college in [[Flensburg]]. After the war he had several positions, and was appointed a professor at [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg]] in 1952, as successor of [[Heinrich Jung|H. W. E. Jung]].

In [[mathematics]], a [[system of equations]]  is considered '''overdetermined''' if there are more equations than unknowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Planet Math, Overdetermined|url=http://planetmath.org/overdetermined}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Numerical Linear Algebra for Applications in Statistics|author=Gentle|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=GDvTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Second source doesn't agree with the first source and with the text. A respected primary source is highly needed|date=April 2018}} An overdetermined system is almost always [[inconsistent equations|inconsistent]] (it has no solution) when constructed with random coefficients. However, an overdetermined system will have solutions in some cases, for example if some equation occurs several times in the system, or if some equations are [[linear combination]]s of the others.

The terminology can be described in terms of the concept of [[constraint counting]]. Each [[Variable (mathematics)|unknown]] can be seen as an available degree of freedom. Each equation introduced into the system can be viewed as a [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]] that restricts one [[degree of freedom]]. 
Therefore, the critical case occurs when the number of equations and the number of free variables are equal. For every variable giving a degree of freedom, there exists a corresponding constraint. The ''overdetermined'' case occurs when the system has been overconstrained &amp;mdash; that is, when the equations outnumber the unknowns. In contrast, the ''[[Underdetermined system|underdetermined]]'' case occurs when the system has been underconstrained — that is, when the number of equations is fewer than the number of unknowns. Such systems usually have an infinite number of solutions.

==Systems of equations==

===An example in two dimensions===
[[File:3 equations -1.JPG|thumb|left|#1 A system of three linearly independent equations, three lines, no solutions]]
[[File:3 equations -2.JPG|thumb|right|#2 A system of three linearly independent equations, three lines (two [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]]), no solutions]]
[[File:3 equations -3.JPG|thumb|left|#3 A system of three linearly independent equations, three lines (all parallel), no solutions]]
[[File:3 equations -4.JPG|thumb|right|#4 A system of three equations (one equation linearly dependent on the others), three lines (two coinciding), one solution]]
[[File:3 equations -5.JPG|thumb|left|#5 A system of three equations (one equation linearly dependent on the others), three lines, one solution]]
[[File:3 equations -6.JPG|thumb|right|#6 A system of three equations (two equations each linearly dependent on the third), three coinciding lines, an infinitude of solutions]]

Consider the system of 3 [[equation]]s and 2 unknowns ({{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}}), which is overdetermined because 3&gt;2, and which corresponds to Diagram #1:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
Y&amp;=-2X-1\\
Y&amp;=3X-2\\
Y&amp;=X+1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

There is one solution for each pair of linear equations: for the first and second equations (0.2,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1.4), for the first and third (&amp;minus;2/3,&amp;nbsp;1/3), and for the second and third (1.5,&amp;nbsp;2.5). However, there is no solution that satisfies all three simultaneously. Diagrams #2 and 3 show other configurations that are inconsistent because no point is on all of the lines. Systems of this variety are deemed [[consistent and inconsistent equations|inconsistent]].

The only cases where the overdetermined system does in fact have a solution are demonstrated in Diagrams #4, 5, and 6. These exceptions can occur only when the overdetermined system contains enough [[linearly dependent]] equations that the number of independent equations does not exceed the number of unknowns. Linear dependence means that some equations can be obtained from linearly combining other equations. For example, ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 and 2''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''X''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 are linearly dependent equations because the second one can be obtained by taking twice the first one.

===Matrix form===
Any system of linear equations can be written as a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] equation.
The previous system of equations (in Diagram #1) can be written as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
 2 &amp; 1 \\
-3 &amp; 1 \\
-1 &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
\end{bmatrix}
 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
-2 \\
 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that the rows of the [[coefficient matrix]] (corresponding to equations) outnumber the columns (corresponding to unknowns), meaning that the system is overdetermined. The [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of this matrix is 2, which corresponds to the number of [[dependent variables]] in the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stevens|first1=Scott A.|title=System Analysis - Rank and Nullity|url=http://math.bd.psu.edu/faculty/stevens/MATH220/Handouts/Rank%20and%20Nullity.pdf|website=Math 220 - Matrices Handouts|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A linear system is consistent [[if and only if]] the coefficient matrix has the same rank as its [[augmented matrix]] (the coefficient matrix with an extra column added, that column being the column vector of constants). The augmented matrix has rank 3, so the system is inconsistent. The [[kernel (linear algebra)|nullity]] is 0, which means that the [[null space]] contains only the zero vector and thus has no [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].

In [[linear algebra]] the concepts of [[row space]], [[column space]] and [[null space]] are important for determining the properties of matrices. The informal discussion of constraints and [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] above relates directly to these more formal concepts.
{{Clear}}

==Homogeneous case==
The homogeneous case (in which all constant terms are zero) is always consistent (because there is a trivial, all-zero solution). There are two cases, depending on the number of linearly dependent equations: either there is just the [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] solution, or there is the trivial solution plus an infinite set of other solutions.

Consider the system of linear equations: ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0  for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''M'', and variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, where each ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a weighted sum of the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;s. Then ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ... = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 is always a solution. When ''M'' &lt; ''N'' the system is ''underdetermined'' and there are always an infinitude of further solutions. In fact the dimension of the space of solutions is always at least ''N'' &amp;minus; ''M''.

For ''M'' ≥ ''N'', there may be no solution other than all values being 0. There will be an infinitude of other solutions only when the system of equations has enough dependencies (linearly dependent equations) that the number of independent equations is at most ''N'' &amp;minus; 1. But with ''M'' ≥ ''N'' the number of independent equations could be as high as ''N'', in which case the trivial solution is the only one.

==Non-homogeneous case==
In systems of linear equations, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;=''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''M'', in variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; the equations are sometimes linearly dependent; in fact the number of linearly independent equations cannot exceed ''N''+1. We have the following possible cases for an overdetermined system with ''N'' unknowns and ''M'' equations (''M''&gt;''N'').
* ''M'' = ''N''+1 and all M equations are [[linearly independent]]. This case yields no solution. Example: ''x'' = 1, ''x'' = 2. 
* ''M'' &gt; ''N'' but only ''K'' equations (''K'' &lt; ''M'' and ''K'' ≤ ''N''+1) are linearly independent. There exist three possible sub-cases of this:
**''K'' = ''N''+1. This case yields no solutions. Example: 2''x'' = 2, ''x'' = 1, ''x'' = 2.
**''K'' = ''N''. This case yields  either a single solution or no solution, the latter occurring when the coefficient vector of one equation can be replicated by a weighted sum of the coefficient vectors of the other equations but that weighted sum applied to the constant terms of the other equations does not replicate the one equation's constant term. Example with one solution: 2''x'' = 2, ''x'' = 1. Example with no solution: 2''x'' + 2''y'' = 2, ''x'' + ''y'' = 1, ''x'' + ''y'' = 3.
**''K'' &lt; ''N''. This case yields either infinitely many solutions or no solution, the latter occurring as in the previous sub-case. Example with infinitely many solutions: 3''x'' + 3''y'' = 3, 2''x'' + 2''y'' = 2, ''x'' + ''y'' = 1. Example with no solution: 3''x'' + 3''y'' + 3''z'' = 3, 2''x'' + 2''y'' + 2''z'' = 2, ''x'' + ''y'' + ''z'' = 1, ''x'' + ''y'' + ''z'' = 4.

These results may be easier to understand by putting the [[augmented matrix]] of the coefficients of the system in [[row echelon]] form by using [[Gaussian elimination]]. This row echelon form is the augmented matrix of a system of equations that is equivalent to the given system (it has exactly the same solutions). The number of independent equations in the original system is the number of non-zero rows in the echelon form. The system is inconsistent (no solution) if and only if the last non-zero row in echelon form has only one non-zero entry that is in the last column (giving an equation 0 = c where c is a non-zero constant). Otherwise, there is exactly one solution when the number of non-zero rows in  echelon form is equal to the number of unknowns, and there are infinitely many solutions when the number of non-zero rows is lower than the number of variables.

Putting it another way, according to the [[Rouché–Capelli theorem]], any system of equations (overdetermined or otherwise) is inconsistent if the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the augmented matrix is greater than the rank of the [[coefficient matrix]]. If, on the other hand, the ranks of these two matrices are equal, the system must have at least one solution. The solution is unique if and only if the rank equals the number of variables. Otherwise the general solution has ''k'' free parameters where ''k'' is the difference between the number of variables and the rank; hence in such a case there are an infinitude of solutions.

==Exact solutions==

All exact solutions can be obtained, or it can be shown that none exist, using [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix algebra]]. See [[System of linear equations#Matrix solution]].

==Approximate solutions==

The method of [[ordinary least squares]] can be used to find an approximate solution to overdetermined systems. For the system &lt;math&gt;Ax = b,&lt;/math&gt; the least squares formula is obtained from the problem

:&lt;math&gt;\min_{x}\Vert Ax - b \Vert,&lt;/math&gt;

the solution of which can be written with the [[normal equations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1=Howard | last1=Anton | first2=Chris | last2=Rorres,| title= Elementary Linear Algebra | edition=9th | year=2005 | publisher= John Wiley and Sons, Inc. | isbn=978-0-471-66959-3}}

where &lt;math&gt;{\mathrm{T}}&lt;/math&gt; indicates a [[matrix transpose]], ''provided'' &lt;math&gt;(A^{\mathrm{T}}A)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; exists (that is, provided ''A'' has full [[matrix rank|column rank]]). With this formula an approximate solution is found when no exact solution exists, and it gives an exact solution when one does exist.
However, to achieve good numerical accuracy, using the [[QR factorization]] of ''A'' to solve the least squares problem is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Numerical Linear Algebra | first1=Lloyd | last1=Trefethen | first2=David | last2=Bau, III | year=1997 | isbn=978-0898713619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In general use==

The concept can also be applied to more general systems of equations, such as [[systems of polynomial equations]] or [[partial differential equations]]. In the case of the systems of polynomial equations, it may happen that an overdetermined system has a solution, but that no one equation is a consequence of the others and that, when removing any equation, the new system has more solutions. For example, &lt;math&gt;(x-1)(x-2)=0, (x-1)(x-3)=0&lt;/math&gt; has the single solution &lt;math&gt;x=1,&lt;/math&gt; but each equation by itself has two solutions.

[[Image:Pert chart colored.svg|thumb|309px|PERT network chart for a seven-month project with five [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] (10 through 50) and six activities (A through F).]]

The '''program '''(or '''project''') '''evaluation and review technique''' ('''PERT''') is a statistical tool used in [[project management]], which was designed to analyze and represent the [[task (project management)|tasks]] involved in completing a given [[project]]. 

First developed by the [[United States Navy]] in the 1950s, it is commonly used in conjunction with the [[critical path method]] (CPM).

== Overview ==
Project Evaluation and Review Techniques is commonly abbreviated to PERT.
PERT is a method of analyzing the tasks involved in completing a given project, especially the time needed to complete each task, and to identify the minimum time needed to complete the total project. It incorporates uncertainty by making it possible to schedule a project while not knowing precisely the details and [[Duration (project management)|durations]] of all the activities. It is more of an event-oriented technique rather than start- and completion-oriented, and is used more in projects where time is the major factor rather than cost. It is applied to very large-scale, one-time, complex, non-routine infrastructure and Research and Development projects.

Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) offers a management tool, which relies "on arrow and node diagrams of ''activities'' and ''events'': arrows represent the ''activities'' or work necessary to reach the ''events'' or nodes that indicate each completed phase of the total project."&lt;ref name="MB 1968"/&gt;

PERT and CPM are complementary tools, because "CPM employs one time estimate and one cost estimate for each activity; PERT may utilize three time estimates (optimistic, expected, and pessimistic) and no costs for each activity. Although these are distinct differences, the term PERT is applied increasingly to all critical path scheduling."&lt;ref name="MB 1968"/&gt;

==History==
"PERT" was developed primarily to simplify the planning and scheduling of large and complex projects. It was developed for the [[United States Navy Special Projects Office|U.S. Navy Special Projects Office]] in 1957 to support the U.S. Navy's Polaris nuclear submarine project.&lt;ref name="MRCW 1959"&gt;Malcolm, D. G., J. H. Roseboom, C. E. Clark, [[Willard Fazar|W. Fazar]]. "Application of a Technique for Research and Development Program Evaluation," ''OPERATIONS RESEARCH,'' Vol. 7, No. 5, September–October 1959, pp. 646–669&lt;/ref&gt; It found applications all over industry. An early example was it was used for the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] in [[Grenoble]] which applied PERT from 1965 until the opening of the 1968 Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1968/or1968.pdf 1968 Winter Olympics official report.] p. 49. Accessed 1 November 2010. {{en icon}} &amp; {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project model was the first of its kind, a revival for [[scientific management]], founded by Frederick Taylor ([[Taylorism]]) and later refined by Henry Ford ([[Fordism]]). [[DuPont]]'s [[critical path method]] was invented at roughly the same time as PERT.

[[File:PERT Summary Report Phase 2, 1958.jpg|thumb|upright|''PERT Summary Report Phase 2'', 1958]]
Initially PERT stood for ''Program Evaluation Research Task,'' but by 1959 was already renamed.&lt;ref name="MRCW 1959"/&gt; It had been made public in 1958 in two publications of the U.S. Department of the Navy, entitled ''Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 1.''&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of the Navy. ''[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/735902.pdf Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 1].'' Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''Phase 2.''&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of the Navy. ''[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100954569 Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 2].'' Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1959 article in  ''The American Statistician'' the main [[Willard Fazar]], Head of the Program Evaluation Branch, Special Projects Office, U.S. Navy, gave a detailed description of the main concepts of the PERT. He explained:

{{Quote|Through an electronic computer, the PERT technique processes data representing the major, finite accomplishments (events) essential to achieve end-objectives; the inter-dependence of those events; and [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]] of time and range of time necessary to complete each activity between two successive events. Such time expectations include estimates of "most likely time", "optimistic time", and "pessimistic time" for each activity. The technique is a management control tool that sizes up the outlook for meeting objectives on time; highlights danger signals requiring management decisions; reveals and defines both methodicalness and slack in the flow plan or the network of sequential activities that must be performed to meet objectives; compares current expectations with [[Schedule (project management)|scheduled]] completion dates and computes the probability for meeting scheduled dates; and simulates the effects of options for decision&amp;nbsp;— before decision.&lt;br /&gt;The concept of PERT was developed by an operations research team staffed with representatives from the Operations Research Department of [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]; the Evaluation Office of the [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems|Lockheed Missile Systems Division]]; and the Program Evaluation Branch, Special Projects Office, of the Department of the Navy.&lt;ref name="SDFJWM 1959"&gt;[[Willard Fazar]] cited in: B. Ralph Stauber, H. M. Douty, Willard Fazar, Richard H. Jordan, William Weinfeld and Allen D. Manvel. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2682310 Federal Statistical Activities]." ''The American Statistician'' 13(2): 9-12 (Apr., 1959) , pp. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:PERT Guide for management use, June 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|''PERT Guide for management use'', June 1963]]
Ten years after the introduction of PERT in 1958 the American [[librarian]] Maribeth Brennan published a selected [[bibliography]] with about 150 publications on PERT and CPM, which had been published between 1958 and 1968. The origin and development was summarized as follows:
{{Quote|PERT originated in 1958 with the... [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris missile]] design and construction scheduling. Since that time, it has been used extensively not only by the [[aerospace industry]] but also in many situations where management desires to achieve an objective or complete a task within a scheduled time and cost expenditure; it came into popularity when the algorithm for calculating a maximum value path was conceived. PERT and CPM may be calculated manually or with a computer, but usually they require major computer support for detailed projects. A number of colleges and universities now offer instructional courses in both.&lt;ref name="MB 1968"&gt;Brennan, Maribeth, ''PERT and CPM: a selected bibliography,''  Monticello, Ill., Council of Planning Librarians, 1968. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the subdivision of work units in PERT&lt;ref&gt;Desmond L. Cook (1966), ''Program Evaluation and Review Technique.'' p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; another tool was developed: the [[Work Breakdown Structure]]. The Work Breakdown Structure provides "a framework for complete networking, the Work Breakdown Structure was formally introduced as the first item of analysis in carrying out basic PERT/COST."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bright Maynard]] (1967), ''Handbook of Business Administration.'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
=== Events and activities ===
In a PERT diagram, the main building block is the ''event'', with connections to its known predecessor events and successor events.
* ''PERT event'': a point that marks the start or completion of one or more activities. It consumes no time and uses no resources. When it marks the completion of one or more activities, it is not "reached" (does not occur) until ''all'' of the activities leading to that event have been completed.
* ''predecessor event'': an event that immediately precedes some other event without any other events intervening. An event can have multiple predecessor events and can be the predecessor of multiple events.
* ''successor event'': an event that immediately follows some other event without any other intervening events. An event can have multiple successor events and can be the successor of multiple events.

Besides events, PERT also knows activities and sub-activities:
* ''PERT activity'': the actual performance of a task which consumes time and requires resources (such as labor, materials, space, machinery). It can be understood as representing the time, effort, and resources required to move from one event to another. A PERT activity cannot be performed until the predecessor event has occurred.
* ''PERT sub-activity'': a PERT activity can be further decomposed into a set of sub-activities. For example, activity A1 can be decomposed into A1.1, A1.2 and A1.3. Sub-activities have all the properties of activities; in particular, a sub-activity has predecessor or successor events just like an activity. A sub-activity can be decomposed again into finer-grained sub-activities.

=== Time ===
PERT has defined four types of time required to accomplish an activity:
* ''optimistic time'': the minimum possible time required to accomplish an activity (o) or a path (O), assuming everything proceeds better than is normally expected
* ''pessimistic time'': the maximum possible time required to accomplish an activity (p) or a path (P), assuming everything goes wrong (but excluding major catastrophes).
* ''most likely time'': the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (m) or a path (M), assuming everything proceeds as normal.
* ''expected time'': the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (te) or a path (TE), accounting for the fact that things don't always proceed as normal (the implication being that the expected time is the average time the task would require if the task were repeated on a number of occasions over an extended period of time).
::: '''te''' =  ('''o''' + '''4m''' + '''p''') ÷ '''6'''
:::&lt;math&gt;TE = \sum_{i=1}^n te_i&lt;/math&gt;
* ''standard deviation of time'' : the variability of the time for accomplishing an activity (σ&lt;sub&gt;te&lt;/sub&gt;) or a path (σ&lt;sub&gt;TE&lt;/sub&gt;)
::: '''σ&lt;sub&gt;te&lt;/sub&gt;''' =  ('''p''' - '''o''') ÷ '''6'''
:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{TE} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n {\sigma_{te_i}}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Management tools ===
PERT supplies a number of tools for management with determination of concepts, such as:
* ''[[Float (project management)|float]] or [[Float (project management)|slack]]'' is a measure of the excess time and resources available to complete a task. It is the amount of time that a project task can be delayed without causing a delay in any subsequent tasks (''free float'') or the whole project (''total float''). Positive slack would indicate ''ahead of schedule''; negative slack would indicate ''behind schedule''; and zero slack would indicate ''on schedule''.
* ''[[critical path method|critical path]]'': the longest possible continuous pathway taken from the initial event to the terminal event. It determines the total calendar time required for the project; and, therefore, any time delays along the critical path will delay the reaching of the terminal event by at least the same amount.
* ''critical activity'': An activity that has total float equal to zero. An activity with zero float is not necessarily on the critical path since its path may not be the longest.
* ''[[wikt:lead#Verb_2|Lead]] time'': the time by which a ''predecessor event'' must be completed in order to allow sufficient time for the activities that must elapse before a specific PERT event reaches completion.
* ''lag time'': the earliest time by which a ''successor event'' can follow a specific PERT event.
* ''[[Critical path method|fast tracking]]'': performing more critical activities in parallel
* ''[[Critical path method|crashing critical path]]'': Shortening duration of critical activities

==Implementation==

The first step to scheduling the project is to determine the tasks that the project requires and the order in which they must be completed.  The order may be easy to record for some tasks e.g.When building a house, the land must be graded before the foundation can be laid) while difficult for others (there are two areas that need to be graded, but there are only enough bulldozers to do one).  Additionally, the time estimates usually reflect the normal, non-rushed time.  Many times, the time required to execute the task can be reduced for an additional cost or a reduction in the quality.

=== Example ===
In the following example there are seven tasks, labeled ''A'' through ''G''.  Some tasks can be done concurrently (''A'' and ''B'') while others cannot be done until their predecessor task is complete (''C'' cannot begin until ''A'' is complete).  Additionally, each task has three time estimates: the optimistic time estimate (''o''), the most likely or normal time estimate (''m''), and the pessimistic time estimate (''p'').  The expected time (''te'') is computed using the formula (''o'' + 4''m'' + ''p'') ÷ 6.

Once this step is complete, one can draw a [[Gantt chart]] or a network diagram.

:[[Image:pert example gantt chart.gif|frame|none|A Gantt chart created using [[Microsoft Project]] (MSP).  Note (1) the [[critical path method|critical path]] is in red, (2) the [[Float (project management)|slack]] is the black lines connected to non-critical activities, (3) since Saturday and Sunday are not work days and are thus excluded from the schedule, some bars on the Gantt chart are longer if they cut through a weekend.]]
:[[Image:Pert example gantt chart.png|frame|none|A Gantt chart created using [[OmniPlan]].  Note (1) the [[critical path method|critical path]] is highlighted, (2) the [[Float (project management)|slack]] is not specifically indicated on task 5 (d), though it can be observed on tasks 3 and 7 (b and f), (3) since weekends are indicated by a thin vertical line, and take up no additional space on the work calendar, bars on the Gantt chart are not longer or shorter when they do or don't carry over a weekend.]]

=== Next step, creating network diagram by hand or by using diagram software ===
A network diagram can be created by hand or by using diagram software.  There are two types of network diagrams, activity on arrow ([[Arrow Diagramming Method|AOA]]) and activity on node ([[Precedence Diagram Method|AON]]).  Activity on node diagrams are generally easier to create and interpret.  To create an AON diagram, it is recommended (but not required) to start with a node named ''start''.  This &lt;nowiki&gt;"activity"&lt;/nowiki&gt; has a duration of zero (0).  Then you draw each activity that does not have a predecessor activity (''a'' and ''b'' in this example) and connect them with an arrow from start to each node.  Next, since both ''c'' and ''d'' list ''a'' as a predecessor activity, their nodes are drawn with arrows coming from ''a''.  Activity ''e'' is listed with ''b'' and ''c'' as predecessor activities, so node ''e'' is drawn with arrows coming from both ''b'' and ''c'', signifying that ''e'' cannot begin until both ''b'' and ''c'' have been completed.  Activity ''f'' has ''d'' as a predecessor activity, so an arrow is drawn connecting the activities.  Likewise, an arrow is drawn from ''e'' to ''g''.  Since there are no activities that come after ''f'' or ''g'', it is recommended (but again not required) to connect them to a node labeled ''finish''.

:[[Image:pert example network diagram.gif|frame|none|A network diagram created using [[Microsoft Project]] (MSP).  Note the [[critical path method|critical path]] is in red.]]

:[[Image:pert example node legend.GIF|frame|right|A node like this one (from [[Microsoft Visio]]) can be used to display the activity name, duration, ES, EF, LS, LF, and slack.]]

By itself, the network diagram pictured above does not give much more information than a Gantt chart; however, it can be expanded to display more information.  The most common information shown is:
# The activity name
# The expected duration time
# The early start time (ES)
# The early finish time (EF)
# The late start time (LS)
# The late finish time (LF)
# The [[float (project management)|slack]]

In order to determine this information it is assumed that the activities and normal duration times are given.  The first step is to determine the ES and EF.  The ES is defined as the maximum EF of all predecessor activities, unless the activity in question is the first activity, for which the ES is zero (0).  The EF is the ES plus the task duration (EF = ES + duration).

*The ES for ''start'' is zero since it is the first activity.  Since the duration is zero, the EF is also zero.  This EF is used as the ES for ''a'' and ''b''.
*The ES for ''a'' is zero.  The duration (4 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of four.  This EF is used as the ES for ''c'' and ''d''.
*The ES for ''b'' is zero.  The duration (5.33 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 5.33.
*The ES for ''c'' is four.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 9.17.
*The ES for ''d'' is four.  The duration (6.33 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 10.33.  This EF is used as the ES for ''f''.
*The ES for ''e'' is the greatest EF of its predecessor activities (''b'' and ''c'').  Since ''b'' has an EF of 5.33 and ''c'' has an EF of 9.17, the ES of ''e'' is 9.17.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 14.34.  This EF is used as the ES for ''g''.
*The ES for ''f'' is 10.33.  The duration (4.5 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 14.83.
*The ES for ''g'' is 14.34.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 19.51.
*The ES for ''finish'' is the greatest EF of its predecessor activities (''f'' and ''g'').  Since ''f'' has an EF of 14.83 and ''g'' has an EF of 19.51, the ES of ''finish'' is 19.51.  ''Finish'' is a milestone (and therefore has a duration of zero), so the EF is also 19.51.

Barring any [[Theory of Constraints|unforeseen events]], the project should take 19.51 work days to complete.  The next step is to determine the late start (LS) and late finish (LF) of each activity.  This will eventually show if there are activities that have [[float (project management)|slack]].  The LF is defined as the minimum LS of all successor activities, unless the activity is the last activity, for which the LF equals the EF.  The LS is the LF minus the task duration (LS = LF − duration).

*The LF for ''finish'' is equal to the EF (19.51 work days) since it is the last activity in the project.  Since the duration is zero, the LS is also 19.51 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''f'' and ''g''.
*The LF for ''g'' is 19.51 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 14.34 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''e''.
*The LF for ''f'' is 19.51 work days.  The duration (4.5 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 15.01 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''d''.
*The LF for ''e'' is 14.34 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 9.17 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''b'' and ''c''.
*The LF for ''d'' is 15.01 work days.  The duration (6.33 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 8.68 work days.
*The LF for ''c'' is 9.17 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 4 work days.
*The LF for ''b'' is 9.17 work days.  The duration (5.33 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 3.84 work days.
*The LF for ''a'' is the minimum LS of its successor activities.  Since ''c'' has an LS of 4 work days and ''d'' has an LS of 8.68 work days, the LF for ''a'' is 4 work days.  The duration (4 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 0 work days.
*The LF for ''start'' is the minimum LS of its successor activities.  Since ''a'' has an LS of 0 work days and ''b'' has an LS of 3.84 work days, the LS is 0 work days.

=== Next step, determination of critical path and possible slack ===
The next step is to determine the [[critical path method|critical path]] and if any activities have [[float (project management)|slack]].  The critical path is the path that takes the '''longest''' to complete.  To determine the path times, add the task durations for all available paths.  Activities that have slack can be delayed without changing the overall time of the project.  Slack is computed in one of two ways, slack = LF − EF ''or'' slack = LS − ES.  Activities that are on the critical path have a slack of zero (0).

*The duration of path ''adf'' is 14.83 work days.
*The duration of path ''aceg'' is 19.51 work days.
*The duration of path ''beg'' is 15.67 work days.

The critical path is ''aceg'' and the critical time is 19.51 work days.  It is important to note that there can be more than one critical path (in a project more complex than this example) or that the critical path can change.  For example, let's say that activities ''d'' and ''f'' take their pessimistic (b) times to complete instead of their expected (T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) times.  The critical path is now ''adf'' and the critical time is 22 work days.  On the other hand, if activity ''c'' can be reduced to one work day, the path time for ''aceg'' is reduced to 15.34 work days, which is slightly less than the time of the new critical path, ''beg'' (15.67 work days).

Assuming these scenarios do not happen, the slack for each activity can now be determined.

*''Start'' and ''finish'' are milestones and by definition have no duration, therefore they can have no slack (0 work days).
*The activities on the critical path by definition have a slack of zero; however, it is always a good idea to check the math anyway when drawing by hand.
** LF&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 4 − 4 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.17 − 9.17 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 14.34 − 14.34 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 19.51 − 19.51 = 0
*Activity ''b'' has an LF of 9.17 and an EF of 5.33, so the slack is 3.84 work days.
*Activity ''d'' has an LF of 15.01 and an EF of 10.33, so the slack is 4.68 work days.
*Activity ''f'' has an LF of 19.51 and an EF of 14.83, so the slack is 4.68 work days.

Therefore, activity ''b'' can be delayed almost 4 work days without delaying the project.  Likewise, activity ''d'' '''or''' activity ''f'' can be delayed 4.68 work days without delaying the project (alternatively, ''d'' and ''f'' can be delayed 2.34 work days each).

== As project scheduling tool ==
=== Advantages ===
*  PERT chart explicitly defines and makes visible [[Dependency (project management)|dependencies]] (precedence relationships) between the work breakdown structure (commonly [[Work breakdown structure|WBS]]) elements.
*  PERT facilitates identification of the critical path and makes this visible.
*  PERT facilitates identification of early start, late start, and slack for each activity.
*  PERT provides for potentially reduced project duration due to better understanding of dependencies leading to improved overlapping of activities and tasks where feasible.
* The large amount of project data can be organized and presented in diagram for use in decision making.
* PERT can provide a probability of completing before a given time.

=== Disadvantages ===
* There can be potentially hundreds or thousands of activities and individual dependency relationships.
* PERT is not easily scalable for smaller projects.
* The network charts tend to be large and unwieldy, requiring several pages to print and requiring specially-sized paper.
* The lack of a timeframe on most PERT/CPM charts makes it harder to show status, although colours can help, ''e.g.'', specific colour for completed nodes.

=== Uncertainty in project scheduling ===

During project execution, however, a real-life project will never execute exactly as it was planned due to uncertainty. This can be due to ambiguity resulting from subjective estimates that are prone to human errors or can be the result of variability arising from unexpected events or risks. The main reason that PERT may provide inaccurate information about the project completion time is due to this schedule uncertainty. This inaccuracy may be large enough to render such estimates as not helpful.

One possible method to maximize solution robustness is to include safety in the baseline schedule in order to absorb the anticipated disruptions. This is called ''proactive scheduling''. A pure proactive scheduling is a utopia; incorporating safety in a baseline schedule which allows for every possible disruption would lead to a baseline schedule with a very large make-span. A second approach, termed ''reactive scheduling'', consists of defining a procedure to react to disruptions that cannot be absorbed by the baseline schedule.

A '''Proof-of-Work''' ('''PoW''') '''system''' (or '''protocol''', or '''function''') is an economic measure to deter [[denial of service]] attacks and other service abuses such as [[spam (electronic)|spam]] on a network by requiring some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer.  The concept was invented by [[Cynthia Dwork]] and [[Moni Naor]] as presented in a 1993 journal article.{{r|"DwoNao1992"}} The term "Proof of Work" or PoW was first coined and formalized in a 1999 paper by [[Markus Jakobsson]] and Ari Juels.{{r|"JaJue1999"}} An early example of the proof-of-work system used to give value to a currency is the [[Shell money#Oceania and Australia|shell money]] of the [[Solomon Islands]]{{citation_needed|date=June 2018}}.

A key feature of these schemes is their asymmetry: the work must be moderately hard (but feasible) on the requester side but easy to check for the service provider. This idea is also known as a CPU cost function, [[Client Puzzle Protocol|client puzzle]], computational puzzle or CPU pricing function. It is distinct from a [[CAPTCHA]], which is intended for a human to solve quickly, rather than a computer. [[Proof of space]] (PoSpace) proposals apply the same principle by proving a dedicated amount of memory or disk space instead of CPU time. Proof-of-Stake, [[Proof of bandwidth]], and other approaches have been discussed in the context of [[cryptocurrency]]. [[Proof of ownership]] aims at proving that specific data are held by the prover.

==Background==
One popular system, used in [[Hashcash]], uses partial hash inversions&lt;!-- *not* hash collisions...  --&gt; to prove that work was done, as a good-will token to send an [[e-mail]]. For instance the following header represents about 2&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt; hash computations to send a message to &lt;code&gt;calvin@comics.net&lt;/code&gt; on [[January 19, 2038]]:

 X-Hashcash: 1:52:380119:calvin@comics.net:::9B760005E92F0DAE

It is verified with a single computation by checking that the [[SHA-1]] hash of the stamp (omit the header name &lt;code&gt;X-Hashcash:&lt;/code&gt; including the colon and any amount of whitespace following it up to the digit '1') begins with 52 binary zeros, that is 13 hexadecimal zeros:{{ref|a}}

 0000000000000756af69e2ffbdb930261873cd71

Whether PoW systems can actually solve a particular denial-of-service issue such as the spam problem is subject to debate;&lt;ref name="LauClay2004"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the system must make sending spam emails obtrusively unproductive for the spammer, but should also not prevent legitimate users from sending their messages. In other words, a genuine user should not encounter any difficulties when sending an email, but an email spammer would have to expend a considerable amount of computing power to send out many emails at once. Proof-of-work systems are being used as a primitive by other more complex cryptographic systems such as [[bitcoin]] which uses a system similar to Hashcash.

==Variants==
There are two classes of proof-of-work protocols.

* '''Challenge-response''' protocols assume a direct interactive link between the requester (client) and the provider (server). The provider chooses a challenge, say an item in a set with a property, the requester finds the relevant response in the set, which is sent back and checked by the provider. As the challenge is chosen on the spot by the provider, its difficulty can be adapted to its current load. The work on the requester side may be bounded if the challenge-response protocol has a known solution (chosen by the provider), or is known to exist within a bounded search space.

[[Image:Proof of Work challenge response.svg|550px|center]]

* '''Solution-verification''' protocols do not assume such a link: as a result, the problem must be self-imposed before a solution is sought by the requester, and the provider must check both the problem choice and the found solution. Most such schemes are unbounded probabilistic iterative procedures such as [[Hashcash]].

[[Image:Proof of Work solution verification.svg|550px|center]]

Known-solution protocols tend to have slightly lower variance than unbounded probabilistic protocols because the variance of a [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|rectangular distribution]] is lower than the variance of a [[Poisson distribution]] (with the same mean).{{Explain|date=February 2018|reason=What is a variance in this context? Why is the known-solution protocol related to a Poisson distribution and not some other distribution?}}  A generic technique for reducing variance is to use multiple independent sub-challenges, as the average of multiple samples will have a lower variance.

There are also fixed-cost functions such as the time-lock puzzle.

Moreover, the underlying functions used by these schemes may be:
* '''CPU-bound''' where the computation runs at the speed of the processor, [[Moore's law|which greatly varies in time]], as well as from high-end server to low-end portable devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20130721202930/http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2009/07/20/how-powerful-was-the-apollo-11-computer/ How powerful was the Apollo 11 computer?], a specific comparison that shows how different classes of devices have different processing power.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Memory-bound'''&lt;ref name="ABuMaWo2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DwoGoNao2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coe2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tro2014"/&gt; where the computation speed is bound by main memory accesses (either latency or bandwidth), the performance of which is expected to be less sensitive to hardware evolution.
* '''Network-bound'''&lt;ref name="Abliz09"/&gt; if the client must perform few computations, but must collect some tokens from remote servers before querying the final service provider. In this sense, the work is not actually performed by the requester, but it incurs delays anyway because of the latency to get the required tokens.

Finally, some PoW systems offer '''shortcut''' computations that allow participants who know a secret, typically a private key, to generate cheap POWs. The rationale is that mailing-list holders may generate stamps for every recipient without incurring a high cost. Whether such a feature is desirable depends on the usage scenario.

==Reusable proof-of-work as e-money ==

Computer scientist [[Hal Finney (cypherpunk)|Hal Finney]] built on the proof-of-work idea, yielding a system that exploited reusable proof of work ("RPOW").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://rpow.net/
 | title =  Reusable Proofs of Work
 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222072154/http://rpow.net/
 | archivedate = December 22, 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of making proofs-of-work reusable for some practical purpose had already been established in 1999.&lt;ref name="JaJue1999"/&gt; Finney's purpose for RPoW was as [[token money]]. Just as a gold coin's value is thought to be underpinned by the value of the raw gold needed to make it, the value of an RPoW token is guaranteed by the value of the real-world resources required to 'mint' a PoW token. In Finney's version of RPoW, the PoW token is a piece of [[Hashcash]].

A website can demand a PoW token in exchange for service. Requiring a PoW token from users would inhibit frivolous or excessive use of the service, sparing the service's underlying resources, such as bandwidth to the [[Internet]], computation, disk space, electricity and administrative overhead.

Finney's RPoW system differed from a PoW system in permitting the random exchange of tokens without repeating the work required to generate them. After someone had "spent" a PoW token at a website, the website's operator could exchange that "spent" PoW token for a new, unspent RPoW token, which could then be spent at some third-party website similarly equipped to accept RPoW tokens. This would save the resources otherwise needed to 'mint' a PoW token. The anti-counterfeit property of the RPoW token was guaranteed by [[Trusted computing|remote attestation]]. The RPoW server that exchanges a used PoW or RPoW token for a new one of equal value uses remote attestation to allow any interested party to verify what software is running on the RPoW server. Since the source code for Finney's RPoW software was published (under a [[BSD licenses|BSD]]-like license), any sufficiently knowledgeable programmer could, by inspecting the code, verify that the software (and, by extension, the RPoW server) never issued a new token except in exchange for a spent token of equal value.

Until 2009, Finney's system was the only RPoW system to have been implemented; it never saw economically significant use.

RPoW is protected by the private keys stored in the [[trusted platform module|trusted platform module (TPM)]] hardware and manufacturers holding TPM private keys. Stealing a TPM manufacturer's key or obtaining the key by examining the TPM chip itself would subvert that assurance.

==Bitcoin-type proof-of-work==
In 2009, the [[Bitcoin]] network went online. Bitcoin is a proof-of-work [[cryptocurrency]] that, like Finney's RPoW, is also based on the [[Hashcash]] PoW. But in Bitcoin double-spend protection is provided by a decentralized P2P protocol for tracking transfers of coins, rather than the hardware trusted computing function used by RPoW. Bitcoin has better trustworthiness because it is protected by computation. Bitcoins are "mined" using the Hashcash proof-of-work function by individual miners and verified by the decentralized nodes in the P2P bitcoin network.

==ASICs and mining pools==
Within the Bitcoin community there are groups working together in [[mining pool]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blockchain.info/pools Overview of the Bitcoin mining pools] on blockchain.info&lt;/ref&gt; Some miners use ASICs ([[Application-Specific Integrated Circuit]]) for PoW.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-an-asic-miner/ What is an ASIC miner] on digitaltrends.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], a '''real point''' is a point in the [[complex projective plane]] with [[homogeneous coordinates]] {{math|(''x'',''y'',''z'')}} for which there exists a nonzero [[complex number]] {{math|''λ''}} such that {{math|''λx''}}, {{math|''λy''}}, and {{math|''λz''}} are all [[real number]]s.

This definition can be widened to a [[complex projective space]] of arbitrary finite dimension as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; (u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n)&lt;/math&gt;

are the homogeneous coordinates of a real point if there exists a nonzero complex number {{math|''λ''}} such that the coordinates of

:&lt;math&gt; (\lambda u_1, \lambda u_2, \ldots, \lambda u_n)&lt;/math&gt;

are all real.

== Context ==

Geometries that are specializations of real projective geometry, such as [[Euclidean geometry]], [[elliptic geometry]] or [[conformal geometry]] may be [[Complexification|complexified]], thus embedding the points of the geometry in a complex projective space, but retaining the identity of the original real space as special.  Lines, planes etc. are expanded to the lines, etc. of the complex projective space.  As with the inclusion of points at infinity and complexification of real polynomials, this allows some theorems to be stated more simply without exceptions and for a more regular algebraic analysis of the geometry.

Viewed in terms of [[homogeneous coordinates]], a real vector space of homogeneous coordinates of the original geometry is complexified.  A point of the original geometric space is defined by an equivalence class of homogeneous vectors of the form {{math|''λu''}}, where {{math|''λ''}} is an nonzero complex value and {{math|''u''}} is a real vector. A point of this form (and hence belongs to the original real space) is called a ''real point'', whereas a point that has been added through the complexification and thus does not have this form is called an ''imaginary point''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6087">In [[mathematics]], the '''Regiomontanus's angle maximization problem''', is a famous [[Maxima and minima|optimization]] problem&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Dörrie,''100 Great Problems of Elementary Mathematics: Their History And Solution'', Dover, 1965, pp. 369–370&lt;/ref&gt; posed by the 15th-century German mathematician Johannes Müller&lt;ref&gt;[[Eli Maor]], ''Trigonometric Delights'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2002, pages 46&amp;ndash;48&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as [[Regiomontanus]]). The problem is as follows:

[[Image:Regiomontanus.problem.png|right|thumb|550px|The two dots at eye level are possible locations of the viewer's eye.]]

: A painting hangs from a wall.  Given the heights of the top and bottom of the painting above the viewer's eye level, how far from the wall should the viewer stand in order to maximize the angle [[subtended angle|subtended]] by the painting and whose vertex is at the viewer's eye?

If the viewer stands too close to the wall or too far from the wall, the angle is small; somewhere in between it is as large as possible.

The same approach applies to finding the optimal place from which to kick a ball in rugby.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Rugby and Mathematics: A Surprising Link among Geometry, the Conics, and Calculus|first1=Troy|last1=Jones|first2=Steven|last2=Jackson|journal=Mathematics Teacher|volume=94|issue=8|pages=649–654|year=2001|url=http://wesclark.com/rrr/rugby_and_math.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For that matter, it is not necessary that the alignment of the picture be at right angles: we might be looking at a window of the Leaning Tower of Pisa or a realtor showing off the advantages of a sky-light in a sloping attic roof.

== Solution by elementary geometry ==

[[Image:Regiomontanus.solution.png|right|thumb|550px]]

There is a unique [[circle]] passing through the top and bottom of the painting and tangent to the eye-level line.  By elementary geometry, if the viewer's position were to move along the circle, [[inscribed angle|the angle subtended by the painting would remain constant]].  All positions on the eye-level line except the point of tangency are outside of the circle, and therefore the angle subtended by the painting from those points is smaller.

By ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''&amp;nbsp;III.36 (alternatively the [[power of a point|power-of-a-point theorem]]), the distance from the wall to the point of tangency is the [[geometric mean]] of the heights of the top and bottom of the painting. This means, in turn, that if we reflect the bottom of the picture in the line at eye-level and draw the circle with the segment between the top of the picture and this reflected point as diameter, the circle intersects the line at eye-level in the required position (by Elements II.14).

== Solution by calculus ==
In the present day, this problem is widely known because it appears as an exercise in many first-year calculus textbooks (for example that of Stewart&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;James Stewart, ''Calculus: Early Transcendentals'', Fifth Edition, Brooks/Cole, 2003, page&amp;nbsp;340, exercise&amp;nbsp;58&lt;/ref&gt;).

Let

: ''a'' = the height of the bottom of the painting above eye level;
: ''b'' = the height of the top of the painting above eye level;
: ''x'' = the viewer's distance from the wall;
: ''&amp;alpha;'' = the angle of elevation of the bottom of the painting, seen from the viewer's position;
: ''&amp;beta;'' = the angle of elevation of the top of the painting, seen from the viewer's position.

The angle we seek to maximize is ''&amp;beta;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;&amp;alpha;''.  The [[trigonometric functions#Sine, cosine and tangent|tangent]] of the angle increases as the angle increases; therefore it suffices to maximize

: &lt;math&gt; \tan(\beta - \alpha) = \frac{\tan\beta - \tan\alpha}{1 + \tan\beta\tan\alpha} = \frac{\frac{b}{x} - \frac{a}{x}}{1 + \frac{b}{x}\cdot\frac{a}{x}} = (b-a)\frac{x}{x^2 + ab}. &lt;/math&gt;

Since ''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a'' is a positive constant, we only need to maximize the fraction that follows it.  Differentiating, we get

: &lt;math&gt; {d \over dx}\left(\frac{x}{x^2 + ab}\right) = \frac{ab - x^2}{(x^2 + ab)^2} \qquad \begin{cases} {} &gt; 0 &amp; \text{if } 0 \le x &lt; \sqrt{ab\,{}}, \\ {} = 0 &amp; \text{if } x = \sqrt{ab\,{}}, \\ {} &lt; 0 &amp; \text{if } x &gt; \sqrt{ab\,{}}. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the angle increases as ''x'' goes from 0 to {{radic|''ab''}} and decreases as ''x'' increases from {{radic|''ab''}}.  The angle is therefore as large as possible precisely when ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{radic|''ab''}}, the [[geometric mean]] of ''a''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''b''.

== Solution by algebra ==

We have seen that it suffices to maximize

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{x}{x^2 + ab}. &lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to ''minimizing'' the reciprocal:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{x^2 + ab}{x} = x + \frac{ab}{x}. &lt;/math&gt;

Observe that this last quantity is equal to

: &lt;math&gt; \left( \sqrt{x} - \sqrt\frac{ab}{x}\, \right)^2 + 2\sqrt{ab\,{}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

{{show

Recall that 
: &lt;math&gt; (u-v)^2 = u^2 - 2uv + v^2. &lt;/math&gt;
Thus when we have ''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, we can add the middle term &amp;minus;2''uv'' to get a perfect square.  We have
: &lt;math&gt; x + \frac{ab}{x}.&lt;/math&gt;
If we regard ''x'' as ''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''ab''/''x'' as ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''u''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;{{radic|''x''}} and ''v''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;{{radic|''ab''/''x''}}, and so
: &lt;math&gt; 2uv = 2\sqrt{x}\sqrt{\frac{ab}{x}} = 2\sqrt{ab\,{}}. &lt;/math&gt;
Thus we have
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x + \frac{ab}{x} &amp; = u^2 + v^2 = \underbrace{\left(u^2 - 2uv + v^2\right)}_\text{a perfect square} + 2uv \\
&amp; = (u - v)^2 + 2uv = \left( \sqrt{x} - \sqrt\frac{ab}{x}\, \right)^2 + 2\sqrt{ab\,{}}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;}}

This is as small as possible precisely when the square is 0, and that happens when ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{radic|''ab''}}.  Alternatively, we might cite this as an instance of the inequality between the arithmetic and geometric means.

A section &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; allows the base space &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to be identified with a subspace &lt;math&gt;s(B)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.]]
[[Image:Vector field.svg|right|thumb|A vector field on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;. A section of a [[tangent vector bundle]] is a vector field.]]

In the [[mathematical]] field of [[topology]], a '''section''' (or '''cross section''')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Dale|last=Husemöller|authorlink=Dale Husemoller| title=Fibre Bundles|publisher=Springer Verlag|year=1994|isbn=0-387-94087-1|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[fiber bundle]] &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverse]] of the projection function &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;  is a fiber bundle over a [[topological space|base space]], &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \pi \colon E \to B&lt;/math&gt;

then a section of that fiber bundle is a [[continuous map]],
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma \colon B \to E &lt;/math&gt;

such that
:&lt;math&gt; \pi(\sigma(x)) = x &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in B &lt;/math&gt;.

A section is an abstract characterization of what it means to be a graph. The graph of a function &lt;math&gt; g\colon B \to Y &lt;/math&gt; can be identified with a function taking its values in the [[Cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt; E = B \times Y &lt;/math&gt;, of &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma(x) = (x,g(x)) \in E, \ \sigma: B\to E &lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt; \pi\colon E \to B &lt;/math&gt; be the projection onto the first factor: &lt;math&gt; \pi(x,y) = x &lt;/math&gt;.  Then a graph is any function &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt; \pi(\sigma(x)) = x &lt;/math&gt;.

The language of fibre bundles allows this notion of a section to be generalized to the case when &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is not necessarily a Cartesian product.  If &lt;math&gt; \pi\colon E \to B &lt;/math&gt; is a fibre bundle, then a section is a choice of point &lt;math&gt; \sigma(x) &lt;/math&gt; in each of the fibres.  The condition &lt;math&gt; \pi(\sigma(x)) = x &lt;/math&gt; simply means that the section at a point &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;  must lie over &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;.  (See image.)

For example, when &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a [[vector bundle]] a section of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the vector space &lt;math&gt; E_x &lt;/math&gt; lying over each point &lt;math&gt;x \in B&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, a [[vector field]] on a [[smooth manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a choice of [[tangent vector]] at each point of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;: this is a ''section'' of the [[tangent bundle]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, a [[1-form]] on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a section of the [[cotangent bundle]].

Sections, particularly of principal bundles and vector bundles, are also very important tools in [[differential geometry]]. In this setting, the base space &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a [[smooth manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be a smooth fiber bundle over &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth manifold and &lt;math&gt;\pi\colon E\to M&lt;/math&gt; is a [[smooth map]]). In this case, one considers the space of '''smooth sections''' of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; over an open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;C^{\infty}(U,E)&lt;/math&gt;. It is also useful in [[geometric analysis]] to consider spaces of sections with intermediate regularity (e.g., &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; sections, or sections with regularity in the sense of [[Hölder condition]]s or [[Sobolev spaces]]).

== Local and global sections ==

Fiber bundles do not in general have such ''global'' sections (consider, for example, the fiber bundle over &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; with fiber &lt;math&gt;F = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}&lt;/math&gt; obtained by taking the [[Möbius strip|Möbius bundle]] and removing the zero section), so it is also useful to define sections only locally. A '''local section''' of a fiber bundle is a continuous map &lt;math&gt;s \colon U \to E&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is an [[open set]] in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi(s(x))=x&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;(U, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[local trivialization]] of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a homeomorphism from &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;U\times F&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fiber bundle|fiber]]), then local sections always exist over &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in bijective correspondence with continuous maps from &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. The (local) sections form a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] over &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; called the '''sheaf of sections''' of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

The space of continuous sections of a fiber bundle &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;C(U,E)&lt;/math&gt;, while the space of global sections of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(E)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(B,E)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Extending to global sections ===

Sections are studied in [[homotopy theory]] and [[algebraic topology]], where one of the main goals is to account for the existence or non-existence of '''global sections'''. An [[Obstruction theory|obstruction]] denies the existence of global sections since the space is too "twisted". More precisely, obstructions "obstruct" the possibility of extending a local section to a global section due to the space's "twistedness". Obstructions are indicated by particular [[characteristic class]]es, which are cohomological classes. For example, a [[principal bundle]] has a global section if and only if it is [[trivial bundle|trivial]]. On the other hand, a [[vector bundle]] always has a global section, namely the [[zero section]]. However, it only admits a nowhere vanishing section if its [[Euler class]] is zero.

==== Generalizations ====

Obstructions to extending local sections may be generalized in the following manner: take a [[topological space]] and form a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] whose objects are open subsets, and morphisms are inclusions. Thus we use a category to generalize a topological space. We generalize the notion of a "local section" using sheaves of [[abelian group]]s, which assigns to each object an abelian group (analogous to local sections).

There is an important distinction here: intuitively, local sections are like "vector fields" on an open subset of a topological space. So at each point, an element of a ''fixed'' vector space is assigned. However, sheaves can "continuously change" the vector space (or more generally abelian group).

This entire process is really the [[global section functor]], which assigns to each sheaf its global section. Then [[sheaf cohomology]] enables us to consider a similar extension problem while "continuously varying" the abelian group. The theory of [[characteristic class]]es generalizes the idea of obstructions to our extensions.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5402">This article describes '''shape analysis''' to analyze and process geometric [[shape]]s. 
The shape analysis described here is related to the [[statistical shape analysis|statistical analysis of geometric shapes]], to shape matching and shape recognition. It applies purely to the geometry of an object, not to the [[structural analysis]] that deals with predicted behaviour of mechanical parts.

==Description==
''Shape analysis'' is the (mostly){{Clarification needed|reason=|date=May 2017}} automatic analysis of geometric shapes, for example using a computer to detect similarly shaped objects in a database or parts that fit together. For a computer to automatically analyze and process geometric shapes, the objects have to be represented in a digital form. Most commonly a [[boundary representation]] is used to describe the object with its boundary (usually the outer shell, see also [[3D model]]). However, other volume based representations (e.g. [[constructive solid geometry]]) or point based representations ([[point cloud]]s) can be used to represent shape.

Once the objects are given, either by modeling ([[computer-aided design]]), by scanning ([[3D scanner]]) or by extracting shape from 2D or 3D images, they have to be simplified before a comparison can be achieved. The simplified representation is often called a ''shape descriptor'' (or fingerprint, signature). These simplified representations try to carry most of the important information, while being easier to handle, to store and to compare than the shapes directly.
A ''complete shape descriptor'' is a representation that can be used to completely reconstruct the original object (for example the [[medial axis]] transform).

==Application fields==
Shape analysis is used in many application fields:
*[[archeology]] for example, to find similar objects or missing parts
*[[architecture]] for example, to identify objects that spatially fit into a specific space
*[[medical imaging]] to understand shape changes related to illness or aid [[surgical planning]]
*[[Virtual reality|virtual environments]] or on the [[3D models|3D model market]] to identify objects for copyright purposes
*security applications such as face recognition
*entertainment industry (movies, games) to construct and process geometric models or animations
*[[computer-aided design]] and [[computer-aided manufacturing]] to process and to compare designs of mechanical parts or design objects.

==Shape descriptors==
Shape descriptors can be classified by their invariance with respect to the transformations allowed in the associated shape definition. Many descriptors are invariant with respect to ''congruency'', meaning that congruent shapes (shapes that could be translated, rotated and mirrored) will have the same descriptor (for example [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] or [[spherical harmonic]] based descriptors or [[Procrustes analysis]] operating on point clouds).

Another class of shape descriptors (called ''intrinsic'' shape descriptors) is invariant with respect to [[isometry]]. These descriptors do not change with different isometric embeddings of the shape. Their advantage is that they can be applied nicely to deformable objects (e.g. a person in different body postures) as these deformations do not involve much stretching but are in fact near-isometric. Such descriptors are commonly based on geodesic distances measures along the surface of an object or on other isometry invariant characteristics such as the [[Laplace-Beltrami operator|Laplace-Beltrami]] [[spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] (see also [[spectral shape analysis]]).

There are other shape descriptors, such as ''graph-based'' descriptors like the [[medial axis]] or the [[Reeb graph]] that capture geometric and/or topological information and simplify the shape representation but can not be as easily compared as descriptors that represent shape as a vector of numbers.

From this discussion it becomes clear, that different shape descriptors target different aspects of shape and can be used for a specific application. Therefore, depending on the application, it is necessary to analyze how well a descriptor captures the features of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14768">In [[mathematics]], the '''viscosity solution''' concept was introduced in the early 1980s by [[Pierre-Louis Lions]] and [[Michael G. Crandall]] as a generalization of the classical concept of what is meant by a 'solution' to a [[partial differential equation]] (PDE).  It has been found that the viscosity solution is the natural solution concept to use in many applications of PDE's, including for example first order equations arising in [[optimal control]] (the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]]), [[differential game]]s (the [[Isaacs equation]]) or front evolution problems,&lt;ref&gt;I. Dolcetta and P. Lions, eds., (1995), ''Viscosity Solutions and Applications.'' Springer, {{isbn|978-3-540-62910-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as second-order equations such as the ones arising in stochastic optimal control or stochastic differential games.

The classical concept was that a PDE
:&lt;math&gt; F(x,u,Du,D^2 u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
over a domain &lt;math&gt;x\in\Omega&lt;/math&gt; has a solution if we can find a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''u''(''x'') continuous and differentiable over the entire domain such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Du&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; D^2 u&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the above equation at every point.

If a scalar equation is degenerate elliptic (defined below), one can define a type of [[weak solution]] called ''viscosity solution''.
Under the viscosity solution concept, ''u'' need not be everywhere differentiable. There may be points where either &lt;math&gt;Du&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; D^2 u&lt;/math&gt; does not exist and yet ''u'' satisfies the equation in an appropriate generalized sense. The definition allows only for certain kind of singularities, so that existence, uniqueness, and stability under uniform limits, hold for a large class of equations.

== Definition ==
There are several equivalent ways to phrase the definition of viscosity solutions. See for example the section II.4 of Fleming and Soner's book&lt;ref&gt;
Wendell H. Fleming, H. M . Soner., eds., (2006), ''Controlled Markov Processes and Viscosity Solutions.'' Springer, {{isbn|978-0-387-26045-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or the definition using semi-jets in the Users Guide.&lt;ref name="CIL"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Crandall | first1=Michael G. | last2=Ishii | first2=Hitoshi | last3=Lions | first3=Pierre-Louis | title=User's guide to viscosity solutions of second order partial differential equations | doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-1992-00266-5 | year=1992 | journal=American Mathematical Society. Bulletin. New Series | issn=0002-9904 | volume=27 | issue=1 | pages=1–67| arxiv=math/9207212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Degenerate elliptic : An equation &lt;math&gt; F(x,u,Du,D^2 u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; in a domain &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; is defined to be ''degenerate elliptic'' if for any two symmetric matrices &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Y-X&lt;/math&gt; is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]], and any values of &lt;math&gt;x \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, we have  the inequality &lt;math&gt; F(x,u,p,X) \geq F(x,u,p,Y) &lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt; -\Delta u = 0 &lt;/math&gt; is degenerate elliptic since in this case, &lt;math&gt; F(x,u,p,X) = -\text{trace}(X) &lt;/math&gt;, and the [[trace (linear algebra) | trace]] of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is the sum of its eigenvalues. Any real first order equation is degenerate elliptic.

; Subsolution : An [[upper semicontinuous]] function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be a ''subsolution'' of a degenerate elliptic equation in the ''viscosity sense'' if for any point &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt; function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(x_0) = u(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi \geq u&lt;/math&gt; in a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt; F(x_0,\phi(x_0),D\phi(x_0),D^2 \phi(x_0)) \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

; Supersolution : A [[lower semicontinuous]] function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be a ''supersolution'' of a degenerate elliptic equation in the ''viscosity sense'' if for any point &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt; function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(x_0) = u(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi \leq u&lt;/math&gt; in a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt; F(x_0,\phi(x_0),D\phi(x_0),D^2 \phi(x_0)) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

; Viscosity solution : A [[continuous function|continuous]] function ''u'' is a ''viscosity solution'' of the PDE if it is both a supersolution and a subsolution.

== Example ==

Consider the boundary value problem &lt;math&gt;|u'(x)| = 1&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;F(u') = |u'| -1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, on &lt;math&gt;(-1,1)&lt;/math&gt; with boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;u(-1) = u(1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;u(x) = 1-|x|&lt;/math&gt; is the unique viscosity solution. To see this, note that the boundary conditions are satisfied, and &lt;math&gt;|u'(x)| = 1&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined on the interior except at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, it remains to show that the conditions for subsolution and supersolution hold at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.

First, suppose that &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is any function differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\phi(0) = u(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi(x) \geq u(x)&lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;. From these assumptions, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\phi(x) - \phi(0) \geq -|x|&lt;/math&gt;. For positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, this inequality implies &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(0)}{x} \geq -1&lt;/math&gt;, using that &lt;math&gt;|x| / x = sgn(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, for &lt;math&gt;x &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^-} \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(0)}{x} \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable, the left and right limits agree and are equal to &lt;math&gt;\phi'(0)&lt;/math&gt;, and we therefore conclude that &lt;math&gt;|\phi'(0)| \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;F(\phi') \leq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a subsolution. Moreover, the fact that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a supersolution holds vacuously, since there is no function &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\phi(0) = u(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi(x) \leq u(x)&lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a viscosity solution.

=== Discussion ===

[[File:Vanishing_viscosity_solutions.svg|thumb|top|right|Family of solutions &lt;math&gt;u_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; converging toward &lt;math&gt;u(x) = 1-|x|&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The previous boundary value problem is an [[Eikonal equation]] in a single spatial dimension with &lt;math&gt;f = 1&lt;/math&gt;, where the solution is known to be the [[signed distance function]] to the boundary of the domain. Note also in the previous example, the importance of the sign of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the viscosity solution to the PDE &lt;math&gt;-F = 0&lt;/math&gt; with the same boundary conditions is &lt;math&gt;u(x) = |x| - 1&lt;/math&gt;. This can be explained by observing that the solution &lt;math&gt;u(x) = 1-|x|&lt;/math&gt; is the limiting solution of the vanishing viscosity problem &lt;math&gt;F(u') = [u']^2 - 1 = \epsilon u''&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; goes to zero, while &lt;math&gt;u(x) = |x| - 1&lt;/math&gt; is the limit solution of the vanishing viscosity problem &lt;math&gt;-F(u') = 1 - [u']^2 = \epsilon u''&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="GB"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Barles | first1=Guy | title=An introduction to the theory of viscosity solutions for first-order hamilton–jacobi equations and applications | year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. One can readily confirm that &lt;math&gt;u_\epsilon(x) = \epsilon [\ln(\cosh(1/\epsilon)) - \ln(\cosh(x/\epsilon))&lt;/math&gt; solves the PDE &lt;math&gt;F(u') = [u']^2 - 1 = \epsilon u''&lt;/math&gt; for each epsilon. Further, the family of solutions &lt;math&gt;u_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; converge toward the solution &lt;math&gt;u = 1-|x|&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; vanishes (see Figure).

== Basic properties ==

The three basic properties of viscosity solutions are ''existence'', ''uniqueness'' and ''stability''.
* The '''uniqueness''' of solutions requires some extra structural assumptions on the equation. Yet it can be shown for a very large class of degenerate elliptic equations.&lt;ref name="CIL"/&gt; It is a direct consequence of the ''comparison principle''. Some simple examples where comparison principle holds are
# &lt;math&gt;u+H(x,\nabla u) = 0&lt;/math&gt; with ''H'' [[uniformly continuous]] in ''x''.
# (Uniformly elliptic case) &lt;math&gt;F(D^2 u, Du, u) = 0&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is Lipschitz with respect to all variables and for every &lt;math&gt;r \leq s &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X \geq Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F(Y,p,s) \geq F(X,p,r) + \lambda ||X-Y||&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;\lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.
* The '''existence''' of solutions holds in all cases where the comparison principle holds and the boundary conditions can be enforced in some way (through [[barrier function]]s in the case of a [[Dirichlet boundary condition]]). For first order equations, it can be obtained using the [[vanishing viscosity]] method &lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Crandall | first1=Michael G. | last2=Lions | first2=Pierre-Louis | title=Viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations | doi=10.2307/1999343 | year=1983 | journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9947 | volume=277 | issue=1 | pages=1–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for most equations using Perron's method.&lt;ref name="I1"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Ishii | first1=Hitoshi | title=Perron's method for Hamilton-Jacobi equations | doi=10.1215/S0012-7094-87-05521-9 | year=1987 | journal=[[Duke Mathematical Journal]] | issn=0012-7094 | volume=55 | issue=2 | pages=369–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="I2"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Ishii | first1=Hitoshi | title=On uniqueness and existence of viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear second-order elliptic PDEs | doi=10.1002/cpa.3160420103 | year=1989 | journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]] | issn=0010-3640 | volume=42 | issue=1 | pages=15–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a generalized notion of boundary condition, ''in the viscosity sense''. The solution to a boundary problem with generalized boundary conditions is solvable whenever the comparison principle holds. &lt;ref name="CIL"/&gt;
* The '''stability''' of solutions in &lt;math&gt;L^\infty&lt;/math&gt; holds as follows: a locally [[uniform convergence|uniform limit]] of a sequence of solutions (or subsolutions, or supersolutions) is a solution (or subsolution, or supersolution). More generally, the notion of viscosity sub- and supersolution is also conserved by half-relaxed limits. &lt;ref name="CIL"/&gt;

== History ==

The term ''viscosity solutions'' first appear in the work of [[Michael G. Crandall]] and [[Pierre-Louis Lions]] in 1983 regarding the Hamilton–Jacobi equation.&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt; The name is justified by the fact that the existence of solutions was obtained by the [[vanishing viscosity]] method. The definition of solution had actually been given earlier by [[Lawrence C. Evans]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="E"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Evans | first1=Lawrence C. | title=On solving certain nonlinear partial differential equations by accretive operator methods | doi=10.1007/BF02762047 | year=1980 | journal=Israel Journal of Mathematics | issn=0021-2172 | volume=36 | issue=3 | pages=225–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the definition and properties of viscosity solutions for the Hamilton–Jacobi equation were refined in a joint work by Crandall, Evans and Lions in 1984.&lt;ref name="CEL"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Crandall | first1=Michael G. | last2=Evans | first2=Lawrence C. | last3=Lions | first3=Pierre-Louis | title=Some properties of viscosity solutions of Hamilton–Jacobi equations | doi=10.2307/1999247 | year=1984 | journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9947 | volume=282 | issue=2 | pages=487–502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a few years the work on viscosity solutions concentrated on first order equations because it was not known whether second order elliptic equations would have a unique viscosity solution except in very particular cases. The breakthrough result came with the method introduced by [[Robert Jensen (mathematician)|Robert Jensen]] in 1988 to prove the comparison principle using a regularized approximation of the solution which has a second derivative almost everywhere (in modern versions of the proof this is achieved with sup-convolutions and [[Alexandrov theorem]]).&lt;ref name="J"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Jensen | first1=Robert | title=The maximum principle for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear second order partial differential equations | doi=10.1007/BF00281780 | year=1988 | journal=Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis | issn=0003-9527 | volume=101 | issue=1 | pages=1–27| bibcode=1988ArRMA.101....1J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years the concept of viscosity solution has become increasingly prevalent in analysis of degenerate elliptic PDE. Based on their stability properties, Barles and Souganidis obtained a very simple and general proof of convergence of finite difference schemes.&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Barles | first1=G. | last2=Souganidis | first2=P. E. | title=Convergence of approximation schemes for fully nonlinear second order equations | year=1991 | journal=Asymptotic Analysis | issn=0921-7134 | volume=4 | issue=3 | pages=271–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further regularity properties of viscosity solutions were obtained, especially in the uniformly elliptic case with the work of [[Luis Caffarelli]].&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Caffarelli | first1=Luis A. | last2=Cabré | first2=Xavier | title=Fully nonlinear elliptic equations | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publications | isbn=978-0-8218-0437-7 | year=1995 | volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viscosity solutions have become a central concept in the study of elliptic PDE.

In the modern approach, the existence of solutions is obtained most often through the Perron method.&lt;ref name="CIL"/&gt; The vanishing viscosity method is not practical for second order equations in general since the addition of artificial viscosity does not guarantee the existence of a classical solution. Moreover, the definition of ''viscosity solutions'' does not involve any viscosity of any kind. The theory of viscosity solutions is completely unrelated to [[Viscous liquid|viscous fluids]]. Thus, it has been suggested that the name ''viscosity solution'' does not represent the concept appropriately. Yet, the name persists because of the history of the subject. Other names that were suggested were ''Crandall–Lions solutions'', in honor to their pioneers, ''&lt;math&gt;L^\infty&lt;/math&gt;-weak solutions'', referring to their stability properties, or ''comparison solutions'', referring to their most characteristic property.

'''Windows Calculator''' is a software [[calculator]] included in all versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

==History==
A simple arithmetic calculator was first included with [[Windows 1.0]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://toastytech.com/guis/win1012.html Windows 1.01 - Graphical User Interface Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Windows 3.0]], a scientific mode was added, which included [[exponent]]s and [[root (math)|roots]], [[logarithm]]s, [[factorial]]-based functions, [[trigonometry]] (supports [[radian]], [[degree (angle)|degree]] and [[gradian]]s angles), base conversions (2, 8, 10, 16), logic operations, [[statistics|statistical]] functions such as single variable statistics and linear regression.

In [[Windows 98]] and later, it uses an [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]] library, replacing the standard [[IEEE]] [[floating point]] library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/25/141253.aspx The Old New Thing Blog: When you change the insides, nobody notices]&lt;/ref&gt; It offers [[bignum]] precision for basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and 32 digits of precision for advanced operations ([[square root]], [[transcendental function]]s). The largest value that can be represented on the Windows Calculator is currently {{nowrap|&lt;10&lt;sup&gt;10,000&lt;/sup&gt;}} and the smallest is {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−9,999&lt;/sup&gt;}}. (Also ! calculates [[Gamma function]]  not just factorial so one can get 4.7!  ).

In [[Windows 2000]], [[digit grouping]] is added. Degree and base settings are added to menu bar.

===Windows 7===
In [[Windows 7]], separate programmer, statistics, unit conversion, date calculation and worksheets modes were added. Tooltips were removed. Furthermore, Calculator's interface was revamped for the first time since its introduction. The base conversion functions were moved to the programmer mode and statistics functions were moved to the statistics mode. Switching between modes does not preserve the current number, clearing it to 0.

In every mode except programmer mode, one can see the history of calculations. The app was redesigned to accommodate [[multi-touch]]. Standard mode behaves as a simple checkbook calculator; entering the sequence &lt;math&gt;6 * 4 + 12 / 4 - 4 * 5&lt;/math&gt; gives the answer 25. In scientific mode, [[order of operations]] is followed while doing calculations (multiplication and division are done before addition and subtraction), which means &lt;math&gt;6 * 4 + 12 / 4 - 4 * 5 = 7&lt;/math&gt;.

In programmer mode, inputting a number in decimal has a lower and upper limit, depending on the data type, and must always be an integer. Data type of number in decimal mode is signed n-bit&lt;ref&gt;Where n is either: 8 for Byte, 16 for Word, 32 for Dword, or 64 for Qword.&lt;/ref&gt; integer when converting from number in hexadecimal, octal, or binary mode.

|}[[File:Windows 8.1 Calculator.png|thumb|[[Windows 8.1]]'s additional Metro-style calculator in standard mode]]
On the right of the main Calculator, one can add a panel with date calculation, unit conversion and worksheets. Worksheets allow one to calculate a result of a chosen field based on the values of other fields. Pre-defined templates include calculating a car's fuel economy (mpg and L/100&amp;nbsp;km),&lt;ref&gt;[http://malektips.com/windows-7-calculate-fuel-economy.html Calculate Fuel Economy - Windows 7 (MalekTips)]&lt;/ref&gt; a vehicle lease, and a mortgage. In pre-beta versions of Windows 7, Calculator also provided a Wages template.

===Windows 8.1===
While the traditional Calculator is still included with [[Windows 8.1]], a [[Metro (design language)|Metro-style]] Calculator is also present, featuring a full-screen interface as well as normal, scientific, and conversion modes.&lt;ref name=pt-81utility&gt;{{cite web|title=Hands-On with Windows 8.1: New Utility Apps|url=http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/hands-windows-81-new-utility-apps|work=Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows 10===
The Calculator in [[Windows 10 editions#Release branches|non-LTSB editions]] of [[Windows 10]] is a [[Universal Windows Platform app]]. In contrast, Windows 10 LTSC (which does not include universal Windows apps) includes the traditional calculator, but which is now named {{code|win32calc.exe}}. Both calculators provide the features of the traditional calculator included with Windows 7, such as a unit conversions for volume, length, weight, temperature, energy, area, speed, time, power, data, pressure and angle, and the history list which the user can clear. 

Both the universal Windows app and LTSB's {{code|win32calc.exe}} register themselves with the system as handlers of a '{{code|calculator:}}' pseudo-protocol.&lt;!-- i.e. both register a programmatic identifier (ProgID) and link to it from their respective 'Capabilities\URLAssociations' registrations (which in turn are pointed to from the {user|machine}\Software\RegisteredApplications registries).--&gt; This registration is similar to that performed by any other well-behaved application when it registers itself as a handler for a filetype (e.g. {{code|.jpg}}) or protocol (e.g. {{code|http:}}).

All Windows 10 editions (both LTSB and non-LTSB) continue to have a {{code|calc.exe}}, which however is just a stub that launches (via ShellExecute) the handler that is associated with the '{{code|calculator:}}' pseudo-protocol. As with any other protocol or filetype, when there are multiple handlers to choose from, users are free to choose which handler they prefer{{mdash}} either via the classic control panel ('Default programs' settings) or the immersive UI settings ('Default Apps' settings) or from the command prompt via {{code|OpenWith calculator:}}.

==Features==
By default, Calculator runs in standard mode, which resembles a four-function calculator. More advanced functions are available in scientific mode, including [[logarithm]]s, [[numerical base]] conversions, some [[logical connective|logical operators]], [[Order of operations|operator precedence]], [[radian]], [[degree (angle)|degree]] and [[gradians]] support as well as simple single-variable [[statistical]] functions. It does not provide support for user-defined functions, [[complex number]]s, storage variables for intermediate results (other than the classic accumulator memory of pocket calculators), automated [[polar coordinates|polar]]-[[cartesian coordinates]] conversion, or support for two-variables statistics.

Calculator supports [[keyboard shortcut]]s; all Calculator features have an associated keyboard shortcut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/keyboard-shortcuts#keyboard-shortcuts=windows-8|title = Keyboard shortcuts|accessdate = 11 March 2013|website = Windows 8 Help|publisher = [[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculator in [[hexadecimal]] mode cannot accept or display a hexadecimal number larger than 16 hex digits. The largest number it can handle is therefore 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (decimal 18,446,744,073,709,551,615). Any calculations in hex mode which exceed this limit will display a result of zero, even if those calculations would succeed in other modes. In particular, [[scientific notation]] is not available in this mode.

==Calculator Plus==
Calculator Plus is a separate application for [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] users that adds a 'Conversion' mode over the Windows XP version of the Calculator. The 'Conversion' mode supports [[unit conversion]] and [[currency conversion]]. Currency exchange rates can be updated using the built-in update feature, which downloads exchange rates from the [[European Central Bank]].

'''Zlil Sela''' is an [[Israel]]i [[mathematician]] working in the area of [[geometric group theory]].
He is a Professor of Mathematics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Sela is known for the solution&lt;ref name="IP"/&gt; of the [[Isomorphism problem for groups|isomorphism problem]] for torsion-free [[word-hyperbolic group]]s and for the solution of the [[Free group|Tarski conjecture]] about equivalence of [[first order theories]] of [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] [[abelian group|non-abelian]] [[free group]]s.&lt;ref name="ICM"/&gt;

==Mathematical contributions==
Sela's early important work was his solution&lt;ref name="IP"&gt;Z. Sela. ''The isomorphism problem for hyperbolic groups. I.'' [[Annals of Mathematics]] (2), vol. 141 (1995), no. 2, pp. 217–283.&lt;/ref&gt; in mid-1990s of the [[Group isomorphism problem|isomorphism problem]] for torsion-free [[word-hyperbolic group]]s. The machinery of group actions on [[real tree]]s, developed by [[Eliyahu Rips]], played a key role in Sela's approach. The solution of the isomorphism problem also relied on the notion of ''canonical representatives'' for elements of hyperbolic groups, introduced by Rips and Sela in a joint 1995 paper.&lt;ref name="RS1"&gt;Z. Sela, and E. Rips. ''Canonical representatives and equations in hyperbolic groups'', [[Inventiones Mathematicae]] vol. 120 (1995), no. 3, pp. 489–512&lt;/ref&gt; The machinery of the canonical representatives allowed Rips and Sela to prove&lt;ref name="RS1"/&gt; algorithmic solvability of finite systems of equations in torsion-free hyperbolic groups, by reducing the problem to solving equations in [[free group]]s where the Makanin-Razborov algorithm can be applied. The technique of canonical representatives was later generalized by Dahmani&lt;ref&gt;François Dahmani.
''Accidental parabolics and relatively hyperbolic groups.''
[[Israel Journal of Mathematics]], vol. 153 (2006), pp. 93–127&lt;/ref&gt; to the case of [[relatively hyperbolic group]]s and played a key role in the solution of the isomorphism problem for ''toral'' relatively hyprbolic groups.&lt;ref&gt;François Dahmani, and Daniel Groves, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/w9ml8r3147q25m33/ ''The isomorphism problem for toral relatively hyperbolic groups''.] [[Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS]], vol. 107 (2008), pp. 211–290&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work on the isomorphism problem Sela also introduced and developed the notion of a JSJ-decomposition for [[word-hyperbolic group]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Z. Sela. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/qn2dqfw0xquukbw0/?p=7370f12b59a04dc7bfb4bcaba1999688&amp;pi=6 ''Structure and rigidity in (Gromov) hyperbolic groups and discrete groups in rank 1 Lie groups. II.''] [[Geometric and Functional Analysis]], vol. 7 (1997), no. 3, pp. 561–593&lt;/ref&gt; motivated by the notion of a [[JSJ decomposition]] for [[3-manifold]]s. A JSJ-decomposition is a representation of a [[word-hyperbolic group]] as the [[Bass-Serre theory|fundamental group of a graph of groups]] which encodes in a canonical way all possible [[Bass-Serre theory#Splittings|splittings]] over [[infinite cyclic group|infinite cyclic]] [[subgroup]]s. The idea of JSJ-decomposition was later extended by Rips and Sela to torsion-free [[finitely presented group]]s&lt;ref&gt;E. Rips, and Z. Sela. ''Cyclic splittings of finitely presented groups and the canonical JSJ decomposition.'' [[Annals of Mathematics]] (2), vol. 146 (1997), no. 1, pp. 53–109&lt;/ref&gt; and this work gave rise a systematic development of the JSJ-decomposition theory with many further extensions and generalizations by other mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Dunwoody, and M. E. Sageev. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/nam80lavmtmfqtjy/ ''JSJ-splittings for finitely presented groups over slender groups.''] [[Inventiones Mathematicae]], vol. 135 (1999), no. 1, pp. 25&amp;nbsp;44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Scott and G. A. Swarup.

H. Bowditch. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/a32707388262615w/?p=451aa393ae91490592dc228ee1208220&amp;pi=0 ''Cut points and canonical splittings of hyperbolic groups.''] [[Acta Mathematica]], vol. 180 (1998), no. 2, pp. 145–186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Fujiwara, and P. Papasoglu, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/y36373n750808761/?p=3e55ed96a38d4737b6c103c1622249de&amp;pi=2 ''JSJ-decompositions of finitely presented groups and complexes of groups.''] [[Geometric and Functional Analysis]], vol. 16 (2006), no. 1, pp. 70–125&lt;/ref&gt; Sela applied a combination of his JSJ-decomposition and [[real tree]] techniques to prove that torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups are [[Hopfian group|Hopfian]].&lt;ref&gt;Zlil Sela, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V1J-3W7XNXH-4&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F1999&amp;_rdoc=4&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235676%231999%23999619997%2387052%23FLT%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=5676&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=10&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=ce8c665a006da066b5f1ee97f02108e2 ''Endomorphisms of hyperbolic groups. I. The Hopf property.'']
[[Topology (journal)|Topology]], vol. 38 (1999), no. 2, pp. 301–321&lt;/ref&gt; This result and Sela's approach were later generalized by others to [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] [[subgroup]]s of hyperbolic groups&lt;ref&gt;Inna Bumagina, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/gk8603578785574n/ ''The Hopf property for subgroups of hyperbolic groups.''] [[Geometriae Dedicata]], vol. 106 (2004), pp. 211–230&lt;/ref&gt; and to the setting of relatively hyperbolic groups.

Sela's most important work came in early 2000s when he produced a solution to a famous [[Free group#Tarski's problems|Tarski conjecture]]. Namely, in a long series of papers,&lt;ref&gt;Z. Sela. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/f2enxtwehw9trx1c/ ''Diophantine geometry over groups. I. Makanin-Razborov diagrams.''] Publications Mathématiques.

[http://www.springerlink.com/content/w076142801040u05/?p=2d33d0052c1749aeb7b127871d580675&amp;pi=1 ''Diophantine geometry over groups. V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Quantifier elimination.

The elementary theory of a free group.''] [[Geometric and Functional Analysis]], vol. 16 (2006), no. 3, pp. 707–730&lt;/ref&gt; he proved that any two non-abelian [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] [[free group]]s have the same [[first-order theory]]. Sela's work relied on applying his earlier JSJ-decomposition and [[real tree]] techniques as well as developing new ideas and machinery of "algebraic geometry" over [[free group]]s.

Sela pushed this work further to study [[first-order theory]] of arbitrary torsion-free [[word-hyperbolic group]]s and to characterize all groups that are elementarily equivalent to (that is, have the same first order theory as) a given torsion-free word-hyperbolic group. In particular, his work implies that if a finitely generated group ''G'' is elementarily equivalent to a [[word-hyperbolic group]] then ''G'' is word-hyperbolic as well.

Sela also proved that the [[first order theory]] of a finitely generated [[free group]] is [[Stable theory|stable]] in the model-theoretic sense, providing a brand-new and qualitatively different source of examples for the [[Stable theory|stability theory]].

An alternative solution for the Tarski conjecture has been presented by [[Olga Kharlampovich]] and [[Alexei Myasnikov]].&lt;ref&gt;O. Kharlampovich, and A. Myasnikov. [http://www.ams.org/era/1998-04-14/S1079-6762-98-00047-X/home.html ''Tarski's problem about the elementary theory of free groups has a positive solution.''] Electronic Research Announcements of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 4 (1998), pp. 101–108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Kharlampovich, and A. Myasnikov. ''Implicit function theorem over free groups.'' Journal of Algebra, vol. 290 (2005), no. 1, pp. 1–203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Kharlampovich, and A. Myasnikov. ''Algebraic geometry over free groups: lifting solutions into generic points.'' Groups, languages, algorithms, pp. 213–318, Contemporary Mathematics, vol. 378, [[American Mathematical Society]], Providence, RI, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Kharlampovich, and A. Myasnikov. ''Elementary theory of free non-abelian groups.'' Journal of Algebra, vol. 302 (2006), no. 2, pp. 451–552&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Sela on first-order theory of free and word-hyperbolic groups substantially influenced the development of [[geometric group theory]], in particular by stimulating the development and the study of the notion of [[limit group]]s and of [[relatively hyperbolic group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Paulin.

==Statement of the bound==
[[File:Zbound.png|right|500px|thumb|The Zyablov bound. For comparison, the GV bound is also plotted.]]

Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be the rate of the outer code &lt;math&gt;C_{out}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; be the relative distance, then the rate of the concatenated codes satisfies the following bound.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R} \geqslant \max\limits_{0 \leqslant r \leqslant 1 - H_q(\delta + \varepsilon)} r \left (1 - {\delta \over {H_q ^{-1}(1 - r) - \varepsilon}} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of the inner code &lt;math&gt;C_{in}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Description==
Let &lt;math&gt;C_{out}&lt;/math&gt; be the outer code, &lt;math&gt;C_{in}&lt;/math&gt; be the inner code.

Consider &lt;math&gt;C_{out}&lt;/math&gt; meets the [[Singleton bound]] with rate of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;C_{out}&lt;/math&gt; has relative distance &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;1 - R.&lt;/math&gt; In order for &lt;math&gt;C_{out} \circ C_{in}&lt;/math&gt; to be an asymptotically good code, &lt;math&gt;C_{in}&lt;/math&gt; also needs to be an asymptotically good code which means, &lt;math&gt;C_{in}&lt;/math&gt; needs to have rate &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and relative distance &lt;math&gt;\delta_{in}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose &lt;math&gt;C_{in}&lt;/math&gt; meets the [[Gilbert-Varshamov bound]] with rate of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and thus with relative distance

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{in} \geqslant H_q ^{-1}(1 - r) - \varepsilon, \qquad \varepsilon&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt;C_{out} \circ C_{in}&lt;/math&gt; has rate of &lt;math&gt;rR&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta = (1 - R) \left (H_q^{-1}(1 - r) - \varepsilon \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

Expressing &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;\delta, r&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R =1- \frac{\delta}{H^{-1}(1-r) - \varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

Then optimizing over the choice of r, we get that rate of the [[Concatenated error correction code]] satisfies,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R} \geqslant \max\limits_{0\leqslant r\leqslant {1- H_q(\delta + \varepsilon)}} r \left ( 1 - {\delta \over {H_q ^{-1}(1 - r) - \varepsilon}} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

This lower bound is called Zyablov bound (the bound of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;1 - H_q (\delta + \varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; is necessary to ensure &lt;math&gt;R&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;). See Figure 2 for a plot of this bound.

Note that the Zyablov bound implies that for every &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a (concatenated) code with rate  &lt;math&gt;R&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Remarks==
We can construct a code that achieves the Zyablov bound in polynomial time. In particular, we can construct explicit asymptotically good code (over some alphabets) in polynomial time.

Linear Codes will help us complete the proof of the above statement since linear codes have polynomial representation. Let Cout be an &lt;math&gt;[N, K]_{Q}&lt;/math&gt; [[Reed-Solomon error correction]] code where &lt;math&gt;N = Q-1&lt;/math&gt; (evaluation points being &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{Q}^* &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;Q = q^k&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;k = \theta(\log N)&lt;/math&gt;.

We need to construct the Inner code that lies on [[Gilbert-Varshamov bound]]. This can be done in two ways

#To perform an exhaustive search on all generator matrices until the required property is satisfied for &lt;math&gt;C_{in}&lt;/math&gt;. This is because Varshamovs bound states that there exists a linear code that lies on Gilbert-Varshamon bound which will take &lt;math&gt;q^{O(kn)}&lt;/math&gt; time. Using &lt;math&gt;k=rn&lt;/math&gt; we get &lt;math&gt;q^{O(kn)}=q^{O(k^{2})}=N^{O(\log N)}&lt;/math&gt;, which is upper bounded by &lt;math&gt;nN^{O(\log nN)}&lt;/math&gt;, a quasi-polynomial time bound.
#To construct &lt;math&gt;C_{in}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;q^{O(n)}&lt;/math&gt; time and use &lt;math&gt;(nN)^{O(1)}&lt;/math&gt; time overall. This can be achieved by using the method of conditional expectation on the proof that random linear code lies on the bound with high probability.

Thus we can construct a code that achieves the Zyablov bound in polynomial time.
