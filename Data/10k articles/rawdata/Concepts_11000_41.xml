The '''Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants''', a 1998 protocol on [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs), is an addition to the 1979 [[Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]] (LRTAP). The Protocol seeks "to control, reduce or eliminate discharge, emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants" in Europe, some former Soviet Union countries, and the United States, in order to reduce their transboundary fluxes so as to protect human health and the environment from adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1979|title=PROTOCOL TO THE 1979 CONVENTION ON LONG-RANGE TRANSBOUNDARY AIR POLLUTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/lrtap/full%20text/1998.POPs.e.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=1–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors and promoters of the Protocol were the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE), which at the time housed 53 different country members and alliance.   The protocol was amended on 18 December 2009, but the amended version has not yet come into force.

As of May 2013, the protocol has been ratified by 31 states and the [[European Union]].

In the United States, the protocol is an executive agreement that does not require Senate approval. However, legislation is needed to resolve inconsistencies between provisions of the protocol and existing U.S. laws (specifically the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] and the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]]).

== Substances ==
The following substances are contained in the CLRTAP POPs Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;UNECE: ''[http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/lrtap/Publications/11-22162-Part-C.pdf Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution 2010]'', p. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The document focuses on a list of 16 substances that have been singled out according to agreed risk criteria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 25, 1998|title=CONVENTION ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN DECISION-MAKING AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/pp/documents/cep43e.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=1–35|via=UNECE}}&lt;/ref&gt; (comprising eleven pesticides, two industrial chemicals and three by-products/contaminants). The Protocol assigned the arrangements for proper disposal of waste products deemed banned and limited, including medical supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/env/lrtap/pops_h1.html|title=Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) - Air Pollution - Environmental Policy - UNECE|website=www.unece.org|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Abatement ab initio''''' is a [[common law]] [[legal doctrine]] that states that the death of a defendant who is appealing a criminal [[conviction]] [[Vacated judgment|vacates]] the conviction.  Abatement ab initio was the subject of two [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions, [[Durham v. United States (1971)|Durham v. United States]] (1971) and [[Dove v. United States]] (1976). The former extended the doctrine to cases where [[certiorari]] was pending and not yet granted, and the latter excluded [[discretionary appeal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/21760-abatement-ab-initio-and-a-crime-victims-right-to Abatement AB Initio and a Crime Victim’s Right to Restitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abatement ab initio was used to overturn the convictions of [[John Salvi]], [[Kenneth Lay]], and [[Aaron Hernandez]].

'''Algorithmic logic''' is a calculus of programs which allows the expression of [[semantic property|semantic properties]] of programs by appropriate logical [[formula]]s. It provides a [[Software framework|framework]] that enables proving the formulas from the [[axiom]]s of program constructs such as assignment, iteration and composition instructions and from the axioms of the data structures in question see {{harvtxt|Mirkowska|Salwicki|1987}}, {{harvtxt|Banachowski|Kreczmar|Mirkowska|Rasiowa|1977}}.

The following diagram helps to locate algorithmic logic among other [[Mathematical logic|logics]].
&lt;math&gt;\qquad \left [\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{Propositional\ logic}\\or \\ \mathrm{Sentential\ calculus} \end{array}\right ]\subset  \left [\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{Predicate\ calculus} \\or \\ \mathrm{First\ order\ logic}\end{array}\right ]  \subset \left [\begin{array}{l}\mathrm{Calculus\ of\ programs}\\or \\ \mbox{Algorithmic logic} \end{array}\right ] &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The formalized language of algorithmic logic (and of algorithmic theories of various data structures) contains three types of well formed expressions: ''[[Term (logic)|Terms]]'' - i.e. expressions denoting operations on elements of data structures, 
''formulas'' - i.e. expressions denoting the relations among elements of data structures,  ''programs'' - i.e. [[algorithm]]s - these expressions describe the computations.
For semantics of terms and formulas consult pages on [[First-order logic|first order logic]] and Tarski's semantic. The meaning of a program &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the set of possible computations of the program.

Algorithmic logic is one of many logics of programs.
Another logic of programs is dynamic logic, see [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]], {{harvtxt|Harel|Kozen|Tiuryn|2000}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2993">In [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]], an '''alief''' is an automatic or habitual [[belief]]-like attitude, particularly one that is in tension with a person's explicit beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/GENAAB |title=Tamar Szabó Gendler, Alief and Belief |publisher=PhilPapers |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a person standing on a transparent balcony may ''believe'' that they are safe, but ''alieve'' that they are [[acrophobia|in danger]]. A person watching a sad movie may ''believe'' that the characters are completely fictional, but their ''aliefs'' may lead them to cry nonetheless. A person who is hesitant to eat fudge that has been formed into the shape of feces, or who exhibits reluctance in drinking from a sterilized [[bedpan]] may ''believe'' that the substances are safe to eat and drink, but may ''alieve'' that they are not.

The term ''alief'' was introduced by [[Tamar Gendler]], a professor of philosophy and cognitive science at [[Yale University]], in a pair of influential articles published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philosophersannual.org/ |title=Philosopher's Annual |publisher=Philosophersannual.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the publication of these original articles, the notion of alief has been utilized by [[Tamar Gendler|Gendler]] and others — including [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]]&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=Paul |date=2011 |title=How Pleasure Works: The New Science of Why We Like What We Like |publisher=W.

[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr circa 1930-edit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The concept of "clear and present danger" is a rationale for the limitation of free speech originated in a majority opinion written in 1919 by Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.]]
'''Clear and present danger''' was a doctrine adopted by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to determine under what circumstances limits can be placed on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] freedoms of speech, press, or assembly. The test was replaced in 1969 with ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]''{{'}}s "[[imminent lawless action]]" test.

==History==
{{See also|First Amendment to the United States Constitution#Speech critical of the government|label 1=First Amendment issues related to speech critical of government}}
Before the 20th century, most free speech issues involved [[prior restraint]].  Starting in the early 1900s, the Supreme Court began to consider cases in which persons were punished 'after'  speaking or publishing.  The primary legal test used in the United States to determine if speech could be criminalized was the  [[bad tendency]] test.&lt;ref name=RCL&gt;Rabban, pp 132&amp;ndash;134, 190&amp;ndash;199.&lt;/ref&gt; Rooted in English [[common law]], the test permitted speech to be outlawed if it had a tendency to harm public welfare.&lt;ref name=RCL/&gt;  One of the earliest cases in which the Supreme Court  addressed punishment after material was published was   1907's ''[[Patterson v. Colorado]]'' in which the Court used the bad tendency test to uphold contempt charges against a newspaper publisher who accused Colorado judges of acting on behalf of local utility companies.&lt;ref name=RCL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Patterson v. Colorado'', 205 U.S. 454 (1907).&lt;br/&gt;Before 1907, most free speech issues addressed prior restraint rather than punishment after speaking.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antiwar protests during World War I gave rise to several important free speech cases related to sedition and inciting violence.  In the 1919 case ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'',  the Supreme Court held that an antiwar activist did not have a First Amendment right to advocate [[draft resistance]].&lt;ref name="Killian, p 1093"&gt;Killian, p 1093.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Schenck v. United States'', 249 U.S. 47 (1919).&lt;/ref&gt;  In his majority opinion, Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] introduced the clear and present danger test, which would become an important concept in First Amendment law; but the ''Schenck'' decision did not formally adopt the test.&lt;ref name="Killian, p 1093"/&gt;  Holmes later wrote that he intended the clear and present danger test to refine, not replace, the bad tendency test.&lt;ref name=Dunlap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabban, pp 285&amp;ndash;286.&lt;/ref&gt;   Although sometimes mentioned in subsequent rulings, the clear and present danger test was never endorsed by the Supreme Court as a test to be used by lower courts when evaluating the constitutionality of legislation that regulated speech.&lt;ref name=K60&gt;Killian, pp 1096, 1100.&lt;br&gt;Currie, David P., ''The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The Second Century, 1888-1986, Volume 2'',  University of Chicago Press, 1994, p 269, {{ISBN|9780226131122}}.&lt;br&gt;Konvitz, Milton Ridvad, ''Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly'', 	Transaction Publishers, 2003, p 304,  {{ISBN|9780765809544}}.&lt;br/&gt;Eastland,  p 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Court adopted the [[imminent lawless action]] test in 1969's ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', 395 U.S. 444 (1969), which some commentators view as a modified version of the clear and present danger test.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a '''clear and present danger''' that they will bring about the substantive evils that the [[United States Congress]] has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree. When a nation is at war, many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight, and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.}}

The Court continued to use the bad tendency test during the early 20th century in cases such as 1919's ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'', which upheld the conviction of antiwar activists who passed out leaflets encouraging workers to impede the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;''Abrams v. United States'', 250 U.S. 616 (1919).&lt;br/&gt;The bad tendency test was also used in ''Frohwerk v. United States'', 249 U.S. 204 (1919); ''Debs v. United States'', 249 U.S. 211 (1919); and  ''Schaefer v. United States'', 251 U.S. 466 (1920).&lt;br/&gt;See Rabban, David, "Clear and Present Danger Test", in ''The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States'', p 183, 2005, {{ISBN|9780195176612}} .&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Abrams'', Holmes and [[Louis Brandeis|Justice Brandeis]] dissented and encouraged the use of the clear and present test, which provided more protection for speech.&lt;ref&gt;Killian, p. 1094.&lt;br/&gt;Rabban, p 346.&lt;br&gt;Redish, p 102.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1925's ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'',  the Court extended the First Amendment  to the states, and upheld the conviction of Gitlow for publishing the "[[Left Wing Manifesto#.22Left Wing Manifesto.22 issued by the Left Wing National Council|Left Wing Manifesto]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Gitlow v. New York'', 268 U.S. 652 (1925).&lt;/ref&gt;    ''Gitlow'' was decided based on the bad tendency test, but the majority decision acknowledged the validity of the clear and present danger test, yet concluded that its use was limited to Schenck-like situations where the speech was not specifically outlawed by the legislature.&lt;ref name=Dunlap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redish, p 102.&lt;br/&gt;Kemper, p 653.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandeis and Holmes again promoted the clear and present danger test, this time in a concurring opinion in 1927's ''[[Whitney v. California]]'' decision.&lt;ref name=Dunlap&gt;Dunlap, William V., "National Security and Freedom of Speech", in Finkelman (vol 1), pp 1072–1074.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Whitney v. California'' 274 U.S. 357 (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;    The majority did not adopt or use the clear and present danger test,  but the concurring opinion encouraged the Court to support greater protections for speech, and it  suggested that  "imminent danger"{{spaced ndash}}a more restrictive wording than "present danger"{{spaced ndash}}should be required before speech can be outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;Redish pp 102&amp;ndash;104.&lt;br/&gt;Killian, p 1095.&lt;/ref&gt;  After ''Whitney'', the bad tendency test continued to be used by the Court in cases such  1931's  ''[[Stromberg v. California]]'', which held that a 1919 California statute banning red flags was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''Stromberg v. California'', 283 U.S. 359 (1931).&lt;br/&gt;Killian, p 1096.&lt;br/&gt;Another case from that era that used the bad tendency test was ''Fiske v. Kansas'', 274 U.S. 380 (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;

The clear and present danger test was invoked by the majority in the 1940 ''[[Thornhill v. Alabama]]'' decision in which a state antipicketing law was invalidated.&lt;ref name=K60/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Thornhill v. Alabama'', 310 U.S. 88  (1940).&lt;/ref&gt;   Although the Court referred to the clear and present danger test in a few decisions following ''Thornhill'',&lt;ref&gt;Including ''[[Cantwell v. Connecticut]]'', 310 U.S. 296 (1940): "When clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic upon the public streets, or other immediate threat to public safety, peace, or order appears, the power of the State to prevent or punish is obvious ... we think that, in the absence of a statute narrowly drawn to define and punish specific conduct as constituting a clear and present danger to a substantial interest of the State, the petitioner's communication, considered in the light of the constitutional guarantees, raised no such clear and present menace to public peace and order as to render him liable to conviction of the common law offense in question."&lt;br/&gt;
And ''[[Bridges v. California]]'', 314 U.S. 252 (1941): "And, very recently [in ''Thornhill''] we have also suggested that 'clear and present danger' is an appropriate guide in determining the constitutionality of restrictions upon expression ...  What finally emerges from the 'clear and present danger' cases is a working principle that the substantive evil must be extremely serious, and the degree of imminence extremely high, before utterances can be punished."&lt;/ref&gt;  the bad tendency test was not explicitly overruled,&lt;ref name=K60/&gt;  and the clear and present danger test  was not applied in several subsequent free speech cases involving incitement to violence.&lt;ref&gt;Antieu, Chester James, ''Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States'', Wm. S. Hein Publishing, 1998, p 219, {{ISBN|9781575884431}}.  Antieu names ''[[Feiner v. New York]]'', 340 U.S. 315 (1951);  ''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'' 315 U.S. 568 (1942);  and ''[[Kovacs v. Cooper]]'', 335 U.S. 77  (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dennis v. United States''===
[[File:Fred m vinson.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson reaffirmed the applicability of the doctrine of "clear and present danger" in upholding the 1950 conviction of Communist Party USA leader Eugene Dennis.]]

In May 1950, one month before the appeals court heard  [[Oral argument in the United States|oral arguments]] in the ''[[Dennis v. United States]]''  case, the Supreme Court ruled on free speech issues in  ''[[American Communications Association v. Douds]]''.  In that case, the Court considered the clear and present danger test, but rejected it as too mechanical and instead introduced a [[balancing test]].&lt;ref&gt;Eastland,  p 47.&lt;br/&gt;Killian, p 1101.&lt;br /&gt;''American Communications Association v. Douds'' 339 U.S. 382 (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal appeals court heard oral arguments in the CPUSA case on June&amp;nbsp;21–23, 1950.   Judge [[Learned Hand]] considered the clear and present danger test, but his opinion adopted a balancing approach similar to that suggested in ''American Communications Association v. Douds''.&lt;ref name=Dunlap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eastland, pp 96, 112&amp;ndash;113.&lt;br/&gt;Sabin, p 79.&lt;br/&gt;O'Brien, pp 7–8.&lt;br/&gt;Belknap (1994), p 222.&lt;br/&gt;Walker, p 187.&lt;br/&gt;Belknap, Michal, ''The Vinson Court: Justices, Rulings, and Legacy'', ABC-CLIO, 2004, p 109, {{ISBN|9781576072011}}.&lt;br/&gt;Kemper, p 655.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendants appealed the Second Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court in ''[[Dennis v. United States]]''.  The 6–2 decision was issued on June 4, 1951, and upheld Hand's decision.  Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson|Fred Vinson's]] opinion stated that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] does not require that the government must wait "until the putsch is about to be executed, the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited" before it interrupts seditious plots.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), p 223. Vinson quoted by Belknap.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, Vinson endorsed the balancing approach used by Judge Hand:&lt;ref name=Dennis&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/341/494/case.html ''Dennis v. United States'' - 341 U.S. 494 (1951)]  Justia. Retrieved March 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Killian, p 1100.&lt;br/&gt;Kemper, pp 654&amp;ndash;655.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Chief Judge Learned Hand ... interpreted the [clear and present danger] phrase as follows: 'In each case, [courts] must ask whether the gravity of the "evil", discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger.' We adopt this statement of the rule. As articulated by Chief Judge Hand, it is as succinct and inclusive as any other we might devise at this time. It takes into consideration those factors which we deem relevant, and relates their significances. More we cannot expect from words.}}

==Importance==
Following ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'', "clear and present danger" became both a public metaphor for [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] speech&lt;ref name="Derrick2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Derrick |first=Geoffrey J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Why the Judiciary Should Protect First Amendment Political Speech During Wartime: The Case for Deliberative Democracy |journal=Lethbridge Undergraduate Research Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages= |year=2007 |url=http://www.lurj.org/article.php/vol2n1/firstamend.xml |issn=1718-8482 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422191505/http://www.lurj.org/article.php/vol2n1/firstamend.xml |archivedate=2008-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tsai |first=Robert L. |authorlink=  |coauthors= |title=Fire, Metaphor, and Constitutional Myth-Making |journal=Georgetown Law Journal |volume=93 |issue= |pages=181–239 |year=2004 |url= |doi= |issn=0016-8092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a standard test in cases before the Court where a United States law limits a citizen's First Amendment rights; the law is deemed to be [[constitutional]] if it can be shown that the language it prohibits poses a "clear and present danger".  However, the "clear and present danger" criterion of the ''Schenck'' decision was replaced in 1969 by ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Brandenburg v. Ohio, {{ussc|395|444|1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the test refined to determining whether the speech would provoke an "[[imminent lawless action]]".

The vast majority{{Who|date=May 2017}} of legal scholars have concluded that in writing the ''Schenck'' opinion, Justice Holmes never meant to replace the "[[bad tendency (legal)|bad tendency]]" test which had been established in the 1868 English case ''[[Hicklin test|R. v. Hicklin]]'' and incorporated into American jurisprudence in the 1904 Supreme Court case ''[[U.S. ex rel. Turner v. Williams]]''{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}. This is demonstrated by the use of the word "tendency" in ''Schenck'' itself, a paragraph in ''Schenck'' explaining that the success of speech in causing the actual harm was not a prerequisite for conviction, and use of the bad-tendency test in the simultaneous ''[[Frohwerk v. United States]]'' and ''[[Debs v. United States]]'' decisions (both of which cite ''Schenck'' without using the words "clear and present danger").

However, a subsequent essay by [[Zechariah Chafee]] titled "Freedom of Speech in War Time" argued despite context that Holmes had intended to substitute clear and present danger for the bad-tendency standard a more protective standard of free speech.&lt;ref name="Chafee1919"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chafee |first=Zechariah |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1919 |month= |title=Freedom of Speech in Wartime |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=32 |issue= 8|pages=932&amp;ndash;973 |doi=10.2307/1327107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bad tendency was a far more ambiguous standard where speech could be punished even in the absence of identifiable danger, and as such was strongly opposed by the fledgling [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and other libertarians of the time.

Having read Chafee's article, Holmes decided to retroactively reinterpret what he had meant by "clear and present danger" and accepted Chafee's characterization of the new test in his dissent in ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'' just six months after ''Schenck''.&lt;ref&gt;''Abrams v. United States'', {{ussc|250|616|1919}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Schenck'', ''Frohwerk'', and ''Debs'' all resulted in unanimous decisions, while ''Abrams'' did not.

===Brandenburg===

For two decades after the ''Dennis'' decision, free speech issues related to advocacy of violence were decided using balancing tests such as the one initially articulated in ''Dennis''.&lt;ref&gt;Including cases such as  ''Konigsberg v. State Bar of California'', 366 U.S. 36 (1961).&lt;br/&gt;Killian, pp 1101&amp;ndash;1103.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, the court established stronger protections for speech in the landmark case ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'',  which held that  "the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action".&lt;ref&gt;''Brandenburg v. Ohio'', 395 U.S. 444 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redish pp 104&amp;ndash;106.&lt;br/&gt;Killian, pp 1109&amp;ndash;1110.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Brandenburg'' is now the standard applied by the Court to  free speech issues related to advocacy of violence.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in cases such as ''Hess v. Indiana'', 414 U.S. 105 (1973).&lt;br/&gt;Redish, p 105.&lt;br/&gt;Kemper, p 653.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22651">'''Compassion fatigue''', also known as '''secondary traumatic stress''' ('''STS'''), is a condition characterized by a gradual lessening of [[compassion]] over time. Scholars who study compassion fatigue note that the condition is common among workers who work directly with victims of disasters, trauma, or illness, especially in the health care industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Professionals in other occupations are also at risk for experiencing compassion fatigue, e.g. attorneys&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;, child protection workers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conrad|first=David|last2=Kellar-Guenther|first2=Yvonne|date=2006|title=Compassion Fatigue, Burnout, and Compassion Satisfaction among Colorado Child Protection Workers|url=|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=30|issue=10|pages=1071–1080|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and veterinarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holcombe|first=T.

Non-workers, such as family members and other informal caregivers of people who are suffering from a chronic illness, may also experience compassion fatigue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Compassion Fatigue: An Application of the Concept to Informal Caregivers of Family Members with Dementia|url = http://www.hindawi.com/journals/nrp/2011/408024/|journal = Nursing Research and Practice|date = 2011-09-08|pmc = 3170786|pmid = 22229086|pages = 1–10|volume = 2011|doi = 10.1155/2011/408024|language = en|first = Jennifer R.|last = Day|first2 = Ruth A.|last2 = Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first diagnosed in nurses in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

People who experience compassion fatigue can exhibit several symptoms including [[hopelessness]], a decrease in experiences of pleasure, constant stress and anxiety, sleeplessness or nightmares, and a pervasive negative [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. This can have detrimental effects on individuals, both professionally and personally, including a decrease in productivity, the inability to focus, and the development of new feelings of incompetency and self-doubt.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transitionsandyou.com/Compassion_Fatigue.pdf |title=Compassion Fatigue - Because You Care |accessdate=February 2007 |work=St. Petersburg Bar Association Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120225541/http://www.transitionsandyou.com/Compassion_Fatigue.pdf |archivedate=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalism analysts argue that news media have caused widespread compassion fatigue in society by saturating newspapers and news shows with decontextualized images and stories of tragedy and suffering. This has caused the public to become desensitized or resistant to helping people who are suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartcenter.org/training/selfstudy/3_photojournalism/04.php| title=Traumatic Stress &amp; The News Audience| accessdate=June 2008 | publisher=[[Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Compassion fatigue has been studied by the field of traumatology, where it has been called the "cost of caring" for people facing emotional pain. 
 
Compassion fatigue has also been called secondary victimization,&lt;ref&gt;Figley, C. (1982). Traumatization and comfort: Close relationships may be hazardous to your health. Keynote presentation at the Conference, Families and close relationships: Individuals in social interaction, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas, February.&lt;/ref&gt; secondary traumatic stress,&lt;ref&gt;Figley, C. R. (1983). Catastrophes: A overview of family reactions. In C. R. Figley and H. I. McCubbin (Eds.), Stress and the Family: Volume II: Coping with Catastrophe. New York: Brunner/Mazel, 3-20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[vicarious traumatization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lisa McCann|first=I.|last2=Pearlman|first2=Laurie Anne|date=1990-01-01|title=Vicarious traumatization: A framework for understanding the psychological effects of working with victims|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jts.2490030110/abstract|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=131–149|doi=10.1002/jts.2490030110|issn=1573-6598}}&lt;/ref&gt; and secondary survivor.&lt;ref&gt;Remer, R., &amp; Elliott, J. E. (1988). Characteristics of secondary victims of sexual assault. International Journal of Family Psychiatry, 9(4), 373-387.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other related conditions are rape-related family crisis&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, C. A. (1989). Rape and the family. ''Treating stress in families'', 257-289.&lt;/ref&gt; and "proximity" effects on female partners of war veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verbosky|first=S. J.|last2=Ryan|first2=D. A.|date=1988|title=Female partners of Vietnam veterans: stress by proximity|journal=Issues in Mental Health Nursing|volume=9|issue=1|pages=95–104|issn=0161-2840|pmid=3356550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compassion fatigue has been called a form of [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] in some literature. However, unlike compassion fatigue, “burnout” is related to chronic tedium in careers and the workplace, rather than exposure to specific kinds of client problems such as trauma.&lt;ref name="a2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = C | year = 2011 | title = Secondary Traumatic Stress in Nurses: A Systematic Review | url = | journal = Archives of Psychiatric Nursing | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 1–10 | doi = 10.1016/j.apnu.2010.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fMRI-rt research suggests the idea of compassion without engaging in real-life trauma is not exhausting itself. According to these, when [[empathy]] was analyzed with compassion through [[neuroimaging]], empathy showed brain region activations where previously identified to be related to pain whereas compassion showed warped neural activations.&lt;ref name="Altruism: Ricard"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ricard |first=Matthieu|title=Altruism: The Power of Compassion to Change Yourself and the World|chapter=IV|chapter-url=http://info-buddhism.com/Empathy-Compassion-Neuroscience-Ricard-Altruism.html|pages=56–64|year=2015|publisher=Brown and Company|isbn=978-0316208246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matthieuricard.org/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDYvMDQvMTBfMjNfNDNfNjIxX0tsaW1lY2tpX0xlaWJlcmdfUmljYXJkX1Npbmdlcl8yMDEzX1NDQU4ucGRmIl1d/Klimecki_Leiberg_Ricard_Singer_2013_SCAN.pdf Differential pattern of functional brain plasticity after compassion and empathy training], Olga M. Klimecki, Susanne Leiberg, Matthieu Ricard, and Tania Singer, Department of Social Neuroscience, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

In academic literature, the more technical term ''secondary traumatic stress disorder'' may be used. The term "compassion fatigue" is considered somewhat [[euphemism|euphemistic]]. Compassion fatigue also carries sociological connotations, especially when used to analyse the behavior of mass donations in response to the media response to disasters. One measure of compassion fatigue is in the ProQOL, or Professional Quality of Life Scale. Another is the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale.

==Risk factors==

Several personal attributes place a person at risk for developing compassion fatigue.  Persons who are overly conscientious, perfectionists,&lt;ref&gt;D’Souza, Egan, &amp; Rees, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and self-giving are more likely to suffer from secondary traumatic stress.  Those who have low levels of social support or high levels of stress in personal life are also more likely to develop STS.  In addition, previous histories of trauma that led to negative [[coping skills]], such as bottling up or avoiding emotions, having small support systems, increase the risk for developing STS.&lt;ref name="a3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meadors | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2008 | title = Compassion Fatigue and Secondary Traumatization: Provider Self Care on the Intensive Care Units for Children | url = | journal = Journal of Pediatric Health | volume = 22 | issue = 1| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organizational attributes in the fields where STS is most common, such as the healthcare field, contribute to compassion fatigue among the workers.  For example, a “culture of silence” where stressful events such as deaths in an intensive-care unit are not discussed after the event is linked to compassion fatigue. Lack of awareness of symptoms and poor training in the risks associated with high-stress jobs can also contribute to high rates of STS.&lt;ref name="a3" /&gt;

==In healthcare professionals==

Between 16% and 85% of [[Health care provider|health care workers]] in various fields develop compassion fatigue.  In one study, approximately 85% of emergency room nurses met the criteria for compassion fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hooper | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = Compassion Satisfaction, Burnout, and Compassion Fatigue Among Emergency Nurses Compared With Nurses in Other Selected Inpatient Specialties | url = | journal = Journal of Emergency Nursing | volume = 36 | issue = 5| pages = 420–427 | doi = 10.1016/j.jen.2009.11.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another study, more than 25% of ambulance paramedics were identified as having severe ranges of post-traumatic symptoms.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;  In addition, 34% of hospice nurses in another study met the criteria for secondary traumatic stress/compassion fatigue.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;

Healthcare professionals experiencing compassion fatigue may find it difficult to continue doing their jobs. They can be exposed to trauma while trying to deal with compassion fatigue, potentially pushing them out of their career field. If they decide to stay, it can negatively affect the therapeutic relationship they have with patients because it depends on forming an empathetic, trusting relationship that could be difficult to make in the midst of compassion fatigue. Because of this, healthcare institutions are placing increased importance on supporting their employees emotional needs so they can better care for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorenson|first=Claire|last2=Bolick|first2=Beth|last3=Wright|first3=Karen|last4=Hamilton|first4=Rebekah|title=An Evolutionary Concept Analysis of Compassion Fatigue|journal=Journal of Nursing Scholarship|language=en|volume=49|issue=5|pages=557–563|doi=10.1111/jnu.12312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caregiver]]s for dependent people can also experience compassion fatigue; this can become a cause of abusive behavior in caring professions. It results from the taxing nature of showing compassion for someone whose [[suffering]] is continuous and unresolvable.  One may still care for the person as required by policy, however, the natural human desire to help them is significantly diminished. This phenomenon also occurs for professionals involved with long-term [[health care]]. It can also occur for loved ones who have [[Institution#Institutionalisation|institutionalized]] family members. These people may develop symptoms of [[clinical depression|depression]], [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]. Those who are [[primary care]] providers for patients with [[terminal illness]]es are at a higher risk of developing these symptoms. In the medical profession, this is often described as "[[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]]": the more specific terms secondary traumatic stress and [[Vicarious traumatization|vicarious trauma]] are also used.  Some professionals may be predisposed to compassion fatigue due to personal trauma.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Mental health professionals are another group that often suffer from compassion fatigue, particularly when they treat those who have suffered extensive trauma.  A study on mental health professionals that were providing clinical services to Katrina victims found that rates of negative psychological symptoms increased in the group.  Of those interviewed, 72% reported experiencing anxiety, 62% experienced increased suspiciousness about the world around them, and 42% reported feeling increasingly vulnerable after treating the Katrina victims.&lt;ref&gt;Culver, L., McKinney, B., Paradise, L. (2011). Mental Health Professionals' Experiences of Vicarious Traumatization in Post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, 16(1), 33-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassion fatigue, or vicarious trauma, refers to the secondary exposure to trauma seen in fields where workers are directly in contact with the sufferer(s). Symptoms manifest as visualizing the event, insomnia, fear, and avoiding anything that can remind someone of what happened. Those caring for people who have experienced trauma can experience a change in how they view the world; they see it more negatively. It can negatively affect the worker's sense of self, of safety, and of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Hook | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Rothenberg | first2 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Quality of life and compassion satisfaction/fatigue and burnout in child welfare workers: A study of the child welfare workers in community based care organizations in Central Florida | url = http://0-search.ebscohost.com.cals.evergreen.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=sih&amp;AN=36917554&amp;site=ehost-live | journal = Social Work &amp; Christianity | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 36–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with a better ability to empathize and be compassionate are at a higher risk of developing compassion fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Figley, C. R. (1995). Compassion fatigue as secondary stress disorder: An overview. Compassion fatigue: coping with secondary traumatic stress disorder in those who treat the traumatized (1-20). New York: Brunner/Mazel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who experience compassion fatigue, or STS, can begin to exhibit patterns where they feel disengaged, inadequate, overwhelmed, parental, undervalued, over-involved, sexualized, or positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betan|first=Ephi|last2=Heim|first2=Amy Kegley|last3=Zittel Conklin|first3=Carolyn|last4=Westen|first4=Drew|date=2005-05-01|title=Countertransference Phenomena and Personality Pathology in Clinical Practice: An Empirical Investigation|url=https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.5.890|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=162|issue=5|pages=890–898|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.5.890|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another name and concept directly tied to compassion fatigue is moral injury. Moral injury in the context of healthcare was directly named in the ''Stat News'' article by Drs. Wendy Dean and Simon Talbot, entitled "Physicians aren’t ‘burning out.’ They’re suffering from moral injury."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/26/physicians-not-burning-out-they-are-suffering-moral-injury/|title=Physicians aren't 'burning out.' They're suffering from moral injury - STAT|date=2018-07-26|work=STAT|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article and concept goes on to explain that physicians (in the United States) are caught in double and triple and quadruple binds between their obligations of electronic health records, their own student loans, the requirements for patient load through the hospital and number of procedures performed – all while working towards the goal of trying to provide the best care and healing to patients possible. However, the systemic issues facing physicians often cause deep distress because the patients are suffering, despite a physician's best efforts. This concept of Moral Injury in healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moralinjury.healthcare/|title=Moral Injury of Healthcare|last=Talbot, Dean|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the expansion of the discussion around compassion fatigue and 'burnout.'

== In lawyers ==

Recent research shows that a growing number of attorneys who work with victims of trauma are exhibiting a high rate of compassion fatigue symptoms. In fact, lawyers are four times more likely to suffer from depression than the general public. They also have a higher rate of [[suicide]] and [[substance abuse]]. Most attorneys, when asked, stated that their formal education lacked adequate training in dealing with trauma. Besides working directly with trauma victims, one of the main reasons attorneys can develop compassion fatigue is because of the demanding case loads, and long hours that are typical to this profession.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

==Prevention==
There is an effort to prepare those in the healthcare professions to combat compassion fatigue through resiliency training. Teaching workers how to relax in stressful situations, be intentional in their duties and work with integrity, find people and resources who are supportive and understand the risks of compassion fatigue, and focus on self-care are all components of this training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=Patricia|last2=Pion|first2=Sarah|last3=Gentry|first3=J. Eric|title=Compassion Fatigue Resiliency Training: The Experience of Facilitators|journal=The Journal of Continuing Education in Nursing|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=83–88|doi=10.3928/00220124-20151217-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal self-care===
[[Stress reduction]] and anxiety management practices have been shown to be effective in preventing and treating STS.  Taking a break from work, participating in breathing exercises, exercising, and other recreational activities all help reduce the stress associated with STS. Conceptualizing one's own ability with self-integration from a theoretical and practice perspective helps to combat criticized or devalued phase of STS.  In addition, establishing clear [[professional boundaries]] and accepting the fact that successful outcomes are not always achievable can limit the effects of STS.&lt;ref name="a4"&gt;Huggard, P. (2003). Secondary Traumatic Stress: Doctors at risk. New Ethicals Journal. http://home.cogeco.ca/~cmc/Huggard_NewEthJ_2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social self-care===
[[Social support]] and emotional support can help practitioners maintain a balance in their worldview.&lt;ref name="pat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/2017-02-27/politically-active-4-tips-for-incorporating-self-care |title=Politically Active? 4 Tips for Incorporating Self-Care, US News |date=27 February 2017 |work=US News |accessdate=5 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maintaining a diverse network of social support, from colleagues to pets, promotes a positive psychological state and can protect against STS.&lt;ref name="a4" /&gt;

'''Critical thinking''' is the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] analysis of [[fact]]s to form a judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766|title=Defining Critical Thinking|publisher=The International Center for the Assessment of Higher Order Thinking (ICAT, US)/Critical Thinking Community|accessdate=2017-03-22|author=Edward M.

==History==
The earliest documentation of critical thinking are the teachings of [[Socrates]] recorded by Plato. Socrates established the fact that one cannot depend upon those in "authority" to have sound knowledge and insight. He demonstrated that persons may have power and high position and yet be deeply confused and irrational. He established the importance of asking deep questions that probe profoundly into thinking before we accept ideas as worthy of belief.

He established the importance of seeking evidence, closely examining reasoning and assumptions, analyzing basic concepts, and tracing out implications not only of what is said but of what is done as well. His method of questioning is now known as "Socratic Questioning" and is the best known critical thinking teaching strategy. In his mode of questioning, Socrates highlighted the need for thinking for clarity and logical consistency. Socrates asked people questions to reveal their irrational thinking or lack of reliable knowledge. Socrates demonstrated that having authority does not ensure accurate knowledge. He established the method of questioning beliefs, closely inspecting assumptions and relying on evidence and sound rationale. Plato recorded Socrates' teachings and carried on the tradition of critical thinking. Aristotle and subsequent Greek skeptics refined Socrates' teachings, using systematic thinking and asking questions to ascertain the true nature of reality beyond the way things appear from a glance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/a-brief-history-of-the-idea-of-critical-thinking/408|title=A Brief History of the Idea of Critical Thinking|website=www.criticalthinking.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates set the agenda for the tradition of critical thinking, namely, to reflectively question common beliefs and explanations, carefully distinguishing beliefs that are reasonable and logical from those that—however appealing to our native egocentrism, however much they serve our vested interests, however comfortable or comforting they may be—lack adequate evidence or rational foundation to warrant belief.

Critical thinking was described by Richard W. Paul as a movement in two waves (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=181–98|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "first wave" of critical thinking is often referred to as 
a 'critical analysis' that is clear, [[rationality|rational]] thinking involving [[critique]]. Its details vary amongst those who [[operational definition|define]] it. According to Barry K. Beyer (1995), critical thinking means making clear, reasoned judgments. During the process of critical thinking, ideas should be reasoned, well thought out, and judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://myweb.wvnet.edu/~jelkins/critproj/overview.html|title = The Critical Thinking Movement: Alternating Currents in One Teacher's Thinking|first=James R. | last=Elkins|accessdate = 23 March 2014 |website =myweb.wvnet.edu |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. National Council for Excellence in Critical Thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org//|title=Critical Thinking Index Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines critical thinking as the "&lt;nowiki&gt;intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.&lt;/nowiki&gt;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766|title=Defining Critical Thinking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Critical Thinking Skills Diagram.jpg|thumb|
Critical Thinking Skills Diagram
]]
In the term '''critical thinking''', the word ''[[wikt:critical|critical]]'', (Grk. κριτικός = ''kritikos'' = "critic") derives from the word '''critic''' and implies a [[critique]]; it identifies the intellectual capacity and the means "of judging", "of judgement", "for judging", and of being "able to discern".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lesley. (ed.) ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' (1993) p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual roots of critical&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dictionary.com/e/critical-thinking/|title=Lexical Investigations: Critical Thinking - Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|date=2013-06-25|work=Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking are as [[Ancient history|''ancient'']] as its etymology, traceable, ultimately, to the [[Teachings and philosophy of Swami Vivekananda|teaching]] practice and vision of '''''[[Socrates]]'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/socrates-9488126|title=Socrates|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,500 years ago who discovered by a method of probing questioning that people could not rationally justify their confident claims to [[Knowledge|knowledge.]]

==Definitions==
Traditionally, critical thinking has been variously defined as follows:
* "The process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information to reach an answer or conclusion"&lt;ref name="reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/critical|title=Critical – Define Critical at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Reasonable, reflective thinking focused on deciding what to believe or do"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.education.illinois.edu/rhennis/SSConcCTApr3.html|title=SSConceptionCT.html|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Purposeful, [[Self-control|self-regulatory]] judgment which results in interpretation, analysis, evaluation, and inference, as well as explanation of the evidential, conceptual, methodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations upon which that judgment is based"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightassessment.com/CT-Resources/Teaching-For-and-About-Critical-Thinking/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts-PDF|format=PDF|last=Facione|first=Peter A.|title=Critical Thinking: What It is and Why It Counts|publisher=insightassessment.com|year=2011|page=26|access-date=4 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729185619/http://www.insightassessment.com/CT-Resources/Teaching-For-and-About-Critical-Thinking/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts-PDF|archive-date=29 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Thinking about one's thinking in a manner designed to organize and clarify, raise the efficiency of, and recognize errors and biases in one's own thinking. Critical thinking is not 'hard' thinking nor is it directed at solving problems (other than 'improving' one's own thinking). Critical thinking is inward-directed with the intent of maximizing the [[rationality]] of the thinker. One does not use critical thinking to solve problems—one uses critical thinking to improve one's process of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, Kirby; letter to Olivetti, Laguna Salada Union School District, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "An appraisal based on careful analytical evaluation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/critical+analysis|title=critical analysis|newspaper=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary critical thinking scholars have expanded these traditional definitions to include qualities, concepts, and processes such as creativity, imagination, discovery, reflection, empathy, connecting knowing, feminist theory, subjectivity, ambiguity, and inconclusiveness.  Some definitions of critical thinking exclude these subjective practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic and rationality==
{{main article|Logic and rationality}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016|reason=need to follow standard wikipedia reference style}}
The ability to reason logically is a fundamental skill of rational agents, hence the study of the form of correct argumentation is relevant to the study of critical thinking.

"First wave" logical [[thinking]] consisted of understanding the connections between two concepts or points in thought. It followed a philosophy where the [[Thought|thinker]] was removed from the train of thought and the connections and the analysis of the connect was devoid of any bias of the thinker. Kerry Walters describes this ideology in his essay Beyond Logicism in Critical Thinking, "A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal (and, to a lesser extent, formal) logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical, abstract, universal, and objective. This model of [[thinking]] has become so entrenched in conventional academic wisdom that many educators accept it as canon".&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt; The adoption of these principals parallels themselves with the increasing reliance on a quantitative understanding of the world.

In the ‘second wave’ of critical thinking, as defined by [[Kerry S. Walters]] (Re-thinking Reason, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;1), many authors moved away from the logocentric mode of critical thinking that the ‘first wave’ privileged, especially in institutions of higher [[learning]]. Walters summarizes logicism as "the unwarranted assumption that good thinking is reducible to logical thinking".&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;

"A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal (and, to a lesser extent, formal) logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical, abstract, universal, and objective."&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;
As the ‘second wave’ took hold, scholars began to take a more inclusive view of what constituted as critical thinking. Rationality and logic are still widely accepted in many circles as the primary examples of critical thinking.

===Deduction, abduction and induction===
{{main|logical reasoning}}
There are three types of [[logical reasoning]] Informally, two kinds of logical reasoning can be distinguished in addition to formal [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]: [[inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[abductive reasoning|abduction]].
* [[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]] is the conclusion of a consequence given premises that logically follow by [[modus ponens]].
  e.g., X is human and all humans have a face so X has a face.
* [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]] is drawing a conclusion from a pattern that is guaranteed by the strictness of the structure to which it applies.
  e.g., The sum of even integers is even.
  2x+2y = 2(x+y); The sum of integers is an integer and x and y are integers, so 2x+2y=2z where z is an integer, thus 2z is an even integer, so the sum of even integers is even.
* [[Abductive reasoning|Abduction]] is drawing a conclusion using a [[heuristic]] that is likely, but not inevitable given some foreknowledge.
  e.g., I observe sheep in a field, and they appear white from my viewing angle, so sheep are white.
       Contrast with the deductive statement:"Some sheep are white on at least one side."
&lt;!--Start copypasta--&gt;

===Critical thinking and rationality===
Kerry S. Walters (Re-thinking Reason, 1994) argues that rationality demands more than just logical or traditional methods of problem solving and analysis or what he calls the "calculus of justification" but also considers "[[cognitive]] acts such as [[imagination]], conceptual creativity, [[intuition]] and insight" (p.&amp;nbsp;63). These "functions" are focused on discovery, on more abstract processes instead of linear, rules-based approaches to problem-solving. The linear and non-sequential mind must both be engaged in the [[rational]] [[mind]].&lt;ref name="Walters1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kerry S. Walters|title=Re-Thinking Reason: New Perspectives in Critical Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfT32n2Hvd0C|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2095-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to critically analyze an argument – to dissect structure and components, thesis and reasons – is essential. But so is the ability to be flexible and consider non-traditional alternatives and perspectives. These complementary functions are what allow for critical thinking to be a practice encompassing imagination and intuition in cooperation with traditional modes of deductive inquiry.&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;

==Functions==
The list of core critical thinking skills includes observation, interpretation, analysis, inference, evaluation, explanation, and [[metacognition]]. According to Reynolds (2011), an individual or group engaged in a strong way of critical thinking gives due consideration to establish for instance:&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Martin (2011). Critical thinking and systems thinking: towards a critical literacy for systems thinking in practice. In: Horvath, Christopher P. and Forte, James M. eds. Critical Thinking. New York: Nova Science Publishers, pp. 37–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evidence through reality
* Context skills to isolate the problem from context
* Relevant criteria for making the judgment well
* Applicable methods or techniques for forming the judgment
* Applicable theoretical constructs for understanding the problem and the question at hand

In addition to possessing strong critical-thinking skills, one must be disposed to engage problems and decisions using those skills. Critical thinking employs not only [[logic]] but broad [[intellect]]ual criteria such as clarity, [[credibility]], [[accuracy]], precision, [[relevance]], depth, [[breadth]], significance, and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first= Elizabeth A., &amp; And Others |year=1995|title= National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identifying College Graduates' Essential Skills in Writing, Speech and Listening, and Critical Thinking.

PUB TYPE - Reports Research/Technical (143) pp. 14–15|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED383255.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
Critical thinking calls for the ability to:
* Recognize problems, to find workable means for meeting those problems
* Understand the importance of prioritization and order of precedence in problem solving
* Gather and marshal pertinent (relevant) information
* Recognize [[unstated assumption]]s and values
* Comprehend and use [[language]] with accuracy, clarity, and [[wikt:discernment|discernment]]
* Interpret data, to appraise evidence and evaluate arguments
* Recognize the existence (or non-existence) of logical relationships between propositions
* Draw warranted conclusions and generalizations
* Put to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives
* Reconstruct one's patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experience
* Render accurate judgments about specific things and qualities in everyday life

In sum:

"A persistent effort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that supports or refutes it and the further conclusions to which it tends."&lt;ref name=glaser&gt;{{Cite book| title=An Experiment in the Development of Critical Thinking| edition=| author=Edward M. Glaser| year=1941| publisher=New York, Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia University| isbn=0-404-55843-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habits or traits of mind==
The habits of [[mind]] that characterize a person strongly disposed toward critical thinking include a desire to follow reason and evidence wherever they may lead, a systematic approach to problem solving, [[inquisitiveness]], even-handedness, and confidence in [[reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identification of the Skills to be Taught, Learned, and Assessed, NCES 94–286, US Dept of Education, Addison Greenwood (Ed), Sal Carrallo (PI). See also, Critical thinking: A statement of expert consensus for purposes of educational assessment and instruction. ERIC Document No. ED 315–423&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a definition analysis by Kompf &amp; Bond (2001), critical thinking involves problem solving, decision making, [[metacognition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/metacognition/teaching_metacognition.html|title=Teaching Metacognition|website=Metacognition|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; rationality, rational thinking, [[reasoning]], [[knowledge]], [[intelligence]] and also a moral component such as reflective thinking. Critical thinkers therefore need to have reached a level of maturity in their development, possess a certain attitude as well as a set of taught skills.

==Research==
Edward M. Glaser proposed that the ability to think critically involves three elements:&lt;ref name=glaser/&gt;

#An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences
#Knowledge of the methods of logical [[inquiry]] and reasoning
#Some skill in applying those methods.
Educational programs aimed at developing critical thinking in children and adult learners, individually or in group problem solving and decision making contexts, continue to address these same three central elements.

The Critical Thinking project at Human Science Lab, [[London]], is involved in scientific study of all major [[educational system]] in prevalence today to assess how the systems are working to promote or impede critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk/research/| title=Research at Human Science Lab |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary cognitive psychology regards human reasoning as a complex process that is both reactive and reflective.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, S.A. (2002) "Two Systems of Reasoning," in ''Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment'', Govitch, Griffin, Kahneman (Eds), Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79679-8}}; ''Thinking and Reasoning in Human Decision Making: The Method of Argument and Heuristic Analysis'', Facione and Facione, 2007, California Academic Press.  {{ISBN|978-1-891557-58-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between critical thinking skills and critical thinking dispositions is an empirical question. Some people have both in abundance, some have skills but not the disposition to use them, some are disposed but lack strong skills, and some have neither. A measure of critical thinking dispositions is the California Measure of Mental Motivation&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OT12dZ0binIC&amp;pg=PA46 ''Research on Sociocultural Influences on Motivation and Learning''], p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Catherine, M.|date=2007|title=California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory: Further Factor Analytic Examination|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pms.104.1.141-151|journal=SAGE|volume=104|pages=141–151|via=SAGE|doi=10.2466/pms.104.1.141-151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CriTT is an alternative measure that examines student beliefs and attitudes about critical thinking&lt;ref&gt;Stupple, E.

Development of the Critical Thinking Toolkit (CriTT): A measure of student attitudes and beliefs about critical thinking. Thinking Skills and Creativity, 23, 91-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[John Dewey]] is one of many educational leaders who recognized that a curriculum aimed at building thinking skills would benefit the individual learner, the community, and the entire democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1910). ''How we think.'' Lexington, MA: D.C. Heath &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking is significant in academics due to being significant in learning. Critical thinking is significant in the learning process of [[internalization]], in the construction of basic ideas, principles, and theories inherent in content.  And critical thinking is significant in the learning process of application, whereby those ideas, principles, and theories are implemented effectively as they become relevant in learners' lives.

Each discipline adapts its use of critical thinking concepts and principles. The core concepts are always there, but they are embedded in subject-specific content. For students to learn content, intellectual engagement is crucial. All students must do their own thinking, their own construction of knowledge. Good teachers recognize this and therefore focus on the questions, readings, activities that stimulate the mind to take ownership of key concepts and principles underlying the subject.

Historically, teaching of critical thinking focused only on logical procedures such as formal and informal logic. This emphasized to students that good thinking is equivalent to logical thinking. However, a second wave of critical thinking, urges educators to value conventional techniques, meanwhile expanding what it means to be a critical thinker. In 1994, Kerry Walters&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Kerry. (1994). ''Re-Thinking Reason''. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; compiled a conglomeration of sources surpassing this logical restriction to include many different authors’ research regarding connected knowing, empathy, gender-sensitive ideals, collaboration, world views, intellectual autonomy, morality and enlightenment. These concepts invite students to incorporate their own perspectives and experiences into their thinking.

In the English and Welsh school systems, ''Critical Thinking'' is offered as a subject that 16- to 18-year-olds can take as an [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]]. Under the [[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]], students can sit two exam papers for the AS: "Credibility of Evidence" and "Assessing and Developing Argument". The full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is now available: in addition to the two AS units, candidates sit the two papers "Resolution of Dilemmas" and "Critical Reasoning". The A-level tests candidates on their ability to think critically about, and analyze, arguments on their deductive or inductive validity, as well as producing their own arguments. It also tests their ability to analyze certain related topics such as credibility and ethical decision-making. However, due to its comparative lack of subject content, many universities do not accept it as a main A-level for admissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html Critical Thinking FAQs from Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411150135/http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html |date=11 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the AS is often useful in developing reasoning skills, and the full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is useful for degree courses in politics, philosophy, history or [[theology]], providing the skills required for critical analysis that are useful, for example, in biblical study.

There used to also be an [[Advanced Extension Award]] offered in Critical Thinking in the UK, open to any A-level student regardless of whether they have the Critical Thinking A-level. [[Cambridge International Examinations]] have an A-level in Thinking Skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/uppersec/alevel/subject/aleveldetails?assdef_id=765_804|title=Cambridge International AS and A Level subjects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008, [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance]] has also been offering an A-level Critical Thinking specification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php "New GCEs for 2008"], Assessment and Qualifications Alliance {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217221100/http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php |date=17 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]] have also modified theirs for 2008. Many examinations for university entrance set by universities, on top of A-level examinations, also include a critical thinking component, such as the [[LNAT]], the [[UKCAT]], the [[BioMedical Admissions Test]] and the [[Thinking Skills Assessment]].

In [[Qatar]], critical thinking was offered by [[AL-Bairaq]]—an outreach, non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on [[STEM fields]]. The idea behind [[AL-Bairaq]] is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at Qatar University. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |accessdate=5 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |title=

===Efficacy===
In 1995, a meta-analysis of the literature on teaching effectiveness in higher [[education]] was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Lion Gardiner, Redesigning Higher Education: Producing Dramatic Gains in Student Learning, in conjunction with: ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
The study noted concerns from higher [[education]], [[politician]]s, and [[business]] that higher education was failing to meet society's requirements for well-educated citizens.  It concluded that although faculty may aspire to develop students' [[thinking]] skills, in practice they have tended to aim at facts and concepts utilizing lowest levels of [[cognition]], rather than developing intellect or [[values]].

In a more recent meta-analysis, researchers reviewed 341 quasi- or true-experimental studies, all of which used some form of standardized critical thinking measure to assess the outcome variable.&lt;ref name="Abrami, P. C. 2014"&gt;Abrami, P. C., Bernard, R. M., Borokhovski, E., Waddington, D. I., Wade, C. A., &amp; Persson, T. (2014). Strategies for Teaching Students to Think Critically: A Meta-Analysis. Review of Educational Research, 1–40&lt;/ref&gt; The authors describe the various methodological approaches and attempt to categorize the differing assessment tools, which include standardized tests (and second-source measures), tests developed by teachers, tests developed by researchers, and tests developed by teachers who also serve the role as the [[researcher]].  The results emphasized the need for exposing students to real-world problems and the importance in encouraging open dialogue within a supportive environment.  Effective strategies for teaching critical thinking are thought to be possible in a wide variety of [[educational]] settings.&lt;ref name="Abrami, P. C. 2014"/&gt; One attempt to assess the [[humanities]]' role in teaching critical thinking and reducing belief in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims was made at [[North Carolina State University]]. Some success was noted and the researchers emphasized the value of the humanities in providing the skills to evaluate current events and qualitative data in context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink1=Kendrick Frazier |title=Humanities, Too: In New Study, History Courses in Critical Thinking Reduce Pseudoscientific Beliefs |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Lilienfeld]] notes that there is some evidence to suggest that basic critical thinking skills might be successfully taught to children at a younger age than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lilienfeld |first1=Scott |authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld |title=Teaching Skepticism: How Early Can We Begin? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=30-31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/teaching_skepticism_how_early_can_we_begin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810182835/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/teaching_skepticism_how_early_can_we_begin |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2018-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance in academia==
Critical thinking is an important element of all professional fields and academic disciplines (by referencing their respective sets of permissible questions, evidence sources, criteria, etc.). Within the framework of [[scientific skepticism]], the process of critical thinking involves the careful acquisition and interpretation of information and use of it to reach a [[theory of justification|well-justified]] conclusion. The concepts and principles of critical thinking can be applied to any context or case but only by reflecting upon the nature of that application. Critical thinking forms, therefore, a system of related, and overlapping, modes of thought such as anthropological thinking, sociological thinking, historical thinking, political thinking, [[psychological]] thinking, philosophical thinking, mathematical thinking, chemical thinking, biological thinking, ecological thinking, legal thinking, ethical thinking, musical thinking, thinking like a painter, sculptor, engineer, business person, etc. In other words, though critical thinking principles are universal, their application to disciplines requires a process of reflective [[contextualism|contextualization]].

Critical thinking is considered important in the academic fields because it enables one to analyze, evaluate, explain, and restructure their thinking, thereby decreasing the risk of adopting, acting on, or thinking with, a false belief. However, even with knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning, mistakes can happen due to a thinker's inability to apply the methods or because of character traits such as [[egocentrism]]. Critical thinking includes identification of [[prejudice]], [[bias]], propaganda, self-deception, distortion, [[misinformation]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/fallacy/biases.php |title=[F08] Cognitive biases |last1=Lau |first1=Joe |last2=Chan |first2=Jonathan |date= |website=Critical thinking web |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given research in [[cognitive psychology]], some [[education|educators]] believe that schools should focus on teaching their students critical thinking [[skill]]s and cultivation of intellectual traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/critical-thinking-moral-integrity-and-citizenship-teaching-for-the-intellectual-virtues/487 |title=Critical Thinking, Moral Integrity and Citizenship |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Criticalthinking.org |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking skills can be used to help nurses during the assessment process. Through the use of critical thinking, nurses can question, evaluate, and reconstruct the nursing care process by challenging the established theory and practice. Critical thinking skills can help nurses problem solve, reflect, and make a conclusive decision about the current situation they face. Critical thinking creates "new possibilities for the development of the nursing knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Catching the wave: understanding the concept of critical thinking (1999) {{DOI|10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.00925.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the sociocultural, environmental, and political issues that are affecting healthcare delivery, it would be helpful to embody new techniques in nursing. Nurses can also engage their critical thinking skills through the Socratic method of dialogue and reflection. This practice standard is even part of some regulatory organizations such as the College of Nurses of Ontario – Professional Standards for Continuing Competencies (2006).&lt;ref&gt;College of Nurses of Ontario – Professional Standards for 
[http://www.cno.org/Global/4-LearnAboutStandardsAndGuidelines/prac/learn/modules/profstands/slides/Competence.pdf Continuing Competencies (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;
It requires nurses to engage in [[Reflective Practice]] and keep records of this continued professional development for possible review by the College.

Critical thinking is also considered important for [[human rights education]] for [[toleration]]. The [[International Day for Tolerance|Declaration of Principles on Tolerance]] adopted by [[UNESCO]] in 1995 affirms that "education for tolerance could aim at countering factors that lead to fear and exclusion of others, and could help young people to develop capacities for independent judgement, ''critical thinking'' and ethical [[reasoning]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=UNESCO |title=International Day for Tolerance . Declaration of Principles on Tolerance, Article 4, 3 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13175&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking is used as a way of deciding whether a claim is true, partially true, or false. It is a tool by which one can come about reasoned conclusions based on a reasoned process.

==In computer-mediated communication==
The advent and rising popularity of online courses has prompted some to ask if computer-mediated communication (CMC) promotes, hinders, or has no effect on the amount and quality of critical thinking in a course (relative to face-to-face communication). There is some evidence to suggest a fourth, more nuanced possibility: that CMC may promote some aspects of critical thinking but hinder others. For example, Guiller et al. (2008)&lt;ref name="Guiller2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guiller|first1=Jane|last2=Durndell|first2=Alan|last3=Ross|first3=Anne|title=Peer interaction and critical thinking: Face-to-face or online discussion?|journal=Learning and Instruction|date=2008|volume=18|pages=187–200|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, relative to face-to-face discourse, online discourse featured more justifications, while face-to-face discourse featured more instances of students expanding on what others had said. The increase in justifications may be due to the asynchronous nature of online discussions, while the increase in expanding comments may be due to the spontaneity of ‘real time’ discussion. Newman et al. (1995)&lt;ref name="Newman1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=D R|last2=Webb|first2=Brian|last3=Cochrane|first3=Clive|title=A content analysis method to measure critical thinking in face-to-face and computer supported group learning|journal=Interpersonal Computing and Technology|date=1995|volume=3|issue=September 1993|pages=56–77|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04569.x|pmid=18352969}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed similar differential effects. They found that while CMC boasted more important statements and linking of ideas, it lacked novelty. The authors suggest that this may be due to difficulties participating in a brainstorming-style activity in an asynchronous environment. Rather, the asynchrony may promote users to put forth “considered, thought out contributions.”

Researchers assessing critical thinking in online discussion forums often employ a technique called Content Analysis,&lt;ref name="Newman1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guiller2008" /&gt; where the text of online discourse (or the transcription of face-to-face discourse) is systematically coded for different kinds of statements relating to critical thinking. For example, a statement might be coded as “Discuss ambiguities to clear them up” or “Welcoming outside knowledge” as positive indicators of critical thinking. Conversely, statements reflecting poor critical thinking may be labeled as “Sticking to prejudice or assumptions” or “Squashing attempts to bring in outside knowledge.” The frequency of these codes in CMC and face-to-face discourse can be compared to draw conclusions about the quality of critical thinking.

Searching for evidence of critical thinking in discourse has roots in a definition of critical thinking put forth by Kuhn (1991),&lt;ref name="Kuhn1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuhn|first1=D|title=The skills of argument|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasizes the social nature of discussion and knowledge construction. There is limited research on the role of social experience in critical thinking development, but there is some evidence to suggest it is an important factor. For example, research has shown that 3- to 4-year-old children can discern, to some extent, the differential creditability&lt;ref name="Koenig2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=M A|last2=Harris|first2=P L|title=Preschoolers mistrust ignorant and inaccurate speakers|journal=Child Development|date=2005|volume=76|pages=1261–77|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00849.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expertise&lt;ref name="Lutz2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lutz|first1=D J|last2=Keil|first2=F C|title=Early understanding of the division of cognitive labor|journal=Child Development|date=2002|volume=73|pages=1073–84|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00458}}&lt;/ref&gt; of individuals. Further evidence for the impact of social experience on the development of critical thinking skills comes from work that found that 6- to 7-year-olds from China have similar levels of skepticism to 10- and 11-year-olds in the United States.&lt;ref name="Heyman2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyman|first1=G D|last2=Fu|first2=G|last3=Lee|first3=K|title=Evaluating claims peoplemake about themselves: The development of skepticism|journal=Child Development|date=2007|volume=78|pages=367–75|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01003.x|pmc=2570105}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the development of critical thinking skills was solely due to maturation, it is unlikely we would see such dramatic differences across cultures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1611">'''Dialectica spaces''' are a [[category theory|categorical]] way of constructing  models of [[linear logic]].

They were introduced by [[Valeria de Paiva]], [[Martin Hyland]]'s student, in her doctoral thesis, as a way of modeling both linear logic and [[Gödel]]'s [[dialectica interpretation]]&amp;mdash;hence the name.

Given a [[category (category theory)|category]] ''C'' and a specific object ''K'' of ''C'' with certain (logical) properties, one can construct the category of Dialectica spaces over ''C'', whose objects are  pairs of objects of ''C'',  related by a ''C''-[[morphism]] into the given object. Morphisms of Dialectica spaces are similar to [[Chu space]] morphisms, but instead of an equality condition, they have an inequality condition, which is read as a [[logical consequence|logical implication]], the first object implies the second.

[[Image:Yyjpg.svg|thumb|Dialectical Monism]]

'''Dialectical monism''', also known as '''dualistic monism''', is an [[ontology|ontological]] position that holds that reality is ultimately a unified whole, distinguishing itself from [[monism]] by asserting that this whole necessarily expresses itself in [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DANIELS_2011|Daniels 2011]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=ANPyln0ogD4C&amp;pg=PA260#v=onepage p.260]&lt;/ref&gt; For the dialectical monist, the essential unity is that of complementary polarities, which, while opposed in the realm of experience and perception, are co-substantial in a [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] sense.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

== Principles ==

To establish its premises, dialectical monism may posit a [[Universal Dialectic]], which is seen as the fundamental principle of [[existence]]. The concept is similar to that of the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] or "Supreme Ultimate" in Taoism, the "Purusha-Prakriti" in [[Samkhya]], and duality-in-unity of Shiva-Shakti in [[Tantra]]. Advocates assert that [[Taoism]] as well as some forms of [[Buddhism]] are based on an approach [[consistent]] with or identical to dialectical monism.

Ideas relating to "[[teleology|teleological]] evolution" are important in some [[progressivism|progressive]] interpretations of dialectical monism. However, this element has not always been present historically, and is generally not present in contemporary dialectical monisms such as Taoism. It is important to note that teleological tendencies in dialectical monism can significantly differ from other variants of teleology if dialectical progression is linked to [[materialism]], because such an interpretation is a [[Philosophical naturalism|naturalistic]] progression rather than a result of [[Intelligent design|design]] or [[consciousness]]. However, non-materialistic philosophies exist that also are dialectical monisms, such as [[Actual Idealism]].

Some variants of dialectical monism adhere to the view that all conditions exist at all times in unity, and our consciousness separates them into dualistic forms. Other views maintain that the nature of dialectical synthesis dictates that the flow of change will tend toward a "spiral-shaped progression" rather than a perpetual non-progressive (repetitive) circling of history. For these dialectical monists, this explains the fact of physical [[self-organization]] in Nature, as well as the observed tendency for human societies to achieve gradual "progress" over time. These teleological variants may be referred to as "progressive dialectical monism."

As a [[monism]], dialectical monism is opposed to traditional [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] despite its emphasis on "twoness." In dialectical monism, the appearance of duality is seen as arising from the mind's need to impose divisions and boundaries upon an essentially unified whole. Thus, for the dialectical monist, reality is ultimately one but can only be ''experienced'' in terms of division.

Furthermore, dialectical monism might also be termed "plural monism," for it recognizes the [[dependent origination|dependently originated]] existence of a multiplicity of entities, which Taoism calls "the ten thousand things." Dialectical monism does not deny that the plurality of things in existence are "real," but points out that physical reality itself is mind-dependent. (see [[Taoism]] and [[Zen]]).

== History ==

Dialectical monism has been mentioned in Western literature, although infrequently. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] used the term on at least one occasion. Sartre may have used the term "dialectical monism" to when inferring what he saw as absurd in the dogma of a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] non-dualistic interpretation of the dialectic, in which any oppositional view point was claimed to be non-dialectical rather than part of the dialectic itself.

Although the term has never been used outside the West, advocates maintain {{who|date=May 2012}} that dialectical monism has a much greater presence in Eastern traditions. A wide number of Taoist sources are cited, especially those that relate to the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] or [[yin and yang]] concepts. In addition, several Buddhist works are seen as containing strong elements of dialectical monism.

=== Buddhist influences ===

The [[Heart Sutra]] provides a notable expression of dialectical monism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Form is emptiness; emptiness also is form. Emptiness is no other than form; form is no other than emptiness."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, it is sometimes held that the Buddhist elements of dialectical monism are more accurately characterized as [[nondualism|non-dualistic]] since they deny any fundamental sort of creative principle or "one thing," such as that posited by dialectical monism. See the Buddhist philosophy of [[Shunyata|emptiness]].

In response, dialectical monists might reply that theirs is a "positive expression of nondualism," as opposed to the "negative" expression implied by the qualifier ''non'' in nondualism.

[[Nagarjuna]], principal developer of the emptiness doctrine in Buddhism, had a perspective consistent with a broad dialectical monism that was based on the following statement attributed to the Buddha:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"By and large, Kaccayana, this world is supported by a polarity, that of existence and non-existence. But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment, 'non-existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment, 'existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one."
 - Saṃyutta Nikāya 12:15&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Western influences ===
==== Pre-Socratic ====

[[Heraclitus]] is a notable early exception to the Eastern monopoly on dialectical monism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"By cosmic rule, as day yields night, so winter summer, war peace, plenty famine. All things change. Fire penetrates the lump of myrrh, until the joining bodies die and rise again in smoke called incense." (fragment 36) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Men do not know how that which is drawn in different directions harmonises with itself. The harmonious structure of the world depends upon opposite tension like that of the bow and the lyre."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Post-Socratic ====
&lt;blockquote&gt;One must realize that war is shared and Conflict is Justice, and that all things come to pass in accordance with conflict.&lt;br /&gt;— Cited by [[Origen]], ''[[Contra Celsum]]'' VI.28 ''(Diels-Kranz fragment 80)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The way up and down are the same.&lt;br /&gt;— Cited by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], ''[[Refutatio Omnium Haeresium]]'' IX.10.4 ''(Diels-Kranz fragment 60)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is wise, not listening to me but to the report (λόγος), to agree that all things are one.&lt;br /&gt;— Cited by Hippolytus, ''Refutatio'' IX.9.1 ''(Diels-Kranz fragment 50)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Parallels in Aztec philosophy ===

In its article on [[Aztec philosophy]], the ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' describes Aztec ([[Nahua peoples|Nahua]]) metaphysics as a form of dialectical monism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although essentially processive and devoid of any permanent order, the ceaseless becoming of the cosmos is nevertheless characterized by an overarching balance, rhythm, and regularity: one provided by and constituted by ''teotl''... Dialectical polar monism holds that: (1) the cosmos and its contents are substantively and formally identical with ''teotl''; and (2) ''teotl'' presents itself primarily as the ceaseless, cyclical oscillation of polar yet complementary opposites.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Teotl's'' process presents itself in multiple aspects, preeminent among which is duality. This duality takes the form of the endless opposition of contrary yet mutually interdependent and mutually complementary polarities that divide, alternately dominate, and explain the diversity, movement, and momentary arrangement of the universe. These include: being and not-being, order and disorder, life and death, light and darkness, masculine and feminine, dry and wet, hot and cold, and active and passive. Life and death, for example, are mutually arising, interdependent, and complementary aspects of one and the same process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aztec/|title=Aztec Philosophy|author=James Maffie|publisher= Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|issn=2161-0002|date=2005-03-20|accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''Dao De Jing'' references ===

Chapter 42 of the ''[[Tao Te Ching|Dao De Jing]]'' outlines a number-based cosmology that may be consistent with dialectical monism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things. All things leave behind them the Obscurity (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised by the Breath of Vacancy."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations kings and princes use for themselves. So it is that some things are increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being increased."&lt;ref&gt;[[#TSE_2008|Lao-Tse 2008]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=MyRXWwGgb0IC&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage p.42] (alternately from the [[Wikisource]] edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several other chapters (including Chapter 1) make reference to concepts consistent with dialectical monism.

== Contemporary references ==

=== Eastern Philosophy ===


&lt;blockquote&gt;"Really, the fundamental, ultimate mystery - the only thing you need to know to understand the deepest metaphysical secrets - is this: that for every outside there is an inside and for every inside there is an outside, and although they are different, they go together."&lt;ref name=ref_Watts_1999_10&gt;[[#WATTS_1999|Watts 1999]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=GLLFHGoHPJwC&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=%22Really,+the+fundamental,+ultimate+mystery+-+the+only+thing+you+need+to+know+to+understand+the+deepest+metaphysical+secrets+-+is+this:+that+for+every%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=palDUb_BOcjVqQHf54HACw&amp;ved=0CDMQuwUwAA p.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shakespeare ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so." 
— [[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Hamlet]]''. Act II, scene ii 245&lt;/blockquote&gt;As Shakespeare in several places [[Biblical allusions in Shakespeare|borrows directly from the Bible]], he may have been paraphrasing [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean." Romans 14:14&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Thelema ===

In a more contemporary area, the idea of dialectical monism is expressed in the central book of [[Thelema]], ''[[Liber AL vel Legis]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"None... and two. For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all."
— ''[[Liber AL vel Legis]]'', ch. 1, verses 28-30&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The world exists as two, for only so can there be known the Joy of Love, whereby are Two made One. Aught that is One is alone, and has little pain in making itself two, that it may know itself, and love itself, and rejoice therein."
— [[Aleister Crowley]], "The Comment Called D"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Thelema, the transcendent unity is often referred to as "None" or "Nothing":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"By Light shall ye look upon yourselves, and behold All Things that are in Truth One Thing only, whose name hath been called No Thing..."
—[[Aleister Crowley]], ''De Lege Libellum''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... let it be ever thus; that men speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at all, since thou art continuous!"
—''[[Liber AL vel Legis]]'', ch. 1, verse 27&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Sartre on Marxism ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;"'''It is dualist because it is monist'''. Marx’s ontological monism consisted in affirming the irreducibility of Being to thought, and, at the same time, in reintegrating thoughts with the real as a particular form of human activity."&lt;ref&gt;[[#SARTRE_2004|Sartre 2004]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=uIvcQ0EmYpwC&amp;pg=PR22#v=onepage p.xxii]&lt;/ref&gt; 

—Jean-Paul Sartre, ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]'', Vol. 1. Theory of Practical Ensembles&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Sartre's seminal work, the ''Critique of Dialectical Reason'', it is shown how the essential dualism of Marx corresponds to a heightened synthesis, referring to totality, which is the monism that grounds the theses and antitheses of Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SARTRE_2004|Sartre 2004]]: pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=uIvcQ0EmYpwC&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage 15-18] (Chapter 1 ''The Dogmatic Dialectic and the Critical Dialectic'', subsection ''Dualistic Monism'')&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Native American ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Universe, which controls all life, has a female and male balance that prevalent throughout our Sacred Grandmother, the Earth. This balance has to be acknowledged and become the determining factor in all of one’s decisions, be they spiritual, social, healthful, educational or economical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Means|first=Russell|title=Autobiography|url=http://www.russellmeansfreedom.com/about/|accessdate=15 March 2013|authorlink=Russell Means}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecopath with Ecosim''' ('''EwE''') is a free [[ecosystem]] modelling [[software suite]], initially started at [[NOAA]] by Jeffrey Polovina, but has since primarily been developed at the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] of the [[University of British Columbia]]. In 2007, it was named as one of the ten biggest scientific breakthroughs in NOAA's 200-year history. The NOAA citation states that Ecopath "revolutionized scientists' ability worldwide to understand complex marine ecosystems".&lt;ref&gt;NOAA, 2007. ECOPATH Modeling: Precursor to an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management [WWW Document]. URL http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/ecopath/welcome.html (accessed 8.26.12).&lt;/ref&gt; Behind this lie more than two decades of development work in association with [[Villy Christensen]], [[Carl Walters]], [[Daniel Pauly]], and other [[fisheries scientist]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Smikle, S.G., V. Christensen and K.A. Aiken (2010). "A review of caribbean ecosystems and fishery resources using ECOPATH models". Revue Etudes Caribéennes, n°15, https://etudescaribeennes.revues.org/4529&lt;/ref&gt; followed with the provision of user support, training and co-development collaborations. Per January 2012 there are 6000+ registered users in 150+ countries.

In [[aerospace engineering]], especially those areas dealing with [[spacecraft]], the '''eigenvector slew''' is a method to calculate a steering correction (called a '''[[Slew (spacecraft)|slew]]''') by rotating the spacecraft around '''one''' fixed axis, or a [[Gimbal|gimbal]].  This corresponds in general to the fastest and most efficient way to reach the desired target orientation as there is only one acceleration phase and one braking phase for the angular rate. If this fixed axis is not a [[Principal axis (mechanics)|principal axis]] a time varying torque must be applied to force the spacecraft to rotate as desired, though. Also the [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic]] effect of [[momentum wheels]] must be compensated for.

That such a rotation exists corresponds precisely to a main result of the mathematical theory of [[Rotation operator (vector space)|rotation operators]], the (only real) [[eigenvector]] of the rotation operator corresponding to the desired re-orientation is this axis.  

Given the current orientation of the craft, and the desired orientation of the craft in [[cartesian coordinates]], the required [[axis of rotation]] and corresponding rotation angle to achieve the new orientation is determined by computing the eigenvector of the [[Rotation operator (vector space)|rotation operator]]. 

== Problem ==
Let

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}\ ,\ \hat{y}\ ,\  \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;

be a body fixed reference system for a [[3 axis stabilized spacecraft]].  The initial attitude
is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}=\hat{a}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{y}=\hat{b}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{z}=\hat{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

One wants to find an axis relative the spacecraft body

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=r_x \cdot \hat{x} +r_y \cdot \hat{y} +r_z \cdot \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;

and a rotation angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that after the rotation with the angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; one has that

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}=\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{y}=\hat{e}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{z}=\hat{f}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{d}\ ,\ \hat{e}\ ,\  \hat{f}&lt;/math&gt;

are the new target directions.

In vector form this means that

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{d}=r_a \cdot \hat{r} + \cos \alpha \cdot ( \hat{a} - r_a \cdot \hat{r})+
 \sin \alpha \cdot \hat{r} \times \hat{a}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{e}=r_b \cdot \hat{r} + \cos \alpha \cdot ( \hat{b} - r_b \cdot \hat{r})+
 \sin \alpha \cdot \hat{r} \times \hat{b}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{f}=r_c \cdot \hat{r} + \cos \alpha \cdot ( \hat{c} - r_c \cdot \hat{r})+
 \sin \alpha \cdot \hat{r} \times \hat{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Solution ==

In terms of [[linear algebra]] this means that one wants to find an [[eigenvector]] with the [[eigenvalue]] = 1 for the [[linear map]]ping defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a} \longrightarrow \hat{d}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{b} \longrightarrow \hat{e}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{c} \longrightarrow \hat{f}&lt;/math&gt;

which relative to the 

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\ ,\ \hat{b}\ ,\ \hat{c}&lt;/math&gt;

coordinate system has the matrix

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
\langle \hat{d}| \hat{a}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{e}| \hat{a}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{f}| \hat{a} \rangle \\
\langle\hat{d}| \hat{b}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{e}| \hat{b}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{f}| \hat{b}\rangle \\
\langle\hat{d}| \hat{c}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{e}| \hat{c}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{f}| \hat{c}\rangle
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Because this is the matrix of the [[Rotation operator (vector space)|rotation operator]] relative the base vector system &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\ ,\ \hat{b}\ ,\ \hat{c}&lt;/math&gt; the eigenvalue can be determined with the algorithm described in "[[Rotation operator (vector space)]]".

With the notations used here this is:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \alpha=\frac{\langle\hat{d}| \hat{a}\rangle+\langle\hat{e}| \hat{b}\rangle+\langle\hat{f}| \hat{c}\rangle-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_a=\langle\hat{f}| \hat{b}\rangle-\langle\hat{e}| \hat{c}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_b=\langle\hat{d}| \hat{c}\rangle-\langle\hat{f}| \hat{a}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_c=\langle\hat{e}| \hat{a}\rangle-\langle\hat{d}| \hat{b}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\bar{r}|=\sqrt{{r_a}^2+{r_b}^2+{r_c}^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \alpha=\frac{|\bar{r}|}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The rotation angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\operatorname{arg}(\cos \alpha,\sin \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

where "&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{arg}(x\ ,\ y)&lt;/math&gt;" is the polar argument of the vector &lt;math&gt;(\ x\ ,\ y\ )&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the function [[Atan2|ATAN2(y,x)]] (or in [[double precision]] DATAN2(y,x)) available in for example the programming language [[Fortran|FORTRAN]].

The resulting &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; will be in the interval &lt;math&gt;0 \le \alpha \le \pi&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \pi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|\bar{r}| &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and the uniquely defined rotation (unit) vector is:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=\frac{\bar{r}}{|\bar{r}|}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that
 
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\hat{d}| \hat{a}\rangle +\langle\hat{e}| \hat{b}\rangle+\langle\hat{f}| \hat{c}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the matrix defined by the orthogonal linear mapping and that the components of the "[[eigenvector]]" are fixed and constant during the rotation, i.e.
 
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{r}=r_x \cdot \hat{x}(t) +r_y \cdot \hat{y}(t) +r_z \cdot \hat{z}(t)=
r_x \cdot \hat{a} +r_y \cdot \hat{b} +r_z \cdot \hat{c}=
r_x \cdot \hat{d} +r_y \cdot \hat{e} +r_z \cdot \hat{f}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}\ ,\ \hat{y}\ ,\ \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt; are moving with time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; during the slew.

'''Ethics''' or '''moral philosophy''' is a branch of [[philosophy]] that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong [[action (philosophy)|conduct]].&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt; The field of ethics, along with [[aesthetics]], concern matters of [[Value (ethics)|value]], and thus comprise the branch of [[philosophy]] called [[axiology]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Unabridged Dictionary]]'': [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/axiology Entry on Axiology.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human [[morality]] by defining concepts such as [[good and evil]], right and [[wrong]], [[virtue]] and [[vice]], [[justice]] and [[crime]]. As a field of intellectual inquiry, moral [[philosophy]] also is related to the fields of [[moral psychology]], [[descriptive ethics]], and [[value theory]].

Three major areas of study within ethics recognized today are:&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;
# [[Meta-ethics]], concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their [[truth value]]s (if any) can be determined
# [[Normative ethics]], concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action
# [[Applied ethics]], concerning what a person is [[obligated]] (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

==Defining ethics==
The English word "ethics" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''ēthikós'' ({{lang|el|ἠθικός}}), meaning "relating to one's character", which itself comes from the root word ''êthos'' ({{lang|el|ἦθος}}) meaning "character, moral nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon|year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was borrowed into [[Latin]] as ''ethica'' and then into French as ''éthique'', from which it was borrowed into English.

[[Rushworth Kidder]] states that "standard definitions of ''ethics'' have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character' or 'the science of moral duty'{{-"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Good People Make Tough Choices: Resolving the Dilemmas of Ethical Living|last=Kidder|first= Rushworth|year=2003|publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|location=New York|ISBN=0-688-17590-2|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard William Paul and [[Linda Elder]] define ethics as "a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures".&lt;ref name="Reference A"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|last1=Paul|first1=Richard|last2=Elder |first2=Linda|year=2006|publisher=Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location=United States|ISBN=0-944583-17-2|page=NP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' states that the word "ethics" is "commonly used interchangeably with '[[morality]]'&amp;nbsp;... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual."&lt;ref&gt;John Deigh in Robert Audi (ed), ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul and Elder state that most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs and the law and don't treat ethics as a stand-alone concept.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|last1=Paul|first1=Richard|last2=Elder |first2=Linda|year=2006|publisher=Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location=United States|isbn=0-944583-17-2|page=np}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''ethics'' in English refers to several things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=October 4, 2015|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethic|title=Definition of ethic by Merriam Webster|publisher= Merriam Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can refer to [[philosophical]] ethics or moral philosophy—a project that attempts to use reason to answer various kinds of ethical questions. As the English philosopher [[Bernard Williams]] writes, attempting to explain moral philosophy: "What makes an inquiry a philosophical one is reflective generality and a style of argument that claims to be rationally persuasive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy|last=Williams|first=Bernard|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams describes the content of this area of inquiry as addressing the very broad question, "how one should live".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy|last=Williams|first=Bernard|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics can also refer to a common human ability to think about [[ethical]] problems that is not particular to philosophy. As [[bioethicist]] Larry Churchill has written: "Ethics, understood as the capacity to think critically about moral values and direct our actions in terms of such values, is a generic human capacity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are We Professionals? A Critical Look at the Social Role of Bioethicists.
|journal=Daedalus|year=1999|pages=253–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics can also be used to describe a particular person's own [[idiosyncratic]] principles or habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 24, 2014 |accessdate=July 22, 2014 |url=http://soulofwit.com/2014/01/24/Buddha-And-Socrates-Share-Common-Ground |title=Buddha and Socrates share Common ground |author=David Tanguay |publisher=Soul of Wit |archivedate=July 22, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722174808/http://soulofwit.com/2014/01/24/Buddha-And-Socrates-Share-Common-Ground |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: "Joe has strange ethics."

==Meta-ethics==
{{Main|Meta-ethics}}
Meta-ethics is the branch of philosophical ethics that asks how we understand, know about, and what we mean when we talk about what is right and what is wrong.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/intro_1.shtml |title=What is ethics? |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=July 22, 2014 |archivedate=October 28, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028131348/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/intro_1.shtml |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; An ethical question pertaining to a particular practical situation—such as, "Should I eat this particular piece of chocolate cake?"—cannot be a meta-ethical question (rather, this is an applied ethical question). A meta-ethical question is abstract and relates to a wide range of more specific practical questions. For example, "Is it ever possible to have secure knowledge of what is right and wrong?" is a meta-ethical question.

Meta-ethics has always accompanied philosophical ethics. For example, Aristotle implies that less precise knowledge is possible in ethics than in other spheres of inquiry, and he regards ethical knowledge as depending upon habit and [[acculturation]] in a way that makes it distinctive from other kinds of knowledge. Meta-ethics is also important in [[George Edward Moore|G.E. Moore]]'s ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' from 1903. In it he first wrote about what he called ''the [[naturalistic fallacy]]''. Moore was seen to reject [[Ethical naturalism|naturalism]] in ethics, in his [[Open Question Argument]]. This made thinkers look again at second order questions about ethics. Earlier, the Scottish [[philosopher]] [[David Hume]] had put forward a similar view on the difference between [[Is-ought problem|facts and values]].

Studies of how we know in ethics divide into [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]]; this is quite akin to the thing called descriptive and non-descriptive. Non-cognitivism is the view that when we judge something as morally right or wrong, this is neither true nor false. We may, for example, be only expressing our emotional feelings about these things.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/non-cogn/&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitivism can then be seen as the claim that when we talk about right and wrong, we are talking about matters of fact.

The [[ontology]] of ethics is about [[Value (ethics)|value]]-bearing things or properties, i.e. the kind of things or stuff referred to by ethical propositions. Non-descriptivists and non-cognitivists believe that ethics does not need a specific [[ontology]] since ethical propositions do not refer. This is known as an anti-realist position. Realists, on the other hand, must explain what kind of entities, properties or states are relevant for ethics, how they have value, and why they guide and motivate our actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = The Conditions of Moral Realism | url = | journal = The Journal of Philosophical Research | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 123–155 | doi=10.5840/jpr_2009_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normative ethics==
{{Main|Normative ethics}}
[[Normative ethics|Normative]] ethics is the study of ethical action. It is the branch of ethics that investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. Normative ethics is distinct from [[meta-ethics]] because normative ethics examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Normative ethics is also distinct from [[descriptive ethics]], as the latter is an [[empirical]] investigation of people's moral beliefs. To put it another way, descriptive ethics would be concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that killing is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is correct to hold such a belief. Hence, normative ethics is sometimes called prescriptive, rather than descriptive. However, on certain versions of the meta-ethical view called [[moral realism]], moral facts are both descriptive and prescriptive at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavalier |first=Robert |title=Meta-ethics, Normative Ethics, and Applied Ethics |work=Online Guide to Ethics and Moral Philosophy |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |archivedate=November 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112114345/http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, normative ethics (also known as moral theory) was the study of what makes actions right and wrong. These theories offered an overarching moral principle one could appeal to in resolving difficult moral decisions.

At the turn of the 20th century, moral theories became more complex and were no longer concerned solely with rightness and wrongness, but were interested in many different kinds of moral status. During the middle of the century, the study of normative ethics declined as meta-ethics grew in prominence. This focus on meta-ethics was in part caused by an intense linguistic focus in [[analytic philosophy]] and by the popularity of [[logical positivism]].

===Virtue ethics===
{{main|Virtue ethics}}
[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Socrates]]]]
[[Virtue ethics|Virtue]] ethics describes the character of a moral agent as a driving force for ethical behavior, and it is used to describe the ethics of [[Socrates]], [[Aristotle]], and other early Greek philosophers. [[Socrates]] (469–399 BC) was one of the first [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] to encourage both scholars and the common citizen to turn their attention from the outside world to the condition of humankind. In this view, [[knowledge]] bearing on human life was placed highest, while all other knowledge was secondary. [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]] was considered necessary for success and inherently an essential good. A self-aware person will act completely within his capabilities to his pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty. To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existence, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good if they know what is right. Evil or bad actions are the results of ignorance. If a criminal was truly aware of the intellectual and spiritual consequences of his or her actions, he or she would neither commit nor even consider committing those actions. Any person who knows what is truly right will automatically do it, according to Socrates. While he correlated knowledge with [[virtue]], he similarly equated virtue with [[joy]]. The truly wise man will know what is right, do what is good, and therefore be happy.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William S. Sahakian|author2=Mabel Lewis Sahakian|title=Ideas of the Great Philosophers|year=1966|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–33}}

[[Aristotle]] (384–323&amp;nbsp;BC) posited an ethical system that may be termed "virtuous". In Aristotle's view, when a person acts in accordance with virtue this person will do good and be content. Unhappiness and frustration are caused by doing wrong, leading to failed goals and a poor life. Therefore, it is imperative for people to act in accordance with virtue, which is only attainable by the practice of the virtues in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as civic life or [[wealth]], were only made worthwhile and of benefit when employed in the practice of the virtues. The practice of the virtues is the surest path to happiness.

Aristotle asserted that the soul of man had three natures: body (physical/metabolism), animal (emotional/appetite), and rational (mental/conceptual). Physical nature can be assuaged through exercise and care; emotional nature through indulgence of instinct and urges; and mental nature through human reason and developed potential. Rational development was considered the most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. [[Moderation]] was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, [[courage]] is the moderate virtue between the extremes of [[cowardice]] and [[recklessness (psychology)|recklessness]]. Man should not simply live, but live well with conduct governed by virtue. This is regarded as difficult, as virtue denotes doing the right thing, in the right way, at the right time, for the right reason.

====Stoicism====
{{main|Stoicism}}
[[File:Epictetus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Epictetus]]]]
The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Epictetus]] posited that the greatest good was contentment and serenity. Peace of mind, or ''[[apatheia]]'', was of the highest [[Value (ethics)|value]]; self-mastery over one's desires and emotions leads to spiritual peace. The "unconquerable will" is central to this philosophy. The individual's will should be independent and inviolate. Allowing a person to disturb the mental equilibrium is, in essence, offering yourself in slavery. If a person is free to anger you at will, you have no control over your internal world, and therefore no freedom. Freedom from material attachments is also necessary. If a thing breaks, the person should not be upset, but realize it was a thing that could break. Similarly, if someone should die, those close to them should hold to their serenity because the loved one was made of flesh and blood destined to death. Stoic philosophy says to accept things that cannot be changed, resigning oneself to the existence and enduring in a rational fashion. Death is not feared. People do not "lose" their life, but instead "return", for they are returning to God (who initially gave what the person is as a person). Epictetus said difficult problems in life should not be avoided, but rather embraced. They are spiritual exercises needed for the health of the spirit, just as physical exercise is required for the health of the body. He also stated that sex and sexual desire are to be avoided as the greatest threat to the [[integrity]] and equilibrium of a man's mind. Abstinence is highly desirable. Epictetus said remaining abstinent in the face of temptation was a victory for which a man could be proud.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|38–41}}

====Contemporary virtue ethics====
Modern virtue ethics was popularized during the late 20th century in large part as a response to [[G. E. M. Anscombe]]'s "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]". Anscombe argues that consequentialist and deontological ethics are only feasible as universal theories if the two schools ground themselves in divine law. As a deeply devoted Christian herself, Anscombe proposed that either those who do not give ethical credence to notions of divine law take up virtue ethics, which does not necessitate universal laws as agents themselves are investigated for virtue or vice and held up to "universal standards", or that those who wish to be utilitarian or consequentialist ground their theories in religious conviction.&lt;ref name="Vries"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Professor Michiel S. S. De De Vries|author2=Professor Pan Suk Kim|title=Value and Virtue in Public Administration: A Comparative Perspective|date=October 28, 2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-35709-9|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], who wrote the book ''[[After Virtue]]'', was a key contributor and proponent of modern virtue ethics, although some claim that MacIntyre supports a relativistic account of virtue based on [[Norm (social)|cultural norms]], not objective standards.&lt;ref name="Vries"/&gt; [[Martha Nussbaum]], a contemporary virtue ethicist, objects to MacIntyre's relativism, among that of others, and responds to relativist objections to form an objective account in her work "Non-Relative Virtues: An Aristotelian Approach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|title=Non-Relative Virtues: An Aristotelian Approach|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nussbaum's accusation of relativism appears to be a misreading. In ''Whose Justice, Whose Rationality?'', MacIntyre's ambition of taking a rational path beyond relativism was quite clear when he stated "rival claims made by different traditions […] are to be evaluated […] without relativism" (p.&amp;nbsp;354) because indeed "rational debate between and rational choice among rival traditions is possible” (p.&amp;nbsp;352). ''Complete Conduct Principles for the 21st Century''&lt;ref name="ethics"&gt;John Newton, Ph.D., ''Complete Conduct Principles for the 21st Century'' (2000). {{ISBN|0-9673705-7-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; blended the Eastern virtue ethics and the Western virtue ethics, with some modifications to suit the 21st Century, and formed a part of contemporary virtue ethics.&lt;ref name="ethics" /&gt;

===Hedonism===
{{Main|Hedonism}}
[[Hedonism]] posits that the principal ethic is maximizing [[pleasure]] and minimizing [[suffering|pain]]. There are several schools of Hedonist thought ranging from those advocating the indulgence of even momentary desires to those teaching a pursuit of spiritual bliss. In their consideration of consequences, they range from those advocating [[self-gratification]] regardless of the pain and expense to others, to those stating that the most ethical pursuit maximizes pleasure and happiness for the most people.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

====Cyrenaic hedonism====
Founded by [[Aristippus]] of Cyrene, [[Cyrenaics]] supported immediate gratification or pleasure. "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die." Even fleeting desires should be indulged, for fear the opportunity should be forever lost. There was little to no concern with the future, the present dominating in the pursuit of immediate pleasure. Cyrenaic hedonism encouraged the pursuit of enjoyment and indulgence without hesitation, believing pleasure to be the only good.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

====Epicureanism====
{{Main|Epicureanism}}
Epicurean ethics is a hedonist form of virtue ethics. [[Epicurus]] "...presented a sustained argument that pleasure, correctly understood, will coincide with virtue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/#9 Ancient Ethical Theory], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the extremism of the [[Cyrenaics]], believing some pleasures and indulgences to be detrimental to human beings. [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] observed that indiscriminate indulgence sometimes resulted in negative consequences. Some experiences were therefore rejected out of hand, and some unpleasant experiences endured in the present to ensure a better life in the future. To Epicurus, the ''summum bonum'', or greatest good, was prudence, exercised through moderation and caution. Excessive indulgence can be destructive to pleasure and can even lead to pain. For example, eating one food too often makes a person lose a taste for it. Eating too much food at once leads to discomfort and ill-health. Pain and fear were to be avoided. Living was essentially good, barring pain and illness. Death was not to be feared. Fear was considered the source of most unhappiness. Conquering the fear of death would naturally lead to a happier life. Epicurus reasoned if there were an afterlife and immortality, the fear of death was irrational. If there was no life after death, then the person would not be alive to suffer, fear or worry; he would be non-existent in death. It is irrational to fret over circumstances that do not exist, such as one's state of death in the absence of an afterlife.&lt;ref name="SahakianSahakian1966"/&gt;{{rp|37–38}}

===State consequentialism===
{{Main|State consequentialism}}
[[State consequentialism]], also known as Mohist consequentialism,&lt;ref name="readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Readings in classical Chinese philosophy|year=2005|last=Ivanhoe|first=P.J.|last2= Van Norden|first2= Bryan William|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-87220-780-6 |page=60|quote=he advocated a form of state consequentialism, which sought to maximize three basic goods: the wealth, order, and population of the state}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ethical theory that evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the basic goods of a state.&lt;ref name=readings/&gt; The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BC, as "a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Chris, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/ Mohism]", ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Edward N. Zalta.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike utilitarianism, which views pleasure as a moral good, "the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are&amp;nbsp;... order, material wealth, and increase in population".&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]]|year=1999|last=Loewe|first=Michael|last2=Shaughnessy|first2=Edward L.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-47030-8|page=761}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Mozi]]'s era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. The "material wealth" of Mohist consequentialism refers to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|basic needs]] like shelter and clothing, and the "order" of Mohist consequentialism refers to Mozi's stance against warfare and violence, which he viewed as pointless and a threat to social stability.&lt;ref name="Norden"&gt;{{cite book|title= Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy|year=2011|last=Van Norden|first=Bryan W. |publisher=[[Hackett Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-60384-468-0|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanford University|Stanford]] [[sinologist]] [[David S. Nivison|David Shepherd Nivison]], in ''[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]]'', writes that the moral goods of Mohism "are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth&amp;nbsp;... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically."&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt; The Mohists believed that morality is based on "promoting the benefit of all under heaven and eliminating harm to all under heaven". In contrast to Bentham's views, state consequentialism is not utilitarian because it is not hedonistic or individualistic. The importance of outcomes that are good for the community outweigh the importance of individual pleasure and pain.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jay L. Garfield|author2=William Edelglass|title=The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F06FKmKKIXwC&amp;pg=PA62|date=June 9, 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-532899-8|page=62|quote=The goods that serve as criteria of morality are collective or public, in contrast, for instance, to individual happiness or well-being}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequentialism/teleology===
{{Main|Consequentialism}}
{{See also|Ethical egoism}}
Consequentialism refers to moral theories that hold the consequences of a particular action form the basis for any valid moral judgment about that action (or create a structure for judgment, see [[#Rule consequentialism|rule consequentialism]]). Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right action is one that produces a good outcome, or consequence. This view is often expressed as the [[aphorism]] ''"The ends justify the means"''.

The term "consequentialism" was coined by [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] in her essay "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]].&lt;ref name="Anscombe"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=G.E.M. Anscombe|title= Modern Moral Philosophy|journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]|volume=33|pages=1–19 |url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/cmt/mmp.html|doi=10.1017/S0031819100037943 |year=1958|author=Anscombe, G. E. M.|publisher=1958|issue=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term has become common in English-language ethical theory.

The defining feature of consequentialist moral theories is the weight given to the consequences in evaluating the rightness and wrongness of actions.&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|authorlink=J._L._Mackie|origyear=1977|title=Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=0-14-013558-8|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consequentialist theories, the consequences of an action or rule generally outweigh other considerations. Apart from this basic outline, there is little else that can be unequivocally said about consequentialism as such. However, there are some questions that many consequentialist theories address:
* What sort of consequences count as good consequences?
* Who is the primary beneficiary of moral action?
* How are the consequences judged and who judges them?

One way to divide various consequentialisms is by the many types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to [[utilitarianism]], a good action is one that results in an increase and positive effect, and the best action is one that results in that effect for the greatest number. Closely related is [[eudaimonia|eudaimonic]] consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in [[Equality of outcome|material equality]] or [[Freedom (political)|political liberty]] instead of something like the more ephemeral "pleasure". Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally.  Whether a particular consequentialist theory focuses on a single good or many, conflicts and tensions between different good states of affairs are to be expected and must be adjudicated.

====Utilitarianism====
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Jeremy Bentham]]
[[File:John Stuart Mill by London Stereoscopic Company, c1870.jpg|thumb|upright|John Stuart Mill]]
Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that argues the proper course of action is one that maximizes a positive effect, such as "happiness", "welfare", or the ability to live according to personal preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ethics Toolkit: A Compendium of Ethical Concepts and Methods|edition=|last=Baqgini|first=Julian|author-link=Julian Baggini |last2=Fosl|first2=Peter S.|author2-link=Peter S.

In ''A Fragment on Government'' Bentham says 'it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong' and describes this as a fundamental [[axiom]]. In ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' he talks of 'the principle of utility' but later prefers "the greatest happiness principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bentham |first= Jeremy|title=The Works of Jeremy Bentham: Published under the Superintendence of His Executor, John Bowring. Volume 1|year=2001|publisher=Adamant Media Corporation|page=18|isbn= 978-1-4021-6393-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Stuart Mill"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11224/11224-h/11224-h.htm#CHAPTER_I Mill, John Stuart, Utilitarianism (Project Gutenberg online edition)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilitarianism is the paradigmatic example of a consequentialist moral theory. This form of utilitarianism holds that the morally correct action is the one that produces the best outcome for all people affected by the action. [[John Stuart Mill]], in his exposition of utilitarianism, proposed a hierarchy of pleasures, meaning that the pursuit of certain kinds of pleasure is more highly valued than the pursuit of other pleasures.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;{{cite book|title= Utilitarianism|year=1998|last=Mill|first=John Stuart|authorlink=John Stuart Mill|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn = 978-0-19-875163-2|url= http://www.utilitarianism.com/mill1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy proponents of utilitarianism are neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], author of ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', and moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]], author of, amongst other works, ''[[Practical Ethics]]''.

The major division within utilitarianism is between ''[[act utilitarianism]]'' and ''[[rule utilitarianism]]''. In act utilitarianism, the principle of utility applies directly to each alternative act in a situation of choice. The right act is the one that brings about the best results (or the least amount of bad results). In rule utilitarianism, the principle of utility determines the validity of rules of conduct (moral principles). A rule like promise-keeping is established by looking at the consequences of a world in which people break promises at will and a world in which promises are binding. Right and wrong are the following or breaking of rules that are sanctioned by their utilitarian value.&lt;ref name="Carnegie Mellon University"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/80130/part2/sect9.html |work=Department of Philosophy, [[Carnegie Mellon University]] |title=Utilitarian Theories |year=1996 |access-date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed "middle ground" between these two types is [[Two-level utilitarianism]], where rules are applied in ordinary circumstances, but with an allowance to choose actions outside of such rules when unusual situations call for it.

===Deontology===
&lt;!-- Section linked from "Categorical imperative" --&gt;
{{Main|Deontological ethics}}
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]

Deontological ethics or deontology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δέον}}, ''deon'', "obligation, duty"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is an approach to ethics that determines goodness or rightness from examining [[acts]], or the rules and duties that the person doing the act strove to fulfill.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/ Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in contrast to [[consequentialism]], in which rightness is based on the consequences of an act, and not the act by itself. Under deontology, an act may be considered right even if the act produces a bad consequence,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Robert G. 1967. 'Deontological Ethics'. In Paul Edwards (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: [[Collier Macmillan]]: 343.&lt;/ref&gt; if it follows the ''rule'' or moral law.  According to the deontological view, people have a ''duty'' to act in a way that does those things that are inherently good as acts ("truth-telling" for example), or follow an objectively obligatory rule (as in [[rule utilitarianism]]).

Immanuel Kant's theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Orend, Brian. 2000. ''War and International Justice: A Kantian Perspective''. West Waterloo, Ontario: [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]]: 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Eugene. 2006. ''The Basics of Western Philosophy''. [[Greenwood Press]]: 160.&lt;/ref&gt; First, Kant argues that to act in the morally right way, people must act from duty (''deon'').&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1780. 'Preface'. In ''The Metaphysical Elements of Ethics''. Translated by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Kant argued that it was not the consequences of actions that make them right or wrong but the motives (expressed as maxims) of the person who carries out the action. Kant's argument that to act in the morally right way, one must act from duty, begins with an argument that the highest good must be both good in itself, and good without qualification.&lt;ref name="transition"&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1785. 'First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical', [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]].&lt;/ref&gt; Something is 'good in itself' when it is [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically good]], and 'good without qualification' when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as [[intelligence]], perseverance and [[pleasure]], fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears to not be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, they make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nothing in the world—indeed nothing even beyond the world—can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a ''good will''.&lt;ref name="transition" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pragmatic ethics===
{{Main|Pragmatic ethics}}
Associated with the [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and especially [[John Dewey]], pragmatic ethics holds that moral correctness evolves similarly to scientific knowledge: socially over the course of many lifetimes. Thus, we should prioritize social reform over attempts to account for consequences, individual virtue or duty (although these may be worthwhile attempts, if social reform is provided for).&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Hugh|editor-last= Lafollette|series=Blackwell Philosophy Guides|edition=1|url=http://www.hughlafollette.com/papers/pragmati.htm |date=February 2000|title=The Blackwell Guide to Ethical Theory|isbn=978-0-631-20119-9 | publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics of care===
{{Main|Ethics of care}}
Care ethics contrasts with more well-known ethical models, such as consequentialist theories (e.g. utilitarianism) and deontological theories (e.g., Kantian ethics) in that it seeks to incorporate traditionally feminized virtues and values that—proponents of care ethics contend—are absent in such traditional models of ethics. These values include the importance of empathetic relationships and compassion.

Care-focused feminism is a branch of feminist thought, informed primarily by ethics of care as developed by [[Carol Gilligan]] and [[Nel Noddings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-ethics/#CarEthTheDifVoi|title=Feminist Ethics|last=Tong|first=Rosemarie|last2=Williams|first2=Nancy|date=May 4, 2009|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab|access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This body of theory is critical of how caring is socially assigned to women, and consequently devalued. They write, “Care-focused feminists regard women’s capacity for care as a human strength,” that should be taught to and expected of men as well as women.  Noddings proposes that ethical caring has the potential to be a more concrete evaluative model of moral dilemma than an ethic of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education, page 3-4. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  Noddings’ care-focused feminism requires practical application of [[Nel Noddings#Nel Noddings' relational ethics|relational ethics]], predicated on an ethic of care.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Women and Evil, page 222. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role ethics===
{{main|Role ethics}}
Role ethics is an ethical theory based on [[family]] roles.&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Roger T. Ames |author=Roger T. Ames|title=Confucian Role Ethics: A Vocabulary|date=April 30, 2011|publisher= University of Hawaiʻi Press|isbn=978-0-8248-3576-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[virtue ethics]], role ethics is not individualistic. Morality is derived from a person's relationship with their community.&lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Fraser|author2=Dan Robins |author3=Timothy O'Leary|title=Ethics in Early China: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2Qqf6ZXxh0C&amp;pg=PA35|date=May 1, 2011|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-988-8028-93-1|pages=17–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ethics is an example of role ethics&lt;ref name="Ames"/&gt; though this is not straightforwardly uncontested.&lt;ref&gt;Sim, May, 2015, “Why Confucius’ Ethics is a Virtue Ethics”, in Besser-Jones and Slote (2015), pp. 63–76&lt;/ref&gt; Confucian roles center around the concept of [[filial piety]] or ''xiao'', a respect for family members.&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wonsuk Chang|author2=Leah Kalmanson|title=Confucianism in Context: Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UC1mvUKaU8C&amp;pg=PA68|date=November 8, 2010|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|isbn=978-1-4384-3191-8|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roger T. Ames]] and Henry Rosemont, "Confucian normativity is defined by living one's family roles to maximum effect." Morality is determined through a person's fulfillment of a role, such as that of a parent or a child. Confucian roles are not [[rationalism|rational]], and originate through the ''xin'', or human emotions.&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt;

===Anarchist ethics===
{{Main|Anarchism}}
[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] ethics is an ethical theory based on the studies of anarchist thinkers. The biggest contributor to the anarchist ethics is the Russian zoologist, geographer, economist, and political activist [[Peter Kropotkin]].

Starting from the premise that the goal of ethical philosophy should be to help humans adapt and thrive in evolutionary terms, Kropotkin's ethical framework uses biology and anthropology as a basis – in order to scientifically establish what will best enable a given social order to thrive biologically and socially – and advocates certain behavioural practices to enhance humanity's capacity for freedom and well-being, namely practices which emphasise solidarity, equality, and justice.

Kropotkin argues that ethics itself is evolutionary, and is inherited as a sort of a social instinct through cultural history, and by so, he rejects any religious and transcendental explanation of morality. The origin of ethical feeling in both animals and humans can be found, he claims, in the natural fact of "sociality" (mutualistic symbiosis), which humans can then combine with the instinct for justice (i.e. equality) and then with the practice of reason to construct a non-supernatural and anarchistic system of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-ethics-origin-and-development.pdf "Ethics: Origin and Development" by Pëtr Kropotkin]&lt;/ref&gt; Kropotkin suggests that the principle of equality at the core of anarchism is the same as the [[Golden rule]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;This principle of treating others as one wishes to be treated oneself, what is it but the very same principle as equality, the fundamental principle of anarchism? And how can any one manage to believe himself an anarchist unless he practices it? We do not wish to be ruled. And by this very fact, do we not declare that we ourselves wish to rule nobody? We do not wish to be deceived, we wish always to be told nothing but the truth. And by this very fact, do we not declare that we ourselves do not wish to deceive anybody, that we promise to always tell the truth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth? We do not wish to have the fruits of our labor stolen from us. And by that very fact, do we not declare that we respect the fruits of others' labor? By what right indeed can we demand that we should be treated in one fashion, reserving it to ourselves to treat others in a fashion entirely different? Our sense of equality revolts at such an idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/AM/anarchist_moralityVI.html "Anarchist morality", chapter VI, Pëtr Kropotkin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Postmodern ethics===
{{Main|Postmodernism}}
{{Synthesis|date=July 2009}}
The 20th century saw a remarkable expansion and evolution of critical theory, following on earlier [[Marxism|Marxist Theory]] efforts to locate individuals within larger structural frameworks of ideology and action.

[[Antihumanism|Antihumanists]] such as [[Louis Althusser]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Structuralism|structuralists]] such as [[Roland Barthes]] challenged the possibilities of individual agency and the coherence of the notion of the 'individual' itself. This was on the basis that personal identity was, at least in part, a social construction. As critical theory developed in the later 20th century, [[post-structuralism]] sought to problematize human relationships to knowledge and 'objective' reality. [[Jacques Derrida]] argued that access to meaning and the 'real' was always deferred, and sought to demonstrate via recourse to the linguistic realm that "there is no outside-text/non-text" ("''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''" is often mistranslated as "there is nothing outside the text"); at the same time, [[Jean Baudrillard]] theorised that signs and symbols or simulacra mask reality (and eventually the absence of reality itself), particularly in the consumer world.

Post-structuralism and [[postmodernism]] argue that ethics must study the complex and relational conditions of actions.  A simple alignment of ideas of right and particular acts is not possible.  There will always be an ethical remainder that cannot be taken into account or often even recognized.  Such theorists find narrative (or, following Nietzsche and Foucault, [[genealogy]]) to be a helpful tool for understanding ethics because narrative is always about particular lived experiences in all their complexity rather than the assignment of an idea or norm to separate and individual actions.

[[Zygmunt Bauman]] says [[postmodernity]] is best described as modernity without illusion, the illusion being the belief that humanity can be repaired by some ethic principle.  Postmodernity can be seen in this light as accepting the messy nature of humanity as unchangeable.

David Couzens Hoy states that [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s writings on the face of the Other and [[Derrida]]'s meditations on the relevance of death to ethics are signs of the "ethical turn" in Continental philosophy that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. Hoy describes post-critique ethics as the "obligations that present themselves as necessarily to be fulfilled but are neither forced on one or are enforceable" (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;103).

Hoy's post-critique model uses the term ''ethical resistance''. Examples of this would be an individual's resistance to consumerism in a retreat to a simpler but perhaps harder lifestyle, or an individual's resistance to a terminal illness. Hoy describes Levinas's account as "not the attempt to use power against itself, or to mobilize sectors of the population to exert their political power; the ethical resistance is instead the resistance of the powerless"(2004, p.&amp;nbsp;8).

Hoy concludes that
{{quote|The ethical resistance of the powerless others to our capacity to exert power over them is therefore what imposes unenforceable obligations on us. The obligations are unenforceable precisely because of the other's lack of power. That actions are at once obligatory and at the same time unenforceable is what put them in the category of the ethical. Obligations that were enforced would, by the virtue of the force behind them, not be freely undertaken and would not be in the realm of the ethical. (2004, p. 184)}}

==Applied ethics==
{{Main|Applied ethics}}
Applied ethics is a discipline of philosophy that attempts to apply ethical theory to real-life situations.  The discipline has many specialized fields, such as [[engineering ethics]], [[bioethics]], [[geoethics]], public service ethics and [[business ethics]].

===Specific questions===
Applied ethics is used in some aspects of determining public policy, as well as by individuals facing difficult decisions. The sort of questions addressed by applied ethics include: "Is getting an abortion immoral?" "Is euthanasia immoral?" "Is affirmative action right or wrong?" "What are human rights, and how do we determine them?" "Do animals have rights as well?" and "Do individuals have the right of self-determination?"&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

A more specific question could be: "If someone else can make better out of his/her life than I can, is it then moral to sacrifice myself for them if needed?" Without these questions, there is no clear fulcrum on which to balance law, politics, and the practice of arbitration—in fact, no common assumptions of all participants—so the ability to formulate the questions are prior to rights balancing. But not all questions studied in applied ethics concern public policy. For example, making ethical judgments regarding questions such as, "Is lying always wrong?" and, "If not, when is it permissible?" is prior to any etiquette.

People, in general, are more comfortable with dichotomies (two opposites).  However, in ethics, the issues are most often multifaceted and the best-proposed actions address many different areas concurrently. In ethical decisions, the answer is almost never a "yes or no", "right or wrong" statement. Many buttons are pushed so that the overall condition is improved and not to the benefit of any particular faction.

===Particular fields of application===
====Bioethics====
{{Main|Bioethics}}
{{See also|Islamic bioethics|Jewish medical ethics}}
Bioethics is the study of controversial ethics brought about by advances in [[biology]] and [[medicine]]. Bioethicists are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among [[life sciences]], [[biotechnology]], [[medicine]], [[politics]], [[law]], and [[philosophy]]. It also includes the study of the more commonplace questions of values ([[primary care ethics|"the ethics of the ordinary"]]) that arise in primary care and other branches of medicine.

Bioethics also needs to address emerging biotechnologies that affect basic biology and future humans. These developments include [[cloning]], [[gene therapy]], [[human genetic engineering]], astroethics and life in space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astroethics.com/ |title=Astroethics |accessdate=December 21, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060209/http://www.astroethics.com/ |archivedate=October 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and manipulation of basic biology through altered DNA, RNA and proteins, e.g. "three parent baby, where baby is born from genetically modified embryos, would have DNA from a mother, a father and from a female donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freemont|first1=P.

I.|year=2012|title=Synthetic Biology|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|location =New Jersey|isbn=978-1-84816-862-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, new bioethics also need to address life at its core. For example, [[biotic ethics]] value organic gene/protein life itself and seek to propagate it.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mautner|first=Michael N.|title=Life-centered ethics, and the human future in space|journal=[[Bioethics (journal)|Bioethics]]|volume=23|issue=8|pages=433–440|year=2009|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00688.x|pmid=19077128|url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; With such life-centered principles, ethics may secure a cosmological future for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mautner|first=Michael N.|title= Seeding the Universe with Life: Securing Our Cosmological Future|publisher=[[Legacy Books]] (www.amazon.com)|location=Washington D.

====Business ethics====
{{Main|Business ethics}}
Business ethics (also corporate ethics) is a form of [[applied ethics]] or [[professional ethics]] that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that arise in a business environment, including fields like [[medical ethics]]. Business ethics represents the practices that any individual or group exhibits within an organization that can negatively or positively affect the businesses core values. It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations.

Business ethics has both [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and descriptive dimensions. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflect the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns. Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, today most major corporations promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters. Adam Smith said, "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A (1776/1952). ''An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations''. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions. Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control.&lt;ref&gt;Berle, A. A., &amp; Means, G. C. (1932). The Modern Corporation and Private Property. New Jersey: Transaction Publishers. In this book, Berle and Means observe, "Corporations have ceased to be merely legal devices through which the private business transactions of individuals may be carried on. Though still much used for this purpose, the corporate form has acquired a much larger significance. The corporation has, in fact, become both a method of property tenure and a means of organizing economic life. Grown to tremendous proportions, there may be said to have evolved a 'corporate system'—as there once was a feudal system—which has attracted to itself a combination of attributes and powers, and has attained a degree of prominence entitling it to be dealt with as a major social institution.&amp;nbsp;... We are examining this institution probably before it has attained its zenith. Spectacular as its rise has been, every indication seems to be that the system will move forward to proportions which stagger imagination today&amp;nbsp;... They [management] have placed the community in a position to demand that the modern corporation serve not only the owners&amp;nbsp;... but all society." p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of large corporations with limited relationships and sensitivity to the communities in which they operate accelerated the development of formal ethics regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=C. |first2=M. |last2=Parker |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CSKX2HdnikC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=For Business Ethics: A Critical Text |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-31135-7 |display-authors=etal |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=ferrell|first=o.c|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9781305500846|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Machine ethics====
{{Main|Machine ethics}}
In ''Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong'', Wendell Wallach and Colin Allen conclude that issues in [[machine ethics]] will likely drive advancement in understanding of human ethics by forcing us to address gaps in modern normative theory and by providing a platform for experimental investigation.&lt;ref name=Wallach2008&gt;{{cite book|first1=Wendell |last1=Wallach|first2=Colin|last2=Allen|date=November 2008|title=Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong|isbn=978-0-19-537404-9|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=USA|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort to actually program a machine or artificial agent to behave as though instilled with a sense of ethics requires new specificity in our normative theories, especially regarding aspects customarily considered common-sense. For example, machines, unlike humans, can support a wide selection of [[List of machine learning algorithms|learning algorithms]], and controversy has arisen over the relative ethical merits of these options. This may reopen classic debates of normative ethics framed in new (highly technical) terms.

====Military ethics====
{{See also|Geneva Conventions|Nuremberg Principles}}

Military ethics are concerned with questions regarding the application of force and the ethos of the soldier and are often understood as applied professional ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last2=Syse|first2=Henrik|last1=Cook|first1=Martin L.|title=What Should We Mean by 'Military Ethics'?|journal=Journal of Military Ethics|volume=9|issue=2|year=2010|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Just war theory]] is generally seen to set the background terms of military ethics. However individual countries and traditions have different fields of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Emmanuel|last=Goffi|authorlink=Emmanuel Goffi|year=2011|title=Les Armée Françaises Face à la Morale|trans-title=The French Army Facing Morale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpyjGdEsCA4C|language=fr|location=France|publisher=L'Harmattan|isbn=978-2296542495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military ethics involves multiple subareas, including the following among others:
# what, if any, should be the laws of war.
# justification for the initiation of military force.
# decisions about who may be targeted in warfare.
# decisions on choice of weaponry, and what collateral effects such weaponry may have.
# standards for handling military prisoners.
# methods of dealing with violations of the laws of war.

====Political ethics====
{{main|Political ethics}}
Political ethics (also known as political morality or public ethics) is the practice of making moral judgements about political action and political agents.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis F. "Political Ethics". ''International Encyclopedia of Ethics'', ed. Hugh LaFollette (Blackwell Publishing, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public sector ethics====
{{main|Public sector ethics}}
Public sector ethics is a set of principles that guide public officials in their service to their constituents, including their decision-making on behalf of their constituents.  Fundamental to the concept of public sector ethics is the notion that decisions and actions are based on what best serves the public's interests, as opposed to the official's personal interests (including financial interests) or self-serving political interests.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, work of Institute for Local Government, at [http://www.ca-ilg.org/trust www.ca-ilg.org/trust].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Publication ethics====
Publication ethics is the set of principles that guide the writing and publishing process for all professional publications. To follow these principles, authors must verify that the publication does not contain [[plagiarism]] or [[publication bias]].&lt;ref name="Publication ethics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Neil|title=Publication ethics|journal=Pediatric Anesthesia|date=October 2009|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1011–1013|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03086.x/full|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03086.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a way to avoid misconduct in research these principles can also apply to experiments that are referenced or analyzed in publications by ensuring the data is recorded honestly and accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wager|first1=E|last2=Fiack|first2=S|last3=Graf|first3=C|last4=Robinson|first4=A|last5=Rowlands|first5=I|title=Science journal editors' views on publication ethics: results of an international survey|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=31 March 2009|volume=35|issue=6|pages=348–353|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/35/6/348.short|doi=10.1136/jme.2008.028324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagiarism is the failure to give credit to another author’s work or ideas, when it is used in the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scollon|first1=Ron|title=Plagiarism|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|date=June 1999|volume=9|pages=188–190|jstor=43102462|doi=10.1525/jlin.1999.9.1-2.188|issue=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the obligation of the editor of the journal to ensure the article does not contain any plagiarism before it is published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wager|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Williams|first2=Peter|title=Why and how do journals retract articles? An analysis of Medline retractions 1988—2008|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=September 2011|volume=37|issue=9|pages=567–570|jstor=23034717|doi=10.1136/jme.2010.040964}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a publication that has already been published is proven to contain plagiarism, the editor of the journal can retract the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanjeev|first1=Handa|title=Plagiarism and publication ethics: Dos and don'ts|journal=Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology|date=2008|volume=74|issue=4|pages=301–303|url=http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2008;volume=74;issue=4;spage=301;epage=303;aulast=Handa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication bias occurs when the publication is one-sided or "[[prejudiced]] against results".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigelman|first1=Lee|title=Publication Bias Reconsidered|journal=Political Analysis|date=2000|volume=8|issue=2|pages=201–210|jstor=25791607|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pan.a029813}}&lt;/ref&gt; In best practice, an author should try to include information from all parties involved, or affected by the topic. If an author is prejudiced against certain results, than it can "lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peters|first1=Jamie L.|last2=Sutton|first2=Alex J.|last3=Jones|first3=David R.|last4=Abrams|first4=Keith R.|last5=Rushton|first5=Lesley|last6=Moreno|first6=Santiago G.|title=Assessing publication bias in meta-analysis in the presence of between-study heterogeneity|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A (Statistics in Society)|date=July 2010|volume=173|issue=3|pages=575–591|doi=10.1111/j.1467-985x.2009.00629.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Misconduct in research can occur when an experimenter falsifies results.&lt;ref name="j25175246"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Richard|title=Misconduct in Research: Editors Respond: The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) Is Formed|journal=British Medical Journal|date=July 26, 1997|volume=315|issue=7102|pages=201–202|jstor=25175246|doi=10.1136/bmj.315.7102.201|pmc=2127155|pmid=9253258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falsely recorded information occurs when the researcher "fakes" information or data, which was not used when conducting the actual experiment.&lt;ref name="j25175246"/&gt; By faking the data, the researcher can alter the results from the experiment to better fit the hypothesis they originally predicted. When conducting medical research, it is important to honor the healthcare rights of a patient by protecting their [[anonymity]] in the publication.&lt;ref name="Publication ethics"/&gt;
''Respect for autonomy'' is the principle that decision-making should allow individuals to be autonomous; they should be able to make decisions that apply to their own lives. This means that individuals should have control of their lives.
''Justice'' is the principle that decision-makers must focus on actions that are fair to those affected. Ethical decisions need to be consistent with the ethical theory. There are cases where the management has made decisions that seem to be unfair to the employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders (Solomon, 1992, pp49). Such decisions are unethical.

====Relational ethics====
Relational ethics are related to an [[ethics of care]].&lt;ref name="GILLIGAN2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Gilligan|title=In a Different Voice|date=June 30, 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03761-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62–63}} They are used in qualitative research, especially ethnography and autoethnography. Researchers who employ relational ethics value and respect the connection between themselves and the people they study, and "...between researchers and the communities in which they live and work." (Ellis, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = C | year = 2007 | title = Telling secrets, revealing lives: Relational ethics in research with intimate others | url = | journal = Qualitative Inquiry | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 3–29 | doi=10.1177/1077800406294947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relational ethics also help researchers understand difficult issues such as conducting research on intimate others that have died and developing friendships with their participants.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1986). ''Fisher folk. Two communities on Chesapeake Bay.'' Lexington: [[University Press of Kentucky]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1995).''Final negotiations: A story of love, loss, and chronic illness.'' Philadelphia: [[Temple University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Relational ethics in close personal relationships form a central concept of [[Ivan Böszörményi-Nagy#Contextual therapy|contextual therapy]].

====Animal ethics====
{{Main|Animal ethics}}
Animal ethics is a term used in academia to describe human-animal relationships and how animals ought to be treated. The subject matter includes [[animal rights]], [[animal welfare]], [[animal law]], [[speciesism]], [[animal cognition]], [[wildlife conservation]], the moral status of nonhuman animals, the concept of nonhuman [[personhood]], [[Anthropocentrism|human exceptionalism]], the history of animal use, and theories of [[justice]].

==Moral psychology==
{{Main|Moral psychology}}
'''Moral psychology''' is a field of study that began as an issue in [[philosophy]] and that is now properly considered part of the discipline of [[psychology]].  Some use the term "moral psychology" relatively narrowly to refer to the study of [[moral development]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Lapsley (2006) and "moral psychology" (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, others tend to use the term more broadly to include any topics at the intersection of ethics and psychology (and [[philosophy of mind]]).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Doris &amp; Stich (2008) and Wallace (2007). Wallace writes: "Moral psychology is the study of morality in its psychological dimensions" (p. 86).&lt;/ref&gt; Such topics are ones that involve the mind and are relevant to moral issues. Some of the main topics of the field are [[moral responsibility]], moral development, [[moral character]] (especially as related to [[virtue ethics]]), [[altruism]], [[psychological egoism]], [[moral luck]], and moral disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;See Doris &amp; Stich (2008), §1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary ethics===
{{Main|Evolutionary ethics}}
{{See also|Evolution of morality}}
Evolutionary ethics concerns approaches to ethics (morality) based on the role of evolution in shaping human psychology and behavior. Such approaches may be based in scientific fields such as [[evolutionary psychology]] or [[sociobiology]], with a focus on understanding and explaining observed ethical preferences and choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evol-eth/ |title=Evolutionary Ethics |author=Doris Schroeder |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007081051/http://www.iep.utm.edu/evol-eth/ |archivedate=October 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptive ethics==
{{Main|Descriptive ethics}}
Descriptive ethics is on the less philosophical end of the spectrum since it seeks to gather particular information about how people live and draw general conclusions based on observed patterns. Abstract and theoretical questions that are more clearly philosophical—such as, "Is ethical knowledge possible?"—are not central to descriptive ethics. Descriptive ethics offers a [[Value-neutral|value-free]] approach to ethics, which defines it as a social science rather than [[humanities|a humanity]].  Its examination of ethics doesn't start with a preconceived theory but rather investigates [[revealed preference|observations of actual choices]] made by moral agents in practice. Some philosophers rely on descriptive ethics and choices made and unchallenged by a [[society]] or [[culture]] to derive categories, which typically vary by context. This can lead to [[situational ethics]] and [[situated ethics]]. These philosophers often view [[aesthetics]], [[etiquette]], and [[arbitration]] as more fundamental, percolating "bottom up" to imply the existence of, rather than explicitly prescribe, theories of value or of conduct. The study of descriptive ethics may include examinations of the following:
* [[Ethical code]]s applied by various groups. Some consider aesthetics itself the basis of ethics—and a personal [[moral core]] developed through art and storytelling as very influential in one's later ethical choices.
* Informal theories of etiquette that tend to be less rigorous and more situational. Some consider etiquette a simple negative ethics, i.e., where can one evade an uncomfortable truth without doing wrong? One notable advocate of this view is [[Judith Martin]] ("Miss Manners"). According to this view, ethics is more a summary of [[common sense]] social decisions.
* Practices in arbitration and [[law]], e.g., the claim that ethics itself is a matter of balancing "right versus right", i.e., putting priorities on two things that are both right, but that must be traded off carefully in each situation.
* [[Revealed preference|Observed choices]] made by ordinary people, without expert aid or advice, who [[Voting|vote]], buy, and decide what is worth valuing. This is a major concern of sociology, [[political science]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hary Gunarto]], Ethical Issues in Cyberspace and IT Society, Symposium on Whither The Age of Uncertainty, APU Univ., [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254440840_Ethical_Issues_in_Cyberspace_and_IT_Society paper],  Jan. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fatalism''' is a [[philosophical]] doctrine that stresses the subjugation of all events or actions to [[destiny]]. 

Fatalism generally refers to any of the following ideas:
* The view that we are powerless to do anything other than what we actually do.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fatalism/|title=Fatalism|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]|author=Hugh Rice|date=October 11, 2010|accessdate=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in this is that humans have no power to influence the future, or indeed, their own actions.&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt; This belief is very similar to [[predeterminism]].
* An attitude of resignation in the face of some future event or events which are thought to be inevitable. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] named this idea "Turkish fatalism"&lt;ref&gt;[http://metheus.eu/kutuphane/turk-kaderciligi Metheus]&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''[[The Wanderer and His Shadow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, The Wanderer and His Shadow, 1880, Türkenfatalismus&lt;/ref&gt;
* That acceptance is appropriate, rather than resistance against inevitability. This belief is very similar to [[defeatism]].
* Some take it to mean [[determinism]].

== Antiquity ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2016}}
[[Ājīvika]] (also written Ajivika or Ajivaka, literally meaning "living" in Sanskrit) was a system of ancient [[Indian philosophy]] and an ascetic movement of the [[Mahajanapada]] period in the Indian subcontinent. Ājīvika followers believed that a cycle of reincarnation of the soul was determined by a precise and non-personal cosmic principle called ''niyati'' (destiny or fate) that was completely independent of the person's actions. The same sources therefore make them out to be strict fatalists, who did not believe in [[karma]].
"If all future occurrences are rigidly determined ..., coming events may in some sense be said to exist already. The future exists in the present, and both exist in the past. Time is thus on ultimate analysis illusory". "Every phase of a process is always present. ... in a soul which has attained salvation its earthly births are still present. Nothing is destroyed and nothing is produced. ... Not only are all things determined, but their change and development is a cosmic illusion."{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} [[Makkhali Gosala]] (Pāli; BHS: Maskarin Gośāla; Jain Prakrit sources: Gosala Mankhaliputta) was an [[ascetic]] teacher of ancient India. He is regarded to have been born in 484 BCE and was a contemporary of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of [[Buddhism]], and of [[Mahavira]], the last and 24th Tirthankara of [[Jainism]].

==Determinism and predeterminism==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2016}}
While the terms are often used interchangeably, fatalism, [[determinism]], and [[predeterminism]] are discrete in stressing different aspects of the futility of human will or the foreordination of destiny. However, all these doctrines share common ground.

''Determinists'' generally agree that human actions affect the future but that human action is itself determined by a causal chain of prior events. Their view does not accentuate a "submission" to fate or destiny, whereas ''fatalists'' stress an acceptance of future events as inevitable. Determinists believe the future is fixed specifically due to [[causality]]; fatalists and predeterminists believe that some or all aspects of the future are inescapable, but, for fatalists, not necessarily due to causality.

Fatalism is a looser term than determinism. The presence of historical "indeterminisms" or chances, i.e. events that could not be predicted by sole knowledge of other events, is an idea still compatible with fatalism. Necessity (such as a law of nature) will happen just as inevitably as a chance—both can be imagined as sovereign.

Likewise, determinism is a broader term than predeterminism. ''Predeterminists'', as a specific type of determinists, believe that every single event or effect is caused by an uninterrupted chain of events that goes back to the origin of the universe. Determinists, holding a more generic view, meanwhile, believe that each event is at least caused by recent prior events, if not also by such far-extending and unbroken events as those going back in time to the universe's very origins.

Fatalism, by referring to the personal "fate" or to "predestined events" strongly imply the existence of a ''someone'' or ''something'' that has set the "predestination." This is usually interpreted to mean a conscious, [[omniscient]] being or force who has personally planned—and therefore knows at all times—the exact succession of every event in the past, present, and future, none of which can be altered.

==Idle Argument==
One famous ancient argument regarding fatalism was the so-called [[Lazy argument|''Idle Argument'']]. It argues that if something is fated, then it would be pointless or futile to make any effort to bring it about. The Idle Argument was described by [[Origen]] and [[Cicero]] and it went like this:

*If it is [[destiny|fate]]d for you to recover from this illness, then you will recover whether you call a doctor or not.
*Likewise, if you are fated not to recover, you will not do so whether you call a doctor or not.
*But either it is fated that you will recover from this illness, or it is fated that you will not recover.
*Therefore, it is futile to consult a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Origen ''Contra Celsum'' II 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Fato'' 28-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Idle Argument was anticipated by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[De Interpretatione]]'' chapter 9. The [[Stoics]] considered it to be a [[sophism]] and the Stoic [[Chrysippus]] attempted to refute it by pointing out that consulting the doctor would be as much fated as recovering. He seems to have introduced the idea that in cases like that at issue two events can be ''co-fated'', so that one cannot occur without the other.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien]], ''Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, a false argument because it fails to consider that those fated to recover may be those fated to consult a doctor.

==Logical fatalism and the argument from bivalence==
Another famous argument for fatalism that goes back to antiquity is one that depends not on causation or physical circumstances but rather is based on presumed [[logical truth]]s. There are numerous versions of this argument, including those by [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ball0888/salamis/interpretatione.html Aristotle, De Interpretatione, 9]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Richard Taylor]].&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fatalism|author=Richard Taylor|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=71|number=1|date=January 1962|pages=56–66|publisher=Duke University Press|jstor=2183681}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have been objected to and elaborated on&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt; but do not enjoy mainstream support.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The key idea of logical fatalism is that there is a body of true propositions (statements) about what is going to happen, and these are true regardless of when they are made. So, for example, if it is true today that tomorrow there will be a sea battle, then there cannot fail to be a sea battle tomorrow, since otherwise it would not be true today that such a battle will take place tomorrow.

The argument relies heavily on the [[principle of bivalence]]: the idea that any proposition is either true or false.  As a result of this principle, if it is not false that there will be a sea battle, then it is true; there is no in-between.  However, rejecting the principle of bivalence—perhaps by saying that the truth of a proposition regarding the future is indeterminate—is a controversial view since the principle is an accepted part of [[classical logic]].

==Criticism==
===Semantic equivocation===
The basic logical structure of logical fatalism is criticized as false. The structure of its argument is "Either a certain event happens or it doesn't happen. If it happens, there is nothing to be done to prevent it. If it doesn't happen, there is nothing to be done to enable it." The problem in the argument arises with the semantics of "if". The argument fails because it uses "if" to imply that the event will happen with absolute certainty, when there is only certainty that the event ''either'' happens ''or'' doesn't, when both options are considered. Neither option by itself is certain, even though both options together are certain. The use of the word "if" in this way frames the sentence as "if the event is certain to happen, then there is nothing to be done to prevent it", but there is no certainty that the event will happen. Thus this type of fatalism relies on [[circular reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|publisher=Clarendon Press Oxford|year=1996|pages=352-358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism comes from the novelist [[David Foster Wallace]], who in a 1985 paper "[[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Richard Taylor]]'s ''Fatalism'' and the Semantics of Physical Modality" suggests that Taylor reached his conclusion of fatalism only because his argument involved two different and inconsistent notions of impossibility.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Consider the Philosopher|first=James|last=Ryerson|date=December 12, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/magazine/14wwln-Wallace-t.html|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace did not reject fatalism ''per se'', as he wrote in his closing passage, "if Taylor and the fatalists want to force upon us a metaphysical conclusion, they must do metaphysics, not semantics. And this seems entirely appropriate."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Willem deVries and Jay Garfield, both of whom were advisers on Wallace’s thesis, expressed regret that Wallace never published his argument.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; In 2010, the thesis was, however, published posthumously as ''Time, Fate, and Language: An Essay on Free Will''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8407">In [[mathematics]], specifically in the [[calculus of variations]], a variation {{math|''&amp;delta;f''}} of a function {{math|''f''}} can be concentrated on an arbitrarily small interval, but not a single point.
Accordingly, the necessary condition of extremum ([[functional derivative]] equal zero) appears in a [[weak formulation]] (variational form) integrated with an arbitrary function {{math|''&amp;delta;f''}}. The '''fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations''' is typically used to transform this weak formulation into the strong formulation ([[differential equation]]), free of the integration with arbitrary function. The proof usually exploits the possibility to choose {{math|''&amp;delta;f''}} concentrated on an interval on which {{math|''f''}} keeps sign (positive or negative). Several versions of the lemma are in use. Basic versions are easy to formulate and prove. More powerful versions are used when needed.

==Basic version==

:If a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on an open interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b f(x)h(x)\,\operatorname{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all [[compactly supported]] [[smooth function]]s &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is identically zero.&lt;ref name=J1&gt;{{harvnb|Jost|Li-Jost|1998|loc=Lemma 1.1.1 on p.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GF1&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=Lemma 1 on p.9 (and Remark)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here "smooth" may be interpreted as "infinitely differentiable",&lt;ref name=J1 /&gt; but often is interpreted as "twice continuously differentiable" or "continuously differentiable" or even just "continuous",&lt;ref name=GF1 /&gt; since these weaker statements may be strong enough for a given task. "Compactly supported" means "vanishes outside &lt;math&gt;(c,d)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;c&lt;d&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;";&lt;ref name=J1 /&gt; but often a weaker statement suffices, assuming only that &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and a number of its derivatives) vanishes at the endpoints &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;ref name=GF1 /&gt; in this case the closed interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is used.

==Version for two given functions==

:If a pair of continuous functions ''f'', ''g'' on an interval (''a'',''b'') satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b ( f(x) \, h(x) + g(x) \, h'(x) ) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on (''a'',''b''), then ''g'' is differentiable, and ''g''' = ''f'' &amp;nbsp;everywhere.&lt;ref name=GF4&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=Lemma 4 on p.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H1&gt;{{harvnb|Hestenes|1966|loc=Lemma 15.1 on p.50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special case for ''g'' = 0 is just the basic version.

Here is the special case for ''f'' = 0 (often sufficient).

:If a continuous function ''g'' on an interval (''a'',''b'') satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b g(x) \, h'(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on (''a'',''b''), then ''g'' is [[Constant function|constant]].&lt;ref name=GF2&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=Lemma 2 on p.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If, in addition, [[continuously differentiable|continuous differentiability]] of ''g'' is assumed, then [[integration by parts]] reduces both statements to the basic version; this case is attributed to [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], while the proof of differentiability of ''g'' is due to [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]].

==Versions for discontinuous functions==

The given functions (''f'', ''g'') may be discontinuous, provided that they are [[locally integrable]] (on the given interval). In this case, [[Lebesgue integration]] is meant, the conclusions hold [[almost everywhere]] (thus, in all continuity points), and differentiability of ''g'' is interpreted as local [[absolute continuity]] (rather than continuous differentiability).&lt;ref name=J2&gt;{{harvnb|Jost|Li-Jost|1998|loc=Lemma 1.2.1 on p.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gia&gt;{{harvnb|Giaquinta|Hildebrandt|1996|loc=section 2.3: Mollifiers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the given functions are assumed to be [[piecewise continuous]], in which case [[Riemann integration]] suffices, and the conclusions are stated everywhere except the finite set of discontinuity points.&lt;ref name=H1 /&gt;

==Higher derivatives==

:If a tuple of continuous functions &lt;math&gt;f_0,f_1,\dots,f_n&lt;/math&gt; on an interval (''a'',''b'') satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b ( f_0(x) \, h(x) + f_1(x) \, h'(x) + \dots + f_n(x) \, h^{(n)}(x) ) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on (''a'',''b''), then there exist continuously differentiable functions &lt;math&gt; u_0,u_1,\dots,u_{n-1} &lt;/math&gt; on (''a'',''b'') such that
::&lt;math&gt; f_0 = u'_0, \; f_1 = u_0+u'_1, \; \dots, \; f_{n-1}=u_{n-2}+u'_{n-1}, \; f_n = u_{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;
:everywhere.&lt;ref name=H2&gt;{{harvnb|Hestenes|1966|loc=Lemma 13.1 on p.105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This necessary condition is also sufficient, since the integrand becomes &lt;math&gt; (u_0 h)' + (u_1 h')' + \dots + (u_{n-1} h^{(n-1)})'. &lt;/math&gt;

The case ''n'' = 1 is just the version for two given functions, since &lt;math&gt; f=f_0=u'_0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f_1=u_0, &lt;/math&gt; thus, &lt;math&gt; f_0-f'_1 = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

In contrast, the case ''n''=2 does not lead to the relation &lt;math&gt; f_0 - f'_1 + f''_2 = 0, &lt;/math&gt; since the function &lt;math&gt; f_2 = u_1 &lt;/math&gt; need not be differentiable twice. The sufficient condition &lt;math&gt; f_0 - f'_1 + f''_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; is not necessary. Rather, the necessary and sufficient condition may be written as &lt;math&gt; f_0 - (f_1 - f'_2)' = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for ''n''=2, &lt;math&gt; f_0 - (f_1 - (f_2-f'_3)')' = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for ''n''=3, and so on; in general, the brackets cannot be opened because of non-differentiability.

==Vector-valued functions==

Generalization to [[vector-valued functions]] &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\to\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; is straightforward; one applies the results for scalar functions to each coordinate separately,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=p.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; or treats the vector-valued case from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jost|Li-Jost|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multivariable functions==

:If a continuous [[Function of several real variables|multivariable function]] ''f'' on an open set &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_\Omega f(x) \, h(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on Ω, then ''f'' is identically zero.

Similarly to the basic version, one may consider a continuous function ''f'' on the closure of Ω, assuming that ''h'' vanishes on the boundary of Ω (rather than compactly supported).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=Lemma on p.22}}; the proof applies in both situations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is a version for discontinuous multivariable functions.

:Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; be an open set, and &lt;math&gt;f\in L^2(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_\Omega f(x) \, h(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on Ω. Then ''f''=0 (in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, almost everywhere).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jost|Li-Jost|1998|loc=Lemma 3.2.3 on p.170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
This lemma is used to prove that [[maxima and minima|extrema]] of the [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]
:&lt;math&gt; J[y] = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} L(t,y(t),\dot y(t)) \, \mathrm{d}t &lt;/math&gt;
are  [[weak solution]]s &lt;math&gt;y:[x_0,x_1]\to V&lt;/math&gt; (for an appropriate vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;) of the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; {\partial L(t,y(t),\dot y(t)) \over \partial y} = {\mathrm{d} \over \mathrm{d}t} {\partial L(t,y(t),\dot y(t)) \over \partial \dot y} .&lt;/math&gt;
The Euler–Lagrange equation plays a prominent role in [[classical mechanics]] and [[differential geometry]].

The '''Garden of Eden''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] גַּן עֵדֶן, ''Gan ʿEḏen''), also called '''Paradise''', is the biblical "garden of God" described in the [[Book of Genesis]] and the [[Book of Ezekiel]]..&lt;ref name="Metzger2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Metzger|first1= Bruce Manning|last2= Coogan|first2= Michael D|title= The Oxford Guide To People And Places Of The Bible|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=amlXOOaSuLMC|accessdate= 22 December 2012|year= 2004|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 978-0-19-517610-0|page= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 2011 228–229"&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2011|pp= 228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genesis 13:10 refers to the "garden of God",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Genesis+13|title=oremus Bible Browser : Genesis 13|website=bible.oremus.org|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "trees of the garden" are mentioned in Ezekiel 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Ezekiel+31|title=oremus Bible Browser : Ezekiel 31|website=bible.oremus.org|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Ezekiel+31|title=oremus Bible Browser : Ezekiel 31|website=bible.oremus.org|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Zechariah]] and the [[Book of Psalms]] also refer to trees and water without explicitly mentioning Eden.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tigchelaar|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name derives from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''edinnu'', from a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] word ''[[Edin (Sumerian term)|edin]]'' meaning "plain" or "steppe", closely related to an [[Aramaic]] root word meaning "fruitful, well-watered".&lt;ref name="Cohen 2011 228–229"/&gt; Another interpretation associates the name with a Hebrew word for "pleasure"; thus the [[Douay-Rheims Bible]] in Genesis 2:8 has the wording
"And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure" rather than "a garden in Eden". The Hebrew term is translated "pleasure" in Sarah's secret saying in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|18:9-15|HE|Genesis 18:12|HE}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/strongs/H5731 H5731 Eden]  – The same as H5730 (masculine); Eden= "pleasure" ... the first habitat of man after the creation; site unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[Genesis flood narrative]], the [[Genesis creation narrative]] and the account of the [[Tower of Babel]], the story of Eden echoes the [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian myth]] of a king, as a primordial man, who is placed in a divine garden to guard the [[Tree of Life]].{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p= 33}} The [[Hebrew Bible]] depicts [[Adam and Eve]] as walking around the Garden of Eden naked due to their innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Miller (2007) ''Miller 3-in-1: Blue Like Jazz, Through Painted Deserts, Searching for God'', Thomas Nelson Inc, {{ISBN|978-1418551179}}, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tfHksenSLIEC&amp;pg=PT207#v=onepage&amp;q=naked%20%22garden%20of%20eden%22%20nudity&amp;f=false PT207]&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of Eden is described in the Book of Genesis as the source of four tributaries. The Garden of Eden is considered to be [[Mythology|mythological]] by most scholars.&lt;ref name=loc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc2/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc5/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc4/&gt; Among those that consider it to have been real, there have been various suggestions for its location:&lt;ref name="wilensky2012"/&gt; at the head of the [[Persian Gulf]], in southern Mesopotamia (now Iraq) where the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers run into the sea;&lt;ref name=loc7/&gt; and in [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name=loc8/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc10/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc11/&gt;

===Genesis===
{{main article|Genesis creation narrative|Adam and Eve}}

The second part of the [[Genesis creation narrative]]&lt;!--do not remove the word narrative, click the link and read why it is called this--&gt;, {{bibleverse|Genesis|2:4-3:24|HE}}, opens with [[YHWH]]-[[Elohim]] (translated here "the {{LORD}} God", see [[Names of God in Judaism]]) creating the first man ([[Adam]]), whom he placed in a garden that he planted "eastward in Eden".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levenson|2004|p=13}} "The root of Eden denotes fertility. Where the wondrously fertile gard was thought to have been located (if a realistic location was ever conceived) is unclear. The Tigris and Euphrates are the two great rivers of the Mesopotamia (now found in modern Iraq). But the Piston is unidentified, and the only Gihon in the Bible is a spring in Jerusalem (1 Kings 1.33, 38)."&lt;/ref&gt; "And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Genesis|2:9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The man was free to eat from any tree in the garden except the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. Last of all, the God made a woman ([[Eve]]) from a rib of the man to be a companion for the man. In chapter three, the man and the woman were seduced by the [[Serpents in the Bible|serpent]] into eating the [[forbidden fruit]], and they were expelled from the garden to prevent them from eating of the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]], and thus living forever. [[Cherub]]im were placed east of the garden, "and a [[Flaming sword (mythology)|flaming sword]] which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life" ({{bibleverse|Genesis|3:24}}).

{{bibleverse|Genesis|2:10–14|HE}} lists four rivers in association with the garden of Eden: [[Pishon]], [[Gihon]], Chidekel (the [[Tigris]]), and Phirat (the [[Euphrates]]). It also refers to the land of [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]]—translated/interpreted as [[Ethiopia]], but thought by some to equate to ''Cossaea'', a Greek name for the land of the [[Kassites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=me8sAAAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Cossaea  |title=The Jewish Quarterly Review|journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |publication-date=1973 |volume=64-65 |page=132 |issn=1553-0604 |accessdate=2014-02-19 |quote=...as Cossaea, the country of the Kassites in Mesopotamia [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lands lie north of [[Elam]], immediately to the east of ancient Babylon, which, unlike Ethiopia, does lie within the region being described.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Speiser|1994|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', the first-century Jewish historian [[Josephus]] identifies the Pishon as what "the Greeks called [[Ganges]]" and the Geon (Gehon) as the [[Nile]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews''. Book I, Chapter 1, Section 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lars-Ivar Ringbom the ''paradisus terrestris'' is located in [[Shiz]] in northeastern [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Lars-Ivar Ringbom, ''Paradisus Terrestris. Myt, Bild Och Verklighet'', Helsingfors, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ezekiel===
{{main article|Ezekiel's cherub in Eden}}

In {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|28:12–19|HE}} the prophet [[Ezekiel]] the "son of man"&lt;!-- v.12 --&gt; sets down God's word against the king of Tyre: the king was the "seal of perfection",&lt;!-- v.12 --&gt; adorned with precious stones from the day of his creation,&lt;!-- v.13 --&gt; placed by God in the garden of Eden on the holy mountain as a guardian cherub.&lt;!-- v.14 --&gt; But the king sinned through wickedness and violence, and so he was driven out of the garden and thrown to the earth, where now he is consumed by God's fire: "All those who knew you in the nations are appalled at you, you have come to a horrible end and will be no more." (v.19).

According to Terje Stordalen, the Eden in Ezekiel appears to be located in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stordalen|2000|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[I]t appears that the Lebanon is an alternative placement in Phoenician myth (as in Ez 28,13, III.48) of the Garden of Eden",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2001|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are connections between paradise, the garden of Eden and the forests of Lebanon (possibly used symbolically) within prophetic writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swarup|2006|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Lipinski (orientalist)|Edward Lipinski]] and [[Peter Kyle McCarter]] have suggested that the [[Garden of the gods (Sumerian paradise)]], the oldest [[Sumer]]ian version of the Garden of Eden, relates to a mountain sanctuary in the Lebanon and [[Anti-Lebanon mountains|Anti-Lebanon ranges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2009|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed locations==

The location of Eden is described in the Book of Genesis, chapter 2, verses 10–14:

{{quote|And a river departed from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four tributaries.
The name of the first is Pishon, which is the circumnavigator of the land of Havilah where there is gold.
And the gold of this land is good; there are [[bdellium]] and cornelian stone.
And the name of the second river is Gihon, which is the circumnavigator of the land of Cush.
And the name of the third is Chidekel, which is that which goes to the east of Ashur; and the fourth river is Phirat.|sign=|source=}}

==Parallel concepts==
* [[Dilmun]] in the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] story of ''Enki and Ninhursag'' is a paradisaical abode{{sfn|Mathews|1996|pp=96}} of the immortals, where sickness and death were unknown.{{sfn|Cohen|2011|pp=229}}
* The [[Hesperides|garden of the Hesperides]] in [[Greek mythology]] was somewhat similar to the Christian concept of the Garden of Eden, and by the 16th century a larger intellectual association was made in the [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]] painting (''see illustration at top''). In this painting, only the ''action'' that takes place there identifies the setting as distinct from the Garden of the Hesperides, with its golden fruit.
* The Persian term "[[paradise]]" (borrowed as {{lang-he|פרדס}}, ''pardes''), meaning a royal garden or hunting-park, gradually became a synonym for Eden after c. 500&amp;nbsp;BCE. The word "''pardes''" occurs three times in the Hebrew Bible, but always in contexts other than a connection with Eden: in the [[Song of Solomon]] iv. 13: "Thy plants are an orchard (''pardes'') of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard"; [[Ecclesiastes]] 2. 5: "I made me gardens and orchards (''pardes''), and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits"; and in [[Nehemiah]] ii. 8: "And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's orchard (''pardes''), that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city." In these examples ''pardes'' clearly means "orchard" or "park", but in the [[apocalyptic literature]] and in the [[Talmud]] "paradise" gains its associations with the Garden of Eden and its heavenly prototype, and in the [[New Testament]] "paradise" becomes the realm of the blessed (as opposed to the realm of the cursed) among those who have already died, with literary [[Hellenistic]] influences.

==Other views==
===Jewish eschatology===
In the [[Talmud]] and the Jewish [[Kabbalah]],&lt;ref name="Gan Eden"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=39&amp;letter=E Gan Eden] – JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called "Garden in Eden". The first is rather terrestrial, of abundant fertility and luxuriant vegetation, known as the "lower Gan Eden". The second is envisioned as being celestial, the habitation of righteous, Jewish and non-Jewish, immortal souls, known as the "higher Gan Eden". The [[Rabbi|Rabbanim]] differentiate between ''Gan'' and Eden. Adam is said to have dwelt only in the ''Gan'', whereas Eden is said never to be witnessed by any mortal eye.&lt;ref name="Gan Eden"/&gt;

According to [[Jewish eschatology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba – The Afterlife] - JewFAQ.org; 02-22-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eshatology"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=460&amp;letter=E#1239 Eshatology] – JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the higher Gan Eden is called the "Garden of Righteousness". It has been created since the beginning of the world, and will appear gloriously at the end of time. The righteous dwelling there will enjoy the sight of the heavenly ''[[chayot]]'' carrying the throne of God. Each of the righteous will walk with God, who will lead them in a dance. Its Jewish and non-Jewish inhabitants are "clothed with garments of light and eternal life, and eat of the tree of life" (Enoch 58,3) near to God and His anointed ones.&lt;ref name="Eshatology"/&gt; This Jewish rabbinical concept of a higher Gan Eden is opposed by the Hebrew terms ''[[gehinnom]]''&lt;ref&gt;"Gehinnom is the Hebrew name; Gehenna is Yiddish." [http://www.jewfaq.org/cgi-bin/search.cgi?Keywords=Gehinnom Gehinnom – Judaism 101] websourced 02-10-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[sheol]]'', figurative names for the place of spiritual purification for the wicked dead in Judaism, a place envisioned as being at the greatest possible distance from [[heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm#Gan |title=Gan Eden and Gehinnom |publisher=Jewfaq.org |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Jewish eschatology it is believed that history will complete itself and the ultimate destination will be when all mankind returns to the Garden of Eden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=End of Days|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/a/48925077.html|work=End of Days|publisher=Aish|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic view===
[[File:Spanish-Arabic map of 1109.jpg|thumb|[[Mozarabic art|Mozarabic]] world map from 1109 with Eden in the East (at top)]]
The term ''jannāt ʿadni'' ("Gardens of Eden" or "Gardens of Perpetual Residence") is used in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] for the destination of the righteous. There are several mentions of "the Garden" in the Qur'an (2:35, 7:19, 20:117), while the Garden of Eden, without the word ''ʿadn'',&lt;ref&gt;See [http://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=lem%3AEadon+pos%3Apn list of occurrences].&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly the fourth layer of the Islamic [[Jannah|heaven]] and not necessarily thought as the dwelling place of [[Adam in Islam|Adam]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} page 133&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran refers frequently over various [[Surah]] about the first abode of Adam and Hawwa (Eve), including surat [[Sad (surah)|Sad]], which features 18 verses on the subject (38:71–88), surat [[al-Baqara]], surat [[al-A'raf]], and surat [[al-Hijr (surah)|al-Hijr]] although sometimes without mentioning the location. The narrative mainly surrounds the resulting expulsion of Hawwa and Adam after they were tempted by [[Shaitan]]. Despite the Biblical account, the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, the tree of immortality, which [[God in Islam|God]] specifically claimed it was forbidden to Adam and Eve. Some [[tafsir|exegesis]] added an account, about [[Satan]], disguised as a serpent to enter the Garden, repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, resulting in disobeying God.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, Oliver ''The Quran, an encyclopedia'', p. 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These stories are also featured in the [[hadith]] collections, including [[al-Tabari]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Brannon ''Mecca and Eden: ritual, relics, and territory in Islam'' p. 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter Day Saints===
{{see also|Adam and Eve (LDS Church)}}

Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (also known as [[Mormons]] or Latter-day Saints) believe that after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden they resided in a place known as [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]], located in present-day [[Daviess County, Missouri]]. It is recorded in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] that Adam blessed his posterity there and that he will return to that place at the time of the [[Last Judgement|final judgement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.53?lang=eng#53|title=Doctrine and Covenants 107:53|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/116.1?lang=eng#1|title=Doctrine and Covenants 116:1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fulfillment of biblical prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/7.13.13-14,22?lang=eng#12|title=Daniel 7:13-14,22|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous early leaders of the Church, including [[Brigham Young]], [[Heber C. Kimball]], and [[George Q. Cannon]], taught that the Garden of Eden itself was located in nearby [[Jackson County, Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith/Garden_of_Eden_in_Missouri "Joseph Smith/Garden of Eden in Missouri"], FairMormon Answers&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no surviving first-hand accounts of that doctrine being taught by Joseph Smith himself. LDS doctrine is unclear as to the exact location of the Garden of Eden, but tradition among Latter-Day Saints places it somewhere in the vicinity of Adam-ondi-Ahman, or in Jackson County.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce A. Van Orden, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1994/01/i-have-a-question "I Have a Question: What do we know about the location of the Garden of Eden?"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', January 1994, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/mormonism-101#C18|title=What is Mormonism?

==Art==
The Garden of Eden motifs most frequently portrayed in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and paintings are the "Sleep of Adam" ("Creation of Eve"), the "Temptation of Eve" by the Serpent, the "[[Fall of Man]]" where Adam takes the fruit, and the "Expulsion". The idyll of "Naming Day in Eden" was less often depicted. Much of [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' occurs in the Garden of Eden. [[Michelangelo]] depicted a [[:File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 022.jpg|scene]] at the Garden of Eden in the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]. In ''[[Divine Comedy|the Divine Comedy]]'', [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] places the Garden at the top of [[Purgatory|Mt. Purgatory]]. For many medieval writers, the image of the Garden of Eden also creates a location for human [[love]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], often associated with the classic and medieval [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of the [[locus amoenus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtius|1953|p=200, n.31}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of oldest depictions of Garden of Eden is made in [[Byzantine style]] in [[Ravenna]], while the city was still under Byzantine control. A preserved blue mosaic is part of the mausoleum of Galla Placidia. Circular motifs represent flowers of the garden of Eden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4714">'''Human-rating certification''', also known as '''man-rating''', is the certification of a [[spacecraft]] or [[launch vehicle]] as capable of safely transporting humans. (Since the 1990s, NASA and the U.S. [[GAO]] prefer to use "human-rating" instead of "man-rating" when describing requirements for these systems.)

According to [[NASA]], human-rating requires not just that a system is designed to be tolerant of failure and to protect the crew even if unrecoverable failure occurs, but also that astronauts aboard a human-rated spacecraft must have some control over it.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPR&amp;c=8705&amp;s=2C |title=Human Rating Requirements for Space Systems |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of technical requirements and the associated certification process for crewed space systems is required in addition to the standards and requirements that are mandatory for all of NASA's space flight programs.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt;

==NASA Commercial Crew Program==
In November 2011, [[Ed Mango (NASA)|Ed Mango]], the agency head of the NASA [[Commercial Crew Program]] (CCP), gave an extended interview on the new NASA requirements for human rating of spacecraft that will fly to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).&lt;ref name=a&amp;ss20111116&gt;

For ascent it’s 1 in 500, and independently for entry it’s 1 in 500. ... The probability for the mission itself is 1 in 270. That is an overall number. That’s loss of crew for the entire mission profile, including ascent, on-orbit, and entry. The thing that drives the 1 in 270 is really micrometeorites and orbital debris ... whatever things that are in space that you can collide with. So that’s what drops that number down, because you’ve got to look at the 210 days, the fact that your heat shield or something might be exposed to whatever that debris is for that period of time. NASA looks at Loss of Vehicle the same as Loss of Crew.  If the vehicle is damaged and it may not be detected prior to de-orbit, then you have loss of crew.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NASA CCP human-rating standards require that the [[probability]] of a loss on ascent is no more than 1 in 500, and that the probability of a loss on descent is no more than 1 in 500.  The overall mission loss risk, which includes vehicle risk from [[micrometeorite]]s and [[space debris|orbital debris]] while in orbit for up to 210 days, is required to be no more than 1 in 270.&lt;ref name=a&amp;ss20111116/&gt;  Maximum sustained [[g-force|G-loads]] are limited to three [[Gravity of Earth|Earth-standard g's]].&lt;ref name=a&amp;ss20111116/&gt;

The development of the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]] pre-dates the NASA Human-Rating requirements. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Columbia]] accidents, the criteria used by NASA for human-rating spacecraft have been made more stringent.&lt;ref name=ulaCrew/&gt;

{{About|biological waste products of the human body|other kinds of waste produced by humans|waste}}

{{Refimprove|date=February 2013}}
'''Human waste''' (or '''human excreta''') refers to the waste products of the [[human digestive system]] and the human [[metabolism]], namely [[feces]] and [[urine]]. As part of a [[sanitation]] system that is in place, human waste is collected, transported, treated and disposed of or reused by one method or another, depending on the type of [[toilets|toilet]] being used, ability by the users to pay for services and other factors. 

The sanitation systems in place differ vastly across the world, with many people in [[Developing country|developing countries]] having to resort to [[open defecation]] where human waste is deposited in the environment, for lack of other options. People in [[Developed country|developed countries]] tend to use [[Flush toilet|flush toilets]] where the human waste is mixed with water and  transported to [[sewage treatment plants]]. 

Children's excreta can be disposed of in [[diaper]]s and mixed with [[municipal solid waste]]. Diapers are also sometimes dumped directly into the environment, leading to [[public health]] risks.

==Terminology==
The term "human waste" is used in the general media to mean several things, such as [[sewage]], [[sewage sludge]], [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] - in fact anything that may contain some [[human feces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Waste May Be Flush With Gold, Silver, And Other Valuable Metals|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/25/poop-gold-human-waste-metals_n_6936262.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=8 June 2015|date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the stricter sense of the term, human waste is in fact human excreta, i.e. [[urine]] and [[human feces|feces]], with or without water being mixed in. For example, [[dry toilet|dry toilets]] collect human waste without the addition of water.

==Health aspects==
Human waste is considered a [[Biomedical waste|biowaste]], as it is a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for both [[Virus disease|viral]] and [[Pathogenic bacteria|bacterial]] diseases.  It can be a serious health hazard if it gets into sources of drinking water.  The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that nearly 2.2 million people die annually from diseases caused by contaminated water.  A major accomplishment of human civilization has been the reduction of [[Transmission_(medicine)|disease transmission]] via human waste through the practice of [[hygiene]] and [[sanitation]], which can employ a variety of different technologies.

== Environmental aspects ==
Even high-mountains are not free from human waste. Each year, millions of mountaineers visit high-mountain areas. They generate tonnes of feces and urine annually which cause environmental pollution. The authorities of mountain regions, especially in the [[Global South]] countries do not pay enough attention to the problem of excreta from mountaineers. Human feces pose a greater threat to the mountain environment than uncontrolled deposit of urine, due to the higher pathogen content of feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Apollo|first=Michal|date=2017-01-02|title=The good, the bad and the ugly – three approaches to management of human waste in a high-mountain environment|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2016.1227225|journal=International Journal of Environmental Studies|volume=74|issue=1|pages=129–158|doi=10.1080/00207233.2016.1227225|issn=0020-7233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of processing==

Methods of processing depend on the type of human waste: 
* Sewage is treated via [[sewage treatment]] 
* Sewage sludge is treated by [[sewage sludge treatment]] 
* Fecal matter from [[dry toilet|dry toilets]] may undergo [[composting]]
* Fecal sludge from pit latrines is treated and managed with an approach called [[fecal sludge management]]
The amount of water mixed with human waste can be reduced by the use of waterless [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]]s and [[composting toilet]]s and by recycling [[greywater]]. The most common method of human waste treatment in rural areas where municipal sewage systems are unavailable is the use of [[septic tank]] systems. In remote rural places without sewage or septic systems, small populations allow for the continued use of [[Bucket toilet|honey bucket]]s and sewage lagoons (see [[anaerobic lagoon]]) without the threat of disease presented by places with denser populations. [[Bucket toilet|Bucket toilets]] are used by rural villages in [[Alaska]] where, due to [[permafrost]], conventional waste treatment systems cannot be utilized.

==Uses==
{{Main|Reuse of excreta}}
Human waste in the form of wastewater (sewage) is used to irrigate and fertilize fields in many parts of the developing world where fresh water is unavailable. There is great potential for wastewater agriculture to produce more food for consumers in urban areas, as long as there is sufficient education about the dangers of eating such food uncooked.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/08/080821-human-waste.html Human Waste Used by 200 Million Farmers, Study Says]'', National Geographic News, August 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Family law}}

The term '''international child abduction''' is generally synonymous with international ''parental [[kidnapping]],'' ''child snatching'', and ''child stealing.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/resources/resources_545.html |title=THE EPIDEMIC OF PARENTAL CHILD-SNATCHING: AN OVERVIEW |publisher=US Department of State |author=HON. WILLIAM RIGLER and HOWARD L. WIEDER |year=2000|accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the more precise legal usage of ''international child abduction'' originates in [[private international law]] and refers to the illegal removal of children from their home by an acquaintance or family member to a foreign country. In this context, "illegal" is normally taken to mean "in breach of [[child custody|custodial rights]]" and "home" is defined as the child's [[habitual residence]]. As implied by the "breach of custodial rights," the phenomenon of international child abduction generally involves an illegal removal that creates a jurisdictional [[conflict of laws]] whereby multiple authorities and [[jurisdiction]]s could conceivably arrive at seemingly reasonable and conflicting custodial decisions with geographically limited application. Such a result often strongly affects a child's access and connection to half their family and may cause the loss of their former language, culture, name and nationality, it violates numerous [[children's rights]], and can cause severe psychological and emotional trauma to the child and family left behind.&lt;ref name="2010 Compliance Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/pdf/2010ComplianceReport.pdf |title=2010 Compliance Report |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date=|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a common misconception that because the abductor in these cases is usually not a stranger the children are not in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/ag/mcch/files/kid_is_with_a_parent.pdf  |title="The kid is with a parent, how bad can it be?" The Crisis of Family Abductions|publisher=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children|author=Ernie Allen |date=|accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harmful consequences for children and families have been shown in several studies  and child abduction has been characterized as a form of [[parental alienation]] and [[child abuse]].&lt;ref name="child abuse"&gt;[http://www.prevent-abuse-now.com/unreport.htm Parental Child Abduction is Child Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926135211/http://www.prevent-abuse-now.com/unreport.htm |date=2012-09-26 }}. Nancy Faulkner, Ph.D. Presented to the United Nations Convention on Child Rights in Special Session, June 9, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Adding international dimensions to the detrimental effects of child abduction significantly increases the detrimental effects on children and families.  The modern day ease of international travel and corollary increase in international marriages is leading to a rapid rise in the number of international child abductions.&lt;ref name="2010 Compliance Report" /&gt;

International child abduction occurs when one parent unlawfully takes (or retains) a [[Minor (law)|minor]] child in a country other than the one the child has his/her habitual residence. If that country is a party to the [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] (applicable to children under 16), then the child will usually be returned to the country of origin. 

== Origin of the term ==
What is today called "parental kidnapping," "international child abduction,", "parental child abduction" and "parental child trafficking" has existed as long as different legal jurisdictions and international borders have—though often under different names.  None of these names achieved the modern day broad acceptance of terms like international child abduction.  Lacking a common set of terminology or specifically designed laws to address the, at the time, poorly defined problem, researchers on the history of cross-border child abduction must search for terms like "custodial interference," "contempt of child custody orders," "legal kidnapping"  or, in cases where children were viewed more as property than as individual subjects of rights, name variations on theft, child-maintenance debt and smuggling, among others.&lt;ref name="pkpapers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepkpapers.com/

Lawmakers struggled to typify and discuss '''international child abduction''' and discussions at the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]] noted that, what some were referring to with variations on "legal kidnapping," was an oxymoron since that which is legal cannot be kidnapping and that which is kidnapping cannot be legal. The response to these concerns was the coining of the term "international child abduction."  The terms first prominent use was in the title of the 1980 [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]]. The term is not, however, used anywhere in the actual text of the convention itself in preference of the more technical terms "wrongful removal" or "wrongful retention" which were better suited for describing the mechanics of the Convention's system.&lt;ref name="HACText"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=24|title=Hague Abduction Convention text |publisher=Hcch.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term is now widespread in international law.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"&gt;{{cite web

==Internationalization of family law==
In all family law disputes a determination must be made as to which legal systems and laws should be applied to the dispute. This question becomes much more complicated when aspects, or parties, of the case occur in, or hail from, multiple legal jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

Today's international family law norms were heavily influenced by the concepts of [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] and [[nationality]]. In Europe these ideas were refined during the nineteenth century by Italian politician, [[Pasquale Mancini]], who believed matters of personal status were to be governed by the nationality of the person. During the same period in the US and Latin America the prevailing principle was that jurisdiction over personal matters was determined by domicile which, in the Americas, was acquired immediately upon moving to a foreign jurisdiction even if neither citizenship nor nationality were acquired.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

Starting in the late eighteenth century until the early 1920s a number of efforts were made to develop a series of international treaties governing international conflicts of law in Europe. Treaties that favored nationality as the determining jurisdictional factor either never got of the ground, were not widely signed or had substantial practical problems with countries renouncing them after signing. At the same time the inter-American system in Latin America produced the [[Bustamante Code]] of 1928 and the [[Montevideo Convention]]s of 1939 and 1940. Of particular note in these later Conventions was the introduction of a definition of "domicile" that started with a reference to the "habitual residence" for civil status. Lessons learned in prior efforts to create successful multilateral treaties culminated in a number of successful treaties in the mid-1900s, such as the 1961 Convention on the Protection of Minors, the New York Convention of 1956 on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance drafted under the auspices of the [[United Nations]], and the [[Hague Convention of 1961 concerning the powers of authorities and the law applicable in respect of the protection of minors]] ("1961 Convention.") &lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

The 1961 Convention brought an innovation in terminology by creating a compromise between advocates of "nationality" as the determining factor for jurisdiction and advocates for the modern fact-centric model of "habitual residence."  It also included expanded language to encompass both judicial and administrative authorities in response to the [[Boll case]], in which Sweden claimed its [[public law|public administrative law]] was exempt from the [[Hague Convention of 1902 relating to the settlement of guardianship of minors|1902 Convention on the Guardianship of minors]] because it only governed domestic private judicial law and not public administrative law. The 1961 Convention also emphasized the concept of the "interests of the child" as a basis for authorities of the child's nationality to overrule the authorities of the child's habitual residence. Of particularly special note, the drafters of the 1961 Convention expressly considered a provision addressing the removal of a child from their habitual residence with an intent to evade rightful jurisdiction—primarily for child custody reasons. This first attempt to codify international child abduction failed due to an inability to agree on a definition or manner of describing the phenomenon, with a number of countries that adhered to the principle of nationality regulating personal child and family law unable to classify their nationals removing children from foreign countries to their home state as fraudulent evasion.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

In actual cases of international child abduction, this lack of a specific provision on child abduction in the 1961 treaty resulted in countries regularly interpreting the "habitual residence" concept of the Convention in a manner that allowed parents to take children to a foreign country and immediately acquire "habitual residence."  This allowed judicial [[forum shopping]] and created [[perverse incentive]]s for removing children from their homes to foreign jurisdictions in order to game the family law system and obtain a more favorable custodial outcome than could be gained in the jurisdiction of the child's home.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

In the 1970s, dissatisfaction with these results led to efforts to create conventions on the foreign recognition and enforcement of judgments to make it harder for courts to favor a parent solely because that parent is a national suing in his or her home state. Canada also proposed that the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law|Hague Conference]] work on a Convention to address what it termed "legal kidnapping." The Hague received Canada's request enthusiastically and, inspired by a Swiss proposal originally submitted at the Council of Europe in 1976 coined a new term in international family law – "international child abduction."&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;  Although the problem of international child abduction was well understood, finding a way to address the problem in practice was exceedingly difficult, but the Swiss proposal had a solution that was elegant in its simplicity. Why not simply restore the ''status quo ante''?&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

In 1980 the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law|Hague Conference]] drafted a convention to address the problem of international child abduction: the [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] – commonly referred to as the [[Abduction Convention]]. The Swiss idea of restoring the ''status quo ante'' after a "wrongful removal" or "wrongful retention" became a mainstay of the Abduction Convention. Under the convention, an application could be made for the return of a child who had been wrongfully removed or retained so long as the applicant possessed rights of custody, and provided that those rights were being "actually exercised" at the time of the abduction. The concept of "actually exercised" in reference to custodial rights itself was an innovation in terminology. Having met these requirements a child was to be returned "forthwith" except in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name="HACText"/&gt;

Inspired by the [[Hague Evidence Convention]] and the [[Hague Service Convention]]'s of 1965 and 1970, the Abduction Convention required the establishment of a single [[Central Authority]] in each country that would handle two-way communications with domestic courts, administrative agencies and foreign central authorities. Furthermore, each central authority was required to take "any and all actions" to secure the goals of the treaty and cooperate with other central authorities to do the same. All of these new obligations emphasized the need for international cooperation amongst state parties in achieving the objectives of the convention.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

=== The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ===
{{Main|Convention on the Rights of the Child}}

Established in 1989 the '''Convention on the Rights of the Child''' reflected the growing international consensus that children be viewed as a subject of rights and not merely as an object of rights or of protective action. The [[UNCRC]] roused an unprecedented response with 187 countries ratifying it within seven years forming an essential backdrop in international children's law. Article 11 of the Convention explicitly requires State Parties to combat the illicit transfer and retention of children and promote the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral agreements or accession to existing agreements that do so, Article 35 stipulates that "States Parties shall take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction, sale or traffic of children for any purpose or in any form."&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

=== The Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation ===
{{Main|Hague Convention 1996}}

The 1996 '''Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures''' is the third of the modern [[Hague Convention 1996|Hague Conventions]] on international family law, following in the footsteps of the [[Hague Abduction Convention|Abduction Convention]] and the [[Hague Adoption Convention|Adoption Convention]]. It is much broader in scope than the first two conventions and covers a wide range of civil measures related to the protection of children including: orders concerning parental responsibility and contact, public measures of protection or care, matters of legal representation and the protection of children's property.

The Convention has uniform rules determining which country's authorities are competent to take the necessary measures of protection. The Convention also determines which country's laws are to be applied and provides for the recognition and enforcement of measures taken in one Contracting State in all the other Contracting States. The co-operation provisions of the Convention provide the basic framework for the exchange of information and the necessary degree of collaboration between administrative authorities in the Contracting States. Reflecting an ever-increasing emphasis on the need for international cooperation as an essential element in the success of these measures the Convention has a full chapter on cooperation consisting of eleven articles.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

Although initially slow to gain support and plagued with political problems, the number of states acceding to it has begun to grow.

== Impact on society, families and children ==
[[File:Report on the Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (2007 edition - front cover).jpg|thumb|175px|alt=2007 Report Cover|Cover of a US report on International Child Abduction (2007)]]

As the result of the harmful effects on children, parental kidnapping has been characterized as a form of child abuse and an extreme form of [[parental alienation]].  Abducted children suffer emotionally and sometimes physically at the hands of their abducting parents. Many are told the other parent is dead or has abandoned them. Uprooted from their entire life, home, family and friends, abducted children are often even given new names by their abductors and instructed to hide their real names or where they used to live.  Generally the abductor avoids mentioning the victim parent and waits for time to erase difficult questions, such as "When can we see mom/dad again?". These children become hostages.  It is beyond their comprehension that a parent who truly cares and loves them cannot discover their whereabouts.  Childhood cannot be recaptured.  Abductions rob a child of their sense of history, intimacy, values and morals, self-awareness, opportunity of knowing one's beginnings and the love and contact of extended family—a loss virtually no child possesses the ability to protect themselves against.

Huntington (1982) lists some of the deleterious effects of abduction on child victims:

1.  	Depression;&lt;br/&gt;
2.  	Loss of community;&lt;br/&gt;
3.  	Loss of stability, security, and trust;&lt;br/&gt;
4.  	Excessive fearfulness, even of ordinary occurrences;&lt;br/&gt;
5.  	Loneliness;&lt;br/&gt;
6.  	Anger;&lt;br/&gt;
7.  	Helplessness;&lt;br/&gt;
8.  	Disruption in identity formation; and&lt;br/&gt;
9.  	Fear of abandonment.

Many of these effects can be subsumed by the problems relevant to [[reactive attachment disorder]], stress, fear of abandonment, [[learned helplessness]], and guilt.

The extended support systems of abducting and victim parents can also become part of the dispute.  Believing primarily one side of the abduction story, family, friends, and professionals in each parents individual country may lose their objectivity. As a result, protective concerns expressed by the abandoned parent may be viewed as undue criticism, interference, and histrionics preventing the victim parent from effectively relieving the trauma imposed on their innocent child by the abduction.&lt;ref name="child abuse"/&gt;

== Mediation in child abduction cases ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}

Mediation is a process during which abductors and the left behind family, assisted by mediator(s), attempt to resolve conflicts independent of the judicial system. Mediators create a constructive atmosphere for discussions and ensure fair dealings between parents. The mediators do not make decisions; instead, they confine themselves to assisting the parties in working out for themselves a fair and sensible solution to their problems. More specifically, the mediation can address not only the child’s primary residence, but also the child’s contact with both parents, visitation arrangements, agreements concerning the child’s maintenance, schooling, further education, bi-cultural and bi-lingual upbringing, necessary arrangements for financial support etc.

Mediation can be helpful in international child abduction cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reunite.org/edit/files/Library%20-%20reunite%20Publications/Mediation%20research%20report.pdf] Reunite research 2012
&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of mediation families can deal with the question of return and also find solutions to other issues relating to their children.

== Legal justifications for abduction ==

International law has generally recognized that there may be extenuating circumstances where a child abduction may have been necessary or justifiable due to extenuating circumstances. The [[Hague Convention of 1902 relating to the settlement of guardianship of minors|1902 Convention on the Guardianship of minors]] limited such considerations to strictly emergency situations. Starting with the [[1924 Declaration on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child|1959 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child]] there was a growing recognition at the international level of the shift in nation's domestic laws away from parental authority and towards an emphasis on protecting the child, even from their own parents.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;  This foreshadowed the 1989 [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and led to the establishment of exceptional circumstances in Article 13 of the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] where the removal of children would not be considered child abduction and allow the child to remain in their new country.&lt;ref name="HACText"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perez-Vera Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcch.e-vision.nl/upload/expl28.pdf |title=Explanatory Report |publisher=Hcch.net |author=Elisa Perez-Vera|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abduction Convention: "Grave risks of harm" and "intolerable situations" ===
The principal purpose of the Abduction Convention is to cause the prompt return of a child to his or her "habitual residence."  In certain exceptional cases under Article 13b, the court's mandatory return obligation is changed to a discretionary obligation, specifically, "the judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that there is a ''grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.''"  It is important to note that the duty to return a child is not abrogated by a finding under Art. 13(b) but merely changes from mandatory to discretionary. Since the general intent of the Convention is to cause the return of a child to his or her "habitual residence," unless there are some powerful and compelling reasons otherwise the court is normally and routinely expected to exercise its discretion and return the child to his or her "habitual residence".

In the primary source of interpretation for the Convention, the Explanatory Report, Professor E. Perez-Vera noted the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"it would seem necessary to underline the fact that the three types of exception to the rule concerning the return of the child must be applied only so far as they go and no further. This implies above all that they are to be interpreted in a restrictive fashion if the Convention is not to become a dead letter. In fact, the Convention as a whole rests upon the unanimous rejection of this phenomenon of illegal child removals and upon the conviction that the best way to combat them at an international level is to refuse to grant them legal recognition. The practical application of this principle requires that the signatory States be convinced that they belong, despite their differences, to the same legal community within which the authorities of each State acknowledge that the authorities of one of them – those of the child's habitual residence – are in principle best placed to decide upon questions of custody and access. As a result, a systematic invocation of the said exceptions, substituting the forum chosen by the abductor for that of the child's residence, would lead to the collapse of the whole structure of the Convention by depriving it of the spirit of mutual confidence which is its inspiration."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In spite of the spirit and intent of the Convention as conveyed by the Convention itself and further reinforced by the Perez-Vera report, Article 13b is frequently used by abductors as a vehicle to litigate the child's [[best interests]] or [[child custody|custody]]. Although Article 13(b) inquiries are not intended to deal with issues or factual questions appropriate for custody proceedings, many countries use article 13b to request psychological profiles, detailed evaluations of parental fitness, evidence concerning lifestyle and the nature and quality of relationships.&lt;ref name="Grave risk and Art. 13b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hiltonhouse.com/articles/Art_13(b)_limit.txt |title=The Limitations on Art. 13(b) of The Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction done at the Hague on 25 Oct 1980 |author=William M. Hilton |year=1997|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These misinterpretations of the Abduction Convention's exceptions have rendered the Convention largely ineffective in accomplishing its objectives. The ''best interests'' of a child, which is explicitly never mentioned in the Convention, is an essentially subjective standard that judges often use to facilitate foreign nations' manipulation of the treaty and create a pretext for discretionary decisions. This discretion often takes the form of gender, cultural and national biases. The result is substantive non-compliance with the Abduction Convention.&lt;ref name="Who's Best Interest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/1001334-1.html |title=Whose best interest?

=== Domestic violence ===
[[File:Grandville Cent Proverbes page69.png|thumb|150px|alt=Domestic Violence|Domestic Violence]]
{{see also|Domestic violence}}
At the time the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] was drafted domestic violence was never explicitly considered as an [[affirmative defense]] for child abduction, although it may be brought as a defense under Article 13, if "there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation." Article 13 supposed that the child's primary caretaker would abduct the child to escape the domestic violence of a non-custodial parent. At the time of the Conventions drafting, [[joint custody]] laws were rare. One parent was usually both the custodial parent and primary caretaker while the other, non-custodial parent had rights of access. The move towards joint custody laws conferred both the parent who acted as the primary caretaker and their ex-partner with custodial rights and, by extension, a right to request the return of children wrongfully removed from their place of habitual residence. In addition to not accounting for a shift in child custody law towards shared parenting and joint custody, according to Weiner, the framers of the Convention also did little to account for the motivation for abducting a child, generally assuming that all abductions were harmful to children; however, the child's primary caretaker may be fleeing with a child to protect himself or herself from a dangerous domestic situation.&lt;ref name="DV and ICA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lclac.org/FordhamLawReview.htm |title=International Child Abduction and the Escape from Domestic Violence|publisher=Fordham Law Review |year=2000 |author=Merle H.

==Global Missing Children’s Network==
Launched in 1998 as a [[joint venture]] of the [[International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] (ICMEC) and the US [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]], the Global Missing Children’s Network (GMCN) is a network of countries that connect, share [[best practices]], and disseminate information and images of missing children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations.&lt;ref name=ncmissing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/GMCN|title=Global Missing Children's Network|publisher=NCMEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cyber&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0rVfRwcIPYgC&amp;pg=SA11-PA31&amp;dq=icmec+children#v=onepage&amp;q=icmec%20children&amp;f=false|title=Computer Forensics: Investigating Network Intrusions and Cyber Crime|author= EC-Council|publisher= Cengage Learning|pages=11–26, 11–31 to 11–33|year= 2009|isbn=1435483529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=more/&gt;  The Network has 22 member countries: Albania, Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the US.&lt;ref name=more&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/activities-in-more-than-22-countries-around-the-globe-will-remember-missing-children-on-may-25-2013-05-22|title=Activities in More than 22 Countries around the Globe will Remember Missing Children on May 25|date=May 22, 2013|work=MarketWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Ho received a Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1967 from [[Hong Kong University]], was postdoctoral fellow in biochemical genetics, [[University of California, San Diego]], from 1968 to 1972, senior research fellow in [[Queen Elizabeth College]], lecturer in genetics (from 1976) and [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in biology (from 1985) in the [[Open University]], and since retiring in June 2000 visiting professor of biophysics in Catania University, Sicily.&lt;ref name="Independent Science Panel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. Mae-Wan Ho bio"/&gt;

Ho died of cancer in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samburcher.com/articles/public-health/109-tribute-to-dr-mae-wan-ho-1941-2016.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wessex.ac.uk/news/general-news/910-obituary-mae-wan-ho&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institute of Science in Society ==
Ho was a co-founder and director of the Institute of Science in Society (ISIS), an [[Advocacy group|interest group]] that campaigns against what it sees as unethical uses of [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-sis.org.uk/about.php ISIS Report 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; The group published about climate change, GMOs, [[homeopathy]], traditional Chinese medicine, and [[water memory]].

In reviewing the organisation, [[David Colquhoun]] accused the ISIS of promoting [[pseudoscience]] and specifically criticised Ho's understanding of [[homeopathy]].&lt;ref name="Colquhoun"/&gt;

The institute is on the [[Quackwatch]] list of questionable organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=Stephen|title=Questionable Organizations: An Overview|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecorg.html|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2016 ISIS announced it was "terminating" activities due to the "serious illness" of Mae Wan Ho.  They noted, The "Institute of Science in Society website will remain as a static archive, but we will not be circulating any more reports beyond the end of March 2016."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-sis.org.uk/index.php ISIS "Termination Notice"], Institute of Science in Society statement, February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic engineering ==
Ho, together with Joe Cummins of the [[University of Western Ontario]], has argued that a sterility gene engineered into a crop could be transferred to other crops or wild relatives and that "This could severely compromise the agronomic performance of conventional crops and cause wild relatives to go extinct". They argued that this process could also produce genetic instabilities, which might be "leading to catastrophic breakdown", and stated that there are no data to assure that this has not happened or cannot happen.&lt;ref&gt;Donald MacLeod, "Who's listening? Will public opinion on genetically modified crops make any difference to the government?", ''The Guardian'', 19 May 2003. [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/may/19/gm.food Reprint]. Accessed 9 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This concern contrasts with the reason why these sterile plants were developed, which was to prevent the transfer of genes to the environment by preventing any plants that are bred with or that receive these genes from reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Daniell H |title=Molecular strategies for gene containment in transgenic crops |journal=Nat. Biotechnol. |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=581–6 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12042861 |doi=10.1038/nbt0602-581 |pmc=3471138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, any gene that caused sterility when transferred to a new species would be eliminated by [[natural selection]] and could not spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee D, Natesan E |title=Evaluating genetic containment strategies for transgenic plants |journal=Trends Biotechnol. |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=109–14 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16460821 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ho expressed concerns about the spread of altered genes through [[horizontal gene transfer]] and that the experimental alteration of genetic structures may be out of control. One of her concerns is that the [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotic resistant]] gene that was isolated from bacteria and used in some [[Genetically modified food|GM crops]] might cross back from plants by [[horizontal gene transfer]] to different species of bacteria, because "If this happened it would leave us unable to treat major illnesses like [[meningitis]] and ''[[Escherichia coli|E coli]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Antony Barnett, "GM genes 'jump species barrier', GM food: special report", ''The Guardian'', 28 May 2000. [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/may/28/gm.food Reprint].

Ho has also argued that bacteria could acquire the bacterial gene [[barnase]] from transgenic plants. This gene kills any cell that expresses it and lacks [[barstar]], the specific inhibitor of barnase activity. In an article entitled ''Chronicle of An Ecological Disaster Foretold'', which was published in an ISIS newsletter, Ho speculated that if a bacterium acquired the barnase gene and survived, this could make the bacteria a more dangerous pathogen.

==Evolution==

Ho has claimed that evolution is pluralistic and non-Darwinian because there are many mechanisms that can produce variation in phenotypes independently of [[natural selection]]. Ho has advocated a form of [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] evolution. She has been criticized by the [[scientific community]] for setting up [[straw man]] arguments in her criticism of natural selection and supporting discredited evolutionary theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas J. Futuyma|J. Futuyma, Douglas]]. (1984). ''Neo-Darwinism in Disfavor''. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.

Pollard; Beyond Neo-Darwinism: An Introduction to the New Evolutionary Paradigm by Mae-Wan Ho; Peter T. Saunders''. ''[[American Scientist]]''. Vol. 73, No. 6. p. 584.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[G.

The paleontologist [[Philip D. Gingerich|Philip Gingerich]] has noted that Ho's evolutionary ideas are based on [[Vitalism|vitalistic]] thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip D.

==Organization==
The informal organization is largely supported by teachers and students participating in "classroom projects, collaborative research" among other opportunities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Brad|last2=Taylor|first2=Orley|date=May 1996|title=Monarch migration|url=|journal=The Science Teacher|volume=63|issue=5|pages=26|issn=00368555|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founder and director is Orley R.

== Monarch Waystation Program ==
[[File:Monarch Waystation Sign.jpg|alt=Monarch Waystation Sign|thumb|Monarch Waystation Sign]]
The monarch butterfly is also known as the milkweed butterfly due to its subsistence on the [[Asclepias|milkweed plant]] for its habitat.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Brad|last2=Taylor|first2=Orley|date=May 1996|title=Monarch migration|url=|journal=The Science Teacher|volume=63|issue=5|pages=26|issn=00368555|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely due to commercial farming practices, the habitats of monarch butterflies have declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monarchwatch.org/waystations/|title=Monarch Watch : Monarch Waystation Program|last=jlovett@ku.edu|first=Jim Lovett -|website=monarchwatch.org|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to mitigate the destruction of the monarch butterflies natural habitat, Monarch Watch has called for volunteers to plant milkweed wherever possible.

== Bring Back the Monarchs Campaign ==
Monarch Watch is not only focused on tracking the fall migration of monarchs, but also on the conservation of the monarch butterfly through the preservation and restoration of monarch habitats.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monarchwatch.org/about/index.htm|title=Bring Back The Monarchs|last=|first=|date=|website=monarchwatch.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of habitats has negatively affected the monarch butterfly population as well as that of other [[Pollinator|pollinators]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Habitat shrinkage has resulted in the extinction of several species of pollinators over the last 50 years.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holzberg|first=Carol S.|date=Nov 1999|title=Monarch watch|url=|journal=Technology &amp; Learning|volume=20|issue=4|pages=46|issn=10536728|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monarch butterfly is also affected by parasites and the "declining winter habitat in Mexico."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Monarch Watch's efforts in this arena are specifically referred to at the "Bring Back the Monarchs Campaign."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Bring Back the Monarchs Campaign is an offshoot of the Monarch Waystation Program.

=== Milkweed Market ===
Beyond offering free [[Asclepias|milkweed]] plugs, Monarch Watch also offers a shop by which an individual can purchase milkweed for the purpose of creating monarch habitats. The milkweed species offered to the buyer is contingent on the buyer's zip code, in an effort to ensure that only native milkweed is planted in the appropriate regional areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monarchwatch.org/milkweed/market/|title=Monarch Watch Milkweed Market|website=monarchwatch.org|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4566">In [[mathematics]], a '''monogenic semigroup''' is a [[semigroup]] generated by a single element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howie|first=J M|title=An Introduction to Semigroup Theory|publisher=Academic Press|year=1976|series=L.M.S. Monographs|volume=7|pages=7&amp;ndash;11|isbn=0-12-356950-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monogenic semigroups are also called '''cyclic semigroups'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=A H Clifford|author2=G B Preston|title=The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups Vol.I|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=1961|series=Mathematical Surveys|volume=7|pages=19&amp;ndash;20|isbn=978-0821802724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The monogenic semigroup  generated by the [[singleton set]] { ''a'' } is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. The set of elements of &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is  { ''a'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ... }. There are two possibilities for the monogenic semigroup  &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt;:
*''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; =  ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rArr; ''m'' = ''n''.
*There exist ''m'' &amp;ne; ''n'' such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; =  ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
In the former case &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is [[isomorphic]] to the semigroup ( {1, 2, ... }, + ) of [[natural numbers]] under [[addition]]. In such a case, &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is an ''infinite monogenic semigroup'' and  the element ''a'' is said to have ''infinite order''. It is sometimes called the ''free monogenic semigroup'' because it is also a [[free semigroup]] with one generator.

In the latter case let ''m'' be the smallest positive integer such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; =  ''a'' &lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; for some positive integer ''x'' &amp;ne; ''m'', and let ''r'' be smallest positive integer such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; =  ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''r''&lt;/sup&gt;. The positive integer ''m'' is referred to as the '''index''' and the positive integer ''r'' as the '''period''' of the monogenic semigroup &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. The '''order''' of ''a'' is defined as ''m''+''r''-1. The period and the index satisfy the following properties:
*''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; =  ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''r''&lt;/sup&gt;
*''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''x''&lt;/sup&gt; =  ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''y''&lt;/sup&gt; if and only if ''m'' + ''x'' &amp;equiv;  ''m'' + ''y'' ( mod ''r'' )
*&lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt; = { ''a'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;, ... , ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''r'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt; }
*''K''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;, ... , ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''r'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt; } is a [[Cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] and also an [[Semigroup#Subsemigroups and ideals|ideal]] of &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. It is called the ''[[kernel of a semigroup|kernel]]'' of ''a'' and it is the [[minimal ideal]] of the monogenic semigroup &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Kernel_of_a_semi-group&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Minimal_ideal&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair ( ''m'', ''r'' ) of positive integers determine the [[structure]] of monogenic semigroups. For every pair ( ''m'', ''r'' ) of positive integers, there does exist a monogenic semigroup having index ''m'' and period ''r''.  The monogenic semigroup having index ''m'' and period ''r'' is denoted by ''M'' ( ''m'', ''r'' ). The monogenic semigroup ''M'' ( 1, ''r'' ) is the [[cyclic group]] of order ''r''.

The results in this section [[Semigroup#Structure of semigroups|actually hold]] for any element ''a'' of an arbitrary semigroup and the monogenic subsemigroup &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt; it generates.

== Related notions ==
A related notion is that of '''periodic semigroup''' (also called '''torsion semigroup'''), in which every element has finite order (or, equivalently, in which every mongenic subsemigroup is finite). A more general class is that of quasi-periodic semigroups (aka group-bound semigroups or [[epigroup]]s) in which every element of the semigroup has a power that lies in a subgroup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Periodic_semi-group&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Higgins1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter M. Higgins|title=Techniques of semigroup theory|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-853577-5|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[aperiodic semigroup]] is one in which every monogenic subsemigroup has a period of 1.

== Buddhism ==
''Nidana'' doctrines of [[Buddhism]] are attributed to [[Shakyamuni]] Buddha.{{cn|date=May 2016}} It has two specific meanings. The more common use refers to the [[Twelve nidanas]] or ''"a concatenation of cause and effect"'', which is the cycle of rebirth as described by [[Gautama]] upon which a re-becoming is thought by [[Buddhist]]s to rest, which is also called the twelve links of '[[Dependent Origination|dependent origination]]'.&lt;ref name=peterharvey12links/&gt;

The term is also less commonly used with reference to the [[jhana]]s or stages of [[Buddhist]] meditation. The [[Twelve nidanas]] of [[samsara]] describe the stages of successive [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirths]], based upon ignorance, while the nidana of the jhanas, by contrast, arises from spiritual practice.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

An important example of ''nidanas'' in Buddhism, is the ''[[Twelve Nidānas]]'' doctrine where each link is asserted as a primary causal relationship between the connected links.&lt;ref name=peterharvey12links&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|editor=Steven M. Emmanuel|title=A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_lmCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-14466-3|pages=50–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

== Hinduism ==
The term ''Nidana'' appears in numerous ancient and medieval Hindu texts wherein it means "first cause, primary cause, original or essential cause".&lt;ref name=mmwp486/&gt; This includes the [[Upanishads]] that include theosophical speculations,&lt;ref name=mmwp486/&gt; as well as medical texts such as [[Sushruta Samhita]] and [[Charaka Samhita]] where a large sub-book is titled ''Nidana-sthana'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Malavika Kapur |title=Psychological Perspectives on Childcare in Indian Indigenous Health Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_7r-CQAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-81-322-2428-0 |pages=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in chapters of the [[Puranas]], wherein these discuss cause of disease or various natural phenomena.&lt;ref name=mmwp486/&gt;

The '''northern spotted owl''' (''Strix occidentalis caurina'') is one of three [[spotted owl]] [[subspecies]]. A western [[North America]]n bird in the family [[Strigidae]], genus ''[[Strix (genus)|Strix]]'', it is a medium-sized dark brown owl sixteen to nineteen inches in length and one to one and one sixth pounds. Females are larger than males. The wingspan is  approximately 42 inches.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern spotted owl primarily inhabits [[old growth forests]] in the northern part of its range ([[Canada]] to southern [[Oregon]]) and landscapes with a mix of old and younger forest types in the southern part of its range (Klamath region and [[California]]). The subspecies' range is the [[Pacific]] coast from extreme southern [[British Columbia]] to [[Marin County]] in northern California. It nests in cavities or on platforms in large trees and will use abandoned nests of other species. Spotted owls form long-term pair bonds (divorce is an uncommon occurrence) and remain in the same geographical areas year after year.

Most spotted owls inhabit federal lands ([[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]], [[Bureau of Land Management]], and [[National Park Service]] lands), although significant numbers occur on state lands in all three states, and on private and tribal properties.

==Diet==
The northern spotted owl is primarily nocturnal. Its diet consists mainly of wood rats (Neotoma sp.) and [[flying squirrel]]s, although it will also eat other small mammals, reptiles, birds and insects. They will often swallow their catch whole and regurgitate pellets of indigestible hair, feathers and bones. Males and females both hunt, except during nesting, when males do most of the hunting. They can take prey on the ground and in flight.
Northern spotted owls are one of the few owls with dark-colored eyes. Most owls have yellow to red-orange colored eyes.

==Behavior==
The northern spotted owl is intolerant of habitat disturbance. Each nesting pair needs a large amount of land for hunting and nesting, and will not migrate unless they experience drastic seasonal changes, such as heavy snows, which make hunting difficult. Their flight pattern is distinct, involving a series of rapid wingbeats interspersed with [[gliding (flight)|gliding flight]]. This technique allows them to glide silently down upon their prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Reproduction==
Northern spotted owls are ready to reproduce at two years of age, but do not typically breed until they are three years old. Male and females mate in February or March and the female lays two or three eggs in March or April. She then incubates the eggs for 30 days. After hatching, the young owls remain in the nest where the adult female provides primary care until they fledge in 34 to 36 days. The hunting and feeding is done by the male during this time. The young owls remain with the parents until late summer to early fall. They leave the nest and form their own winter feeding range. By spring, the young owls' territory will be from 2 to 24 miles from the parents.&lt;ref name="Does Anybody Give a Hoot"&gt;Brokaw, Jeanne (Nov/Dec 1996).

==Conservation status==
There are fewer than 100 pairs of Northern Spotted Owl left in British Columbia, Canada, 1,200 pairs in Oregon, 560 pairs in Northern California, and 500 pairs in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The worldwide [[IUCN Red List]] of Threatened Species status for the spotted owl species is "[[Near Threatened]]" with a decreasing population trend.&lt;ref&gt;BirdLife International (2013) [http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22689089/0 ''Strix occidentalis'']. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2014.3.&lt;/ref&gt; As the IUCN Red List does not track subspecies, this status is applied to species across its whole range in Canada, the United States and Mexico.

The Canadian population, declared endangered by the [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] under the 2002 [[Species at Risk Act]], now{{when|date=June 2014}} numbers less than 100 breeding pairs of birds. In British Columbia, Canada, {{as of|2010|lc=y}}, only 6 pairs are known in the wild, down from historic numbers of 500 pairs.&lt;ref name='vansun'&gt;{{cite news|author=Pynn, Larry |publisher=The Vancouver Sun |date=March 24, 2010 |title=Light dims on B.C.'s wild spotted owls |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Light+dims+wild+spotted+owls/2722270/story.html |accessdate=March 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328205802/http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Light+dims+wild+spotted+owls/2722270/story.html |archivedate=March 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern spotted owl was listed as a [[threatened species]] under the [[Endangered Species Act]] throughout its range of northern California, Oregon and Washington by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] on June 23, 1990&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register 55 FR 26114-26194. [http://www.fws.gov/pacific/ecoservices/endangered/recovery/pdf/NSO_5-yr_Summary.pdf  Northern Spotted Owl Five-year Review] at U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.&lt;/ref&gt; citing loss of [[Old-growth forest|old-growth habitat]] as the primary threat. The USFWS previously reviewed the status of the northern spotted owl in 1982, 1987 and 1989 but found it did not warrant listing as either threatened or endangered. Logging in [[United States National Forest|national forests]] containing the northern spotted owl was stopped by court order in 1991.&lt;ref name="Does Anybody Give a Hoot"/&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
[[File:NorthernSpottedOwlOregonZoo.jpg|thumb|left|Northern spotted owl, [[Oregon Zoo]], [[Portland, Oregon]]]]
In 2007 a Captive Breeding and Release Program was created in Langley, British Columbia, Canada, with the goal of producing owls in captivity for release into protected habitat to prevent the extirpation of the species from Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsobreedingprogram.com Northern Spotted Owl Breeding Program ]&lt;/ref&gt; The short-term goals of the Program include growing the captive population to 10 breeding pairs and releasing 10-20 offspring per year into the 300,000 hectares of protected old-growth forest. Long-term the Breeding Program aims to recover the wild population to self-sustaining numbers, approximately 300 adults, over the next 10–20 years. Thus far the Program has produced 8 captive-bred Northern Spotted Owls, including 2 second-generation offspring, and plans to begin releases in 2018 or 2019.

==Controversy==
In 1990, the logging industry estimated up to 30,000 of 168,000 jobs would be lost because of the owl's status, which agreed closely with a Forest Service estimate.&lt;ref name='satchell'&gt;Satchell, M. (June 25, 1990) ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'', Vol. 108, Issue 25, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Harvests of timber in the Pacific Northwest were reduced by 80%, decreasing the supply of lumber and increasing prices.&lt;ref name="Does Anybody Give a Hoot"/&gt; However, jobs were already declining because of dwindling old-growth forest harvests and automation of the lumber industry.&lt;ref name='satchell'/&gt; One study at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] by environmental scientists argued that logging jobs had been in a long decline and that environmental protection was not a significant factor in job loss.&lt;ref&gt;
  {{cite journal|last=Freudenburg |first=William R. |author2=Lisa J. Wilson |author3=Daniel O'Leary |year=1998 |title=Forty Years of Spotted Owls? A Longitudinal Analysis of Logging-Industry Job Losses |journal=Sociological Perspectives |volume=41 |issue=#1 |pages=1–26 |url=http://www.es.ucsb.edu/faculty/freudenburg_pdf%27s/40yrsSpottedOwls.pdf |accessdate=November 12, 2008 |doi=10.2307/1389351 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830195041/http://www.es.ucsb.edu/faculty/freudenburg_pdf%27s/40yrsSpottedOwls.pdf |archivedate=August 30, 2006 |jstor=1389351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1947 to 1964, the number of logging jobs declined 90%. Starting with the [[Wilderness Act]] of 1964, environmental protection saved 51,000 jobs in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Guglielmino, Janine (Summer 1997). ''American Forests'', Vol. 103, Issue 2, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy pitted individual loggers and small sawmill owners against environmentalists. Bumper stickers reading ''Kill a Spotted Owl—Save a Logger'' and ''I Like Spotted Owls—Fried'' appeared to support the loggers.&lt;ref name='satchell'/&gt; Plastic spotted owls were hung in effigy in Oregon sawmills.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Larry (December 1999). ''Wood &amp; Wood Products'', Vol. 104, Issue 13, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The logging industry, in response to continued bad publicity, started the Sustainable Forestry Initiative.&lt;ref name='Sustainable Forestry Initiative'&gt;[http://www.aboutsfi.org/ Sustainable Forestry Initiative]. aboutsfi.org&lt;/ref&gt; While timber interests and conservatives have cited the northern spotted owl as an example of excessive or misguided environmental protection, many environmentalists view the owl as an "[[indicator species]]," or "canary in a coal mine" whose preservation has created protection for an entire threatened ecosystem.&lt;ref name="AmLands"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanlands.org/issues.php?subsubNo=1089232287&amp;article=1179268431&amp;PHPSESSID=ab0b4467aa4d0c7ec783288fde180221 |title=American Lands Alliance Action Alert |date=May 15, 2007 |publisher=Americanlands.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613212741/http://www.americanlands.org/issues.php?subsubNo=1089232287&amp;article=1179268431&amp;PHPSESSID=ab0b4467aa4d0c7ec783288fde180221 |archivedate=June 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protection of the owl, under both the Endangered Species Act and the National Forest Management Act, has led to significant changes in forest practices in the northwest. President Clinton's controversial [[Northwest Forest Plan]] of 1994 was designed primarily to protect owls and other species dependent on old-growth forests while ensuring a certain amount of timber harvest. Although the result was much less logging, industry automation and the new law meant the loss of thousands of jobs.&lt;ref name="csm"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0627/p02s01-sten.html|title = Northern spotted owl's decline revives old concerns|date = June 27, 2007|publisher = Christian Science Monitor|author = Knickerbocker, Brad|accessdate = June 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new jobs were created for biologists conducting surveys for spotted owls and other rare organisms that occur in their range.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The debate has cooled somewhat over the years, with little response from environmentalists as the owl's population continues to decline by 7.3 percent per year.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.olympicpeninsulaaudubon.org/shell.php?page=conserve_barred_owl How Should We Manage the Barred Owl?]" ''Olympic Peninsula Audubon Society.'' Accessed April 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] reaffirmed that the owl remained threatened, but indicated that invasion by [[barred owl]]s into the range and habitat of the spotted owl was also a cause of declining spotted owl populations.

In 2007, the USFWS proposed a new recovery plan intended to guide all management actions on lands where spotted owls occur, and to aid in recovery of the species. Early proposals were criticized by environmental groups as significantly weakening existing protections for the species. The Obama administration reversed proposals that would have increased logging on Bureau of Land Management administered lands. Recent discussion has been focused on two novel approaches. One of these would emphasize wildfire management as key to owl persistence on the east side of the Cascades, and in the Klamath province. Another proposal, on control of [[barred owl]] populations through culling,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson DH, White GC, Franklin AB, Diller LV, Blackburn I, Pierce DJ, Olson GS, Buchanan JB, Thrailkill J, Woodbridge B, Ostwald M. (2008). ''Study designs for Barred Owl removal experiments to evaluate potential effects on Northern Spotted Owls''. Report prepared for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Lacey, WA and Yreka, CA. Olympia, WA: Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. 32 p.&lt;/ref&gt; has been criticized by some animal rights and other activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Verhovek, Sam Howe |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=June 4, 2007 |title=To protect spotted owl, larger rival is targeted |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-owls4jun04,1,7172559.story?track=rss&amp;ctrack=2&amp;cset=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal biologists were considering in 2010 whether to kill barred owls to see if that would help the spotted owls.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Jeff (December 10, 2009).

== Relations with tribes ==
Northern Spotted Owls range on 500,000 acres of the 7.6 percent of private forestlands managed by Native American tribes in the state of Washington. The U.S. treats tribes as sovereign nations, therefore each tribe develops their own management plans for the northern spotted owls in their area. However, the government expects all private land owners (including native tribes) to comply with the Endangered Species Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2590">An '''obligation''' is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether [[legal obligation|legal]] or [[moral obligation|moral]].  There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as obligations of [[etiquette]], [[social]] obligations, [[religious]] and possibly in terms of [[politics]], where obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled. These are generally [[legal]] obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfilment, although certain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as well, whether as a [[tradition]] or for social reasons.

Obligations vary from person to person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have far more obligations than an average adult citizen, who themselves will have more obligations than a child.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bear, ''Sacred Journey of the Medicine Wheel'' (2008), p. 393: "Adults have more obligations and are held to higher standards of accountability than children are".&lt;/ref&gt; Obligations are generally granted in return for an increase in an individual's rights or power.  For example, obligations for health and safety in a workplace from employer to employee maybe to ensure the fire exit is not blocked or ensure that the plugs are put in firmly.

The word "obligation" can also designate a written obligation, or such things as bank notes, coins, checks, bonds, stamps, or securities.

==Other uses==
The term obligate can also be used in a biological context, in reference to species which must occupy a certain niche or behave in a certain way in order to survive. In biology, the opposite of obligate is [[facultative]], meaning that a species is able to behave in a certain way and may do so under certain circumstances, but that it can also survive without having to behave this way. For example, species of salamanders in the family [[Proteidae]] are obligate [[paedomorphs]], whereas species belonging to the [[Ambystomatidae]] are facultative paedomorphs.

In the Catholic Church, [[Holy Days of Obligation]] or Holidays of Obligation, less commonly called Feasts of Precept, are the days on which, as canon 1247 of the [[Code of Canon Law]] states, the faithful are obliged to participate in the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12773">The '''obsolete Finnish units of measurement''' consist mostly of a variety of units traditionally used in [[Finland]] that are similar to those that were traditionally used in other countries and are still used in the United Kingdom ([[imperial units]]) and the United States ([[United States customary units]]).

Very few of these units are sometimes still used in everyday speech and even when buying and measuring things as shorthand for similar amounts in the metric system. For example, ''kappa'' (sometimes called ''isokappa'') is still used at markets to measure exactly 5 liters of potatoes. When ordering firewood, some customers (and even dealers) use ''syli'' to refer to a cubic meter, but some old people use the term to refer to various much larger amounts of firewood.

Most Finnish obsolete units of measurement were identical to [[Swedish units of measurement]], including units of length being based on the Swedish "foot" (29.69&amp;nbsp;cm) that was defined in 1605, since Finland was part of Sweden from the Middle Ages to 1809, but later some [[Obsolete Russian weights and measures|Russian]] units were also used.

The measurements were first standardized by law in 1665 and were revised in 1735. Before this, measurements often varied between towns. The king's bailiff in the town of [[Porvoo]], for example, used two sets of measures: a big one for collecting tax in kind from the populace and a smaller set to remit the assets to the king, keeping the difference for himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} However, nowadays the proverb ''mitata Porvoon mitalla'' (to measure in Porvoo units) has a positive meaning of measuring in excess or generously.

Certain units were standardized to the [[metric system]] in 1861, and Finland fully converted to the metric system in 1880.

[[Image:IngresOdipusAndSphinx.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Oedipus]] describes the riddle of the [[Sphinx]]'', by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], (ca. 1805).]]
The '''Oedipus complex''' (also spelled '''Œdipus complex''') is a concept of [[psychoanalytic theory]]. [[Sigmund Freud]] introduced the concept in his ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams|Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899) and coined the expression in his ''A Special Type of Choice of Object made by Men'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Oedipus complex (pp. 64ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=_tcUbPPdf8AC&amp;pg=PA64 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Libido Theory |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_tcUbPPdf8AC&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2012 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=iD1qAAAAMAAJ 1969] |publisher=Karnac Books |location=London |isbn=1-78181098-2 |id={{ISBN|978-1-781-81098-9}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LP"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Laplanche |first2=Jean-Bertrand |last2=Pontalis |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |chapter=Oedipus complex (pp. 282ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=%22Oedipus+complex%22 |title=The Language of Psycho-analysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Karnac Books| location=London |year=1988 |edition=reprint, revised |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |id={{ISBN|0-94643949-4}} |isbn=978-0-946-43949-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive Oedipus complex refers to a child's [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] sexual desire for the opposite-sex parent and hatred for the same-sex parent. The negative Oedipus complex refers to a child's unconscious sexual desire for the same-sex parent and hatred for the opposite-sex parent.&lt;ref name="LP"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Auchincloss&gt;{{cite book | last=Auchincloss, M. D. | first=Elizabeth | title=The Psychoanalytic Model of the Mind| year=2015 | publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Auchincloss2&gt;{{cite book | last=Auchincloss M. D. | first=Elizabeth | title=Psychoanalytic Terms and Concepts| year=2012 | publisher=American Psychoanalytic Association |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud considered that the child's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful outcome of the complex and that unsuccessful outcome of the complex might lead to [[neurosis]], [[pedophilia]], and [[homosexuality]].

Freud deprecated the term "[[Electra complex]]", which was introduced by [[Carl Gustav Jung]] in 1913 in regard to the Oedipus complex manifested in young girls. Freud further proposed that the Oedipus complex, which originally refers to the sexual desire of a son for his mother, is a desire for the parent in both males and females, and that boys and girls experience the complex differently: boys in a form of [[castration anxiety]], girls in a form of [[penis envy]].

==Background==
[[Image:AmaliaFreud.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Ego psychology|psychologist]] [[Sigmund Freud]] (at age 16) with his mother in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay (1995) ''[[Freud: A Life for Our Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

''Oedipus'' refers to a 5th-century BC [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] character [[Oedipus]], who unwittingly kills his father, [[Laius]], and marries his mother, [[Jocasta]]. A play based on the myth, ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', was written by [[Sophocles]], ca. 429 BC.

Modern productions of Sophocles' play were staged in Paris and Vienna in the 19th century and were phenomenally successful in the 1880s and 1890s. The Austrian [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]], [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939), attended. In his book ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' first published in 1899, he proposed that an Oedipal desire is a universal, psychological phenomenon innate ([[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]]) to human beings, and the cause of much unconscious guilt. Freud believed that the Oedipal sentiment has been inherited through the millions of years it took for humans to evolve from apes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Basic Freud: Psychoanalytic Thought for the 21st Century|last=Khan|first=Michael|publisher=Basic Books|year=2002|isbn=0-465-03715-1|location=New York, NY|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; He based this on his analysis of his feelings attending the play, his anecdotal observations of neurotic or normal children, and on the fact that '' Oedipus Rex'' was effective on both ancient and modern audiences. (He also claimed that the play ''[[Hamlet]]'' "has its roots in the same soil as ''Oedipus Rex''", and that the differences between the two plays are revealing. "In [''Oedipus Rex''] the child’s wishful fantasy that underlies it is brought into the open and realized as it would be in a dream. In ''Hamlet'' it remains repressed; and—just as in the case of a neurosis—we only learn of its existence from its inhibiting consequences.")&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''The Interpretation of Dreams''. Basic Books. 978-0465019779 (2010) page 282.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psyartjournal.com/article/show/armstrong-oedipus_as_evidence_the_theatrical_backg Oedipus as Evidence: The Theatrical Background to Freud's Oedipus Complex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418115325/http://www.psyartjournal.com/article/show/armstrong-oedipus_as_evidence_the_theatrical_backg |date=2013-04-18 }} by Richard Armstrong, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in ''The Interpretation of Dreams'', Freud makes it clear that the "primordial urges and fears" that are his concern and the basis of the Oedipal complex are inherent in the myths the play by Sophocles is based on, not primarily in the play itself, which Freud refers to as a "further modification of the legend" that originates in a "misconceived secondary revision of the material, which has sought to exploit it for theological purposes".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund.

A six-stage chronology of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theoretic evolution of the Oedipus complex is:

*Stage 1. 1897–1909. After his father's death in 1896, and having seen the play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', by [[Sophocles]], Freud begins using the term "Oedipus". As Freud wrote in an 1897 letter, "I found in myself a constant love for my mother, and jealousy of my father. I now consider this to be a universal event in early childhood. 
*Stage 2. 1909–1914. Proposes that Oedipal [[libido|desire]] is the "nuclear complex" of all neuroses; first usage of "Oedipus complex" in 1910.
*Stage 3. 1914–1918. Considers paternal and maternal [[incest]].
*Stage 4. 1919–1926. Complete Oedipus complex; [[identification (psychology)|identification]] and [[bisexuality]] are conceptually evident in later works.
*Stage 5. 1926–1931. Applies the Oedipal theory to religion and [[Norm (social)|custom]].
*Stage 6. 1931–1938. Investigates the "feminine Oedipus attitude" and "negative Oedipus complex"; later the "Electra complex".&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Simon, Rachel B. Blass "The development of vicissitudes of Freud's ideas on the Oedipus complex" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Freud'' (University of California Press 1991) p.000&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Oedipus complex===
[[File:Oedipus and the Sphinx MET DP-14201-023.jpg|thumb|upright|''Oedipus and the Sphinx'', by  [[Gustave Moreau]] (1864)]]
In classical [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory, the Oedipus complex occurs during the [[phallic stage]] of [[psychosexual development]] (age 3–6 years), when also occurs the formation of the [[libido]] and the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]; yet it might manifest itself at an earlier age.&lt;ref name="JosephChilders"&gt;Joseph Childers, Gary Hentzi eds. ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism''  (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rycroft ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London, 2nd ed., 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[phallic stage]], a boy's decisive psychosexual experience is the Oedipus complex—his son–father competition for possession of mother. It is in this third stage of [[psychosexual development]] that the child's genitalia is his or her primary [[erogenous zone]]; thus, when children become aware of their bodies, the bodies of other children, and the bodies of their parents, they gratify physical curiosity by undressing and exploring themselves, each other, and their genitals, so learning the [[Human anatomy|anatomic]] differences between "male" and "female" and the [[gender]] differences between "boy" and "girl".

''Psychosexual infantilism''—Despite mother being the parent who primarily gratifies the child's [[Libido|desires]], the child begins forming a discrete sexual identity—"boy", "girl"—that alters the dynamics of the parent and child relationship; the parents become objects of infantile [[Libido|libidinal]] energy. The boy directs his libido (sexual desire) upon his mother and directs jealousy and emotional rivalry against his father—because it is he who sleeps with his mother. Moreover, to facilitate union with mother, the boy's [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]] wants to kill father (as did [[Oedipus]]), but the pragmatic [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]], based upon the [[reality principle]], knows that the father is the stronger of the two males competing to possess the one female. Nonetheless, the boy remains ambivalent about his father's place in the family, which is manifested as [[castration anxiety|fear of castration]] by the physically greater father; the fear is an irrational, subconscious manifestation of the infantile id.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bullock, Stephen Trombley ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (London:Harper Collins 1999)  pp. 607, 705&lt;/ref&gt;

''Psycho-logic defense''—In both sexes, [[defense mechanism]]s provide transitory resolutions of the conflict between the drives of the id and the drives of the ego. The first defense mechanism is [[Psychological repression|repression]], the blocking of memories, emotional impulses, and ideas from the conscious mind; yet its action does not resolve the id–ego conflict. The second defense mechanism is [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], in which the boy or girl child adapts by incorporating, to his or her (super)ego, the personality characteristics of the same-sex parent. As a result of this, the boy diminishes his [[castration anxiety]], because his likeness to father protects him from father's wrath in their maternal rivalry. In the case of the girl, this facilitates identifying with mother, who understands that, in being females, neither of them possesses a penis, and thus are not antagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bullock, Stephen Trombley ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (London:Harper Collins 1999) pp. 205, 107&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dénouement''—Unresolved son–father competition for the psycho-sexual possession of the mother might result in a [[phallic stage]] [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] that leads to the boy becoming an aggressive, over-ambitious, and vain man. Therefore, the satisfactory parental handling and resolution of the Oedipus complex are most important in developing the male infantile [[super-ego]]. This is because, by identifying with a parent, the boy [[Internalization|internalizes]] [[Morality]]; thereby, he chooses to comply with societal rules, rather than reflexively complying in fear of punishment.

===Oedipal case study===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Sigmund Freud]] --&gt;
[[Image:1869 Frederic Leighton - Electra at the Tomb of Agamemnon.jpg|thumb|upright|Female Oedipus attitude: ''Electra at the Tomb of [[Agamemnon]]'', by [[Frederic Leighton]], (c.1869).]]
In ''Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-year-old Boy'' (1909), the case study of the [[Equinophobia|equinophobic]] boy "[[Little Hans]]", Freud showed that the relation between Hans's fears—of horses and of his father—derived from external factors, the birth of a sister, and internal factors, the desire of the infantile id to replace father as companion to mother, and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for enjoying the [[masturbation]] normal to a boy of his age. Moreover, his admitting to wanting to procreate with mother was considered proof of the boy's [[Libido|sexual attraction]] to the opposite-sex parent; he was a heterosexual male. Yet, the boy Hans was unable to relate fearing horses to fearing his father. As the treating [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], Freud noted that "Hans had to be told many things that he could not say himself" and that "he had to be presented with thoughts, which he had, so far, shown no signs of possessing".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Cioffi (2005) "Sigmund Freud" entry ''The Oxford Guide to Philosophy'' Oxford University Press:New York pp. 323–324&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Freud equally applied the Oedipus complex to the [[psychosexual development]] of boys and girls, but later modified the female aspects of the theory as "feminine Oedipus attitude" and "negative Oedipus complex";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freud|first=Sigmund |authorlink=Sigmund Freud|title=On Sexuality |year=1956 |publisher=Penguin Books Ltd |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; yet, it was his student–collaborator [[Carl Jung]], who, in 1913, proposed the [[Electra complex]] to describe a girl's daughter–mother competition for psychosexual possession of the father.&lt;ref name="www.credoreference.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/topic/freud_sigmund_1856_1939?searchId=67d623b9-ceca-11e4-9c20-0aea1e24c1ac |title=Freud, Sigmund (1856-1939) |publisher=credoreference.com |accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[phallic stage]], a girl's Electra complex is her decisive [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] experience in forming a discrete sexual identity ([[Ego (Freudian)|ego]]). Whereas a boy develops [[castration anxiety]], a girl develops [[penis envy]] rooted in anatomic fact: without a penis, she cannot sexually possess mother, as the infantile id demands. Resultantly, the girl redirects her [[libido|desire]] for sexual union upon father, thus progressing to [[heterosexual]] femininity, which culminates in bearing a child, who replaces the absent [[penis]].&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesisi &amp; Forrester (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after the phallic stage, the girl's psychosexual development includes transferring her primary erogenous zone from the infantile [[clitoris]] to the adult [[vagina]].

Freud thus considered a girl's negative Oedipus complex to be more emotionally intense than that of a boy, resulting, potentially, in a woman of submissive, insecure [[Id, ego and super-ego|personality]];&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bullock, Stephen Trombley ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Harper Collins:London (1999) pp. 259, 705&lt;/ref&gt; thus might an unresolved Electra complex, daughter–mother competition for psychosexual possession of father, lead to a phallic-stage [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] conducive to a girl becoming a woman who continually strives to dominate men (viz. [[penis envy]]), either as an unusually [[Femme fatale|seductive woman]] (high self-esteem) or as an unusually submissive woman (low self-esteem). Therefore, the satisfactory parental handling and resolution of the Electra complex are most important in developing the female infantile [[super-ego]], because, by identifying with a parent, the girl internalizes [[morality]]; thereby, she chooses to comply with societal rules, rather than reflexively complying in fear of punishment.

===In regard to narcissism===
In regard to [[narcissism]], the Oedipus complex is viewed as the pinnacle of the individual's maturational striving for success or for love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pederson|first1=Trevor|title=The Economics of Libido: Psychic Bisexuality, the Superego, and the Centrality of the Oedipus Complex|date=2015|publisher=karnac}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Economic Problem of Masochism'' (1924), Freud writes that in "the Oedipus complex... [the parent's] personal significance for the superego recedes into the background' and 'the imagos they leave behind... link [to] the influences of teachers and authorities...". Educators and mentors are put in the ego ideal of the individual and they strive to take on their knowledge, skills, or insights.

In ''Some Reflections on Schoolboy Psychology'' (1914), Freud writes:
:"We can now understand our relation to our schoolmasters. These men, not all of whom were in fact fathers themselves, became our substitute fathers. That was why, even though they were still quite young, they struck us as so mature and so unattainably adult. We transferred on to them the respect and expectations attaching to the omniscient father of our childhood, and we then began to treat them as we treated our fathers at home. We confronted them with the ambivalence that we had acquired in our own families and with its help, we struggled with them as we had been in the habit of struggling with our fathers..."

The Oedipus complex, in narcissistic terms, represents that an individual can lose the ability to take a parental-substitute into his [[ego ideal]] without ambivalence. Once the individual has ambivalent relations with parental-substitutes, he will enter into the triangulating castration complex. In the castration complex the individual becomes rivalrous with parental-substitutes and this will be the point of regression. In ''Psycho-analytic notes on an autobiographical account of a case of paranoia (Dementia paranoides)'' (1911), Freud writes that "disappointment over a woman" (object drives) or "a mishap in social relations with other men" (ego drives) is the cause of regression or symptom formation. Triangulation can take place with a romantic rival, for a woman, or with a work rival, for the reputation of being more potent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pederson|first1=Trevor|title=The Economics of Libido: Psychic Bisexuality, the Superego, and the Centrality of the Oedipus Complex|date=2015|publisher=Karnac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freudian theoretic revision==
When [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939) proposed that the Oedipus complex was psychologically universal, he provoked the evolution of [[Ego psychology|Freudian psychology]] and the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] treatment method, by collaborators and competitors alike.

===Carl Gustav Jung===
[[Image:Electra and Orestes - Project Gutenberg eText 14994.png|thumb|left|The Electra complex: the [[matricide]]s Electra and Orestes.]]

In countering Freud's proposal that the [[psychosexual development]] of boys and girls is equal, i.e. equally oriented – that each initially experiences sexual desire ([[libido]]) for mother, and aggression towards father, student–collaborator [[Carl Jung]] counter-proposed that girls experienced desire for father and aggression towards mother via the [[Electra complex]]{{citation needed|reason=Where did Jung write about this? What primary text from Jung?|date=January 2016}}—derived from the 5th-century BC Greek mythologic character [[Electra]], who plotted [[Matricide|matricidal]] revenge with [[Orestes]], her brother, against [[Clytemnestra]], their mother, and [[Aegisthus]], their stepfather, for their murder of [[Agamemnon]], her father (cf. ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', by Sophocles).&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Bruce (1996). ''Benét's Reader's Encyclopedia'' Fourth edition, HarperCollins Publishers:New York p. 310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Robert E. (1991) ''Women of Classical Mythology: A Biographical Dictionary'' Oxford University Press:California pp.177–78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, S., Spawforth, A. (1998) ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization'' pp. 254–55&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, because it is native to [[Ego psychology|Freudian psychology]], orthodox Jungian psychology uses the term "Oedipus complex" only to denote a boy's psychosexual development.

===Otto Rank===
[[File:Freud and other psychoanalysts 1922.jpg|thumb|Oedipus complex: [[Otto Rank]] behind [[Sigmund Freud]], and other psychoanalysts (1922).]]

In classical [[Ego psychology|Freudian psychology]] the [[super-ego]], "the heir to the Oedipus complex", is formed as the infant boy [[Internalization|internalizes]] the familial rules of his father. In contrast, in the early 1920s, using the term "pre-Oedipal", [[Otto Rank]] proposed that a boy's powerful mother was the source of the super-ego, in the course of normal [[psychosexual development]]. Rank's theoretic conflict with Freud excluded him from the Freudian inner circle; nonetheless, he later developed the [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] [[Object relations theory]] in 1925.

===Melanie Klein===
Whereas Freud proposed that father (the paternal phallus) was central to infantile and adult [[psychosexual development]], [[Melanie Klein]] concentrated upon the early maternal relationship, proposing that Oedipal manifestations are perceptible in the first year of life, the [[oral stage]]. Her proposal was part of the "[[controversial discussions]]" (1942–44) at the British Psychoanalytical Association. The Kleinian psychologists proposed that "underlying the Oedipus complex, as Freud described it ... there is an earlier layer of more primitive relationships with the Oedipal couple".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi ed. ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  She assigned “dangerous destructive tendencies not just to the father but also to the mother in her discussion of the child’s projective fantasies”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, Klein's work lessened the central role of the Oedipus complex, with the concept of the [[depressive position]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rycroft ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''
(London, 2nd Edn, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilfred Bion===
[[File:Wilfred Bion 1916.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Wilfred Bion]] (1916)]]
"For the post–[[Melanie Klein|Kleinian]] [[Wilfred Bion|Bion]], the myth of Oedipus concerns investigatory curiosity—the quest for knowledge—rather than sexual difference; the other main character in the Oedipal drama becomes [[Tiresias]] (the false hypothesis erected against [[anxiety]] about a new theory)".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis'' (London 2005) p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Resultantly, "Bion regarded the central crime of Oedipus as his insistence on knowing the truth at all costs".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacques Lacan===
From the [[postmodern]] perspective, [[Jacques Lacan]] argued against removing the Oedipus complex from the center of psychosexual developmental experience. He considered "the Oedipus complex—in so far as we continue to recognize it as covering the whole field of our experience with its signification ... [that] superimposes the kingdom of culture" upon the person, marking his or her introduction to [[symbolic order]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus "a child learns what [[Power (philosophy)|power]] independent of itself is as it goes through the Oedipus complex ... encountering the existence of a symbolic system independent of itself".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Parker, ''Japan in Analysis'' (Basingstoke 2008) pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Lacan's proposal that "the ternary relation of the Oedipus complex" liberates the "prisoner of the dual relationship" of the son–mother relationship proved useful to later psychoanalysts;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits'' pp. 218, 182&lt;/ref&gt; thus, for [[Bollas]], the "achievement" of the Oedipus complex is that the "child comes to understand something about the oddity of possessing one's own [[mind]] ... discovers the multiplicity of points of view".&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, for Ronald Britton, "if the link between the parents perceived in love and hate can be tolerated in the child's mind ... this provides us with a capacity for seeing us in interaction with others, and ... for reflecting on ourselves, whilst being ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Wood ''On a Darkling Plain: Journey into the Unconscious'' (Cambridge 2002) "Ronald Britton" entry p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; As such, in ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (2000), Michael Parsons proposed that such a perspective permits viewing "the Oedipus complex as a life-long developmental challenge ... [with] new kinds of Oedipal configurations that belong to later life".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote that "with the progress of [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] studies the importance of the Oedipus complex has become, more and more, clearly evident; its recognition has become the ''shibboleth'' that distinguishes the adherents of psychoanalysis from its opponents";&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Sexuality'' pp. 149-50nn&lt;/ref&gt; thereby it remained a theoretic cornerstone of psychoanalysis until about 1930, when psychoanalysts began investigating the pre-Oedipal son–mother relationship within the theory of [[psychosexual development]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rycroft ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''
(London, 2nd Ed., 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Janet Malcolm reports that by the late 20th century, to the object relations psychology "[[avant-garde]], the events of the Oedipal period are pallid and inconsequential, in comparison with the cliff-hanging [[psychodrama]]s of infancy. ... For [[Kohut]], as for [[Winnicott]] and [[Balint]], the Oedipus complex is an irrelevance in the treatment of severe [[psychopathology|pathology]]".&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) pp. 35, 136&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, [[ego psychology]] continued to maintain that "the Oedipal period—roughly three-and-a-half to six years—is like [[Konrad Lorenz|Lorenz]] standing in front of the chick, it is the most formative, significant, moulding experience of human life ... If you take a person's adult life—his love, his work, his hobbies, his ambitions—they all point back to the Oedipus complex".&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988), "Aaron Green", pp. 158–59 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5_9492Mhn_IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Malcolm,+Psychoanalysis:+The+Impossible+Profession+Aaron+Green%22,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIr_6Bq9qIyQIVi7YeCh0aqAZk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
According to Armand Chatard, Freudian representation of the Oedipus complex is little or not at all supported by empirical data (he relies on Kagan, 1964, Bussey and Bandura, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chatard|first1=Armand|date=September 2004|title=La construction sociale du genre|url=http://www2.cndp.fr/archivage/valid/66975/66975-10067-12590.pdf|journal=Diversité|volume=138|pages=23–30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140207205942/http://www2.cndp.fr/archivage/valid/66975/66975-10067-12590.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postmodern criticism ===
[[File:I love my 2 gay dad's.jpg|thumb|The Oedipus Complex has been criticized for disregarding nontraditional family structures such as those families with parents of the same sex like the one depicted.]]
In recent years the more countries have come in support of same-sex marriage, with the number expected to increase. As of December 2017, the countries that have legalized gay marriage stands at 29, including the majority of European nations and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-11-15/where-same-sex-marriage-has-been-legalized-around-the-world|title=Same-Sex Marriage Legalization by Country|last=Trimble|first=Megan|date=December 7, 2017|work=US News|accessdate=May 6, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507222617/https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-11-15/where-same-sex-marriage-has-been-legalized-around-the-world|archivedate=2018-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific and technological advancements have allowed gay couples to start families through adoption or surrogacy. As a result the pillars of the family structure are diversifying to include parents who are single or of the same sex as their partner along with the traditional heterosexual, married parents. These new family structures pose new questions for the psychoanalytic theories such as the Oedipus complex that require the presence of the mother and the father in the successful development of a child.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shenkman|first=Geva|date=March 23, 2015|title=Classic psychoanalysis and male same-sex parents: A reexamination of basic concepts.|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=0dc93297-44fd-49b9-9596-74abc6f9a4ba%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=2015-12209-001&amp;db=psyh|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|volume=33|pages=585–598|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However as evidence suggest, children who have been raised by parents of the same sex have shown no difference when compared to children raised in a traditional family structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The classic theory of the oedipal drama has fallen out of favor in today’s society, according to a study by Drescher, having been criticized for its “negative implications” towards same sex parents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is necessary for the psychoanalytic theory to change to keep up with the times and remain relevant. Many psychoanalytic thinkers such as Chodorow and Corbett are working towards changing the Oedipus complex  to eliminate “automatic associations among sex, gender, and the stereotypical psychological functions deriving from these categories” and make it applicable to today’s modern society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From its Freudian conception, psychoanalysis and its theories have always relied on traditional gender roles to draw itself out. In the 1950s psychologists distinguished different roles in parenting for the mother and father. The role of primary caregiver is assigned to the mother. Motherly love was considered to be unconditional. While the father is assigned the role of secondary caregiver, fatherly love is conditional, responsive to the child’s tangible achievements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recent studies suggest, however, that the notions of male and female gender parenting roles and attributes are a result of culture and continuous practice in psychoanalysis with no biological basis. The Oedipus complex is compromised in the context of modern family structures, as it requires the existence of the notions of masculinity and femininity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=David|date=Winter 1999|title=Is a gay Oedipus a Trojan horse?

".&lt;ref&gt;Didier Eribon, "Échapper à la psychanalyse", [[Éditions Léo Scheer]], 2005, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Eribon considers the Oedipus complex of Freudian or Lacanian psychoanalysis is an "implausible ideological construct" which is an "inferiorization process of homosexuality".&lt;ref name="Didier Eribon 1999"&gt;Didier Eribon, Réflexions sur la question gay, Paris, Fayard, 1999. ({{ISBN|2213600988}}), p.129&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologist Geva Shenkman, “To examine the application of concepts such as Oedipus complex and primal scene to male same-sex families, we must first eliminate the automatic associations among sex, gender, and the stereotypical psychological functions based on these categories.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Postmodern psychoanalytic theories are not meant to rid or discredit the foundation of psychoanalysis, but rather aim to reestablish psychoanalysis for modern times. In the case of newer family structures that refute the traditional Oedipus complex, it may mean modifying or discarding the complex completely. Shenkman suggests that a loose interpretation of the Oedipus complex  in which the child seeks sexual satisfaction from any parent regardless of gender or sex, would be helpful: “From this perspective, any parental authority, or institution for that matter, may represent the taboo that gives rise to the complex”. Psychoanalyst Melanie Kline, proposed a theory which broke gender stereotypes, but still kept traditional father-mother family structure. Melanie Kline assigned “dangerous destructive tendencies not just to the father but also to the mother in her discussion of the child’s projective fantasies”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Moreover, from the [[post-modern]] perspective, Grose contends that "the Oedipus complex isn't really like that. It's more a way of explaining how human beings are [[Socialization|socialised]] ... learning to deal with [[Suffering|disappointment]]".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1232"&gt;Anouchka Grose ''No More Silly Love Songs'' (London, 2010) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; The elementary understanding being that "You have to stop trying to be everything for your primary carer, and get on with being something for the rest of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Anouchka Grose ''No More Silly Love Songs'' (London, 2010) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the open question remains whether or not such a post-[[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] interpretation "stretches the Oedipus complex to a point where it almost doesn't look like Freud's any more".&lt;ref name="Didier Eribon 1999"/&gt;

=== Sociocultural criticism ===
Parent-child and sibling-sibling incestuous unions are almost universally forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;The Tapestry of Culture An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology, Ninth Edition, Abraham Rosman, Paula G. Rubel, Maxine Weisgrau, 2009, AltaMira Press, page 101&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation for this [[incest taboo]] is that rather than instinctual sexual desire, there is instinctual sexual aversion against these unions (See [[Westermarck effect]]). [[Steven Pinker]] wrote that "The idea that boys want to sleep with their mothers strikes most men as the silliest thing they have ever heard. Obviously, it did not seem so to Freud, who wrote that as a boy he once had an erotic reaction to watching his mother dressing. Of note is that [[Amalia Freud|Amalia Nathansohn Freud]] was relatively young during Freud's childhood and thus of reproductive age, and Freud having a [[wet-nurse]], may not have experienced the early intimacy that would have tipped off his perceptual system that Mrs. Freud was his mother."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36379708|title=How the mind works|last=1954-|first=Pinker, Steven|date=1997|publisher=Norton|isbn=9780393045352|location=New York|oclc=36379708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary [[psychoanalyst]]s agree with the idea of the Oedipus complex to varying degrees; [[Hans Keller]] proposed it is so "at least in Western societies";&lt;ref&gt;Hans Keller: ''1975: 1984 Minus 9'' (London, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and others consider that [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] already have established its temporal and geographic universality.&lt;ref&gt;Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel and Bela Grunberger ''Freud or Reich?: Psychoanalysis and Illusion'' (London, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, few psychoanalysts disagree that the "child then entered an Oedipal phase ... [which] involved an acute awareness of a complicated [[Phallic stage|triangle]] involving mother, father, and child" and that "both positive and negative Oedipal themes are typically observable in [[Psychosexual development|development]]".&lt;ref&gt;Glen O. Gabbard ''Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy'' (London 2010) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Despite evidence of [[Parent–offspring conflict|parent–child conflict]], the evolutionary psychologists [[Martin Daly]] and [[Margo Wilson]] note that it is not for sexual possession of the opposite sex-parent; thus, in ''Homicide'' (1988), they proposed that the Oedipus complex yields few testable predictions, because they found no evidence of the Oedipus complex in people.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Daly, Margo Wilson ''Homicide'' (New York: Aldine de Gruyter, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''No More Silly Love Songs: A Realist's Guide to Romance'' (2010), [[Anouchka Grose]] says that "a large number of people, these days believe that [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s Oedipus complex is defunct ... 'disproven', or simply found unnecessary, sometime in the last century".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1232"/&gt;

In ''Esquisse pour une autoanalyse'', [[Pierre Bourdieu]] argues that the success of the concept of Oedipus is inseparable from the prestige associated with ancient Greek culture and the relations of domination that are reinforced in the use of this myth. In other words, if Oedipus was Bantu or Baoule, he probably would not have benefited from the coronation of universality. This remark recalls the historically and socially situated character of the founder of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bourdieu, "Esquisse pour une auto-analyse", raisons d'agir, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence ==
A study conducted at Glasgow University potentially supports at least some aspects of the psychoanalytic conception of the Oedipus complex. The study demonstrated that men and women were twice as likely to choose a partner with the same eye color as the parent of the sex they are attracted to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/dating-romantic-partners-parents-look-like-study-relationships-attraction-a8022521.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227183215/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/dating-romantic-partners-parents-look-like-study-relationships-attraction-a8022521.html |archivedate=2017-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study by anthropologist Allen W. Johnson and psychiatrist Douglas Price-Williams suggests that the classic version of the Oedipus Complex that boys go through is present, with the sexual and aggressive sentiments less repressed in cultures without class separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Basic Freud: Psychoanalytic Thought for the 21st Century|last=Khan|first=Michael|publisher=Basic Books|year=2002|isbn=0-465-03715-1|location=New York, NY|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pattern-of-life analysis''' is a method of [[surveillance]] specifically used for documenting or understanding a subject's (or many subjects') habits. This information can then potentially be used to predict future actions by the subject(s) being observed. This form of observation can, and is, generally done without the consent of the subject, with motives including but not limited to [[Signals intelligence|security]], [[normal profit|profit]], scientific research, regular censuses, and [[traffic analysis]]. Unlike these specific areas of surveillance, pattern-of-life analysis is not limited to one medium and can encompass anything in an individual's (or system of individuals') life from their internet browsing habits, to a record of instances of choices made in order to determine a statistical 'favorite'.

== Notable examples ==

=== Wide-Area Motion Imagery ===

[[Wide-Area Motion Imagery (WAMI)|Wide-area motion imagery (WAMI)]] generates high-resolution images to enable tracking and recording of vehicle and pedestrian movements over city-sized areas. Pattern of life (POL) or behavior pattern describes a recurrent (e.g., normalcy) way of acting by an individual or group toward a given object or in a given situation. Usually, one has a specific POL, and this POL is repeatable. Using full motion video or WAMI data with extracted tracks can be used for POL analysis.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pattern of Life from WAMI Objects Tracking based on Context-Aware Tracking and Information Network Models|url=http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1691331|accessdate=23 May 2013|last1= Gao|first1= J.|last2= Ling|first2= Haibin|last3= Blasch|first3= Erik|last4= Pham|first4= Khanh|last5= Wang|first5= Zhonghai|last6= Chen|first6= Genshe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Context-aware tracking with wide-area motion imagery

=== Esri's use of ArcGIS ===
Esri is an international supplier of [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS) software, web GIS and [[geodatabase]] management applications. Esri uses the name [[ArcGIS]] to refer to its suite of GIS software products, which operate on desktop, server, and mobile platforms. The term GIS describes any [[information]] system that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes, shares and displays geographic information for informing [[decision making]]. With this technology, the company's goal is to unify information of a subject's life habits and their geographical whereabouts with statistics related to [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] casualties in an effort to predict and prevent another IED incident from happening. In one presentation used at an Esri Federal User Conference, it states: "Exploitation of a cell's network enables a commander with the right tools to get 'Left of Boom' [i.e. before an IED or bomb detonates]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using ArcGIS for Intelligence Analysis|url=http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/feduc11/papers/tech/feduc-using-arcgis-for-intelligence-analysis.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2014|last1= Mason|first1= Tony|last2= Foss|first2= Suzanne|last3= Lam|first3= Vinh|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MARINA ===
MARINA is an NSA database and analysis toolset for intercepted Internet metadata (DNI in NSA terminology). The database stores metadata up to a year. According to documents leaked by Edward Snowden: "The Marina metadata application tracks a user's browser experience, gathers contact information/content and develops summaries of target" and "[o]f the more distinguishing features, Marina has the ability to look back on the last 365 days' worth of DNI metadata seen by the Sigint collection system, regardless whether or not it was tasked for collection." [Emphasis in original NSA document.] The stored metadata is mainly used for pattern-of-life analysis. US persons are not exempt because metadata is not considered data by US law (section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act). {{fact|date=July 2017}}

MARINA's phone counterpart is MAINWAY.

A '''play clock''', also called a '''delay-of-game timer''',&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.electro-mech.com/Manuals/3050.pdf Electro-Mech], [http://www.eversan.com/specs/9330.pdf Eversan], [http://www.nevco.com/prod/PRODSPEC/1122993270_DGT-5%20Product%20Spec.pdf Nevco], and other manufacturers call these devices "delay of game timers" in their literature.&lt;/ref&gt; is a countdown clock intended to speed up the pace of the game, and hopefully the scoring, in [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]]. The [[offensive team]] must put the ball in play by either [[Snap (football)|snapping]] the ball during a scrimmage down or kicking the ball during a free kick down before the time expires, or else they will be assessed a 5-yard ''delay of game'' (American football) or ''time count'' (Canadian football; that code's "delay of game" is a different infraction) penalty. If a visible clock is not available or not functioning, game officials on the field will use a stopwatch or other similar device to enforce the rule.

In all levels of Canadian football, the offensive team must run a play within 20 seconds of the referee whistling the play in; in amateur American football, teams have 25 seconds from the time the ball is declared ready for play.  In the [[NFL]], teams have 40 seconds timed from the end of the previous down. Before 2008, in college football, the play clock was 25 seconds after the ball was set, but the clock was not stopped for the ball to be set unless the previous play resulted in a stoppage of the clock. Now, the same intervals as the NFL are used, with minor differences for the final two minutes of each half.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/PressArchive/2008/Playing%2BRules/NCAA%2BFootball%2BRules%2BCommittee%2BProposes%2BRules%2Bto%2BEnhance%2BStudent-Athlete%2BSafety%2Band%2BEncourage%2BConsistent%2BPace%2Bof%2BPlay.html "NCAA Football Rules Committee Proposes Rules to Enhance Student-Athlete Safety and Encourage Consistent Pace of Play"]&lt;/ref&gt; Various professional leagues have used their own standards; the [[XFL]], for instance, used a 35-second play clock to encourage faster play. [[Arena football]] uses a 32-second play clock.

Also in the [[Canadian Football League]], a ''time count'' is enforced differently at certain points of the game. If the time count occurs before the [[Three-minute warning (football)|three-minute mark of a half]], the penalty is five yards and the down is repeated. In the final three minutes, the penalty is a loss of down on first and second down or 10 yards, with the down repeated, on third down. If the referee deems a time count committed on third down in the last three minutes of a half to be deliberate, he also has the right to require the offensive team to put the ball in play legally within 20 seconds or else forfeit possession. (Time counts during convert attempts, during which the ball is live but the clock does not run, are 5-yard penalties with the down repeated at all times in the game.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cfl.ca/uploads/assets/CFL/PDF_Docs/CFLRules_2010_ENG.pdf |title=Rule 1, Section 7, Article 9 – Time Count |work=2010 Canadian Football League Rule Book |format=PDF |page=17 |publisher=Canadian Football League |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213074937/http://cfl.ca/uploads/assets/CFL/PDF_Docs/CFLRules_2010_ENG.pdf |archivedate=December 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the strategy of [[clock management]], a team can slow the pace of a game by taking the maximum amount of time allotted between plays. A team wishing to do so would wait to snap the ball until there is one second left on the play clock.

In many football games, the play clock is managed by the [[back judge]] who is positioned behind the defense and faces the quarterback.  When the play clock counts down to 5 seconds remaining, some back judges will raise their arm over their head to warn the quarterback, and rotate their arm downward to their leg, counting down the final seconds.  A penalty flag for delay is thrown afterward.  The infraction typically results in a five-yard penalty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32316">{{Sociolinguistics}}
'''Prestige''' is the level of regard normally accorded a specific [[language]] or [[dialect]] within a [[speech community]], relative to other languages or dialects. The concept of prestige in [[sociolinguistics]] provides one explanation for the phenomenon of variation in form, among speakers of a language or languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eckert|Rickford|2002|pp=2–4, 24, 260–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prestige varieties are those varieties which are generally considered, by a society, to be the most correct or otherwise superior variety. The prestige variety, in many cases, is the [[standard language|standard form of the language]] though there are exceptions, particularly in situations of covert prestige where a non-standard dialect is highly valued.

Sociolinguistic prestige is especially visible in situations where two or more distinct languages are in use, and in [[Multiculturalism|diverse]], socially stratified [[urban area]]s, in which there are likely to be speakers of different languages and/or dialects interacting frequently.

The prevailing view among contemporary linguists is that regardless of perceptions that a dialect or language is "better" or "worse" than its counterparts, when dialects and languages are assessed "on purely [[linguistics|linguistic]] grounds, all languages—and all dialects—have equal merit".&lt;ref name="on_language"&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Grady et al.|2001|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fasold|Connor-Linton|2006|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard varieties and covert prestige==
{{main|Standard language}}
Prestige varieties are those that are regarded mostly highly within a society. As such, the standard language, the form promoted by authorities and considered correct or otherwise superior, is often the prestige variety. However, there are many exceptions to this rule, such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], in which [[Egyptian Arabic]] is widely used in [[mass media]] aimed at international audiences, while [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] (also known as Standard Arabic) is a more prestigious form.&lt;ref name="Ibrahim 1986, p. 115"&gt;{{harvnb|Ibrahim|1986|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|2001|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haeri|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prestige varieties do not exhibit features, grammatically speaking, which prove them superior in terms of logic, efficacy or aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Preston|1996|pp=40–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the language varieties of the prestigious social classes.&lt;ref name="Labov" /&gt; Therefore, the prestige variety of a given language community or nation-state has symbolic significance and may act as an instrument of political power.

The notion of a "standard" language in a speech community is related to the prestige of the languages spoken in the community. In general, "greater prestige tends to be attached to the notion of the standard, since it can function in higher domains, and has a written form."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leith|1997|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are some counterexamples, such as Arabic, "prestigious and standard varieties [tend to] coincide to the extent that the two terms can be used interchangeably."&lt;ref name="Ibrahim 1986, p. 115"/&gt;

In countries like the [[United States]], where [[citizen]]s speak many different languages and come from a variety of [[nationality|national]] and [[ethnic group]]s, there is a "[[folk linguistics|folk linguistic]]" belief that the most prestigious dialect is the single standard dialect of [[English language|English]] that all people should speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niedzielski|Preston|2003|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguist]] [[Rosina Lippi-Green]] believes that this belief in a standard language justifies and rationalizes the preservation of the [[social order]], since it equates "nonstandard" or "substandard" language with "nonstandard or substandard human beings."&lt;ref name="on_language" /&gt; Linguists believe that no language, or variety of language, is inherently better than any other language, for every language serves its purpose of allowing its users to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wardhaugh|2006|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms and conditions of prestige assigned to a language variety are subject to change depending on speaker, situation and context. A [[dialect]] or variety which is considered prestigious in one context, will not carry the same status in another.&lt;ref name="Trudgill" /&gt; The relative status of language varieties according to audience, situation and other contextual elements is highly local. [[Covert prestige]] refers to relatively high value placed on a non-standard form of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Labov|2006|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Different languages and dialects are accorded prestige based upon factors which include "rich literary heritage, high degree of language modernization, considerable international standing, or the prestige of its speakers".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kloss|1966|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having many of these attributes will likely mean the language is viewed as being of high prestige; likewise, a language or dialect with few or none of these attributes will be considered to be of low prestige. The phenomenon is not limited to English-speaking populations. In [[Western Europe]], multiple languages were considered to be of high prestige at some time or another, including "[[Italian language|Italian]] as the [[Mediterranean]] ''[[lingua franca]]'' and as the language of the [[Renaissance]]; and the 17th-18th century [[French language|French]] of the [[noble court|court culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahane|1986|p=495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a strong correlation between the prestige of a group of people and the prestige accorded to the language they speak, as "language is intertwined with culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahane|1986|p=498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Laurie Bauer's description of [[Latin]]'s prestige exemplifies this phenomenon: {{cquote|The prestige accorded to the churchmen, lawyers and scholars who used Latin was transferred to the language itself. Latin was held to be noble and beautiful, not just the thoughts expressed in it or the people who used it. What is called 'beauty' in a language is more accurately seen as a reflection of the prestige of its speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bauer|1998|pp=132–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Walt Wolfram, a professor of linguistics at [[North Carolina State University]], notes that he "can't think of any situations in the United States where low-prestige groups have high-prestige language systems".&lt;ref name="on_language"/&gt;

==Language attitudes==
{{Further|Dialect}}
Prestige influences whether a [[variety (linguistics)|language variety]] is considered a [[language]] or a dialect. In discussing definitions of language, [[Dell Hymes]] wrote that "sometimes two communities are said to have the same, or different, languages on the grounds of [[mutual intelligibility]], or lack thereof", but alone, this definition is often insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hymes|1971|pp=47–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different language varieties in an area exist along a [[dialect continuum]], and moving [[geography|geographically]] often means a change in the local variety.

This continuum means that despite the fact that [[standard German]] and [[standard Dutch]] are not mutually intelligible, the speech of people living near the [[border]] between [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] will more closely resemble that of their neighbors across the border than the [[standard language]]s of their respective home countries. Even so, speakers near the border would describe themselves as speaking a variety of their respective standard languages, and the evolution of these dialects tends to mirror that of the standard languages as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trudgill|1992|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wardhaugh|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That they are classified as such reflects the fact that "language differences are not only marks of differential group membership, but also powerful triggers of group attitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haugen|1966b|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such fuzziness has resulted in the [[aphorism]] "[[A language is a dialect with an army and a navy]]." That is, speakers of some language variety with political and social power are viewed as having a distinct language, while "'dialect' is [...] a term that suggests lower-class or rural speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haugen|1966a|p=924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[wikt:canonical|canonical]] example of this is the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]], including [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], where language differences "constitute barriers to but do not wholly block communication", but are considered distinct languages because they are spoken in different [[country|countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haugen|1966b|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social class===
While some differences between dialects are [[region]]al in nature, there are also [[social]] causes for differences in dialects. Very often, the "public prestige dialect of the elite in a stratified community differs from the dialect(s) of the non-elite strata ([[working class]] and other)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kroch|1978|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in an article which in part tried to motivate the study of [[sociolinguistics]], [[Raven McDavid]] wrote that "the importance of language as a mirror of culture can be demonstrated by dialect differences in American English".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDavid|1946||p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the relation between the way speakers use a language and their social status is a long recognized tool in sociolinguistics.

In 1958, one of the earliest studies of the relationship between social differences and dialect differences was published by [[John Gumperz]], who studied the speech patterns in [[Khalapur]], a small, highly stratified [[village]] in [[India]]. In all, the village has 31 [[caste]]s, ranging from [[Brahmin]]s and [[Rajput]]s at the top, to [[Chamar]]s and [[Bhangi]]s at the bottom, and 90% of the overall population was [[Hindu]], with the remaining 10% [[Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gumperz|1958|p=670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gumperz observed that the different castes were distinguished both [[phonology|phonologically]] and [[word|lexically]], with each caste having a [[vocabulary]] specific to their [[subculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gumperz|1958|p=675}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkably, the speech differences between Hindus and Muslims "are of the same order as those between individual touchable castes and certainly much less important than the variation between touchables and untouchables".&lt;ref name="Gumperz"&gt;{{harvnb|Gumperz|1958|p=676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gumperz also observed that the lower prestige groups sought to imitate the higher prestige speech patterns and that over time, it had caused the [[sociocultural evolution|evolution]] of the prestige away from the regional standard, as higher prestige groups sought to differentiate themselves from lower prestige groups.&lt;ref name="Gumperz" /&gt; He concluded that in determining speech patterns in this [[community]], "the determining factor seems to be informal friendship contacts" rather than work contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gumperz|1958|p=681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable example of the relationship between dialect and social stratification in English is [[William Labov]]'s 1966 study of the [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|variable pronunciation of ''r'']] in [[New York City]]. Labov went to three New York City [[department store]]s that catered to three clearly delineated [[socioeconomic]] groups—[[Saks Fifth Avenue|Saks]] (high), [[Macy's]] (middle), and [[S. Klein]] (low)—and studied how their employees pronounced the phrase "fourth floor". His results demonstrated that the employees at Saks pronounced ''r'' most often, Macy's employees pronounced ''r'' less often, and at S. Klein, seventy-nine percent of the respondents said no ''r'' at all. Another trend Labov noticed was that at all three of the stores, but Macy's in particular, when prompted to say "fourth floor" a second time, employees were much more likely to pronounce the ''r''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wardhaugh|2006|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labov attributed his findings to the perceived prestige of each dialect. He noted that New York City's "dropped 'r' has its origins in posh British speech", but after [[World War II]], "with the loss of Britain's imperial status 'r'-less British speech ceased to be regarded as 'prestige speech'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seabrook|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, when Labov performed his study, pronouncing words like ''car'' and ''guard'' with ''r'' was then considered an element of prestige speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wardhaugh|2006|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in [[middle-class]] employees, once made conscious of having to pronounce "fourth floor", altering their pronunciation in order to match that of the high prestige dialect. The prestige given to ''r'' was also evident in the [[hypercorrection]] observed in lower-class speech. Knowing that ''r''-pronunciation was a prestigious trait, many of the lower-class speakers in another Labov study—in which speakers were asked to read from word lists—added ''-r'' to words that did not have an ''r'' at all. The difference between this study and the "fourth floor" study was the fact that speakers were closely monitoring their speech, not speaking spontaneously, and were thus careful to add ''r'' in an attempt to mimic a higher social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wardhaugh|2006|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and covert prestige===
{{Further|Language and gender}}
Non-standard dialects are usually considered low-prestige, but in some situations dialects "stigmatized by the education system still enjoy a ''covert'' prestige among working-class men for the very reason that they are considered incorrect".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leith|1997|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; These situations occur when the speaker wants to gain recognition, acceptance, or [[Social solidarity|solidarity]] with a specific—and non-prestigious—group of people, or to signal to other speakers their identification with that group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|1998|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of covert prestige was first introduced by William Labov, who noticed that even speakers who used non-standard dialects often believed that their own dialect was "bad" or "inferior". Labov realized that there must be some underlying reason for their use of the dialect, which he identified as a signal of group identity.&lt;ref name="Labov"&gt;{{harvnb|Labov|2006|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is a 1998 study on the use of word-final ''-ing'' versus ''-in'' among college [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] men in the United States. The fraternity men used "-in" rather than "-ing," from which the author concluded that the men used ''-in'' to demonstrate what they saw as working-class behavioral traits, such as 'hard-working' and 'casual,' thus creating a specific identity for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kiesling|1998|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, in studies of the speech patterns in [[British English]], [[Peter Trudgill]] observed that more working class women spoke the standard dialect than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trudgill|1972|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farida Abu-Haidar performed a similar study in [[Baghdad]] of prestige in the Arabic language, after which she concluded that in Baghdadi Arabic, women are more conscious of prestige than are men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abu-Haidar|1989|p=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas in which this has been observed include [[New Zealand]] and [[Guangdong]] in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gordon|1997|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2008|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; As explanation, Trudgill suggests that for men, there is covert prestige associated with speaking the working class dialect.&lt;ref name="Trudgill"&gt;{{harvnb|Trudgill|1972|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he observed men claiming to speak a ''less'' prestigious dialect than that which they actually spoke. According to this interpretation then, "women's use of prestige features simply conforms to the ordinary sociolinguistic order, while men deviate from what is expected."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fasold|1990|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Gordon, in her study of New Zealand, suggested instead that women used higher prestige forms because of the association of [[human female sexuality|sexual]] [[immorality]] with lower-class [[woman|women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gordon|1997|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the cause, women across many cultures seem more likely than men to modify their speech towards the prestige dialect.

Though women use prestige dialects more frequently than do men, the same gender preference for prestige languages does not seem to exist. A study of [[diglossia|diglossic]] societies by John Angle and Sharlene Hesse-Biber showed that the men were more likely to speak the prestige language than were women.&lt;ref name="angle"&gt;{{harvnb|Angle|Hesse-Biber|1981|p=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation put forth for this is that men are more likely to have the means of acquiring a second language than are women.

==Language contact==
When different languages or language varieties come in contact with one another, a variety of relationships can form between the two, all typically influenced by prestige. When the two contact languages have equal power or prestige, they form [[Stratum (linguistics)#Adstratum|adstratum]], as exemplified by [[Old English]] and [[Old Norse|Norse]], which shared elements with each other more or less equally.

Far more common is for the two languages to have an unequal power relationship, as is the case of many colonial language contact situations. Languages that have a higher status in relation to a certain group often manifest themselves in [[loanword|word borrowing]]. One example is in English, which features a large number of words borrowed from French, as a result of the historical prestige of French. Another potential result of such contact relationships includes the creation of a [[pidgin]] or eventually [[creole language|creole]] through [[nativization]]. In the case of pidgins and creoles, it is usually noted that the low prestige language provides the phonology while the high prestige language provides the [[lexicon]] and [[grammar|grammatical structure]].

In addition to forming of a new language, known as a creole, [[language contact]] can result in changes to the languages in contact, such as [[language convergence]], [[language shift]] or [[language death]]. Language convergence is when two languages have been exposed for a long period of time and they begin to have more properties in common. Language shift is when a speaker shifts from speaking a lower prestige dialect to a higher prestige dialect. Language death is when speakers of a language die off, and there are no new generations learning to speak this language. The intensity of the contact between the two languages and their relative prestige levels influence the degree to which a language experiences lexical borrowing and changes to the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], phonology, [[syntax]], and overall structure of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winford|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language structure==
{{Further|Diglossia}}
When two languages with an asymmetrical power relationship come into contact, such as through [[colony|colonization]] or in a [[refugee]] situation, the creole that results is typically largely based on the prestige language; as noted above, linguists have observed that the low-prestige language usually provides the phonology while the high-prestige language provides the lexicon and grammatical structure. Over time, continued contact between the creole and the prestige language may result in [[decreolization]], in which the creole begins to more closely resemble the prestige language. Decreolization thus creates a [[post-creole continuum|creole continuum]], ranging from an [[acrolect]] (a version of the creole that is very similar to the prestige language), to [[mesolect]]s (decreasingly similar versions), to the [[basilect]] (the most “conservative" creole). An example of decreolization described by Hock and Joseph is [[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE), in which older, more conservative versions preserve [[feature (linguistics)|features]] such as the [[perfective aspect|completive marker]] ''done'' while newer, less conservative versions do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hock|Joseph|1996|p=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some instances of contact between languages with different prestige levels have resulted in [[diglossia]], a phenomenon in which a community uses a high prestige language or dialect in certain situations, usually for [[newspaper]]s, in [[literature]], on [[campus|university campuses]], for religious ceremonies, and on [[television]] and the [[radio]], but uses a low prestige language or dialect for other situations, often in conversation in the home or in [[letter (message)|letter]]s, [[comic strip]]s, and in [[popular culture]]. Linguist [[Charles A. Ferguson]]'s 1959 article "Diglossia" listed the following examples of diglossic societies: in the Middle East and North Africa, [[Standard Arabic]] and [[vernacular Arabic]]s; in Greece, [[Katharevousa]] and [[Dhimotiki]]; in Switzerland, [[Swiss Standard German]] and [[Swiss German]]; and in Haiti, [[Standard French]] and [[Haitian Creole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most African countries, a European language serves as the official, prestige language ([[Standard French]], [[English language|English]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), while local languages ([[Wolof language|Wolof]], [[Bambara language|Bambara]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]) or creoles ([[Ivorian French]], [[Nigerian English]]) serve as everyday languages of communication.

In diglossic societies, the prestigious language tends to be very conservative and resist change over time while the low-prestige language, the local vernacular, undergoes normal language change. For instance, Latin, the high prestige language of [[Europe]] for many centuries, underwent minimal change while the everyday low prestige languages which were spoken evolved significantly. If, however, the two languages are spoken freely, the prestige language may undergo [[vernacular]]ization and begin to incorporate vernacular features. An example is [[Sanskrit]], an ancient prestige language that has incorporated the vernacular pronunciations of {{IPAblink|tʃ}} and {{IPA|[b]}} for word-initial ''y-'' and ''v-''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hock|1996|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prestige language may also change under the influence of specific regional dialects in a process known as [[regionalisation|regionalization]]. For example, in medieval times, [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] developed different forms in various countries where it was used, including [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], as well as other Roman Catholic nations, notably in pronunciation – see [[Latin regional pronunciation]]. Some of these differences were minor, such as ''c'' before ''i'' and ''e'' being pronounced {{IPA|[tʃ]}} in Italy but {{IPA|[s]}} in France, but after English underwent the [[Great Vowel Shift]] between 1200 and 1600, the vowel system in England became nearly unrecognisable to its European ecclesiastic counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hock|1996|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Quantum efficiency graph for WFPC2-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|A graph showing variation of quantum efficiency with wavelength of a CCD chip in the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 3]].]]
The term '''quantum efficiency''' ('''QE''') may apply to '''incident photon to converted electron (IPCE) ratio''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen|first=Sean|title=2.5% efficient organic plastic solar cells|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=2001|volume=78|issue=6|doi=10.1063/1.1345834|url=http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v78/i6/p841_s1?bypassSSO=1|accessdate=20 May 2012|bibcode = 2001ApPhL..78..841S }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[photosensitivity|photosensitive device]] or it may refer to the [[Tunnel magnetoresistance|TMR effect]] of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction.

This article deals with the term as a measurement of a device's electrical sensitivity to light. In a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) it is the percentage of [[photon]]s hitting the device's photoreactive surface that produce [[charge carrier]]s. It is measured in [[electron]]s per photon or [[ampere|amps]] per [[watt]]. Since the energy of a photon is [[proportionality (mathematics)#Inversely proportional|inversely proportional]] to its [[wavelength]], QE is often measured over a range of different wavelengths to characterize a device's [[efficiency]] at each photon energy level. The QE for photons with energy below the [[band gap]] is zero. Photographic film typically has a QE of much less than 10%,&lt;ref name=Trager200&gt;{{cite book|last=Träger|first=Frank|title=Handbook of Lasers and Optics|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642194092|pages=601, 603|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ad5G1HWtDRgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA603#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; while CCDs can have a QE of well over 90% at some wavelengths.

==Of solar cells==
[[Image:Solarcellige-en.svg|thumb|right|400px|A graph showing variation of internal quantum efficiency, external quantum efficiency, and reflectance with wavelength of a crystalline silicon solar cell.]]

A [[Quantum efficiency of a solar cell|solar cell's quantum efficiency]] value indicates the amount of current that the cell will produce when irradiated by photons of a particular wavelength. If the cell's quantum efficiency is [[integral|integrated]] over the whole [[sunlight|solar electromagnetic spectrum]], one can evaluate the amount of current that the cell will produce when exposed to sunlight. The ratio between this energy-production value and the highest possible energy-production value for the cell (i.e., if the QE were 100% over the whole spectrum) gives the cell's overall [[solar cell efficiency|energy conversion efficiency]] value. Note that in the event of [[multiple exciton generation]] (MEG), quantum efficiencies of greater than 100% may be achieved since the incident photons have more than twice the [[band gap]] energy and can create two or more electron-hole pairs per incident photon.

===Types===
Two types of quantum efficiency of a solar cell are often considered:

*'''External Quantum Efficiency (EQE)''' is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy ''shining on the solar cell from outside'' (incident photons).
*'''Internal Quantum Efficiency (IQE)''' is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy that shine on the solar cell from outside ''and'' are absorbed by the cell.

The IQE is always larger than the EQE. A low IQE indicates that the active layer of the solar cell is unable to make good use of the photons. To measure the IQE, one first measures the EQE of the solar device, then measures its transmission and reflection, and combines these data to infer the IQE.

:&lt;math&gt; \text{EQE} = \frac{\text{electrons/sec}}{\text{photons/sec}}= \frac{\text{(current)}/\text{(charge of one electron)}}{(\text{total power of photons})/(\text{energy of one photon})}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{IQE} = 
\frac{\text{electrons/sec}}{\text{absorbed photons/sec}}= 
\frac{\text{EQE}}{\text{1-Reflection}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The external quantum efficiency therefore depends on both the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of light and the collection of charges. Once a photon has been absorbed and has generated an electron-hole pair, these charges must be separated and collected at the junction. A "good" material avoids charge recombination. Charge recombination causes a drop in the external quantum efficiency.

The ideal quantum efficiency graph has a [[Boxcar function|square shape]], where the QE value is fairly constant across the entire spectrum of wavelengths measured. However, the QE for most solar cells is reduced because of the effects of recombination, where charge carriers are not able to move into an external circuit. The same mechanisms that affect the collection probability also affect the QE. For example, modifying the front surface can affect carriers generated near the surface. And because high-energy (blue) light is absorbed very close to the surface, considerable recombination at the front surface will affect the "blue" portion of the QE. Similarly, lower energy (green) light is absorbed in the bulk of a solar cell, and a low diffusion length will affect the collection probability from the solar cell bulk, reducing the QE in the green portion of the spectrum. Generally, solar cells on the market today do not produce much electricity from [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]] light (&lt;400&amp;nbsp;nm and &gt;1100&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths, respectively); these wavelengths of light are either filtered out or are absorbed by the cell, thus heating the cell. That heat is wasted energy, and could damage the cell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/08/21/silicon-nanoparticle-film-can-increase-solar-cell-performance/ Silicon nanoparticle film can increase solar cell performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quantum efficiency of Image Sensors''' :
Quantum efficiency (QE) is the fraction of photon flux that contributes to the photocurrent in a photodetector or
a pixel. Quantum efficiency is one of the most important parameters used to evaluate the quality of a detector and is often called the spectral response to reflect its wavelength dependence. It is defined as the number of signal electrons created per incident photon. In some cases it can exceed 100% (i.e. when more than one electron is created per incident photon).

'''EQE mapping''' :
Conventional measurement of the EQE will give the efficiency of the overall device. However it is often useful to have a map of the EQE over large area of the device. This mapping provides an efficient way to visualize the homogeneity and/or the defects in the sample. It was realized by researchers from the Institute of Researcher and Development on Photovoltaic Energy (IRDEP) who calculated the EQE mapping from electroluminescence measurements taken with an [[hyperspectral]] imager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Delamarre |display-authors=etal  |title=Evaluation of micrometer scale lateral fluctuations of transport properties in CIGS solar cells |journal=Proc. SPIE  |volume=100 |date=2013 | doi=10.1117/12.2004323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Delamarre |display-authors=etal |title=Quantitative luminescence mapping of Cu(In,Ga)Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin-film solar cells |journal=Progress in Photovoltaics |date=2014 | doi=10.1002/pip.2555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectral responsivity==
[[responsivity|Spectral responsivity]] is a similar measurement, but it has different units: [[ampere]]s per [[watt]] (A/W); (i.e. how much [[electric current|current]] comes out of the device per incoming photon of a given energy and wavelength). Both the quantum efficiency and the responsivity are functions of the photons' wavelength (indicated by the subscript λ).

To convert from responsivity (''R&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'', in A/W) to QE&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Rogalski, K. Adamiec and J. Rutkowski, ''Narrow-Gap Semiconductor Photodiodes'', SPIE Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; (on a scale 0 to 1):

:&lt;math&gt;QE_\lambda=\frac{R_\lambda}{\lambda}\times\frac{h c}{e}\approx\frac{R_\lambda}{\lambda} {\times} (1240\;{\rm W}\cdot {\rm nm/A})  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ'' is the wavelength in [[nanometre|nm]], ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, and ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]].

===Determination===
:&lt;math&gt;QE_\lambda=\eta =\frac{N_e}{N_\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_e&lt;/math&gt; = number of electrons produced, &lt;math&gt;N_\nu&lt;/math&gt; = number of photons absorbed.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N_\nu}t = \Phi_o \frac{\lambda}{hc}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming each photon absorbed in the depletion layer produces a viable electron-hole pair, and all other photons do not,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N_e}t = \Phi_{\xi}\frac{\lambda}{hc}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the measurement time (in seconds), 
&lt;math&gt;\Phi_o&lt;/math&gt; = incident optical power in watts, 
&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\xi}&lt;/math&gt; = optical power absorbed in depletion layer, also in watts.

The '''Records Continuum Model''' (RCM) was created in the 1990s by [[Monash University]] academic [[Frank Upward]] with input from colleagues [[Sue McKemmish]] and Livia Iacovino as a response to evolving discussions about the challenges of managing digital records and archives in the discipline of [[Archival science|Archival Science]].&lt;ref name="elis"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKemmish |first1=S. |last2=Upward |first2=F. H. |last3=Reed |first3=B. |year=2010 |chapter=Records Continuum Model |title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences |edition=3rd |pages=4447–8 |url=http://doi.org/10.1081/E-ELIS3-120043719 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RCM was first published in Upward’s 1996 paper "Structuring the Records Continuum – Part One: Postcustodial principles and properties".&lt;ref name="upward1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1996 |title=Structuring the records continuum – part one: postcustodial principles and properties |journal=Archives &amp; Manuscripts |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=268–285 |url=http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/research/groups/rcrg/publications/recordscontinuum-fupp1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upward describes the RCM within the broad context of a [[continuum (measurement)|continuum]] where activities and interactions transform documents into records, evidence and memory that are used for multiple purposes over time. Upward places the RCM within a post-custodial, [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] and [[Structuration theory|structuration]] conceptual framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1997 |title=Structuring the records continuum – part two: structuration theory and recordkeeping |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=10–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian academics and practitioners continue to explore, develop and extend the RCM and records continuum theory, along with international collaborators, via the Records Continuum Research Group (RCRG) at Monash University.

==Description==
The RCM is an abstract conceptual model that helps to understand and explore recordkeeping activities (as interaction) in relation to multiple contexts over space and time ([[spacetime]]).&lt;ref name="McK2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKemmish |first=S. |year=2001 |title=Placing records continuum theory and practice |journal=Archival Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=333–359 |url=http://doi.org/10.1007/BF02438901 }}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recordkeeping activities take place from before the records are created by identifying recordkeeping requirements in policies, systems, organizations, processes, laws, social mandates that impact on what is created and how it is managed over spacetime. In a continuum, recordkeeping processes, such as adding [[metadata]], fix documents so that they can be managed as evidence. Those records deemed as having continuing value are retained and managed as an archive. The implication of an RCM approach to records and archives is that systems and processes can be designed and put in place before records are even created. A continuum approach therefore highlights that records are both current and archival at the point of creation.&lt;ref name="curtin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://john.curtin.edu.au/society/australia/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013123845/http://john.curtin.edu.au/society/australia/ |archivedate=2014-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCM is represented as a series of concentric rings (dimensions of ''Create'', ''Capture'', ''Organize'' and ''Pluralize'') and crossed axes (transactionality, evidentiality, recordkeeping and identity) with each axis labelled with a description of the activity or interaction that occurs at that intersection. ''Create'', ''Capture'', ''Organize'' and ''Pluralize'' represent recordkeeping activities that occur within spacetime. Activities that occur in these dimensions across the axes are explained in the table below:&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The information in the table is drawn from {{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2005 |chapter=The Records Continuum |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Reed |editor4-first=F. |editor4-last=Upward |title=Archives: Recordkeeping in Society |pages=197–222 |place=Wagga Wagga, NSW |publisher=Centre for Information Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the RCM is that it can help to map where on a continuum recordkeeping activities are or can be placed. The RCM can then be used to explore the conceptual and practical assumptions that underpin the practice, in particular the dualisms inherent in the usage and practice of the terms "records" and "archives".&lt;ref name="upward1"/&gt; This definition lends itself to a linear reading of the RCM – starting at ''Create'' as the initiating phase and working outwards towards ''Pluralization'' of recorded information. Another linear reading is to consider design first – the role that systems of ''Pluralization'' and ''Organization'' play in designing, planning and implementing recordkeeping and then considering the implications for ''Create'' and ''Capture''. However, these are just two of many ways to interpret the model as the dimensions and axes represent multiple realities that occur within spacetime, any of which can occur simultaneously, concurrently and sequentially in electronic or digital environments, and/or physical spaces.&lt;ref name="curtin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reed |first=B. |year=2005 |title=Reading the records continuum: interpretations and explorations |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=18–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By representing multiple realities, the RCM articulates the numerous and diverse perspectives that contribute to records and archives including individual, group, community, organizational, institutional and societal. These contexts reveal the need to take into account various stakeholders and co-contributors in relation to use, access and appraisal of records and archives. Over the lifespan of a record multiple decisions are made by various stakeholders of the records that include, but are not limited to records managers and archivists. Other stakeholders can be identified at various dimensions of interaction, including those involved in providing information (not only the person or organization who produced or captured it), as well as their family and community. Records are therefore not simply physical or digital representations of physical objects held and managed in an archive or repository, but are evidence of multiple perspectives, narratives and contexts that contributed to their formation.

The RCM is often described as being in contrast or at odds with the [[Records life-cycle|lifecycle]] records model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/r/records-continuum |title=Records Continuum |work=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |publisher=Society of American Archivists |accessdate=5 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McK1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=McKemmish |first=S. |year=1997 |chapter=Yesterday, today and tomorrow: a continuum of responsibility |title=Proceedings of the Records Management Association of Australia 14th National Convention, 15–17 Sept 1997 |pages=18–36 |place=Perth, Australia |publisher=RMAA }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the RCM is inclusive of multiple ways of conceptualizing and performing recordkeeping, including a lifecycle approach, there are some significant differences. Firstly, where the lifecycle approach shows clearly demarcated phases in the management of records, a continuum approach conceptualizes elements as continuous with no discernable parts.&lt;ref name="McK1997"/&gt; Secondly, the lifecycle approach identifies clear conceptual and procedural boundaries between active or current records and inactive or historical records, but a continuum approach sees records processes as more integrated across spacetime. In the continuum it is recordkeeping processes that carry records forward through spacetime to enable their use for multiple purposes. What this means is that records are always "in a state of always becoming...",&lt;ref name="McK2001"/&gt; and able to contribute new contexts via the recordkeeping processes that occur with them. Archival records are therefore not just historical, but are able to be re-interpreted, re-created, and re-contextualized according to their place and use in spacetime.  In this way, archival institutions are nodes in the network of recorded information and its contexts, rather than the end point in a lifecycle stage for records that are managed as "relics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Acland |first=G. |year=1992 |title=Managing the record rather than the relic |journal=Archives &amp; Manuscripts |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=57–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and influences ==
The RCM is a representation of what is commonly referred to as records continuum theory, as well as Australian continuum thinking and/or approaches.&lt;ref name="McK2001"/&gt; These ideas were evolved as part of an Australian approach to archival management espoused by Ian Maclean, Chief Archivist of the Commonwealth Archives Office in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s. Maclean, whose ideas and practices were the subject of the first RCRG publication in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKemmish |first1=S. |last2=Piggott |first2=M. |year=1994 |title=The Records Continuum: Ian Maclean and Australian Archives: first fifty years |publisher=Ancora Press |place=Clayton |isbn=086862019X }}&lt;/ref&gt; referred in a 1959 ''American Archivist'' article to a "continuum of (public) records administration" from administrative efficiency through recordkeeping to the safe keeping of a "cultural end-product".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maclean |first=I. |title=Australian experience in records and archives management |journal=American Archivist |year=1959 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=383–418 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maclean’s vision challenged the divide between current recordkeeping and archival practice. Fellow contemporary at the Commonwealth Archives Office Peter Scott is also included as a core influence on Australian records continuum theory with his development of the Australian Series System, a registry system that helped identify and document the complex and multiple "social, functional, provenancial, and documentary relationships" involved in managing records and recordkeeping processes over spacetime.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;

Further influences on the RCRG group include archival professionals and researchers like [[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics|David Bearman]] and his work on transactionality and systems thinking, and [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]]'s ideas about postcustodialism and macroappraisal.&lt;ref name="Upw2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2000 |title=Modelling the continuum as paradigm shift in recordkeeping and archiving processes, and beyond – a personal reflection |journal=Records Management Journal |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=115–39 |url=http://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000007259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wider influencing ideas include those from philosophers and social theorists [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Jean-François Lyotard]], as well as sociologist [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]], with structuration theory being a core component of understanding social interaction over spacetime.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt; Canadian archivist Jay Atherton's critique of the division between records managers and archivists in the 1980s and use of the term "records continuum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atherton |first=J. |title=From life cycle to continuum: some thoughts on the records management-archives relationship |journal=Archivaria |date=1985–1986 |volume=21 |pages=43–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; re-commenced the conversation MacLean began during his career and helped to bring his ideas and this term to Australian records continuum thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bwalya |first1=K. J. |last2=Mnjama |first2=N. M. |last3=Sebina |first3=P. M. I. M. |year=2014 |title=Concepts and Advances in Information Knowledge Management: Studies from Developing and Emerging Economies |publisher=Chandos Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atherton's use of the term records continuum has several significant differences in conception, application and heritage when compared to Australian records continuum thinking.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1994 |chapter=In Search of the Continuum: Ian Maclean's "Australian Experience" Essays on Recordkeeping |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |title=The Records Continuum: Ian Maclean and Australian Archives: first fifty years |publisher=Ancora Press |place=Clayton |isbn=086862019X |pages=110–130 |url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/records_continuum_research_group_publications/items/itemKey/5PX3PN3N/q/in%20search%20of%20the%20continuum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-custodiality as an archival concept plays a major role in how the RCM was conceived. This term was born from an identified and urgent need to address the complexities of computer technologies on records creation and management over time and space.&lt;ref name="U&amp;M1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Upward |first1=F. |last2=McKemmish |first2=S |year=1994 |title=Somewhere beyond custody: literature review |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=136–149 |url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/records_continuum_research_group_publications/items/itemKey/RHKH3WD5/q/somewhere%20beyond }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-custodiality is discussed by Frank Upward and Sue McKemmish in 1994 as part of an exploration of changes in archival discourse commencing in the 1980s by Gerald Ham and expanded on by [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]] as part of a "post-custodial paradigm shift".&lt;ref name="U&amp;M1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ham |first=F. G. |year=1981 |title=Archival strategies for the post-custodial era |journal=American Archivist |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=207–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=T. |authorlink=Terry Cook (archivist) |year=1994 |title=Electronic records, paper minds: the revolution in information management and archives in the post-custodial and post-modernist era |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=300–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-custodiality in relation to the RCM is explored by Upward and McKemmish as an entry point into a wider conversation about records and recordkeeping being part of a process in which archival institutions have a part to play beyond that of the archival authority handling, [[Archival appraisal|appraisal]], describing and arranging physical objects in their custody.

Drawing from the above theoretical foundations, the RCM as a framework acknowledges the central role that recordkeeping activities have on the creation, capture, organization and ongoing management of records over time and throughout spaces such as organizations and institutional archives. Recordkeeping is a practice and a concept clearly defined in the archival and records literature by continuum writers as "a broad and inclusive concept of integrated recordkeeping and archiving processes for current, regulatory, and historical recordkeeping purposes".&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt; Recordkeeping refers to the activities performed on records that add new contexts such as capturing a record into a system, adding metadata, or selecting it for an archive. In the RCM records are therefore not defined according to their status as objects. Rather, records are understood as being part of a continuum of activity related to known (as well as potentially unknown) contexts. A record (as well as records, collections and archives) are therefore part of larger social, cultural, political, legal and archival processes. It is these contexts that are vital to understanding the role, value and evidential qualities of records in and across spacetime (past, present and potential future).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2005 |chapter=The Records Continuum |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Reed |editor4-first=F. |editor4-last=Upward |title=Archives: Recordkeeping in Society |pages=197–222 |place=Wagga Wagga, NSW |publisher=Centre for Information Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other information continuum models ==

The RCM is the most well-known of all the continuum models created, but does not exist in isolation. Several other complementary models have been created by RCM creator Frank Upward, and there are others created by continuum researchers that offer enhanced or alternative ways of understanding the continuum.

The series of continuum models created by Frank Upward include:&lt;ref name="Upw2000"/&gt;
* Information Systems (Data) Continuum Model (data modeling and data flow)
* Cultural Heritage Continuum Model (the stories the documents tell and the significance of those stories to others)
* Publication (Access) Continuum Model (the reach of accessibility and the way the document is issued)

Models created in collaboration:
* Information Continuum Model (Barbara Reed, Don Schauder, Frank Upward) (the technologies driving the system and classification methods)

Other models:
* Juridical contexts of the Records Continuum Model (Livia Iacovino)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iacovino |first=Livia |year=2006 |chapter=Legal and social relationships: an alternative Internet regulatory model |title=Recordkeeping, Ethics and Law |pages=253–300 |place=Dordrecht |publisher=Springer Netherlands |ISBN=978-1-4020-4691-9 |url=https://www.springer.com/law/book/978-1-4020-4691-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''reversible lane''' ([[British English]]: '''tidal flow''') is a lane in which traffic may travel in either direction, depending on certain conditions. Typically, it is meant to improve traffic flow during rush hours, by having overhead [[traffic light]]s and lighted [[street sign]]s notify [[driving|driver]]s which lanes are open or closed to driving or turning.

Reversible lanes are also commonly found in tunnels and on bridges, and on the surrounding roadways – even where the lanes are not regularly reversed to handle normal changes in traffic flow.  The presence of lane controls allows authorities to close or reverse lanes when unusual circumstances (such as construction or a traffic mishap) require use of fewer or more lanes to maintain orderly flow of traffic.

==Separation of flows==
Some more recent implementations of reversible lanes use a [[Barrier transfer machine|movable barrier]] to establish a physical separation between allowed and disallowed lanes of travel. In some systems, a concrete barrier is moved during low-traffic periods to switch a central lane from one side of the road to another; some examples are the five-lane [[San Diego–Coronado Bridge|San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge]] in [[San Diego, California]], the former seven-lane [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955–2017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]] on the [[Hudson River]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] and the eight-lane [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] across the [[Waitematā Harbour]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. Other systems use retractable cones or [[bollard]]s which are built into the road, or retractable fences which can divert traffic from a reversible ramp.  The two center lanes of the six-lane [[Golden Gate Bridge]] are reversible; they are southbound during morning rush hour and northbound at evening rush hour.  Prior to the installation of a movable median barrier in January 2015, they were demarcated by vertical yellow markers placed manually in sockets in the roadway.

Many urban freeways have entirely separate carriageways (and connecting ramps) to hold reversible lanes (the reversible lanes in such a configuration are often referred to as "[[express lane]]s"). Generally, traffic flows in one direction or another in such a configuration (or not at all); the carriageways are not "split" into two-lane roadways during non-rush periods. Typically, this sort of express lane will have fewer interchanges than the primary lanes, and many such roadways only provide onramps for inbound traffic, and offramps for outbound traffic.

==Passing lanes==

[[Image:Suicide lane.svg|thumb|right|Typical{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[road striping|striping]] on an old-style suicide lane setup in the United States]] &lt;!-- tagged {{fact}} because yellow centerlines were far from universal in the days when these lanes were widely used --&gt;

Historically, the term "suicide lane" has also referred to a lane in the center of a highway meant for [[overtaking|passing]] in both directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author= Richard F. Weingroff |title=How the Uncommon Became the Commonplace |journal=Public Roads |issue=January/February 2015 |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/15janfeb/04.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither direction has the [[Right-of-way (traffic)|right-of-way]], and both directions are permitted to use the lane for passing. In a similar layout, three lanes are striped with two in one direction and one in the other, but traffic in the direction with one lane is allowed to cross the centerline to pass.

[[2+1 road]]s have replaced some of these, mainly in Europe.

==Turn lanes and flush medians==
[[File:HillsideRdCaversham.jpg|thumb|A turn lane (in New Zealand a "flush median") with a raised median in the forefront]]

[[Image:Citystreet.svg|thumb|A typical five-lane arterial equipped with a center turn lane. These are often found in cities, towns and developed areas near cities. In the United States, the sequence line is located on the inside of the lane (sometimes with left turn arrows for both flows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Map satellite image of West Caldwell NJ|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?q=west+caldwell+nj&amp;ll=40.849403,-74.297318&amp;spn=0.001176,0.001825&amp;safe=on&amp;hnear=West+Caldwell,+Essex,+New+Jersey&amp;t=h&amp;z=20|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). In Canada it is the same for all provinces with the exception of Ontario, where the sequence line is located on the outside.]]

Another type of center two-way lane is a "two-way left turn lane" (TWLT) or "center left-turn lane", or (for countries that [[drive on the right]]) "center turn lane" or "median turn lane", a single lane in the center of the road into which traffic from both directions pulls to make a left turn. While this is sometimes also called a "suicide lane", it is actually far safer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/10053/ |title= Evaluation of Lane Reduction "Road Diet" Measures on Crashes|date= April 12, 2012 |publisher= U.S. [[Federal Highway Administration]] |accessdate= June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as traffic collisions occur at far lower speeds.

These roads are very common in suburban areas and less common in rural areas, though they are frequent around developed areas near [[Interstate Highway]] bypasses in the United States. Many were divided highways before the median was demolished or otherwise replaced by the turn lane. Many four-lane streets with a center [[double yellow line#United States|double yellow line]] are being phased out in favor of 3- or five-lane streets with center turn lanes because the center lane allows for less disruption of traffic flow.&lt;ref&gt;3 lane roads such as this are typically created as part of a "[[road diet]]," with remainder of the road becoming bicycle lanes.&lt;/ref&gt; For routes with moderate traffic, other movements involve downgrading four-lane undivided streets to three-lane streets with a turn-only center lane.

This center lane can be used by emergency vehicles like police cars, ambulance, and fire trucks to avoid traffic traveling in either direction. Drivers are not allowed to use the center lane of such a highway for passing slow-moving vehicles, except when funding or space constraints dictate use of it as a rush hour "travel lane" when traffic is largely asymmetric between a central business district and its suburbs. [[U.S. Route 13]] near the [[Greenville, North Carolina]], city limits is a rare instance of a posted warning sign that states "do not pass in center lane".

===Lane controls and no (or minimal) physical separation===
;Trans-national
* The [[Peace Bridge]] between the U.S. and Canada, connecting [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] to [[Buffalo, New York]]. Three lanes total, all marked reversible, one reversed in the direction of rush hour flow with the possibility of all lanes flowing in the same direction based on traffic needs.
* The [[Lewiston-Queenston Bridge]] connecting [[Niagara-on-the-Lake|Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario]] to [[Lewiston, New York]]. Five lanes total, all marked as reversible, one to four lanes marked daily in the same direction, depending on traffic needs. In addition to the directional signals, special signals are also fitted to specify what type of vehicle may use the lane.

;Australia
* The [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]] (eight lanes total, three (formerly four) potentially reversible, three reversed daily. Morning peak, six south, two north. Afternoon peak, three south, five north. Other times, four south, four north).
* The [[Spit Bridge]], Sydney, New South Wales (4 lanes total. Morning peak 3 south, 1 north. Afternoon peak 3 north, 1 south. All other times 2 north, 2 south).
* The [[Alfords Point Bridge]] in the south-western suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales. Three lanes total, with the centre lane reversible using manual placement of plastic bollards. Originally this bridge was built with two lanes, and was to be part of twin spans, but only the foundations and excavations for approach works were built for the Eastern span, and the bridge was opened with one lane used in each direction. New approach works commenced in January 2007 for the second span, at a cost of 45 million AUD, eliminating the need for a reversible lane. However, a 300-metre reversible centre lane will still remain on Alfords Point Road over Henry Lawson Drive, approximately 500 meters north of this proposed bridge.
* General Holmes Drive generally has four north and four south lanes, but during morning peak hour one southbound lane is divided from the others with a plastic island with signs placed along the top.

* [[U.S. Route 29]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]
** This road is the access road to [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] from the city, and links to Interstate 485.  It is used for any events at the Speedway.
* Gate City Blvd. in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]]
** The lanes have rarely been reversed (even for special events that cause traffic to back up for miles) and the city has finally removed them, converting the street to three south-bound lanes, two north-bound lanes, and one left-turn lane.
* Edwards Mill Road in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]
[[Ohio]]
* At least one road in [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]] has reversible lanes, for the purpose of allowing quick departure of [[Cedar Point]] guests.

[[Texas]]
* West Alabama Street and North Main Street in [[Houston]] – both are three-lane streets, which operate in a 2 in, 1 out configuration during the morning rush, a 1 in, 2 out configuration during the evening rush, and a 1 each way + two-way left turn lane at other times.
[[Utah]]
* 5400 South ([[Utah State Route 173|State Route 173]]) in Salt Lake County between 1900 West and [[Utah State Route 154|Bangerter Highway]] has seven lanes, three of which are reversible and include a center turning lane at all times.
[[Virginia]]

===Lane controls and physical separation===
* The [[A38(M) motorway]] (also known as the Aston Expressway) in [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. The road connects the city centre with [[Gravelly Hill Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]] on the [[M6 motorway|M6]]. It is a 2-mile, 7-lane section of motorway with no central reservation, and a lower than usual speed limit of 50&amp;nbsp;mph. Constructed in 1971, it was the United Kingdom's first contraflow road. Overhead lane control signals allow for 4 lanes in and 2 out in the morning rush hour, reversed in the evening, and 3 lanes each way at all other times. One dividing lane is closed to traffic at all times, and motorcycles are permanently prohibited from using the central, red-surfaced lane (with a fixed sign) owing to its use as an off-camber drain. The lane control signals can be set to allow travel in either direction for any lane in exceptional circumstances, which has been used for single-lane, reduced-speed running in each direction (or 2+1 with no divider) during road work, allowing the expressway to remain largely open even during major repairs. However, the 7-lane section splits at both ends to fully divided sets of 4x2 lane slip roads, with the central red lane ending in a barrier, so full use of this flexibility is uncommon and occasional overnight closure is required.
* [[U.S. Route 78]] in [[Snellville, Georgia]], United States, has 6 lanes in total. This occurs from the [[limited-access road|limited access]] portion through [[Stone Mountain|Stone Mountain Park]] to [[Georgia State Route 124|Georgia State Route 124 (Scenic Highway)]] for several miles. The middle two lanes were reversible (usually occurring during rush hour) with a varying lane always reserved as a center turn lane; hence 3 lanes were used for one direction of travel and 2 for the other. [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=33.834926~-84.080252&amp;style=o&amp;lvl=2&amp;scene=1081432 Example of an intersection on U.S. 78]. However, due to rising traffic volumes during peak hours that made traffic flows equivalent, the reversible lane system was removed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajc.com/news/gwinnett/reversible-lane-on-us-124429.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Caldecott Tunnel]] between [[Oakland, California]] and [[Contra Costa County, California]] previously had three separate bores, with the middle bore switching direction twice daily for rush hour traffic.  A fourth tunnel bore opened in November 2013 to westbound traffic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caldecott-tunnel.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Two bores are now permanently used by westbound traffic, and the other two by eastbound traffic, with no reversible lanes.
* The [[Elbe Tunnel (1975)|Elbe Tunnel]] near [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] is part of the [[Bundesautobahn 7|Bundesautobahn A7]] and has four separate bores, of which two can be switched to allow travel either in each direction or unidirectionally.

Traffic flow is unidirectional on up to three roadways at a time, in different combinations, depending on demand. Since this highway system is the only quick route from [[São Paulo]] to the beach, the majority of the traffic on Fridays and Sundays are cars on weekend trips, creating highly asymmetrical demand.
* In [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway]] between the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and Calvert St. is converted from two lanes in each direction to one-way southbound in the morning and one-way northbound in the evening rush hour Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. The P Street exit, usually unavailable northbound, is an allowed left exit in the evening. South of Virginia Avenue, two lanes are closed during rush hours to facilitate the merge to or from Virginia Avenue. There are no overhead markings, but police barricades block wrong-way entrances to the roadway.&lt;ref name=wtop /&gt;
* [[Canal Road (Washington, D.C.)|Canal Road]] in Washington, D.C. (between Foxhall Road and Arizona Avenue)&lt;ref name=wtop /&gt;
* [[Sherman Access (Hamilton, Ontario)|Sherman Access]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. 2 lanes total, both marked as reversible, with both lanes flowing in the same direction during rush hour each weekday.
*  Assembly Street and Bluff Road (both part of South Carolina 48), along with Shop Road and George Rogers Boulevard in Columbia, South Carolina, are one-way during [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|University of South Carolina football]] games at [[Williams-Brice Stadium]].
* The lower deck of the [[Centre Street Bridge (Calgary)|Centre Street Bridge]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] is fully reversible. It normally allows for two way traffic, but both lanes flow in the same direction during rush hour each day.
* [[Victoria Bridge (Montreal)|Victoria Bridge]], in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], normally allows for two-way traffic. But during rush hours, it only allows one-way traffic, northbound in the morning, and southbound in the afternoon.
* Farnam Street in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] is a normally two-way, two-lane street that during rush hour becomes one-way eastbound in the morning and westbound in the evening.
* Sierichstraße in [[Hamburg|Hamburg, Germany]], a fully reversible, two-lane city street.
*The [[4th Street Bridge]] in [[Los Angeles]], a fully reversible street controlled by overhead signals. It switches direction every rush hour and on weekends. In case of emergencies, the bridge can be one-way to or from Los Angeles.
*The [[White Nile Bridge]] connecting [[Khartoum]] and [[Omdurman]] in [[Sudan]], with 4 lanes total. Traffic is generally directed equally, 2 lanes to Khartoum and to lanes from except in the morning, where it's 3 lanes towards Khartoum, and in the evening, 3 lanes towards Omdurman.
* In Hong Kong, most vehicular tunnels are dual tube. In the early hours one of the tubes will be closed, and one of the lanes in the other tube carries reversed traffic.
* The [[Baker–Barry Tunnel]], one of only two means of access to the [[Marin Headlands]] from [[U.S. Route 101]] in [[Marin County, California]], is not wide enough to accommodate bidirectional traffic.  It consists of a single reversible lane for automobiles and two bicycle lanes.  The direction of automobile traffic alternates every five minutes, controlled by a traffic light at each end of the tunnel.  The bicycle lanes, one for each direction, are located on either side of the reversible lane; buttons on either side of the tunnel trigger flashing signs alerting drivers entering the tunnel to the presence of cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkbikemarin.org/news.php?id=50 Innovations in Marin County: The Baker-Barry Tunnel]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entire roadway formerly reversed===
* The [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] was the world's longest exclusively one-way reversible road. It opened in 1997 and eventually traversed {{convert|21|km}} though the city's southern suburbs, until its duplication to carry two-way traffic completed in 2014. It changed direction to carry peak hour traffic to the city centre in the morning and away from the city in the evening. On weekends, the directions were reversed.

== Escalators ==
In shopping centres and [[rail rapid transit|metro]] stations there may be an odd number of escalators, with one or more escalators running in different directions in different time of a day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2556">The '''Reynolds–Sorgi Incident''' refers to an American [[college football]] in-game incident in which [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] linebacker [[Robert Reynolds (football player)|Robert Reynolds]] choked [[Wisconsin Badgers]] quarterback [[Jim Sorgi]], injuring Sorgi's [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], after the play had been whistled dead. Sorgi was unable to play for the remainder of the game, struggling to breathe and unable to speak.

==The game==
On October 11, 2003, the Buckeyes entered the game as the defending national champions, ranked #3 in the country and on a 19-game winning streak with a record of 5–0. The unranked Badgers came into the game at 5–1, having lost at home to UNLV. The Badgers were without star running back Anthony Davis, who was recovering from a fractured eye-socket caused by a late-hit. The game was played at the Badgers' home [[Camp Randall Stadium]].

Midway through the third quarter, Sorgi scrambled for an eight-yard gain before being brought down by a convergence of OSU tacklers. After the play was called dead, Reynolds grabbed Sorgi's throat with his hand as Sorgi lay on his back. Sorgi's vocal cords were bruised, he had a hard time breathing, and he was unable to speak. He would not return to the game, and though Reynolds was not whistled for a foul, the Badgers came back to win the game.

After the game, [[Big Ten]] commissioner [[James Delany]] commented, "(Reynolds' actions) have no place in our game." Buckeyes coach [[Jim Tressel]] initially claimed he didn't see the play but later said "Robert's conduct was totally unacceptable and has no place in intercollegiate athletics." Ohio State suspended Reynolds for one game and Reynolds issued a public apology.

Years later, on October 28, 2011, Robert Reynolds came forward to make another public apology, stating that he wanted to put the incident behind him and teach his four children about being accountable and moving on from their mistakes. Reynolds also said that he and Sorgi had made amends not long after the incident occurred, something for which Reynolds said he was very grateful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13317">In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[abstract algebra]], a '''rng''' (or '''[[pseudo-ring]]''' or '''non-unital ring''') is an [[algebraic structure]] satisfying the same properties as a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], without assuming the existence of a multiplicative identity. The term "rng" (pronounced ''rung'') is meant to suggest that it is a "ring" without "i", i.e. without the requirement for an "identity element".

There is no consensus in the community as to whether the existence of a multiplicative identity must be one of the ring axioms (see the [[Ring (mathematics)#History|history section]] of the article on [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]]). The term "rng" was coined to alleviate this ambiguity when people want to refer explicitly to a ring without the axiom of multiplicative identity.

A number of algebras of functions considered in [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] are not unital, for instance the algebra of functions decreasing to zero at infinity, especially those with [[compact support]] on some (non-[[compact space|compact]]) space.

{{Algebraic structures |Ring}}

== Definition ==

Formally, a '''rng''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''R'' with two [[binary operations]] {{nowrap|(+, ·)}} called ''addition'' and ''multiplication'' such that
* (''R'', +) is an [[abelian group]],
* (''R'', ·) is a [[semigroup]],
* Multiplication [[distributive law|distributes]] over addition.

Rng [[homomorphism]]s are defined in the same way as [[ring homomorphism]]s except that the requirement {{nowrap|1=''f''(1) = 1}} is dropped. That is, a '''rng homomorphism''' is a function {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' → ''S''}} from one rng to another such that
* ''f''(''x'' + ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''f''(''y'')
* ''f''(''x'' · ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') · ''f''(''y'')
for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R''.

== Examples ==

All rings are rngs. A simple example of a rng that is not a ring is given by the [[even number|even integers]] with the ordinary addition and multiplication of integers. Another example is given by the set of all 3-by-3 real [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] whose bottom row is zero. Both of these examples are instances of the general fact that every (one- or two-sided) [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] is a rng.

Rngs often appear naturally in [[functional analysis]] when [[linear operator]]s on infinite-[[dimension (linear algebra)|dimensional]] [[vector space]]s are considered.  Take for instance any infinite-dimensional vector space ''V'' and consider the set of all linear operators {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' → ''V''}} with finite [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] (i.e. {{nowrap|dim ''f''(''V'') &lt; ∞}}). Together with addition and [[functional composition|composition]] of operators, this is a rng, but not a ring. Another example is the rng of all real [[sequence]]s that [[limit of a sequence|converge to]] 0, with component-wise operations.

Also, many [[test function]] spaces occurring in the [[theory of distributions]] consist of functions
decreasing to zero at infinity, like e.g. [[Schwartz space]]. Thus, the function everywhere equal to one, which would be the only possible identity element for pointwise multiplication, cannot exist in such spaces, which therefore are rngs (for pointwise addition and multiplication). In particular, the real-valued [[continuous function]]s with [[compact space|compact]] [[support (mathematics)|support]] defined on some [[topological space]], together with pointwise addition and multiplication, form a rng; this is not a ring unless the underlying space is [[compact space|compact]].

== Properties ==

Ideals and [[quotient ring]]s can be defined for rngs in the same manner as for rings. The ideal theory of rngs is complicated by the fact that a nonzero rng, unlike a nonzero ring, need not contain any [[maximal ideal]]s. Some theorems of [[ring theory]] are false for rngs.

A rng homomorphism {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' → ''S''}} maps any [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]] to an idempotent element; this applies in particular to 1&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; if it exists.

If ''R'' and ''S'' are rings, a rng homomorphism {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' → ''S''}} whose image contains a non-zero-divisor maps 1&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; to 1&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Adjoining an identity element ==

Every rng ''R'' can be turned into a ring ''R''^ by adjoining an identity element.  The most general way in which to do this is to formally add an identity element 1 and let ''R''^ consist of integral linear combinations of 1 and elements of ''R''.  That is, elements of ''R''^ are of the form
:''n'' &amp;middot; 1 + ''r''
where ''n'' is an [[integer]] and {{nowrap|''r'' ∈ ''R''}}.  Multiplication is defined by linearity:
:(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;middot; (''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

More formally, we can take ''R''^ to be the [[cartesian product]] {{nowrap|'''Z''' × ''R''}} and define addition and multiplication by
:(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),
:(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;middot; (''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
The multiplicative identity of ''R''^ is then {{nowrap|(1, 0)}}.  There is a natural rng homomorphism {{nowrap|''j'' : ''R'' → ''R''^}} defined by {{nowrap|1=''j''(''r'') = (0, ''r'')}}.  This map has the following [[universal property]]:
:Given any ring ''S'' and any rng homomorphism {{nowrap|''f'' : ''R'' → ''S''}}, there exists a unique ring homomorphism {{nowrap|''g'' : ''R''^ → ''S''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f'' = ''gj''}}.
The map ''g'' can be defined by {{nowrap|1=''g''(''n'', ''r'') = ''n'' · 1&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''f''(''r'')}}.  In a sense then, ''R''^ is "the most general" ring containing ''R''.

There is a natural surjective ring homomorphism {{nowrap|''R''^ → '''Z'''}} which sends {{nowrap|(''n'', ''r'')}} to ''n''.  The [[kernel (ring theory)|kernel]] of this homomorphism is the image of ''R'' in ''R''^.  Since ''j'' is injective, we see that ''R'' is embedded as a (two-sided) [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in ''R''^ with the [[quotient ring]] ''R''^/''R'' isomorphic to '''Z'''.  It follows that
:''Every rng is an ideal in some ring, and every ideal of a ring is a rng.''

Note that ''j'' is never surjective.  So even when ''R'' already has an identity element the ring ''R''^ will be a larger one with a different identity.

The process of adjoining an identity element to a rng can be formulated in the language of [[category theory]].  If we denote the [[category of all rings]] and ring homomorphisms by '''Ring''' and the category of all rngs and rng homomorphisms by '''Rng''', then '''Ring''' is a (nonfull) [[subcategory]] of '''Rng'''.  The construction of ''R''^ given above yields a [[left adjoint]] to the  [[inclusion functor]] {{nowrap|''I'' : '''Ring''' → '''Rng'''}}.  This means that '''Ring''' is a [[reflective subcategory]] of '''Rng''' with reflector {{nowrap|''j'' : ''R'' → ''R''^}}.

== Properties weaker than having an identity ==

There are several properties that have been considered in the literature that are weaker than having an identity element, but not so general. 
For example:

* Rings with enough idempotents: A rng ''R'' is said to be a ring with enough idempotents when there exists a subset ''E'' of ''R'' given by idempotents (i.e. {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''}} for all ''e'' in ''E'') orthogonal (i.e. {{nowrap|1=''ef'' = 0}} for all {{nowrap|''e'' ≠ ''f''}} in ''E'') such that {{nowrap|1=''R'' = {{big|⊕}}&lt;sub&gt;''e''∈''E''&lt;/sub&gt; ''eR'' = {{big|⊕}}&lt;sub&gt;''e''∈''E''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Re''}}.
* Rings with local units: A rng ''R'' is said to be a ring with local units in case for every finite set ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''r&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''R'' we can find ''e'' in ''R'' such that {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''}} and {{nowrap|1=''er&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;e''}} for every ''i''.
* ''s''-unital rings: A rng ''R'' is said to be ''s''-unital in case for every finite set ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''r&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''R'' we can find ''s'' in ''R'' such that {{nowrap|1=''sr&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;s''}} for every ''i''.
* Firm rings: A rng ''R'' is said to be firm if the canonical homomorphism {{nowrap|''R'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''R'' → ''R''}} given by {{nowrap|''r'' ⊗ ''s'' ↦ ''rs''}} is an isomorphism.
* Idempotent rings: A rng ''R'' is said to be idempotent (or an irng) in case {{nowrap|1=''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''R''}}, that is, for every element ''r'' of ''R'' we can find elements ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''R'' such that &lt;math&gt;r = \Sigma_i r_i s_i&lt;/math&gt;.

It is not hard to check that these properties are weaker than having an identity element and weaker than the previous one.

* Rings are rings with enough idempotents, using {{nowrap|1=''E'' = {1}.}} A ring with enough idempotents that has no identity is for example the ring of infinite matrices over a field with just a finite number of nonzero entries. The matrices that have just 1 over one element in the main diagonal and 0 otherwise are the orthogonal idempotents.
* Rings with enough idempotents are rings with local units just taking finite sums of the orthogonal idempotents to satisfy the definition.
* Rings with local units are in particular ''s''-unital; ''s''-unital rings are firm and firm rings are idempotent.

== Rng of square zero ==

A '''rng of square zero''' is a rng ''R'' such that {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = 0}} for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;See Bourbaki, p.&amp;nbsp;102, where it is called a pseudo-ring of square zero.  Some other authors use the term "zero ring" to refer to any rng of square zero; see e.g. {{harvtxt|Szele|1949}} and {{harvtxt|Kreinovich|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Any [[abelian group]] can be made a rng of square zero by defining the multiplication so that {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = 0}} for all ''x'' and ''y'';&lt;ref&gt;Bourbaki, p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt; thus every abelian group is the additive group of some rng.
The only rng of square zero with a multiplicative identity is the [[zero ring]] {0}.&lt;ref&gt;Bourbaki, p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any additive [[subgroup]] of a rng of square zero is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]].  Thus a rng of square zero is [[simple ring|simple]] if and only if its additive group is a simple abelian group, i.e., a [[cyclic group]] of prime order.&lt;ref&gt;Zariski and Samuel, p.&amp;nbsp;133.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unital homomorphism ==

Given two unital algebras ''A'' and ''B'', an algebra [[homomorphism]]

:''f'' : ''A'' → ''B''

is '''unital''' if it maps the identity element of ''A'' to the identity element of ''B''.

If the associative algebra ''A'' over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is ''not'' unital, one can adjoin an identity element as follows: take {{nowrap|''A'' × ''K''}} as underlying ''K''-[[vector space]] and define multiplication ∗ by

:(''x'',''r'') ∗ (''y'',''s'') = (''xy'' + ''sx'' + ''ry'', ''rs'')

for ''x'',''y'' in ''A'' and ''r'',''s'' in ''K''. Then ∗ is an associative operation with identity element (0,1). The old algebra ''A'' is contained in the new one, and in fact {{nowrap|1=''A'' × ''K''}} is the "most general" unital algebra containing ''A'', in the sense of [[universal construction]]s.

{{nihongo|'''Sada Abe'''|阿部 定|Abe Sada|extra=May 28, 1905 – after 1971}} was a [[Japanese woman]], a [[geisha]] and prostitute, who is remembered for [[erotic asphyxiation|erotically asphyxiating]] her lover, {{nihongo|'''Kichizō Ishida'''|石田 吉蔵}}, on May 18, 1936, and then cutting off his [[penis]] and [[testicle]]s and carrying them around with her in her [[kimono]]. The story became a national sensation in Japan, acquiring mythic overtones, and has been interpreted by artists, philosophers, novelists and filmmakers.&lt;ref name="Thompson-1570"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1985|p=1570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abe was released after having served 5 years in prison and went on to write an autobiography.

==Family background==
Sada Abe was the seventh of eight children of Shigeyoshi and Katsu Abe, an [[upper middle-class]] family of [[tatami|tatami mat]] makers in Tokyo's [[Kanda, Tokyo|Kanda]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Johnston-20"/&gt; Only four of the Abe children survived to adulthood, and of those, Sada was the youngest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=21, 25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Abe's father, Shigeyoshi Abe, was originally from [[Chiba Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="Johnston-20"/&gt; He had been adopted into the Abe family to help with the business, which he eventually inherited.&lt;ref name="Johnston-20"/&gt; Aged 52 at the time of Sada's birth, Shigeyoshi Abe was described by police as "an honest and upright man" who had neither conspicuous vices nor any brushes with the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=20, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some acquaintances reported him to be somewhat self-centered, with a taste for extravagance. Sada's mother, Katsu Abe, likewise had no known legal or moral blemishes on her record.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=21, 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her brother Shintarō was known as a womanizer, and after his marriage, ran away with his parents' money.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=21, 171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sada's sister Teruko was also known to have had several lovers. Her father sent her to work in a [[brothel]], then not an uncommon way to punish female sexual promiscuity in Japan, although he soon bought her back. Teruko's past was not considered a hindrance to marriage for those of the Abes' class at the time, and she soon married.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"&gt;{{harvnb|Honjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sada Abe was born in 1905.&lt;ref name="Johnston-25"/&gt; Her mother doted on Sada, who was her youngest surviving child, and allowed her to do as she wished.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; She encouraged Abe to take lessons in singing and in playing the ''[[shamisen]]'', both activities which, at the time, were more closely associated with [[geisha|geishas]] and prostitutes than with classical artistic endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=26-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geishas were considered glamorous celebrities at the time,&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; and Abe herself pursued this image by skipping school for her musical lessons, and wearing stylish make-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; As family problems over her siblings, sister Teruko and brother Shintarō, became more pressing, Abe was often sent out of the house alone. She soon fell in with a group of similarly independent teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 14, during one of her outings with this group, she was raped by one of her acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;Abe, Sada quoted in ''Second Interrogation of Abe Sada'' in {{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=169}} Chapter "Notes from the Police Interrogation of Abe Sada": ''While we were playing around on the second floor he forced himself into me.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abe, Sada quoted in {{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=45}}, Chapter 5. "Acquaintance Rape", ''.. in the summer of my fifteenth year because I was raped by a student at a friend's house&amp;nbsp;...''&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents initially defended and supported her, but she became a difficult teenager.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; As she became more irresponsible and uncontrollable, her parents sold her to a geisha house in [[Yokohama]] in 1922, hoping to find her a place in society with some direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=58}}, {{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toku Abe, Sada's oldest sister, testified that Sada wished to become a geisha. Sada herself, however, claimed that her father made her a geisha as punishment for her promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abe's encounter with the geisha world proved to be a frustrating and disappointing one. To become a true star among geisha required apprenticeship from childhood with years spent training and studying arts and music. Abe never progressed beyond a low rank, at which one of her main duties was to provide sex for clients. She worked for five years in this capacity, and eventually contracted [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; Since this meant she would be required to undergo regular physical examinations, as would a legally licensed prostitute, Abe decided to enter that better-paying profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=66-67}}, {{harvnb|Honjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 1930s==
[[File:TAISHO-ROU 大正楼、阿部定が最後に勤めた遊郭、P9200158.JPG|thumb|alt=|The brothel where Abe was arrested]]
Abe began work as a prostitute in [[Osaka]]'s famous [[Tobita Shinchi|Tobita brothel district]], but soon gained a reputation as a trouble-maker. She stole money from clients, and attempted to leave the brothel several times, but was soon tracked down by the well-organized legal prostitution system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=67-71}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years, she eventually succeeded in escaping the licensed prostitution system, and began working as a waitress. However, not satisfied with the wages, she was soon working as a prostitute again, though now unlicensed, and began working in the unlicensed brothels of Osaka in 1932. Abe's mother died in January 1933, and Abe traveled to Tokyo to visit her father, and her mother's grave. She entered into the prostitution market in Tokyo and while there became a mistress for the first time. When her father became gravely ill in January 1934, Abe nursed him for ten days until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=72–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1934 Abe was arrested in a police raid on the unlicensed brothel at which she was working at the time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. He was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. Kasahara set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, "She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even though I am pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on her private parts all night long&amp;nbsp;... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;Deposition by Kasahara Kinnosuke in {{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=165-166}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for [[Nagoya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, "She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, "He didn't love me and treated me like an animal. He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nagoya in 1935, and again intending to leave the sex industry, Abe began working as a maid at a restaurant. She soon became romantically involved with a customer at the restaurant, Gorō Ōmiya, a professor and banker who aspired to become a member of the [[Diet of Japan]] (Japanese parliament). Knowing that the restaurant would not tolerate a maid having sexual relations with clients, and having become bored with Nagoya, she returned to Tokyo in June. Ōmiya met Abe in Tokyo, and, finding that she had in the past contracted syphilis, paid for her stay at a hot springs resort in [[Kusatsu, Gunma|Kusatsu]] from November until January 1936. In January, Ōmiya suggested that Abe could become financially independent by opening a small restaurant, and recommended that she should start working as an apprentice in the restaurant business.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=78–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquaintance with Kichizō Ishida==
Back in Tokyo, Abe began work as an apprentice at the Yoshidaya restaurant on February 1, 1936. The owner of this establishment, Kichizō Ishida, 42 at the time, had worked his way up in business, starting as an apprentice at a restaurant specializing in eel dishes. He had opened the Yoshidaya in Tokyo's [[Nakano, Tokyo|Nakano]] neighborhood in 1920.&lt;ref name="Johnston-11"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Abe joined his restaurant, Ishida had become known as a womanizer who by that time did little in the way of actually running the restaurant, which had become in fact managed primarily by his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after Abe began work at Yoshidaya, Ishida began making amorous advances towards her. Ōmiya had never satisfied Abe sexually, and she gave in to Ishida. In mid-April, Ishida and Abe initiated their sexual relationship in the restaurant to the accompaniment of a romantic ballad sung by one of the restaurant's geishas. On April 23, 1936, Abe and Ishida met for a pre-arranged sexual encounter at a teahouse, or ''machiai''—the contemporary equivalent of a [[love hotel]]&lt;ref name="Schreiber-184"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in the [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] neighborhood. Planning only for a short "fling", the couple instead remained in bed for four days. On the night of April 27, 1936, they moved to another teahouse in the distant neighborhood of [[Futako Tamagawa]] where they continued to drink and have sex, occasionally with the accompaniment of a geisha's singing, and would continue even as maids entered the room to serve [[sake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; They next moved to the Ogu neighborhood, and Ishida did not actually return to his restaurant until the morning of May 8, 1936, after an absence of about two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=84–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of Ishida, Abe later said, "It is hard to say exactly what was so good about Ishida. But it was impossible to say anything bad about his looks, his attitude, his skill as a lover, the way he expressed his feelings. I had never met such a sexy man."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=92, 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their two-week encounter ended, Abe became agitated and began drinking excessively. She said that with Ishida she had come to know true love for the first time in her life, and the thought of Ishida being back with his wife made her intensely jealous. Just over a week before Ishida's eventual death, Abe began to contemplate his murder. On May 9, 1936, she attended a play in which a geisha attacks her lover with a large knife, after which she decided to threaten Ishida with a knife at their next meeting. On May 11, 1936, Abe pawned some of her clothing and used the money to buy a kitchen knife. She later described meeting Ishida that night, "I pulled the kitchen knife out of my bag and threatened him as had been done in the play I had seen, saying, 'Kichi, you wore that kimono just to please one of your favorite customers. You bastard, I'll kill you for that.' Ishida was startled and drew away a little, but he seemed delighted with it all&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=95–99, 192–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Abe Sada Incident"==
[[File:Sada Abe.jpg|thumb|Newspaper photo taken shortly after Abe's arrest, at Takanawa Police Station, Tokyo on May 20, 1936]]
[[File:The scene of the Abe Sada Incident.JPG|thumb|Site of the "Abe Sada Incident"]]
Ishida and Abe returned to Ogu, where they remained until his death. During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife to the base of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her ''[[Obi (sash)|obi]]'' sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during [[orgasm]], and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took 30 tablets of a [[sedative]] called [[Bromisoval|Calmotin]] to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, "You'll put the cord around my neck and squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you&amp;nbsp;... If you start to strangle me, don't stop, because it is so painful afterward." Abe commented that she wondered if he had wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=99–102, 164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 2&amp;nbsp;a.m. on the morning of May 18, 1936, as Ishida was asleep, Abe wrapped her sash twice around his neck and strangled him to death. She later told police, "After I had killed Ishida I felt totally at ease, as though a heavy burden had been lifted from my shoulders, and I felt a sense of clarity." After lying with Ishida's body for a few hours, she next severed his genitalia with the kitchen knife, wrapped them in a magazine cover, and kept them until her arrest three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=102–103, 200–201, 206, {{harvnb|Honjo}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the blood she wrote {{nihongo||定、石田の吉二人キリ|''Sada, Ishida no Kichi Futari-kiri''|"We, Sada and Kichi(zō) Ishida, are alone"}} on Ishida's left [[thigh]], and on a bed sheet. She then carved {{lang|ja|定}} ("Sada", the [[kanji|character]] for her name) into his left arm. After putting on Ishida's underwear, she left the inn at about 8&amp;nbsp;a.m., telling the staff not to disturb Ishida.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-186"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After leaving the inn, Abe met her former lover Gorō Ōmiya. She repeatedly apologized to him, but Ōmiya, unaware of the murder, assumed that she was apologizing for having taken another lover. In actuality, Abe's apologies were for the damage to his political career that she knew his association with her was bound to cause. After Ishida's body was discovered, a search was launched for Abe, who had gone missing. On May 19, 1936, the newspapers picked up the story. Ōmiya's career was ruined, and Abe's life was under intense public scrutiny from that point onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abe Sada panic==
The circumstances of the death of Ishida immediately caused a national sensation. The ensuing frenzy over the search for Abe was called "Abe Sada panic".&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; Police received reports of sightings of Abe from various cities, and one false sighting nearly caused a stampede in the [[Ginza]], resulting in a large traffic jam.&lt;ref name="Johnston-11"/&gt; In a reference to the recent failed coup in Tokyo, the [[February 26 Incident|Ni Ni-Roku Incident]] ("2–26" or "February 26"), the crime was satirically dubbed the "Go Ichi-Hachi" Incident ("5–18" or "May 18").&lt;ref name="Schreiber-184"/&gt;

On May 19, 1936, Abe went shopping and saw a movie. Under a pseudonym, she stayed in an inn in [[Shinagawa]] on May 20, where she had a massage and drank three bottles of beer. She spent the day writing farewell letters to Ōmiya, a friend, and Ishida.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-186"/&gt; She planned to commit suicide one week after the murder, and practiced [[necrophilia]]. "I felt attached to Ishida's penis and thought that only after taking leave from it quietly could I then die. I unwrapped the paper holding them and gazed at his penis and scrotum. I put his penis in my mouth and even tried to insert it inside me&amp;nbsp;... It didn't work however though I kept trying and trying. Then, I decided that I would flee to Osaka, staying with Ishida's penis all the while. In the end, I would jump from a cliff on [[Mount Ikoma]] while holding on to his penis."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 4:00 in the afternoon, police detectives, suspicious of the alias under which Abe had registered, came to her room. "Don't be so formal", she told them, "You're looking for Sada Abe, right? Well that's me. I am Sada Abe." When the police were not convinced, she displayed Ishida's genitalia as proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|pp=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abe was arrested and interrogated over eight sessions.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-187"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why she had severed Ishida's genitalia, Abe replied, "Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. I wanted to take the part of him that brought back to me the most vivid memories."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interrogating officer was struck by Abe's demeanor when asked why she had killed Ishida. "Immediately she became excited and her eyes sparkled in a strange way."&lt;ref name="Johnston-124"/&gt; Her answer was: "I loved him so much, I wanted him all to myself. But since we were not husband and wife, as long as he lived he could be embraced by other women. I knew that if I killed him no other woman could ever touch him again, so I killed him&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Schreiber-188"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; In attempting to explain what distinguished Abe's case from over a dozen other similar cases in Japan,{{cn|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;A book, ''19 nin no Abe Sada'' (''19 Abe Sadas''), detailing similar cases, was published in 1981; and Schreiber, "O-Sada Serves a Grateful Nation" mentions at least 53 cases of women severing male genitalia since the Abe case.&lt;/ref&gt; William Johnston suggests that it is this answer which captured the imagination of the nation. "She had killed not out of jealousy but out of love."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Schreiber notes that the Sada Abe incident occurred at a time when the Japanese media were preoccupied with extreme political and military troubles, including the [[February 26 Incident|''Ni-Ni-Roku'' incident]] and a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|looming full-scale war in China]]. He suggests that a sensationalistic sex scandal such as this served as a welcome national release from the disturbing events of the time.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-184"/&gt; The incident also struck a chord with the ''[[ero guro|ero-guro-nansensu]]'' ("erotic-grotesque-nonsense") style popular at the time, and the Sada Abe Incident came to represent that genre for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=11, 114, 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the details of the crime were made public, rumors began to circulate that Ishida's penis was of extraordinary size; however, the police officer who interrogated Abe after her arrest denied this, saying, "Ishida's was just average. [Abe] told me, 'Size doesn't make a man in bed. Technique and his desire to please me were what I liked about Ishida.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="Johnston-124"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her arrest, Ishida's penis and testicles were moved to [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo University]] Medical School's pathology museum. They were put on public display soon after the end of [[World War II]], but have since disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=190}}, {{harvnb|Honjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction and sentencing==
The first day of Abe's trial was November 25, 1936, and by 5&amp;nbsp;a.m. crowds were already gathering to attend.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-188"/&gt; The judge presiding over the trial admitted to being sexually aroused by some of the details involved in the case, yet made sure that the trial was held with the utmost seriousness.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; Abe's statement before receiving sentencing began, "The thing I regret most about this incident is that I have come to be misunderstood as some kind of sexual pervert&amp;nbsp;... There had never been a man in my life like Ishida. There were men I liked, and with whom I slept without accepting money, but none made me feel the way I did toward him."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 1936, Abe was convicted of murder in the second degree and mutilation of a corpse. Though the prosecution demanded ten years, and Abe claimed that she desired the death penalty, she was in fact sentenced to just six years in prison.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-188"/&gt; She was confined in Tochigi women's penitentiary, where she was prisoner No. 11.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-189"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abe's sentence was [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] on November 10, 1940, on the occasion of the 2,600th anniversary celebrations of the mythical founding of Japan, when [[Emperor Jimmu]] came to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was released, exactly five years after the murder, on May 17, 1941.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-189"/&gt;

The police record of Abe's interrogation and confession became a national best-seller in 1936. Christine L. Marran puts the national fascination with Abe's story within the context of the {{nihongo|''dokufu''|毒婦}} or "poison woman" stereotype, a transgressive female character type that had first become popular in Japanese serialized novels and stage works in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=xiii–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the popular "poison woman" literature, confessional autobiographies by female criminals had begun appearing in the late 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1910s, autobiographical writings by criminal women took on an unapologetic tone and sometimes included criticisms of Japan and Japanese society. [[Kanno Suga]], who was hanged in 1911 for conspiring to assassinate [[Emperor Meiji]] in what was known as the [[High Treason Incident]], wrote openly rebellious essays while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fumiko Kaneko]], who was sentenced to death for plotting to bomb the imperial family, used her notoriety to speak against the imperial system and the racism and paternalism that she said it engendered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abe's confession, in the years since its appearance, became the most circulated female criminal narrative in Japan. Marran points out that Abe, unlike previous criminal autobiographers, stressed her sexuality and the love she felt for her victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Upon release from prison, Abe assumed an [[pseudonym|alias]]. &lt;!--what years?--&gt;As the mistress of a "serious man" she referred to in her memoirs as "Y", she moved first to [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] and then to [[Saitama Prefecture]]. When Abe's true identity became known to Y's friends and family, she broke off their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=148-150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[World War II]], wishing to divert public attention from politics and criticism of the occupying authorities, the [[Shigeru Yoshida|Yoshida]] government encouraged a "3-S" policy—"sports, screen, and sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLelland|2012|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-war writings, such as ''The Psychological Diagnosis of Abe Sada'' (1937) depict Abe as an example of the dangers of unbridled female sexuality and as a threat to the patriarchal system. In the postwar era, she was treated as a critic of totalitarianism, and a symbol of freedom from oppressive political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=136, 140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abe became a popular subject in literature of both high and low quality. The ''[[buraiha]]'' writer [[Sakunosuke Oda|Oda Sakunosuke]] wrote two stories based on Abe,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a June 1949 article noted that Abe had recently tried to clear her name after it had been used in a "mountain" of erotic books.&lt;ref name="Marran 2007, p. 140-141"&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 the writer [[Ango Sakaguchi]] interviewed Abe, treating her as an authority on both sexuality and freedom. Sakaguchi called Abe a "tender, warm figure of salvation for future generations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 Ichiro Kimura's ''The Erotic Confessions of Abe Sada'' became a national best-seller, with over 100,000 copies sold.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-189"/&gt; The book was in the form of an interview with Sada Abe, but was actually based on the police interrogation records. As a response to this book, Abe wrote her own autobiography, ''Memoirs of Abe Sada'', which was published in 1948. In contrast to Kimura's depiction of her as a pervert, she stressed her love for Ishida.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of the magazine {{nihongo|''True Story''|実話|Jitsuwa}}, in January 1948, featured previously unpublished photos of the incident with the headline "[[Ero guro|Ero-guro]] of the Century! First Public Release. Pictorial of the Abe Sada Incident." Reflecting the change in tone in writings on Abe, the June 1949 issue of ''Monthly Reader'' calls her a "Heroine of That Time", for following her own desires in a time of "false morality" and oppression.&lt;ref name="Marran 2007, p. 140-141"/&gt;

Abe capitalized on her notoriety by sitting for an interview in a popular magazine,&lt;ref name="Schreiber-189"/&gt; and appearing for several years starting in 1947 in a traveling one-act stage production called ''Shōwa Ichidai Onna'' (''A Woman of the Shōwa Period'') under the direction of dramatist [[Nagata Mikihiko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 she began working at the Hoshikikusui,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; a working-class pub in Inari-chō in downtown Tokyo. She lived a low-profile life in Tokyo's Shitaya neighborhood for the next 20 years, and her neighborhood restaurant association gave her a "model employee" award.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-190"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than once, during the 1960s, film-critic [[Donald Richie]] visited the Hoshikikusui. In his collection of profiles, ''Japanese Portraits'', he describes Abe making a dramatic entrance into a boisterous group of drinkers. She would slowly descend a long staircase that led into the middle of the crowd, fixing a haughty gaze on individuals in her audience. The men in the pub would respond by putting their hands over their crotches, and shouting out things like, "Hide the knives!" and "I'm afraid to go and pee!" Abe would slap the banister in anger and stare the crowd into an uncomfortable and complete silence, and only then continue her entrance, chatting and pouring drinks from table to table. Richie comments, "...&amp;nbsp;she had actually choked a man to death and then cut off his member. There was a consequent frisson when Sada Abe slapped your back."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richie|1987|pp=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Abe appeared in the "Sada Abe Incident" section of director [[Teruo Ishii]]'s dramatized documentary {{nihongo|''History of Bizarre Crimes by Women in the Meiji Taishō and Shōwa Eras''|明治大正昭和　猟奇女犯罪史|Meiji Taishō Shōwa Ryōki Onna Hanzaishi}},&lt;ref name="Ishii-JMDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1969/cs002880.htm |script-title=ja:明治大正昭和　猟奇女犯罪史 |accessdate=2007-07-26 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vrEjlO7r?url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1969/cs002880.htm |archivedate=January 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last known photograph of Abe was taken in August of that year.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-190"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1969 picture of Abe, age 64, seated next to a tense male dancer can be seen at: {{cite web |url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/%7Emd5s-kzo/abesada.html |title=SADA ABE 阿部定 |accessdate=2007-07-28 |language=Japanese |publisher=asahi-net.or.jp |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vrElM1tu?url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/ |archivedate=January 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She disappeared from the public eye in 1970.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; When the film ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' was being planned in the mid-1970s, director [[Nagisa Oshima]] apparently sought out Abe and, after a long search, found her, her hair shorn, in a [[Kansai]] nunnery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richie|1987|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Decades after both the incident and her disappearance, Sada Abe continues to draw public interest. In addition to the documentary in which Abe herself appeared shortly before she disappeared from the public eye, and the 1976 Japanese-language ''In the Realm of the Senses'', at least three successful films have been made based on the story. The 1983 film, ''Sexy Doll: Abe Sada Sansei'', made use of Abe's name in the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287688/ |title=Sexy doll: Abe Sada sansei |accessdate=2007-07-28 |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vrElpv0h?url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287688/ |archivedate=January 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, a 438-page biography of Abe was published in Japan,&lt;ref name="Schreiber-190"/&gt; and the first full-length book on Abe in English, William Johnston's ''Geisha, Harlot, Strangler, Star: A Woman, Sex, and Morality in Modern Japan'', was published in 2005.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Japanese [[Noise music]]ian [[Merzbow]] adopted the alias Abe Sada for an early musical project. He released only one record under this name, the 1994 7" ''[[Original Body Kingdom/Gala Abe Sada 1936]]''.&lt;ref name=Discogs-Abe-Sada&gt;{{cite web|title=Abe Sada-Original Body Kingdom / Gala Abe Sada 1936|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/359309|work=Discogs Abe Sada discography|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, a four-bass [[noise rock|noise]] band from [[Perth, Western Australia]], named Abe Sada won a Contemporary Music Grant from the Australian Department of Culture and the Arts to tour Japan in June and July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928100148/http://www.dca.wa.gov.au/ContemporaryMusicGrantResults.asp|archivedate=2007-09-28|url=http://www.dca.wa.gov.au/ContemporaryMusicGrantResults.asp|title=Contemporary Music Grant Results|accessdate=2006-06-02|publisher=Department of Culture and the Arts, Government of Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-experimentation''' refers to the special case of [[single-subject research]] in which the experimenter conducts the [[experiment]] on themself. Usually this means that a single person is the designer, operator, subject, analyst, and user or reporter of the experiment.

Current champions of self-experimentation include the late [[Seth Roberts]], [[Tim Ferriss]], and a sprawling  community of [[Quantified Self]]

Human scientific self-experimentation principally (though not necessarily) falls into the fields of medicine and psychology. Self-experimentation has a long and well-documented history in medicine which continues to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Who Goes First?: The Story of Self-Experimentation in Medicine by Lawrence Altman&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, after failed attempts to infect piglets in 1984, [[Barry Marshall]] drank a [[petri dish]] of the [[Helicobacter pylori]] from a patient, and soon developed gastritis, [[achlorhydria]], stomach discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and [[halitosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Gut Instincts: A profile of Nobel laureate Barry Marshall| url=https://news.psu.edu/story/140921/2008/02/04/research/gut-instincts-profile-nobel-laureate-barry-marshall | author = Melissa Beattie-Moss

==Psychology==

The self-experimental approach has long and often been applied to practical psychological problems. [[Benjamin Franklin]] recorded his self-experiment of successively devoting his attention for a week to one of thirteen "Virtues", "leaving the other Virtues to their ordinary Chance, only marking every Evening the Faults of the Day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin | editor = Frank Woodworth Pine | date=1916 | url=https://excellence-in-literature.com/benjamin-franklin-13-virtues/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, Part 2 |url=http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page35.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychology, the best-known self-experiments are the memory studies of [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]], which established many basic characteristics of human memory through tedious experiments involving nonsense syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hermann |last=Ebbinghaus |date=1913 |title=Über das Gedächtnis. Untersuchungen zur experimentellen Psychologie |publisher=NY Teachers College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Self-change: Strategies for solving personal problems'', M. J. Mahoney suggested that self-experimentation be used as a method of psychological treatment, and recommended that clients be taught basic scientific methods, in order that the client become a "personal scientist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Mahoney, M. J. |date = 1979 | title=Self-change: Strategies for solving personal problems | publisher =  New York: Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==

Several popular and well-known sweeteners were discovered by deliberate or sometimes accidental tasting of reaction products. [[Sucralose]] was discovered by a scientist mishearing the instruction to "test" the compounds as to "taste" the compounds.&lt;ref name="Gratzer2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gratzer|first=Walter |title=Eurekas and Euphorias: The Oxford Book of Scientific Anecdotes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eTIxt6sN2oC&amp;pg=PT32|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=28 November 2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280403-7|pages=32–|chapter=5.

[[Cyclamate]] was discovered when a chemist noticed a sweet taste on his cigarette that he had set down on his bench. [[Aspartame]] was also discovered accidentally when chemist Schlatter tasted a sweet substance that had stuck to his hand.  [[Acesulfame potassium]] is another sweetener discovered when a chemist tasted what he had made.

[[Leo Sternbach]], the inventor of [[Librium]] and [[Valium]], tested chemicals that he made on himself, saying in an interview, "I tried everything. Many drugs. Once, in the sixties, I was sent home for two days. It was an extremely potent drug, not a Benzedrine. I slept for a long time. My wife was very worried."&lt;ref&gt;"Little Helper", Nick Paumgarten, ''The New Yorker'', June 16, 2003, pp. 71-72.

Swiss chemist [[Albert Hofmann]] first discovered the [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] properties of [[LSD]] five years after its creation, when he [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide#Discovery|accidentally]] absorbed a small amount of the drug through his fingertips. Days later, he [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide#.22Bicycle Day.22|intentionally]] self-experimented with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shroder|first1=Tom|title='Apparently Useless': The Accidental Discovery of LSD|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/the-accidental-discovery-of-lsd/379564/|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==
[[Charles Dalziel]] studied the effects of electricity on animals and humans, and wrote ''The Effects of Electric Shock on Man'', a book in which he explains the effects of different amounts of electricity on human subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dalziel, Charles F. |title=The effects of electric shock on man|publisher= Washington, D.C. : U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Office of Health and Safety Series: Safety and fire protection technical bulletin; no. 7|year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; He carried out experiments on human subjects, including himself. He also invented the [[ground-fault circuit interrupter]] or GFCI, based on his understanding of electric shock in humans.

In 1998 a British scientist, [[Kevin Warwick]], became the first human being to test an [[RFID]] as an implant to control surrounding technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9901/14/chipman.idg/|title= CNN story: Is human chip implant wave of the future? | date=1999-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 he went on to have an array of 100 electrodes fired into the [[median nerve]] of his left arm during a two-hour neurosurgical operation. With this implant in place, over a three-month period, he conducted a number of experiments, including the first direct electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Schulzrinne, H and Wu, X: "Thought Communication and Control: A First Step using Radiotelegraphy", IEE Proceedings on Communications, 151(3), pp.185-189, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current practitioners of self experimentation==

==In fiction==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Examples in classic fiction include the tales of ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''. In each case the scientist's unorthodox theories lead to permanent change and ultimately to self-destruction.

Self-experimentation is a common trait amongst [[mad scientist]]s and [[villain|evil genius]]es in more contemporary fiction and is part of the creation story of many [[comic book]] [[supervillain]]s, and some [[superhero]]es. For example, the [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Lizard (comics)|The Lizard]] lost his arm in a war (other versions vary), and experimented with reptilian DNA to try to grow it back; however, the therapy caused him to mutate into a half-human-half-reptile creature. The [[Fantastic Four]] were created when the Four were testing Reed Richards's new prototype rocket and were exposed to cosmic rays, giving them super powers. Other cases include the [[Man-Bat]], the [[Ultra-Humanite]], the [[Green Goblin]], and the [[Justice League (animated series)|animated Justice League]] version of [[Cheetah (comics)#Other media|Cheetah]].

The deepest example for self-experimentation was shown in [[Ang Lee]]'s ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (2003), where [[Brian Banner|David Banner]] experimented on himself to improve on his own limits, which is also why [[The Incredible Hulk|his son]] had many different abilities.

The '''September 2010 Quetta bombing''' occurred on 3 September 2010 in [[Quetta]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="bbc20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11177686|title=Quetta rally suicide bomb kills dozens|date=3 September 2010|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least 73 people&lt;ref name="zinhua"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-09/04/c_13477555.htm|title=73 killed in fresh suicide bomb attack in Pakistan|date=4 September 2010|agency=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; were killed and 160 injured when a bomb exploded in a [[Quds Day]] procession which [[Shia]]s were carrying out to express solidarity with Palestinians.&lt;ref name="cnn20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/09/03/pakistan.violence/|title=Pakistan suicide bombing kills 59, injures 160, police say|date=3 September 2010|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/world/asia/04pstan.html|title=Taliban Claim Deadly Attack on Shiites in Pakistan|last=Masood|first=Salman|date=3 September 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Pakistan, which has a mostly [[Sunni]] population, has seen sectarian attacks against minorities including Shias, who account for about 35–40% of Pakistan's population, and are the followers of the Prophet's progeny.&lt;ref name="zinhua"/&gt; Two days prior to these attacks dozens of Shias were killed in a similar [[September 2010 Lahore bombings|attack]] in [[Lahore]]. Sunni militant groups like [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] and [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]] which operate freely in Pakistan have for years targeted minorities including Shias.

On the day prior to this attack Pakistan's interior minister [[Rehman Malik]] had asked the Shia community not to hold large gatherings due to security concerns.&lt;ref name="lat20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-blast-20100904,0,6390463.story|title=Pakistan suicide bombing kills 58|last=Rodriguez|first=Alex|date=3 September 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
The procession was to mark the Quds Day event staged every year by the Shia community to oppose Israel's occupation of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="dawn20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/03-blast-near-meezan-chowk-in-quetta-ss-09|title=Suicide bomber kills 53 at Shia rally in Quetta|date=3 September 2010|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally drew an estimated 2,500 participants, mostly Shiias. The size of the blast caused a stampede.&lt;ref name="zinhua"/&gt; The explosion occurred in the Meezan chowk area of the town. The bomb exploded around 3:05&amp;nbsp;pm local time. It was estimated that the suicide bomber used about 15 kilograms of explosives.&lt;ref name="xinhua2010"/&gt;

===Responsibility===
[[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] claimed responsibility for the attack and said a 22-year-old suicide bomber, Rashid Moaawia, carried out the attack.&lt;ref name="xinhua2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-09/03/c_13477509.htm|title=L-e-J group claims responsibility for suicide blast in Pakistan's Quetta|date=3 September 2010|agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following the blast, widespread protests erupted in the city with gunfire being heard across the city. Several shops were burnt by the protesters.&lt;ref name="xinhua2010"/&gt; People were seen lying on the roads to avoid gunfire, while others set fire to vehicles and buildings to vent their anger.&lt;ref name="dawn20100903"/&gt;

After the blast, police cordoned off the area and fired in the air to hold back people trying to search for their relatives.&lt;ref name="zinhua"/&gt;

Thousands have attended a funeral in the Pakistani city of Quetta for victims of a suicide attack on a Shia Muslim procession.

The death toll from Friday's attack rose from 43 to 65 overnight as critically wounded people died in hospitals, police said on Saturday.

Shops and schools remained closed the following day. Security was also stepped up at mosques across Pakistan.

Thousands attended a funeral mass in Quetta.&lt;ref name="aje20100904x"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/09/2010948413333315.html|title=Pakistan mourns blast victims|date=4 September 2010|publisher=Al Jazeerah English|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] condemned the attack and ordered an investigation. Interior Minister [[Rehman Malik]] told the press that militants want to encourage sectarianism in an effort to destabilise the government following a series of military offensives against them. He also claimed that Punjabi, such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, and al-Qaida and the Tehrik-e-Taliban are one and the same.&lt;ref name="voa20100904"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Pakistani-Flooding-to-Affect-Fight-Against-Militants-102218169.html|title=Pakistani Flooding Impacts Fight Against Militants|date=4 September 2010|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shiite Conference, Balochistan'' announced a 40-day mourning period in line with Shia custom.&lt;ref name="zinhua"/&gt;

UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]]'s spokesman said "These attacks, which deliberately targeted Shiite Muslims and killed or injured scores of civilians, are unacceptable."&lt;ref name="UN20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=35821&amp;Cr=pakistan&amp;Cr1=|title=UN chief deplores deadly attacks against Pakistan’s Shiite Muslims|date=3 September 2010|publisher=UN News Centre|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condemning the attacks the [[White House]] stated "To target innocent civilians during the Muslim holy month of [[Ramadan]] at an already difficult time as the country is working hard to recover from [[2010 Pakistan floods|terrible flooding]] caused by monsoons makes these acts even more reprehensible."&lt;ref name="afp20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hWrPLE_lAq_hxdByLfIiuCYPQemw|title=US condemns 'reprehensible' Pakistan bombings|date=3 September 2010|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{good article}}
[[File:Springbok pronk.jpg|thumb|"Behaviour with a purpose": a young [[springbok]] [[stotting]].&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Caro&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347286800525 | title=The functions of stotting in Thomson’s gazelles: Some tests of the predictions | author=Caro, TM |authorlink=Tim Caro | journal=Animal Behaviour | year=1986 | volume=34 | pages=663–684 | doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(86)80052-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biologist might argue that this has the [[function (biology)|function]] of [[signalling theory|signalling to predators]], helping the springbok to survive and allowing it to reproduce.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;]]

'''Teleology in biology''' is the use of the language of goal-directedness in accounts of [[evolution]]ary [[adaptation]], which some [[biology|biologists]] and [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] find problematic. The term [[teleonomy]] has also been proposed. Before [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], organisms were seen as existing because God had [[creationism|designed and created]] them; their features such as eyes were taken by [[natural theology]] to have been made to enable them to carry out their [[function (biology)|functions]], such as seeing. [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologists]] often use similar teleological formulations that invoke purpose, but these imply [[natural selection]] rather than actual goals, whether conscious or not. Dissenting biologists and religious thinkers held that evolution itself was somehow goal-directed ([[orthogenesis]]), and in [[Vitalism|vitalist]] versions, driven by a purposeful life force. Since such views are now discredited, with evolution working by [[natural selection]] acting on inherited variation, the use of teleology in biology has attracted criticism, and attempts have been made to teach students to avoid teleological language.

Nevertheless, biologists still often write about evolution as if organisms had goals, and some [[philosophy of biology|philosophers of biology]] such as [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]] and biologists such as [[J. B. S. Haldane]] consider that teleological language is unavoidable in [[evolutionary biology]].

==Context==
===Teleology===
{{main|Teleology}}

[[Teleology]], from  [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:τέλος|τέλος]], ''telos'' "end, purpose"&lt;ref&gt;Eric Partridge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xA9dxrhfa5kC&amp;dq= ''Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English''], Routledge, 1977, p. 4187.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]], ''logia'', "a branch of learning", was coined by the philosopher [[Christian von Wolff]] in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wolff, Christian von |author-link1=Christian Wolff (philosopher)| date=1732 | title=Philosophia Rationalis Sive Logica: Methodo Scientifica Pertractata Et Ad Usum Scientiarum Atque Vitae Aptata |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQg_AAAAcAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept derives from the ancient Greek philosophy of [[Aristotle]], where the [[final cause]] (the purpose) of a thing is its [[function (biology)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Presuppositions of Aristotle's Politics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-politics/supplement2.html |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Aristotle's biology]] does not envisage [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leroi, Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=272–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrases used by biologists like "a function of&amp;nbsp;... is to&amp;nbsp;..." or "is designed for" are teleological at least in language. The presence of real or apparent teleology in explanations of natural selection is a controversial aspect of the [[philosophy of biology]], not least for its echoes of natural theology.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Futuyma&gt;{{cite book |author=Futuyma, Douglas J. |authorlink=Douglas J. Futuyma |title=Evolutionary Biology |date=1998 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=341, 342 |isbn=978-0-87893-189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Ray from NPG.jpg|thumb|upright|The English [[natural theology|natural theologian]] [[John Ray]], and later [[William Derham]], used teleological arguments to illustrate the glory of God from nature.&lt;ref name=Armstrong2000/&gt;]]

===Natural theology===
{{main|Natural theology}}

Before Darwin, [[natural theology]] both assumed the existence of God and used the appearance of function in nature to argue for the existence of God.&lt;ref name=Ayala/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt; The English [[parson-naturalist]] [[John Ray]] stated that his intention was "to illustrate the glory of God in the knowledge of the works of nature or creation".&lt;ref name=Armstrong2000&gt;{{cite book | title=The English Parson-Naturalist | publisher=Gracewing | author=Armstrong, Patrick | year=2000 | page=46 | isbn=0-85244-516-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural theology presented forms of the [[teleological argument]] or argument from design, namely that organs functioned well for their apparent purpose, so they were well-designed, so they must have been designed by a benevolent creator. For example, the eye had the function of seeing, and contained features like the [[iris (eye)|iris]] and [[lens (eye)|lens]] that assisted with seeing; therefore, ran the argument, it had been designed for that purpose.&lt;ref name=Ayala&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ayala, Francisco J. |authorlink=Francisco J.

===Goal-directed evolution===
{{main|Orthogenesis|Vitalism}}

Religious thinkers and biologists have repeatedly supposed that evolution was driven by some kind of life force, a philosophy known as [[vitalism]], and have often supposed that it had some kind of goal or direction (towards which the life force was striving, if they also believed in that), known as [[orthogenesis]] or evolutionary progress. Such goal-directedness implies a long-term teleological force; some supporters of orthogenesis considered it to be a spiritual force, while others held that it was purely biological. For example, the Russian [[embryologist]] [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] believed in a teleological force in nature,&lt;ref&gt;Barbieri, Marcello. (2013). ''Biosemiotics: Information, Codes and Signs in Living Systems''. Nova Science Publishers. p. 7. {{ISBN|978-1-60021-612-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, Eric Paul. (2005). ''From Cosmology to Ecology: The Monist World-view in Germany from 1770 to 1930''. p. 100. Peter Lang. {{ISBN|978-0-8204-7231-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the French [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualist philosopher]] [[Henri Bergson]] linked orthogenesis with [[vitalism]], arguing for a creative force in evolution known as ''[[élan vital]]'' in his book ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' (1907).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler|Bowler, Peter J]]. (1992). ''The Eclipse of Darwinism: Anti-Darwinian Evolution Theories in the Decades around 1900''. The Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 116–117. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-4391-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French [[biophysicist]] [[Pierre Lecomte du Noüy]] and the American botanist [[Edmund Ware Sinnott]] developed vitalist evolutionary philosophies known as ''[[telefinalism]]'' and ''[[telism]]'' respectively. Their views were heavily criticized as non-scientific;&lt;ref name="Koch 1957"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koch | first1 = Leo Francis | year = 1957 | title = Vitalistic-Mechanistic Controversy | url = | journal = [[The Scientific Monthly]] | volume = 85 | issue = 5| pages = 245–255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[palaeontologist]] [[George Gaylord Simpson]] argued that Du Noüy and Sinnott were promoting religious versions of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, George Gaylord. (1964). ''Evolutionary Theology: The New Mysticism''. In ''This View of Life: The World of an Evolutionist''. Harcourt, Brace &amp; World. pp. 213–233&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jesuit]] [[paleontologist]] [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] argued that evolution was aiming for a supposed spiritual "[[Omega Point]]" in what he called "directed additivity".&lt;ref name="Lane 1996"&gt;Lane, David H. (1996). ''The Phenomenon of Teilhard: Prophet for a New Age''. Mercer University Press. pp. 60–64. {{ISBN|0-86554-498-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Chardin, Pierre Teilhard. (2003, reprint edition). ''The Human Phenomenon''. Sussex Academic Press. p. 65. {{ISBN|1-902210-30-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]], in which the [[genetics|genetic]] mechanisms of evolution were discovered, the hypothesis of orthogenesis was largely abandoned by biologists,&lt;ref&gt;Levinton, Jeffrey S. (2001). ''Genetics, Paleontology, and Macroevolution''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 14–16. {{ISBN|0-521-80317-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, Georgina M; Largent, Mark A. (2015). ''A Companion to the History of American Science''. Wiley. p. 218. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-5625-7}} "With the integration of Mendelian genetics and population genetics into evolutionary theory in the 1930s a new generation of biologists applied mathematical techniques to investigate how changes in the frequency of genes in populations combined with natural selection could produce species change. This demonstrated that Darwinian natural selection was the primary mechanism for evolution and that other models of evolution, such as neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis, were invalid."&lt;/ref&gt; especially with [[Ronald Fisher]]'s argument in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]] by [[Stephen Jay Gould]], Chapter 7, section "Synthesis as Restriction"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sinornithosaurus IVPP V12811.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--aspect for low image--&gt;|Feathers today serve the function of [[bird flight|flight]], but they were co-opted rather than [[adaptation|adapted]] for this task, having evolved for an earlier purpose in [[theropods]] like ''[[Sinornithosaurus|Sinornithosaurus millenii]]'', perhaps [[Thermal insulation|insulation]].]]
{{main|Adaptation|Function (biology)}}

A trait which persists in a population is often assumed by biologists to have been selected for in the course of evolution, raising the question of how the trait achieves this. Biologists call any such mechanism the function of the trait, using phrases like "A [[Function (biology)|function]] of [[stotting]] by antelopes is to [[signalling theory|communicate to predators]] that they have been detected",&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web |title=Teleological Notions in Biology |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleology-biology/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=28 July 2016 |date=18 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "The [[primate]] [[hand]] is designed (by natural selection) for grasping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primates - marmosets, monkeys, apes, lemurs, humans|url=http://www.nhptv.org/wild/primates.asp |publisher=NHPTV |accessdate=28 July 2016 |quote=The hands and feet of all primates, except for humans, are designed for grasping. Humans have hands designed for grasping, but not feet! Humans have opposable thumbs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[adaptation]] is an observable structure or other feature of an organism (for example, an [[enzyme]]) generated by natural selection to serve its current function. A biologist might propose the [[hypothesis]] that [[feather]]s are adaptations for [[bird flight]]. That would require three things: that the trait of having feathers is heritable; that the trait does serve the function of flight; and that the trait increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the organisms that have it. Feathers clearly meet these three conditions in living [[birds]]. However, there is also a historical question, namely, did the trait arise at the same time as bird flight? Unfortunately for the hypothesis, this seems not to be so: [[theropod]] [[feathered dinosaur|dinosaurs had feathers]], but many of them did not fly.&lt;ref name=Berkeley&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Evolution: Qualifying as an adaptation |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/side_0_0/qualifying_01 |publisher=University of California at Berkeley |accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brusatte, Stephen L.|author2=Lloyd, Graeme T.|author3=Wang, Steve C.|author4=Norell, Mark A. |year=2014 |title=Gradual assembly of avian body plan culminated in rapid rates of evolution across the dinosaur-bird transition |journal=Current Biology |volume=24 |issue=20 |pages=2386–2392  |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.08.034 |pmid=25264248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feathers can be described as an [[exaptation]], having been co-opted for flight but having evolved earlier for another purpose such as [[Thermal insulation|insulation]].

==Status in evolutionary biology==

===Reasons for discomfort===

Apparent teleology is a recurring issue in [[evolutionary biology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Ruse, Michael |editor1link=Michael Ruse |editor2=Travis, J. |date=2009 |title=Evolution: The First Four Billion Years |publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; much to the consternation of some writers,&lt;ref name="Hanke2004"/&gt; and as an explanatory style it remains controversial.&lt;ref name="Hanke2004"&gt;{{cite book |year=2004 |author=Hanke, David |title=Teleology: The explanation that bedevils biology |pages=143–155 |work=Explanations: Styles of explanation in science |editor=Cornwell, John |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860778-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWpq14vS7WQC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=%22biology+is+sick+%22&amp;q=%22biology%20is%20sick%20%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various reasons for discomfort with teleology among biologists.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ribeiro |first1=Manuel Gustavo Leitao|display-authors=etal|title=On the debate about teleology in biology: the notion of "teleological obstacle"|journal=História, Ciências, Saúde-Manguinhos |date=2015 |volume=22 |issue=4 |doi=10.1590/S0104-59702015005000003 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0104-59702015000401321 |pages=1321–1333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstly, the concept of adaptation is itself controversial, as it can be taken to imply, as the evolutionary biologists [[Stephen J. Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] argued, that biologists agree with [[Voltaire]]'s [[Doctor Pangloss]] in his 1759 satire ''[[Candide]]'' that this is "the best of all possible worlds", in other words that every trait is perfectly suited to its functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gould, Stephen J. |author1link=Stephen J. Gould |author2=Lewontin, Richard |author2link=Richard Lewontin |date=1979 |title=The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian paradigm:  a critique of the adaptationist programme |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B |issue=205 |pages=581–598 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0086}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all that evolutionary biology requires is the weaker claim that one trait is at least slightly better in a certain context than another, and hence is selected for.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

[[File:Louis George Meistergraveurin 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Watchmaker analogy]] argues that the presence of a complex mechanism like a watch implies the existence of a conscious designer.]]

Secondly, teleology is linked to the pre-Darwinian idea of [[natural theology]], that the natural world gives evidence of the [[intelligent design|conscious design]] and beneficent intentions of a creator, as in the writings of John Ray.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;  [[William Derham]] continued Ray's tradition with books such as his 1713 ''Physico-Theology'' and his 1714 ''Astro-Theology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Weber, A. S. |title=Nineteenth-Century Science: An Anthology |publisher=Broadview Press |date=2000 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They in turn influenced [[William Paley]] who wrote a detailed [[teleological argument]] for God in 1802, ''[[Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the Appearances of Nature]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paley |first=William |authorlink=William Paley |title=Natural Theology |date=2006 |origyear=1802 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |url=https://www.academia.edu/1112017/William_Paleys_Natural_Theology_2006_Reprinted_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting with the [[Watchmaker analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Eddy, Matthew Daniel |title=Nineteenth Century Natural Theology | journal=The Oxford Handbook of Natural Theology | date=2013 | url=https://www.academia.edu/1112017/William_Paleys_Natural_Theology_2006_Reprinted_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[creationism]], along with a vitalist life-force and directed orthogenetic evolution, has been rejected by most biologists.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

Thirdly, attributing purposes to adaptations risks confusion with popular forms of [[Lamarckism]] where animals in particular have been supposed to influence their own evolution through their intentions, though Lamarck himself spoke rather of habits of use, and the belief that his thinking was teleological has been challenged.&lt;ref name=Mayr1992/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burkhardt2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burkhardt |first1=Richard W. |title=Lamarck, Evolution, and the Inheritance of Acquired Characters |journal=Genetics |volume=194 |issue=4 |year=2013 |pages=793–805 |doi=10.1534/genetics.113.151852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bednarczyk 2009 pp. 31–98"&gt;{{cite | last=Bednarczyk | first=A | title=&amp;#91;Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (1744-1829). A dispute on the mechanism of evolution. On the bicentenary of the publication of Philosophie Zoologique (1809)&amp;#93;. | journal=Kwartalnik historii nauki i techniki : Kwartal'nyi zhurnal istorii nauki i tekhniki - | volume=54 | issue=3-4 | year=2009 | issn=0023-589X | pmid=20481104 | language=pl | pages=31–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourthly, the teleological explanation of adaptation is uncomfortable because it seems to require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; because it seems to attribute the action of a conscious mind when none is assumed to be present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test [[Empirical evidence|empirically]].&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

A fifth reason concerns students rather than researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that since people naturally imagine that evolution has a purpose or direction, then the use of teleological language by scientists may act as an obstacle to students when [[Teaching evolution|learning about natural selection]]. Such language, he argues, should be removed to make teaching more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gonzalez Galli |first1=Leonardo Martin |last2=Meinardi |first2=Elsa N. |title=The Role of Teleological Thinking in Learning the Darwinian Model of Evolution |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |date=March 2011 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=145–152 |doi=10.1007/s12052-010-0272-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removable teleological shorthand===

Statements which imply that nature has goals, for example where a species is said to do something "in order to" achieve survival, appear teleological, and therefore invalid to evolutionary biologists. It is however usually possible to rewrite such sentences to avoid the apparent teleology. Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences so that they do not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology, even though that is not their intention.&lt;ref name=Reiss&gt;{{cite book |author=Reiss, John O. |date=2009 |title=Not by Design: Retiring Darwin's Watchmaker |publisher=University of California Press |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Reiss argues that evolutionary biology can be purged of apparent teleology by rejecting the pre-Darwinian watchmaker analogy for natural selection;&lt;ref name=Reiss/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Depew |first1=David J. |title=Is Evolutionary Biology Infected with Invalid Teleological Reasoning?

Some philosophers of biology such as [[James G. Lennox]] have argued that Darwin was a teleologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=James G. Lennox |author=Lennox, James G. |date=1993 |title=Darwin was a Teleologist |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=409–421 |doi=10.1007/bf00857687}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others like [[Michael Ghiselin]] described this claim as a myth promoted by misinterpretations of his discussions, and emphasized the distinction between using teleological metaphors and actually being teleological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF00850377 | last1=Ghiselin | first1=Michael T. | year=1994 | title=Darwin's language may seem teleological, but his thinking is another matter | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l1324662n645244w/| journal=Biology and Philosophy | volume=9 | issue=4 | pages=489–492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Askland, from the [[Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law]] claims that unlike [[transhumanism]], an ideology that aims to improve the [[human condition]], which he asserts is "wholly teleological", Darwinian evolution is not teleological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://web.law.asu.edu/Portals/31/Askland_transhumanism_IJETS.pdf |author=Askland, Andrew |title=The Misnomer of Transhumanism as Directed Evolution |journal=International Journal of Emerging Technologies and Society |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=2011 |pages=71–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various commentators view the teleological phrases used in modern evolutionary biology as a type of [[shorthand]] for describing any function which offers an evolutionary advantage through natural selection. For example, the zoologist S. H. P. Madrell wrote that "the proper but cumbersome way of describing change by evolutionary adaptation [may be] substituted by shorter overtly teleological statements" for the sake of saving space, but that this "should not be taken to imply that evolution proceeds by anything other than from mutations arising by chance, with those that impart an advantage being retained by natural selection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Madrell, S.H.P. |date=1998 |title=Why are there no insects in the open sea? |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=201 |pages=2461–2464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irreducible teleology===

Other philosophers of biology argue instead that biological teleology is irreducible, and cannot be removed by any simple process of rewording. [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]] argued that all statements about processes can be trivially translated into teleological statements, and vice versa, but that teleological statements are more explanatory and cannot be disposed of.&lt;ref name=Ayala1977&gt;{{cite book |author=Ayala, Francisco J. |authorlink=Francisco J. Ayala |date=1977 |title=Teleological explanations |editor=Dobzhansky, T. |editorlink=Theodosius Dobzhansky |work=Evolution |publisher=W.H. Freeman |pages=497–504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayala 1998"&gt;[[Francisco J. Ayala|Ayala, Francisco]] (1998). "Teleological explanations in evolutionary biology." ''Nature's purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Neander similarly argued that the modern concept of [[function (biology)|biological 'function']] depends on [[natural selection]]. So, for example, it is not possible to say that anything that simply winks into existence, without going through a process of selection, actually has functions. We decide whether an [[appendage]] has a function by analysing the process of selection that led to it. Therefore, Neander argues, any talk of functions must be posterior to natural selection, function must be defined by reference to the history of a species, and teleology cannot be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Neander, Karen (1998). "Functions as Selected Effects: The Conceptual Analyst's Defense," in C. Allen, M. Bekoff &amp; G. Lauder (Eds.), ''Nature's Purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology'' (pp. 313–333). The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] likewise stated that "adaptedness&amp;nbsp;... is an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' result rather than an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' goal-seeking."&lt;ref name=Mayr1992&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |author=Mayr, Ernst W. |date=1992 |title=The idea of teleology |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=53 |pages=117–135 |doi=10.2307/2709913|jstor=2709913 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angela Breitenbach, looking at the question of teleology in biology from a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] perspective, argues that teleology is important as "a [[heuristic]] in the search for causal explanations of nature and&amp;nbsp;... an inevitable [[analogy|analogical]] perspective on living beings." In her view of Kant, teleology implies something that cannot be explained by science, but only understood through analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Breitenbach |first1=Angela |title=Teleology in Biology : A Kantian Perspective |date=2009 |pages=31–56 |url=http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/people/teaching-research-pages/breitenbach/breitenbach-teleologybiology.pdf |journal=Kant Yearbook |volume=2009 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Pittendrigh]] coined the similar term '[[teleonomy]]' for apparently goal-directed biological phenomena.&lt;ref name=Pittendrigh&gt;{{cite book |author=Pittendrigh, Colin S. |authorlink=Colin Pittendrigh |title="Adaptation, natural selection, and behavior" |work=Behavior and Evolution |editor1=Roe, A.|editor2=Simpson, George Gaylord |editor2-link=George Gaylord Simpson|location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |date=1958 |pages=390–416}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Mayr]] criticised Pittendrigh's confusion of Aristotle's [[four causes]], arguing that evolution only involved the material and formal but not the efficient cause.{{efn|Both Pittendrigh and Mayr endorsed teleology in biology as an inherent part of evolutionary thinking.&lt;ref name=Pittendrigh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayr/&gt;}} Mayr proposed to use the term only for "systems operating on the basis of a program of coded information."&lt;ref name=Mayr&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |chapter=Cause and effect in biology |editor=Lerner, D. |title=Cause and effect |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |date=1965 |pages=33–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William C. Wimsatt]] affirmed that the teleologicality of the language of biology and other fields derives from the logical structure of their background theories, and not merely from the use of teleological locutions such as "function" and "in order to". He stated that "To replace talk about function by talk about selection [...] is not to eliminate teleology but to rephrase it". However, Wimsatt argues that this thought does not mean an appeal to [[backwards causation]], [[vitalism]], [[entelechy]], or [[Antireductionism|anti-reductionist]] sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wimsatt, W. |authorlink=William C. Wimsatt |year=1972 |title=Teleology and the logical structure of function statements |journal=Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science |volume=3 |pages=1–80 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0039368172900143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] observed that "Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he's unwilling to be seen with her in public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hull, D. |title=Philosophy of Biological Science |publisher=Prentice-Hall |date=1973 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst]] (1974) Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Volume XIV, pages 91–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teresita Fernández''' (born May 12, 1968) is a visual artist best known for her prominent public sculptures and unconventional use of materials. Fernández's work is characterized by an interest in perception and the psychology of looking. Her experiential, large-scale works are often inspired by landscape and natural phenomena as well as diverse historical and cultural references.&lt;ref name=ArchitecturalDigest-AsAboveSoBelow-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slenske|first1=Michael|title=Teresita Fernández Artworks at Lehman Maupin, Hong Kong, and Mass MoCA|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/teresita-fernandez-brooklyn-artist-installations|work=[[Architectural Digest]]|date=30 September 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist's work has explored issues in contemporary art related to perception and the fabrication of the natural world. Often her sculptures present spectacular optical illusions and evoke natural phenomena, land formations, and water in its infinite forms.&lt;ref name=BrooklynRail-AsAboveSoBelow-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roffino|first1=Sara|title=Teresita Fernández with Sara Roffino|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2014/07/art/teresita-fernndez-with-sara-roffino|work=[[The Brooklyn Rail]]|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Fernández was born in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], to Cuban parents in exile. Her family fled [[Fidel Castro]]'s regime in July 1959, six months after the [[Cuban Revolution]]. As a child, she spent much of her time making things in the atelier of her great aunts and grandmother, all whom had been trained as highly skilled couture seamstresses in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=Vogue-NuevoNewYork-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garcia|first1=Patricia|title=Can Someone Mail a Copy of Nuevo New York to Donald Trump?|url=http://www.vogue.com/article/nuevo-new-york-book-latino-culture|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=23 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Fernández graduated from [[Southwest Miami High School]]. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from [[Florida International University]] in 1990, and a Masters of Fine Art from [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in 1992.

== Career ==
In 1996, Fernández had her first solo exhibition in New York at [[Deitch Projects]], where she transformed the gallery into an empty, indoor swimming pool that was in part inspired by a house designed for [[Josephine Baker]] in 1920's Paris. The following year she was included in an exhibition at [[New Museum]] and in a group show titled "The Crystal Stopper" at [[Lehmann Maupin]] curated by [[Carlos Basualdo]]. Her first solo museum show was at the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia]] in 1999. Soon after that she had solo exhibitions at [[Site Santa Fe]], [[Castello di Rivoli]], and The Centro de Arte Contemporaneo, in [[Málaga]], Spain.

In 2000, Fernández's site-specific project titled "Hothouse" was installed at [[The Museum of Modern Art]]. The work was commissioned as part of "Open Ends," the third and final cycle of "MoMA2000," on view September 28, 2000 through January 2, 2001. The installation, a sprawling vine-like pattern (white on the front and green on the back), meandered across the glass looking out to [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden]].

The [[Public Art Fund]] commissioned Fernández's "Bamboo Cinema" (2001) in New York's [[Madison Square Park]]. The sculpture, a maze-like form made of concentric circles that functioned like an early cinematic device, was made of translucent elements that optically shifted the surroundings like an animated filmstrip. The vertical elements of the sculpture were made of extruded polycarbonate tubes of different diameters that had a green-hued stripe pattern embedded into them. The transparent tubes allowed different degrees of visibility from every angle. As in the earliest examples of cinematic devices, the vertical lines acted as a continuous shutter, constantly interrupting any movement so that it appeared to flicker.

In 2005, she created a piece called "Fire" during her residency at [[The Fabric Workshop and Museum]] that was constructed using thousands of silk threads from [[Franco Scalamandré]]. The dyed silk threads were held taut between two rings and suspended from the ceiling, creating a unique optical illusion of transparency and dense color that appeared to vibrate when experienced by the moving viewer.

In 2006, at the age thirty-five, she became the youngest artist commissioned by the [[Seattle Art Museum]] for the museum's [[Olympic Sculpture Park]]. Her permanently installed work, "[[Seattle Cloud Cover]]" (2006), allows visitors to walk under a block-long covered skyway while viewing the city's skyline appearing through tiny holes in color-saturated glass.

Fernández has made many sculptures out of raw, mined graphite as a way of looking at the intersection between drawing, land art and landscape painting. Her sculpture "Borrowdale (Drawn Waters)" (2009) is a reference to [[Cumbria]], England, the location where graphite was first discovered and mined in the 1500s.

{{quote|1=You can rephrase blindness in terms of the varieties of not-seeing:shadows, darkness, inaccessibility, denial, cloaking, peeking, squinting, hiding, camouflaging. These, too, are degrees of blindness, though less specific to the physicality of the eye and more inextricably linked to thinking, dreaming, and imagining. In my new "Nocturnal" series, I am in fact trying to amplify seeing by dimming it.&lt;ref name=BlindLandscape-USF-Blanton-2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Margaret|last2=Stringfield|first2=Anne|last3=Hickey|first3=Dave|last4=Norr|first4=David Louis|last5=Volk|first5=Gregory|last6=DiMeo Carlozzi|first6=Annette|editor1-last=Norr|editor1-first=David Louis|title=Teresita Fernández: Blind Landscape|date=2009|publisher=JRP Ringier|location=Zurich|isbn=978-3-037-64049-4|format=Exhibition catalog|oclc=466657380}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fernández's "Blind Blue Landscape" (2009) at the renowned Bennesee Art Site in [[Naoshima, Kagawa]] consists of over thirty thousand hand-made mirrored glass cubes installed on a curved wall in the Tadao Ando designed building. Each mirror becomes like a miniature portrait reflecting the dramatic landscape of the [[Seto Inland Sea]] outside.

In 2009, the [[Blanton Museum of Art]], commissioned the large permanent work titled "Stacked Waters" that occupies the museum's Rapoport Atrium. "Stacked Waters" consists of 3,100 square feet of custom-cast acrylic that covers the walls in a striped pattern. The work's title alludes to artist [[Donald Judd]]'s "stack" sculptures—series of identical boxes installed vertically along wall surfaces—as well as to his sculptural explorations of box interiors. Fernández noticed how The Blanton's atrium functions like a box, and given its architectural nods to the arches of Roman baths and cisterns, she sought to fill its spatial volume with an illusion of water.&lt;ref name=Blanton-StackedWaters-Vid-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernández|first1=Teresita|title=Teresita Fernández, Stacked Waters|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2veik-avFNw|work=[[Blanton Museum of Art]]|date=11 August 2011|format=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanton-StackedWaters-2009&gt;{{cite news|title=Teresita Fernández: Stacked Waters – Austin's Blanton Museum of Art|url=http://blantonmuseum.org/collection/teresita-fernandez-stacked-waters/|work=[[Blanton Museum of Art]]|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2009, Fernández had a piece called "Starfield" made up of mirrored glass cubes on anodized aluminum in the [[AT&amp;T Stadium]] in Arlington, Texas.&lt;ref name=CowboysStadiumArt-2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheek|first1=Lawrence W.|last2=Daniels|first2=Brett|last3=Pagel|first3=David|title=Dallas Cowboys Art Collection: Art + Architecture at AT&amp;T Stadium|date=2010|location=Arlington, TX|page=23|url=https://attstadium.com/sites/default/files/dc-content-files/ArtBook.pdf|oclc=657077503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Fernández installed a show at Lehmann Maupin [[Chrystie Street]] titled "Night Writing," which consisted of an installation and a series of large works on paper created at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute. The work explored the idea of how humans have always looked up at the night sky for information, guidance, navigation and time-keeping. The title of the piece comes from an early form of [[braille]] which Fernández used to translate text that became a constellation pattern of perforated holes backed by mirrors – making the work a dynamic, reflective surface.

Fernández's largest solo exhibition to date, "As Above So Below" was recently on view at [[MASS MoCA]] in [[North Adams, Massachusetts]]. Describing a universe in balance, the phrase "as above, so below" originates from the [[Vedas]] and is an idea central to ancient alchemy, in which every action occurring on one level of reality (physical, emotional, or mental) correlates to every other. Fernández applied this concept to scale, suggesting that the vast is present in the tiny and vice versa, a kind of "intimate immensity". Responding to MASS MoCA's massive and light-filled first-floor galleries, Fernández created landscape-like large-scale installations alongside palm-sized sculptures that embodied this expression. The show featured exploration of two-mined, subterranean minerals, gold and graphite, to depict cosmic and light-filled images that refer to the heavens, thus suggesting both the space above and below the viewer.

In 2013, Fernández was featured in a contemporary art installation in the [http://www.thealfondinn.com/about/art_at_the_inn/ Alfond Inn] in [[Winter Park, FL]], as a part of the [[Cornell Fine Arts Museum]]. The work on display is titled "Nocturnal (Cobalt Panorama), c. 2012."&lt;ref name=ArtForRollins-CornellFineArtsMuseum-2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CubanArtNews-Nocturnal-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=DiazCasas|first1=Rafael|title=Close-Up: Nocturnal (Navigation) by Teresita Fernández|url=http://www.cubanartnews.org/news/close-up-nocturnal-navigation-by-teresita-fernandez/3037|work=Cuban Art News|date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2015, "Fata Morgana" opened in New York's [[Madison Square Park]]. The [[Madison Square Park Conservancy]] presented the outdoor sculpture consisting of 500 running feet of golden, mirror-polished discs that create canopies above the pathways around the park's central Oval Lawn.&lt;ref name=WSJ-FataMorgana-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kino|first1=Carol|title=Artist Teresita Fernández Transforms New York's Madison Square Park|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/artist-teresita-fernandez-transforms-new-yorks-madison-square-park-1427814775|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|1=In "Fata Morgana" I wanted to invert the traditional notion of outdoor sculpture by addressing all of the active walkways of the park to create an experiential, ambulatory art experience. By hovering over the park in a horizontal canopy, "Fata Morgana" becomes a ghost-like, sculptural, luminous mirage that distorts the landscape and becomes a reflective portrait of urban activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/things-to-do/calendar/mad-sq-art-teresita-fernandez Things to Do: Mad. Sq. Art: Teresita Fernández]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2017, Fernández, in collaboration with [[Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros]], created a site-specific installation called "OVERLOOK: Teresita Fernández confronts Frederic Church at Olana" at [[Olana State Historic Site]].&lt;ref name=Olana-OVERLOOK-2017&gt;{{cite web|title=OVERLOOK: Teresita Fernández confronts Frederic Church at Olana A collaboration with the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros|url=http://www.olana.org/overlook/|website=Olana NY State Historic Site|date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Olana-OVERLOOK-PressRelease-2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hasbrook|first1=Melanie|last2=Barrera Pieck|first2=Mariana|title="OVERLOOK" Exhibition at Olana Features a Groundbreaking Site-Specific Installation by Artist Teresita Fernández|url=http://www.olana.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/OVERLOOK-Exhibition-at-Olana-FINAL.pdf|format=Press release|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the work, Fernández juxtaposes the works of landscape artists like [[Frederic Church]], [[Marianne North]], [[Martin Johnson Heade]], among others, with images of indigenous people and their fellow travellers in order to examine and illustrate the context of the world that made up their images.&lt;ref name=ArtNewspaper-OUTLOOK-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Halperin|first1=Julia|title=Teresita Fernandez wants to change the way you think about American landscapes|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/teresita-fernandez-wants-to-change-the-way-you-think-about-american-landscapes/|work=[[The Art Newspaper]]|date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and medium ==
At the core of Teresita Fernández's work is a paradox: she captures the essence of formless elements such as fire, water, and air using undeniably physical materials.&lt;ref name=ArtForRollins-CornellFineArtsMuseum-2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawrence Alfond|first1=Barbara|last2=Ross Goodman|first2=Abigail|last3=Heller|first3=Ena|editor1-last=Ross Goodman|editor1-first=Abigail|title=Art for Rollins: The Alfond Collection of Contemporary Art. Volume I|date=2013|publisher=Cornell Fine Arts Museum|location=Winter Park, FL|isbn=978-0-979-22802-5|format=Exhibition catalog|oclc=903361166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teresita Fernández is an artist well known for large-scale public sculptures and installations made from such diverse materials as thread, aluminum, acrylic, plastic, and glass beads. Although these are industrial materials, Fernández transforms them into forms and shapes that suggest natural phenomena such as waterfalls or sand dunes. This places her along a lineage of artist who explore the relationship between the power of nature and the development of technology.&lt;ref name=ArtForRollins-CornellFineArtsMuseum-2013 /&gt;

In her sculptures and drawings, Fernández often leverages non-traditional media to create optical illusions of motion, dissolution, and illumination. Fernández pairing of a conventional subject with an unconventional material reinforces her interest in combining the natural with the industrial or mass-produced.&lt;ref name=ArtForRollins-CornellFineArtsMuseum-2013 /&gt;

== Japanese influences ==
In 1997, Fernández lived in [[Moriya, Ibaraki]], during an artist's residency with [[Arcus Project]]. Fernández cites Japanese culture and sensibility as the greatest inspiration to her work as an artist.&lt;ref name=BrooklynRail-AsAboveSoBelow-2014 /&gt; Fernández states,

{{quote|1=I think a huge part of me must be from Japan and it plays into my work, [particularly with] light and dark. [Like] light and shadows [or] seeing and not seeing. In fact most of my work [is what] that's all about – the idea that darkness, the revered beauty of shadows, is not really "just" dark emptiness, but that darkness is actually very much alive, dynamic. So it's about that reciprocity where darkness only exists where there's light and light only exists where there's darkness—they exist in tandem with one another, they define one another much more than being distant opposites.&lt;ref name=BrooklynRail-AsAboveSoBelow-2014 /&gt;}}

Fernández continues to visit [[Japan]] regularly during the last 18 years and cites her ongoing relationship with Japan as having a significant impact on her and her artwork:

{{quote|1=There is something very particular in Japan that I recognized as oddly familiar and important. For me, the presence that inanimate objects have there is very similar to what art does. As a sculptor, it's very hard to make ordinary, physical materials that very much just want to be what they are, transcend themselves and have a charged presence that affects viewers on a visceral level.&lt;ref name=BrooklynRail-AsAboveSoBelow-2014 /&gt;}}

== Recognition ==
In 2007, established curator [[Lisa Corrin]] of [[Northwestern University]] called Fernández "one of the best-kept secrets in the contemporary-art world."&lt;ref name=Vogue-Profile-2007&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stringfield|first1=Anne|title=People Are Talking About: Art. The Dazzle: Teresita Fernández makes art that is structurally elegant, thoughtfully compelling, and absolutely luminous|url=http://images.exhibit-e.com/www_lehmannmaupin_com/b719931f.pdf|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=April 2007|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[President Obama]] appointed Fernández to the serve on the [[U.S. Commission of Fine Arts]], a federal panel that advises the President, Congress, and governmental agencies on national matters of design and aesthetics. She is the first Latina to serve on the Commission, and the second person of Latino heritage to serve on the CFA in its over 100-year history. Forty years before her appointment, the last Cuban Ambassador to the United States [[Nicolas Arroyo]] sat on the panel from 1971 to 1976.

In May 2013, Fernández gave the keynote commencement speech at her alma mater, [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]. Fernández's address was called "On Amnesia, Broken Pottery, and the Inside of a Form." to the graduating class at her alma mater, [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]'s School of the Arts, was cited by [[Maria Popova]]'s blog [[Brain Pickings]] as one of the greatest commencement addresses of all time.

Fernández's speech highlighted the values of not giving up, accepting failure and change as a positive, and keeping integrity with accompanied success. Fernandez also offered ten tips for the graduates for help on the creative journey, including 1) Art requires time; 4) Not every project will survive; and 6) "When people say your work is good, do two things: first, don't believe them. Second, ask them, 'why?'"&lt;ref name=BrainPickings-BlindLandscape-2014 /&gt;
One of the more significant quotes of the keynote speech helped provide insight into Fernández's philosophy that governs her artwork:

{{quote|1=I was enamored with the idea of how what seemed broken, discarded, useless was transformed into a meaningful gesture… We are conditioned to think that what is broken is lost, or useless or a setback, and so when we set out with big ambitions we don't necessarily recognize what the next graduation is supposed to look like. Unlearning everything you learned in college is just an exercise in learning to recognize how the fragments and small bits lead to something that is much more than the sum of its parts.&lt;ref name=BrainPickings-BlindLandscape-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Popova|first1=Maria|title=What It Really Takes to Be an Artist: MacArthur Genius Teresita Fernández's Magnificent Commencement Address|url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/29/teresita-fernandez-commencement-address/|work=[[Brain Pickings]]|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fernández parting point could also be considered her most poignant – a reminder that being human is the wider circle within which being an artist resides, and that our art is always the combinatorial product of the fragments of who we are, of our combinatorial character.&lt;ref name=BrainPickings-BlindLandscape-2014 /&gt;

{{quote|1=Being an artist is not just about what happens when you are in the studio. The way you live, the people you choose to love and the way you love them, the way you vote, the words that come out of your mouth… will also become the raw material for the art you make.&lt;ref name=BrainPickings-BlindLandscape-2014 /&gt;}}

== Personal life ==
Fernández has lived and worked in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] since 1997. She has two children.&lt;ref name=Vogue-Profile-2007 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8715">The '''''Dîner des trois empereurs''''' or '''Three Emperors Dinner''' was a [[banquet]] held at [[Café Anglais (Paris)|Café Anglais]] in [[Paris]], [[France]] on 7 June 1867.&lt;ref name="Frost Laing 2016"/&gt; It consisted of 16 [[Course (food)|courses]] with eight wines served over eight hours.

==Overview==
The Three Emperors Dinner was prepared by chef [[Adolphe Dugléré]] at the request of [[William I, German Emperor|King William I of Prussia]] who frequented the cafe during the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]]. He requested a meal to be remembered and at which no expense was to be spared for himself and his guests, [[Tsar Alexander II]] of Russia, plus his son the tsarevitch (who later became [[Tsar Alexander III]]), and [[Otto von Bismarck|Prince Otto von Bismarck]]. The cellar master, Claudius Burdel, was instructed to accompany the dishes with the greatest wines in the world, including a [[Louis Roederer|Roederer champagne]] in a [[Cristal (wine)|special]] [[lead glass]] bottle, so Tsar Alexander could admire the bubbles and golden colour.&lt;ref name="hier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menus.free.fr/index_fichiers/Page2511.htm |title=Menus d'hier |publisher=Menus.free.fr |date= |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banquet consisted of 16 courses with eight wines served over eight hours. The cost of the meal was 400 francs per person&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=For epicures only|author=Jean Conil|publisher=T.W. Laurie|year=1952|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; (over [[Euro|€]]9,000 in {{CURRENTYEAR}} prices). The high price of the wines served contributed to the high price of the meal.&lt;ref name="Frost Laing 2016"/&gt;

At 1 o'clock in the morning, Tsar Alexander is reported to have complained that the meal had not contained [[foie gras]]. Burdel explained that it was not the custom in French cuisine to eat foie gras in June. &lt;!-- Was it? --&gt; The tsar was satisfied with the answer. Each emperor was sent a [[Terrine (food)|terrine]] of foie gras as a gift the following October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latourdargent.com/emblematique/le-foie-gras-des-trois-empereurs|title=Le foie gras des Trois Empereurs|publisher=La Tour d'Argent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-creation==
[[Australia]]n chef [[Shannon Bennett]] attempted to recreate the banquet in 2002. It took six months to plan and required some changes due to key ingredients and wines no longer being available. Even using the nearest modern equivalent ingredients and wines, the cost of the meal was [[Australian dollar|$]]7,500 per person. The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] broadcast the documentary ''Three Emperors Dinner'' about the original banquet and the modern recreation in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/documentaries/stories/s814454.htm|title=Three Emperors Dinner|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=4 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1944 illustration by [[Thomas C. Lea III]] of [[World War II]]: "[[Thousand-yard stare|The 2000 Yard Stare]]".]]

The use of '''war as metaphor''' is a longstanding literary and rhetorical [[Trope (literature)|trope]]. In political usage, [[war]] [[metaphor]]s are used to manage a perceived societal problem, with the concept taking the place of an individual or state enemy in true war.

[[James Childress]] describes the use of war as a metaphor as a dilemma: "In debating social policy through the language of war, we often forget the moral reality of war."&lt;ref name="jfc"/&gt; One fundamental problem is that it is often unclear when the "war" is over.&lt;ref name="sr-20160518"/&gt;

The [[Cultural Revolution]] in China 1966−1976, which initially was launched as a "War against Revisionism", is a discouraging example of a metaphorical war against "-isms".&lt;ref name="sr-20160518"/&gt;

== Examples ==
Examples of war used as a metaphor, often on the form "War on..." or "War against...":

* "[[Customs war]]", also known as a "toll war" or "tariff war", a type of economic conflict between two or more states.
* "[[Trade war]]"
* "[[War on crime|War on Crime]]", 1930s, [[J. Edgar Hoover]]
* "[[Cold War]]" (1947—1991), a period of hostility between the two dominant [[superpower]]s at the time, the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The Cold War in itself was never a war, but several [[proxy war]]s were carried out by both sides over the period.
* The [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966−1976) in China was launched as a "War against Revisionism"&lt;ref name="sr-20160518"/&gt; Marshall [[ Lin Biao]] is given credit for inspiring war metaphors when he said in 1965, at the outset of the movement, "The battlefield of the Cultural Revolution cannot call a ceasefire. This is a war without that option."&lt;ref&gt; {{citation|author=Xing Lu|title=Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: The Impact on Chinese Thought, Culture, and Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GO5HrrJC_aMC&amp;pg=PA91|date=January 2004|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-543-2|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jimmy Carter]]'s application of "war" as metaphor for the [[1973 oil crisis|energy crisis of 1974]]{{clarify|How was it used? Add a quote from the source if possible.|date=May 2016}} described in ''[[Metaphors We Live By]]'' by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson describe
* "[[War on Poverty]]", an unofficial name for legislation first introduced by United States president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] during his [[State of the Union address]] on 8 January 1964.

* "War on Terrorism" or "[[War on Terror]]" (2001−2013) coined in 2001 by then United States [[President of the United States|president]] [[George W. Bush]] after the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]] to mobilize an international military campaign. In 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] announced that the United States was no longer pursuing a War on Terror, as the military focus should be on specific enemies rather than a tactic.
