      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1270">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] subject of [[topology]], an '''ambient isotopy''', also called an ''h-isotopy'', is a kind of continuous distortion of an [[ambient space]], for example a [[manifold]], taking a [[submanifold]] to another submanifold. For example in [[knot theory]], one considers two [[knot (mathematics)|knot]]s the same if one can distort one knot into the other without breaking it. Such a distortion is an example of an ambient isotopy.  More precisely, let ''N'' and ''M'' be manifolds and ''g'' and ''h'' be [[embedding]]s of ''N'' in ''M''.  A [[continuous map]] 
:&lt;math&gt;F:M \times [0,1] \rightarrow M &lt;/math&gt; 
is defined to be an ambient isotopy taking ''g'' to ''h'' if ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[identity function|identity map]], each map ''F&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a [[homeomorphism]] from ''M'' to itself, and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''g'' = ''h''. This implies that the [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] must be preserved by ambient isotopies. For example, two knots which are [[mirror image]]s of each other are in general not equivalent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4555">The '''[[Apollo]] [[archetype]]''' personifies the aspect of the [[Personality psychology|personality]] that wants clear definitions, is drawn to master a skill, values order and harmony, and prefers to look at the surface, as opposed to beneath appearances. The Apollo archetype favors thinking over [[feeling]], distance over closeness, objective assessment over subjective [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].&lt;ref name="Shinoda-Bolen, J. 1989 p.135"&gt;Shinoda-Bolen, J., Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men’s Lives and Loves (1989) p.135 Harpur &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Layton-Shapira, L., The Cassandra Complex: Living with Disbelief, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G., 'The Apollonian and The Dionysian' p.136 in  Psychological Types, Vol 6 Collected Works, Princeton-Bollingen 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Early in the 20th century, [[Carl Gustav Jung]] sought to find a word that could describe the innate patterns of behaviour that govern our lives. Thus he introduced the term ‘[[Archetype]]s’ into modern [[psychology]]. Jung described archetypes as distinct [[wikt:theme|themes]] manifesting in the [[fantasy|fantasies]] and behaviour of his patients, and found these same themes visibly rendered in the arts, [[religion]]s, [[mythology|myths]], [[architecture]], and social customs of all peoples. Because he did not want the term ‘archetypes’ to become yet another intellectual abstraction, Jung advanced various mythic images to illustrate them. For instance, the Goddess Demeter is a presentation of the archetypal mother; Zeus an archetypal father; Apollo the archetypal intellectual, and so on. Jung went on to personify many archetypes by using general expressions such as 'The Great Mother’, 'Old Wise Man’, 'Shadow archetype’, etc. which have now become standard expressions in the field of [[Analytical Psychology]]. Jung writes “The fact that the unconscious spontaneously personifies is the reason why I have taken over these personifications in my terminology and formulated them in names”.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G., The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious Vol 9, part 1. Collected Works, Princeton-Bollingen 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
As with other archetypes, the Apollo archetype is not gender-specific.&lt;ref name="Shinoda-Bolen, J. 1989 p.135"/&gt; "Women often find that a particular [male] god exists in them as well, just as I found that when I spoke about goddesses men could identify a part of themselves with a specific goddess. Gods and goddesses represent different qualities in the human psyche. The pantheon of Greek deities together, male and female, exist as archetypes in us all… There are gods and goddesses in every person."&lt;ref&gt;Shinoda-Bolen, J., Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men’s Lives and Loves (1989) p.x-xi Harpur &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the many positive aspects of the Apollo archetype such as order, reason, moderation, harmoniousness, and unemotional perfection,&lt;ref&gt;Hillman. J., Suicide and The Soul, Spring Publications 1965. p.122-23&lt;/ref&gt; archetypal [[psychologist]] [[James Hillman]] suggests that the archetype may also manifest as a negative potential if it becomes overly dominant: "Apollo certainly presents a pattern that is disastrous, destructive for psychological life, cut off from everything that has to do with feminine ways, whether [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra]] or [[Creusa (daughter of Erechtheus)|Creusa]] or [[Daphne]] — whomever he touches goes wrong — so that you have the feeling that [[Apollo]] simply doesn't belong where there is psyche."&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, J. ''Inter-Views'', Spring Publications, 1983 p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

Of what she describes as the negative Apollonic influence, Dr. Shinoda-Bolen writes:
{{blockquote|Individuals who resemble Apollo have difficulties that are related to emotional distance, such as communication problems, and the inability to be intimate… Rapport with another person is hard for the Apollo man. He prefers to access (or judge) the situation or the person from a distance, not knowing that he must "get close up" - be vulnerable and empathic - in order to truly know someone else…. But if the woman wants a deeper, more personal relationship, then there are difficulties… she may become increasingly irrational or hysterical.&lt;ref&gt;Shinoda-Bolen, J., Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men’s Lives and Loves p.130-160 (1989)"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10536">The '''beheading of Bhausaheb Maruti Talekar''' by Pakistani soldiers and over two-dozen [[HuJI]] terrorists led by [[Ilyas Kashmiri]] happened in the [[Rajouri]] district of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[India]] on 27 February 2000. Talekar was an Indian soldier on guard duty at the Ashok Listening Post which is surrounded on three sides by Pakistani posts. His post was attacked under the cover of mortar and rocket fire from Pakistani troops in which all seven soldiers on duty from the [[Maratha Light Infantry|17 Maratha Light Infantry]] battalion were killed. Talekar was beheaded and his severed head was carried across the [[line of control]].

After the beheading of Talekar, allegations of other incidents of [[Decapitation|beheading]] by both countries have frequently been reported.

==Biography of Talekar==
Talekar was a resident of Kolgaon village in [[Ahmednagar district]], [[Maharashtra]], India. He was the son of daily laborers and had studied till the 10th grade before joining the army. He was unmarried and 24 years old at the time of his death. According to natives of his village, the family of Talekar did not knew that he was beheaded. The army declined the Talekar's sister request to see his face.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt; His last rites were performed at his village.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TIE09"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Ilyas Kashmiri===
{{main|Ilyas Kashmiri}}
Pakistani media published the photographs of Ilyas Kasmiri carrying the severed head of Talekar.&lt;ref name="TH01"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swami|first1=Praveen|title=Pakistan's Kashmiri problem|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/pakistans-kashmiri-problem/article2094016.ece|accessdate=30 September 2016|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also reported that the then president of Pakistan Gen. [[Pervez Musharraf]] honored Ilyas Kashmiri in a ceremony and rewarded his one-lakh ruppes cash for bringing the head of an Indian soldier.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Da02"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Zaigham|title=Death of a quintessential Jihadi|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/634784/death-of-a-quintessential-jihadi|accessdate=4 October 2016|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZN01"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arora|first1=Kamna|title=Ilyas Kashmiri still alive inside Pakistani troops|url=http://zeenews.india.com/blog/ilyas-kashmiri-still-alive-inside-pakistani-troops_5974.html|accessdate=1 October 2016|publisher=Zee News|date=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="N1801"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhattacharya|first1=Tathagata|title=Who is Illyas Kashmiri?|url=http://www.news18.com/news/india/who-is-illyas-kashmiri-373303.html|accessdate=6 October 2016|publisher=News18.com|date=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilyas Kashmiri, was killed in a US drone attack in 2011.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TH01"/&gt;

===The inquiry against the commanding officer===
The commanding officer of the unit was [[Colonel]] Sandes. He had communicated to the superiors seeking permission to shift the Ashok listening post because of the possibility of a sneaking attack such as the one which happened on the 27 February 2000, but he was denied permission. He faced a court of inquiry after the incident which exonerated him, but his superiors had reported that colonel Sandes was unfit for commanding a unit. The colonel had to fight a legal battle to be eligible for promotion. Sandes was promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="ToI02"/&gt;

===Talekar's memory===
The army took up the responsibility of the education of his sister after the incident. His family continues to receive a [[pension]] of {{INR}}10,000 per month. A sum of 12 lakh rupees was given to Talekar's family as compensation.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt;

In his memory, a community hall was built in his village. His sister is pursuing{{when|date=October 2016}} the hope to start a school for special children in his memory.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt;

===Similar incidents===
Since the torture and murder of [[Saurabh Kalia]] during the Kargil war in the custody of Pakistani troops; many allegations of mistreatment of soldiers by the other side have been reported from Kashmir. The beheading of Talekar happened one year after the [[Kargil war]] ended. Pakistan has filed complaints with the [[United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan]] (UNMOGIP) accusing the Indian Army of beheading at least a dozen Pakistani soldiers since 1998.&lt;ref name="Da01"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan accuses India of 12 Kashmir beheadings since 1998: report|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/782394/pakistan-accuses-india-of-12-kashmir-beheadings-report|accessdate=4 October 2016|agency=[[AFP news agency|AFP]]|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has denied these allegations.&lt;ref name="TNT01"&gt;{{cite news|title=India rejects Pak’s claim on beheading of troops|url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/india/paks-claim-on-beheading-troops-totally-baseless-says-antony/143860|accessdate=4 October 2016|publisher=[[The Navhind Times]]|date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ET02"&gt;{{cite news|title=India rejects Pakistan's claim on beheading of Troops|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/india-rejects-pakistans-claim-on-beheading-of-troops/articleshow/18270070.cms|accessdate=4 October 2016|agency=[[Press Trust of India|PTI]]|publisher=[[The Economic Times]]|date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one decade before 2013, when Lance Naik Hemraj was beheaded, there have been at least three other such instances of decapitation of Indian soldiers by the Pakistani troops.&lt;ref name="TH02"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Josephy|first1=Josy|title=Back in the day, cross-LoC hit and run was a given|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/back-in-the-day-crossloc-hit-and-run-was-a-given/article9174532.ece|accessdate=3 October 2016|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bell's theorem''' is a "[[no-go theorem]]" that draws an important distinction between [[quantum mechanics]] and the world as described by [[classical mechanics]], particularly concerning ''[[quantum entanglement]]'' where two or more particles in a ''[[quantum state]]'' continue to be mutually dependent, even at large physical separations. This theorem is named after [[John Stewart Bell]].

A series of experiments has verified the theorem and showed that quantum entanglement occurs over large distances. 
Quantum entanglement has profound implications for the outcomes of measurements of quantum systems; for example, in ''[[quantum computing]]''.

In its simplest form, Bell's theorem states:&lt;ref name="C.B. Parker 1994 542"&gt;{{cite book | author = C.B. Parker | title = McGraw-Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics | edition = 2nd | page = 542 | year=  1994 | publisher = McGraw-Hill  | isbn = 978-0-07-051400-3 }}  Bell himself wrote: "If [a hidden variable theory] is local it will not agree with quantum mechanics, and if it agrees with quantum mechanics it will not be local.  This is what the theorem says."  John Bell, ''Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics'', Cambridge University Press, 1987, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|No physical theory of [[Local hidden variable theory|local hidden variables]] can ever reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics.}}

Bell's theorem rules out [[local hidden variable]]s as a viable explanation of quantum mechanics (though it still leaves the door open for non-local hidden variables, such as [[De Broglie–Bohm theory]], etc). Bell concluded:

{{quotation|In a theory in which parameters are added to quantum mechanics to determine the results of individual measurements, without changing the statistical predictions, there must be a mechanism whereby the setting of one measuring device can influence the reading of another instrument, however remote.

Bell summarized one of the least popular ways to address the theorem, [[superdeterminism]], in a 1985 BBC Radio interview:

{{quotation|There is a way to escape the inference of [[superluminal]] speeds and spooky action at a distance. But it involves absolute [[determinism]] in the universe, the complete absence of [[free will]]. Suppose the world is super-deterministic, with not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behavior, including our belief that we are free to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined, including the 'decision' by the experimenter to carry out one set of measurements rather than another, the difficulty disappears. There is no need for a faster-than-light signal to tell particle ''A'' what measurement has been carried out on particle&amp;nbsp;''B'', because the universe, including particle&amp;nbsp;''A'', already 'knows' what that measurement, and its outcome, will be.&lt;ref&gt;The quotation is an adaptation from the edited transcript of the radio interview with John Bell of 1985.

== Historical background ==
In the early 1930s, the philosophical implications of the current interpretations of quantum theory troubled many prominent physicists of the day, including [[Albert Einstein]].  In a well-known 1935 paper, [[Boris Podolsky]] and co-authors Einstein and [[Nathan Rosen]] (collectively "EPR") sought to demonstrate by the [[EPR paradox]] that quantum mechanics was incomplete.  This provided hope that a more complete (and less troubling) theory might one day be discovered.  But that conclusion rested on the seemingly reasonable assumptions of ''locality'' and ''realism'' (together called "local realism" or "[[local hidden variables]]", often interchangeably). In the vernacular of Einstein: [[Principle of locality|locality]] meant no instantaneous [[quantum entanglement|("spooky") action at a distance]]; realism meant the moon is there even when not being observed. These assumptions were hotly debated in the physics community, notably [[Bohr–Einstein debates|between Einstein and Niels Bohr]].

In his groundbreaking 1964 paper, "On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox",&lt;ref name=Bell1964/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in {{cite book |title=Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics: Collected Papers on Quantum Philosophy  |author=JS Bell |chapter=Chapter 2:On the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwAhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT8 |isbn=978-0521523387  |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=Alain Aspect introduction to 1987 |pages=14–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; physicist [[John Stewart Bell]] presented an analogy (based on spin measurements on pairs of entangled electrons) to EPR's hypothetical paradox.  Using their reasoning, he said, a choice of measurement setting here should not affect the outcome of a measurement there (and vice versa).  After providing a mathematical formulation of locality and realism based on this, he showed specific cases where this would be inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics theory.

In experimental tests following Bell's example, now using [[quantum entanglement]] of photons instead of electrons, [[John Clauser]] and [[Stuart Freedman]] (1972) and [[Alain Aspect]] ''et al''. (1981) demonstrated that the predictions of quantum mechanics are correct in this regard, although relying on additional unverifiable assumptions that open [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments|loopholes]] for local realism.

In October 2015, Hensen and co-workers&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1038/nature15759 | volume=526 | issue=7575 | title=Loophole-free Bell inequality violation using electron spins separated by 1.3 kilometres | journal=Nature | pages=682–686|bibcode = 2015Natur.526..682H |arxiv=1508.05949 | pmid=26503041 | last1 = Hensen | first1 = B | last2 = Bernien | first2 = H | last3 = Dréau | first3 = AE | last4 = Reiserer | first4 = A | last5 = Kalb | first5 = N | last6 = Blok | first6 = MS | last7 = Ruitenberg | first7 = J | last8 = Vermeulen | first8 = RF | last9 = Schouten | first9 = RN | last10 = Abellán | first10 = C | last11 = Amaya | first11 = W | last12 = Pruneri | first12 = V | last13 = Mitchell | first13 = MW | last14 = Markham | first14 = M | last15 = Twitchen | first15 = DJ | last16 = Elkouss | first16 = D | last17 = Wehner | first17 = S | last18 = Taminiau | first18 = TH | last19 = Hanson | first19 = R| year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that they performed a loophole-free Bell test which might force one to reject at least one of the principles of locality, realism, or [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments#Free choice of detector orientations|freedom-of-choice]] (the last "could" lead to alternative [[Superdeterminism|superdeterministic]] theories).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url= http://www.nature.com/news/quantum-spookiness-passes-toughest-test-yet-1.18255 |author=Zeeya Merali |title=Quantum 'spookiness' passes toughest test yet |journal=Nature |volume= 525 |issue=7567 |pages=14–15 |date=2015-08-27|accessdate=2017-06-03|doi=10.1038/nature.2015.18255 |pmid=26333448 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of these logical possibilities, non-locality and non-realism, correspond to well-developed interpretations of quantum mechanics, and have many supporters; this is not the case for the third logical possibility, non-freedom. Conclusive experimental evidence of the violation of Bell's inequality would drastically reduce the class of acceptable deterministic theories but would not falsify absolute determinism, which was described by Bell himself as "not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behaviour, including our belief that we are free to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined". However, Bell himself considered absolute determinism an implausible solution.

== Overview ==
Bell's theorem states that any physical theory that incorporates [[Principle of locality#Local realism|local realism]] cannot reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanical theory.  Because numerous experiments agree with the predictions of quantum mechanical theory, and show differences between correlations that could not be explained by local hidden variables, the experimental results have been taken by many as refuting the concept of local realism as an explanation of the physical phenomena under test. For a hidden variable theory, if Bell's conditions are correct, the results that agree with quantum mechanical theory appear to indicate [[superluminal]] (faster-than-light) effects, in contradiction to the principle of locality.

These three key concepts – locality, realism, freedom&amp;nbsp;– are highly technical and much debated. In particular, the concept of ''realism'' is now somewhat different from what it was in discussions in the 1930s. It is more precisely called ''[[counterfactual definiteness]]''; it means that we may think of outcomes of measurements that were not actually performed as being just as much part of reality as those that were made. ''Locality'' is short for ''local relativistic causality''. (Currently accepted [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] ''are'' local in the terminology of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian formalism]] and [[Local quantum field theory|axiomatic approach]].) ''Freedom'' refers to the physical possibility of determining settings on measurement devices independently of the internal state of the physical system being measured.

[[Image:Bell test for entangled qubits.svg|thumb|450px|right|Illustration of Bell test for spin-half particles such as electrons. A source produces a [[singlet state|singlet]] pair, one particle is sent to one location, and the other is sent to another location. A [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]] of the entangled property is performed at various angles at each location. The scheme for measurements on [[photons]] looks very similar: the quantum state is different but has very similar properties.]]

The theorem is usually proved by consideration of a quantum system of two [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] [[qubit]]s. The most common examples concern systems of particles that are entangled in [[spin (physics)|spin]] or [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]. Quantum mechanics allows predictions of correlations that would be observed if these two particles have their spin or polarization measured in different directions. Bell showed that if a local hidden variable theory holds, then these correlations would have to satisfy certain constraints, called Bell inequalities. However, for the quantum correlations arising in the specific example considered, those constraints are not satisfied, hence the phenomenon being studied cannot be explained by a local hidden variables theory.

Following the argument in the [[EPR paradox|Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox]] paper (but using the example of spin, as in [[David Bohm]]'s version of the EPR argument&lt;ref name="Bell1964"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bell |first=John |year=1964 |title=On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen Paradox |url=http://www.drchinese.com/David/Bell_Compact.pdf |journal=[[Physics (American Physical Society journal)|Physics]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=195–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohm|first=David|title=Quantum Theory|authorlink=David Bohm|publisher=Prentice−Hall|year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Bell considered an experiment in which there are "a pair of spin one-half particles formed somehow in the [[Singlet state|singlet spin state]] and moving freely in opposite directions."&lt;ref name=Bell1964/&gt; The two particles travel away from each other to two distant locations, at which measurements of spin are performed, along axes that are independently chosen. Each measurement yields a result of either spin-up&amp;nbsp;(+) or spin-down&amp;nbsp;(−); it means, spin in the positive or negative direction of the chosen axis.

The probability of the same result being obtained at the two locations depends on the relative angles at which the two spin measurements are made, and is strictly between zero and one for all relative angles other than perfectly parallel or antiparallel alignments (0° or 180°). Since total angular momentum is conserved, and since the total spin is zero in the singlet state, the probability of the same result with parallel (antiparallel) alignment is 0 (1). This last prediction is true classically as well as quantum mechanically.

Bell's theorem is concerned with correlations defined in terms of averages taken over very many trials of the experiment. The [[Quantum correlation|correlation]] of two binary variables is usually defined in quantum physics as the average of the products of the pairs of measurements. Note that this is different from the usual definition of [[correlation]] in statistics. The quantum physicist's "correlation" is the statistician's "raw (uncentered, unnormalized) product [[Moment (mathematics)|moment]]". They are similar in that, with either definition, if the pairs of outcomes are always the same, the correlation is +1; if the pairs of outcomes are always opposite, the correlation is -1; and if the pairs of outcomes agree 50% of the time, then the correlation is 0. The correlation is related in a simple way to the probability of equal outcomes, namely it is equal to twice the probability of equal outcomes, minus one.

[[Pauli operator|Measuring the spin]] of these entangled particles along anti-parallel directions—i.e., along the same axis but in opposite directions, the set of all results is perfectly correlated. On the other hand, if measurements are performed along parallel directions they always yield opposite results, and the set of measurements shows perfect anti-correlation. This is in accord with the above stated probabilities of measuring the same result in these two cases. Finally, measurement at perpendicular directions has a 50% chance of matching, and the total set of measurements is uncorrelated. These basic cases are illustrated in the table below. Columns should be read as ''examples'' of pairs of values that could be recorded by Alice and Bob with time increasing going to the right.

With the measurements oriented at intermediate angles between these basic cases, the existence of local hidden variables could agree with/would be consistent with a linear dependence of the [[quantum correlation|correlation]] in the angle but, according to Bell's inequality (see below), could not agree with the dependence predicted by quantum mechanical theory, namely, that the correlation is the negative [[cosine]] of the angle.  Experimental results match the curve predicted by quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name="C.B. Parker 1994 542"/&gt;

Over the years, Bell's theorem has undergone a wide variety of experimental tests.  However, various [[Bell test loopholes|common deficiencies in the testing of the theorem]] have been identified, including the ''detection loophole''&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem Article on ''Bell's Theorem''] by Abner Shimony in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''communication loophole''.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; Over the years experiments have been gradually improved to better address these loopholes. In 2015, the first experiment to simultaneously address all of the loopholes was performed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

To date, Bell's theorem is generally regarded as supported by a substantial body of evidence and there are few supporters of local hidden variables, though the theorem is continually the subject of study, criticism, and refinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=David J. |year=1998 |title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson]]/[[Prentice Hall]] |pages=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Importance==
Bell's theorem, derived in his seminal 1964 paper titled ''On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox'',&lt;ref name=Bell1964/&gt; has been called, on the assumption that the theory is correct, "the most profound in science".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stapp|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps of equal importance is Bell's deliberate effort to encourage and bring legitimacy to work on the completeness issues, which had fallen into disrepute.&lt;ref name="Bell 1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=JS|title=On the impossible pilot wave|url=http://prac.us.edu.pl/~ztpce/QM/Bell_pilot_wave.pdf|journal=Foundations of Physics|year=1982|volume=12|issue=10|pages=989–99|doi=10.1007/bf01889272|bibcode = 1982FoPh...12..989B }} Reprinted in ''Speakable and unspeakable in quantum mechanics: collected papers on quantum philosophy''. CUP, 2004, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in his life, Bell expressed his hope that such work would "continue to inspire those who suspect that what is proved by the impossibility proofs is lack of imagination."&lt;ref name="Bell 1982"/&gt;

The title of Bell's seminal article refers to the 1935 paper by [[EPR paradox|Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete? |year=1935 |last1=Einstein |first1=A. |last2=Podolsky |first2=B. |last3=Rosen |first3=N. |journal=Physical Review |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=777–780|bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E|url=http://www.drchinese.com/David/EPR.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics.  In his paper, Bell started from the same two assumptions as did EPR, namely (i) ''reality'' (that microscopic objects have real properties determining the outcomes of quantum mechanical measurements), and (ii) ''locality'' (that reality in one location is not influenced by measurements performed simultaneously at a distant location). Bell was able to derive from those two assumptions an important result, namely Bell's inequality. The theoretical (and later experimental) violation of this inequality implies that at least one of the two assumptions must be false.

In two respects Bell's 1964 paper was a step forward compared to the EPR paper: firstly, it considered more [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] than merely the [[EPR paradox|element of physical reality]] in the EPR paper; and Bell's inequality was, in part, experimentally testable, thus raising the possibility of testing the local realism hypothesis. Limitations on such tests to date are noted below.  Whereas Bell's paper deals only with deterministic hidden variable theories, Bell's theorem was later generalized to [[stochastic]] theories&lt;ref name="Clauser–Horne"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.10.526|title=Experimental consequences of objective local theories|year=1974|last1=Clauser|first1=John F.|journal=Physical Review D|volume=10|issue=2|pages=526–535|bibcode=1974PhRvD..10..526C|url=http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/physics/Clauser1974/Clauser1974.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225072037/http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/physics/Clauser1974/Clauser1974.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well, and it was also realised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Eberhard |first=P. H. |year=1977 |title=Bell's theorem without hidden variables |journal=[[Nuovo Cimento B]] |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=75–80 |doi= 10.1007/BF02726212 |url= http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/08/282/8282046.pdf|bibcode = 1977NCimB..38...75E |arxiv=quant-ph/0010047 |citeseerx=10.1.1.252.6568 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the theorem is not so much about hidden variables, as about the outcomes of measurements that could have been taken instead of the one actually taken. Existence of these variables is called the assumption of realism, or the assumption of [[counterfactual definiteness]].

After the EPR paper, quantum mechanics was in an unsatisfactory position: either it was incomplete, in the sense that it failed to account for some elements of physical reality, or it violated the principle of a finite propagation speed of physical effects. In a modified version of the EPR thought experiment, two hypothetical [[Observer (quantum physics)|observers]], now commonly referred to as [[Alice and Bob|''Alice'' and ''Bob'']], perform independent measurements of spin on a pair of electrons, prepared at a source in a special state called a ''[[spin singlet]] state''. It is the conclusion of EPR that once Alice measures spin in one direction (e.g. on the ''x'' axis), Bob's measurement in that direction is determined with certainty, as being the opposite outcome to that of Alice, whereas immediately before Alice's measurement Bob's outcome was only statistically determined (i.e., was only a probability, not a certainty); thus, either the spin in each direction is an ''element of physical reality'', or the effects travel from Alice to Bob instantly.

In QM, predictions are formulated in terms of [[probability|probabilities]] — for example, the probability that an [[electron]] will be detected in a particular place, or the probability that its spin is up or down. The idea persisted, however, that the electron in fact has a ''definite'' position and spin, and that QM's weakness is its inability to predict those values precisely. The possibility existed that some unknown theory, such as a ''hidden variables theory'', might be able to predict those quantities exactly, while at the same time also being in complete agreement with the probabilities predicted by QM. If such a hidden variables theory exists, then because the hidden variables are not described by QM the latter would be an incomplete theory.

==Local realism==
The concept of local realism is formalized to state, and prove, Bell's theorem and generalizations.  A common approach is the following:
# There is a [[probability space]] {{math|Λ}} and the observed outcomes by both Alice and Bob result by random sampling of the (unknown, "hidden") parameter {{math|''λ'' ∈ Λ}}.
# The values observed by Alice or Bob are functions of the local detector settings and the hidden parameter only. Thus, there are functions {{math|''A'',''B'' : ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × Λ → {-1, +1} }}, where a detector setting is modeled as a location on the unit sphere {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, such that
#*The value observed by Alice with detector setting {{mvar|a}} is {{math|''A''(''a'', ''λ'')}}
#*The value observed by Bob with detector setting {{mvar|b}} is {{math|''B''(''b'', ''λ'')}}

Perfect anti-correlation would require {{math|''B''(''c'', ''λ'') {{=}} −''A''(''c'', ''λ''), ''c'' ∈ ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Implicit in assumption 1) above, the hidden parameter space {{math|Λ}} has a [[probability measure]] {{mvar|μ}} and the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation]] of a random variable {{mvar|X}} on {{math|Λ}} with respect to {{mvar|μ}} is written

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(X) = \int_\Lambda X(\lambda) p(\lambda) d \lambda, &lt;/math&gt;

where for accessibility of notation we assume that the probability measure has a [[probability density]] {{mvar|p}} that therefore is nonnegative and integrates to {{math|1}}. The hidden parameter is often thought of as being associated with the source but it can just as well also contain components associated with the two measurement devices.

== Bell inequalities ==
Bell inequalities concern measurements made by observers on pairs of particles that have interacted and then separated. Assuming local realism, certain constraints must hold on the relationships between the correlations between subsequent measurements of the particles under various possible measurement settings. Let {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} be as above. Define for the present purposes three correlation functions:
*Let {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the experimentally measured correlation defined by
*:&lt;math&gt;C_e(a, b) = \frac{N_{++} + N_{--} - N_{+-} - N_{-+}}{N_{++} + N_{--} + N_{+-} + N_{-+}},&lt;/math&gt;
:where {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;++&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of measurements yielding "spin up" in the direction of {{math|'''a'''}} measured by Alice (first subscript {{math|+}}) ''and'' "spin up" in the direction of {{math|'''b'''}} measured by Bob. The other occurrences of {{mvar|N}} are analogously defined.
*Let {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the correlation as predicted by quantum mechanics. This is given by the expression
*:&lt;math&gt;C_q(a, b) = \left\langle A \left|(\boldsymbol\sigma \cdot \mathbf b)^{(2)}(\boldsymbol\sigma \cdot \mathbf a)^{(1)}\right| A \right\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
:where {{mvar|A}} is the antisymmetric spin wave function. This value is calculated to be
::&lt;math&gt;C_q(a, b) = -\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b.&lt;/math&gt;
*Let {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the correlation as predicted by any hidden variable theory. In the formalization of above, this is
*:&lt;math&gt;C_h(a, b) = E(A(\mathbf{a}, \lambda) B(\mathbf{b}, \lambda)) = \int_\Lambda A(\mathbf{a}, \lambda)B(\mathbf{b}, \lambda) p(\lambda) d\lambda.&lt;/math&gt;

The two-particle spin space is the [[tensor product]] of the two-dimensional spin Hilbert spaces of the individual particles. Each individual space is an [[Irreducible representation|irreducible representation space]] of the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The product space decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations with definite total spins {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} of dimensions {{math|1}} and {{math|3}} respectively. Full details may be found in [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients|Clebsch—Gordan decomposition]]. The total spin zero subspace is spanned by the [[singlet state]] in the product space, a vector explicitly given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  |A\rangle =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\alpha^{(1)}\beta^{(2)} - \beta^{(1)}\alpha^{(2)}\right) =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(
    \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} -
    \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}
  \right),
&lt;/math&gt;

with adjoint in this representation
:&lt;math&gt;\langle A| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\otimes\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}\otimes\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The way single particle operators act on the product space is exemplified below by the example at hand; one defines the tensor product of operators, where the factors are single particle operators, thus if {{math|Π, Ω}} are single particle operators,
:&lt;math&gt;(\Pi \otimes \Omega ) (|x\rangle \otimes |y\rangle) = \Pi|x\rangle \otimes \Omega|y\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi^{(1)} (|x\rangle \otimes |y\rangle) \equiv \Pi|x\rangle \otimes \operatorname{Id}|y\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

etc., where the superscript in parentheses indicates on which Hilbert space in the tensor product space the action is intended and the action is defined by the right hand side. The singlet state has total spin {{math|0}} as may be verified by application of the operator of total spin {{math|'''J''' · '''J''' {{=}} ('''J'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ⋅ ('''J'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} by a calculation similar to that presented below.

The expectation value of the operator
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left(\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{b}\right)^{(2)}\left(\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{a}\right)^{(1)} =
  \left(\operatorname{Id} \otimes \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{b}\right)\left(\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{a} \otimes \operatorname{Id}\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

in the singlet state can be calculated straightforwardly. One has, by definition of the [[Pauli matrices]],

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{a} \otimes \operatorname{Id} = \begin{bmatrix} a_z &amp; a_x - ia_y \\ a_x + ia_y &amp; -a_z \end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Upon left application of this on {{ket|''A''}} one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{a} \otimes \mathrm{Id} |A\rangle =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(
    \begin{bmatrix}a_z \\ a_x + ia_y\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} -
    \begin{bmatrix}a_x - ia_y \\ -a_z\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}
  \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, application (to the left) of the operator corresponding to {{math|'''b'''}} on {{bra|''A''}} yields

:&lt;math&gt;
  \langle A|\operatorname{Id} \otimes \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{b} =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(
    \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}b_x + ib_y &amp; -b_z\end{bmatrix} -
    \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}b_z &amp; b_x - ib_y\end{bmatrix}
  \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

The inner products on the tensor product space is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x \otimes y|u \otimes v\rangle = \langle x|u\rangle\langle y|v\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Given this, the expectation value reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;\langle A|(\boldsymbol\sigma \cdot \mathbf b)^{(2)}(\boldsymbol\sigma \cdot \mathbf a)^{(1)}|A\rangle = -\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b.&lt;/math&gt;

{{Hidden end}}
With this notation, a concise summary of what follows can be made.
*Theoretically, there exists {{math|'''a''', '''b'''}} such that
::&lt;math&gt;C_q \ne C_h,&lt;/math&gt;
:whatever are the particular characteristics of the hidden variable theory as long as it abides to the rules of local realism as defined above. That is to say, no local hidden variable theory can make the same predictions as quantum mechanics.
*Experimentally, instances of
::&lt;math&gt;C_e \ne C_h&lt;/math&gt;
:have been found (whatever the hidden variable theory), but 
::&lt;math&gt;C_e \ne C_q\quad \text{(not found)}&lt;/math&gt;
:has never been found. That is to say, predictions of quantum mechanics have never been falsified by experiment. These experiments include such that can rule out local hidden variable theories. But see below on possible loopholes.

=== Original Bell's inequality ===
The inequality that Bell derived can then be written as:&lt;ref name=Bell1964/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_h(a, c) - C_h(b, a) - C_h(b, c) \le 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|a, b}} and {{mvar|c}} refer to three arbitrary settings of the two analysers. This inequality is however restricted in its application to the rather special case in which the outcomes on both sides of the experiment are always exactly anticorrelated whenever the analysers are parallel. The advantage of restricting attention to this special case is the resulting simplicity of the derivation. In experimental work, the inequality is not very useful because it is hard, if not impossible, to create ''perfect'' anti-correlation.

This simple form has an intuitive explanation, however. It is equivalent to the following elementary result from probability theory. Consider three (highly correlated, and possibly biased) coin-flips {{mvar|X, Y}}, and ''Z'', with the property that:
#''X'' and ''Y'' give the same outcome (both heads or both tails) 99% of the time
#''Y'' and ''Z'' also give the same outcome 99% of the time,

then ''X'' and ''Z'' must also yield the same outcome at least 98% of the time. The number of mismatches between ''X'' and ''Y'' (1/100) plus the number of mismatches between ''Y'' and ''Z'' (1/100) are together the ''maximum possible'' number of mismatches between ''X'' and ''Z'' (a simple [[Fréchet inequalities|Boole–Fréchet inequality]]).

Imagine a pair of particles that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how they are going to be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.

Start with one setting exactly opposite to the other. All the pairs of particles give the same outcome (each pair is either both spin up or both spin down). Now shift Alice's setting by one degree relative to Bob's. They are now one degree off being exactly opposite to one another. A small fraction of the pairs, say ''f'', now give different outcomes. If instead we had left Alice's setting unchanged but shifted Bob's by one degree (in the opposite direction), then again a fraction ''f'' of the pairs of particles turns out to give different outcomes. Finally consider what happens when both shifts are implemented at the same time: the two settings are now exactly two degrees away from being opposite to one another. By the mismatch argument, the chance of a mismatch at two degrees can't be more than twice the chance of a mismatch at one degree: it cannot be more than 2''f''.

Compare this with the predictions from quantum mechanics for the singlet state. For a small angle {{mvar|θ}}, measured in radians, the chance of a different outcome is approximately &lt;math&gt;f_1=\theta^2/4&lt;/math&gt; as explained by [[small-angle approximation]]. At two times this small angle, the chance of a mismatch is therefore about 4 times larger, since &lt;math&gt;f_2=(2\theta)^2/4=2^2 \theta^2/4 \approx 4f_1&lt;/math&gt;. But we just argued that it cannot be more than 2 times as large.

This intuitive formulation is due to [[David Mermin]]. The small-angle limit is discussed in Bell's original article, and therefore goes right back to the origin of the Bell inequalities.

===CHSH inequality===
{{Main article|CHSH inequality}}
Generalizing Bell's original inequality,&lt;ref name=Bell1964/&gt; [[John Clauser]], Michael Horne, [[Abner Shimony]] and R. A. Holt introduced the [[CHSH inequality]],&lt;ref name="Clauser 1969"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.23.880 |title=Proposed Experiment to Test Local Hidden-Variable Theories |year=1969 |last1=Clauser |first1=John |last2=Horne |first2=Michael |last3=Shimony |first3=Abner |last4=Holt |first4=Richard |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=23 |issue=15 |pages=880–884|bibcode = 1969PhRvL..23..880C}}&lt;/ref&gt; which puts classical limits on the set of four correlations in Alice and Bob's experiment, without any assumption of perfect correlations (or anti-correlations) at equal settings

:&lt;math&gt;(1) \quad C_h(a,b) + C_h(a,b') + C_h(a',b) - C_h(a',b') \leq 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Making the special choice &lt;math&gt;a'=b+\pi&lt;/math&gt;, denoting &lt;math&gt;b'=c&lt;/math&gt;, and assuming perfect anti-correlation at equal settings, perfect correlation at opposite settings, therefore &lt;math&gt;\rho(a,a+\pi)=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho(b,a+\pi)=-\rho(b,a)&lt;/math&gt;, the CHSH inequality reduces to the original Bell inequality. Nowadays, (1) is also often simply called "the Bell inequality", but sometimes more completely "the Bell-CHSH inequality".

==== Derivation ====
With abbreviated notation

:&lt;math&gt;A = A(a, \lambda), A' = A(a', \lambda), B = B(b, \lambda), B' = B(b', \lambda),&lt;/math&gt;

the CHSH inequality can be derived as follows. Each of the four quantities is {{math|±1}} and each depends on {{mvar|λ}}. It follows that for any {{math|''λ'' ∈ Λ}}, one of {{math|''B'' + ''B''&amp;prime;}} and {{math|''B'' − ''B''&amp;prime;}} is zero, and the other is {{math|±2}}. From this it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;AB + AB' + A'B - A'B'= A\left(B + B'\right) + A'\left(B - B'\right) \leq 2,&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  C_h(a, b) + C_h\left(a, b'\right) + C_h\left(a', b\right) - C_h\left(a', b'\right) 
    &amp;= \int_\Lambda ABp d\lambda + \int_\Lambda AB'p d\lambda + \int_\Lambda A'Bp d\lambda - \int_\Lambda A'B'p d\lambda \\
    &amp;= \int_\Lambda \left(AB + AB' + A'B - A'B'\right)p d\lambda \\
    &amp;= \int_\Lambda \left(A\left(B + B'\right) + A'\left(B - B'\right)\right) p d\lambda \leq 2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

At the heart of this derivation is a simple algebraic inequality concerning four variables, {{math|''A'', ''A''&amp;prime;, ''B'', ''B''&amp;prime;}}, which take the values {{math|±1}} only:

:&lt;math&gt;AB + AB' + A'B - A'B' = A\left(B + B'\right) + A'\left(B - B'\right) \le 2.&lt;/math&gt;

The CHSH inequality is seen to depend only on the following three key features of a local hidden variables theory: (1) realism: alongside of the outcomes of actually performed measurements, the outcomes of potentially performed measurements also exist at the same time; (2) locality, the outcomes of measurements on Alice's particle don't depend on which measurement Bob chooses to perform on the other particle; (3) freedom: Alice and Bob can indeed choose freely which measurements to perform.

The ''realism'' assumption is actually somewhat idealistic, and Bell's theorem only proves non-locality with respect to variables that only ''exist'' for metaphysical reasons{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. However, before the discovery of quantum mechanics, both realism and locality were completely uncontroversial features of physical theories.

==Bell inequalities are violated by quantum mechanical predictions==
The measurements performed by Alice and Bob are spin measurements on electrons. Alice can choose between two detector settings labeled ''a'' and ''a''′; these settings correspond to measurement of spin along the ''z'' or the ''x'' axis. Bob can choose between two detector settings labeled ''b'' and ''b''′; these correspond to measurement of spin along the ''z''′ or ''x''′ axis, where the {{math|''x''′ − ''z''′}} coordinate system is rotated 135° relative to the {{math|''x'' − ''z''}} coordinate system.  The spin observables are represented by the 2 × 2 self-adjoint matrices:

:&lt;math&gt; S_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp;  0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad S_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

These are the [[Pauli spin matrix|Pauli spin matrices]] normalized so that the corresponding eigenvalues are {{math|±1}}. As is customary, we use the [[bra–ket notation]] to denote the eigenvectors of {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}} by

:&lt;math&gt; \left|+x\right\rang, \quad \left|-x\right\rang. &lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; be the spin singlet state for a pair of electrons discussed in the EPR paradox.  This is a specially constructed state described by the following vector in the tensor product

:&lt;math&gt;|\phi\rang = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \, \left|+x\right\rang \otimes \left|-x\right\rang -\left|-x\right\rang \otimes \left|+x\right\rang \, \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Now let us apply the CHSH formalism to the measurements that can be performed by Alice and Bob.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  A(a)  &amp;= S_z \otimes I\\
  A(a') &amp;= S_x \otimes I\\
  B(b)  &amp;= -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ I \otimes (S_z + S_x)\\
  B(b') &amp;=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ I \otimes (S_z - S_x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The operators &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle B(b'), B(b)&lt;/math&gt; correspond to Bob's spin measurements along ''x''′ and ''z''′. Note that the {{mvar|A}} operators commute with the {{mvar|B}} operators, so we can apply our calculation for the correlation. In this case, we can show that the CHSH inequality fails. In fact, a straightforward calculation shows that {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \left\langle A(a) B(b) \right\rangle = \left\langle A\left(a'\right) B(b) \right\rangle =
    \left\langle A\left(a'\right) B\left(b'\right) \right\rangle &amp;=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
                \left\langle A(a) B\left(b'\right) \right\rangle &amp;= -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left\langle A(a) B(b) \right\rangle + \left\langle A\left(a'\right) B\left(b'\right) \right\rangle +
  \left\langle A\left(a'\right) B(b) \right\rangle - \left\langle A(a) B\left(b'\right) \right\rangle =
    \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}} = 2\sqrt{2} &gt; 2
&lt;/math&gt;

Bell's Theorem: If the quantum mechanical formalism is correct, then the system consisting of a pair of entangled electrons cannot satisfy the principle of local realism.  Note that {{math|2{{sqrt|2}}}} is indeed the upper bound for quantum mechanics called [[Tsirelson's bound]]. The operators giving this maximal value are always [[isomorphic]] to the Pauli matrices.

== Testing by practical experiments ==
[[Image:Bell-test-photon-analyer.png|450px|thumb|right|'''Scheme of a "two-channel" Bell test'''&lt;br /&gt;The source S produces pairs of "photons", sent in opposite directions. Each photon encounters a two-channel polariser whose orientation (a or b) can be set by the experimenter. Emerging signals from each channel are detected and coincidences of four types (++, −−, +− and −+) counted by the coincidence monitor.]]
{{Main article|Bell test experiments}}

Experimental tests can determine whether the Bell inequalities required by local realism hold up to the empirical evidence.

Actually, most experiments have been performed using polarization of photons rather than spin of electrons (or other spin-half particles). The quantum state of the pair of entangled photons is not the singlet state, and the correspondence between angles and outcomes is different from that in the spin-half set-up. The polarization of a photon is measured in a pair of perpendicular directions. Relative to a given orientation, polarization is either vertical (denoted by V or by +) or horizontal (denoted by H or by -). The photon pairs are generated in the quantum state

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left (|V\rangle\otimes |V\rangle+|H\rangle\otimes|H\rangle \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;|V\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|H\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the state of a single vertically or horizontally polarized photon, respectively (relative to a fixed and common reference direction for both particles).

When the polarization of both photons is measured in the same direction, both give the same outcome: perfect correlation. When measured at directions making an angle 45° with one another, the outcomes are completely random (uncorrelated). Measuring at directions at 90° to one another, the two are perfectly anti-correlated. In general, when the polarizers are at an angle {{mvar|θ}} to one another, the correlation is {{math|cos(2''θ'')}}. So relative to the correlation function for the singlet state of spin half particles, we have a positive rather than a negative cosine function, and angles are halved: the correlation is periodic with period {{mvar|π}} instead of {{math|2''π''}}.

Bell's inequalities are tested by "coincidence counts" from a Bell test experiment such as the optical one shown in the diagram.  Pairs of particles are emitted as a result of a quantum process, analysed with respect to some key property such as polarisation direction, then detected.  The setting (orientations) of the analysers are selected by the experimenter.

Bell test experiments to date overwhelmingly violate Bell's inequality.

===Two classes of Bell inequalities===
The ''fair sampling'' problem was faced openly in the 1970s. In early designs of their 1973 experiment, Freedman and Clauser&lt;ref name="Clauser–Freedman"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.28.938 |title=Experimental Test of Local Hidden-Variable Theories |year=1972 |last1=Freedman |first1=Stuart J. |last2=Clauser |first2=John F. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=28 |issue=14 |pages=938–941|bibcode = 1972PhRvL..28..938F |url= http://dieumsnh.qfb.umich.mx/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Freedman.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; used ''fair sampling'' in the form of the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt (CHSH&lt;ref name="Clauser 1969"/&gt;) hypothesis. However, shortly afterwards Clauser and Horne&lt;ref name="Clauser–Horne"/&gt;  made the important distinction between inhomogeneous (IBI) and homogeneous (HBI) Bell inequalities. Testing an IBI requires that we compare certain coincidence rates in two separated detectors with the singles rates of the two detectors. Nobody needed to perform the experiment, because singles rates with all detectors in the 1970s were at least ten times all the coincidence rates. So, taking into account this low detector efficiency, the QM prediction actually satisfied the IBI. To arrive at an experimental design in which the QM prediction violates IBI we require detectors whose efficiency exceeds 82.8% for singlet states,&lt;ref name="Garg &amp; Mermin, 1987"&gt;{{citation |author1=Anupam Garg |author2=N.D. Mermin |year=1987 |title=Detector inefficiencies in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment |journal=Phys. Rev. D |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=3831–5 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.35.3831|bibcode = 1987PhRvD..35.3831G }}&lt;/ref&gt; but have very low dark rate and short dead and resolving times. This is now within reach.

===Practical challenges===
{{Main article|Loopholes in Bell test experiments}}

Because, at that time, even the best detectors didn't detect a large fraction of all photons, Clauser and Horne&lt;ref name="Clauser–Horne"/&gt; recognized that testing Bell's inequality required some extra assumptions. They introduced the ''No Enhancement Hypothesis'' (NEH):

{{quote|A light signal, originating in an [[atomic cascade]] for example, has a certain probability of activating a detector.  Then, if a polarizer is interposed between the cascade and the detector, the detection probability cannot increase.}}

Given this assumption, there is a Bell inequality between the coincidence rates with polarizers and coincidence rates without polarizers.

The experiment was performed by Freedman and Clauser,&lt;ref name="Clauser–Freedman"/&gt; who found that the Bell's inequality was violated. So the no-enhancement hypothesis cannot be true in a local hidden variables model.

While early experiments used atomic cascades,  later experiments have used parametric down-conversion, following a suggestion by Reid and Walls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1-link=Margaret D. Reid |first1=M. D. |last1=Reid |first2=D. F. |last2=Walls |title= Violations of classical inequalities in quantum optics|journal=[[Physical Review A]]|volume=34|issue=2 |pages=1260–1276|year=1986|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.34.1260|bibcode = 1986PhRvA..34.1260R }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving improved generation and detection properties. As a result, the most recent experiments with photons no longer suffer from the detection loophole (see [[Bell test experiments]]). This makes the photon the first experimental system for which all main experimental loopholes have been surmounted, albeit presently only in separate experiments (Giustina et al. (2013), ''Bell violation using entangled photons without the fair-sampling assumption'', Nature 497, 227–230; B.G. Christensen et al. (2013), ''Detection-Loophole-Free Test of Quantum Nonlocality, and Applications'', arXiv:1306.5772).

== Metaphysical aspects ==
Most advocates of the hidden-variables idea believe that experiments have ruled out local hidden variables.  They are ready to give up locality, explaining the violation of Bell's inequality by means of a non-local [[hidden variable theory]], in which the particles exchange information about their states. This is the basis of the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which requires that all particles in the universe be able to instantaneously exchange information with all others. A 2007 experiment ruled out a large class of non-Bohmian non-local hidden variable theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature05677 |title=An experimental test of non-local realism |year=2007 |last1=Gröblacher |first1=Simon |last2=Paterek |first2=Tomasz |last3=Kaltenbaek |first3=Rainer |last4=Brukner |first4=Časlav |last5=Żukowski |first5=Marek |last6=Aspelmeyer |first6=Markus |last7=Zeilinger |first7=Anton |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue=7138 |pages=871–5 |pmid=17443179|bibcode = 2007Natur.446..871G | arxiv= 0704.2529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the hidden variables can communicate with each other faster than light, Bell's inequality can easily be violated. Once one particle is measured, it can communicate the necessary correlations to the other particle. Since in relativity the notion of simultaneity is not absolute, this is unattractive. One idea is to replace instantaneous communication with a process that travels backwards in time along the past [[light cone]]. This is the idea behind a [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which interprets the statistical emergence of a quantum history as a gradual coming to agreement between histories that go both forward and backward in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.58.647|title=The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics|year=1986|last1=Cramer|first1=John|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics| volume=58| issue=3| pages=647–687| bibcode = 1986RvMP...58..647C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few advocates of deterministic models have not given up on local hidden variables. For example, [[Gerard 't Hooft]] has argued that the [[superdeterminism]] loophole cannot be dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=0908.3408 |author1=Gerard 't Hooft |title=Entangled quantum states in a local deterministic theory |class=quant-ph |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=quant-ph/0701097|author1=Gerard 't Hooft|title=The Free-Will Postulate in Quantum Mechanics |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible (but not universally accepted) solution is offered by the [[many-worlds interpretation|many worlds theory]] of quantum mechanics. According to this, not only is collapse of the wave function illusory, but the apparent random branching of possible futures when quantum systems interact with the macroscopic world is also an illusion. Measurement does not lead to a random choice of possible outcome; rather, the only ingredient of quantum mechanics is the unitary evolution of the wave function. All possibilities co-exist forever and the only reality is the quantum mechanical wave function. According to this view, two distant observers both split into superpositions when measuring a spin. The Bell inequality violations are no longer counterintuitive, because it is not clear which copy of the observer B will be seen by observer A when they compare notes. If reality includes all the different outcomes, locality in physical space (not outcome space) places no restrictions on how the split observers can meet up.

This point underlines the fact that the argument that realism is incompatible with quantum mechanics and locality depends on a particular formalization of the concept of realism. In its weakest form, the assumption underpinning that particular formalization is called [[counterfactual definiteness]]. This is the assumption that outcomes of measurements that are not performed are just as real as those of measurements that were performed.  Counterfactual definiteness is an uncontroversial property of all classical physical theories prior to quantum theory, due to their determinism. Many worlds interpretations are not only counterfactually indefinite, but are also factually indefinite. The results of all experiments, even ones that have been performed, are not uniquely determined.

If one chooses to reject counterfactual definiteness, reality has been made smaller, and there is no non-locality problem. On the other hand, one is thereby introducing irreducible or intrinsic randomness into our picture of the world: randomness that cannot be "explained" as merely the reflection of our ignorance of underlying, variable, physical quantities. Non-determinism becomes a fundamental property of nature.

Assuming counterfactual definiteness, reality has been enlarged, and there is a non-locality problem. On the other hand, in the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, reality consists only of a deterministically evolving wave function and non-locality is a non-issue.

There have also been repeated claims that Bell's arguments are irrelevant because they depend on hidden assumptions that, in fact, are questionable.  For example, [[E. T. Jaynes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Clearing up Mysteries—The Original Goal |year=1989 |last1=Jaynes |first1=E. T. |journal=Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods |pages=1–27 | url=http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf |doi=10.1007/978-94-015-7860-8_1|isbn=978-90-481-4044-2 |citeseerx=10.1.1.46.1264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1989 that there are two hidden assumptions in Bell's theorem that could limit its generality. According to him:
# Bell interpreted conditional probability P(X|Y) as a causal inference, i.e. Y exerted a causal inference on X in reality.  However, P(X|Y) actually only means logical inference (induction).  Causes cannot travel faster than light or backward in time, but deduction can.
# Bell's inequality does not apply to some possible hidden variable theories. It only applies to a certain class of local hidden variable theories.  In fact, it might have just missed the kind of hidden variable theories that Einstein is most interested in.

However, [[Richard D. Gill]] has argued that Jaynes misunderstood Bell's analysis. Gill points out that in the same conference volume in which Jaynes argues against Bell, Jaynes confesses to being extremely impressed by a short proof by [[Steve Gull]] presented at the same conference, that the singlet correlations could not be reproduced by a computer simulation of a local hidden variables theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Time, Finite Statistics, and Bell's Fifth Position |year=2003 |last1=Gill |first1=Richard D. |journal=Proc. Of "Foundations of Probability and Physics - 2", Ser. Math. Modelling in Phys., Engin., and Cogn. Sc. |volume=5/2002| pages=179–206 |arxiv= quant-ph/0301059|bibcode = 2003quant.ph..1059G }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jaynes (writing nearly 30 years after Bell's landmark contributions), it would probably take us another 30 years to fully appreciate Gull's stunning result.

In 2006 a flurry of activity about implications for determinism arose with the paper: [[Free will theorem|''The Free Will Theorem'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Conway | first = John |author2=Simon Kochen | year = 2006 | title = The Free Will Theorem | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 36 | issue = 10 | pages = 1441–1473 | doi = 10.1007/s10701-006-9068-6 |arxiv = quant-ph/0604079 |bibcode = 2006FoPh...36.1441C }}&lt;/ref&gt; which stated "the response of a spin 1 particle to a triple experiment is free—that is to say, is not a function of properties of that part of the universe that is earlier than this response with respect to any given inertial frame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Conway, John H. |author2=Simon Kochen  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The strong free will theorem |journal= Notices of the AMS |volume=56 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=226–232 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200902/rtx090200226p.pdf?q=will&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=k71jU8X7DoypyASw9YGoCA&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAB&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7L-k87yWE32ru0rDjkLOdg12LRQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theorem raised awareness of a tension between determinism fully governing an experiment (on the one hand) and Alice and Bob being free to choose any settings they like for their observations (on the other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cator, Eric |author2=Klaas Landsman  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Constraints on determinism: Bell versus Conway–Kochen |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=44 |issue=7 |year=2014 |pages=781–791 |doi=10.1007/s10701-014-9815-z|arxiv = 1402.1972 |bibcode = 2014FoPh...44..781C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Esfeld, Michael |title=Bell's Theorem and the Issue of Determinism and Indeterminism |journal= Foundations of Physics |year=2015 |pages= 471–482|arxiv = 1503.00660 | doi = 10.1007/s10701-015-9883-8 |volume=45|issue=5 |bibcode = 2015FoPh...45..471E }}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher David Hodgson supports this theorem as showing that determinism is ''unscientific'', and that quantum mechanics allows observers (at least in some instances) the freedom to make observations of their choosing, thereby leaving the door open for free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David Hodgson |title=Rationality + Consciousness = Free Will |chapter=Chapter 7: Science and determinism |isbn=9780199845309 |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4SGsmowYARsC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Conway+and+Kochen+call+the+free+will+theorem%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UiMYVeTBII3woATFkoKAAQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Conway%20and%20Kochen%20call%20the%20free%20will%20theorem%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General remarks==
The violations of Bell's inequalities, due to quantum entanglement, provide near definitive demonstrations of something that was already strongly suspected: that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the classical picture of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roger |last=Penrose |title=The Road to Reality |edition= |page=583 |year=2007 |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-77631-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some earlier elements that had seemed incompatible with classical pictures included [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] and [[wavefunction collapse]]. The Bell violations show that no resolution of such issues can avoid the ultimate strangeness of quantum behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=E. |last=Abers |title=Quantum Mechanics |edition= |pages=193–195 |year=2004 |publisher=Addison Wesley |isbn=9780131461000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPR paper "pinpointed" the unusual properties of the ''entangled states'', e.g. the above-mentioned singlet state, which is the foundation for present-day applications of quantum physics, such as [[quantum cryptography]]; one application involves the measurement of quantum entanglement as a physical source of bits for [[Michael O. Rabin|Rabin's]] [[oblivious transfer]] protocol. This non-locality was originally supposed to be illusory, because the standard interpretation could easily do away with action-at-a-distance by simply assigning to each particle definite spin-states for all possible spin directions. The EPR argument was: therefore these definite states exist, therefore quantum theory is incomplete, since they do not appear in the theory. Bell's theorem showed that the "entangledness" prediction of quantum mechanics has a degree of non-locality that cannot be explained away by any local theory.

What is powerful about Bell's theorem is that it doesn't refer to any particular physical theory. It shows that nature violates the most general assumptions behind classical pictures, not just details of some particular models. No combination of local deterministic and local random variables can reproduce the phenomena predicted by quantum mechanics and repeatedly observed in experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=R.G.

A unit of [[real estate]] or [[immovable property]] is limited by a legal '''boundary''' (sometimes also referred to as a '''property line''' or a '''lot line'''). The boundary (in Latin: ''limes'') may appear as a discontinuation in the terrain: a ditch, a bank, a hedge, a wall, or similar, but essentially, a legal boundary is a conceptual entity, a [[social construct]], adjunct to the likewise abstract entity of [[property rights]].

A [[cadastral map]] displays how boundaries subdivide land into units of [[ownership]]. However, the relations between society, owner, and land in any culture or [[jurisdiction]] is conceived of in terms more complex than a [[tessellation]]. Therefore, the society concerned has to specify the rules and means by which the boundary concept is materialized and located on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Turk, Andrew (2007) Representations of Tribal Boundaries of Australian Indigenous Peoples and the Implications for Geographic Information Systems. pp 232 - 244 in Dyson, ''et al'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'Western' version of the [[operationalization]] might be a legally specified procedure, performed by a [[Chartered Surveyor|chartered surveyor]], supported by statements from neighbors and pertinent documents, and resulting in official recording in the [[cadastre]] as well as boundary markings in the field. Alternatively, indigenous people represent boundaries through ephemeral performances, such as [[Songlines|song]] and dance, and, when in more permanent form, e.g. paintings or carvings, in artistic or metaphorical manner.&lt;ref&gt;Muecke, S., Benterrak, K., &amp; Roe P. (1984) Reading the country: An introduction to nomadology. Fremantle, W.A.: Fremantle Arts Centre Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identifying boundaries ==
[[File:Property line, crossing is by revocable license only.jpg|thumb|A private property line plaque separating the private property and the public [[right of way]] on a [[sidewalk]] in [[New York City]]. It declares that the public may utilize the space inside the private property by a revocable license, to prevent it to become a [[prescriptive easement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jordan|first1=Cora|last2=Randolph|first2=Mary|title=Neighbor law : fences, trees, boundaries, and noise|date=1994|publisher=Nolo Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780873372664|edition=2nd|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/forestry/easement/easementsacquiredbyuseofproperty.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2014|chapter=Easements Acquired by Use of Property|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318213516/http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/forestry/easement/easementsacquiredbyuseofproperty.pdf#|archive-date=2015-03-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Legal boundaries are usually established by a professional [[surveying|surveyor]] using a [[theodolite|transit]] and or modern [[Global Positioning System|Global Positioning System (GPS)]] technology. The coordinates of the property line are often described on a drawing called a "plot plan" or "[[plat]]" by indicating the length of the boundary along a specific compass bearing in relation to a verifiable "point of beginning". The [[metes and bounds]] method is also used to provide a legal description of a property.

On maps, the line may be marked with {{unichar|214a|PROPERTY LINE|size=200%|html=}}.

The &amp;#8522; symbol may also be used in architectural drawings and CAD design to show plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text Symbols and Special Characters Reference|url=https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/files/GUID-518E1A9D-398C-4A8A-AC32-2D85590CDBE1-htm.html|website=AutoDesk Knowledge Network|publisher=AutoDesk AutoCAD|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Boxer Rebellion}}
{{Chinese |t = 義和團運動 |s = {{Linktext|义|和|团|运动}} |p = Yìhétuán Yùndòng |l = Militia United in Righteousness Movement}}

The '''Boxer Rebellion''' ({{lang|zh-hant|拳亂}}), '''Boxer Uprising''', or '''Yihetuan Movement''' ({{lang|zh-hant|義和團運動}}) was an anti-foreign, [[anti-colonial]], and [[anti-Christian movement|anti-Christian]] uprising that took place in [[China]] between 1899 and 1901, toward the end of the [[Qing dynasty]]. They were motivated by proto-[[Chinese nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments and by opposition to [[Western world|Western]] [[colonialism]] and the [[Protestant missions in China|Christian missionary activity]] that was associated with it.

It was initiated by the [[Yìhéquán|Militia United in Righteousness]] (''[[Yìhéquán|Yihetuan]]''), known in English as the ''Boxers'', for many of their members had been practitioners of [[Chinese martial arts]], also referred to in the west as ''Chinese Boxing''. The uprising took place against a background that included severe drought and disruption caused by the growth of foreign [[spheres of influence]]. After several months of growing violence in [[Shandong]] and the [[North China plain]] against the foreign and [[Christian]] presence in June 1900, Boxer fighters, convinced they were invulnerable to foreign weapons, converged on [[Beijing]] with the slogan ''Support the Qing government and exterminate the foreigners''. Foreigners and Chinese Christians sought refuge in the [[Beijing Legation Quarter|Legation Quarter]].

In response to reports of an armed invasion by allied American, Austro-Hungarian, British, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Russian forces to lift the siege, the initially hesitant [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] supported the Boxers and on June{{nbsp}}21 issued an [[Imperial Decree of declaration of war against foreign powers|Imperial Decree]] [[Declaration of war|declaring war]] on the foreign powers. Diplomats, foreign civilians, and soldiers as well as [[Christianity in China|Chinese Christians]] in the Legation Quarter were detained for 55 days by the Imperial Army of China and the Boxers.

Chinese officialdom was split between those supporting the Boxers and those favoring conciliation, led by [[Yikuang, Prince Qing|Prince Qing]]. The supreme commander of the Chinese forces, the Manchu General [[Ronglu]] (Junglu), later claimed he acted to protect the besieged foreigners. Many officials refused the imperial order to fight against foreigners in their [[Mutual Protection of Southeast China]], because Qing had lost the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] five years before.

The [[Eight-Nation Alliance]], after being initially turned back, brought 20,000 armed troops to China, defeated the Imperial Army, and arrived at Peking on August{{nbsp}}14, relieving the [[Siege of the International Legations|siege of the Legations]]. Uncontrolled plunder of the capital and the surrounding countryside ensued, along with the [[summary execution]] of those suspected of being Boxers.

The [[Boxer Protocol]] of 7 September 1901 provided for the [[Capital punishment|execution]] of government officials who had supported the Boxers, provisions for foreign troops to be stationed in Beijing, and 450&amp;nbsp;million [[tael]]s of [[silver]]—approximately $10&amp;nbsp;billion at 2018 silver prices and more than the government's annual [[tax revenue]]—to be paid as [[indemnity]] over the course of the next thirty-nine years to the eight nations involved. The Empress Dowager then sponsored a set of [[New Policies|institutional and fiscal changes]] in a [[Xinhai Revolution|failed attempt]] to save the dynasty.

==Historical background==

===Origins of the Boxers===
[[File:BoxerRevolutionarybyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wax sculpture|Model made out of wax]] of a Boxer, armed with a spear and sword.&lt;br&gt;Model by George S. Stuart]]
[[File:Boxer Rebellion.png|thumb|upright-1.2|Boxer Rebellion and Eight-Nation Alliance, China 1900-1901]]

The Righteous and Harmonious Fists (Yihequan) arose in the inland sections of the northern coastal province of [[Shandong]], long known for social unrest, religious sects, and martial societies. American Christian missionaries were probably the first to refer to the well-trained, athletic young men as "Boxers", because of the martial arts and weapons training they practiced. Their primary practice was a type of [[Chinese spirit possession|spiritual possession]] which involved the whirling of swords, violent prostrations, and chanting incantations to deities.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Larry Clinton (2009), ''William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary'', Jefferson, NC: McFarland and Co., Inc., p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The opportunities to fight back Western encroachment and colonization were especially attractive to unemployed village men, many of whom were teenagers.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jVESdBSMasMC&amp;pg=PA114 114]}} The tradition of possession and invulnerability went back several hundred years but took on special meaning against the powerful new weapons of the West.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987| pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jVESdBSMasMC&amp;pg=PA54 xii, 54- 59, 96, etc.]}}  The Boxers, armed with rifles and swords, claimed supernatural invulnerability towards blows of cannon, rifle shots, and knife attacks. Furthermore, the Boxer groups popularly claimed that millions of soldiers of [[Tian|Heaven]] would descend to assist them in purifying China of foreign oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAxresT12ogC&amp;pg=PA112|title=The origins of the Boxer War: a multinational study|author=Lanxin Xiang|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|page=114|isbn=0-7007-1563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These beliefs are characteristic of [[millenarianism|millenarian]] movements of [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] resistance, especially the characteristic magical belief, shared by the [[Ghost Dance]]rs of North America and the Kartelite Cults of Africa, that the believer could be rendered invulnerable to bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Landes|first=Richard|editor=James R Lewis|title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRESDAAAQBAJ|date=17 July 2008|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0-19-536964-9|chapter=Millennialism|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=sRESDAAAQBAJ 342]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, in spite of ambivalence toward their heterodox practices, [[Yuxian (Qing dynasty)|Yuxian]], a Manchu who was then prefect of [[Cao Prefecture|Caozhou]] and would later become provincial governor, used the [[Big Swords Society]] in fighting bandits. The Big Swords, emboldened by this official support, also attacked their local Catholic village rivals, who turned to the Church for protection. The Big Swords responded by attacking Catholic churches and [[Church arson|burning]] them. "The line between Christians and bandits", remarks one recent historian, "became increasingly indistinct." As a result of diplomatic pressure in the capital, Yuxian executed several Big Sword leaders, but did not punish anyone else. More martial secret societies started emerging after this.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997| p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ky4_whmgIZcC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}}

The early years saw a variety of village activities, not a broad movement with a united purpose. Martial folk religious societies such as the [[Baguadao]] (Eight Trigrams) prepared the way for the Boxers. Like the Red Boxing school or the [[Plum Flower tradition|Plum Flower Boxers]], the Boxers of Shandong were more concerned with traditional social and moral values, such as filial piety, than with foreign influences. One leader, Zhu Hongdeng (Red Lantern Zhu), started as a wandering healer, specializing in skin ulcers, and gained wide respect by refusing payment for his treatments.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ky4_whmgIZcC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30 27–30]}} Zhu claimed descent from [[Ming dynasty]] emperors, since his surname was the surname of the Ming imperial family. He announced that his goal was to "Revive the Qing and destroy the foreigners" ("扶清灭洋 ''fu Qing mie yang''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAxresT12ogC&amp;pg=PA115|title=The origins of the Boxer War: a multinational study|author=Lanxin Xiang|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|page=115|isbn=0-7007-1563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of conflict and unrest===

''Punch'' Aug 23, 1899, by [[J. S. Pughe]]]]

European legations had a particular jurisdiction status in Peking: they were not subject to Chinese authorities. A den of robbers had been formed in the out-buildings of the German legation, mainly among Lutheran missionaries. They were doing pillage in the city as much as they could, then took shelter in the European legations to escape any punishment for their criminal acts, hence triggering exasperation among the townspeople. The German minister, in an attempt to stop the rising counter-movement, set himself to harrangue the mob, but he only succeeded to get himself killed in the turmoil. To avenge this outrage, a retaliation expedition was organized at once, involving most European states in the wake of Germany.

The combination of extreme weather conditions, Western attempts at colonizing China and growing anti-imperialist sentiment fueled the movement. First, a drought followed by floods in Shandong province in 1897–1898 forced farmers to flee to cities and seek food. As one observer said, "I am convinced that a few days' heavy rainfall to terminate the long-continued drought ... would do more to restore tranquility than any measures which either the Chinese government or foreign governments can take."{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=9}}

A major cause of discontent in north China was missionary activity. The [[Treaty of Tientsin]] (or Tianjin) and the [[Convention of Peking]], signed in 1860 after the [[Second Opium War]], had granted foreign missionaries the freedom to preach anywhere in China and to buy land on which to build churches.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=77}} On 1 November 1897, a band of armed men who were perhaps members of the [[Big Swords Society]] stormed the residence of a German missionary from the [[Society of the Divine Word]] and killed two priests. This attack is known as the [[Juye Incident]].

When [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] received news of these murders, he dispatched the [[German East Asia Squadron]] to occupy [[Jiaozhou Bay]] on the southern coast of the Shandong peninsula. {{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jVESdBSMasMC&amp;pg=PA363 123]}} Germany's action triggered a "scramble for [[concession (territory)|concessions]]" by which Britain, France, Russia and Japan also secured their own [[sphere of influence]] in China.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=129–30}}

In October 1898, a group of Boxers attacked the Christian community of Liyuantun village where a temple to the [[Jade Emperor]] had been converted into a Catholic church. Disputes had surrounded the church since 1869, when the temple had been granted to the Christian residents of the village. This incident marked the first time the Boxers used the slogan "Support the Qing, destroy the foreigners" ("扶清灭洋 ''fu Qing mie yang''") that would later characterise them.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=143–144, 163}} The "Boxers" called themselves the "Militia United in Righteousness" for the first time one year later, at the [[Battle of Senluo Temple]] (October 1899), a clash between Boxers and Qing government troops.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=253}} By using the word "Militia" rather than "Boxers", they distanced themselves from forbidden martial arts sects, and tried to give their movement the legitimacy of a group that defended orthodoxy.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=32}}

Aggression toward missionaries and Christians drew the ire of foreign (mainly European) governments.&lt;ref&gt;Spence (1999) pp. 231–232.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, the French minister in Beijing helped the missionaries to obtain an edict granting official status to every order in the Roman Catholic hierarchy, enabling local priests to support their people in legal or family disputes and bypass the local officials. After the German government took over Shandong many Chinese feared that the foreign missionaries and quite possibly all Christian activities were imperialist attempts at "carving the melon", i.e., to divide and colonize China piece by piece.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|loc=Ch 3 "Imperialism for Christ's Sake", pp. 68–95}} A Chinese official expressed the animosity towards foreigners succinctly, "Take away your missionaries and your opium and you will be welcome."{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=12}}

The early growth of the Boxer movement coincided with the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] (11 June – 21 September 1898). Progressive Chinese officials, with support from Protestant missionaries, persuaded the [[Guangxu Emperor]] to institute reforms which alienated many conservative officials by their sweeping nature. Such opposition from conservative officials led [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] to intervene and reverse the reforms. The failure of the reform movement disillusioned many educated Chinese and thus further weakened the Qing government. After the reforms ended, the conservative Empress Dowager Cixi seized power and placed the reformist Guangxu Emperor under house arrest.

The national crisis was widely seen as being caused by foreign aggression.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p=114}} Foreign powers had defeated China in several wars, forced a right to promote Christianity and imposed [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] under which foreigners and foreign companies in China were accorded special privileges, extraterritorial rights and immunities from Chinese law, causing resentment among the Chinese. France, Japan, Russia and Germany carved out spheres of influence, so that by 1900 it appeared that China would likely be dismembered, with foreign powers each ruling a part of the country. Thus, by 1900, the Qing dynasty, which had ruled China for more than two centuries, was crumbling and Chinese culture was under assault by powerful and unfamiliar religions and secular cultures.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=7–8}}

===Intensifying crisis===

Bodin |year=1979 |publisher=Osprey |pages=26, 40 |isbn=0-85045-335-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

In January 1900, with a majority of conservatives in the imperial court, Empress Dowager Cixi changed her position on the Boxers, and issued edicts in their defence, causing protests from foreign powers. In spring 1900, the Boxer movement spread rapidly north from Shandong into the countryside near Beijing. Boxers burned Christian churches, killed Chinese Christians and intimidated Chinese officials who stood in their way. American Minister [[Edwin H. Conger]] cabled Washington, "the whole country is swarming with hungry, discontented, hopeless idlers." On 30 May the diplomats, led by British Minister [[Claude Maxwell MacDonald]], requested that foreign soldiers come to Beijing to defend the legations. The Chinese government reluctantly acquiesced, and the next day a multinational force of 435 navy troops from eight countries disembarked from warships and travelled by train from [[Taku Forts|Dagu (Taku)]] to Beijing. They set up defensive perimeters around their respective missions.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 42 }}

On 5 June 1900, the railway line to Tianjin was cut by Boxers in the countryside and Beijing was isolated. On 11 June, at [[Yongdingmen|Yongding gate]], the secretary of the Japanese legation, Sugiyama Akira, was [[Kansu Braves#Assassination of Sugiyama Akira|attacked and killed by the soldiers]] of general [[Dong Fuxiang]], who were guarding the southern part of the Beijing walled city.{{sfnb|Preston|2000|p =70}} Armed with [[Mauser]] rifles but wearing traditional uniforms,{{sfnb|Elliott| 2002|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=wWvl9O4Gn1UC 126]}} Dong's troops had threatened the foreign Legations in the fall of 1898 soon after arriving in Beijing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAxresT12ogC|title=The origins of the Boxer War: a multinational study|author=Lanxin Xiang|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|page=207|isbn=0-7007-1563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; so much that troops from the [[United States Marine Corps]] had been called to Beijing to guard the legations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=S8YtE0SIDq0C&amp;pg=PA25 |title=The United States Marines in North China, 1894–1942 |author=Chester M.

The Caliph agreed to the Kaiser's request and sent Enver Pasha (''not'' the [[Enver Pasha|future Young Turk leader]]) to China in 1901, but the rebellion was over by that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PvVlS3ljx20C&amp;pg=PA237|title=The politicization of Islam: reconstructing identity, state, faith, and community in the late Ottoman state|author=Kemal H.

===Seymour Expedition===
{{main|Seymour Expedition}}
[[File:BoxerJapaneseMarines.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese marines who served in the [[Seymour Expedition]]]]

As the situation grew more violent, a second multinational force of 2,000 sailors and marines under the command of the British Vice-Admiral [[Edward Hobart Seymour|Edward Seymour]], the largest contingent being British, was dispatched from Dagu to Beijing on 10 June 1900. The troops were transported by train from Dagu to Tianjin with the agreement of the Chinese government, but the railway between Tianjin and Beijing had been severed. Seymour resolved to move forward and repair the railway, or progress on foot if necessary, keeping in mind that the distance between Tianjin and Beijing was only 120&amp;nbsp;km. When Seymour left Tianjin and started toward Beijing, it angered the imperial court.

As a result, the pro-Boxer Manchu Prince Duan became leader of the Zongli Yamen (foreign office), replacing Prince Qing. Prince Duan was a member of the imperial [[Aisin Gioro]] clan (foreigners called him a "Blood Royal"), and Empress Dowager Cixi had named her son as next in line for the [[Dragon Throne|imperial throne]]. He became the effective leader of the Boxers, and was extremely anti-foreigner. He soon ordered the Qing imperial army to attack the foreign forces. Confused by conflicting orders from Beijing, General [[Nie Shicheng]] let Seymour's army pass by in their trains.{{sfn|Leonhard|p=12}}

[[File:SeymourTianjin.jpg|thumb|Admiral Seymour returning to Tianjin with his wounded men on 26 June]]

After leaving Tianjin, the convoy quickly reached Langfang, but found the railway there to be destroyed. Seymour's engineers tried to repair the line, but the allied army found itself surrounded, as the railway both behind and in front of them had been destroyed. They were attacked from all parts by Chinese irregulars and Chinese governmental troops. Five thousand of Dong Fuxiang's "[[Kansu Braves|Gansu Braves]]" and an unknown number of "Boxers" won a costly but major victory over Seymour's troops at the [[Battle of Langfang]] on 18 June.{{sfn|Leonhard|p=18}}{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=ky4_whmgIZcC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49 49]}} As the allied European army retreated from Langfang, they were constantly fired upon by cavalry, and artillery bombarded their positions. It was reported that the Chinese artillery was superior to the European artillery, since the Europeans did not bother to bring along much for the campaign, thinking they could easily sweep through Chinese resistance.

The Europeans could not locate the Chinese artillery, which was raining shells upon their positions.&lt;ref name="smith1901"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WmAuAAAAYAAJ |title=China in convulsion |volume=2 |first=Arthur Henderson |last=Smith |year=1901 |publisher=F.

News arrived on 18 June regarding attacks on foreign legations. Seymour decided to continue advancing, this time along the Beihe river, toward [[Tongzhou, Hebei|Tongzhou]], {{convert|25|km}} from Beijing. By the 19th, they had to abandon their efforts due to progressively stiffening resistance and started to retreat southward along the river with over 200 wounded. Commandeering four civilian Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]] along the river, they loaded all their wounded and remaining supplies onto them and pulled them along with ropes from the riverbanks. By this point they were very low on food, ammunition and medical supplies. Unexpectedly they then happened upon [[The Great Hsi-Ku Arsenal|the Great Xigu Arsenal]], a hidden Qing munitions cache of which the Allied Powers had had no knowledge until then. They immediately captured and occupied it, discovering not only [[Krupp]] field guns, but rifles with millions of rounds of ammunition, along with millions of pounds of rice and ample medical supplies.

There they dug in and awaited rescue. A Chinese servant was able to infiltrate through the Boxer and Qing lines, informing the Eight Powers of the Seymour troops' predicament. Surrounded and attacked nearly around the clock by Qing troops and Boxers, they were at the point of being overrun. On 25 June, a regiment composed of 1,800 men (900 Russian troops from [[Lüshunkou|Port Arthur]], 500 British seamen, with an ad hoc mix of other assorted Alliance troops) finally arrived on foot from Tientsin to rescue Seymour. Spiking the mounted field guns and setting fire to any munitions that they could not take (an estimated £3&amp;nbsp;million worth), Seymour, his force, and the rescue mission marched back to Tientsin, unopposed, on 26 June. Seymour's casualties during the expedition were 62 killed and 228 wounded.{{sfnb|Preston|2000|p = 100-104}}

===Conflicting attitudes within the Qing imperial court===
[[File:Qing Imperial Army.jpg|thumb|Qing imperial soldiers during the Boxer Rebellion]]

Meanwhile, in Beijing, on 16 June, Empress Dowager Cixi summoned the imperial court for a mass audience and addressed the choices between using the Boxers to evict the foreigners from the city or seeking a diplomatic solution. In response to a high official who doubted the efficacy of the Boxers' magic, Cixi replied: Both sides of the debate at the imperial court realised that popular support for the Boxers in the countryside was almost universal and that suppression would be both difficult and unpopular, especially when foreign troops were on the march.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jVESdBSMasMC&amp;lpg=PA289 289–290]}}&lt;ref name="Purcell2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor Purcell|title=The Boxer Uprising: A Background Study|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2MeUoD9G9xAC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;q=cannot%20rely%20charms%20heart%20people%20lose|date=3 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-14812-2|pages=250–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two factions were active during this debate. On one side were anti-foreigners who viewed foreigners as invasive and imperialistic and evoked a nativist populism. They advocated taking advantage of the Boxers to achieve the expulsion of foreign troops and foreign influences. The pro-foreigners on the other hand advanced rapprochement with foreign governments, seeing the Boxers as superstitious and ignorant.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The event that tilted the Qing imperial government irrevocably toward support of the Boxers and war with the foreign powers was the attack of foreign navies on the [[Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)|Dagu Forts]] near Tianjin, on 17 June 1900.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Siege of the Beijing legations===
{{main|Siege of the International Legations}}
[[File:Western Legations Peking 1900 Clowes Vol VII.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.4|Locations of foreign diplomatic legations and front lines in Beijing during the siege]]

On 15 June, Qing imperial forces deployed electric [[Naval mine|mines]] in the [[Beihe River|River Beihe]] (Peiho) to prevent the Eight-Nation Alliance from sending ships to attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LYYLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA533|title=Reports on Military Operations in South Africa and China|authors=Stephan L'H.

With a difficult military situation in Tianjin and a total breakdown of communications between Tianjin and Beijing, the allied nations took steps to reinforce their military presence significantly. On 17 June they took the Dagu Forts commanding the approaches to Tianjin, and from there brought increasing numbers of troops on shore. When Cixi received an ultimatum{{when|date=February 2014}} demanding that China surrender total control over all its military and financial affairs to foreigners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Last Empress: The She-Dragon of China|author=Keith Laidler|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=221|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLPZ7294oSIC&amp;pg=PA221|isbn=0-470-86426-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; she defiantly stated before the entire [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]], "Now they [the Powers] have started the aggression, and the extinction of our nation is imminent. If we just fold our arms and yield to them, I would have no face to see our ancestors after death. If we must perish, why don't we fight to the death?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Boxer catastrophe|issue=Issue 583 of Columbia Studies in the Social Sciences|author=Chester C.

It was at this point that Cixi began to blockade the legations with the armies of the [[Peking Field Force]], which began the siege. Cixi stated that "I have always been of the opinion, that the allied armies had been permitted to escape too easily [[Second Opium War|in 1860]]. Only a united effort was then necessary to have given China the victory. Today, at last, the opportunity for revenge has come", and said that millions of Chinese would join the cause of fighting the foreigners since the Manchus had provided "great benefits" on China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit Soldiers: A Historical Narrative of the Boxer Rebellion|author=Richard O'Connor| year=1973|edition=illustrated| publisher=Putnam|page=85| url=https://books.google.com/?id=P4NxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=extinction+imminent}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On receipt of the news of the attack on the [[Dagu Fort]]s on the 19th of June, Empress Dowager Cixi immediately sent an order to the legations that the diplomats and other foreigners depart Beijing under escort of the Chinese army within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning, diplomats from the besieged legations met to discuss the Empress's offer. The majority quickly agreed that they could not trust the Chinese army. Fearing that they would be killed, they agreed to refuse the Empress's demand. The German Imperial Envoy, Baron Klemens Freiherr von Ketteler, was infuriated with the actions of the Chinese army troops and determined to take his complaints to the royal court. Against the advice of the fellow foreigners, the baron left the legations with a single aide and a team of porters to carry his sedan chair. On his way to the palace, von Ketteler was killed on the streets of Beijing by a Manchu captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Warriors of the Rising Sun: A History of the Japanese Military|author=Robert B.

At this news, the other diplomats feared they also would be murdered if they left the legation quarter and they chose to continue to defy the Chinese order to depart Beijing. The legations were hurriedly fortified. Most of the foreign civilians, which included a large number of missionaries and businessmen, took refuge in the British legation, the largest of the diplomatic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Preston, page 87, "A Brief History of the Boxer Rebellion", {{ISBN|1-84119-490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Christians were primarily housed in the adjacent palace (Fu) of Prince Su who was forced to abandon his property by the foreign soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Preston, page 79, "A Brief History of the Boxer Rebellion", {{ISBN|1-84119-490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 21st of June, Empress Dowager Cixi declared war against all foreign powers. Regional governors who commanded substantial modernised armies, such as [[Li Hongzhang]] at Canton, [[Yuan Shikai]] in Shandong, [[Zhang Zhidong]]&lt;ref name="Rhoads2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward J.

Yuan Shikai used his own forces to suppress Boxers in Shandong, and Zhang entered into negotiations with the foreigners in Shanghai to keep his army out of the conflict. The neutrality of these provincial and regional governors left the majority of Chinese out of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, ''The Rise of Modern China'' pp. 393–398.&lt;/ref&gt; They were called [[The Mutual Protection of Southeast China]].&lt;ref name="Luo2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zhitian Luo|title=Inheritance within Rupture: Culture and Scholarship in Early Twentieth Century China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avlyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|date=30 January 2015|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-28766-2|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legations of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United States, Russia and Japan were located in the [[Beijing Legation Quarter]] south of the [[Forbidden City]]. The Chinese army and Boxer irregulars besieged the Legation Quarter from 20 June to 14 August 1900. A total of 473 foreign civilians, 409 soldiers, marines and sailors from eight countries, and about 3,000 Chinese Christians took refuge there.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=84–85}} Under the command of the British minister to China, [[Claude Maxwell MacDonald]], the legation staff and military guards defended the compound with small arms, three machine guns, and one old muzzle-loaded cannon, which was nicknamed the ''International Gun'' because the barrel was British, the carriage Italian, the shells Russian and the crew American. Chinese Christians in the legations led the foreigners to the cannon and it proved important in the defence. Also under siege in Beijing was the [[Church of the Saviour, Beijing|Northern Cathedral]] (''Beitang'') of the Catholic Church. The Beitang was defended by 43 French and Italian soldiers, 33 Catholic foreign priests and nuns, and about 3,200 Chinese Catholics. The defenders suffered heavy casualties especially from lack of food and mines which the Chinese exploded in tunnels dug beneath the compound.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=85, 170–171}} The number of Chinese soldiers and Boxers besieging the Legation Quarter and the Beitang is unknown.

On the 22nd and 23 June, Chinese soldiers and Boxers set fire to areas north and west of the British Legation, using it as a "frightening tactic" to attack the defenders. The nearby [[Hanlin Academy]], a complex of courtyards and buildings that housed "the quintessence of Chinese scholarship ... the oldest and richest library in the world", caught fire. Each side blamed the other for the destruction of the invaluable books it contained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla62/62-davd.htm|title=Destruction of Chinese Books in the Peking Siege of 1900.

After the failure to burn out the foreigners, the Chinese army adopted an anaconda-like strategy. The Chinese built barricades surrounding the Legation Quarter and advanced, brick by brick, on the foreign lines, forcing the foreign legation guards to retreat a few feet at a time. This tactic was especially used in the Fu, defended by Japanese and Italian sailors and soldiers, and inhabited by most of the Chinese Christians. Fusillades of bullets, artillery and firecrackers were directed against the Legations almost every night—but did little damage. Sniper fire took its toll among the foreign defenders. Despite their numerical advantage, the Chinese did not attempt a direct assault on the Legation Quarter although in the words of one of the besieged, "it would have been easy by a strong, swift movement on the part of the numerous Chinese troops to have annihilated the whole body of foreigners ... in an hour."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Arthur H. ''China in Convulsion''. 2 vols. New York: Fleming H. Revell, 1901, pp. 316–317&lt;/ref&gt; American missionary [[Francis Dunlap Gamewell|Frank Gamewell]] and his crew of "fighting parsons" fortified the Legation Quarter,&lt;ref&gt;Weale, Putnam. ''Indiscreet Letters from Peking.'' New York: Dodd, Mead, 1907, pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt; but impressed Chinese Christians to do most of the physical labour of building defences.&lt;ref&gt;Payen, Cecile E. "Besieged in Peking." ''The Century Magazine'', January 1901, pp 458–460&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans and the Americans occupied perhaps the most crucial of all defensive positions: the Tartar Wall. Holding the top of the {{convert |45|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert |40|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide wall was vital. The German barricades faced east on top of the wall and {{convert |400|yd|m|abbr=on}} west were the west-facing American positions. The Chinese advanced toward both positions by building barricades even closer. "The men all feel they are in a trap", said the American commander, Capt. [[John Twiggs Myers|John T. Myers]], "and simply await the hour of execution."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Captain John T. "Military Operations and Defenses of the Siege of Peking." ''Proceedings of the U.S. Naval Institute'', September 1902, pp. 542–50.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June, the Chinese forced the Germans off the Wall, leaving the American Marines alone in its defence. At the same time, a Chinese barricade was advanced to within a few feet of the American positions and it became clear that the Americans had to abandon the wall or force the Chinese to retreat. At 2&amp;nbsp;am on 3 July, 56 British, Russian and American marines and sailors, under the command of Myers, launched an assault against the Chinese barricade on the wall. The attack caught the Chinese sleeping, killed about 20 of them, and expelled the rest of them from the barricades.&lt;ref&gt;Oliphant, Nigel, ''A Diary of the Siege of the Legations in Peking''. London: Longman, Greens, 1901, pp 78–80&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese did not attempt to advance their positions on the Tartar Wall for the remainder of the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, W.A.P. ''The Siege in Peking''. New York:Fleming H. Revell, 1900, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Claude MacDonald said 13 July was the "most harassing day" of the siege.{{sfnb|Fleming|1959|p=157–158}} The Japanese and Italians in the Fu were driven back to their last defence line. The Chinese detonated a mine beneath the French Legation pushing the French and Austrians out of most of the French Legation.{{sfnb|Fleming|1959|p=157–158}} On 16 July, the most capable British officer was killed and the journalist [[George Ernest Morrison]] was wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Peter and Macklin, Robert ''The Man who Died Twice: The Life and Adventures of Morrison of Peking''. Crow's Nest, Australia: Allen &amp; Unwin, 2005, pp 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; But American Minister [[Edwin Hurd Conger]] established contact with the Chinese government and on 17 July, an armistice was declared by the Chinese.{{sfnb|Conger|1909|p= 135}} More than 40% of the legation guards were dead or wounded. The motivation of the Chinese was probably the realization that an allied force of 20,000 men had landed in China and retribution for the siege was at hand.

===Officials and commanders at cross purposes===

The Manchu General [[Ronglu]] concluded that it was futile to fight all of the powers simultaneously, and declined to press home the siege.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997| p= 54}} The Manchu [[Zaiyi]] (Prince Duan), an anti-foreign friend of [[Dong Fuxiang]], wanted artillery for Dong's troops to destroy the legations.

They issued edicts ordering the foreigners to be protected, but the Gansu warriors ignored it, and fought against Bannermen who tried to force them away from the legations. The Boxers also took commands from Dong Fuxiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Md801mHEeOkC&amp;pg=PA124 |title=Modern Chinese warfare, 1795–1989 |author=Bruce A.

The Decree ordered him to stop fighting the Boxers because of the foreign invasion, and also because the population was suffering. Due to Ronglu's actions, General Nie continued to fight the Boxers and killed many of them even as the foreign troops were making their way into China. Ronglu also ordered Nie to protect foreigners and save the railway from the Boxers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lAxresT12ogC&amp;pg=PA235|title=The origins of the Boxer War: a multinational study|author=Lanxin Xiang|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|page=235|isbn=0-7007-1563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because parts of the Railway were saved under Ronglu's orders, the foreign invasion army was able to transport itself into China quickly. General Nie committed thousands of troops against the Boxers instead of against the foreigners. Nie was already outnumbered by the Allies by 4,000 men. General Nie was blamed for attacking the Boxers, as Ronglu let Nie take all the blame. At the [[Battle of Tientsin|Battle of Tianjin (Tientsin)]], General Nie decided to sacrifice his life by walking into the range of Allied guns.{{sfnb|Elliott|2002|p = 499}}

[[File:BoxerSoldiers.jpg|thumb|left|Boxer rebels]]

[[Xu Jingcheng]], who had served as the Qing Envoy to many of the same states under siege in the Legation Quarter, argued that "the evasion of extraterritorial rights and the killing of foreign diplomats are unprecedented in China and abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=趙爾巽等撰 |year=1976 |title=Qing shi gao |last3=Zhao |first3=Erxun |author2=趙爾巽 |publisher=新華書店北京發行所發行,&lt;/span&gt; Beijing |oclc=17045858| ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xu and five other officials urged Empress Dowager Cixi to order the repression of Boxers, the execution of their leaders, and a diplomatic settlement with foreign armies. The Empress Dowager, outraged, sentenced Xu and the five others to death for "willfully and absurdly petitioning the Imperial Court" and "building subversive thought." They were executed on July 28, 1900 and their severed heads placed on display at [[Caishikou Execution Grounds]] in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.ihp.sinica.edu.tw/ttscgi/ttsquery?0:0:mctauac:TM%3D%B3%5C%B4%BA%BC%E1|title=資料連結|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dong Fuxiang.jpg|thumb|upright|Han Chinese General [[Dong Fuxiang]] was overtly hostile to foreigners and his "Gansu Braves" relentlessly attacked the besieged legations.]]

Reflecting this vacillation, some Chinese soldiers were quite liberally firing at foreigners under siege from its very onset. Cixi did not personally order imperial troops to conduct a siege, and on the contrary had ordered them to protect the foreigners in the legations. Prince Duan led the Boxers to loot his enemies within the imperial court and the foreigners, although imperial authorities expelled Boxers after they were let into the city and went on a looting rampage against both the foreign and the Qing imperial forces. Older Boxers were sent outside Beijing to halt the approaching foreign armies, while younger men were absorbed into the Muslim Gansu army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNPFc7kkjwAC&amp;pg=PA88|title=Imperial masquerade: the legend of Princess Der Ling|author=Grant Hayter-Menzies |year=2008|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|page=88|isbn=962-209-881-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With conflicting allegiances and priorities motivating the various forces inside Beijing, the situation in the city became increasingly confused. The foreign legations continued to be surrounded by both Qing imperial and Gansu forces. While Dong Fuxiang's Gansu army, now swollen by the addition of the Boxers, wished to press the siege, Ronglu's imperial forces seem to have largely attempted to follow Empress Dowager Cixi's decree and protect the legations. However, to satisfy the conservatives in the imperial court, Ronglu's men also fired on the legations and let off firecrackers to give the impression that they, too, were attacking the foreigners.

The Alliance discovered large amounts of unused Chinese Krupp artillery and shells after the siege was lifted.{{sfnb|Fleming|1959|p = 226}}

The armistice, although occasionally broken, endured until 13 August when, with an allied army led by the British [[Alfred Gaselee]] approaching Beijing to relieve the siege, the Chinese launched their heaviest fusillade on the Legation Quarter. As the foreign army approached, Chinese forces melted away.

===Gaselee Expedition===
{{Boxer Rebellion}}
{{main|Eight-Nation Alliance|Gaselee Expedition}}

Foreign navies started building up their presence along the northern China coast from the end of April 1900. Several international forces were sent to the capital, with varying success, and the Chinese forces were ultimately defeated by the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] of [[Austria-Hungary]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], [[Imperial Japan|Japan]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Independent of the alliance, the [[Netherlands]] dispatched three cruisers in July to protect its citizens in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor-last = Nordholt| editor-first = J. W.

British Lieutenant-General [[Alfred Gaselee]] acted as the commanding officer of the Eight-Nation Alliance, which eventually numbered 55,000. The main contingent was composed of Japanese (20,840), Russian (13,150), British (12,020), French (3,520), U.S. (3,420), German (900), Italian (80), Austro-Hungarian (75) and anti-Boxer Chinese troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russojapanesewar.com/boxers.html |title=Russojapanesewarweb |publisher=Russojapanesewar.com |date=1 July 1902 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "First Chinese Regiment" ([[Weihaiwei Regiment]]) which was praised for its performance, consisted of Chinese collaborators serving in the British military.&lt;ref name="Powell2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph L.

Notable events included the seizure of the [[Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)|Dagu Forts]] commanding the approaches to Tianjin and the boarding and capture of four Chinese destroyers by British Commander [[Roger John Brownlow Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Roger Keyes]]. Among the foreigners besieged in Tianjin was a young American mining engineer named [[Herbert Hoover]], who would go on to become the 31st President of the United States.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=96}}&lt;ref name=Hoover&gt;Hoover, Herbert C.

[[File:CaptureTianjin.jpg|thumb|The capture of the southern gate of Tianjin. British troops were positioned on the left, Japanese troops at the centre, French troops on the right.]]

The march from Tianjin to Beijing of about 120&amp;nbsp;km included about 20,000 allied troops. On 4 August, there were approximately 70,000 Qing imperial troops and anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 Boxers along the way. The allies only encountered minor resistance, fighting battles at [[Battle of Beicang|Beicang]] and [[Battle of Yangcun|Yangcun]]. At Yangcun, the [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|14th Infantry Regiment]] of the U.S. and British troops led the assault. The weather was a major obstacle. Conditions were extremely humid with temperatures sometimes reaching {{convert|42|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. These high temperatures and insects plagued the Allies. Soldiers dehydrated and horses died. Chinese villagers killed Allied troops who searched for wells.{{sfnb|Edgerton|1997|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=wkHyjjbv-yEC 88]}}

The heat killed Allied soldiers, who foamed at the mouth. The tactics along the way were gruesome on either side. Allied soldiers beheaded already dead Chinese corpses, bayoneted or beheaded live Chinese civilians, and raped Chinese girls and women.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5K9BN96p1hcC&amp;pg=PA168 168]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cossacks were reported to have killed Chinese civilians almost automatically and Japanese kicked a Chinese soldier to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edgerton|1997|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wkHyjjbv-yEC&amp;pg=PA89 87, 89]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese responded to the Alliance's atrocities with similar acts of violence and cruelty, especially towards captured Russians.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Lieutenant [[Smedley Butler]] saw the remains of two Japanese soldiers nailed to a wall, who had their tongues cut off and their eyes gouged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edgerton|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wkHyjjbv-yEC&amp;pg=PA88 88]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Butler was wounded during the expedition in the leg and chest, later receiving the Brevet Medal in recognition for his actions.

[[File:Chinese Soldiers 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese troops wearing modern uniforms in 1900]]

The international force reached Beijing on 14 August. Following the defeat of Beiyang army in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the Chinese government had invested heavily in modernizing the imperial army, which was equipped with modern [[Mauser]] repeater rifles and [[Krupp]] artillery. Three modernized divisions consisting of Manchu [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] protected the Beijing Metropolitan region. Two of them were under the command of the anti-Boxer [[Yikuang, Prince Qing|Prince Qing]] and Ronglu, while the anti-foreign Prince Duan commanded the ten-thousand-strong [[Hushenying]], or "Tiger Spirit Division", which had joined the Gansu Braves and Boxers in attacking the foreigners. It was a Hushenying captain who had assassinated the German diplomat Ketteler. The Tenacious Army under Nie Shicheng received western style training under German and Russian officers in addition to their modernised weapons and uniforms. They effectively resisted the Alliance at the [[Battle of Tientsin]] before retreating and astounded the Alliance forces with the accuracy of their artillery during the siege of the Tianjin concessions (the artillery shells failed to explode upon impact due to corrupt manufacturing). The Gansu Braves under Dong Fuxiang, which some sources described as "ill disciplined", were armed with modern weapons but were not trained according to western drill and wore traditional Chinese uniforms. They led the defeat of the Alliance at Langfang in the Seymour Expedition and were the most ferocious in besieging the Legations in Beijing. Some [[Eight Banner|Banner]] forces were given modernised weapons and western training, becoming the Metropolitan Banner forces, which were decimated in the fighting. Among the Manchu dead was the father of the writer [[Lao She]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The British won the race among the international forces to be the first to reach the besieged Legation Quarter. The U.S. was able to play a role due to the presence of U.S. ships and troops stationed in [[Manila]] since the U.S. conquest of the Philippines during the [[Spanish–American War]] and the subsequent [[Philippine–American War]]. In the U.S. military, the action in the Boxer Rebellion was known as the [[China Relief Expedition]]. [[United States Marines]] scaling the walls of Beijing is an iconic image of the Boxer Rebellion.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=177}}

The British Army reached the legation quarter on the afternoon of 14 August and relieved the Legation Quarter. The Beitang was relieved on 16 August, first by Japanese soldiers and then, officially, by the French.{{sfnb|Fleming|1959|p=220–221}}

===Evacuation of the Qing imperial court from Beijing to Xi'an===
[[File:BoxerTroops.jpg|thumb|Painting of Western and Japanese troops]]

In the early hours of 15 August, just as the Foreign Legations were being relieved, Empress Dowager Cixi, dressed in the padded blue cotton of a farm woman, the Guangxu Emperor, and a small retinue climbed into three wooden ox carts and escaped from the city covered with rough blankets. Legend has it that the Empress Dowager then either ordered that the Guangxu Emperor's favourite concubine, [[Consort Zhen]], be thrown down a well in the Forbidden City or tricked her into drowning herself. The journey was made all the more arduous by the lack of preparation, but the Empress Dowager insisted this was not a retreat, rather a "tour of inspection." After weeks of travel, the party arrived in [[Xi'an]] in [[Shaanxi]] province, beyond protective mountain passes where the foreigners could not reach, deep in Chinese Muslim territory and protected by the Gansu Braves. The foreigners had no orders to pursue the Empress Dowager, so they decided to stay put.{{sfnb|Preston|2000|pp=253–261}}

==Russian invasion of Manchuria==
[[File:Russian soldiers during the boxer rebellion.jpg|left|thumb|Russian officers in Manchuria during the Boxer Rebellion]]

The Russian Empire and the Qing Empire had maintained a long peace, starting with the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] in 1689, but Tsarist forces took advantage of Chinese defeats to impose the [[Aigun Treaty]] of 1858 and the [[Treaty of Peking]] of 1860 which ceded formerly Chinese territory in Manchuria to Russia, much of which is held by Russia to the present day ([[Primorye]]). The Russians aimed for control over the [[Amur River]] for navigation, and the all-weather ports of [[Dairen]] and [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]] in the [[Liaodong]] peninsula. The rise of Japan as an Asian power provoked Russia's anxiety, especially in light of expanding Japanese influence in [[Korea]]. Following Japan's victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1895, the [[Triple Intervention]] of Russia, Germany and France forced Japan to return the territory won in Liaodong, leading to a de facto Sino-Russian alliance.

Local Chinese in Manchuria were incensed at these Russian advances and began to harass Russians and Russian institutions, such as the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]]. In June 1900, the Chinese bombarded the town of [[Blagoveshchensk]] on the Russian side of the Amur. The Czar's government used the pretext of Boxer activity to move some 200,000 troops into the area to [[Crushing of boxers in Northern and Central Manchuria|crush the Boxers]]. The Chinese used arson to destroy a bridge carrying a railway and a barracks on 27 July. The [[Boxers attacks on Chinese Eastern Railway|Boxers destroyed railways and cut lines for telegraphs]] and burned the Yantai mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HvhEAAAAIAAJ|title=The Russo-Chinese War|author=George Alexander Lensen|year=1967|publisher=Diplomatic Press|page=14|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 21 September, Russian troops took [[Jilin]] and Liaodong, and by the end of the month completely occupied Manchuria, where their presence was a major factor leading to the [[Russo-Japanese War]].

The Chinese [[Honghuzi]] bandits of Manchuria, who had fought alongside the Boxers in the war, did not stop when the Boxer rebellion was over, and continued guerilla warfare against the Russian occupation up to the [[Russo-Japanese war]] when the Russians were defeated by Japan.

==Massacre of missionaries and Chinese Christians==
[[File:Chinese Martirs.jpg|thumb|The [[Chinese Martyrs|Holy Chinese Martyrs]] of the [[Orthodox Church]] as depicted in an [[icon]] commissioned in 1990]]

Orthodox, Protestant, and Catholic missionaries and their Chinese parishioners were massacred throughout northern China, some by Boxers and others by government troops and authorities. After the declaration of war on Western powers in June 1900, Yuxian, who had been named governor of [[Shanxi]] in March of that year, implemented a brutal anti-foreign and anti-Christian policy. On 9 July, reports circulated that he had executed forty-four foreigners (including women and children) from missionary families whom he had invited to the provincial capital [[Taiyuan]] under the promise to protect them.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p= 51}}{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|pp= 190–191}} Although the purported [[Witness|eye witness]] accounts have recently been questioned as improbable, this event became a notorious symbol of Chinese anger, known as the [[Taiyuan Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger R. Thompson,  "Reporting the Taiyuan Massacre: Culture and Politics in the China War of 1900", in Robert A. Bickers and R. G. Tiedemann, ed., ''The Boxers, China, and the World'' (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007): 65–92. Thompson points out that the widely circulated accounts were by people who could not have seen the events and that these accounts closely followed (often word for word) well known earlier martyr literature.&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer's end, more foreigners and as many as 2,000 Chinese Christians had been put to death in the province. Journalist and historical writer Nat Brandt has called the massacre of Christians in Shanxi "the greatest single tragedy in the history of Christian evangelicalism."&lt;ref&gt;Nat Brandt, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R0GGv-Dio1MC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22massacre%20in%20shansi%22&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;pg=PR13 Massacre in Shansi]'', Syracuse University Press, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Boxer Rebellion as a whole, a total of 136 Protestant missionaries and 53 children were killed, and 47 Catholic priests and nuns. 30,000 Chinese Catholics, 2,000 Chinese Protestants, and 200 to 400 of the 700 Russian Orthodox Christians in Beijing were estimated to have been killed. Collectively, the Protestant dead were called the [[China Martyrs of 1900]].{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 184}} 222 of Russian Christian [[Chinese Martyrs]] including [[Metrophanes, Chi Sung|St. Metrophanes]] were [[canonization|locally canonised]] as [[New Martyrs]] on 22 April 1902, after [[archimandrite]] Innocent (Fugurovsky), head of the Russian Orthodox Mission in China, solicited the [[Most Holy Synod]] to perpetuate their memory. This was the first local canonisation for more than two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azbyka.ru/tserkov/svyatye/trubachev_kanonizatsiya_svyatyh_07-all.shtml|script-title=ru:Канонизация святых в Русской Православной Церкви – 5.

Beijing, Tianjin, and other cities in northern China were occupied for more than one year by the international expeditionary force under the command of German General [[Alfred von Waldersee|Alfred Graf von Waldersee]]. Atrocities by foreign troops were common. French troops ravaged the countryside around Beijing on behalf of Chinese Catholics. The Americans and British paid General [[Yuan Shikai]] and his army (the [[New Army|Right Division]]) to help the Eight Nation Alliance suppress the Boxers. Yuan Shikai's forces killed tens of thousands of people in their anti Boxer campaign in [[Zhili Province]] and [[Shandong]] after the Alliance captured Beijing.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Warriors of the Rising Sun: A History of the Japanese Military|author=Edgerton, R.B.|date=1997|publisher=Norton|isbn=9780393040852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wkHyjjbv-yEC&amp;pg=PA94|page=94|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuan operated out of [[Baoding]] during the campaign, which ended in 1902.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Yuan Shih-kʻai|author=Ch?ên, J.|date=1972|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804707893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_W-mAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA76|page=76|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Li Hongzhang]] commanded Chinese soldiers to kill "Boxers" to assist the foreign invaders.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Kocvarp., [https://otik.uk.zcu.cz/bitstream/handle/11025/17656/Kocvar.pdf?sequence=1 Germany and the Boxer Uprising in China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311030127/https://otik.uk.zcu.cz/bitstream/handle/11025/17656/Kocvar.pdf?sequence=1 |date=11 March 2016 }}  ''West Bohemian Historical Review'' Vol. 5.2 2015, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Chinese point of view, as well as reports from contemporary Western observers, German, Russian, and Japanese troops received the greatest criticism for their ruthlessness and willingness to wantonly execute Chinese of all ages and backgrounds, sometimes burning and killing entire village populations.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Paul A. ''History In Three Keys: The Boxers As Event, Experience, and Myth'', Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0231106505}} (1997), pp. 185-185&lt;/ref&gt; The German force arrived too late to take part in the fighting, but undertook punitive expeditions to the countryside. Kaiser Wilhelm II on July 27 during departure ceremonies for the German relief force included an impromptu, but intemperate reference to the [[Hun]] invaders of continental Europe which would later be resurrected by British propaganda to mock Germany during the First World War and Second World War:

::Should you encounter the enemy, he will be defeated! No quarter will be given! Prisoners will not be taken! Whoever falls into your hands is forfeited. Just as a thousand years ago the Huns under their King Attila made a name for themselves, one that even today makes them seem mighty in history and legend, may the name German be affirmed by you in such a way in China that no Chinese will ever again dare to look cross-eyed at a German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilhelm II: "Hun Speech" (1900) ''German History in Documents and Images'' (GHDI) |url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=755 |publisher=germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One newspaper called the aftermath of the siege a "carnival of loot", and others called it "an orgy of looting" by soldiers, civilians and missionaries. These characterisations called to mind the [[Old Summer Palace#Destruction|sacking of the Summer Palace in 1860]].&lt;ref&gt;James L. Hevia, "Looting and Its Discontents: Moral Discourse and the Plunder of Beijing, 1900–1901", in Bickers and Tiedemann, ed., ''The Boxers, China, and the World'' (2007): 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Each nationality accused the others of being the worst looters. An American diplomat, [[Herbert G. Squiers]], filled several railroad cars with loot. The British Legation held loot auctions every afternoon and proclaimed, "looting on the part of British troops was carried out in the most orderly manner." However, one British officer noted, "it is one of the unwritten [[laws of war]] that a city which does not surrender at the last and is taken by storm is looted." For the rest of 1900–1901, the British held loot auctions everyday except Sunday in front of the main-gate to the British Legation. Many foreigners, including [[Claude Maxwell MacDonald|Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald]] and Lady Ethel MacDonald and [[George Ernest Morrison]] of ''[[The Times]]'', were active bidders among the crowd. Many of these looted items ended up in Europe.{{sfnb|Preston|2000|p = 284-285}} The Catholic [[Xishiku Cathedral|Beitang]] or North Cathedral was a "salesroom for stolen property."&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, Wilbur J. letter to his wife (11 December 1900), in ''Ordered to China: Letters of Wilbur J. Chamberlin: Written from China While Under Commission from the New York Sun During the Boxer Uprising of 1900 and the International Complications Which Followed,'' (New York: Frederick A. Stokes, 1903), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
The American commander General [[Adna Chaffee]] banned looting by American soldiers, but the ban was ineffectual.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 194-197}}

Some, but by no means all Western missionaries took an active part in calling for retribution. To provide restitution to missionaries and Chinese Christian families whose property had been destroyed, [[William Scott Ament|William Ament]], a missionary of [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], guided American troops through villages to punish those he suspected of being Boxers and confiscate their property. When [[Mark Twain]] read of this expedition, he wrote a scathing essay, [[s:To the Person Sitting in Darkness|"To the Person Sitting in Darkness"]] that attacked the "Reverend bandits of the American Board,"  especially targeting Ament, one of the most respected missionaries in China.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 207-208 }}  The controversy was front-page news during much of 1901. Ament's counterpart on the distaff side was doughty British missionary Georgina Smith who presided over a neighborhood in Beijing as judge and jury.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 204-214}}

While one historical account reported that Japanese troops were astonished by other Alliance troops raping civilians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XtmzFZS_SX0C&amp;pg=PA301|title=East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History|author1=Patricia Ebrey |author2=Anne Walthall |author3=James Palais |year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=301|isbn=0-547-00534-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; others noted that Japanese troops were 'looting and burning without mercy', and that Chinese 'women and girls by hundreds have committed suicide to escape a worse fate at the hands of Russian and Japanese brutes.'&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Paul A., ''History In Three Keys: The Boxers As Event, Experience, and Myth'', Columbia University Press (1997), {{ISBN|0231106505}}, pp. 184&lt;/ref&gt;  Roger Keyes, who commanded the British destroyer ''[[HMS Fame (1896)|Fame]]'' and accompanied the Gaselee Expedition, noted that the Japanese had brought their own "regimental wives" (prostitutes) to the front to keep their soldiers from raping Chinese civilians.{{sfnb|Preston|2000|p =90, 284–285}} Thousands of Chinese women committed suicide; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' journalist E. J. Dillon stated it was to avoid rape by Alliance forces, and he witnessed the mutilated corpses of Chinese women who were raped and killed by the Alliance troops. The French commander dismissed the rapes, attributing them to "gallantry of the French soldier." A foreign journalist, George Lynch, said "there are things that I must not write, and that may not be printed in England, which would seem to show that this Western civilization of ours is merely a veneer over savagery."{{sfnb|Preston|2000|p = 284-285}}

Many [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] supported the Boxers and shared their anti-foreign sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NUTE8V-WhwoC&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Crossley 1990], p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;  The German Minister [[Clemens von Ketteler]] was assassinated by a Manchu.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QiM2pF5PDR8C&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Rhoads 2000], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Bannermen had been devastated in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895 and Banner armies were destroyed while resisting the invasion.

Under the lead of some highly ranked officials including [[Li Hongzhang]], [[Yuan Shikai]] and [[Zhang Zhidong]], several provinces in the southeast formed the [[The Mutual Protection of Southeast China|Southeastern Mutual Protection]] during this period to avoid the further expansion of the chaos or the worsening of the situation between China and western powers. These provinces claimed to be neutral and refused to fight either the Boxers or the [[Eight Nation Alliance]].

===Reparations===
After the capture of Peking by the foreign armies, some of Empress Dowager Cixi's advisers advocated that the war be carried on, arguing that China could have defeated the foreigners as it was disloyal and traitorous people within China who allowed Beijing and Tianjin to be captured by the Allies, and that the interior of China was impenetrable. They also recommended that Dong Fuxiang continue fighting. The Empress Dowager Cixi was practical, however, and decided that the terms were generous enough for her to acquiesce when she was assured of her continued reign after the war and that China would not be forced to cede any territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWxKQejMtlMC&amp;pg=PA312|title=The Boxer Rebellion: The Dramatic Story of China's War on Foreigners that Shook the World in the Summer of 1900|author=Diana Preston|year=2000|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|page=312|isbn=0-8027-1361-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September 1901, the Qing imperial court agreed to sign the "[[Boxer Protocol]]" also known as Peace Agreement between the Eight-Nation Alliance and China. The protocol ordered the execution of 10 high-ranking officials linked to the outbreak and other officials who were found guilty for the slaughter of foreigners in China. [[Alfons Mumm von Schwarzenstein|Alfons Mumm]] (Freiherr von Schwarzenstein), [[Ernest Satow]] and [[Komura Jutaro]] signed on behalf of Germany, Britain and Japan, respectively.

China was fined [[war reparations]] of 450,000,000 [[tael]]s of fine silver (≈{{convert|540000000|ozt|t}} @ 1.2&amp;nbsp;ozt/tael) for the loss that it caused. The reparation was to be paid within 39 years, and would be 982,238,150 taels with interest (4 percent per year) included. To help meet the payment it was agreed to increase the existing tariff from an actual 3.18 percent to 5 percent, and to tax hitherto duty-free merchandise. The sum of reparation was estimated by the Chinese population (roughly 450&amp;nbsp;million in 1900), to let each Chinese pay one tael. Chinese custom income and salt tax were enlisted as guarantee of the reparation. China paid 668,661,220 taels of silver from 1901 to 1939, equivalent in 2010 to ≈US$61&amp;nbsp;billion on a purchasing power parity basis.&lt;ref name="Hsu, 481"&gt;Hsu, 481&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of the reparations paid to the United States was diverted to pay for the education of Chinese students in U.S. universities under the [[Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program]]. To prepare the students chosen for this program an institute was established to teach the English language and to serve as a preparatory school. When the first of these students returned to China they undertook the teaching of subsequent students; from this institute was born [[Tsinghua University]]. Some of the reparation due to Britain was later earmarked for a similar program.

The [[China Inland Mission]] lost more members than any other missionary agency:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/martyredmission02broogoog |title=Archive.org |publisher=Archive.org |date=10 March 2001 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
58 adults and 21 children were killed. However, in 1901, when the allied nations were demanding compensation from the Chinese government, [[Hudson Taylor]] refused to accept payment for loss of property or life in order to demonstrate the meekness and gentleness of Christ to the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Broomhall (1901), several pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian Catholic vicar apostolic of Ordos, Msgr. Alfons Bermyn wanted foreign troops garrisoned in [[Christianity in Inner Mongolia|Inner Mongolia]], but the Governor refused.

==Long-term consequences==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
The European great powers finally ceased their ambitions of colonizing China having learned from the Boxer rebellions that the best way to deal with China was through the ruling dynasty, rather than directly with the Chinese people (a sentiment embodied in the adage: "The people are afraid of officials, the officials are afraid of foreigners, and the foreigners are afraid of the people" ({{zh|c=老百姓怕官，官怕洋鬼子，洋鬼子怕老百姓|labels=no}}), and even briefly assisted the Qing in their war against the Japanese to prevent a Japanese domination in the region.

[[File:French China medal 1900 1901.jpg|thumb|French [[1901 China expedition commemorative medal]]. [[Musée de la Légion d'Honneur]]]]

Concurrently, this period marks the ceding of European great power interference in Chinese affairs, with the Japanese replacing the Europeans as the dominant power for their lopsided involvement in the war against the Boxers as well as their victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. With the toppling of the Qing that followed and the rise of the Nationalist [[Kuomintang]], European sway within China was reduced to symbolic status. After taking Manchuria in 1905, Japan came to dominate Asian affairs both militarily and culturally with many of the Chinese scholars also educated in Japan with the most prominent example being [[Sun Yat-Sen]] who would later found the Nationalist movement of the [[Kuomintang]] in China.

In October 1900, Russia occupied the provinces of Manchuria,&lt;ref name="Paine1996"&gt;{{cite book|first1=S. C. M.|last1=Paine|title=Imperial Rivals: China, Russia, and Their Disputed Frontier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMrx5Rw5n0AC|year=1996|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-1-56324-724-8|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; a move which threatened [[Anglo-American relations|Anglo-American]] hopes of maintaining what remained of China's territorial integrity and the country's openness to commerce under the [[Open Door Policy]].

Japan's clash with Russia over Liaodong and other provinces in eastern Manchuria, due to the Russian refusal to honour the terms of the Boxer protocol which called for their withdrawal, led to the [[Russo-Japanese War]] when two years of negotiations broke down in February 1904. The Russian Lease of the Liaodong (1898) was confirmed. Russia was ultimately defeated by an increasingly confident Japan.

Besides the compensation, [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] reluctantly started some reforms despite her previous views. Under her reforms known as the [[New Policies]] started in 1901, the [[imperial examination]] system for government service was eliminated and as a result the system of [[Chinese classic texts|education through Chinese classics]] was replaced with a [[Liberal arts|European liberal system]] that led to a university degree. Along with the formation of new military and police organisations, the reforms also simplified central bureaucracy and made a start on revamping taxation policies.&lt;ref name="Benedict1996"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Carol Ann|last1=Benedict|title=Bubonic Plague in Nineteenth-Century China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxa7jcVIR9MC|year=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2661-0|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the deaths of Cixi and the [[Guangxu Emperor]] in 1908, the [[prince regent]] [[Zaifeng, Prince Chun|Zaifeng (Prince Chun)]], the Guangxu Emperor's brother, launched further reforms.

The effect on China was a weakening of the dynasty and its national defense capabilities. The government structure was temporarily sustained by the Europeans. Behind the international conflict, it further deepened internal ideological differences between northern-Chinese anti-foreign royalists and southern-Chinese anti-Qing revolutionists. This scenario in the last years of the Qing dynasty gradually escalated into a chaotic [[warlord era]] in which the most powerful northern warlords were hostile towards the revolutionaries in the south who overthrew the Qing monarchy in 1911. The rivalry was not fully resolved until the northern warlords were defeated by the [[Kuomintang]]'s 1926–28 [[Northern Expedition]]. Prior to the final defeat of the Boxer Rebellion, all anti-Qing movements in the previous century, such as the [[Taiping Rebellion]], had been successfully suppressed by the Qing.

Historian [[Walter LaFeber]] has argued that President [[William McKinley]]'s decision to send 5,000 American troops to quell the rebellion marks "the origins of modern presidential war powers":&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Woods|Woods, Thomas]] (7 July 2005) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/woods/woods45.html Presidential War Powers], [[LewRockwell.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

::McKinley took a historic step in creating a new, 20th century presidential power. He dispatched the five thousand troops without consulting Congress, let alone obtaining a declaration of war, to fight the Boxers who were supported by the Chinese government ... Presidents had previously used such force against non-governmental groups that threatened U.S. interests and citizens. It was now used, however, against recognised governments, and without obeying the [[War Powers Clause|Constitution's provisions about who was to declare war]].

[[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] concurred, writing that:&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.|Schlesinger, Arthur]]. ''[[The Imperial Presidency]]'' (Popular Library 1974), pg. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

::The intervention in China marked the start of a crucial shift in the presidential employment of armed force overseas. In the 19th century, military force committed without congressional authorization had been typically used against nongovernmental organizations. Now it was beginning to be used against sovereign states, and, in the case of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], with less consultation than ever.

In the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], when the Japanese asked the Muslim general [[Ma Hongkui]] to defect and become head of a Muslim puppet state, he responded that his relatives had been killed during the Battle of Peking, including his uncle [[Ma Fulu]]. Since Japanese troops made up the majority of the Alliance forces there would be no cooperation with the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=LEI |first=Wan |date=February 2010 |title=The Chinese Islamic "Goodwill Mission to the Middle East" During the Anti-Japanese War |url=https://www.academia.edu/4427135/The_Chinese_Islamic_Goodwill_Mission_to_the_Middle_East_-_Japonyaya_Karsi_Savasta_Cinli_Muslumanlarin_Orta_Dogu_iyi_Niyet_Heyeti_-_Wan_LEI |journal=DÎvÂn Disiplinlerarasi Çalismalar Dergisi |volume=cilt 15 |issue=sayı 29 |pages=133–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and changing views of the Boxers==
[[File:Boxer Prisoners Captured By 6th US Cavalry, Tientsin, China (1901) Underwood &amp; Co (RESTORED) (4072872709).jpg|thumb|right|Boxers captured by the U.S. Army near Tianjin in 1901]]

From the beginning, views differed as to whether the Boxers were better seen as anti-imperialist, patriotic, and proto-nationalist or as "uncivilized", irrational, and futile opponents of inevitable change. The historian Joseph Esherick comments that "confusion about the Boxer Uprising is not simply a matter of popular misconceptions", for "there is no major incident in China's modern history on which the range of professional interpretation is as great".{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p= xiv }}

Chinese liberals such as [[Hu Shih|Hu Shi]] often condemned the Boxers for their irrationality and barbarity.&lt;ref&gt;顾则徐：清末民初思想领袖评价义和团总览&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]], the founding father of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] Party at first believed that the Boxer Movement was stirred up by the Qing government's rumors, which "caused confusion among the populace", and delivered "scathing criticism" of the Boxers' "anti-foreignism and obscurantism". Sun praised the Boxers for their "spirit of resistance" but called them "bandits". Students shared an ambivalent attitude to the Boxers, stating that while the uprising originated from the "ignorant and stubborn people of the interior areas", their beliefs were "brave and righteous", and could "be transformed into a moving force for independence".&lt;ref name="Han 20, 21"&gt;{{cite book|last=Han|first=Xiaorong |title=Chinese discourses on the peasant, 1900–1949 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oxTe1YYZa7MC&amp;pg=PA20|date=February 2005|publisher= State University of New York Press|isbn=0791463192|pages=20, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, nationalist Chinese became more sympathetic to the Boxers. In 1918 Sun praised their fighting spirit and said the Boxers were courageous and fearless, fighting to the death against the Alliance armies, specifically the [[Battle of Yangcun]].&lt;ref&gt;Sun Yat-sen, A Letter to the Governor of Hong Kong", quoted in Li Weichao, "Modern Chinese Nationalism and the Boxer Movement",  {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I0kvN9LDHP0C&amp;pg=PA151|title=Critical Zone 3: A Forum of Chinese and Western Knowledge|author=Douglas Kerr|year=2009|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|pages=149, 151|isbn=962-209-857-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the [[New Culture Movement]], [[Chen Duxiu]], forgave the "barbarism of the Boxer... given the crime foreigners committed in China", and contended that it was those "subservient to the foreigners" that truly "deserved our resentment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Han|first=Xiaorong |title=Chinese discourses on the peasant, 1900–1949 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxTe1YYZa7MC&amp;pg=PA59|date=February 2005|publisher= State University of New York Press|isbn=  0791463192|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, views of the Boxers were complex and contentious. [[Mark Twain]] said that "the Boxer is a patriot. He loves his country better than he does the countries of other people. I wish him success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Twain|first=Mark |title=Mark Twain Speeches |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dhWMWs_7J3UC&amp;pg=PA116|date=7 November 2007|publisher=|isbn=978-1-4346-7879-9|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian writer [[Leo Tolstoy]] also praised the Boxers. He accused Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm II of Germany of being chiefly responsible for the lootings, rapes, murders and the "Christian brutality" of the Russians and other western troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=k1_iAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=he+praised+the+Chinese+for+their+heroic+patience.+When+he+learned+about+the+%22orgy+of+murder,+raping,+and+looting%22+committed+by+the+Western+powers+in+quelling+the+Boxer+rebellion,+he+raged+against+the+brutality+of+the+Christians|title=The Russian review, Volume 19|author=William Henry Chamberlin |year=1960|publisher=Blackwell|page=115|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]] mocked the Russian government's claim that it was protecting [[Christian civilization]]: "Poor Imperial Government!

Even some American churchmen spoke out in support of the Boxers. The evangelist Rev. Dr. [[George F. Pentecost]] said that the Boxer uprising was a "patriotic movement to expel the 'foreign devils' — just that — the foreign devils". Suppose, he said, the great nations of Europe were to “put their fleets together, came over here, seize Portland, move on down to Boston, then New York, then Philadelphia, and so on down the Atlantic Coast and around the Gulf of Galveston? Suppose they took possession of these port cities, drove our people into the hinterland, built great warehouses and factories, brought in a body of dissolute agents, and calmly notified our people that henceforward they would manage the commerce of the country? Would we not have a Boxer movement to drive those foreign European Christian devils out of our country?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=11 February 1912 |title=

[[File:Boxer1900.jpg|upright|thumb|A Boxer during the revolt]]

The Russian newspaper ''Amurskii Krai'' criticized the killing of innocent civilians, charging that "restraint" "civilization" and "culture" instead of "racial hatred" and "destruction" would have been more becoming of a "civilized Christian nation". The paper asked "What shall we tell civilized people? We shall have to say to them: 'Do not consider us as brothers anymore. We are mean and terrible people; we have killed those who hid at our place, who sought our protection'".&lt;ref name="LensenChʻen1982"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Alexander Lensen|author2=Fang-chih Chʻen|title=The Russo-Chinese War: |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ehhSAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=midst+confidently+blemish+The+Russo-Chinese+War:+Chinese|year=1982|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events also left a longer impact. The historian Robert Bickers found that for the British in China the Boxer rising served as the "equivalent of the Indian 'mutiny'" and came to represent the [[Yellow Peril]]. Later events, he adds, such as the [[Northern Expedition|Chinese Nationalist Revolution]] of the 1920s and even the activities of the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] of the 1960s, were perceived as being in the shadow of the Boxers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bickers, ''Britain in China: Community, Culture, and Colonialism, 1900–1949'' (Manchester; New York: Manchester University Press, distributed in the US by St. Martin's Press,  1999 {{ISBN|0719046971}}), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Taiwan]]  and [[Hong Kong]], history textbooks often present the Boxer as irrational. But in the [[People's Republic of China]], government textbooks described the Boxer movement as an anti-imperialist, patriotic peasant movement whose failure was due to the lack of leadership from the modern working class, and described the international army as an invading force. In recent decades, however, large-scale projects of village interviews and explorations of archival sources have led historians in China to take a more nuanced view. Some non-Chinese scholars, such as Joseph Esherick, have seen the movement as anti-imperialist; while others hold that the concept "nationalistic" is anachronistic because the Chinese nation had not been formed and the Boxers were more concerned with regional issues. Paul Cohen's recent study includes a survey of "the Boxers as myth", showing how their memory was used in changing ways in 20th-century China from the [[New Culture Movement]] to the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Pt Three, "The Boxers As Myth", Cohen, ''History in Three Keys'', pp. 211–288.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the Boxer question has been debated in the People's Republic of China. In 1998, the critical scholar Wang Yi argued that the Boxers had features in common with the extremism of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Both events had the external goal of "liquidating all harmful pests" and the domestic goal of "eliminating bad elements of all descriptions" and this relation was rooted in "cultural obscurantism". Wang explained to his readers the changes in attitudes towards the Boxers from the condemnation of the May Fourth Movement to the approval expressed by [[Mao Zedong]] during the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Wang Yi, "The Cultural Origins of the Boxer Movement's Obscurantism and Its Influence on the Cultural Revolution", in Douglas Kerr, ed., ''Critical Zone Three.'' (Hong Kong University Press), 155.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 [[Yuan Weishi]], a professor of philosophy at [[Zhongshan University]] in Guangzhou, wrote that the Boxers by their "criminal actions brought unspeakable suffering to the nation and its people! These are all facts that everybody knows, and it is a national shame that the Chinese people cannot forget".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20060126_1.htm|title=History Textbooks in China|publisher=Eastsouthwestnorth|accessdate=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuan charged that history text books had been lacking in neutrality in presenting the Boxer Uprising as a "magnificent feat of patriotism", and not presenting the view that the majority of the Boxer rebels were violent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/24/AR2006012401003.html|title=Leading Publication Shut Down In China |date= 25 January 2006|publisher=Washington Post Foreign Service|accessdate=19 October 2008 | first=Philip P. | last=Pan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, some labeled Yuan Weishi a "traitor" ([[Hanjian]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060308103607/http://www.snzg.com.cn/readnews.asp?newsid=1082 网友评论：评中山大学袁时伟的汉奸言论和混蛋逻辑]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The first reports coming from China in 1898 referred to the village activists as "Yihequan", (Wade–Giles: I Ho Ch'uan). The first known use of the term "Boxer" was September 1899 in a letter from missionary Grace Newton in Shandong. It appears from context that "Boxer" was a known term by that time, possibly coined by the Shandong missionaries [[Arthur Henderson Smith|Arthur H. Smith]] and Henry Porter.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 223}} Smith says in his book of 1902 that the name
&lt;blockquote&gt;I Ho Ch'uan... literally denotes the 'Fists' (Ch'uan) of Righteousness (or Public) (I) Harmony (Ho), in apparent allusion to the strength of united force which was to be put forth. As the Chinese phrase 'fists and feet' signifies boxing and wrestling, there appeared to be no more suitable term for the adherents of the sect than 'Boxers,' a designation first used by one or two missionary correspondents of foreign journals in China, and later universally accepted on account of the difficulty of coining a better one.&lt;ref&gt;''China in Convulsion'' Vol I, pp. 154–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On 6 June 1900 the ''Times'' of London used the term "rebellion" in quotation marks, presumably to indicate their view that the rising was in fact instigated by Empress Dowager Cixi.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Elliot, ''Some Did It for Civilisation''", p. 9, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Lanxin Xiang refers to the "so called 'Boxer Rebellion,'" and explains that "while peasant rebellion was nothing new in Chinese history, a war against the world's most powerful states was."&lt;ref&gt;Xiang, ''The Origins of the Boxer War'' p. vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Boxer Rebellion", concludes Joseph Esherick, another recent historian, is truly a "misnomer", for the Boxers "never rebelled against the Manchu rulers of China and their Qing dynasty" and the "most common Boxer slogan, throughout the history of the movement, was "support the Qing, destroy the Foreign." He adds that only after the movement was suppressed by the Allied Intervention did both the foreign powers and influential Chinese officials realize that the Qing would have to remain as government of China in order to maintain order and collect taxes to pay the indemnity. Therefore, in order to save face for the Empress Dowager and the imperial court, the argument was made that the Boxers were rebels and that support from the imperial court came only from a few Manchu princes. Esherick concludes that the origin of the term "rebellion" was "purely political and opportunistic", but it has shown a remarkable staying power, particularly in popular accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Esherick p. xiv. Esherick notes that many textbooks and secondary accounts followed Victor Purcell, ''The Boxer Uprising: A Background Study'' (1963) in seeing a shift from an early anti-dynastic movement to pro-dynastic, but that the "flood of publications" from Taiwan and the People's Republic (including both documents from the time and oral histories conducted in the 1950s) has shown this not to be the case. xv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other recent Western works refer to the "Boxer Movement", "Boxer War" or Yihetuan Movement, while Chinese studies use 义和团运动 (Yihetuan yundong), that is, "Yihetuan Movement." In his discussion of the general and legal implications of the terminology involved, the German scholar Thoralf Klein notes that all of the terms, including the Chinese ones, are "posthumous interpretations of the conflict." He argues that each term, whether it be "uprising", "rebellion" or "movement" implies a different definition of the conflict. Even the term "Boxer War", which has become widely used by recent scholars in the West, raises questions, as war was never declared, and Allied troops behaved as a punitive expedition in colonial style, not in a declared war with legal constraints. The Allies took advantage of the fact that China had not signed "The Laws and Customs of War on Land", a key document at the 1899 [[Hague Peace Conference]]. They argued that China had violated its provisions but themselves ignored them. {{sfnb|Klein|2008}}

By 1900, many new forms of media had matured, including illustrated newspapers and magazines, postcards, broadsides and advertisements, all of which presented images of the Boxers and of the invading armies.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Perdue, "[http://video.mit.edu/watch/mit-visualizing-cultures-visualizing-the-boxer-uprising-10054/ Visualizing the Boxer Uprising]" MIT Visualizing Cultures Illustrated Slide Lecture&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion was covered in the foreign illustrated press by artists and photographers. Paintings and prints were also published including Japanese wood-blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic A. Sharf and Peter Harrington. China 1900: The Artists' Perspective. London: Greenhill, 2000. {{ISBN|1-85367-409-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decades, the Boxers were a constant subject for comment. A sampling includes:

* In the Polish play ''[[The Wedding (1901 play)|The Wedding]]'' by [[Stanisław Wyspiański]], first published on 16 March 1901, even before the rebellion was finally crushed, the character of Czepiec asks the Journalist (''Dziennikarz'') one of the best-known questions in the history of Polish literature: ''"Cóż tam, panie, w polityce? Chińczyki trzymają się mocno!?'' (''"How are things in politics, Mister? Are the Chinese holding out firmly!?"'').&lt;ref name="Wesele"&gt;{{cite web|author=met [2007-08-26] |url=http://broszka.pl/chincyki-trzymaja-sie-mocno,a |title=''Chińcyki trzymają się mocno!?'' |publisher=Broszka.pl |date=26 August 2007 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Liu E]], ''[[The Travels of Lao Can]]''&lt;ref&gt;translated by Harold Shaddick as ''The Travels of Lao Ts'an'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1952), also available in an abridged version which omits some scenes of the Boxers: ''The travels of Lao Can'', translated by Yang Xianyi, Gladys Yang (Beijing: Panda Books, 1983; 176p.),&lt;/ref&gt; sympathetically shows an honest official trying to carry out reforms and depicts the Boxers as sectarian rebels.
* [[G. A. Henty]], ''With the Allies to Pekin, a Tale of the Relief of the Legations'' (New York: Scribners, 1903; London: Blackie, 1904). Juvenile fiction by a widely read author, depicts the Boxers as "a mob of ruffians."
* A false or forged diary, ''Diary of his Excellency Ching-Shan: Being a Chinese Account of the Boxer Troubles'', including text written by [[Sir Edmund Backhouse, 2nd Baronet|Edmund Backhouse]], who claimed he recovered the document from a burnt building. It is suspected that Backhouse falsified the document, as well as other stories, because he was prone to tell tales dubious in nature, including claims of nightly visits to the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]: ''A Hidden Life – The Enigma of Sir Edmund Backhouse'' (Published in the USA as ''Hermit of Peking, The Hidden Life of Sir Edmund Backhouse'') (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', Tintin's Chinese friend [[Chang Chong-Chen]] when they first meet, after Tintin saves the boy from drowning, the boy asks Tintin why he saved him from drowning as, according to Chang's uncle who fought in the Rebellion, all white people were wicked.
* The novel ''[[Moment in Peking]]'' (1939), by [[Lin Yutang]], opens during the Boxer Rebellion, and provides a child's-eye view of the turmoil through the eyes of the protagonist.
* ''[[Tulku (novel)|Tulku]]'', a 1979 children's novel by [[Peter Dickinson]], includes the effects of the Boxer Rebellion on a remote part of China.
* ''[[The Diamond Age]] or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer'' (New York, 1996), by [[Neal Stephenson]], includes a quasi-historical re-telling of the Boxer Rebellion as an integral component of the novel
* The novel ''[[The Palace of Heavenly Pleasure]]'' (2003), by Adam Williams, describes the experiences of a small group of foreign missionaries, traders and railway engineers in a fictional town in northern China shortly before and during the Boxer Rebellion.
* Illusionist William Ellsworth Robinson a.k.a. [[Chung Ling Soo]] had a [[bullet catch]] trick entitled "Condemned to Death by the Boxers", which famously resulted in his onstage death.
* The 1963 film ''[[55 Days at Peking]]'' directed by [[Nicholas Ray]] and starring [[Charlton Heston]], [[Ava Gardner]] and [[David Niven]].&lt;ref name="days"&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0056800|title=55 Days at Peking}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1975 Hong Kong's [[Shaw Brothers]] studio produced the film ''Boxer Rebellion'' ({{zh|t=八國聯軍|p=bāguó liánjūn|w=Pa kuo lien chun|l=Eight-Nation Allied Army}}) under director [[Chang Cheh]] with one of the highest budgets to tell a sweeping story of disillusionment and revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.533288/qx/details.htm |title=HKflix |publisher=HKflix |date= |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hong Kong's [[Shaw Brothers]] ''[[Legendary Weapons of China]]'' (1981), director [[Lau Kar Leung]]. A comedy starring [[Hsiao Ho (actor)|Hsiao Ho]] (Hsiao Hou) as a disillusioned boxer of the Magic Clan who is sent to assassinate the former leader of a powerful boxer clan who refuses to dupe his students into believing they are impervious to firearms.
* There are several flashbacks to the Boxer Rebellion in the television shows ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]].'' During the conflict, [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] kills his first slayer to impress [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]], and [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] decisively splits from [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]].
* The 2003 film, ''[[Shanghai Knights]],'' starring [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]], shows that the Boxers still exist, working for Lord Rathbone, who wants to assassinate many members of the British Royal Family.
* ''[[The Last Empress (novel)|The Last Empress]]'' (Boston, 2007), by [[Anchee Min]], describes the long reign of the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] in which the siege of the legations is one of the climactic events in the novel.
* [[Mo Yan|Mo, Yan]]. ''Sandalwood Death.'' Viewpoint of villagers during Boxer Uprising.&lt;ref&gt;''Sandalwood Death''  (Translated by Howard Goldblatt. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2013. {{ISBN|9780806143392}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The pair of [[graphic novel]]s by [[Gene Luen Yang]], with colour by Lark Pien, ''[[Boxers and Saints]],'' describes the "bands of foreign missionaries and soldiers" who "roam the countryside bullying and robbing Chinese peasants." Little Bao, "harnessing the powers of ancient Chinese gods", recruits an army of Boxers, "commoners trained in [[kung fu]] who fight to free China from 'foreign devils.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Boxers and Saints'' (First Second Books, 2013 {{ISBN|1596439246}})[http://www.worldcat.org/title/boxers-saints-boxed-set/oclc/825754024&amp;referer=brief_results WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2013 video game ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' featured the Boxer Rebellion as a major historical moment for the floating city of Columbia. Columbia, in an effort to rescue American hostages during the rebellion, opened fire upon the city of Peking and burned it to the ground. These actions resulted in the United States recalling Columbia, which led to its secession from the Union.
* The Boxer Rebellion is the historical backdrop for the episode titled "Kung Fu Crabtree" (Season 7, Episode 16, aired 24 March 2014) of the television series ''[[Murdoch Mysteries]],'' when Chinese officials visit Toronto in 1900 in search of Boxers who have fled from China.

==Overview==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
[[Ad hoc]] code reuse has been practiced from the earliest days of [[computer programming|programming]]. Programmers have always reused sections of code, templates, functions, and procedures. Software reuse as a recognized area of study in software engineering, however, dates only from 1968 when [[Douglas McIlroy]] of [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]] proposed basing the software industry on reusable components.

Code reuse aims to save time and resources and reduce redundancy by taking advantage of assets that have already been created in some form within the software product development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lombard Hill Group|title=What Is Software Reuse?|url=http://lombardhill.com/what_reuse.htm|website=lombardhill.com|publisher=Lombard Hill Group|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key idea in reuse is that parts of a [[computer program]] written at one time can be or should be used in the construction of other programs written at a later time.

Code reuse may imply the creation of a separately maintained version of the reusable assets.  While code is the most common resource selected for reuse, other assets generated during the development cycle may offer opportunities for reuse: software components, test suites, designs, documentation, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lombard Hill Group|title=What Is Software Reuse?|url=http://lombardhill.com/what_reuse.htm|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Library (computing)|software library]] is a good example of code reuse. Programmers may decide to create internal abstractions so that certain parts of their program can be reused, or may create custom libraries for their own use. Some characteristics that make software more easily reusable are [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]], [[loose coupling]], high [[Cohesion (computer science)|cohesion]], [[information hiding]] and [[separation of concerns]].

For newly written code to use a piece of existing code, some kind of interface, or means of communication, must be defined. These commonly include a "call" or use of a [[subroutine]], [[Object (computer science)|object]], [[Class (computer science)|class]], or [[Prototype-based programming|prototype]]. In organizations, such practices are formalized and standardized by [[domain engineering]], also known as [[Product Family Engineering|software product line]] engineering.

The general practice of using a prior version of an extant program as a starting point for the next version, is also a form of code reuse.

Some so-called code "reuse" involves simply copying some or all of the code from an existing program into a new one. While organizations can realize [[time to market]] benefits for a new product with this approach, they can subsequently be saddled with many of the same [[code duplication]] problems caused by [[cut and paste programming]].

Many researchers have worked to make reuse faster, easier, more systematic, and an integral part of the normal process of programming. These are some of the main goals behind the invention of [[object-oriented programming]], which became one of the most common forms of formalized reuse. A somewhat later invention is [[generic programming]].

Another, newer means is to use software "[[Source code generation|generator]]s", programs which can create new programs of a certain type, based on a set of parameters that users choose. Fields of study about such systems are [[generative programming]] and [[metaprogramming]].

==Types of reuse==
Concerning motivation and driving factors, reuse can be:
* Opportunistic – While getting ready to begin a project, the team realizes that there are existing components that they can reuse.
* Planned – A team strategically designs components so that they'll be reusable in future projects.

Reuse can be categorized further:

* Internal reuse – A team reuses its own components. This may be a business decision, since the team may want to control a component critical to the project.
* External reuse – A team may choose to license a third-party component. Licensing a third-party component typically costs the team 1 to 20 percent of what it would cost to develop internally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McConnell |first=Steve |title=Rapid Development: Taming Wild Software Schedules |year=1996 |isbn=978-1-55615-900-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team must also consider the time it takes to find, learn and integrate the component.

Concerning form or structure of reuse, code can be:&lt;ref name="sharednow.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Colombo |first=F. |year=2011 |title=It's not just reuse |work=SharedNow.blogspot |url=http://sharednow.blogspot.com/2011/05/its-not-just-reuse.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Referenced – The client code contains a reference to reused code, and thus they have distinct life cycles and can have distinct versions.
* Forked – The client code contains a local or private copy of the reused code, and thus they share a single life cycle and a single version.

Fork-reuse is often discouraged because it's a form of code duplication, which requires that every bug is corrected in each copy, and enhancements made to reused code need to be manually merged in every copy or they become out-of-date. However, fork-reuse can have benefits such as isolation, flexibility to change the reused code, easier packaging, deployment and version management.&lt;ref name="sharednow.blogspot.com"/&gt;

==Systematic==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
Systematic software reuse is a strategy for increasing productivity and improving quality of the software industry. Although it is simple in concept, successful software reuse implementation is difficult in practice. A reason put forward for this is the dependence of software reuse on the context in which it is implemented. Some problematic issues that needs to be addressed related to systematic software reuse are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Champman |first=M. |last2=Van der Merwe |first2=Alta |year=2008 |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1456662 |title=Contemplating Systematic Software Reuse in a Small Project-centric Company |booktitle=Proceeding SAICSIT '08 Proceedings of the 2008 annual research conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists on IT research in developing countries: riding the wave of technology |doi=10.1145/1456659.1456662 |isbn=978-1-60558-286-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*a clear and well-defined product vision is an essential foundation to an [[Software product line|SPL]].
*an evolutionary implementation strategy would be a more pragmatic strategy for the company.
*there exist a need for continuous management support and leadership to ensure success.
*an appropriate organisational structure is needed to support SPL engineering.
*the change of mindset from a project-centric company to a product-oriented company is essential.

==Examples==

===Software libraries===

A very common example of code reuse is the technique of using a [[Library (computer science)|software library]]. Many common operations, such as converting information among different well-known formats, accessing external storage, interfacing with external programs, or manipulating information (numbers, words, names, locations, dates, etc.) in common ways, are needed by many different programs. Authors of new programs can use the code in a software library to perform these tasks, instead of "re-inventing the wheel", by writing fully new code directly in a program to perform an operation. Library implementations often have the benefit of being well-tested, and covering unusual or arcane cases. Disadvantages include the inability to tweak details which may affect performance or the desired output, and the time and cost of acquiring, learning, and configuring the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Code_reuse|title=Code reuse|access-date={{TODAY}}|work=DocForge|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710143019/http://docforge.com/wiki/Code_reuse|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design patterns===

{{main article|Design pattern (computer science)}}

A design pattern is a general solution to a recurring problem. Design patterns are more conceptual than tangible and can be modified to fit the exact need. However, abstract classes and interfaces can be reused to implement certain patterns.

===Frameworks===

{{main article|Software framework}}

Developers generally reuse large pieces of software via third-party applications and frameworks. Though frameworks are usually domain-specific and applicable only to families of applications{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}.

===Higher-order function===
{{main article|Higher-order function}}
In [[functional programming]] higher-order functions can be used in many cases where design patterns or frameworks were formerly used.

===Retrocomputing===

[[Retrocomputing]] encompasses reuse of code, simply because retro programs are being run on older computers, or [[emulator]]s for them.

===Computer security===
In [[computer security]] code-reuse is employed as a software exploit method.&lt;ref name=Bletsch11&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = North Carolina State University| last = Bletsch| first = Tyler | title = Code-reuse Attacks: New Frontiers and Defenses| date = 2011 |isbn=978-1-124-75297-6 |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2338075}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When an attacker is not able to directly input code to modify the control flow of a program, for example in presence of code injection defenses such as [[W^X|W⊕X]], he or she can redirect the control flow to code sequences existing in memory.

Examples of code-reuse attacks are [[return-to-libc attack]], [[return-oriented programming]], and jump-oriented programming.&lt;ref name=Bletsch11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = ACM| pages = 30–40| last1 = Bletsch| first1 = Tyler| last2 = Jiang| first2 = Xuxian| last3 = Freeh| first3 = Vince W| last4 = Liang| first4 = Zhenkai| title = Jump-oriented programming: a new class of code-reuse attack| booktitle = Proceedings of the 6th ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security | date = 2011 |doi=10.1145/1966913.1966919 |url=https://web.comp.nus.edu.sg/~liangzk/papers/asiaccs11.pdf |isbn=978-1-4503-0564-8 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components===

{{main article|Software component}}

A component, in an object-oriented extent, represents a set of collaborative classes (or only one class) and its interfaces. The interfaces are responsible for enabling the replacement of components. Reusable components can also be isolated and synchronized between SCM repositories using component source code management technologies ([https://github.com/teambit/bit CSCM]). 

===Outside computers===
The whole concept of "code reuse" can also encompass engineering applications outside software. For instance, [[Solid modeling|parametric modeling]] in [[computer-aided design]] allows for creating reusable designs. [[Standardization]] results in creation of interoperable parts that can be then reused in many contexts.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Criticism ==
Code reuse results in [[Coupling (computer programming)|dependency]] on the component being reused. [[Rob Pike]] opined that "A little copying is better than a little dependency". When he joined Google, the company was putting heavy emphasis on code reuse. He believes that Google's [[codebase]] still suffers from results of that former policy in terms of compilation speed and maintainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Go Programming Language|title=Go Proverbs – Rob Pike – Gopherfest – November 18, 2015|date=2015-12-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Comparative Toxicogenomics Database''' ('''CTD''') is a public website and research tool launched in November 2004 that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals/drugs, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules.
The database is maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences at [[North Carolina State University]].

==Background==
The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public website and research tool that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules, launched on November 12, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattingly CJ, Rosenstein MC, Colby GT, Forrest JN, Boyer JL |title=The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD): A Resource for Comparative Toxicological Studies |journal=J Exp Zoolog.

==Goals and objectives==
One of the primary goals of CTD is to advance the understanding of the effects of environmental chemicals on human health on the genetic level, a field called [[toxicogenomics]].

The [[etiology]] of many chronic diseases involves interactions between environmental factors and genes that modulate important physiological processes. Chemicals are an important component of the environment. Conditions such as [[asthma]], cancer, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[immunodeficiency]], and [[Parkinson's disease]] are known to be influenced by the environment; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these correlations are not well understood. CTD may help resolve these mechanisms. The most up-to-date extensive list of peer-reviewed scientific articles about CTD is available at their publications page&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctdbase.org/about/publications/#ctdpubs CTD Publications page] ctdbase.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core data==
CTD is a unique resource where [[biocurator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bourne PE, McEntyre J |title=Biocurators: Contributors to the World of Science |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e142 |date=Oct 2006 |pmid=17411327 |pmc=1626157 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salimi N, Vita R |title=The Biocurator: Connecting and Enhancing Scientific Data |journal=PLoS Comput.

* Chemical-gene interactions
* Chemical-disease associations
* Gene-disease associations
* Chemical-phenotype associations

==Data integration==
By integrating the above four data sets, CTD automatically constructs putative chemical-gene-phenotype-disease networks to illuminate molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally-influenced diseases.

These inferred relationships are statistically scored and ranked and can be used by scientists and computational biologists to generate and verify testable hypotheses about toxicogenomic mechanisms and how they relate to human health.

Users can search CTD to explore scientific data for chemicals, genes, diseases, or interactions between any of these three concepts.  Currently,{{when|date=November 2015}} CTD integrates toxicogenomic data for vertebrates and invertebrates.

==Important examples==

===Fermat's Last Theorem===
{{main|Fermat's Last Theorem}}
In [[number theory]], [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] (sometimes called '''Fermat's conjecture''', especially in older texts) states that no three [[positive number|positive]] [[integer]]s ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' can satisfy the equation ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for any integer value of ''n'' greater than two.

This theorem was first conjectured by [[Pierre de Fermat]] in 1637 in the margin of a copy of ''[[Arithmetica]]'' where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Oystein|last=Ore|title=Number Theory and Its History|year=1988|origyear=1948|publisher=Dover|isbn=978-0-486-65620-5|pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|The first successful proof]] was released in 1994 by [[Andrew Wiles]], and formally published in 1995, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians. The unsolved problem stimulated the development of [[algebraic number theory]] in the 19th century and the proof of the [[modularity theorem]] in the 20th century. It is among the most notable theorems in the [[history of mathematics]] and prior to its proof it was in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for "most difficult mathematical problems".

===Four color theorem===
{{Main|Four color theorem}}
[[File:Map of United States vivid colors shown.png|thumb|A four-coloring of a map of the states of the United States (ignoring lakes).]]

In [[mathematics]], the [[four color theorem]], or the four color map theorem, states that, given any separation of a plane into [[wikt:contiguity|contiguous]] regions, producing a figure called a ''map'', no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. Two regions are called ''adjacent'' if they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Formal Proof—The Four-Color Theorem |author=Georges Gonthier |journal=Notices of the AMS |volume=55 |issue=11 |date=December 2008 |pages=1382–1393}}From this paper: Definitions: A planar map is a set of pairwise disjoint subsets of the plane, called regions. A simple map is one whose regions are connected open sets. Two regions of a map are adjacent if their respective closures have a common point that is not a corner of the map. A point is a corner of a map if and only if it belongs to the closures of at least three regions. Theorem: The regions of any simple planar map can be colored with only four colors, in such a way that any two adjacent regions have different colors.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the map of the United States of America, Utah and Arizona are adjacent, but Utah and New Mexico, which only share a [[Four Corners Monument|point]] that also belongs to Arizona and Colorado, are not.

[[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] mentioned the problem in his lectures as early as 1840.&lt;ref name="rouse_ball_1960"&gt;[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] (1960) ''The Four Color Theorem'', in Mathematical Recreations and Essays, Macmillan, New York, pp 222-232.&lt;/ref&gt; The conjecture was first proposed on October 23, 1852&lt;ref name=MacKenzie&gt;Donald MacKenzie, ''Mechanizing Proof: Computing, Risk, and Trust'' (MIT Press, 2004) p103&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Francis Guthrie]], while trying to color the map of counties of England, noticed that only four different colors were needed. The [[five color theorem]], which has a short elementary proof, states that five colors suffice to color a map and was proven in the late 19th century {{Harv|Heawood|1890}}; however, proving that four colors suffice turned out to be significantly harder. A number of false proofs and false [[counterexample]]s have appeared since the first statement of the four color theorem in 1852.

The four color theorem was proven in 1976 by [[Kenneth Appel]] and [[Wolfgang Haken]]. It was the first major [[theorem]] to be [[computer-assisted proof#List of theorems proved with the help of computer programs|proved using a computer]]. Appel and Haken's approach started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps, each of which cannot be part of a smallest-sized counterexample to the four color theorem. (If they did appear, you could make a smaller counter-example.) Appel and Haken used a special-purpose computer program to confirm that each of these maps had this property. Additionally, any map that could potentially be a counterexample must have a portion that looks like one of these 1,936 maps. Showing this required hundreds of pages of hand analysis, Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest counterexamples exists because any must contain, yet do not contain, one of these 1,936 maps. This contradiction means there are no counterexamples at all and that the theorem is therefore true. Initially, their proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the [[computer-assisted proof]] was infeasible for a human to check by hand {{Harv|Swart|1980}}. Since then the proof has gained wider acceptance, although doubts remain {{Harv|Wilson|2002|loc=216–222}}.

The [[Hauptvermutung]] (German for main conjecture) of [[geometric topology]] is the conjecture that any two [[Triangulation (topology)|triangulations]] of a [[triangulable space]] have a common refinement, a single triangulation that is a subdivision of both of them. It was originally formulated in 1908, by [[Ernst Steinitz|Steinitz]] and [[Heinrich Franz Friedrich Tietze|Tietze]].

This conjecture is now known to be false. The non-manifold version was disproved by [[John Milnor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=John W.|last= Milnor |title=Two complexes which are homeomorphic but combinatorially distinct|journal= [[Annals of Mathematics]]|volume=74|year=1961|issue= 2 |pages=575&amp;ndash;590|mr=133127|doi=10.2307/1970299|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt; |jstor=1970299}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1961 using [[Analytic torsion|Reidemeister torsion]].

The [[manifold]] version is true in [[dimension]]s {{nowrap|1=''m'' ≤ 3}}. The cases {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 2 and 3}} were proved by [[Tibor Radó]] and [[Edwin E. Moise]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moise | first = Edwin E. | title = Geometric Topology in Dimensions 2 and 3 | publisher = New York : Springer-Verlag | location = New York | year = 1977 | isbn = 978-0-387-90220-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1920s and 1950s, respectively.

===Weil conjectures===
{{main|Weil conjectures}}
In [[mathematics]], the [[Weil conjectures]] were some highly influential proposals  by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=André Weil|first=André |last=Weil|year=1949}} on the [[generating function]]s (known as [[local zeta-function]]s) derived from counting the number of points on [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] over [[finite field]]s.

A variety ''V'' over a finite field with ''q'' elements has a finite number of [[rational point]]s, as well as points over every finite field with ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; elements containing that field. The generating function has coefficients derived from the numbers ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of points over the (essentially unique) field with ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; elements.

Weil conjectured that such ''zeta-functions'' should be [[rational function]]s, should satisfy a form of [[functional equation]], and should have their zeroes in restricted places. The last two parts were quite consciously modeled on the [[Riemann zeta function]] and [[Riemann hypothesis]]. The rationality was proved by {{harvtxt|Dwork|1960}}, the functional equation by {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1965}}, and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was  proved by {{harvtxt|Deligne|1974}}

===Poincaré conjecture===
{{main|Poincaré conjecture}}
In [[mathematics]], the [[Poincaré conjecture]] is a [[theorem]] about the [[Characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] of the [[3-sphere]], which is the hypersphere that bounds the [[unit ball]] in four-dimensional space. The conjecture states: {{quote|Every [[simply connected]], [[closed manifold|closed]] 3-[[manifold]] is [[homeomorphic]] to the 3-sphere.}} An equivalent form of the conjecture involves a coarser form of equivalence than homeomorphism called [[homotopy equivalence]]: if a 3-manifold is ''homotopy equivalent'' to the 3-sphere, then it is necessarily ''homeomorphic'' to it.

Originally conjectured by [[Henri Poincaré]], the theorem concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three-dimensional space but is connected, finite in size, and lacks any boundary (a [[Closed manifold|closed]] [[3-manifold]]).  The Poincaré conjecture claims that if such a space has the additional property that each [[path (topology)|loop]] in the space can be continuously tightened to a point, then it is necessarily a three-dimensional sphere.  An [[generalized Poincaré conjecture|analogous result]] has been known in higher dimensions for some time.

After nearly a century of effort by mathematicians, [[Grigori Perelman]] presented a proof of the conjecture in three papers made available in 2002 and 2003 on [[arXiv]]. The proof followed on from the program of [[Richard S. Hamilton]] to use the [[Ricci flow]] to attempt to solve the problem. Hamilton later introduced a modification of the standard Ricci flow, called ''Ricci flow with surgery'' to systematically excise singular regions as they develop, in a controlled way, but was unable to prove this method "converged" in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hamilton | first = Richard S. | authorlink = Richard S. Hamilton | title = Four-manifolds with positive isotropic curvature | journal = Communications in Analysis and Geometry | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;92 | year = 1997 | doi =  10.4310/CAG.1997.v5.n1.a1| mr = 1456308 | zbl = 0892.53018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perelman completed this portion of the proof.  Several teams of mathematicians have verified that Perelman's proof is correct.

The Poincaré conjecture, before being proven, was one of the most important open questions in [[topology]].

===Riemann hypothesis===
{{main|Riemann hypothesis}}
In mathematics, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], proposed by {{harvs|txt|first=Bernhard|last= Riemann|year=1859|author-link=Bernhard Riemann}}, is a conjecture that the non-trivial [[root of a function|zeros]] of the [[Riemann zeta function]] all have [[real part]] 1/2.  The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the [[Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields]].

The Riemann hypothesis implies results about the distribution of [[prime numbers]]. Along with suitable generalizations, some mathematicians consider it the most important unresolved problem in [[pure mathematics]] {{harv|Bombieri|2000}}. The Riemann hypothesis, along with the [[Goldbach conjecture]], is part of [[Hilbert's eighth problem]] in [[David Hilbert]]'s list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved problems]]; it is also one of the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] [[Millennium Prize Problems]].

===P versus NP problem===
{{main|P versus NP problem}}
The [[P versus NP problem]] is a major [[List of unsolved problems in computer science|unsolved problem in computer science]].  Informally, it asks whether every  problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer; it is widely conjectured that the answer is no.  It was essentially first mentioned in a 1956 letter written by [[Kurt Gödel]] to [[John von Neumann]].  Gödel asked whether a certain NP complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time.&lt;ref&gt;Juris Hartmanis 1989, [http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/6910/1/89-994.pdf Gödel, von Neumann, and the P = NP problem], Bulletin of the
European Association for Theoretical Computer Science, vol. 38, pp. 101–107&lt;/ref&gt; The precise statement of the P=NP problem was introduced in 1971 by [[Stephen Cook]] in his seminal paper "The complexity of theorem proving procedures"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cook|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Cook|year=1971|chapter=The complexity of theorem proving procedures|chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=805047|title=Proceedings of the Third Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing|pages=151–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered by many to be the most important open problem in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Fortnow]], [http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/pnp-cacm.pdf ''The status of the '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem''], Communications of the ACM 52 (2009), no.&amp;nbsp;9, pp.&amp;nbsp;78–86. {{doi|10.1145/1562164.1562186}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]] selected by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] to carry a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.

Neither one has either been proven or disproven, but it ''has'' been proven that both cannot simultaneously be true.  At least one must be false.  It has not been proven which one is false, but it is widely believed that the first conjecture is true and the second one is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Ian | last=Richards | title=On the Incompatibility of Two Conjectures Concerning Primes | journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. | volume=80 | pages=419–438 | year=1974 | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1974-13434-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution of conjectures==

===Proof===
Formal mathematics is based on ''provable'' truth. In mathematics, any number of cases supporting a conjecture, no matter how large, is insufficient for establishing the conjecture's veracity, since a single [[counterexample]] would immediately bring down the conjecture. Mathematical journals sometimes publish the minor results of research teams having extended the search for a counterexample farther than previously done.  For instance, the [[Collatz conjecture]], which concerns whether or not certain [[sequence]]s of [[integer]]s terminate, has been tested for all integers up to 1.2 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (over a trillion). However, the failure to find a counterexample after extensive search does not constitute a proof that no counterexample exists nor that the conjecture is true, because the conjecture might be false but with a very large minimal counterexample.

Instead, a conjecture is considered proven only when it has been shown that it is logically impossible for it to be false. There are various methods of doing so; see [[Mathematical proof#Methods]] for details.

One method of proof, usable when there are only a finite number of cases that could lead to counterexamples, is known as "brute force": in this approach, all possible cases are considered and shown not to give counterexamples. Sometimes the number of cases is quite large, in which situation a brute-force proof may require as a practical matter the use of a computer algorithm to check all the cases: the validity of the 1976 and 1997 brute-force proofs of the [[four color theorem]] by computer was initially doubted, but was eventually confirmed in 2005 by [[theorem-proving]] software.

When a conjecture has been [[mathematical proof|proven]], it is no longer a conjecture but a [[theorem]]. Many important theorems were once conjectures, such as the [[Geometrization conjecture|Geometrization theorem]] (which resolved the [[Poincaré conjecture]]), [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and others.

===Disproof===
Conjectures disproven through counterexample are sometimes referred to as ''false conjectures'' (cf. the [[Pólya conjecture]] and [[Euler's sum of powers conjecture]]). In the case of the latter, the first counterexample found for the n=4 case involved numbers in the millions, although subsequently it has been found that the minimal counterexample is smaller than that.

===Undecidable conjectures===
Not every conjecture ends up being proven true or false. The [[continuum hypothesis]], which tries to ascertain the relative [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of certain [[infinite set]]s, was eventually shown to be [[Independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] (or independent) from the generally accepted set of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms|axioms of set theory]]. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a new [[axiom]] in a consistent manner (much as we can take [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]] as either true or false).

In this case, if a proof uses this statement, researchers will often look for a new proof that ''doesn't'' require the hypothesis (in the same way that it is desirable that statements in [[Euclidean geometry]] be proved using only the axioms of neutral geometry, i.e. no parallel postulate.) The one major exception to this in practice is the [[axiom of choice]]—unless studying this axiom in particular, the majority of researchers do not usually worry whether a result requires the axiom of choice.

==Conditional proofs==
Sometimes a conjecture is called a ''hypothesis'' when it is used frequently and repeatedly as an assumption in proofs of other results. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is a conjecture from [[number theory]] that (amongst other things) makes predictions about the distribution of [[prime number]]s. Few number theorists doubt that the Riemann hypothesis is true. In anticipation of its eventual proof, some have proceeded to develop further proofs which are contingent on the truth of this conjecture. These are called ''[[conditional proof]]s'': the conjectures assumed appear in the hypotheses of the theorem, for the time being.

These "proofs", however, would fall apart if it turned out that the hypothesis was false, so there is considerable interest in verifying the truth or falsity of conjectures of this type.

==In other sciences==
[[Karl Popper]] pioneered the use of the term "conjecture" in [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|title=Conjectures and refutations : the growth of scientific knowledge|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-28594-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conjecture is related to [[hypothesis]], which in [[science]] refers to a testable conjecture.

{{Electromagnetism|Covariance}}
The '''[[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] formulation of [[classical electromagnetism]]''' refers to ways of writing the laws of classical electromagnetism (in particular, [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Lorentz force]]) in a form that is manifestly invariant under [[Lorentz transformation]]s, in the formalism of [[special relativity]] using rectilinear [[inertial frame|inertial coordinate system]]s. These expressions both make it simple to prove that the laws of classical electromagnetism take the same form in any inertial coordinate system, and also provide a way to translate the fields and forces from one frame to another. However, this is not as general as [[Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime]] or non-rectilinear coordinate systems.

This article uses the [[classical treatment of tensors]] and [[Einstein summation convention]] throughout and the [[Minkowski metric]] has the form diag (+1, −1, −1, −1). Where the equations are specified as holding in a vacuum, one could instead regard them as the formulation of Maxwell's equations in terms of ''total'' charge and current.

For a more general overview of the relationships between classical electromagnetism and special relativity, including various conceptual implications of this picture, see [[Classical electromagnetism and special relativity]].

==Covariant objects==

===Preliminary 4-vectors===
{{Main|Lorentz covariance}}
Lorentz tensors of the following kinds may be used in this article to describe bodies or particles:
*[[Displacement (vector)|4-Displacement]]:
::&lt;math&gt;x^\alpha = (ct,\mathbf{x}) = (ct, x, y, z) \,.&lt;/math&gt;
*[[Four-velocity|4-Velocity]]:
::&lt;math&gt;u^\alpha = \gamma(c,\mathbf{u}) ,&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''γ''('''u''') is the [[Lorentz factor]] at the 3-velocity '''u'''.
*[[Four-momentum|4-Momentum]]:
::&lt;math&gt;p^\alpha = ( E/c,\mathbf{p}) = m_0 u^{\alpha} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; is 3-momentum, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[total energy]], and &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is [[rest mass]].
*[[Four-gradient|4-Gradient]]
:&lt;math&gt;\partial^{\nu} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{\nu}} = \left( \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}, - \mathbf{\nabla} \right) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
*The [[d'Alembertian]] operator is denoted &lt;math&gt; {\partial}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

The signs in the following tensor analysis depend on the [[sign convention#Metric signature|convention]] used for the [[metric tensor]]. The convention used here is &lt;tt&gt;+−−−&lt;/tt&gt;, corresponding to the [[Minkowski space#Standard basis|Minkowski metric tensor]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta^{\mu \nu}=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Electromagnetic tensor===
{{Main|Electromagnetic tensor}}
The electromagnetic tensor is the combination of the electric and magnetic fields into a covariant [[antisymmetric tensor]] whose entries are B-field quantities.

\end{matrix} \right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

where '''E''' is the [[electric field]], '''B''' the [[magnetic field]], and ''c'' the [[speed of light]].

===Four-current===
{{Main|Four-current}}
The four-current is the contravariant four-vector which combines [[electric charge density]] ''ρ'' and [[electric current density]] '''j''':

:&lt;math&gt;J^{\alpha} = ( c \rho, \mathbf{j} ) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Four-potential===
{{Main|Four-potential}}
The electromagnetic four-potential is a covariant four-vector containing the [[electric potential]] (also called the [[scalar potential]]) ''ϕ'' and [[magnetic vector potential]] (or [[vector potential]]) '''A''', as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;A^{\alpha} = \left(\phi/c, \mathbf{A} \right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The differential of the electromagnetic potential is
:&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha \beta} = \partial_{\alpha} A_{\beta} - \partial_{\beta} A_{\alpha} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor===
{{Main|Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor}}
The electromagnetic stress–energy tensor can be interpreted as the flux density of the momentum 4-vector, and is a contravariant symmetric tensor that is the contribution of the electromagnetic fields to the overall [[stress–energy tensor]]:
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha\beta} = \begin{pmatrix} \epsilon_{0}E^2/2 + B^2/2\mu_{0} &amp; S_x/c &amp; S_y/c &amp; S_z/c \\ S_x/c &amp; -\sigma_{xx} &amp; -\sigma_{xy} &amp; -\sigma_{xz} \\
S_y/c &amp; -\sigma_{yx} &amp; -\sigma_{yy} &amp; -\sigma_{yz} \\
S_z/c &amp; -\sigma_{zx} &amp; -\sigma_{zy} &amp; -\sigma_{zz} \end{pmatrix}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[electric constant|electric permittivity of vacuum]], ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[magnetic constant|magnetic permeability of vacuum]], the [[Poynting vector]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Maxwell stress tensor]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij} = \epsilon_{0}E_{i}E_{j} + \frac{1}{\mu_{0}}B_{i}B_{j} - 
\left(\frac12\epsilon_{0}E^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_{0}}B^2\right)\delta_{ij} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The electromagnetic field tensor ''F'' constructs the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor ''T'' by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha\beta} = \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} \left(- \eta_{\gamma \nu}F^{\alpha \gamma}F^{\nu \beta} + \frac{1}{4}\eta^{\alpha\beta}F_{\gamma \nu}F^{\gamma \nu}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''η'' is the [[Minkowski metric]] tensor. Notice that we use the fact that
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{0} \mu_{0} c^2 = 1\,,&lt;/math&gt;
which is predicted by Maxwell's equations.

== Maxwell's equations in vacuum ==
{{Main|Maxwell's equations}}
In vacuum (or for the microscopic equations, not including macroscopic material descriptions), Maxwell's equations can be written as two tensor equations.

The two inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations, [[Gauss's Law]] and [[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère's law]] (with Maxwell's correction) combine into (with +−−− metric):&lt;ref&gt;Classical Electrodynamics by Jackson, 3rd Edition, Chapter 11 Special Theory of Relativity&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''[[Gauss's Law|Gauss]]&amp;ndash;[[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère]] law'''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\alpha}F^{\alpha\beta} = \mu_{0} J^{\beta} &lt;/math&gt; 
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

while the homogeneous equations – [[Faraday's law of induction]] and [[Gauss's law for magnetism]] combine to form:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''[[Gauss's law for magnetism|Gauss]]&amp;ndash;[[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday]] law'''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\alpha}(\tfrac{1}{2}\epsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}F_{\gamma\delta}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

where ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''αβ''&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[electromagnetic tensor]], ''J''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[4-current]], ''ε''&lt;sup&gt;''αβγδ''&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], and the indices behave according to the [[Einstein summation convention]].

Each of these tensor equations corresponds to four scalar equations, one for each value of ''β''. 

Using the [[antisymmetric tensor]] notation and comma notation for the partial derivative (see [[Ricci calculus]]), the second equation can also be written more compactly as:

:&lt;math&gt; F_{[\alpha \beta , \gamma]} = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

In the absence of sources, Maxwell's equations reduce to:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^{\nu} \partial_{\nu}  F^{\alpha\beta} \,\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \, {\partial}^2 F^{\alpha\beta} \,\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ {1 \over c^2 } { \partial^2 F^{\alpha\beta} \over {\partial t }^2   } - \nabla^2 F^{\alpha\beta}= 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which is an [[electromagnetic wave equation]] in the field strength tensor.

===Maxwell's equations in the Lorenz gauge===
&lt;!--Lorenz is the correct name (not Lorentz). Ludvig Lorenz ≠ Hendrik Lorentz --&gt;
{{Main|Lorenz gauge condition}}

The [[Lorenz gauge condition]] is a Lorentz-invariant gauge condition. (This can be contrasted with other [[gauge fixing|gauge conditions]] such as the [[Coulomb gauge]], which if it holds in one [[inertial frame]] it will generally not hold in any other.) It is expressed in terms of the four-potential as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\alpha} A^{\alpha} = \partial^{\alpha} A_{\alpha}=0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In the Lorenz gauge, the microscopic Maxwell's equations can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial}^2 A^{\sigma} = \mu_{0} \, J^{\sigma}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Lorentz force==

{{Main|Lorentz force}}

===Charged particle===
[[File:Lorentz force particle.svg|200px|thumb|[[Lorentz force]] '''f''' on a [[charged particle]] (of [[electric charge|charge]] ''q'') in motion (instantaneous velocity '''v'''). The [[electric field|'''E''' field]] and [[magnetic field|'''B''' field]] vary in space and time.]]

Electromagnetic (EM) fields affect the motion of [[electric charge|electrically charged]] matter: due to the [[Lorentz force]]. In this way, EM fields can be [[Particle detector|detected]] (with applications in [[particle physics]], and natural occurrences such as in [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]]). In relativistic form, the Lorentz force uses the field strength tensor as follows.&lt;ref&gt;The assumption is made that no forces other than those originating in '''E''' and '''B''' are present, that is, no [[gravitation]]al, [[weak force|weak]] or [[strong force|strong]] forces.&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressed in terms of [[coordinate time]] ''t'', it is:
:&lt;math&gt; { d p_{\alpha} \over { d t } } =  q \, F_{\alpha \beta} \, \frac{d x^\beta}{d t} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is the four-momentum, ''q'' is the [[Electric charge|charge]], and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt; is the position.

In the co-moving reference frame, this yields the 4-force

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d p_{\alpha}}{d \tau} \, = q \, F_{\alpha \beta} \, u^\beta &lt;/math&gt;

where ''u''&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt; is the four-velocity, and τ is the particle's [[proper time]], which is related to coordinate time by ''dt'' = γ''d''τ.

===Charge continuum===
[[File:Lorentz force continuum.svg|200px|thumb|Lorentz force per spatial volume '''f''' on a continuous [[charge distribution]] ([[charge density]] ρ) in motion.]]

{{see also|continuum mechanics}}
The density of force due to electromagnetism, whose spatial part is the Lorentz force, is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;f_{\alpha} = F_{\alpha\beta}J^{\beta} .\!&lt;/math&gt;

and is related to the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor by
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\alpha} = - {T^{\alpha\beta}}_{,\beta} \equiv  - \frac{\partial T^{\alpha\beta}}{\partial x^\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Conservation laws==

The [[continuity equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;{J^{\alpha}}_{,\alpha} \, \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \,  \partial_{\alpha} J^{\alpha} \, = \, 0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;
expresses [[charge conservation]].

===Electromagnetic energy–momentum===

Using the Maxwell equations, one can see that the [[electromagnetic stress–energy tensor]] (defined above) satisfies the following differential equation, relating it to the electromagnetic tensor and the current four-vector
:&lt;math&gt;{T^{\alpha\beta}}_{,\beta} + F^{\alpha\beta} J_{\beta} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

or
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\alpha \nu} { T^{\nu \beta } }_{,\beta} + F_{\alpha \beta} J^{\beta} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which expresses the conservation of linear momentum and energy by electromagnetic interactions.

==Covariant objects in matter==

===Free and bound 4-currents===

In order to solve the equations of electromagnetism given here, it is necessary to add information about how to calculate the electric current, ''J''&lt;sup&gt;ν&lt;/sup&gt; Frequently, it is convenient to separate the current into two parts, the free current and the bound current, which are modeled by different equations;

:&lt;math&gt;J^{\nu} = {J^{\nu}}_{\text{free}} + {J^{\nu}}_{\text{bound}} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;{J^{\nu}}_{\text{free}}=(c\rho_{\text{free}},\mathbf{J}_{\text{free}})=\left(c \nabla \cdot \mathbf{D}, - \ \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t}+\nabla\times\mathbf{H}\right) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{J^{\nu}}_{\text{bound}}=(c\rho_{\text{bound}},\mathbf{J}_{\text{bound}})=\left(- \ c \nabla \cdot \mathbf{P}, \frac{\partial \mathbf{P}}{\partial t}+\nabla\times\mathbf{M}\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Maxwell's equations#Maxwell's "macroscopic" equations|Maxwell's macroscopic equations]] have been used, in addition the definitions of the [[electric displacement]] '''D''' and the [[magnetic field|magnetic intensity]] '''H''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H} = \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} \mathbf{B} - \mathbf{M} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

where '''M''' is the [[magnetization]] and '''P''' the [[electric polarization]].

===Magnetization-polarization tensor===

The bound current is derived from the '''P''' and '''M''' fields which form an antisymmetric contravariant magnetization-polarization tensor &lt;ref name=Vanderlinde /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathcal{M}^{\mu \nu} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
   0     &amp; P_xc &amp; P_yc &amp; P_zc \\
   - P_xc &amp; 0      &amp;  - M_z   &amp; M_y    \\
   -  P_yc &amp; M_z    &amp; 0      &amp; - M_x   \\
   -  P_zc &amp; - M_y   &amp; M_x    &amp; 0       
  \end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

which determines the bound current
:&lt;math&gt;{J^{\nu}}_{\text{bound}}=\partial_{\mu} \mathcal{M}^{\mu \nu} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Electric displacement tensor===

If this is combined with ''F''&lt;sup&gt;μν&lt;/sup&gt; we get the antisymmetric contravariant  electromagnetic displacement tensor which combines the '''D''' and '''H''' fields as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
   0     &amp; - D_xc &amp; - D_yc &amp; - D_zc \\
   D_xc &amp; 0      &amp; - H_z   &amp; H_y    \\
   D_yc &amp; H_z    &amp; 0      &amp; - H_x   \\
   D_zc &amp; - H_y   &amp; H_x    &amp; 0       
  \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The three field tensors are related by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} = \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} F^{\mu \nu} - \mathcal{M}^{\mu \nu} \,&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to the definitions of the '''D''' and '''H''' fields given above.

==Maxwell's equations in matter==

The result is that [[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère's law]], 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\nabla} \times \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{J}_{\text{free}} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}} {\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;,
and [[Gauss's law]], 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{D} = \rho_{\text{free}}&lt;/math&gt;,

combine into one equation:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''[[Gauss's Law|Gauss]]&amp;ndash;[[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère]] law''' ''(matter)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;{J^{\nu}}_{\text{free}} = \partial_{\mu} \mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

The bound current and free current as defined above are automatically and separately conserved
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\nu} {J^{\nu}}_{\text{bound}} = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\nu} {J^{\nu}}_{\text{free}} = 0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Constitutive equations===

{{main|Constitutive equation}}

====Vacuum====

In vacuum, the constitutive relations between the field tensor and displacement tensor are:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_0 \mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} = \eta^{\mu \alpha} F_{\alpha \beta} \eta^{\beta \nu} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Antisymmetry reduces these 16 equations to just six independent equations. Because it is usual to define ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''μν''&lt;/sup&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;F^{\mu \nu} = \eta^{\mu \alpha} F_{\alpha \beta} \eta^{\beta \nu} ,&lt;/math&gt;

the constitutive equations may, in ''vacuum'', be combined with the Gauss–Ampère law to get:
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\beta F^{\alpha \beta} = \mu_0 J^{\alpha}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The electromagnetic stress–energy tensor in terms of the displacement is:

:&lt;math&gt;T_\alpha{}^\pi = F_{\alpha\beta} \mathcal{D}^{\pi\beta} - \frac{1}{4} \delta_\alpha^\pi F_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{D}^{\mu\nu} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;π&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]]. When the upper index is lowered with ''η'', it becomes symmetric and is part of the source of the gravitational field.

====Linear, nondispersive matter====

Thus we have reduced the problem of modeling the current, ''J''&lt;sup&gt;ν&lt;/sup&gt; to two (hopefully) easier problems &amp;mdash; modeling the free current, ''J''&lt;sup&gt;ν&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; and modeling the magnetization and polarization, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M}^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, in the simplest materials at low frequencies, one has
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_{\text{free}} = \sigma \mathbf{E} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \epsilon_0 \chi_e \mathbf{E} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} = \chi_m \mathbf{H} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where one is in the instantaneously comoving inertial frame of the material, σ is its [[electrical conductivity]], χ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is its [[electric susceptibility]], and χ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is its [[magnetic susceptibility]].

The constitutive relations between the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; and ''F'' tensors, proposed by [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]] for a linear materials (that is, '''E''' is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to '''D''' and '''B''' proportional to '''H'''), are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|edition=3rd|author=D.J. Griffiths|publisher = Dorling Kindersley|year=2007|page=563|isbn=81-7758-293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\mu\nu}u_\nu= c^2\epsilon F^{\mu\nu} u_\nu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{\star\mathcal{D}^{\mu\nu}}u_\nu= \frac{1}{\mu}{\star F^{\mu\nu}} u_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u'' is the 4-velocity of material, ε and μ are respectively the proper [[permittivity]] and [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of the material (i.e. in rest frame of material), &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; and denotes the [[Hodge dual]].

==Lagrangian for classical electrodynamics==

===Vacuum===
The [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] density for classical electrodynamics is
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} \, = \, \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{field}} + \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}} = - \frac{1}{4 \mu_0} F^{\alpha \beta} F_{\alpha \beta} - A_{\alpha} J^{\alpha} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In the interaction term, the four-current should be understood as an abbreviation of many terms expressing the electric currents of other charged fields in terms of their variables; the four-current is not itself a fundamental field.

The [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] for the electromagnetic Lagrangian density &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}(A_{\alpha},\partial_{\beta}A_{\alpha})\,&lt;/math&gt; can be stated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \partial_{\beta}\left[\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial_{\beta}A_{\alpha})}\right]  - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial A_{\alpha}}=0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Noting 
:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mu \nu}=\partial_{\mu} A_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu} A_{\mu}\,&lt;/math&gt;,
the expression inside the square bracket is 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial_{\beta}A_{\alpha})} &amp; = - \ \frac{1}{4 \mu_0}\ \frac{\partial (F_{\mu \nu}\eta^{\mu\lambda}\eta^{\nu\sigma}F_{\lambda \sigma})}{\partial (\partial_{\beta}A_{\alpha})} \\
 &amp; = - \ \frac{1}{4 \mu_0}\ \eta^{\mu\lambda}\eta^{\nu\sigma}
\left(F_{\lambda\sigma}(\delta^{\beta}_{\mu}\delta^{\alpha}_{\nu} - \delta^{\beta}_{\nu}\delta^{\alpha}_{\mu})
+F_{\mu\nu}(\delta^{\beta}_{\lambda}\delta^{\alpha}_{\sigma} - \delta^{\beta}_{\sigma}\delta^{\alpha}_{\lambda})
\right) \\
 &amp; = - \ \frac{F^{\beta\alpha}}{\mu_0}\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The second term is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial A_{\alpha}}= - J^{\alpha} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the electromagnetic field's equations of motion are
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial F^{\beta\alpha}}{\partial x^{\beta}}=\mu_0 J^{\alpha} \,.&lt;/math&gt;
which is one of the Maxwell equations above.

===Matter===

Separating the free currents from the bound currents, another way to write the Lagrangian density is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} \, = \, - \frac{1}{4 \mu_0} F^{\alpha \beta} F_{\alpha \beta} - A_{\alpha} J^{\alpha}_{\text{free}} + \frac12 F_{\alpha \beta} \mathcal{M}^{\alpha \beta} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Using Euler–Lagrange equation, the equations of motion for &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{D}^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; can be derived.

The equivalent expression in non-relativistic vector notation is
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} \, = \, \frac12 \left(\epsilon_{0} E^2 - \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} B^2\right) - \phi \, \rho_{\text{free}} + \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{J}_{\text{free}} + \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{P} + \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{M} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Irrotationalfield.svg|thumb|Vector field corresponding to a differential form on the [[punctured plane]] that is closed but not exact, showing that the de Rham cohomology of this space is non-trivial.]]
In [[mathematics]], '''de Rham cohomology''' (after [[Georges de Rham]]) is a tool belonging both to [[algebraic topology]] and to [[differential topology]], capable of expressing basic topological information about [[smooth manifold]]s in a form particularly adapted to computation and the concrete representation of [[cohomology class]]es. It is a [[cohomology theory]] based on the existence of [[differential form]]s with prescribed properties.

{{Quote frame|text=The integration on forms concept is of fundamental importance in differential topology, geometry, and physics, and also yields one of the most important examples of ''cohomology'', namely ''de Rham cohomology'', which (roughly speaking) measures precisely the extent to which the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] fails in higher dimensions and on general manifolds.
|author=[[Terence Tao]]|source=''Differential Forms and Integration''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tao|last=Terence |url=http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/preprints/forms.pdf |title=Differential Forms and Integration}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition==
The '''de Rham complex''' is the [[cochain complex]] of [[differential form]]s on some [[smooth manifold]] {{mvar|M}}, with the [[exterior derivative]] as the differential:

:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \Omega^0(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^1(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^2(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^3(M) \to \cdots ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}} is the space of [[Smoothness|smooth functions]] on {{mvar|M}}, {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}} is the space of {{math|1}}-forms, and so forth. Forms that are the image of other forms under the [[exterior derivative]], plus the constant {{math|0}} function in {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}}, are called '''exact''' and forms whose exterior derivative is {{math|0}} are called '''closed''' (see ''[[Closed and exact differential forms]]''); the relationship {{math|''d''{{i sup|2}} {{=}} 0}} then says that exact forms are closed. 

In contrast, closed forms are not necessarily exact. An illustrative case is a circle as a manifold, and the {{math|1}}-form corresponding to the derivative of angle from a reference point at its centre, typically written as {{math|''dθ''}} (described at ''[[Closed and exact differential forms]]''). There is no function {{math|''θ''}} defined on the whole circle such that {{math|''dθ''}} is its derivative; the increase of {{math|2''π''}} in going once around the circle in the positive direction implies a [[multivalued function]] {{math|''θ''}}. Removing one point of the circle obviates this, at the same time changing the topology of the manifold.

The idea behind de Rham cohomology is to define [[equivalence class]]es of closed forms on a manifold. One classifies two closed forms {{math|''α'', ''β'' ∈ Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}} as '''cohomologous''' if they differ by an exact form, that is, if {{math|''α'' − ''β''}} is exact. This classification induces an equivalence relation on the space of closed forms in {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}}. One then defines the {{mvar|k}}-th '''de Rham cohomology group''' &lt;math&gt;H^{k}_{\mathrm{dR}}(M)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of equivalence classes, that is, the set of closed forms in {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}} modulo the exact forms.

Note that, for any manifold {{mvar|M}} composed of {{math|''m''}} disconnected components, each of which is [[Connected space|connected]], we have that

:&lt;math&gt;H^{0}_{\mathrm{dR}}(M) \cong \R ^m .&lt;/math&gt;

This follows from the fact that any smooth function on {{mvar|M}} with zero derivative everywhere is separately constant on each of the connected components of {{mvar|M}}.

==De Rham cohomology computed==
One may often find the general de Rham cohomologies of a manifold using the above fact about the zero cohomology and a [[Mayer–Vietoris sequence]]. Another useful fact is that the de Rham cohomology is a [[homotopy]] invariant. While the computation is not given, the following are the computed de Rham cohomologies for some common [[topological]] objects:

===The {{math|''n''}}-sphere===
For the [[n-sphere|{{mvar|n}}-sphere]], ''S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', and also when taken together with a product of open intervals, we have the following. Let {{math|''n'' &gt; 0, ''m'' ≥ 0}}, and {{mvar|I}} be an open real interval. Then

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(S^n \times I^m) \simeq \begin{cases} \R &amp;  k = 0,n, \\ 0 &amp;  k \ne 0,n. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

===The {{math|''n''}}-torus===
Similarly, allowing {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}} here, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(T^n) \simeq \R ^{n \choose k}.&lt;/math&gt;

We can also find explicit generators for the de Rham cohomology of the torus directly using differential forms. Given a quotient manifold &lt;math&gt;\pi: X \to X/G&lt;/math&gt; and a differential form &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \Omega^k(X)&lt;/math&gt; we can say that &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;'''-invariant''' if given any diffeomorphism induced by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cdot g:X \to X&lt;/math&gt; we can &lt;math&gt;(\cdot g)^*(\omega) = \omega&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the pullback of any form on &lt;math&gt;X/G&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-invariant. Also, the pullback is an injective morphism. In our case of &lt;math&gt;\R^n/\Z^n&lt;/math&gt; the differential forms &lt;math&gt;dx_i&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\Z^n&lt;/math&gt;-invariant since &lt;math&gt;d (x_i + k) = dx_i&lt;/math&gt;. But, notice that &lt;math&gt;x_i + \alpha&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \R&lt;/math&gt; is not an invariant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;-form. This with injectivity implies that

:&lt;math&gt;[dx_i] \in H^1_{dR}(T^n)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the cohomology ring of a torus is generated by &lt;math&gt;H^1&lt;/math&gt;, taking the exterior products of these forms gives all of the explicit representatives for the de Rham cohomology of a torus.

===Punctured Euclidean space===
Punctured Euclidean space is simply [[Euclidean space]] with the origin removed.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\forall n \in \N, H_{\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(\R ^n \setminus \{\vec{0}\}) &amp;\simeq \begin{cases} \R &amp; k = 0,n-1 \\ 0 &amp; k \ne 0,n-1 \end{cases} \\
&amp;\simeq H_{\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(S^{n-1})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===The Möbius strip===
We may deduce from the fact that the [[Möbius strip]], {{mvar|M}}, can be [[deformation retract]]ed to the {{math|1}}-sphere (i.e. the real unit circle), that:

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(M) \simeq H_{\mathrm{dR}}^{k}(S^1).&lt;/math&gt;

==De Rham's theorem==
[[Stokes' theorem]] is an expression of [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] between de Rham cohomology and the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of [[Chain (algebraic topology)|chains]]. It says that the pairing of differential forms and chains, via integration, gives a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] from de Rham cohomology &lt;math&gt;H^{k}_{\mathrm{dR}}(M)&lt;/math&gt; to [[singular cohomology|singular cohomology group]]s &lt;math&gt;H^k(M;\R).&lt;/math&gt; '''De Rham's theorem''', proved by [[Georges de Rham]] in 1931, states that for a smooth manifold {{mvar|M}}, this map is in fact an isomorphism. 

More precisely, consider the map 

:&lt;math&gt;I: H_{\mathrm{dR}}^p(M) \to H^p(M; \R),&lt;/math&gt; 

defined as follows: for any &lt;math&gt;[\omega] \in H_{\mathrm{dR}}^p(M)&lt;/math&gt;, let {{math|''I''(''ω'')}} be the element of &lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}(H_p(M; \R ), \R ) \simeq H^p(M; \R )&lt;/math&gt; that acts as follows: 

:&lt;math&gt;H_p(M) \ni [c] \longmapsto \int_c \omega.&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem of de Rham asserts that this is an isomorphism between de Rham cohomology and singular cohomology.

The [[exterior product]] endows the [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of these groups with a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure. A further result of the theorem is that the two [[cohomology ring]]s are isomorphic (as [[graded ring]]s), where the analogous product on singular cohomology is the [[cup product]].

==Sheaf-theoretic de Rham isomorphism==
The de Rham cohomology is [[isomorphic]] to the [[Čech cohomology]] {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;∗&lt;/sup&gt;('''U''', ''F'')}}, where {{mvar|F}} is the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of [[abelian group]]s determined by &lt;math&gt;F(U) = \R&lt;/math&gt; for all connected open sets {{math|''U'' ⊂ ''M''}}, and for open sets {{math|''U'', ''V''}} such that {{math|''U'' ⊂ ''V''}}, the group morphism {{math|res&lt;sub&gt;''V'',''U''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''F''(''V'') → ''F''(''U'')}} is given by the identity map on &lt;math&gt;\R,&lt;/math&gt; and where {{math|'''U'''}} is a good [[open cover]] of {{mvar|M}} (i.e. all the open sets in the open cover {{math|'''U'''}} are [[Contractible space|contractible]] to a point, and all finite intersections of sets in {{math|'''U'''}} are either empty or contractible to a point).

Stated another way, if {{mvar|M}} is a compact [[differentiability class|{{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''m''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] manifold of dimension {{mvar|m}}, then for each {{math|''k'' ≤ ''m''}}, there is an isomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;H^k_{\mathrm{dR}}(M)\cong \check{H}^k(M,\R )&lt;/math&gt;

where the left-hand side is the {{mvar|k}}-th de Rham cohomology group and the right-hand side is the Čech cohomology for the [[constant sheaf]] with fibre &lt;math&gt;\R.&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===
Let {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf of germs]] of {{mvar|k}}-forms on {{mvar|M}} (with {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} the sheaf of {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''m''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} functions on {{mvar|M}}). By the [[Poincaré lemma]], the following sequence of sheaves is exact (in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of sheaves):

:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \R \to \Omega^0 \,\xrightarrow{d}\, \Omega^1 \,\xrightarrow{d}\, \Omega^2\,\xrightarrow{d} \dots \xrightarrow{d}\, \Omega^m \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This sequence now breaks up into [[short exact sequence]]s

:&lt;math&gt;0 \to d\Omega^{k-1} \,\xrightarrow{\subset}\, \Omega^k \,\xrightarrow{d}\, d\Omega^k \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Each of these induces a [[long exact sequence]] in cohomology. Since the sheaf of {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''m''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} functions on a manifold admits [[partition of unity|partitions of unity]], the sheaf-cohomology {{math|''H&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} vanishes for {{math|''i'' &gt; 0}}. So the long exact cohomology sequences themselves ultimately separate into a chain of isomorphisms. At one end of the chain is the Čech cohomology and at the other lies the de Rham cohomology.

==Related ideas==
The de Rham cohomology has inspired many mathematical ideas, including [[Dolbeault cohomology]], [[Hodge theory]], and the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]]. However, even in more classical contexts, the theorem has inspired a number of developments. Firstly, the [[Hodge theory]] proves that there is an isomorphism between the cohomology consisting of harmonic forms and the de Rham cohomology consisting of closed forms modulo exact forms. This relies on an appropriate definition of harmonic forms and of the Hodge theorem. For further details see [[Hodge theory]].

===Harmonic forms===
{{see also|Harmonic differential}}
If {{mvar|M}} is a [[Compact space|compact]] [[Riemannian manifold]], then each equivalence class in &lt;math&gt;H^k_{\mathrm{dR}}(M)&lt;/math&gt; contains exactly one [[harmonic form]]. That is, every member {{mvar|ω}} of a given equivalence class of closed forms can be written as 

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \alpha + \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|α}} is exact and {{mvar|γ}} is harmonic: {{math|Δ''γ'' {{=}} 0}}.

Any [[harmonic function]] on a compact connected Riemannian manifold is a constant. Thus, this particular representative element can be understood to be an extremum (a minimum) of all cohomologously equivalent forms on the manifold. For example, on a {{math|2}}-[[torus]], one may envision a constant {{math|1}}-form as one where all of the "hair" is combed neatly in the same direction (and all of the "hair" having the same length). In this case, there are two cohomologically distinct combings; all of the others are linear combinations. In particular, this implies that the 1st [[Betti number]] of a {{math|2}}-torus is two. More generally, on an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional torus {{math|''T&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, one can consider the various combings of {{mvar|k}}-forms on the torus. There are {{mvar|n}} choose {{mvar|k}} such combings that can be used to form the basis vectors for &lt;math&gt;H^k_{\text{dR}}(T^n)&lt;/math&gt;; the {{mvar|k}}-th Betti number for the de Rham cohomology group for the {{mvar|n}}-torus is thus {{mvar|n}} choose {{mvar|k}}.

More precisely, for a [[differential manifold]] {{mvar|M}}, one may equip it with some auxiliary [[Riemannian metric]]. Then the [[Laplacian]] {{math|Δ}} is defined by 

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta=d\delta+\delta d&lt;/math&gt;
 
with {{mvar|d}} the [[exterior derivative]] and {{mvar|δ}} the [[codifferential]]. The Laplacian is a homogeneous (in [[graded algebra|grading]]) [[linear]] [[differential operator]] acting upon the [[exterior algebra]] of [[differential form]]s: we can look at its action on each component of degree {{mvar|k}} separately. 

If {{mvar|M}} is [[Compact space|compact]] and [[oriented]], the [[dimension]] of the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the Laplacian acting upon the space of [[differential form|{{mvar|k}}-form]]s is then equal (by [[Hodge theory]]) to that of the de Rham cohomology group in degree {{mvar|k}}: the Laplacian picks out a unique ''harmonic'' form in each cohomology class of [[closed form (calculus)|closed form]]s. In particular, the space of all harmonic {{mvar|k}}-forms on {{mvar|M}} is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;H^k(M;\R).&lt;/math&gt; The dimension of each such space is finite, and is given by the {{mvar|k}}-th [[Betti number]].

===Hodge decomposition===
Let {{math|''M''}} be a [[Compact space|compact]] [[oriented manifold|oriented]] [[Riemannian manifold]].  The ''Hodge decomposition'' states that any {{math|''k''}}-form on {{math|''M''}} uniquely splits into the sum of three [[lp space|{{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] components:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \alpha + \beta + \gamma ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''α''}} is exact, {{math|''β''}} is co-exact, and {{mvar|γ}} is harmonic.

One says that a form {{math|''β''}} is co-closed if {{math|''δβ'' {{=}} 0}} and co-exact if {{math|''β'' {{=}} ''δη''}} for some form {{math|''η''}}, and that {{math|''γ''}} is harmonic if {{math|Δ''γ'' {{=}} 0}}. This follows by noting that exact and co-exact forms are orthogonal; the orthogonal complement then consists of forms that are both closed and co-closed: that is, of harmonic forms. Here, orthogonality is defined with respect to the [[lp space|{{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] inner product on {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)=\int_M \alpha \wedge {\star\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

By use of [[Sobolev space]]s or [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], the decomposition can be extended for example to a complete (oriented or not) Riemannian manifold.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Demailly, [https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~demailly/manuscripts/agbook.pdf Complex Analytic and Differential Geometry] Ch VIII, § 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''dot product''' or '''scalar product'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;The term ''scalar product'' is often also used more generally to mean a [[symmetric bilinear form]], for example for a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]].{{cn|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[algebraic operation]] that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually [[coordinate vector]]s) and returns a single number.  In [[Euclidean geometry]], the dot product of the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of two [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]] is widely used and often called "the" '''inner product''' (or rarely '''projection product''') of Euclidean space even though it is not the only inner product that can be defined on Euclidean space; see also [[inner product space]].

Algebraically, the dot product is the sum of the [[Product (mathematics)|products]] of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers. Geometrically, it is the product of the [[Euclidean vector#Length|Euclidean magnitude]]s of the two vectors and the [[cosine]] of the angle between them. These definitions are equivalent when using Cartesian coordinates. In modern [[geometry]], [[Euclidean space]]s are often defined by using [[vector space]]s. In this case, the dot product is used for defining lengths (the length of a vector is the [[square root]] of the dot product of the vector by itself) and angles (the cosine of the angle of two vectors is the quotient of their dot product by the product of their lengths).

The name "dot product" is derived from the [[Interpunct|centered dot]] "&amp;nbsp;'''·'''&amp;nbsp;" that is often used to designate this operation; the alternative name "scalar product" emphasizes that the result is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], rather than a [[Euclidean vector|vector]], as is the case for the [[vector product]] in three-dimensional space.

==Definition==
The dot product may be defined algebraically or geometrically.  The geometric definition is based on the notions of angle and distance (magnitude of vectors). The equivalence of these two definitions relies on having a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] for Euclidean space.

In modern presentations of [[Euclidean geometry]], the points of space are defined in terms of their [[Cartesian coordinates]], and [[Euclidean space]] itself is commonly identified with the [[real coordinate space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. In such a presentation, the notions of length and angles are defined by means of the dot product. The length of a vector is defined as the [[square root]] of the dot product of the vector by itself, and the [[cosine]] of the (non oriented) angle of two vectors of length one is defined as their dot product.  So the equivalence of the two definitions of the dot product is a part of the equivalence of the classical and the modern formulations of Euclidean geometry.

===Algebraic definition===
The dot product of two vectors {{nowrap|1={{ font color | red |  '''a'''}}  = {{ font color | red |[''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] }}}} and {{nowrap|1={{ font color | blue | '''b''' }} = {{ font color | blue |[''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] }}}} is defined as:&lt;ref name="Lipschutz2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=S. Lipschutz |author2=M. Lipson |title= Linear Algebra (Schaum’s Outlines)|edition= 4th |year= 2009|publisher= McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0-07-154352-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\color{red}a}\cdot\mathbf{\color{blue}b}=\sum_{i=1}^n {\color{red}a}_i{\color{blue}b}_i={\color{red}a}_1{\color{blue}b}_1+{\color{red}a}_2{\color{blue}b}_2+\cdots+{\color{red}a}_n{\color{blue}b}_n&lt;/math&gt;

where Σ denotes [[Summation|summation]] and ''n'' is the dimension of the [[vector space]]. For instance, in [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|three-dimensional space]], the dot product of vectors {{nowrap|{{ font color | red |[1, 3, −5]}}}} and {{nowrap|{{ font color | blue |[4, −2, −1]}}}} is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\ [{\color{red}1, 3, -5}] \cdot  [{\color{blue}4, -2, -1}] &amp;= ({\color{red}1} \times {\color{blue}4}) + ({\color{red}3}\times{\color{blue}-2}) + ({\color{red}-5}\times{\color{blue}-1}) \\
&amp;= 4 - 6 + 5 \\
&amp;= 3
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If vectors are identified with [[row matrix|row matrices]], the dot product can also be written as a [[matrix multiplication|matrix product]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\color{red}a} \cdot \mathbf{\color{blue}b} = \mathbf{\color{red}a}\mathbf{\color{blue}b}^\top,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\color{blue}b}^\top&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[transpose]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\color{blue}b}&lt;/math&gt;.

Expressing  the above example in this way, a 1 × 3 matrix ([[row vector]]) is multiplied by a 3 × 1 matrix ([[column vector]]) to get a 1 × 1 matrix that is identified with its unique entry: 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
   \color{red}1 &amp; \color{red}3 &amp; \color{red}-5
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
   \color{blue}4 \\ \color{blue}-2 \\ \color{blue}-1
  \end{bmatrix} = \color{purple}3 
&lt;/math&gt;.

===Geometric definition===
[[File:Inner-product-angle.svg|thumb|Illustration showing how to find the angle between vectors using the dot product]]
In [[Euclidean space]], a [[Euclidean vector]] is a geometric object that possesses both a magnitude and a direction.  A vector can be pictured as an arrow.  Its magnitude is its length, and its direction is the direction that the arrow points.  The magnitude of a vector '''a''' is denoted by &lt;math&gt; \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| &lt;/math&gt;.  The dot product of two Euclidean vectors '''a''' and '''b''' is defined by&lt;ref name="Spiegel2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=M.R. Spiegel |author2=S. Lipschutz |author3=D. Spellman |title= Vector Analysis (Schaum’s Outlines)|edition= 2nd |year= 2009|publisher= McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=A I Borisenko|author2=I E Taparov|title=Vector and tensor analysis with applications|publisher=Dover|translator=Richard Silverman|year=1968|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=\|\mathbf{a}\|\ \|\mathbf{b}\|\cos(\theta) ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|θ}} is the [[angle]] between '''a''' and '''b'''.

In particular, if '''a''' and '''b''' are [[orthogonal]] (the angle between vectors is 90°) then due to &lt;math&gt;\cos(90^\circ) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;
At the other extreme, if they are codirectional, then the angle between them is 0° and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = \left\| \mathbf a \right\| \, \left\| \mathbf b \right\| &lt;/math&gt;
This implies that the dot product of a vector '''a''' with itself is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf a = \left\| \mathbf a \right\| ^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;
which gives
: &lt;math&gt; \left\| \mathbf a \right\| = \sqrt{\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf a} ,&lt;/math&gt;
the formula for the [[Euclidean length]] of the vector.

===Scalar projection and first properties===
[[File:Dot Product.svg|thumb|right|Scalar projection]]
The [[scalar projection]] (or scalar component) of a Euclidean vector '''a''' in the direction of a Euclidean vector '''b''' is given by
:&lt;math&gt; a_b = \left\| \mathbf a \right\| \cos \theta ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|θ}} is the angle between '''a''' and '''b'''.

In terms of the geometric definition of the dot product, this can be rewritten
:&lt;math&gt;a_b = \mathbf a \cdot \widehat{\mathbf b} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \widehat{\mathbf b} = \mathbf b / \left\| \mathbf b \right\| &lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit vector]] in the direction of '''b'''.

[[File:Dot product distributive law.svg|thumb|right|Distributive law for the dot product]]
The dot product is thus characterized geometrically by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Arfken | first1=G. B. | last2=Weber | first2=H. J. | title=Mathematical Methods for Physicists | publisher=[[Academic Press]] | location=Boston, MA | edition=5th | isbn=978-0-12-059825-0 | year=2000 | pages=14–15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = a_b \left\| \mathbf{b} \right\| = b_a \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| .&lt;/math&gt;
The dot product, defined in this manner, is homogeneous under scaling in each variable, meaning that for any scalar ''α'',
:&lt;math&gt; ( \alpha \mathbf{a} ) \cdot \mathbf b = \alpha ( \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b ) = \mathbf a \cdot ( \alpha \mathbf b ) .&lt;/math&gt;
It also satisfies a [[distributive law]], meaning that
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf a \cdot ( \mathbf b + \mathbf c ) = \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b + \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf c .&lt;/math&gt;

These properties may be summarized by saying that the dot product is a [[bilinear form]]. Moreover, this bilinear form is [[positive definite bilinear form|positive definite]], which means that 
&lt;math&gt; \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf a &lt;/math&gt;
is never negative and is zero if and only if &lt;math&gt; \mathbf a = \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;, the zero vector.

===Equivalence of the definitions===
If '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[standard basis|standard basis vectors]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then we may write
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf a &amp;= [a_1 , \dots , a_n] = \sum_i a_i \mathbf e_i \\
\mathbf b &amp;= [b_1 , \dots , b_n] = \sum_i b_i \mathbf e_i.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are an [[orthonormal basis]], which means that they have unit length and are at right angles to each other.  Hence since these vectors have unit length
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf e_i \cdot \mathbf e_i = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
and since they form right angles with each other, if {{nowrap|''i'' ≠ ''j''}},
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf e_i \cdot \mathbf e_j = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;
Thus in general we can say that:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf e_i \cdot \mathbf e_j = \delta_ {ij} .&lt;/math&gt;
Where δ &lt;sub&gt; ij &lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]].

Also, by the geometric definition, for any vector '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and a vector '''a''', we note
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf e_i = \left\| \mathbf a \right\| \, \left\| \mathbf e_i \right\| \cos \theta = \left\| \mathbf a \right\| \cos \theta = a_i ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the component of vector '''a''' in the direction of '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Now applying the distributivity of the geometric version of the dot product gives
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = \mathbf a \cdot \sum_i b_i \mathbf e_i = \sum_i b_i ( \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf e_i ) = \sum_i b_i a_i= \sum_i a_i b_i  ,&lt;/math&gt;
which is precisely the algebraic definition of the dot product.  So the geometric dot product equals the algebraic dot product.

==Properties==
The dot product fulfills the following properties if '''a''', '''b''', and '''c''' are real [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] and ''r'' is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]].&lt;ref name="Lipschutz2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel2009" /&gt;

# '''[[Commutative]]:'''
#: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} ,&lt;/math&gt;
#: which follows from the definition (''θ'' is the angle between '''a''' and '''b'''):
#: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| \left\| \mathbf{b} \right\| \cos \theta = \left\| \mathbf{b} \right\| \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| \cos \theta = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} .&lt;/math&gt;
# '''[[Distributive property|Distributive]] over vector addition:'''

#: &lt;math&gt; ( c_1 \mathbf{a} ) \cdot ( c_2 \mathbf{b} ) = c_1 c_2 ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} ) .&lt;/math&gt;

"Dot Product." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DotProduct.html&lt;/ref&gt; Note however that the previously mentioned scalar multiplication property is sometimes called the "associative law for scalar and dot product"&lt;ref name="BanchoffWermer1983"&gt;{{cite book|author1=T.

Wermer|title=Linear Algebra Through Geometry|year=1983|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4684-0161-5|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or one can say that "the dot product is associative with respect to scalar multiplication" because ''c'' ('''a''' ⋅ '''b''') = (''c'' '''a''') ⋅ '''b''' = '''a''' ⋅ (''c'' '''b''').&lt;ref name="BedfordFowler2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.

===Application to the law of cosines===
[[File:Dot product cosine rule.svg|100px|thumb|Triangle with vector edges '''a''' and '''b''', separated by angle ''θ''.]]

{{main|Law of cosines}}

Given two vectors '''a''' and '''b''' separated by angle ''θ'' (see image right), they form a triangle with a third side {{nowrap|1={{ font color | gold |'''c'''}} = {{ font color | red |'''a'''}} − {{ font color | blue |'''b'''}}}}. The dot product of this with itself is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{\color{gold}c} \cdot \mathbf{\color{gold}c}  &amp; = ( \mathbf{\color{red}a} - \mathbf{\color{blue}b}) \cdot ( \mathbf{\color{red}a} - \mathbf{\color{blue}b} ) \\
 &amp; = \mathbf{\color{red}a} \cdot \mathbf{\color{red}a} - \mathbf{\color{red}a} \cdot \mathbf{\color{blue}b} - \mathbf{\color{blue}b} \cdot \mathbf{\color{red}a} + \mathbf{\color{blue}b} \cdot \mathbf{\color{blue}b} \\
 &amp; = {\color{red}a}^2 - \mathbf{\color{red}a} \cdot \mathbf{\color{blue}b} - \mathbf{\color{red}a} \cdot \mathbf{\color{blue}b} + {\color{blue}b}^2 \\
 &amp; = {\color{red}a}^2 - 2 \mathbf{\color{red}a} \cdot \mathbf{\color{blue}b} + {\color{blue}b}^2 \\
 {\color{gold}c}^2 &amp; = {\color{red}a}^2 + {\color{blue}b}^2 - 2 {\color{red}a} {\color{blue}b} \cos {\color{purple}\theta} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is the [[law of cosines]].

There are two [[ternary operation]]s involving dot product and [[cross product]].

The '''scalar triple product''' of three vectors is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot ( \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} ) = \mathbf{b} \cdot ( \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a} )=\mathbf{c} \cdot ( \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} ).&lt;/math&gt;
Its value is the [[determinant]] of the matrix whose columns are the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the three vectors. It is the signed [[volume]] of the [[parallelogram]] defined by the three vectors.

The '''vector triple product''' is defined by&lt;ref name="Lipschutz2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel2009" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \times ( \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} ) = \mathbf{b} ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} ) - \mathbf{c} ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} ).&lt;/math&gt;
This identity, also known as ''Lagrange's formula'' [[mnemonic|may be remembered]] as "BAC minus CAB", keeping in mind which vectors are dotted together. This formula finds application in simplifying vector calculations in [[physics]].

==Physics==
In [[physics]], vector magnitude is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] in the physical sense, i.e. a [[physical quantity]] independent of the coordinate system, expressed as the [[product (mathematics)|product]]  of a [[number|numerical value]] and a [[physical unit]], not just a number. The dot product is also a scalar in this sense, given by the formula, independent of the coordinate system.  Examples include:&lt;ref name="Riley2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1=K.F. Riley |author2=M.P. Hobson |author3=S.J. Bence |title= Mathematical methods for physics and engineering|edition= 3rd|year= 2010|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=M. Mansfield |author2=C. O’Sullivan |title= Understanding Physics|edition= 4th |year= 2011|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-47-0746370}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mechanical work]] is the dot product of [[force]] and [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] vectors,
* [[Magnetic flux]] is the dot product of the [[magnetic field]] and the [[vector area]],
*[[Power (physics)|Power]] is the dot product of [[force]] and [[velocity]].

==Generalizations==

===Complex vectors===
For vectors with [[complex number|complex]] entries, using the given definition of the dot product would lead to quite different properties. For instance the dot product of a vector with itself would be an arbitrary complex number, and could be zero without the vector being the zero vector (such vectors are called [[Isotropic quadratic form|isotropic]]); this in turn would have consequences for notions like length and angle. Properties such as the positive-definite norm can be salvaged at the cost of giving up the symmetric and bilinear properties of the scalar product, through the alternative definition&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=287|first=Sterling K.|last=Berberian|title=Linear Algebra|year=2014|origyear=1992|publisher=Dover|isbn=978-0-486-78055-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipschutz2009" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum{\overline{a_i} b_i} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;''a''&lt;/span&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[complex conjugate]] of ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then the scalar product of any vector with itself is a non-negative real number, and it is nonzero except for the zero vector. However this scalar product is thus [[sesquilinear]] rather than bilinear: it is [[conjugate linear]] and not linear in '''a''', and the scalar product is not symmetric, since
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \overline{\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a}} .&lt;/math&gt;
The angle between two complex vectors is then given by
:&lt;math&gt; \cos \theta = \frac{\operatorname{Re} ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} )}{ \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| \, \left\| \mathbf{b} \right\| } .&lt;/math&gt;

This type of scalar product is nevertheless useful, and leads to the notions of [[Hermitian form]] and of general [[inner product space]]s.

===Inner product===
{{main|Inner product space}}
The inner product generalizes the dot product to [[vector space|abstract vector spaces]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]], being either the field of [[real number]]s &lt;math&gt; \R &lt;/math&gt; or the field of [[complex number]]s &lt;math&gt; \Complex &lt;/math&gt;. It is usually denoted using [[angular brackets]] by &lt;math&gt; \left\langle \mathbf{a} \, , \mathbf{b} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

The inner product of two vectors over the field of complex numbers is, in general, a complex number, and  is [[Sesquilinear form|sesquilinear]] instead of bilinear. An inner product space is a [[normed vector space]], and the inner product of a vector with itself is real and positive-definite.

===Functions===
The dot product is defined for vectors that have a finite number of [[coordinate vector|entries]]. Thus these vectors can be regarded as [[discrete function]]s: a length-{{math|''n''}} vector {{math|''u''}} is, then, a function with [[domain of a function|domain]] {{math|{''k'' ∈ ℕ ∣ 1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n''}}}, and {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a notation for the image of {{math|''i''}} by the function/vector {{math|''u''}}.

This notion can be generalized to [[continuous function]]s: just as the inner product on vectors uses a sum over corresponding components, the inner product on functions is defined as an integral over some [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|''a'' ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''b''}} (also denoted {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}):&lt;ref name="Lipschutz2009" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle u , v \right\rangle = \int_a^b u(x) v(x) d x &lt;/math&gt;

Generalized further to [[complex function]]s {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}} and {{math|''χ''(''x'')}}, by analogy with the complex inner product above, gives&lt;ref name="Lipschutz2009" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \psi , \chi \right\rangle = \int_a^b \psi(x) \overline{\chi(x)} d x .&lt;/math&gt;

===Weight function===
Inner products can have a [[weight function]], i.e. a function which weights each term of the inner product with a value.

===Dyadics and matrices===
[[Matrix (mathematics)|Matrices]] have the [[Frobenius inner product]], which is analogous to the vector inner product. It is defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding components of two matrices '''A''' and '''B''' having the same size:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} : \mathbf{B} = \sum_i \sum_j A_{ij} \overline{B_{ij}} = \mathrm{tr} ( \mathbf{B}^\mathrm{H} \mathbf{A} ) = \mathrm{tr} ( \mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}^\mathrm{H} ) .&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} : \mathbf{B} = \sum_i \sum_j A_{ij} B_{ij} = \mathrm{tr} ( \mathbf{B}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{A} ) = \mathrm{tr} ( \mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}^\mathrm{T} ) = \mathrm{tr} ( \mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{B} ) = \mathrm{tr} ( \mathbf{B} \mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T} ) .&lt;/math&gt; (For real matrices)

[[Dyadics]] have a dot product and "double" dot product defined on them, see [[Dyadics#Product of dyadic and dyadic|Dyadics (Product of dyadic and dyadic)]] for their definitions.

===Tensors===
The inner product between a [[tensor]] of order ''n'' and a tensor of order ''m'' is a tensor of order {{nowrap|''n'' + ''m'' − 2}}, see [[tensor contraction]] for details.

==Computation==

===Algorithms===

The straightforward algorithm for calculating a floating-point dot product of vectors can suffer from [[catastrophic cancellation]]. To avoid this, approaches such as the [[Kahan summation algorithm]] are used.

===Libraries===
A dot product function is included in [[BLAS]] level 1.

'''Earth Economics''' is a [[501c3]] non-profit headquartered in [[Tacoma, Washington]], United States. The organization uses natural [[capital valuation]] to help decision makers and local stakeholders understand the value of [[natural capital]] assets. By identifying, monetizing, and valuing natural capital and [[ecosystem services]], Earth Economics helps communities and organizations make sound investment and policy decisions that mitigate risk, add value, and build [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]]. The organization has a small in-house staff of [[economists]] that collaborate with experts in [[economics]], [[ecology]], [[hydrology]], [[policy]] and [[systems modeling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eartheconomics.org|title=Home|website=Earth Economics|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==

Earth Economics' current mission states, "We quantify and value the benefits nature provides. Our work drives effective decisions and systemic change through a combination of education, natural capital analysis, and policy recommendations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eartheconomics.org/vision/|title=Mission and Vision|website=Earth Economics|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its website, Earth Economics offers "a pragmatic, collaborative approach to help organizations make sound investment and policy decisions that mitigate risk, add value, and build resilience by taking nature into account."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eartheconomics.org/what-we-do|title=What We Do|website=Earth Economics|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization currently focuses on the global and regional priorities of working lands, freshwater, oceans, forests, and communities.

Earth Economics offers five types of services: 
* Workshops &amp; Trainings: Earth Economics offers hands-on workshops, trainings, and presentations that aim to raise awareness about ecological economics concepts and cost-effective solutions that build resilience, [[biodiversity]], and equity. 
* Ecosystem Services Valuation: Earth Economics is best known for their expertise in natural capital valuation. The Ecosystem Valuation Toolkit (EVT), an expanding and searchable database of ecosystem service values, serves as the foundation for these analyses. 
* Benefit-Cost Analysis: Earth Economics’ benefit-cost analysis framework expands traditional cost-benefit equations to include ecosystem services and other factors including health, recreation, and effects on culture and community. 
* Industry Analysis: Earth Economics works with businesses and economic development agencies to reduce risk, improve the efficiency of operations, reduce [[carbon footprint]], and expand job opportunities. 
* Finance &amp; Investment Strategies: Earth Economics works with organizations to develop innovative approaches and practical financing strategies to preserve, enhance, or restore natural capital assets, including [[conservation lands]], [[green infrastructure]], working forests and farms, and [[green building]]s.

==History==

Originally known as the Asia-Pacific Environmental Exchange (APEX), the organization was founded as a project of [[The Tides Center]]. The initial co-founders were David Batker, Jim Puckett, [[Annie Leonard]], Joshua Farley, Joshua Reyneveld, and Isabel De La Torre. Earth Economics evolved into an autonomous organization and received IRS [[501(c)3]] tax exempt, public charity status in March 2006.

From 2006 until 2016, co-founder David Batker acted as Earth Economics' Executive Director and Chief Economist. In 2016, Batker moved to a joint President and Chief Economist position. Batker's research and advocacy focuses on the value that natural systems have in providing food, water, flood risk reduction, climate stabilization, and other benefits. His work has been used to establish the value of watersheds and new funding mechanisms for maintaining natural capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/study-puts-price-on-puget-sound/|title=Study puts price on Puget Sound|date=2008-07-25|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth Economics has a track record of working alongside NGOs, businesses, and governmental organizations to inform investment and shift local and international policy in ways that account for the benefits of ecosystem services. Since 2013, Earth Economics has been working to incorporate ecosystem services in federal benefit-cost analysis and accounting practices.

A variety of [[symbol]]s or iconographic conventions are used to represent '''[[:wikt:Earth|Earth]]''', either in the sense of [[Earth|planet Earth]], or the [[world|inhabited world]]. Representations of the [[globe]] of Earth, either with an indication of the shape of the [[continents]] or with a representation of [[longitude|meridians]] and [[Latitude|parallels]] remains a common pictographic convention to express the notion of "worldwide, global". The modern [[astronomical symbol]] for Earth as a [[planet]] uses either a stylized [[globus cruciger]] ({{resize|150%|♁}}) or a circle with a cross (representing the equator and one meridian; ({{resize|150%|🜨}}).&lt;ref name=penny-cyclopaedia&gt;{{cite book| title = The Penny cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge | volume = 22 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rJhOFg1yiqUC&amp;pg=PA197| publisher = C.

==History==

[[File:Diagrammatic T-O world map - 12th c.jpg|thumb|12th-century T-and-O representation of the world.]]

The earliest type of symbols are [[allegory|allegories]], personifications or deifications, mostly in the form of an [[Earth goddess]] (in the case of [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian mythology]] a god, [[Geb]]).

&lt;div&gt;Before the recognition of the [[spherical Earth|spherical shape]] of the Earth in the [[Hellenistic period]], the main attribute of the Earth was its being ''flat''. The [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] for "earth, land" depicts a stretch of flat alluvial land with grains of sand ([[Gardiner's sign list|Gardiner]] N16  &lt;hiero&gt;N16&lt;/hiero&gt;). Similarly, the Sumerian [[cuneiform|cuneiform sign]] for "earth" [[KI (cuneiform)|KI]] ({{resize|150%|𒆠}} U+121A0) originates as a picture of a "threshing floor". &lt;/div&gt;

The [[Earth (classical element)|classical element]] "Earth" is represented by the trigram of three broken lines in the [[I Ching]] ({{resize|150%|☷}} U+2637). The Western (early modern) [[alchemical symbol]] is a downward-pointing triangle bisected by a horizontal line.
Other symbols for the earth in alchemy or mysticism include the square and the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi, Jolande, ''Complex/Archetype/Symbol In The Psychology Of C G Jung'', Routledge (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=p8FdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=P146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 146],  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=p8FdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q=earth&amp;f=false 169].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]], the [[globe]], a representation of the spherical Earth, became the main symbol representing the concept.
The globe depicted the "universe" (pictured as the [[celestial sphere]]) as well as the Earth.
The [[globus cruciger]] is the globe surmounted by a [[Christian cross]], held by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperors]] on the one hand to represent the [[Christendom|Christian]] [[ecumene]], on the other hand the [[Akakia]] represented the mortal nature of all men.
In the medieval period, the [[Early world maps|known world]] was also represented by the [[T and O map|T-and-O]] figure, representing an extremely simplified [[world map]] of the three classical continents of the [[Old World]], viz. ''[[Western Asia|Asia]], [[Continental Europe|Europe]]'' and ''[[Ancient Libya|Africa]]''.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary ethics''' is a field of inquiry that explores how evolutionary theory might bear on our understanding of [[ethics]] or [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;William Fitzpatrick, "Morality and Evolutionary Biology." ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Available online at: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-biology/.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of issues investigated by evolutionary ethics is quite broad. Supporters of evolutionary ethics have claimed that it has important implications in the fields of [[descriptive ethics]], [[normative ethics]], and [[metaethics]].

Descriptive evolutionary ethics consists of biological approaches to morality based on the alleged role of [[evolution]] in shaping human [[psychology]] and behavior. Such approaches may be based in scientific fields such as [[evolutionary psychology]], [[sociobiology]], or [[ethology]], and seek to explain certain human moral behaviors, capacities, and tendencies in evolutionary terms. For example, the nearly universal belief that incest is morally wrong might be explained as an evolutionary adaptation that furthered human survival.

Normative (or prescriptive) evolutionary ethics, by contrast, seeks not to explain moral behavior, but to justify or debunk certain normative ethical theories or claims. For instance, some proponents of normative evolutionary ethics have argued that evolutionary theory undermines certain widely held views of humans' moral superiority over other animals.

Evolutionary metaethics asks how evolutionary theory bears on theories of ethical discourse, the question of whether objective moral values exist, and the possibility of objective moral knowledge. For example, some evolutionary ethicists have appealed to evolutionary theory to defend various forms of moral anti-realism (the claim, roughly, that objective moral facts do not exist) and moral skepticism.

==History==
The first notable attempt to explore links between evolution and ethics was made by [[Charles Darwin]] in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871). In Chapters IV and V of that work Darwin set out to explain the origin of human morality in order to show that there was no absolute gap between man and animals. Darwin sought to show how a refined moral sense, or conscience, could have developed through a natural evolutionary process that began with social instincts rooted in our nature as social animals.

Not long after the publication of Darwin's ''The Descent of Man'', evolutionary ethics took a very different—and far more dubious—turn in the form of [[Social Darwinism]]. Leading Social Darwinists such as [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[William Graham Sumner]] sought to apply the lessons of biological evolution to social and political life. Just as in nature, they claimed, progress occurs through a ruthless process of competitive struggle and "survival of the fittest," so human progress will occur only if government allows unrestricted business competition and makes no effort to protect the "weak" or "unfit" by means of social welfare laws.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Bassham, ''The Philosophy Book: From the Vedas to the New Atheists, 250 Milestones in the History of Philosophy''. New York: Sterling, 2015, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics such as [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]] roundly criticized such attempts to draw ethical and political lessons from Darwinism, and by the early decades of the twentieth century Social Darwinism was widely viewed as discredited.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hofstadter, ''Social Darwinism in American Thought'', rev. ed. Boston: Beacon Press, 1955, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern revival of evolutionary ethics owes much to E. O. Wilson's 1975 book, ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis''. In that work, Wilson argues that there is a genetic basis for a wide variety of human and nonhuman social behaviors. In recent decades, evolutionary ethics has become a lively topic of debate in both scientific and philosophical circles.

==Descriptive evolutionary ethics==
{{See also|Evolution of morality}}
The most widely accepted form of evolutionary ethics is descriptive evolutionary ethics. Descriptive evolutionary ethics seeks to explain various kinds of moral phenomena wholly or partly in genetic terms. Ethical topics addressed include altruistic behaviors, an innate sense of fairness, a capacity for normative guidance, feelings of kindness or love, self-sacrifice, incest-avoidance, parental care, in-group loyalty, monogamy, feelings related to competitiveness and [[Retributive justice|retribution]], moral "cheating," and [[hypocrisy]].

A key issue in evolutionary psychology has been how altruistic feelings and behaviors could have evolved, in both humans and nonhumans, when the process of natural selection is based on the multiplication over time only of those genes that adapt better to changes in the environment of the species. Theories addressing this have included [[kin selection]], [[group selection]], and [[reciprocal altruism]] (both direct and indirect, and on a society-wide scale). Descriptive evolutionary ethicists have also debated whether various types of moral phenomena should be seen as adaptations which have evolved because of their direct adaptive benefits, or spin-offs that evolved as side-effects of adaptive behaviors.

==Normative evolutionary ethics==
Normative evolutionary ethics is the most controversial branch of evolutionary ethics. Normative evolutionary ethics aims at defining which acts are right or wrong, and which things are good or bad, in evolutionary terms. It is not merely ''describing'', but it is ''prescribing'' goals, values and obligations. [[Social Darwinism]], discussed above, is the most historically influential version of normative evolutionary ethics. As philosopher [[G. E. Moore]] famously argued, many early versions of normative evolutionary ethics seemed to commit a logical mistake that Moore dubbed the ''naturalistic fallacy''. This was the mistake of defining a normative property, such as goodness, in terms of some non-normative, naturalistic property, such as pleasure or survival.

More sophisticated forms of normative evolutionary ethics need not commit either the naturalistic fallacy or the is-ought fallacy. But all varieties of normative evolutionary ethics face the difficult challenge of explaining how evolutionary facts can have normative authority for rational agents. "Regardless of why one has a given trait, the question for a rational agent is always: is it right for me to exercise it, or should I instead renounce and resist it as far as I am able?"&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, "Morality and Evolutionary Biology," Section 3.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary metaethics ==
Evolutionary theory may not be able to tell us what is morally right or wrong, but it might be able to illuminate our use of moral language, or to cast doubt on the existence of objective moral facts or the possibility of moral knowledge. Evolutionary ethicists such as [[Michael Ruse]], [[E. O. Wilson]], [[Richard Joyce (philosopher)|Richard Joyce]], and [[Sharon Street]] have defended such claims.

Some philosophers who support evolutionary meta-ethics use it to undermine views of human well-being that rely upon Aristotelian [[teleology]], or other goal-directed accounts of human flourishing. A number of thinkers have appealed to evolutionary theory in an attempt to debunk [[moral realism]] or support moral skepticism. Sharon Street is one prominent ethicist who argues that evolutionary psychology undercuts moral realism. According to Street, human moral decision-making is "thoroughly saturated" with evolutionary influences. Natural selection, she argues, would have rewarded moral dispositions that increased fitness, not ones that track moral truths, should they exist. It would be a remarkable and unlikely coincidence if "morally blind" ethical traits aimed solely at survival and reproduction aligned closely with independent moral truths. So we cannot be confident that our moral beliefs accurately track objective moral truth. Consequently, realism forces us to embrace moral skepticism. Such skepticism, Street claims, is implausible. So we should reject realism and instead embrace some antirealist view that allows for rationally justified moral beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Street, "A Darwinian Dilemma for Realist Theories of Value." ''Philosophical Studies'', 127: 109-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of moral realism have offered two sorts of replies. One is to deny that evolved moral responses would likely diverge sharply from moral truth. According to David Copp, for example, evolution would favor moral responses that promote social peace, harmony, and cooperation. But such qualities are precisely those that lie at the core of any plausible theory of objective moral truth. So Street's alleged "dilemma"—deny evolution or embrace moral skepticism—is a false choice.&lt;ref&gt;David Copp, "Darwinian Skepticism about Moral Realism." ''Philosophical Issues'', 18: 186-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second response to Street is to deny that morality is as "saturated" with evolutionary influences as Street claims. William Fitzpatrick, for instance, argues that "[e]ven if there is significant evolutionary influence on the content of many of our moral beliefs, it remains possible that many of our moral beliefs are arrived at partly (or in some cases wholly) through autonomous moral reflection and reasoning, just as with our mathematical, scientific and philosophical beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, "Morality and Evolutionary Biology," Section 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The wide variability of moral codes, both across cultures and historical time periods, is difficult to explain if morality is as pervasively shaped by genetic factors as Street claims.

Another common argument evolutionary ethicists use to debunk moral realism is to claim that the success of evolutionary psychology in explaining human ethical responses makes the notion of moral truth "explanatorily superfluous." If we can fully explain, for example, why parents naturally love and care for their children in purely evolutionary terms, there is no need to invoke any "spooky" realist moral truths to do any explanatory work. Thus, for reasons of theoretical simplicity we should not posit the existence of such truths and, instead, should explain the widely held belief in objective moral truth as "an illusion fobbed off on us by our genes in order to get us to cooperate with one another (so that our genes survive)."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ruse and E. O. Wilson, "The Evolution of Ethics." ''New Scientist'', 102: 1478 (17 October 1985): 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here again the central question is whether the influence of evolution on morality is as pervasive as the critics of moral realism claim. If, as seems likely, there are important aspects of morality that cannot be explained in genetic terms, appeals to moral truth may not be explanatory fifth-wheels.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2016}}

In [[physics]], '''exotic matter''' is [[matter]] that somehow deviates from normal matter and has "exotic" properties. A broader definition of exotic matter is any kind of non-baryonic matter—that is not made of [[baryons]], the subatomic particles (such as [[protons]] and [[neutrons]]) of which ordinary matter is composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/exotic_matter.html|title=Exotic matter|publisher=[[daviddarling.info]]|accessdate=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exotic mass has been considered a colloquial term for matters such as [[dark matter]], [[negative mass]], or [[Mass#Tachyonic particles and imaginary (complex) mass|complex mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4517897/nobel-prize-physics-2016/|title=Why 'Exotic Matter' Matters—and Won the Nobel Prize in Physics|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4517897/nobel-prize-physics-2016/|title=Why 'Exotic Matter' Matters—and Won the Nobel Prize in Physics|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/scitech/science/356829/physicists-confirm-existence-of-new-exotic-matter/story/|title=Physicists confirm existence of new 'exotic' matter|work=GMA News Online|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/8012-exotic-antimatter-created-earth.html|title=Exotic Antimatter Created on Earth|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/supplements/insights/exoticmatter/index.html|title=Exotic matter  : Insight : Nature|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anonymous|date=1998-08-03|title=Focus: Wormhole Construction: Proceed with Caution|url=https://physics.aps.org/story/v2/st7|journal=Physics|language=en-US|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of exotic matter==
There are several types of exotic matter:

* Hypothetical [[subatomic particle|particles]] and states of matter that have "exotic" [[physical property|physical properties]] that would violate known [[laws of physics]], such as a particle having a [[negative mass]].
* [[Hypothetical particle]]s and states of matter that have not yet been encountered, but whose properties would be within the realm of mainstream physics if found to exist. 
* Several particles whose existence has been experimentally confirmed that are conjectured to be [[exotic hadron]]s and within the [[Standard Model]].
* [[State of matter|States of matter]] that are not commonly encountered, such as [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, [[fermionic condensate]]s, [[quantum spin liquid]], [[string-net liquid]], [[supercritical fluid]], [[color-glass condensate]],  [[quark–gluon plasma]], [[Rydberg matter]], [[Rydberg polaron]] and [[photonic matter]] but whose properties are entirely within the realm of mainstream physics.
* States of matter that are poorly understood, such as [[Dark matter]] and [[Mirror matter]].
* Ordinary matter placed under [[high pressure]], which may result in dramatic changes in its physical or chemical properties.
* [[Degenerate matter]]
* [[Exotic atoms]]

== Negative mass ==
{{main article|Negative mass}}

Negative mass would possess some strange properties, such as accelerating in the direction opposite of applied [[force]]. Despite being inconsistent with the expected behavior of "normal" matter, negative mass is mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of [[conservation of momentum]] or [[conservation of energy|energy]]. It is used in certain speculative theories, such as on the construction of artificial [[wormhole]]s and the [[Alcubierre drive]]. The closest known real representative of such exotic matter is the region of pseudo-[[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative-pressure]] density produced by the [[Casimir effect]].

According to [[mass–energy equivalence]], mass  &lt;math&gt;m &lt;/math&gt; is in proportion to energy  &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and the coefficient of proportionality is &lt;math&gt;c^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Actually,  &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is still equivalent to  &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; although the coefficient is another constant &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wang, Z.Y |author2=Wang P.Y |author3=Xu Y.R | date=2011 | title=Crucial experiment to resolve Abraham-Minkowski Controversy | journal=Optik | volume=122 | pages=1994–1996 | doi=10.1016/j.ijleo.2010.12.018 | issue= 22|bibcode = 2011Optik.122.1994W |arxiv=1103.3559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as &lt;math&gt;-c^2 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, Z.Y.|title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2016|volume=11|pages=503–508|doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it is unnecessary to introduce a [[negative energy]] because the mass can be negative although the energy is positive. That is to say,

:&lt;math&gt;E=-mc^2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m= -\frac{E}{c^2}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

Under the circumstances，

:&lt;math&gt;dE=Fds=\frac{dp}{dt}ds=\frac{ds}{dt}dp=vdp=vd(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-c^2dm=vd(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-c^2(2m)dm=2mvd(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-c^2d(m^2)=d(m^2v^2)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-m^2c^2=m^2v^2+C&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;C=-m_0^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently,

:&lt;math&gt;-m^2c^2=m^2v^2-m_0^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m={m_0\over \sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; is [[invariant mass]] and [[invariant energy]] equals &lt;math&gt;E_0=-m_0 c^2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  The squared mass is still positive and the particle can be stable.

Since &lt;math&gt;m= {m_0\over \sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;p=mv= {m_0 v\over \sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

The [[negative momentum]] is applied to explain [[negative refraction]], [[inverse Doppler effect]] and [[reverse Cherenkov effect]] observed in a [[negative index metamaterial]]. The [[radiation pressure]] in the [[metamaterial]] is also negative&lt;ref name="Veselago1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veselago|first=V. G.|title=The electrodynamics of substances with simultaneously negative values of permittivity and permeability|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|year=1968|volume=10|issue=4|pages=509–514 |doi=10.1070/PU1968v010n04ABEH003699|bibcode = 1968SvPhU..10..509V }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the force is defined as &lt;math&gt;F=\frac{dp}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. [[Pressure#Negative pressures|Negative pressure]] exists in [[dark energy]] too. Using these above equations, the [[energy-momentum relation]] should be

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the [[Planck-Einstein relation]] &lt;math&gt;E=\hbar\omega&lt;/math&gt; and [[de Broglie]]'s &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar k&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the following [[dispersion relation]] 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 =- k^2c^2+ \omega_p^2&lt;/math&gt;,    &lt;math&gt;(E_0=\hbar\omega_p=-m_0c^2&gt;0)&lt;/math&gt;

of the wave consists of a stream of particles whose [[energy-momentum relation]] is &lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt;([[wave–particle duality]]) can be excited in a [[negative index metamaterial]].The velocity of such a particle is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;v=c\sqrt{\frac{E_0^2}{E^2}-1}=c\sqrt{\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

and range is from zero to infinity

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}&lt;2&lt;/math&gt;,      &lt;math&gt;v&lt;c&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;,      &lt;math&gt;v&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the [[kinetic energy]] is also negative

:&lt;math&gt;E_k = E-E_0=-mc^2-(-m_0 c^2)=-{m_0c^2\over\sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}} + m_0 c^2= m_0 c^2 (1-{1\over\sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}})&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;(m_0&lt;0)&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, the [[negative kinetic energy]] exists in some models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Caldwell, R.R.|title=A phantom menace? Cosmological consequences of a dark energy component with super-negative equation of state|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=545|pages=23–29|date=2002|doi=10.1016/S0370-2693(02)02589-3|issue=1–2|arxiv = astro-ph/9908168 |bibcode = 2002PhLB..545...23C }}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe [[dark energy]] ([[phantom energy]]) whose pressure is negative. In this way, the [[negative mass]] of exotic matter is now associated with [[negative momentum]], [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]], negative kinetic energy and FTL ([[faster-than-light]]).

== Complex mass ==
{{Main article|Tachyon#Mass}}

A hypothetical particle with [[Complex number|complex]] rest mass would always travel faster than the [[speed of light]]. Such particles are called [[tachyon]]s. There is no confirmed existence of tachyons.

: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{m\cdot c^2}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{\left|\mathbf{v}\right|^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

If the rest mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is complex this implies that the denominator is complex because the total energy is [[observable]] and thus must be [[real number|real]]. Therefore, the quantity under the square root must be negative, which can only happen if [[speed|''v'']] is greater than [[speed of light|''c'']]. As noted by [[Gregory Benford]] ''et al.,'' [[special relativity]] implies that tachyons, if they existed, could be used to communicate backwards in time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G. A. Benford |author2=D. L. Book |author3=W. A. Newcomb |year=1970|title=The Tachyonic Antitelephone|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=2 |page=263|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.2.263|bibcode = 1970PhRvD...2..263B }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[tachyonic antitelephone]]). Because [[time travel]] is considered to be non-physical, tachyons are believed by physicists either not to exist, or else to be incapable of interacting with normal matter.

In quantum field theory, complex mass would induce [[tachyon condensation]].

== Materials at high pressure ==
At high pressure, materials such as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) in the presence of an excess of either chlorine or sodium were transformed into compounds "forbidden" by classical chemistry, such as {{chem|Na|3|Cl}} and {{chem|Na|Cl|3}}. Quantum mechanical calculations predict the possibility of other compounds, such as {{chem|Na|Cl|7}}, {{chem|Na|3|Cl|2}} and {{chem|Na|2|Cl}}. The materials are thermodynamically stable at high pressures. Such compounds may exist in natural environments that exist at high pressure, such as the deep ocean or inside planetary cores. The materials have potentially useful properties. For instance, {{chem|Na|3|Cl}} is a two-dimensional metal, made of layers of pure sodium and salt that can conduct electricity. The salt layers act as insulators while the sodium layers act as conductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/scientists-create-forbidden-compounds-table-salt/30520/ |title=Scientists turn table salt into forbidden compounds that violate textbook rules |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = W. | last2 = Oganov | first2 = A.

To reach influencer status one should obtain at least 10,000 followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.olapic.com/resources/consumers-follow-listen-trust-influencers_article/|title=Why Consumers Follow, Listen to, and Trust Influencers {{!}} Olapic|work=Olapic {{!}} Visual Commerce &amp; Marketing Platform|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Spring 2017|title=Influencer Isse: Power Girls.

Maxi influencers have more than 20,000 and less than 1 million followers. Mega influencers have more than 1 million followers.

Business magazine [[Forbes]] identified fashion influencers as "the new [[celebrity endorsement]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s". However, influencers seem to have a closer relationship with their audience than traditional celebrities. As marketers [[Jung von Matt]], Brandnew IO and Facelift point out: "Daily interactions across multiple channels, through photos, stories or live sessions, create a form of closeness and trust" that make influencers "often more tangible than traditional celebrities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.influencer-secrets.com/|title=The Influencer Secrets|website=Influencer Secrets – A Study on the Motivation &amp; Drive of Influencers|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Forbes]] named [[Chiara Ferragni]], [[Danielle Bernstein]], Julia Engel, Gabi Gregg, [[Jenn Im]], [[Susanna Lau]], Nicolette Mason, [[Simone Zippi Stardust]], Aimee Song and Bryan Yambao ([[Bryanboy]]) the top influencers in the fashion category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/top-influencers/fashion/#331e64954552|title=Top Influencers of 2017: Fashion|website=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the beginning of 2000, [[fashion blog]]s appeared to be amateurish personal areas. They were created as a hobby by fashion lovers to share their ideas of the latest trends or to get a job in the traditional fashion industry later on.&lt;ref name="Spedding"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/meet-fashions-super-influencers-the-women-with-the-power-to-char/|title=Meet fashion's super-influencers: the women with the power to charge £58,000 for one Instagram post|last=Spedding|first=Emma|date=2016-10-06|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing reach, bloggers learned to monetize their contents. As Pedroni remarks: “fashion blogs evolved from personal diaries kept by fashion lovers, into sophisticated marketing and economic tools”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pedroni|first=Marco|date=2016|title=Meso-celebrities, fashion and the media: How digital influencers struggle for visibility|url=|journal=Film, Fashion &amp; Consumption|volume=5|pages=103–121|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, new social media platforms such as [[Instagram]], [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube|Youtube]] spread. They enabled bloggers to reach a greater audience and have an even closer relationship with their existing readership.&lt;ref name="Spedding"/&gt; In fact, some bloggers closed their blogs as traffic moved to other platforms such as Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/what-is-an-influencer|title=What Is An Influencer?|last=Harris|first=Sarah|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to researcher Emily Hund “Social media’s influencer economy has gained steam quickly in the last few years, particularly on platforms like Instagram and Pinterest, whose image-heavy nature easily lends itself to commerce”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hund|first=Emily|date=2017-07-28|title=Measured Beauty: Exploring the aesthetics of Instagram's fashion influencers|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3097286.3097330|publisher=ACM|pages=44|doi=10.1145/3097286.3097330|isbn=9781450348478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media also gave rise to influencers who did not have a blog in the first place. [[Jenn Im]] became a fashion influencer due to her successful Youtube channel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/top-influencers/fashion/#16bcb9294552),%20Pamela%20Reif%20due%20to%20her%20high%20reach%20on%20Instagram%20(http://aboutpam.com/about|title=Top Influencers of 2017: Fashion|website=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; German influencer Pamela Reif due to her high reach on Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/1.5065754|title=Pamela Reif: Fitness-Model und Instagram-Phänomen|last=Wittershagen|first=Michael|date=2017-06-23|work=FAZ.NET|access-date=2018-02-24|last2=Hamburg|language=de|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Instagram was the social media platform with the highest reach for fashion influencers. [[Forbes]] calculated that the top ten fashion influencers combined generated a reach of 23,3 million on Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/top-influencers/fashion/#16bcb9294552|title=Top Influencers of 2017: Fashion|website=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the fashion industry had the highest share on Instagram influencer marketing in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.influencer-secrets.com|title=The Influencer Secrets|website=Influencer Secrets – A Study on the Motivation &amp; Drive of Influencers|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It’s share, approximately 61 percent, dominated by far subsequent sectors investing in influencer marketing such as travel (8 percent) and food and drinks (7 percent). The fashion industry spends around €1 billion on sponsored Instagram posts per year.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Business ==
Fashion influencers generate income through brand co-operations and affiliate links.&lt;ref name="Marco 2018"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1013881756|title=Einstieg in das Influencer Marketing : Grundlagen, Strategien und Erfolgsfaktoren|last=Marco|first=Nirschl,|date=2018|others=Steinberg, Laurina|isbn=9783658197452|location=Wiesbaden|oclc=1013881756}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principle sources of income are brand co-operations in terms of product placement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fashion influencers are paid to pose with specific products on their social media channels and must mark them correspondingly.

The economic value of a fashion influencer is most commonly measured by number of followers. Other key aspects are demographics of their followers, engagement rate and fit between influencer and brand.&lt;ref name="Marco 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; The latter is the necessary precondition for influencers to work with a brand.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; As thousands of people follow them for their authentic personality and style, influencers must be able to identify themselves with the brand in order to recommend it convincingly. Many influencers claim to work exclusively with brands they really like and would recommend in private as well. Influencer Camille Charrière reportedly turned down a 5-digit offer of Macy’s, because she could not identify with the clothes: “At the end of the day, I’m selling my taste and my eye – if I do things off-brand I will lose the respect”.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

=== Benefits for fashion influencers ===
Successful fashion influencers generate an income through their social media activities that enables them to quit their jobs and focus solely on their social media career. German fashion influencer Xenia van der Woodsen (xeniaoverdose) left her full-time job at an investment trust, when she realized that she could earn more money with a single Instagram post than working a full day in a regular job.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2017/34/xenia-van-der-woodsen-instagram-influencer-geld|title=Xenia van der Woodsen: Über Geld spricht man nicht|last=Levy|first=Sarah|date=2017-08-21|work=Die Zeit|access-date=2018-02-25|language=de-DE|issn=0044-2070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until fashion influencer Danielle Bernstein spoke out on her mid-six figures income in 2015, financial information about the influencer business were relatively rare and inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Harper's BAZAAR"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a10949/how-bloggers-make-money-on-instagram/|title=How Bloggers Make Money On Instagram|date=2015-05-20|work=Harper's BAZAAR|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a study of Jung von Matt, Brandnew IO and Facelift revealed that such a high income is relatively rare among influencers.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Only eight out of the 1,200 interviewed influencers earn in average between $10,000 – 25,000 per campaign and only three of them more than $25,000. Albeit the “leading fashion influencers in Germany make over one million in revenue each year”, the majority makes less than $1,000 per campaign.

A majority of influencers receive a salary. Solely a minority of 20 percent makes brand co-operations in exchange for giveaways.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The salary primarily depends on the number of followers.&lt;ref name="Harper's BAZAAR"/&gt; The higher the follower number, the higher the salary range. The price for a cooperation depends also on the contract terms, for example if it concerns a one-time Instagram post or a long-term partnership including several posts. Xenia van der Woodsen, one of Germany’s top three fashion influencers in 2017,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; accepts only long-term brand co-operations in the majority of cases.&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt; In her experience, posts of long-term campaigns appear more authentic and credible, whereas single paid content pieces stand out as advertisement.

==== Affiliate links ====
Affiliate links enable fashion influencers to earn money on commission. The procedure was introduced by Amber Venz Box in 2011 with her rewardStyle program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sboyd/2014/09/30/rewardstyle-and-liketoknowit-founder-amber-venz-box-is-changing-the-retailing-industr/#77e40fdef11f|title=RewardStyle And LIKEtoKNOWit Founder Amber Venz Box Is Changing The Retailing Industry|last=Boyd|first=Sarah|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; RewardStyle enables selected bloggers to place individual links on their blog posts that lead consumers to a website where they can directly shop the look. If a costumer buys something in the shop, the influencer gets a sales commission. When lots of traffic started to shift to Instagram, this technique did not work anymore, because Instagram did not allow links in post descriptions and images. Bonx created a new app for Instagram, Snapchat and Pinterest in 2014 – LIKEtoKNOW.it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/how-these-3-tech-companies-revamped-their-products-to-improve-the-customer-experience/|title=How These 3 Tech Companies Revamped Their Products to Improve the Customer Experience|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since March 2017, users can take a screenshot of an influencer's picture and LIKEtoKNOW.it delivers the ready-to-shop product details via the app.

=== Benefits for fashion brands ===
Fashion brands use the reach and positive reputation of influencers by implementing [[influencer marketing]]. Influencers spread brand messages, increase brand awareness, contribute to a positive brand image and increase sales by tagging fashion brands in their posts.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Although data that shows the direct correlation between influencer campaigns and sales are rare, the success of affiliate platforms as rewardStyle and successful examples such as the #mangogirls campaign, indicate that influencer engagement affects sales. In the #mangogirls campaign several influencers had independently chosen the same coat as their favorite piece of the Mango collection and showcased it on Instagram.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; The coat went viral and sold-out. In fact, first studies show that every third consumer has already bought a product following the recommendation of an influencer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171214005418/en/Survey-Consumers-Swayed-Social-Influencers-Purchase-Product|title=Survey: Nearly One Third of Consumers Have Been Swayed by Social Influencers to Purchase a Product or Service|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Fashion influencers have been criticized by journalists for their lack of transparency on [[sponsored post]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/05/social-media-stars-breaching-rules-on-promoting-brands-watchdog-says-instagram-twitter|title=Social media stars breaching rules on promoting brands, watchdog says|last=Marsh|first=Sarah|date=2017-10-05|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lines between posts in which influencers share product recommendations for free or because they are paid for it are often blurred.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-14/instagram-to-make-it-clearer-when-influencer-posts-are-paid-ads|title=Instagram to Make It Clearer When Influencer Posts Are Paid Ads|date=2017-06-14|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influencers are supposed to mark a sponsored post with hashtags such as #ad or #sponsored, but often use less-obvious hashtags like #sp or non at all.

Due to this lack of transparency, the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) sent out dozens of warning letters to Instagram influencers in the beginning of 2017, giving further indications to influencers and marketers on how to disclose advertising and sponsored posts. Following the rules of the FTC, hashtags like #ad have to appear before the "more" button and are not allowed to be buried in a flood of other hashtags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/04/ftc-staff-reminds-influencers-brands-clearly-disclose|title=FTC Staff Reminds Influencers and Brands to Clearly Disclose Relationship|date=2017-04-18|work=Federal Trade Commission|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "anyone endorsing a brand must "clearly and conspicuously" declare connections to it, for example if products have been given free, if a payment has been made for the endorsement or if there is a business or family relationship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39650580|title=Celebrities warned over Instagram ads|date=2017-04-20|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in June 2017, Instagram launched a new disclosure system with which users can tag sponsors in a post. If the brand confirms the commercial relation, the post is marked with a "paid partnership" tag at the top&lt;ref name="Bloomberg.com"/&gt;

'''Female perversion''' is a term coined by [[Estela V. Welldon]] in 1992 to refer to women who commit violence, either against themselves or against others.&lt;ref name=Welldon&gt;Welldon, E.V. 1991 ''Psychology and psychopathology in women - a psychoanalytic perspective'', '''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]''' 158 pg 85-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Madonna&gt;[[Estela V. Welldon|Welldon, E.V.]] 1992 ''Mother, Madonna, Whore: The Idealization and Denigration of Motherhood'' [[Free Association Books]], 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the term can be used [[pejorative]]ly and sometimes has sexual connotations, its strict definition is an instance of [[human behavior]] that deviates from what is considered [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] or [[normality (behavior)|normal]], and it is in this sense that the term is used by psychologists. The term is also controversial as according to Welldon there is a prevailing denial of the existence of female violence, throughout the legal and mental health community.&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body {{ISBN|978-0415126755}}'' pg 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model of female perversion==
Welldon (1992)&lt;ref name="Madonna" /&gt; put forward a model of female perversion that introduced the term into the psychological nomenclature. The model covers several categories of violent behavior that can be directed at one's own body, against children, or against adults.

Freudian psychoanalytic theory suggested that perversion fell solely within the male domain, that it was related to the [[phallus]], and that aggressive drive was unique to men. In her book ''Madonna, Whore: The Idealisation and Denigration of Motherhood'',&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt; Welldon challenges this notion, and argues that women are equally capable of perversion. Though they do not use the [[penis]] with violence, they instead use the whole body.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In doing so, they attack the whole body, and sometimes by extension the bodies of children. They are symbolically wreaking revenge on their own internalised, often cruel and perverse mother. They identify their own body with the body of the mother. Likewise when they attack their children, they express violence towards a [[narcissistic]] extension of themselves" (Motz, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The major forms it can manifest itself are &lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 5-8&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[self-harm]]
* [[eating disorders]]
* physical and sexual abuse of children
* [[infanticide]]
* [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]]
* physical or sexual assault of others, including battered women who kill
 
Welldon argues that it can be seen as a form of sexualised aggression, and challenges the Freudian view that violence is a uniquely male phallic expression.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reproductive functions and organs are used by both sexes to express perversion. Perverse men use their penises to attack and show hatred towards symbolic sources of humiliation..... If perversion in the man is focused through his penis, in the woman it will similarly expressed through her reproductive organs and the maternal representations of motherhood

(Welldon 1991) &lt;ref name="Welldon" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Anna Motz]], in her book ''The psychology of female violence'' suggests that the expression of this anger on the body or that of another is a communicative act, clearly sending a message of internal pain or of psychosis (Motz, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; She calls the message "the language of the body", and that the symbolic use of violence against the body can be likened to psychosomatic illness.

===Violence against the self===

Violence against the self can take several forms, including deprivation and starvation as is the case in [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia]], [[self-injury]] or suicide attempts, or other forms of self-harm.

===Violence against children===

Violence against children often goes unreported, and is largely hidden from view. It can take the form of direct physical or sexual assault, [[Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy]], or [[infanticide]]. Often the capacity of women to commit violence against children is denied, in the refusal to 'think the unthinkable'.&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence against adults===
Violence against others can take many forms, from domestic assault, physical assault, and when it escalates in the form of [[homicide]] and/or [[infanticide]].

In the [[systems theory|theory of complex systems]], a '''function tree''' is a [[diagram]] showing the dependencies between the functions of a [[system]]. It breaks a [[problem]] (or its solution) down into simpler parts.

When used in [[computer programming]], a function tree visualizes which [[Function (computer science)|function]] calls another.

The form that used to register a site with the [[Usenet]] [[map]]ping project, before [[Internet]] connectivity became commonplace for Usenet sites, included a field for [[longitude]] and [[latitude]], preferably to [[arcsecond|seconds-of-arc]] accuracy.  This was actually used for generating geographically-correct maps of [[Usenet]] links on a plotter; however, it became traditional to refer to this as one's [[ICBM]] address or missile address, and some people include it in their [[signature block|sig block]] with that name (but a real missile address would include target [[elevation#Geography|elevation]]).

A typical tag might read "ICBM Address: 36.8274040 N, 108.0204086 W".

== Modern use ==
Today, using the ICBM method of coordinates is one method of [[geotagging]] webpages or other online material.  Some projects parse ICBM address included in [[webpage]]s via [[meta tags]], which can then be used to map out sites added to its [[database]].

Web page uses of &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html4strict" enclose="none"&gt;&lt;meta name="ICBM" content="12.345, 67.890"&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions|title=MetaExtensions|website=WHATWG Wiki|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; specify the same location as a [[Geo URI|geo:12.345,67.890]] URI.

{{Other uses|Incontinence (disambiguation)}}
'''Incontinence''' ("a want of continence or self-restraint") is often used by philosophers to translate the Greek term [[Akrasia]] (ἀκρασία). Used to refer to a lacking in moderation or self-control, especially related to sexual desire,&lt;ref&gt;dictionary.com – [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/incontinence incontinence]&lt;/ref&gt; incontinence may also be called '''wantonness'''.

==Aristotle==
[[Aristotle]] devoted book VII of the [[Nicomachean Ethics]] to the discussion of continence and incontinence, having previously linked the latter both to [[Spendthrift|prodigality]] in its effects, and to those dominated by irrational feeling in its failure to obey knowledge of the good:&lt;ref&gt;J. A. K. Thompson trans, ''The Ethics of Aristotle'' (1976) pp. 142, 66, and 89&lt;/ref&gt; a case of knowing [[virtue]], but not having habituated it to control [[Passion (emotion)|passion]]. 

Aristotle considered one could be incontinent with respect to money or temper or glory, but that its core relation was to bodily enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 235-9&lt;/ref&gt; Its causes could be weakness of will, or an impetuous refusal to think.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he did not consider it a vice, because it is not so much a product of moral choice, but instead, a failure to act on one's better knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 244-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==

For Augustine, incontinence was not so much a problem of knowledge (knowing but not acting) but of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]]: he considered it a matter of everyday experience that men incontinently choose lesser over greater goods.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Mitcham, ''Thinking Through Technology'' (1994) p. 263-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the structural division of [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's ''Inferno'']], incontinence is the sin punished in the second through fifth circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durling|first1=Robert M.|last2=Martinez|first2=Ronald L.|page=178|title=Inferno|series=The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri|volume=1|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1996|isbn=9780195087444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutual incontinence of lust was for Dante the lightest of the deadly sins,&lt;ref&gt;Dante, p. 101-2&lt;/ref&gt; even if its lack of self-control would open the road to deeper layers of Hell.

Akrasia appeared later as a character in Spenser's [[The Faerie Queene]], representing the incontinence of lust, followed in the next canto by a study of that of anger;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Spenser]], ''The Fairie Queen'' (1978) p. lxiv&lt;/ref&gt; and as late as [[Jane Austen]] the [[sensibility]] of such figures as [[Marianne Dashwood]] would be treated as a form of (spiritual) incontinence.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Harman, ''Jane's Fame'' (2007) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

With the triumph of [[Romanticism]], however, the incontinent choice of feeling over reason became increasingly valorised in Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Mitcham, p. 265–56&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Blake|Blake]] wrote that "those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], there was a rise of what [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] would describe as "an ''abandon'' (ακρατεια)...a state of mind in which [[antinomianism]] is accepted – consciously or unconsciously, in theory or in practice – as a substitute for creativeness".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold J. Toynbee, ''[[A Study of History]]'' (1939) v5 p. 377 and p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

A peak of such acrasia was perhaps reached in the 1960s cult of letting it all hang out – of breakdown, acting out and emotional self-indulgence and drama.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Diski, ''The Sixties'' (2009) p. 120-1&lt;/ref&gt; Partly in reaction, the proponents of [[emotional intelligence]] would look back to Aristotle in the search for impulse control and [[Gratification|delayed gratification]]&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) pp. 80–83 and p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; – to his dictum that "a person is called continent or incontinent according as his reason is or is not in control".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeremy Lent''' (born 1960) is an author whose writings investigate the patterns of thought that have led civilization to its current crisis of sustainability. He is the founder of the non-profit Liology Institute, which is dedicated to a worldview that could enable humanity to thrive sustainably. He is the author of ''The Patterning Instinct'' and ''Requiem of the Human Soul''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Earlier in his career, Lent was the founder, chairman and CEO of the internet company [[NextCard]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=899887|title=NEXTCARD INC (Form: S-1/A, Received: 04/30/1999 09:49:46)|website=www.nasdaq.com|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Lent was born and raised in [[London]]. He graduated from the [[University College School]] and earned an undergraduate degree in [[English literature|English Literature]] at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeremylent.com/|title=Website of Jeremy Lent – Author of The Patterning Instinct|website=Jeremy Lent  Author and Integrator|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lent left the UK to live in the United States. In 1986, he earned an [[MBA]] from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is married and currently lives in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

In addition to his writing, Lent is a practitioner of meditation, [[Qigong]], and [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]]. He is a Level II certified teacher of Radiant Heart Qigong.

== Career ==
Lent joined Strategic Planning Associates, a strategy consulting company based in Washington, D.C. In 1989, he joined First Deposit Corporation (later renamed [[Providian]]), a direct mail [[credit card]] company in San Francisco. Lent was named [[Chief financial officer|Chief Financial Officer]] of Providian in 1991 and left the company in 1994.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1996, Lent founded [[NextCard]], an internet [[financial services]] company. NextCard was the first company to enable consumers to apply for a credit card over the internet and be approved in real time and the first company to offer consumers the ability to design their own card by uploading a personalized image during the application process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As chairman and CEO, Lent took NextCard public in 1999 and led a secondary offering in 2000. However, due to his first wife’s illness, Lent stepped down as CEO later in 2000, to care for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/1012883/1/nextcard-mixes-good-news-quicker-profitability-with-bad-ceos-departure.html|title=NextCard Mixes Good News, Quicker Profitability, With Bad, CEO's Departure|last=Eavis|first=Peter|date=2000-07-24|work=TheStreet|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Lent’s departure, NextCard suffered serious setbacks. It was announced in late 2001, that the company was undercapitalized, and it was taken over by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) in 2002.  Along with the other board members, Lent was involved for several years in shareholder lawsuits and investigations by the FDIC and [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). These were eventually settled, and in 2005 the SEC dismissed fraud charges that it had levied against Lent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19903.htm|title=Jeremy R.

== Writing ==

=== ''The Patterning Instinct'' ===
''The Patterning Instinct: A Cultural History of Humanity’s Search for Meaning'' ([[Prometheus Books]], May 2017) is a cognitive history of humanity, tracing how different cultures patterned meaning into the universe and how that has affected history. The result of ten years of research, the book offers a thesis that “culture shapes values and those values shape history.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This approach is in contrast to the predominant [[Geographic determinism|geographic determinist]] approach to history, exemplified by historians such as [[Jared Diamond]], [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]] and [[Kenneth Pomeranz]]. Lent argues that “The cognitive frames through which different cultures perceive reality have had a profound effect on their historical direction. The worldview of a given civilization—the implicit beliefs and values that create a pattern of meaning in people’s lives—has, in my opinion, been a significant driver of the historical path each civilization has taken.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lent|first=Jeremy|date=|title=Patterning Instinct|url=|journal=Origins: The Bulletin of the International Big History Association|volume=VI|pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book conducts what Lent calls an “archaeological exploration of the mind,” using findings from [[cognitive science]] and [[systems theory]] to reveal the implicit layers of values that form cultural norms. In a departure from the mainstream science-religion debate, ''The Patterning Instinct'' shows how medieval Christian rationalism acted as an incubator for scientific thought, which in turn, shaped the modern vision of the “conquest of nature.” Evaluating the sustainability crisis, Lent argues that it is culturally driven: a product of particular patterns that could be reshaped.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edelweiss.abovethetreeline.com/ProductDetailPage.aspx?sequence=18&amp;group=catalog&amp;mailingID=0&amp;mailingGroupID=0&amp;catalogID=4016922&amp;org=&amp;sku=1633882934|title=The Patterning Instinct|website=edelweiss.abovethetreeline.com|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book concludes by exploring scenarios for humanity’s future, foreseeing a coming struggle between two contrasting views: one driving to a technological world of artificially enhanced humans, the other enabling a sustainable future arising from intrinsic connectedness among people and to the natural world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''The Patterning Instinct'' contains a foreword by [[Fritjof Capra]]. Prior to publication, the book received favorable endorsements from notables such as [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich,]] [[Thom Hartmann]], Rick Hanson, [[J. R. McNeill]], and [[Jonathon Porritt]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Guardian journalist, George Monbiot, has called it "the most profound and far-reaching book I have ever read."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2018/01/31/stepping-back-from-the-brink/|title=Stepping Back from the Brink|work=George Monbiot|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received a Silver Award from [http://nautilusbookawards.com/2017-silver-winners/ Nautilus Book Awards] in April, 2018 in the Social Sciences &amp; Education category.

=== ''Requiem of the Human Soul'' ===
Beginning around 2005, Lent began an inquiry into the various constructions of meaning formed by cultures around the world and throughout history. The first expression of this investigation was his science fiction novel, ''Requiem of the Human Soul'' (Libros Libertad, 2009)..

The novel is set in the late 22nd century when most people are genetically enhanced. The minority that remains genetically unadulterated, known as Primals, consists mostly of the impoverished global underclass. The UN is holding a hearing in New York to consider whether to make the Primals extinct. The novel is written from the viewpoint of a Primal, Eusebio, who has been picked to represent his race in a last-ditch legal effort to save the Primals from extinction.

The novel raises questions about spirituality, history and global politics: Can the human race enhance itself to a higher plane? At what cost and benefit? If some “essence” of humanity was lost as a result, would that be so bad, given our sordid and shameful history? On the other hand, is there something special—a human soul—worth keeping at any price? Ultimately, the novel invites the reader to grapple with a fundamental question: what does it mean to be human?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Requiem of the Human Soul|last=Lent|first=Jeremy|publisher=Libros Libertad|year=2009|isbn=|location=Vancouver|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liology Institute ==
Lent founded the nonprofit Liology Institute in 2012, with the aim of fostering a worldview that could enable humanity to thrive sustainably. The institute, according to its website, “is dedicated to fostering a worldview in which the human discovery and experience of meaning in our lives is compatible with the findings of scientific investigation, offering a deeply integrated and coherent understanding of humanity’s place in our cosmos which could enable us to thrive on our planet harmoniously and sustainably.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liology.org/|title=The Liology Institute|website=The Liology Institute|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lent coined the term "liology" from the Chinese word ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]],'' meaning organizing principles of the universe, and “ology” of Greek etymology meaning “the study of.” The institute is intended to integrate traditional East Asian practices with the findings of modern systems science.

Its stated objectives are to:
* Stimulate and encourage a deep integration of scientific rigor with spiritual meaning.
* Distill East Asian spiritual traditions and integrate them with findings in systems biology, complexity science and neuroscience.
* Replace the mind/body duality of conventional Western thought with a concept that value is intrinsic to our experience.
* Join the worldwide movement towards achieving a sustainable way of living.
* Adopt an interdisciplinary approach to understanding humanity's history, current condition and trajectory.
* Cultivate skills that promote integration within a person and harmonization between humanity and the natural world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
In 2014, the institute began an annual series of workshops, exploring how the values and insights of Liology apply to people’s everyday lives.

== Great Transformation ==
Lent asserts that humanity is entering a period of transformation, of a scale that has occurred twice before in history: the [[First agricultural revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] twelve thousand years ago, and the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific]] and [[Industrial Revolution]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s several hundred years ago. The trajectories he consider include a [[collapse of civilization]], a [[Posthumanism|posthuman]] techno society and sustainable human flourishing (a "Great Transformation").

Lent claims that, to secure the latter humanity needs a new suite of values based on a sense of intrinsic connectedness. These values emphasize:
* Quality of life, rather than material possessions
* Political, social, and economic choices based on shared humanity
* Environmentally sustainable societies.&lt;ref&gt;“The Great Transformation, Or How We (Just) Avoided a Climate Catastrophe: A historian in 2050 looks back at the first half of the century.” Presented at the UC Santa Barbara virtual conference: ''The World In 2050: Creating/Imagining Just Climate Futures.''

''Ken'' means "seeing," ''shō'' means [[Buddha-nature|"nature, essence"]].{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=287}} It is usually translated as "seeing one's (true) nature," that is, the [[Buddha-nature]].

Kenshō is an ''initial'' insight or awakening, not full [[Buddhahood]].{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=226}} It is to be followed by further training to deepen this insight, and learn to express it in daily life.{{sfn|Sekida (translator)|1996}}{{sfn|Yen|1996|p=54}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}

The term kenshō is often used interchangeably with [[satori]], which is derived from the verb [[satoru]],{{sfn|Suzuki|1994-A|p=88}} and means "comprehension; understanding".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://jisho.org/words?jap=&amp;eng=satori&amp;dict=edict Denshi Jisho – Online Japanese dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Fischer-Schreiber, ''kenshō'' and ''[[satori]]'' are nearly synonymous, with a customary distinction of using ''kenshō'' for an initial enlightenment experience that still requires deepening, and ''satori'' for the [[Buddhahood]] enlightenment of a Buddha or Zen patriarch.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|1991|p=115}} Hakuin uses the word "satori" for initial insight, synonymous with kensho.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}}}{{refn|group=note|The Japanese Zen-tradition has a rich vocabulaire of terms related to "enlightenment": awakenening (''kaku''), true awakening (''shōgaku''), perfect awakening (''engaku''), insight (''sei''), attaining the Way (''jōdō''), becoming Buddha (''jōbutsu''), opening the eye (''kaigen''), liberation (''gedatsu''), aythetication (''shō''), the great death (''daishi''), self-enlightenment without a teacher (''mushi dokugo''), great satori with full penetration (''taigo tettei''), and peerless perfect enlightenment (''anokutara sanmyaku sanbodai'').{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=90}} The list is not exhausted with these terms.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=90}} Another term for deep awakening is [[Daigo (Zen)|daigo]].}}

==Terminology==
The Chinese Buddhist term ''jianxing'' ({{zh|s=见性|t=見性|p=jiànxìng |w=chien-hsing}}) [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]]:
* ''jian'' [[wikt:見|見]] "see, observe, meet with, perceive";
* ''xing'' [[wikt:性|性]] "(inborn) nature, character, personality, disposition, property, quality,gender".

===History===
Buddhist monks who produced [[Chinese Buddhism#Early translation methods|Sanskrit-Chinese translations]] of sutras faced many linguistic difficulties:
* They chose Chinese ''jian'' 見 to translate [[Sanskrit]] ''dṛś'' [[wikt:दृश्|दृश्]] "see, look", and the central Buddhist idea of ''[[View (Buddhism)|dṛṣṭi]]'' [[wikt:दृष्टि|दृष्टि]] "view, seeing (also with the mind's eye), wisdom, false view".
* Translators used ''xing'' 性 or ''zixing'' 自性 "self-nature" for Sanskrit ''[[svabhava|svabhāva]]'' [[wikt:स्वभाव|स्वभाव]] "intrinsic nature, essential nature".
Thus, ''jianxing'' was the translation for ''dṛṣṭi-svabhāva'', "view one's essential nature".

The (c. 8th century) Chinese ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' (2, [[Wisdom in Buddhism|Prajñā]] "wisdom, understanding") first records ''jianxing''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hanyu Da Cidian]] 汉语大词典, vol. 10, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronunciations===
The [[Standard Chinese]] pronunciation ''jianxing'' historically derives from (c. 7th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] ''kien&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;sjäŋ&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]] of this term exist:
* ''kenshō''  見性 or ケンショウ (''[[Kanji#On'yomi (Chinese reading)|on'yomi]]'') in [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]]
* {{Korean|hangul=견성|rr=gyeonseong}} in [[Sino-Korean vocabulary]]
* ''kiến tính'' in [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]].{{sfn|Muller|year unknown}}

==Meanings of kenshō==
{{See also|Bodhi|Wisdom in Buddhism{{!}}Prajna|Buddha-nature|Sunyata|Suchness|Dharmakaya|Alayavijnana}}

Translating ''kenshō'' into English is semantically complex.

===Encyclopedic and dictionary definitions===
Some encyclopedia and dictionary definitions are:
* Soothill (1934): "To behold the Buddha-nature within oneself, a common saying of the Chan (Zen) or Intuitive School."{{sfn|Soothill|1934|p=244}}
* Fischer-Schreiber (1991): Lit. "seeing nature"; Zen expression for the experience of awakening (enlightenment). Since the meaning is "seeing one's own true nature," ''kenshō'' is usually translated "self-realization." Like all words that try to reduce the conceptually ungraspable experience of enlightenment to a concept, this one is also not entirely accurate and is even misleading, since the experience contains no duality of "seer" and "seen" because there is no "nature of self' as an object that is seen by a subject separate from it.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|1991|p=115}}
* Baroni (2002): "Seeing one's nature," that is, realizing one's own original Buddha Nature. In the Rinzai school, it most often refers more specifically to one's initial enlightenment attained through [[kōan]] practice.{{sfn|Baroni|2002|p=188}}
* Muller (year unknown): To see one's own originally enlightened mind. To behold the Buddha-nature within oneself, a common saying of the Chan school, as seen for example, in the phrase 'seeing one's nature, becoming Buddha'  見性成佛.{{sfn|Muller|year unknown}}

===Definitions by Buddhist scholars===
Buddhist scholars have defined ''kenshō'' as:
* D.T. Suzuki: "Looking into one's nature or the opening of satori";{{sfn|Suzuki|1994-B|p=259}} "This acquiring of a new point of view in our dealings with life and the world is popularly called by Japanese Zen students 'satori' (''wu'' in Chinese). It is really another name for Enlightenment (''[[Enlightenment in Buddhism#Buddha's awakening|Annuttara-samyak-sambodhi]]'')".{{sfn|Suzuki-1994-B|p=229}}{{refn|group=note|D.T. Suzuki has been criticized for his highly idealized and inaccurate picture of Japanese Zen.{{sfn|MacRae|2003}} [[Enlightenment in Buddhism#Buddha's awakening|Annuttara-samyak-sambodhi]] is the highest state of realization and awakening. Satori, or kensho, is a first glimpse into "nature", to be followed by further training.}}
* Dumoulin (1988/2005): "Enlightenment is described here as an insight into the identity of one's own nature with all of reality in an eternal now, as a vision that removes all distinctions. This enlightenment is the center and the goal of the Zen way. Hakuin prefers the term "seeing into one's nature", which for him means ultimate reality. The Buddha nature and the [[Dharmakaya|cosmic Buddha body]], wisdom (''prajna''), and emptiness (''sunyata''), [[Original face|the original countenance one had before one was born]], and other expressions from the rich palette of Mahayana terms were all familiar to him from his continued study of the sutras and [[Zen#Zen literature|Zen literature]]."{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=380}}
* Peter Harvey (1990): "It is a blissful realization where a person's inner nature, the [[Eight Consciousnesses#Ālayavijñāna|originally pure mind]], is directly known as an illuminating [[Sunyata|emptiness]], a [[Tathatā/Dharmatā|thusness]] which is dynamic and [[Five Ranks|immanent in the world]]."{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=275-276}}
* G. Victor Sogen Hori (2000): "The term consists of two characters: ''ken'', which means "see" or "seeing", and ''sho'', which means "nature", "character", "quality." To "see one's nature" is the usual translation for ''kensho''".{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=287}}

===Definitions by Buddhist teachers and practitioners===
Buddhist teachers and practitioners have defined ''kenshō'' as:
* [[Jiyu-Kennett]]: "To see into one's own nature. The experience of enlightenment, satori."{{sfn|Jiyu-Kennett|2005b|p=263}}
* Myodo Ni Satomi, a student of [[Hakuun Yasutani]] (1993): "Seeing the-self, that is, the true self or Buddha nature."{{sfn|Satomi|1993|p=203}}

===Further notions===
The term ''kenshō'' refers to the realization of non-duality of subject and object in general,{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}} but the term ''kenshō'' may also be applied in other contexts:{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=290}} "How do you ''kenshō'' this?"{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}}

''Kenshō'' is not a single experience, but refers to a whole series of realizations from a beginner's shallow glimpse of the nature of mind, up to a vision of emptiness equivalent to the [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)#The first bhūmi, the Very Joyous|'Path of Seeing']] or to Buddhahood itself. In all of these, the same 'thing' is known, but in different degrees of clarity and profundity.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=275-276}}{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=31}}

"Kenshō" is commonly translated as [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], a word that is also used to translate [[bodhi]], [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]], [[satori]] and [[buddhahood]]. Western discourse tends to use these terms interchangeably, but there is a distinction between a first insight, and the further development toward Buddhahood.

==Insight versus experience==
{{See also|Buddhist modernism|Transcendentalism|Perennial philosophy}}

Kensho is insight, an understanding of reality as-it-is.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=82}}{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=275-276}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=380}}{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}} Contemporary understanding also describes kensho as an ''experience'', as in "enlightenment experience"; the term "enlightenment experience" is itself a [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]: "Kensho (enlightenment) is an enlightenment (kensho)-experience".

The notion of "experience" fits in a popular set of dichotomies: pure (unmediated) versus mediated, noncognitive versus cognitive, experiential versus intellectual, intuitive versus intellectual, nonrational versus rational, nondiscursive versus discursive, nonpropositional versus propositional.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}

The notion of ''pure experience'' (''junsui kuiken'') to interpret and understand kensho was introduced by [[Nishida Kitaro]] in his [[An Inquiry into the Good]] (1911), under influence of "his somewhat idiosyncratic reading of western philosophy",{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=248}} especially [[William James]], who wrote [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]].{{refn|group=note|Victor Sogen Hori notes that Nishida Kitaro, although using a western terminology, tried to express basic Mahayana Teachings: "He borrowed, for example, the term, junsui keiken, "pure experience", from William James, but then went on to say that, while for James the individual preceded pure experience, for him, pure experience preceded the individual. That reversal makes Nishida’s notion of pure experience resemble less the psychology of William James and more the Mahayana notion of sunyata.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}}} [[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768-1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for western interpretations and expectations regarding kensho, similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: "It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimization of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protestant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion."{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}} See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196-197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}} [[D.T. Suzuki]], who introduced Nishida Kitaro to western philosophy, took over this notion of ''pure experience'', describing it as the essence of all religions,{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=248}} but best represented in the [[Nihonjinron|superior Japanese culture and religion]].{{sfn|Sharf|1993}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}}

The influence of western psychology and philosophy on Japanese Buddhism was due to the persecution of Buddhism at the beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the subsequent efforts to construct a [[Buddhist modernism|New Buddhism]] (''shin bukkyo''), adapted to the modern times.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=246-248}}{{sfn|Victoria|2006}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} It was this New Buddhism which has shaped [[Zen#Zen Narratives|the understanding of Zen in the west]],{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}} especially through the writings of D.T. Suzuki{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=247-248}}{{sfn|Borup|Year unknown}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and the [[Sanbo Kyodan]], an exponent of the Meiji-era opening of Zen-training for lay-followers.{{sfn|Sharf|1995c}}

The notion of "experience" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=12}} Robert Sharf points out that "experience" is a typical western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: "[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west [...] While some adepts may indeed experience "altered states" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference pont for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the "path".{{sfn|Sharf|1995c|p=1}}}} The notion of "experience" introduces a false notion of duality between "experiencer" and "experienced", where-as the essence of kensho is the realisation of the "non-duality" of observer and observed.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=82}} "Pure experience" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80-82}} The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what "experience" someone has, which means that this "experience" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by "cleaning the doors of perception"{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thru' narrow chinks of his cavern."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2653 Quote DB]&lt;/ref&gt;}}, would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=284}}
The notion of "experience" also over-emphasises kensho, as if it were the single goal of Zen-training, where-as the Zen-tradition clearly states that "the stink of Zen"{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=143}} has to be removed and the "experience" of kensho has to be integrated into daily life.{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}} In the Rinzai-school this post-satori training includes the study and mastering of great amounts of classical Chinese poetry, which is far from "universal" and culture-transcending. On the contrary, it demands an education in culture-specific language and behaviour, which is measured by specific and strict cultural norms.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=50-53}} Emphasising "experience" "reduces the sophisticated dialectic of Ch'an/Zen doctrine and praxis to a mere "means" or set of techniques intended to inculcate such experiences".{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=266}}

==Kenshō "experiences"==

===Classical accounts===
The classical Zen-texts, such as the ''Kao-seng-chuan'' (Biographies of Eminent Monks) and the transmission lists, called "Transmission of the Lamp"{{refn|group=note|A literary device to establish a lineage. Both [[Tiantai|T'ien Tai]] and Chán took over this literary device, to lend authority to those developing traditions, and guarantee its authenticity.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=181}}{{sfn|McRae|p=2-9}}  Notable examples are the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' (952) and the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp|Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp]]'' (published 1004). McRae considers Dumoulin's ''A History of Zen'' to be a modern example of this genre, disguished as scientific history;{{sfn|McRae|2005}}}} the ''yü-lü'' genre{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=192}} (the recorded sayings of the masters, such as the [[Linji Yixuan#Linji yü lü|Linji yü lü]]); and the various koan-collections,{{refn|group=note|The two best known koan-collections (in the west) are the "Gateless Gate" and the "Blue Cliff Record". ''[[The Gateless Gate]]'' (Chinese: 無門關 Wumenguan; Japanese: Mumonkan) is a collection of 48 kōans and commentaries published in 1228 by Chinese monk [[Wumen]] (無門) (1183–1260). The title may be more accurately rendered as ''Gateless Barrier'' or ''Gateless Checkpoint''. The ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'' (Chinese: 碧巖錄 Bìyán Lù; Japanese: Hekiganroku) is a collection of 100 kōans compiled in 1125 by [[Yuanwu Keqin]] (圜悟克勤 1063–1135).}} contain accounts of "enlightenment experiences". These accounts are not verbatim recordings of such "experiences", but well-edited texts, written down decades or even decennia after the supposed sayings and meetings.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown}}

''The [[Denkōroku]]'', "The Record of the Transmission of the Light", written by [[Keizan Jōkin]] 瑩山紹瑾 (1268–1325), is an example of the "Transmission of the Lamp" genre. It contains literary accounts of the patriarchs of the Soto-lineage, from [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] to [[Koun Ejō]], in which kensho plays a central role. They are not to be taken as literal accounts of awakening, but as stories underpinning the legitimacy of the [[Sōtō|Dogen-shu]], which in its early history had seen a fierce internal conflict over the correct lineage during the [[Sandai sōron]].{{sfn|Cook|2003|p=xi-xii}}{{sfn|Faure|2000}}{{refn|group=note|Cook: "It is probably safe to say that few if any reputable modern scholars, and probably not many even within the Soto priesthood itself, believe that many of the central events and characters in the ''Denkoroku'' are based on historical fact [...] The origins and early developments of Chinese Zen are just now becoming clearer, and the gradually emerging picture is very different from the traditional Zen history found in such works as Keizan's record".{{sfn|Cook|2003|p=15}}}}

The Denkoroku gives the following account of Dogen's awakening:
{{quote|Once, during late-night zazen, [[Rujing]] told the monks, "Studying Zen is the dropping off of body and mind." Hearing this, the master was suddenly greatly awakened. He went at once to the Abbott's room and burned incense. Rujing asked him, "Why are you burning incense?" The master answered, "Body and mind have dropped off." Rujing said, "Body and mind have dropped off, the dropped-off body and mind." The master said, "This is a temporarily ability; you must not approve me without reason." Rujing replied, "I am not approving you without reason." The master asked, "Why are you not approving me without reason?" Rujing said, "You dropped off body and mind." The master bowed. Rujing said, "You have dropped off dropping off."{{sfn|Cook|2003|p=255}}}}

===Contemporary accounts===
Although the Zen tradition is reluctant to speak openly about the 'experience' of kensho,{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=17}} personal accounts can be found in Zen-texts.

[[Hakuin]] gives this description of his first kensho, when he was 21:{{sfn|Waddell|2004|p=xxii}}
{{quote|At around midnight on the seventh and final night of my practice, the boom of a bell from a distant temple reached my ears: suddenly, my body and mind dropped completely away. I rose clear of even the finest dust. Overwhelmed with joy, I hollered out at the tops of my lungs, "Old Yen-t'ou is alive and well! [...] After that, however, I became extremely proud and arrogant".{{sfn|Hakuin|2010|p=23}}}}

Hakuin's ''kensho'' was not approved by Shoju Rojin, who subjected Hakuin to more koan-training. This resulted in a second kensho, where-after Hakuin left Shoju Rojin. It was only when he was 41 that he attained "his final great enlightenment":{{sfn|Waddell|2004|p=xxii}}
{{quote|[W]hen Shoju had asked his reason for becoming a monk, his reply – that he had done it because he was afraid of falling into hell – had brought the scornful retort: "You're a self-centered rascal, aren't you!" Not until eighteen years later, upon attainment of his final great enlightenment at the age of forty-one, would Hakuin fully grasp the significance of Shoju's reproach and with it the true meaning of "post-satori" practice. Years later, when Hakuin asked his student Torei the same question, Torei's answer – "To work for the salvation of my fellow beings" – brought a laugh from Hakuin. "A much better reason than mine", he said.{{sfn|Waddell|2004|p=xxii}}}}

Keido Fukushima, a 20th-century Rinzai abbott, gives the following description:
{{quote|At Nanzenji there is a small hill. I used to walk near there, look at it, and often smile at the high school students who walked by there as well. One day as I walked by, I looked at the hill and it was truly amazing. i was totally lost as if there was no 'me'. I stood gazing at the hill. Some students walked by and one of them said something like 'look at that crazy monk'. Finally I came out of it. Life was never the same for me. I was free.{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=17}}{{refn|group=note|Harris: "After this experience Gensho still had two more years of ''koan'' study".{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=17}}}}}}

Other accounts can be found throughout the Zen-literature.{{refn|group=note|Kapleau gives ten different accounts of contemporary practitioners, including his own kensho under the initials "KP".{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}} Sekida gives an elaborate account of his own kenshos,{{sfn|Sekiad|1985|p=207-222}} and gives various accounts of others.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|194-206}} Satomi gives an account of becoming one with the mu-koan, the classical aimed kensho of the Sanbo Kyodan.{{sfn|Satomi|1993|p=106}} Maura O'Halloran also gives an account of herself becoming mu.{{sfn|O'Halloran|2007|p=78}}}}

===Spontaneous kenshō===
Kenshō may be attained without the aid of a teacher. For example, Richard Clarke (1933), who studied with [[Philip Kapleau]], states that he had a spontaneous kensho when he was 13.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.payer.de/neobuddhismus/neobud040421.htm Japanischer Buddhismus in Amerika. Chronik Ab 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis Genpo Merzel]] states he had what he described as an "awakening experience" in 1971:&lt;ref group=web name=Genpo&gt;[http://www.kripalu.org/article/313/ Big Mind: An Interview with Genpo Roshi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701071517/http://kripalu.org/article/313/ |date=2014-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It was in February of that year, and I was 26 years old. My second serious relationship was ending, and I was feeling very confined and conflicted. I needed to get some space, so I went out to the Mojave desert for a three-day camping weekend with two friends. On the Friday, I hiked up a mountain alone. I knew nothing about meditation or spiritual practice. I was just sitting there, thinking about my life and the things going on. I felt I had gotten pretty screwed up for such a young age.&lt;br/&gt;
I could see my VW camper, my home for the weekend, parked a few miles away, . But at the same time, I was aware that my home was back in Long Beach, California. And a natural koan came to me: Where is home? All of a sudden, I had a kind of breakthrough. I felt myself fall away, and I became one with the cosmos, one with the universe, one with all things. I knew in that moment that wherever I am, that is home; home is everywhere. I also knew who I was, beyond description, but let’s call it Big Mind.&lt;br/&gt;
That experience completely changed my life.&lt;ref group=web name=Genpo /&gt;}}

More descriptions of "spontaneous kensho" can be found throughout the Zen-literature,{{refn|group=note|Sekida gives the example of a woman, who's "strong internal pressure (''gidan'') never stopped knocking from within at the door of her mind, demanding to be resolved [...] One day, when she was about to take a bath, a certain change occurred in her. Although this was later confirmed as kensho by a teacher, she had no idea what it was.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=138-139}} Philip Kapleau describes a man who had kensho, which was explained as a "conversion experience" by psychiatrists.{{sfn|Kapleau|1980|p=52}} Flora Courtois gives an extensive account of her spontaneous kensho,{{sfn|Maezumi|2007|p=111-136}} on which Yasutani comments.{{sfn|Maezumi|2007|p=137-140}}}} while a classic example may be [[Ramana Maharshi#Awakening|Ramana Maharshi]]'s awakening.

==Training towards kenshō==
{{See also|Zen#Zen practice|l1=Zen practice}}

According to Harris, working towards kensho is usually a lengthy process stretched out over years or even decades.{{sfn|Harris|2004}} Contrary to this, Victor Hori notes that with koan-study kensho may appear within six months.
{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=29}}{{refn|group=note|Houn Jiyu-Kennett, a western [[Zen ranks and hierarchy|sei-kyoshi]]{{sfn|Bluck|2006|p=66}} or soto-priest, also is reported to have attained kensho after six months of tarining in a Soto-monastery.{{sfn|Bluck|2006|p=65}}}}

[[Sōtō]] tends towards a gradual approach, preferring to let the experiences happen on their own. [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] tends toward the use of [[Koan]]s as a technique to unroot the habitual workings of the mind.{{sfn|Kasulis|2003}}

During intensive zazen various [[hallucination]]s and psychological disturbances may arise. These are referred to as [[makyo]]. Distinguishing these delusions from actual kensho is the primary function of the teacher, as the student may be erroneously convinced they have realized kensho.

===Rinzai===
In the [[Rinzai school]], kensho is seen as indispensable:
{{quote|At some point in time we pass from imprisonment in ignorance and delusion to a true vision of Zen realization: "Our enlightenment is timeless, yet our realization of it occurs in time." According to this belief experiencing a moment of awakening in this life is of central importance.{{sfn|Lachs|2012|p=4}}}}

In the Rinzai-training, the student is expected to pour oneself totally into both koan-study and daily activities 'to become one' with it.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=290}} Kenshō is used to describe the first breakthrough in [[kōan]] study.{{sfn|Baroni|2002|p=188}}{{refn|group=note|See {{sfn|Satomi|1993|p=106}} for a description of 'becoming one with'.}}

===Sōtō===
In the [[Sōtō]] school there are two kinds of awakening.{{sfn|Warner|2009|p=28}} One is the practice of [[shikantaza]], which is the "actual enlightened activity of the Buddha".{{sfn|Warner|2009|p=28}} The other is the accumulation of little bits of understanding, which come together, giving way to a deeper intuitive knowledge.{{sfn|Warner|2009|p=28-29}}

The "[[Genjōkōan|genjo-koan]]", or the "koan of everyday life" which "appears naturally in daily life",{{sfn|Dogen|year unknown}} is emphasized. Students are not encouraged to actively seek out kenshō experiences. In Sōtō practice kenshōs "are allowed to occur naturally, as a by-product of practice. Meditative training is seen as the unfolding of one great ''kenshō'':{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=275-276}}
{{quote|According to the tradition of Soto Zen, although working on a koan is one way of attaining kensho, the best way is zazen. Indeed, [[Dogen]], the founder of Soto Zen, expounded that zazen itself is enlightenment, and as long as the adept maintains a pure state of non-thinking in Zen, he is a Buddha.{{sfn|Kit|2002|p=145}}}}

===Sanbō Kyōdan===
Kenshō also plays a central in the [[Sanbō Kyōdan]], a Japanese Zen organisation which played a decisive role in the transmission of Zen to the [[Zen in the United States|United States]].{{sfn|Sharf|1995c}} Yasutani, the founder of the Sanbo Kyodan, was disappointed about the lack of interest in kensho in the Soto school. Yasutani's emphasis on koan training and the importance of kensho was transmitted to his American students:{{sfn|Sharf|1995c}}
{{quote|He was especially vocal concerning the point of kenshō, seeing one's true nature. He spoke more openly about it then anyone of his times, going so far as to have a public acknowledgement of those who had experienced kensho in a post-sesshin ceremony of bowing in gratitude to the three treasures.{{sfn|Jaffe|1979}}}}

It is also reflected in the inclusion of a relative great amount of kensho stories in "The Three Pillars of Zen", written by [[Philip Kapleau]], a student of Yasutani.{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}

==Training after kenshō==
{{See also|Bodhicitta|Karuṇā|Ten Bulls|Sahaja}}

Zen Buddhist training does not end with kenshō. Practice is to be continued to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life.{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}{{sfn|Maezumi|2007|p=54, 140}} According to the contemporary Chan Master [[Sheng Yen]]:
{{quote|Ch'an expressions refer to enlightenment as "seeing your self-nature". But even this is not enough. After seeing your self-nature, you need to deepen your experience even further and bring it into maturation. You should have enlightenment experience again and again and support them with continuous practice. Even though Ch'an says that at the time of enlightenment, your outlook is the same as of the Buddha, you are not yet a [[Buddhahood|full Buddha]].{{sfn|Yen|1996|p=54}}}}

And the contemporary western Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett:
{{quote|One can easily get the impression that realization, kenshō, an experience of enlightenment, or however you wish to phrase it, is the end of Zen training. It is not. It is, rather, a new beginning, an entrance into a more mature phase of Buddhist training. To take it as an ending, and to "dine out" on such an experience without doing the training that will deepen and extend it, is one of the greatest tragedies of which I know. There must be continuous development, otherwise you will be as a wooden statue sitting upon a plinth to be dusted, and the life of Buddha will not increase.{{sfn|Jiyu-Kennett|2005|p=225}}}}

To deepen the initial insight of kensho, shikantaza and kōan-study are necessary. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by [[Linji Yixuan]] in his [[Linji Yixuan#Three Mysterious Gates|Three mysterious Gates]], the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]],{{sfn|Low|2006}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]]{{sfn|Mumon|2004}} which detail the steps on the [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|Path]].

===Seitai choyo===
Post-awakening practice is called ''seitai choyo'', the "long nurturing of the sacred fetus".{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=145}}{{refn|group=note|According to Kraft, one of the earliest expressions of this term is found in a 5th-century Chinese translation of the ''Prajnaparamitra Sutra on Benevolent Kings Protecting Their Countries''.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=41}} In Chán-texts the term is first used by [[Mazu Daoyi|Mazu]] (709-788), and in Japan it was introduced by [[Dogen]] who learned it from his teacher T'ien t'ung Ju-ching (1163-1228).{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=41}} See also Muso Soseki, ''Dialogues in a Dream translation'', translated by Thomas Yuho Kirchner, for its meaning and application.}} According to Spiegelberg,
{{quote|[I]t means a return to the purely secular life, a complete submersion in work and in the changing events of the world. Thus, for decades, many Zenists, after their awakening, went among the people, living among beggars and leading an existence of hard physical labor. Thus it was proved whether or not the truth received was of permanent value, or whether it would vanish among mundane affairs.{{sfn|Spiegelberg|1957}}}}

During the T'ang-era, the term became associated with the ideal of the recluse who leaves the world.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=41-42}} An ideal period of "twenty years" was taken for it, echoing a story from the ''Lotus Sutra'' about a prodigal son who wandered in poverty for twenty years before returning home.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=42}} References to these twenty years are found throughout the Chán-tradition, for example Linji, who is reported to have studied under Huang-po for twenty years,{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=42}} and Daito, the founder of [[Daitoku-ji]], who famoulsy spent twenty years living under a bridge with beggars.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=42}}

===Cultivating bodhicitta===
According to Hakuin, the main aim of [[Dharma transmission#Further practice|"post-satori practice"]]{{sfn|Waddell|2004|p=xxv-xxvii}}{{sfn|Hakuin|2004|p=33-34}}{{sfn|Hisamatsu|2002|p=22}} (''gogo no shugyo''{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=145}} or ''kojo'', "going beyond"{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=144}}) is to cultivate the [[Bodhicitta|"Mind of Enlightenment"]],{{sfn|Hakuin|2004|p=33}}{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41}} "benefiting others by giving them the gift of the Dharma teaching".{{sfn|Hakuin|2004|p=34}}{{refn|group=note|Shinkichi Takahashi: "After satori, teach."{{sfn|Takahashi|2000|p=165}}}} According to [[Yamada Koun]], "if you cannot weep with a person who is crying, there is no kensho".{{sfn|MacInnes|2007|p=75}} And according to Barry 
{{quote|Post-satori practice for Hakuin meant finally ceasing to be preoccupied with his own personal condition and attainment and to devote himself and his practice to helping and teaching others. Finally, at long last, he realized that true enlightenment is a matter of endless practice and compassionate functioning, not something that occurs once and for all in one great moment on the cushion.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://buddhism.about.com/od/enlightenmentandnirvana/a/What-Is-Enlightenment.htm Barbara O'Brien, ''What Is Enlightenment? And How Do You Know When You've "Got" It?'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also Katsuhiro Yoshizawa, ''The Religious Art of Zen Master Hakuin'', pp.41-45, "Constant practice of the Four Universal Vows".{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41-45}}}}}}

===Further practice===
One also has to purify oneself by ongoing practice,{{sfn|Low|2006|p=33-34}}{{sfn|Glassman|2007|p=54}} since 
{{quote|Kensho does not eradicate our unhealthy habits [...] There is a sudden awakening to the fact of "no-self" and then this insight has to be integrated into one's life which means that it has to be embodied and not just be a memory.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.tricycle.com/online-retreats/great-heart-zen/entering-heart-zen Gerry Reply by Gerry Shishin Wick]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And "experience" has to be supplemented by intellectual understanding and study of the Buddhist teachings;{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=295-297}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=35-37}}{{sfn|Kim|2007|p=115}} otherwise one remains a ''zen temma'', a "Zen devil".{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=297}} Finally, these efforts are to result in a natural, effortless, down-to-earth state of being, the "ultimate liberation", "knowing without any kind of defilement".{{sfn|Low|2006|p=37-39}}

==Sudden insight==
{{Main|Subitism}}

Kenshō is described as [[Enlightenment in Buddhism#Sudden and gradual|appearing suddenly]], upon an interaction with someone else, at hearing or reading some significant phrase, or at the perceiving of an unexpected sound or sight.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} The idea of "sudden insight" has been [[Chinese Chán#Shenhui and Huineng|hotly debated]] in the history of Zen. It became part of the [[Zen#Traditional Zen Narrative (TZN)|Traditional Zen Narrative]] in the 8th century.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

[[Jinul|Chinul]], a 12th-century Korean Seon master, emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full Buddhahood. The contemporary Korean Seon master [[Seongcheol]] opposed this, emphasizing [[Seongcheol#Sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation|"sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation"]]. But Jiyu-Kennett, a contemporary western teacher, warns that attaining kenshō does not mean that a person is free from morality, the laws of karma, or the consequences of ones actions.{{sfn|Jiyu-Kennett|1979|p=51}} This warning is reflected in the [[Wild fox koan]].

==Mushi-dokugo and mushi-dokkaku==
{{Main|Mushi-dokugo}}

Kenshō may be attained without the aid of a teacher,{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=138-139}} as in the case of [[mushi-dokugo]]{{sfn|Faure|2000|p=48}} or (mushi-)dokkaku, a self-awakened [[pratyeka-buddha]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.sanbo-zen.org/kyosho_350_e.pdf Kyosho. The Awakening Gong. No.350, September/October 2011. Pages 14-15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628090745/http://www.sanbo-zen.org/kyosho_350_e.pdf |date=2013-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the literal meaning is self-awakened, or awakened on one's own, the emphasis in Zen, when using these terms, lies in the ultimate reliance on one's own insight, instead of the authority of a teacher:
{{quote|It is awakening that is one's true master.  With Shakyamuni, the awakening was his master.  In other words, the awakened self is one's master.  Apart from getting awakened to that master, there is no awakening.  Here practitioner and master are of one body, not two.  Instead of having another verify or confirm one's awakening, one does so for oneself.  Of course in this case the self that is verified and the master who does verification are undivided.  In their being completely identical is the autonomous, independent, or ultimate nature of the authenticity.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.fas.x0.com/writings/hisamatsu/onmutuallygoingintothematterofself.htm Shin'ichi Hisamatsu, ''On Mutually Going Into The Matter Of Self'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Similarities with other traditions==
While the Japanese term "kenshō" is generally used by practitioners of Zen Buddhism, the insight it refers to is not limited to Japanese Zen Buddhism, or even to Buddhism in general.{{sfn|Lathouwers|2000}}{{sfn|Grimstone|1985|p=13}}

===Theravada===
{{Main|Theravada|Vipassana|Vipassana movement}}

The [[Theravada]] tradition, which is best known in the west through the modern [[Vipassana movement]], discerns [[four stages of enlightenment]], in which [[Nirvana]] is being reached in four succeeding sudden steps of insight.

===Dzogchen===
{{Main|Dzogchen|Rigpa}}

The Dzogchen-traditions states that the ultimate nature of all sentient beings is ''pure, all-encompassing, primordial awareness'', or ''naturally occurring timeless awareness''. This intrinsic awareness has no form of its own, and yet is capable of perceiving, experiencing, reflecting, or expressing all form. It does so without being affected by those forms in any ultimate, permanent way.

The analogy given by Dzogchen masters is that one's nature is like a mirror which reflects with complete openness, but is not affected by the reflections. [[Rigpa]] is the knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity,{{sfn|Namdak|2006|p=97}} which cannot be found by searching nor identified.{{sfn|Third Dzogchen Rinpoche|2008|p=152}} One ''knows'' that there is a primordial freedom from grasping his or her mind.{{sfn|Namdak|2006|p=144-145}}

===Advaita Vedanta===
{{Main|Advaita Vedanta|Neo-Advaita}}

In Advaita Vedanta [[moksha]] is attained by [[jnana]], insight-knowledge. In [[Shankaracharya|Shankara's]] philosophical synthesis insight [[samadhi]] is used as a subsidiary to this goal. [[Swami Vivekananda]] emphasized the ''experience'' of nirvikalpa samadhi as a means to validate religious, transcendental knowledge.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}

{{pp-move-indef}}

"'''Knockout game'''" is one of the names given in the United States by news media and others to assaults in which one person (with others acting as accomplices or lookouts) attempt to "knock out", with a single [[sucker punch]], an unsuspecting victim. The assaults have similarities to the [[happy slapping]] trend seen in Europe, in which [[camera phone]]s are used to record assaults. Other names given to assaults of this type include "'''knockout'''", "'''knockout king'''", "'''point 'em out, knock 'em out'''", and "'''polar-bearing'''" or "'''polar-bear hunting'''" (allegedly called such when the victim is white and the assailants are not).&lt;ref name=nbcpolar/&gt;&lt;ref name=nypostpolar /&gt;&lt;ref name=cbspolar/&gt;

Serious injuries and even deaths have been attributed to the knockout game. Some news sources report that there was an escalation of such attacks in late 2013, and, in some cases, the attacker was charged with a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref name=nbcpolar/&gt;&lt;ref name="DN CH"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jweek1/&gt; Other media analysts, such as Slate, have cast doubt on the reportedly widespread nature of the game and have labeled the trend, although not the attacks themselves, a [[Urban legend|myth]].&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite web|last=Roller|first=Emma|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/11/25/why_the_knockout_game_trend_is_a_myth.html|title=Why the 'Knockout Game' trend is a myth|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Melanie|last=Eversley|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/26/knockout-game-myth/3729635|title=Reports: Alleged Trend of 'knockout game' a myth|work=[[USA Today]]|date=November  26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;

==History of attacks==
===1992–2009===
{{see also|Murder of Yngve Raustein|Happy slapping}}
In September 1992, Norwegian exchange student [[Murder of Yngve Raustein|Yngve Raustein]] was killed by three teenagers who—according to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], prosecutors—were playing a game called "knockout." Local teens said that the object is to render an unsuspecting target unconscious with a single punch, and, if the assailant does not succeed, his companions will turn on him instead.&lt;ref name=yngve&gt;{{cite news|title=MIT student's death attributed to violent "knockout" game|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2pZGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lvgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6167,4733376&amp;dq=violent+knockout+game&amp;hl=en|accessdate=February 11, 2016|newspaper=[[The Day (New London)|The Day]]|date=1992-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 in the United Kingdom, [[BBC News]] reported on the [[happy slapping]] incidents, in which the attacks were filmed for the purpose of posting online.&lt;ref name=DoesHappy&gt;{{cite news|last=Akwagyiram|first=Alexis|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4539913.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Does 'happy slapping' exist?|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-05-12|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French government responded to this trend by making it illegal to film any acts of violence and post them online, with a spokesperson for then President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] saying that the law was indeed directed at "happy slapping."&lt;ref name=FrenchSlap&gt;{{cite news|last=Kannampilly|first=Ammu|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=2936331 |title=French Slap Back at 'Happy Slappers'|publisher=ABC News|date=March 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three teens were arrested in [[Decatur, Illinois]], in September 2009, and charged in the killing of a bicyclist, 61, who was stomped to death, and the attempted murder of another man, 46, who was also attacked and stomped. It was claimed that the teens were playing "point 'em out, knock 'em out," where a person is selected and a group of attackers attempts to render the victim unconscious.&lt;ref name=TeensArraigned&gt;{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Ingram|url=http://herald-review.com/news/local/article_88214bad-f545-503b-8d8a-ecfa2b4dae29.html|title=Teens arraigned for Decatur murder|work=[[Herald &amp; Review]]|date=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt;

In June 2009, a 29-year-old man was beaten in a [[Columbia, Missouri]], parking garage by a group of teens who told police that they were playing a game called "knockout king," where they would find an unsuspecting person and attempt to knock him out with a single punch.&lt;ref name=ViolenceFor/&gt;

===2011–2013===
In April 2011, Hoang Nguyen, 72, died in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], after he was attacked in what was described by a local [[CBS]] station as "part of the so-called knockout game". Nguyen's wife, Yen, 62, was injured. After the trial, the assailant, Elex Murphy, a teenager who was 18 at the time of the assault, was sentenced to life in prison plus 25 years.&lt;ref name=ViolenceFor&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jennifer|last1=Mann|first2=Marlon A.|last2=Walker|title=Violence for fun may be spreading among teens|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/article_a234c676-46b7-5c66-a193-dd09fc49d8b8.html|newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2013/05/02/elex-murphy-gets-life-plus-25-years-for-knockout-game-murder|title=Elex Murphy Gets Life Plus 25 Years for Knockout Game Murder|publisher=[[KMOV]]|date=2013-05-02|accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=king&gt;{{cite news|first=Chad|last=Garrison|date=2011-04-21|title=Elex Murphy: St. Louis Teen Allegedly Killed Elderly Immigrant As Part Of Game|url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2011/04/elex_murphy_murder_hoang_nguyen_st_louis_immigrant_vietnam.php|newspaper=Riverfront Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jennifer|last1=Mann|date=2013-05-03|title='Knockout game' widow tells of lonely life after husband's murder|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/knockout-game-widow-tells-of-lonely-life-after-husband-s/article_636cb831-f292-5238-b70d-5e523205ff1f.html|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, 62-year-old Delfino Mora was attacked by three teens and killed in West [[Rogers Park, Chicago]]. Anthony Malcolm, who recorded the attack on his cell phone and publicized it, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Two other teens were awaiting trial in September 2013. The attack was said to be part of a game called "pick 'em out, knock 'em out."&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;{{cite web|last=Moser|first=Whet|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/July-2012/Point-Em-Out-Knock-Em-Out-Knockout-King-Happy-Slapping-and-Random-Street-Violence|title='Point Em Out Knock Em Out,' 'Knockout King', 'Happy Slapping', and the Murder of Delfino Mora|publisher=Chicagomag.com|date=2012-07-18|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/22522995-761/30-year-sentence-for-teen-in-videotaped-beating-death-of-delfino-mora.html|title=30-year sentence for teen in taped beating death of Delfino Mora|publisher=Suntimes.com|date=2013-09-12|accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a series of these attacks resulted in the deaths of the victims, all with some sort of game as a precipitating factor. Michael Daniels, 51, of [[Syracuse, New York]] died a day after being attacked in May 2013, with the "knockout game" later mentioned in regard to his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2013-05-30|title=A punch from nowhere, and Michael Daniels' rough life ends in a senseless beating|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/05/michael_daniels_rough_life_end.html|agency=Syracuse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/attacks-around-us-probed-knockout-game-215216013.html|title=Attacks around US probed for link to Knockout Game|agency=Associated Press|date=2013-11-21|accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Yale Daily News]]'' reported seven attacks during November 2013 in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] that could be associated with the knockout game. [[Yale University]]'s chief of police wrote an email to the campus community pertaining to the issue on November 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2013/12/05/police-respond-to-knockout-threat|title=Police respond to knockout threat|publisher=Yale Daily News|date=2013-12-05|accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted "a growing log of reports of such crimes in the Northeast and beyond".&lt;ref name=times/&gt; A number of news stories in late November 2013 covered incidents in [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn]], where a series of attacks took place during October and November of that year.&lt;ref name="DN CH"&gt;{{cite news|first=Thomas|last=Tracy|date=November 12, 2013|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/alleged-assaults-rock-crown-heights-article-1.1514604|title=NYPD investigating Crown Heights 'knockout' attacks on Jews as possible hate crimes|work=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jweek1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jonathan|last=Mark|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new-york-news/knockout-attacks-concern-crown-heights|title='Knockout' Attacks A Concern|publisher=The Jewish Week|date=2013-11-20|accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chinfo-11-12-13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crownheights.info/crime/410708/media-coverage-cbs-abc-report-on-knockout-jews-assaults|title=Media Coverage: CBS, ABC, NBC and Daily News Report on 'Knockout' Assaults|publisher=Crownheights.info|date=2013-11-12|accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DNA"&gt;{{cite web|first=Sonja|last=Sharp|date=November 25, 2013|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131125/crown-heights/brooklyn-jewish-leaders-offer-1500-reward-for-knockout-game-arrests|title=Brooklyn Jewish Leaders Offer $1,500 Reward for 'Knockout Game' Arrests|publisher=DNAinfo|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126054253/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131125/crown-heights/brooklyn-jewish-leaders-offer-1500-reward-for-knockout-game-arrests|archivedate=November 26, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Yori|last=Yanover|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/crown-heights-knockout-the-jew-attacks-serial-hate-crimes/2013/11/14|title=Crown Heights 'Knockout the Jew' Attacks Serial Hate Crimes|publisher=The Jewish Press|date=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] responded by stepping up patrols in certain neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Liz|last1=Fields|first2=Gillian|last2=Mohney|date=November 24, 2013 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/knockout-game-suspect-charged-hate-crime/story?id=20992590|title='Knockout Game' Suspect Charged With Hate Crime|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 24, 2013, in [[Katy, Texas]], an 81-year-old African-American man was attacked and hospitalized. Two weeks later, Conrad Alvin Barrett, 29, was arrested after allegedly showing an off-duty police officer a video he recorded with his cell phone of himself perpetrating the attack and explicitly referencing "knockout". Investigators revealed that there were other videos on his phone in which he used racial epithets and another in which he wondered if he would receive media attention if he were to commit a "knockout game" attack on a black man. This was one of the first cases in which the victim was African-American. Previous instances in the US primarily involved white or Asian victims and African-American assailants. The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] subsequently charged Barrett with a hate crime, the only time the DOJ involved itself in prosecuting these attacks. Barrett's attorney claimed his client suffers from [[bipolar disorder]] and was not on medication at the time of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khou.com/story/news/2014/07/24/12294464|title=Katy Man Charged With Hate Crime For Breaking Jaw Of Elderly Man In 'Knockout Game' Attack|publisher=[[KHOU]]|date=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=9372582|title=Katy Man Charged With Hate Crime For Breaking Jaw Of Elderly Man In 'Knockout Game' Attack|publisher=Abclocal.go.com|date=2013-12-27|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-man-charged-with-hate-crime-after-knockout-attack|title=Texas Man Charged With Hate Crime After 'Knockout' Attack|publisher=CBS News|date=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jocelyn|last1=Lane|first2=Chelsea J.|last2=Carter|date=December 28, 2013|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/27/justice/texas-knockout-charge|title=FBI Agent Quotes Texas Man Bragging About 'Knockout, Baby!'|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/27/22074834-texan-charged-with-hate-crime-for-knockout-game-hit-denied-bail?lite|title=Texan Charged With Hate Crime For 'Knockout Game' Hit Denied Bail|publisher=Usnews.nbcnews.com|date=2013-12-27|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Dinan|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/26/federal-authorities-charge-white-knockout-suspect-|title=Federal Authorities Charge White 'Knockout' Suspect With Hate Crime|work=The Washington Times|date=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Barrett was sentenced to 71 months (5 years and 11 months) in federal incarceration.

On December 3, newly elected [[African-American]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] New York City councilwoman [[Laurie Cumbo]] added a letter to her Facebook page saying: "The accomplishments of the Jewish community triggers feelings of resentment, and a sense that Jewish success is not also their success." The Anti-Defamation League said her post was "troubling" and that it evoked "classic anti-Semitic stereotypes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/councilwoman-black-jewish-resentment-talk-slammed-article-1.1538099|title=NYC councilwoman's talk of black-Jewish resentment, 'knockouts' called racist|publisher=NY Daily News|date=2013-10-21|accessdate=2013-12-08|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumbo later issued an apology for the remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collive.com/show_news.rtx?id=28096&amp;alias=cumbo-regrets-her-knockout|title=Cumbo Regrets Her Knockout|publisher=Collive.com|date=2013-12-10|accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crownheights.info/crown-heights-news/416795/councilwoman-apologizes-for-insensitive-comments|title=Councilwoman Apologizes for Insensitive Comments|publisher=Crownheights.info|date=2013-12-10|accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumbo added that the lives of victims and suspects will never be the same and that attackers would be "prosecuted to the full extent of the law".&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt; NYPD Commissioner [[Raymond Kelly]] later stated that he was avoiding referring to the attacks as part of any sort of trend to avoid further copycat attacks and has instead been labeling them as hate crimes.&lt;ref name=msnphilly/&gt;

Leaders from the African-American community also made statements. New York City councilman [[Charles Barron]] stated that the root of the problem was a need for jobs to keep young people out of trouble; he also suggested additional funding for community patrols to act as [[lookout]]s.&lt;ref name="lack of job"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/community-leaders-in-east-new-york-blame-lack-of-jobs-for-knockout-game-violence-1.6507548|title=Community leaders in East New York blame lack of jobs for knockout game violence|publisher=Brooklyn.news12.com|date=2013-11-27|accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representative [[Hakeem Jeffries]] said at a Crown Heights Youth Collective conference that attacks based on race will not be tolerated and that the collective will do everything in its power to see that justice is done.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt; Brooklyn's then-[[District Attorney]]-elect [[Kenneth P.

==Criticism of reporting==
{{undue weight|section|date=November 2015}}
The existence of a growing trend of knockout attacks has been questioned; claims about the prevalence of the phenomenon have been called an "urban myth" and a "type of panic" by some political analysts.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

A June 2011 investigative report by John Tucker of the ''[[Riverfront Times]]'' following the death of Hoang Nguyen in 2011 saw many related attacks, all attributed to the "Knockout King" game. St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department Chief Daniel Isom stated that a year prior the police determined that the knockout game was played by a group of children who went around trying to knock random people unconscious. The police estimated the activity was not widespread and limited to five or nine teens. In Tucker's interviews with local teens, they believed the number to be much higher; one 18-year-old estimated 10-15% of his peers played the game. A St. Louis area barber said that in his youth the phenomenon was not called "Knockout King" but "One Hitter Quitter". [[Mike Males]] of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice claimed that the media has been cherry-picking related attacks for sensationalism, asserting that "This knockout-game legend is a fake trend." Police at the time believed such attacks might have been under-reported by immigrant victims in communities where relations with law enforcement had been tense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John H. Tucker|url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2011-06-09/news/knockout-king-elex-murphy-hoang-nguyen-dutchtown-murder/full|title=Knockout King: Kids call it a game. Academics call it a bogus trend. Cops call it murder|publisher=Riverfront Times|date=2011-06-09|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attack from 2012 in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] was tentatively linked to more recent attacks, although it was never identified as part of any "game".&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Police in [[Syracuse, New York]], reported that one assailant in a fatal attack admitted to its being "knockout", with a police sergeant noting that the assaults he was investigating were definitely "for a game" rather than being attempted murders or robberies.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/nyregion/knockout-game-a-spreading-menace-or-a-myth.html?_r=1&amp;|title=Police Unsure if Random Attacks Are Rising Threat or Urban Myth|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2013-11-23|first=Cara|last=Buckley|date=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On November 23, 2013, ''The New York Times'' reported that police officials in New York City were considering their position on the "game" and were wondering if they should advise the public, but had to contend with the uncertain existence of the game.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; Police in New York City questioned whether they were faced with a trend or a series of isolated incidents.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/22/justice/knockout-game-teen-assaults|title=Police keep close eye on reports of disturbing 'knockout' game|publisher=CNN|date=2013-11-22|accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-New York Police Commissioner [[Raymond Kelly]] refused to refer to the attacks in Brooklyn as the "knockout game" to avoid possible copycat attacks.&lt;ref name=msnphilly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.msn.com/crime-justice/knockout-game-a-crime-trend-or-random-violence|title='Knockout game': A crime trend or random violence?|publisher=News.msn.com|accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several assaults associated with the knockout game do not follow any particular pattern; in several instances, a single assailant attempted a one-punch attack while in others multiple assailants participated in a gang attack. The "Knockout King" death of Nguyen in St. Louis was such a gang attack. A purported trend was identified in [[Lansing, Michigan]] called "point 'em out, knock 'em out" involved the use of a [[Taser]].&lt;ref name=msnphilly/&gt;

Many officials have outright refused to refer to the assaults as a "game", with Philadelphia Mayor [[Michael Nutter]] explicitly stating he did not want to give the idea any credibility while at a press conference after an attack at a Philadelphia pizzeria where the suspects never mentioned the game.&lt;ref name=msnphilly/&gt; In a [[CNN]] interview with [[Don Lemon]], Nutter stated he was not sure if the knockout game is real or not, adding he less concerned about the name but saying the incidents are of "great concern" and could spark copycat behavior. Nutter would not answer if the attacks were racially motivated and stated that Philadelphia has no confirmed "game" incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Simon|last=van Zuylen-Wood|url=http://www.phillymag.com/news/2013/12/04/mike-nutter-cnn-dont-know-knockout-game-real|title=Mike Nutter on CNN: I Don't Know If Knockout Game Is Real|publisher=Phillymag.com|date=2013-12-04|accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, Philadelphia Police spokeswoman Tanya Little determined a November 11 attack as part of a knockout game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-11-24/news/44391897_1_knockout-game-south-philadelphia-assault|title=Police: Recent assault was 'knockout game'|publisher=Articles.philly.com|date=2013-11-24|accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamelle Bouie of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' was critical of the game's existence as a trend, comparing its existence to the "wilding" assault allegedly at hand in the [[Central Park jogger case]] and the often reported [[Headlight flashing#Urban legend|headlight flashing urban legend]]. While he did not deny that several people were attacked and one had died, he pointed out that the attacks were not really rare, noting the FBI had reported 127,577 unarmed assaults in 2012.&lt;ref name=beast&gt;{{cite web|last=Bouie|first=Jamelle|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/25/guess-what-the-knockout-game-is-america-s-latest-phony-panic.html|title=Guess What?

When Singal approached several local news stations, a representative from an [[NBC]] affiliate responded saying that the footage had been taken from a shared pool of stock footage that other NBC stations in the area were given, and generally, if the footage is found to be inaccurate there would be a digital note concerning it. The note was absent in the case of the London video for reasons unknown. Singal's investigation led him to believe that people around the country are being told a story that has not been properly researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Singal|first=Jesse|url=http://www.cjr.org/minority_reports/knockout_video_misuse.php?page=all|title='Knockout' reports illustrated with unrelated footage: Columbia Journalism Review|publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=2013-11-27|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Hayes (journalist)|Chris Hayes]], host of [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[All In with Chris Hayes]]'', gave the knockout game his first annual "Over-Covered Stories of the Year" award, due to what he perceived as excessive coverage by Fox News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilstein|first=Matt|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/chris-hayes-blames-fox-news-for-2013s-most-over-covered-story|title=Chris Hayes Blames Fox News for 2013′s Most ‘Over-Covered’ Story|publisher=[[Mediaite]]|date=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robin Abcarian for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' criticized this reporting style by a conservative analyst, saying that blame was shifted onto the federal government. Abcarian noted that Barrett explicitly stated he was seeking a black victim, and postulated that he may have been acting on this "lazy narrative that black teens were randomly attacking white people". She criticized the statement by Rev. Sharpton and the conservative news sources who began supporting him after decades of opposition.&lt;ref name=abcariancrazy&gt;{{cite news|first=Robin|last=Abcarian|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-why-this-version-of-the-knockout-game-makes-conservatives-crazy-20131230,0,5557347,full.story#axzz2pRagcVrZ|title=Why this version of the 'knockout game' makes conservatives crazy|publisher=latimes.com|date=2013-12-30|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tommy Christopher, writing for [[Mediaite]], claimed [[James Rosen (journalist)|James Rosen]]'s report for [[Fox News]] on the attack was misleading, noting claims made by Rosen that it is the first such attack to be charged as a hate crime, when it was the first under federal statute. Christopher cited the arrest of Amrit Marajh in Brooklyn and the investigation of the alleged assault on Taj Patterson, a gay black man who claimed he was attacked by a group of Orthodox Jewish men, as proof of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-airs-inaccurate-report-on-media-fueled-knockout-game-hate-crime-against-elderly-black-man|title=Fox Airs Misleading Report on 'Knockout Game' Hate Crime Against Elderly Black Man|publisher=Mediaite|date=2013-11-23|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/taj-patterson-gay-black-student-beaten-brooklyn-possible-knockout-game-attack-claims-orthodox-jews|title=Taj Patterson, Gay Black Student Beaten In Brooklyn In Possible Knockout Game Attack, Claims Orthodox Jews Assaulted Him|publisher=Ibtimes.com|date=2013-12-10|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/black-student-hasidic-men-attacked-williamsburg-article-1.1542946|title=Black fashion student says Hasidic men attacked him, shouted anti-gay slurs in Williamsburg|publisher=NY Daily News|date=2013-12-10|accessdate=2014-01-04|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abcarian criticized the reporting of this attack as possibly being related to the knockout game trend, as the alleged attackers sought out Patterson because he was gay rather than because he is black. She also brought up a case of a fabrication of a "knockout"-style attack, after the victim and her boyfriend revealed she had lied that she was attacked at random by a stranger and instead he had struck her, noting that the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' did not report the initial attack as a "knockout game" attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Byers|first=Christine|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/woman-made-up-knockout-game-story-after-boyfriend-hit-her/article_3d614541-f78d-51e8-95a9-98bcd8507e61.html|title=Woman made up 'knockout game' story after boyfriend hit her, St. Louis police say|publisher=Stltoday.com|date=2013-12-06|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abcarian claimed that the 2011 attack by Dajour Washington on James Addlesburger was being used for sensationalism. The video of the assault was shown by [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], which Addlesburger felt was being exploited and manipulated to fan racial hatred. Washington, who spent nine months in juvenile detention for the attack, appeared on ''[[Nightline]]'' in 2013 and claimed he had not attacked Addlesburger because he was white but rather because he was the only man present. Washington also claimed that at the time of the attack he had never heard of the "knockout game".&lt;ref name=abcarianfaux&gt;{{cite news|last=Abcarian|first=Robin|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-knockout-game-faux-media-trend-20131211,0,7338857,full.story|title=The 'knockout game' faux media trend has finally jumped the shark|publisher=latimes.com|date=2013-12-12|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* have used information which is not publicly available (insider dealing)
* have distorted the price-setting mechanism of financial instruments
* have disseminated false or misleading information

Market Abuse is split into two different aspects (under EU definitions):&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;
#[[Insider dealing]]: where a person who has information not available to other investors (for example, a director with knowledge of a takeover bid) makes use of that information for personal gain
#[[Market manipulation]]: where a person knowingly gives out false or misleading information (for instance, about a company's financial circumstances) in order to influence the price of a share for personal gain

In 2013/2014, the EU updated its legislation on market abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2013/130440/LDM_BRI(2013)130440_REV1_EN.pdf|author=Willemijn de Jong |title=Tackling financial market abuse in the EU|date=21 January 2013|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and harmonised criminal sanctions. In the [[Danish European Union opt-out referendum, 2015]], the Danish population rejected adoption of the 2014 market abuse directive ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32014L0057 2014/57/EU]) and much other legislation.

The [[University of California]] has been no stranger to sexual harassment, with substantial accusations reported yearly in the hundreds at all nine UC campuses, notably UC Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and San Diego. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/university-of-california-staff-faculty-sexual-misconduct-harassment-cases/|title=University of California releases details on 113 employee sexual misconduct cases |last=Press |first=Associated |date=2017-03-01 |work=CBS News |access-date=2018-10-22 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a landmark event at the [[University of California, Irvine]] spearheaded the removal and reprimanding of several campus officials and professors accused of sexual harassment and discrimination. In early July 2018, UC Irvine removed millionaire benefactor [[Francisco J.

Price in her book ''Directions in Sexual Harassment Law'' describes how “a major argument for why [laws against] sexual harassment won’t work in education is that issues of sexuality can’t be regulated (similar to the debate in employment) or that adolescent behavior is too unpredictable to be legally controlled” (Price 62). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-11-10|editor-last=MacKinnon|editor-first=Catharine A.|editor2-last=Siegel|editor2-first=Reva B.|title=Directions in Sexual Harassment Law|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.12987/yale/9780300098006.001.0001|doi=10.12987/yale/9780300098006.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finance ===
It has been noted that, although the [[financial services|financial industry]] is known to have a wide prevalence of sexual harassment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-harassment-breakingviews/breakingviews-citys-metoo-moment-is-tipping-point-and-catalyst-idUSKBN1FE2F2|title=City's #MeToo moment is tipping point and catalyst|date=January 25, 2018|agency=Reuters |access-date=January 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126070649/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-harassment-breakingviews/breakingviews-citys-metoo-moment-is-tipping-point-and-catalyst-idUSKBN1FE2F2 |archive-date=January 26, 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of January 2018, there were no high-profile financial executives stepping down as the result of #MeToo allegations.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1188053/the-presidents-club-fallout-why-metoo-movement-will-not-affect-the-financial-world/|title=Why the financial world and big business will never have a #MeToo moment|last=Brinded|first=Lianna|website=Quartz |access-date=January 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126012855/https://qz.com/1188053/the-presidents-club-fallout-why-metoo-movement-will-not-affect-the-financial-world/|archivedate=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first widely covered example of concrete consequences in finance was when two reporters, including Madison Marriage of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', went [[undercover operation|undercover]] at a men-only [[Presidents Club]] event meant to raise money for children. Because women were not allowed to attend except as "hostesses" in tight, short black dresses with black underwear, Financial Times reporter Madison Marriage and another reporter got jobs as hostesses and documented widespread sexual misconduct. As a result, The presidents Club was shut down.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In March 2018, Morgan Stanley broker [[Douglas E. Greenberg]] was put on administrative leave after a ''New York Times'' story outlined harassment allegations by four women, including multiple arrests for the violation of restraining orders, and a threat to burn down an ex-girlfriend's house. It has been called the #MeToo moment of Portland's financial service industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2018/03/morgan_stanley_aware_of_abuse.html|title=Morgan Stanley knew of abuse allegations against Lake Oswego broker: report|work=OregonLive.com|access-date=March 30, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted in discussion of #MeToo in finance that only about a quarter of top positions are held by women at several major banks, and there is evidence there may be wide disparities in some financial institutions between how much men and women are paid on average.&lt;ref name=":47" /&gt;

The detective provided sexually suggestive text messages from Hancock sent to her while working for Hancock's [[security detail]] in 2012.

==== ME TOO bill in the US Congress ====
[[Jackie Speier]] proposed the Member and Employee Training and Oversight on Congress Act (ME TOO Congress Act) on November 15, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/11/15/564405871/me-too-legislation-aims-to-combat-sexual-harassment-in-congress|title='Me Too' Legislation Aims To Combat Sexual Harassment in Congress|publisher=NPR |access-date=January 22, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121201936/https://www.npr.org/2017/11/15/564405871/me-too-legislation-aims-to-combat-sexual-harassment-in-congress|archivedate=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full language of the bipartisan bill was revealed by the House on January 18, 2018 as an amendment to the [[Congressional Accountability Act of 1995]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-unveils-landmark-sexual-harassment-overhaul-bill-n838436|title=House unveils landmark sexual harassment overhaul bill|publisher=NBC News |access-date=January 22, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122073057/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-unveils-landmark-sexual-harassment-overhaul-bill-n838436|archivedate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the bill is to change how the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government treats sexual harassment complaints. Under the old system, complaints regarding the legislative branch were channeled through the [[United States Congress Office of Compliance|Office of Compliance]], which required complete confidentially through the process and took months of counseling and mediation before a complaint could actually be filed. Any settlement payments were paid using federal taxes, and it was reported that within a decade, $15&amp;nbsp;million of tax money had been spent settling harassment and discrimination complaints. The bill would ensure future complaints could only take up to 180 days to be filed. The bill would also allow the staffers to transfer to a different department or otherwise work away from the presence of the alleged harasser without losing their jobs if they requested it. The bill would require Representatives and Senators to pay for their own harassment settlements. The Office of Compliance would no longer be allowed to keep settlements secret, and would be required to publicly publish the settlement amounts and the associated employing offices. For the first time, the same protections would also apply to unpaid workers, including pages, fellows and interns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/360489-lawmakers-unveil-me-too-congress-bill-to-overhaul-sexual-harassment-policies|title=Lawmakers unveil 'ME TOO Congress' bill to overhaul sexual harassment policies|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|date=November 15, 2017|website=TheHill|access-date=January 4, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223010703/http://thehill.com/homenews/house/360489-lawmakers-unveil-me-too-congress-bill-to-overhaul-sexual-harassment-policies|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/17/congress-harassment-policy-scandals-345481|title=House unveils sweeping harassment overhaul after wave of scandals|website=POLITICO |access-date=January 22, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072858/https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/17/congress-harassment-policy-scandals-345481|archivedate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/17/578524736/bill-changes-how-congressional-sexual-harassment-claims-are-handled|title=Bill Changes How Congressional Sexual Harassment Claims Are Handled|publisher=NPR |access-date=January 22, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122024352/https://www.npr.org/2018/01/17/578524736/bill-changes-how-congressional-sexual-harassment-claims-are-handled|archivedate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports ===
Soon after #MeToo started spreading in late 2017, several allegations from a 2016 ''[[The Indianapolis Star|Indianapolis Star]]'' article re-surfaced in the gymnastic industry against former U.S. Gymnastics doctor [[Larry Nassar]] of [[Michigan State University]]. Nassar was called out via #MeToo for sexually assaulting gymnasts as young as 6 years old during "treatments".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/the-metoo-moment-for-us-gymnasts-olympics-nassar-justice.html|title=The #MeToo Moment: For U.S. Gymnasts, Why Did Justice Take So Long?|date=January 25, 2018|website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=January 25, 2018|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126182826/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/the-metoo-moment-for-us-gymnasts-olympics-nassar-justice.html|archivedate=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachael Denhollander]] was the first to call him out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadspin.com/it-began-with-rachael-denhollander-and-it-ends-with-her-1822388448|title=It Began With Rachael Denhollander And It Ends With Her|last=Meyers|first=Dvora|website=Deadspin |access-date=January 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125003835/https://deadspin.com/it-began-with-rachael-denhollander-and-it-ends-with-her-1822388448|archivedate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though nothing was done after the initial allegations came out in 2016, after more than 150 women came forward, Nassar was effectively sentenced to life in prison.

There have been discussions about how [[pornography]] is related to the emergence of the #MeToo movement, and what changes, if any, should be made to the porn industry in response.&lt;ref name=":010"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/07/me-too-anti-porn-conference-cosmopolitan-ban|title=The strange alliance between #MeToo and the anti-porn movement|last=Graves|first=Lucia|date=April 8, 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/danny-wylde-christopher-zeischegg-porn-814784|title=This ex-porn star is calling on #MeToo to include sex workers|date=February 21, 2018|work=Newsweek|access-date=April 11, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deaths of five female porn actresses during the first three months of 2018 inspired demands that workers in the industry be included as part of the #MeToo movement.&lt;ref name=":58"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43093080|title=Porn stars call for respect after spate of deaths|last=Fabbri|first=Thomas|date=March 26, 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been pointed out that many women and men have been sexually assaulted on set.&lt;ref name=":59"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/186887/what-will-it-take-for-the-porn-industry-to-have-its-metoo-moment#.YPIF6SWdc|title=What will it take for the porn industry to have its #MeToo moment?|access-date=April 11, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some high-profile pornographic performers have been accused of assault since the emergence of #MeToo, including [[James Deen]] and [[Ron Jeremy]].&lt;ref name=":58"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/insider/reporting-the-porn-industry.html|title=What It's Like to Report About the Porn Industry|last=Syckle|first=Katie Van|date=March 26, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/porns-two-biggest-male-stars-stand-accused-of-serial-sexual-assault-wheres-the-outrage|title=Porn's Two Biggest Male Stars Stand Accused of Serial Sexual Assault.

Several groups of [[Christian]]s, [[Conservatism|conservative]] women, and [[Radical feminism|radical feminists]] have argued that #MeToo demonstrates pornography causes women to be viewed as sexual objects and contributes to the prevalence of sexual harassment. As a result, these groups believe the production and consumption of pornography should be greatly restricted or made illegal.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

Other social advocates and feminists have responded by pointing out that attempts to suppress pornography in the U.S. have historically never been effective at reducing consumption. They note that porn consumption in the U.S. is currently at what is likely the highest levels in history, but overall levels of sexual violence and rape are far lower today than when the [[Anti-pornography movement in the United States|anti-pornography movement in the U.S.]] first emerged during the 1960s. Additionally, many feminists argue that laws which make pornography illegal only further restrict women as far what they are and are not allowed to do with their bodies.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

Many feminists have stated that pornography can be empowering or enjoyable for women and depicting female sexuality is not always objectification.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytrojan.com/2018/04/05/you-do-uterus-female-sexuality-isnt-always-objectification/|title=You Do Uterus: Female sexuality isn’t always objectification {{!}} Daily Trojan|date=April 5, 2018|work=Daily Trojan|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out that a lot of porn is made by women and for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alternet.org/conservative-trying-use-metoo-movement-ban-pornography|title=This Conservative Is Trying to Use the #MeToo Movement to Ban Pornography|last=Fenwick|first=Cody|date=February 12, 2018|work=AlterNet|access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Award-winning porn actress and director [[Angela White]] says there is a "large positive shift within the industry" to more women directing and producing their own content and "to represent women as powerful sexual beings."&lt;ref name=":58"/&gt; Anti-porn activist [[Melissa Farley]] has said this ignores the "choicelessness" faced by many actresses in porn.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt; Liberal advocates argue that anti-pornography movements in the U.S. have historically never tried to increase choices for vulnerable adult performers, and taking away a person's right to act in porn may hurt them economically by reducing their choices. Many adult performers have stated that the social stigma surrounding their type of work is already a major barrier when they're seeking help, and making porn illegal would leave them few options if they are suffering from sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":58"/&gt;

As a result of #MeToo, many adult performers, sex worker advocates and feminists have called for greater protections for pornographic actresses, for example reducing social stigmas, mandating training courses that teach performers their rights, and providing access to independent hotlines where performers can report abuse. They argue that making porn illegal would only cause the production of porn to go underground where there are even fewer options for help. Some liberal activists have argued to compromise by raising the legal age of entry into adult entertainment from 18 to 21, which would prevent some of the most vulnerable women from being taken advantage of, while allowing adult women to still do what they want with their own bodies.&lt;ref name=":58"/&gt;

Some have pointed out that many young people who do not receive a sex education adopt ideas about sex and sexual roles from pornography, whose fantasy depictions of those behaviors are not accurate to life, as they are designed for purposes of adult entertainment, and not educating the public on the reality of sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/magazine/teenagers-learning-online-porn-literacy-sex-education.html|title=What Teenagers Are Learning From Online Porn|date=February 7, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas of the United States teach [[Birth control|birth-control]] methods only by [[abstinence]] from sex.

Sex education can also effectively prepare children to identify and say no to unwanted sexual contact before it occurs, and gives parents an opportunity to teach children about consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/03/23/sex-ed-metoo-era-consent-parents/419690002/|title=Sex ed: Many parents wouldn't recognize it today -- and #metoo may change it even more|last=|first=|date=|work=USA TODAY|access-date=April 11, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose==
The original purpose of "Me Too" as used by Tarana Burke in 2006, was to empower women through empathy, especially young and vulnerable women. In October 2017, Alyssa Milano encouraged using the phrase as a hashtag to help reveal the extent of problems with sexual harassment and assault by showing how many people have experienced these events themselves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA" /&gt;

After millions of people started using the phrase, and it spread to dozens of other languages, the purpose changed and expanded, as a result, it has come to mean different things to different people. Tarana Burke accepts the title of the leader and creator of the movement but has stated she considers herself a worker of something much bigger. Burke has stated that this movement has grown to include both men and women of all colors and ages, as it continues to support marginalized people in marginalized communities.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snyder|first1=Chris|last2=Lopez|first2=Linette|title=Tarana Burke on why she created the #MeToo movement – and where it's headed|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12|website=[[Business Insider]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229055941/http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12|archivedate=December 29, 2017|date=December 13, 2017|access-date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/me-too-creator-tarana-burke-reminds-us-this-is-about-black-and-brown-survivors-20180104|title=Me Too creator Tarana Burke reminds us this is about Black and Brown survivors|last=Jeffries|first=Zenobia|website=[[Yes!

===Awareness and empathy===
Analyses of the movement often point to the prevalence of sexual violence, which has been estimated by the [[World Health Organization]] to affect one-third of all women worldwide. A 2017 poll by [[ABC News]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also found that 54% of American women report receiving "unwanted and inappropriate" sexual advances with 95% saying that such behavior usually goes unpunished. Others state that #MeToo underscores the need for men to intervene when they witness demeaning behavior.&lt;ref name=":262"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-10-25/how-metoo-has-awoken-women-around-the-world|title=How #MeToo has awoken women around the world|last=Radu|first=Sintia|date=October 25, 2017|website=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report|US News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106120413/https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-10-25/how-metoo-has-awoken-women-around-the-world |archive-date=January 6, 2018 |dead-url=no |access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/me-too-lets-men-off-the-hook_us_59e4e3a2e4b04d1d518390d2|title=The problem with asking women to say 'Me Too'|last=Chapin|first=Angelina|date=October 16, 2017|website=[[HuffPost]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102235158/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/me-too-lets-men-off-the-hook_us_59e4e3a2e4b04d1d518390d2|archivedate=January 2, 2018|deadurl=no|access-date=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/17/me-too-hashtag-sexual-harassment-at-work-stats/|title=A new poll on sexual harassment suggests why 'Me Too' went so insanely viral|last=Zillman|first=Claire|date=October 17, 2017|website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |access-date=January 13, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113093211/http://fortune.com/2017/10/17/me-too-hashtag-sexual-harassment-at-work-stats/|archivedate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alyssa Milano described the reach of #MeToo as helping society understand the "magnitude of the problem" and said, "it's a standing in solidarity to all those who have been hurt."&lt;ref name="People2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/movies/me-too-alyssa-milano-heads-twitter-campaign-against-sexual-harassment-assault/|title=#MeToo: Sexual harassment and assault movement tweeted over 500,000 times as celebs share stories|last=Petit|first=Stephanie|date=October 16, 2017|website=[[People (magazine)|People]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017014318/http://people.com/movies/me-too-alyssa-milano-heads-twitter-campaign-against-sexual-harassment-assault/|archivedate=October 17, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/01/alyssa-milano-mee-too-sexual-harassment-abuse|title=Alyssa Milano on the #MeToo movement: 'We're not going to stand for it any more'|last=Sayej|first=Nadja|date=December 1, 2017|website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=January 5, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102051427/https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/01/alyssa-milano-mee-too-sexual-harassment-abuse|archivedate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that the success of #MeToo will require men to take a stand against behavior that objectifies women.&lt;ref name=":272"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/alyssa-milano-why-i-joined-times-up-anti-sexual-misconduct-group-w514894|title=Alyssa Milano on joining time's up: 'women are scared; women are angry'|last=Milano|first=Alyssa |author-link=Alyssa Milano|date=January 4, 2018|website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=January 6, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106120433/https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/alyssa-milano-why-i-joined-times-up-anti-sexual-misconduct-group-w514894|archivedate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policies and laws===
Burke has stated the current purpose of the movement is to give people the resources to have access to healing, and advocates for changes to laws and policies. Burke has highlighted goals such as processing all untested [[rape kit]]s, re-examining local school policies, improving the vetting of teachers, and updating sexual harassment policies.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12|title=Tarana Burke on why she created the #MeToo movement – and where it's headed|last1=Snyder|first1=Chris|last2=Lopez|first2=Linette|date=December 13, 2017|website=[[Business Insider]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229055941/http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12|archivedate=December 29, 2017|deadurl=no|access-date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has called for all professionals who work with children to be [[fingerprint]]ed and subjected to a [[background check]] before being cleared to start work. She advocates for sex education that teaches kids to report predatory behavior immediately.&lt;ref name=":172" /&gt; Burke supports the #MeToo bill in the [[US Congress]], which would remove the requirement that staffers of the federal government go through months of "cooling off" before being allowed to file a complaint against a Congressperson.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;

Milano states a priority for #MeToo is changing the laws surrounding sexual harassment and assault, for example, instituting protocols that give sufferers in all industries the ability to file complaints without retaliation. She supports legislation making it difficult for publicly traded companies to hide cover-up money from their stockholders and would like to make it illegal for employers to require new workers sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s as a condition of employment.&lt;ref name=":272" /&gt; Gender analysts such as [[Anna North]] have stated that #MeToo should be addressed as a labor issue due to the economic disadvantages to reporting harassment. North suggested combating underlying power imbalances in some workplaces, for example by raising the tipped minimum wage, and embraces innovations like the "portable [[panic button]]s" that are mandated for hotel employees in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/27/16803610/sexual-misconduct-harassment-reckoning-metoo|title=What I've learned covering sexual misconduct this year|website=Vox |access-date=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118064612/https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/27/16803610/sexual-misconduct-harassment-reckoning-metoo|archivedate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have suggested that barriers to employment must be removed, such as the job requirement by some employers to sign non-disclosure agreements or other agreements that prevent an employee from talking about their employment publicly, or taking disputes (including sexual harassment claims) to arbitration or legal proceedings. It's been suggested that legislation should be passed that bans these types of mandatory pre-employment agreements.&lt;ref name=":65"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2018/01/31/445669/politics-policy-turning-corner-sexual-harassment/|title=From Politics to Policy: Turning the Corner on Sexual Harassment - Center for American Progress|date=January 31, 2018|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=April 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some policy-based changes that have been suggested is reducing limited managerial oversight; creating clear internal reporting mechanisms; more effective and proactive disciplinary measures; creating a culture that encourages employees to be open about serious problems;&lt;ref name=":65" /&gt; making financial penalties for workers who work for companies that allow those workers to remain in their position when they have repeatedly sexually harassed others; and force companies to pay huge fines or lose tax breaks if they decide to keep workers that are sexual harassers around.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=2f23c864-96db-4e51-9cb9-29daeb95d19b@pdc-v-sessmgr06&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=edsbig.A553402477&amp;db=edsbig|title=Time's Up: As the Me Too movement continues to shed light on sexual harassm...: Discovery Service for Loyola Marymount Univ|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media coverage===
In the coverage of #MeToo, there has been widespread discussion about the best way for sufferers of sexual abuse or harassment to stop what is happening to them at work. There is general agreement that a lack of effective reporting options is a major factor that drives unchecked sexual misconduct in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-women-sexcrimes/despite-metoo-u-s-workers-fear-speaking-out-about-sexual-harassment-idUSKBN1DA0NY|title=Despite #MeToo, U.S. workers fear speaking out about sexual harassment|date=November 10, 2017|agency=Reuters |access-date=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118011233/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-women-sexcrimes/despite-metoo-u-s-workers-fear-speaking-out-about-sexual-harassment-idUSKBN1DA0NY|archivedate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

False reports of sexual assault are rare but when they happen, they are put in the spotlight for the public to see. The media does this to portray the image that the majority of the reported sexual assaults are falsely reported by women. However, falsely reported sexual assaults only make up 3% of the total amount that are reported. This doesn’t even take into account the amount of women that still don’t report their stories. This is yet another reason why women are scared to report their experiences with sexual assault because they are afraid that no one will ever believe their story and in the process they will have embarrassed and humiliated themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/the-glaring-blind-spot-of-the-me-too-movement/546458/|title=The Glaring Blind Spot of the 'Me Too' Movement|last=White|first=Gillian B.|date=2017-11-22|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], a person who makes a sexual harassment complaint at work is reprimanded or fired 40% of the time, while the accused person is typically not investigated or punished.&lt;ref name=":332"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/world/europe/france-sexual-harassment.html|title='Revolt' in France Against Sexual Harassment Hits Cultural Resistance|last=Rubin|first=Alissa J.|date=November 19, 2017|website=The New York Times |access-date=January 15, 2018|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223074906/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/world/europe/france-sexual-harassment.html|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a 2016 report from the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] states that although 25–85% of women say they experience sexual harassment at work, few ever report the incidents, most commonly due to fear of reprisal.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; There is evidence that in [[Japan]], as few as 4% of rape victims report the crime, and the charges are dropped about half the time.&lt;ref name=":1522"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/metoo-sexual-assault-women-rights-japan/|title=Saying #MeToo in Japan|date=January 2, 2018|website=POLITICO |access-date=January 5, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106063552/https://www.politico.eu/article/metoo-sexual-assault-women-rights-japan/|archivedate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/world/asia/japan-rape.html|title=She Broke Japan's Silence on Rape|last=Rich|first=Motoko|date=December 29, 2017|website=The New York Times |access-date=January 17, 2018|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124054016/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/world/asia/japan-rape.html|archivedate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a discussion on the best ways to handle [[whisper network]]s, or private lists of "people to avoid" that are shared unofficially in nearly every major institution or industry where sexual harassment is common due to power imbalances, including government, media, news, and academia. These lists have the stated purpose of warning other workers in the industry and are shared from person-to-person, on forums, in private social media groups, and via [[spreadsheet]]s. However, these lists can become "weaponized" and used to spread unsubstantiated gossip, which has been discussed widely in the media.&lt;ref name=":110"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/what-whisper-network-sexual-misconduct-allegations-719009|title=What is a whisper network?

Defenders say the lists provide a way to warn other people in the industry if worried about punishment, or if complaints have already been ignored, and also helps victims identify each other so they can speak out together.&lt;ref name=":110" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":210" /&gt; Sometimes these lists are kept for other reasons, for example, a spreadsheet from the United Kingdom called "High Libido MPs" and dubbed "the spreadsheet of shame" was created by a group of male and female parliamentary researchers, and contained a list of allegations against nearly 40 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]. It is also rumored that [[whip (politics)|party whips]] (who are in charge of getting members of Parliament to commit to votes) maintain a "black book" that contains allegations against several lawmakers that can be used for [[blackmail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/sexual-harassment-british-parliament.html|title=Sexual Harassment Claims Surface in U.K. Parliament|last=Castle|first=Stephen|date=October 30, 2017|website=The New York Times |access-date=January 17, 2018|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118011016/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/sexual-harassment-british-parliament.html|archivedate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/30/uk-parliament-sexual-harassment-scandal/|title=Making Sense of the Lewd Sexual Harassment Scandal Roiling the U.K|website=Fortune |access-date=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031182703/http://fortune.com/2017/10/30/uk-parliament-sexual-harassment-scandal/|archivedate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dirty-dossier-accuses-mps-of-harassment-and-sex-in-offices-6f7q8kn8b|title=Dirty dossier accuses MPs of harassment and sex in offices|author1=Hannah McGrath|author2=Billy Kenber|date=October 30, 2017|website=The Times|access-date=January 17, 2018|issn=0140-0460|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is claimed a well-known person's sexual misconduct was an "open secret", these lists are often the source.&lt;ref name=":110" /&gt; In the wake of #MeToo, several private whisper network lists have been leaked to the public.&lt;ref name=":110" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":210"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/1/11/16878316/shitty-media-men-list-katie-roiphe-moira-donegan|title=The creator of the Shitty Media Men List has come forward.

In [[India]], a student gave her friends a list containing names of professors and academics in the Indian university system to be avoided. The list went viral after it was posted on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/09/health/india-me-too-allegations/index.html|title=#MeToo helps spark wider conversation around sexual abuse in India|last=CNN|first=Huizhong Wu,|publisher=CNN |access-date=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125143503/http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/09/health/india-me-too-allegations/index.html|archivedate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism in the media, the authors defended themselves by saying they were only trying to warn their friends, had confirmed every case, and several victims from the list were poor students who had already been punished or ignored when trying to come forward.&lt;ref name=":252"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/krantikali/raya-sarkar-and-all-the-lists-men-ae956f21eab1|title=Raya Sarkar and All The List's Men|date=October 24, 2017 |access-date=January 6, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106120435/https://medium.com/krantikali/raya-sarkar-and-all-the-lists-men-ae956f21eab1|archivedate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebetterindia.com/126213/me-too-hadiya-love-jihad-triple-talaq-2017-year-feminism-india/|title=#MeToo, Hadiya, Triple Talaq: How 2017 Was an Important Year for Indian Feminism|date=December 29, 2017|website=The Better India |access-date=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118011249/https://www.thebetterindia.com/126213/me-too-hadiya-love-jihad-triple-talaq-2017-year-feminism-india/|archivedate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moira Donegan]], a New York City-based journalist, privately shared a crowd-sourced [[Shitty Media Men|Shitty Media Men list]] of people to avoid in publishing and journalism. When it was shared outside her private network, Donegan lost her job. Donegan stated it was unfair so few people had access to the list before it went public; for example, very few women of color received access (and therefore protection) from it. She pointed to her "[[privilege (sociology)|whiteness, health, education, and class]]" that allowed her to take the risk of sharing the list and getting fired.&lt;ref name=":210" /&gt;

The main problem with trying to protect more potential victims by publishing whisper networks is determining the best mechanism to verify allegations in a way that is fair to all parties.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/10/16/16482800/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-workplace|title=It's time to weaponize the "whisper network"|work=Vox |access-date=January 27, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127143320/https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/10/16/16482800/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-workplace|archivedate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/10/18/how-whisper-networks-help-protect-women-harvey-weinsteins-world/759860001/|title=How 'whisper networks' help protect women from the Harvey Weinsteins of the world|work=USA Today |access-date=January 27, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127154813/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/10/18/how-whisper-networks-help-protect-women-harvey-weinsteins-world/759860001/|archivedate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggestions have included strengthening [[trade union|labor unions]] in vulnerable industries so workers can report harassment directly to the union instead of to an employer.

Dr. John Launer of [[Health Education England]] stated leaders must be made aware of common "mismatches of perceptions" at work to reduce incidents where one person thinks they are flirting while the other person feels like they're being demeaned or harassed.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Reporter [[Anna North]] from ''[[Vox Media|Vox]]'' states one way to address #MeToo is teach children the basics of sex. North states the cultural notion that women do not enjoy sex leads men "to believe that a lukewarm yes is all they're ever going to get", referring to a 2017 study which found that men who believe women enjoy being forced into sex are "more likely to perceive women as consenting".&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/16/16894722/aziz-ansari-grace-babe-me-too|title=The Aziz Ansari story is ordinary.

She says "preserving the nuances" is more inclusive and realistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2018/01/17/the-metoo-movement-is-at-a-dangerous-tipping-point/|title=Opinion: The #MeToo movement is at a dangerous tipping point|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|date=January 17, 2018|website=The Washington Post|access-date=January 17, 2018|issn=0190-8286|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117125828/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2018/01/17/the-metoo-movement-is-at-a-dangerous-tipping-point/|archivedate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Daniel W. Drezner|Daniel Drezner]] stated that #MeToo laid the groundwork for two major cultural shifts. One is the acceptance that sexual harassment (not just sexual assault) is unacceptable in the workplace. The other is that when a powerful person is accused of sexual harassment, the reaction should be a presumption that the less powerful accuser is "likely telling the truth, because the risks of going public are great." However, he states society is struggling with the speed at which change is being demanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/02/14/metoo-and-the-trouble-with-norms/|title=Perspective {{!}} #MeToo and the trouble with new norms|last=Drezner|first=Daniel W.|date=February 14, 2018|work=Washington Post|access-date=February 20, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and former [[Seduction community|pick-up artist]] [[Michael Ellsberg]] encourages men to reflect on past behavior and examples of questionable sexual behavior, such as the viral story [[Cat Person]], which is written from the perspective of a twenty-year-old woman who goes on a date with a much older man and ends up having an unpleasant sexual experience that was consensual but unwanted.

Relationship instructor Kasia Urbaniak said the movement is creating its own crisis around [[masculinity]]. "There's a reflective questioning about whether they’re going to be next and if they’ve ever hurt a woman. There's a level of anger and frustration. If you’ve been doing something wrong but haven't been told, there's an incredible sense of betrayal and it’ll provoke a backlash. I think silence on both sides is incredibly dangerous." Urbaniak says she would like women to be allies of men and to be curious about their experience. "In that alliance there's a lot more power and possibility than there is in men stepping aside and starting to stew."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/30/dominatrix-classes-be-more-assertive-work-and-life|title=Want to be more assertive in life?

==#HimToo==
{{main|Him Too movement}}
The related hashtag [[Him Too movement|#HimToo]] emerged in popularity with the #MeToo movement. Although dating back to at least 2015, and initially associated with politics or casual communication, #HimToo took on new meanings associated with #MeToo in 2017, with some using it to emphasize male victims of sexual harassment and abuse, and others using it to emphasize male perpetrators. In September and October 2018, during the [[Brett_Kavanaugh_Supreme_Court_nomination#Sexual_assault_allegations|sexual assault allegations raised during Brett Kavanaugh's nomination]] to the U.S. Supreme Court, #HimToo became used by supporters of Kavanaugh and to highlight male victims of false accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Amanda |title=#HimToo: Left And Right Embrace Opposing Takes On Same Hashtag |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/10/11/656293787/-himtoo-left-and-right-embrace-opposing-takes-on-same-hashtag |website=NPR.org |language=en |date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ellis |first1=Emma Grey |title=How #HimToo Became the Tagline of the Men’s Rights Movement |url=https://www.wired.com/story/brett-kavanaugh-hearings-himtoo-metoo-christine-blasey-ford/ |website=WIRED |date=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creator [[Tarana Burke]] has laid out specific goals for the #MeToo movement, including: processing all untested rape kits in the United States, investigating the vetting of teachers, better protecting children at school, updating sexual harassment policies, and improving training in workplaces, places of worship, and schools. She has stated that everyone in a community, including men and women, must take action in order to make the #MeToo movement a success. She also supports the #MeToo Congress bill and hopes it will inspire similar legal changes in other parts of the country.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Some actors have admonished proponents of the movement for not distinguishing between different degrees of sexual misconduct. [[Matt Damon]] commented on the phenomenon in an interview, and later apologized, saying "the clearer signal to men and to younger people is, deny it.

Tarana Burke said in January 2018, "Those of us who do this work know that backlash is inevitable." While describing the backlash as carrying an underlying sentiment of fairness, she defended her movement as "not a witch hunt as people try to paint it". She stated that engaging with the cultural critique in #MeToo was more productive than calling for it to end or focusing on accused men who "haven't actually touched anybody".&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; [[Ronan Farrow]], who published the Weinstein exposé in the [[The New Yorker|''New Yorker'']] that helped start the #MeToo resurgence (alongside ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporters [[Megan Twohey]] and [[Jodi Kantor]]), was asked in late December 2017 whether he thought the movement had "gone too far". Farrow called for a careful examination of each story to guard against false accusations but also recalled the alleged sexual abuse his sister Dylan Farrow claims she went through at the hands of his father [[Woody Allen]]. He stated that after decades of silence, "My feeling is that this is a net benefit to society and that all of the people, men, and women, pouring forward and saying 'me too' deserve this moment. I think you're right to say that we all have to be conscious of the risk of the pendulum swinging too far, but in general this is a very positive step."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Janice|url=http://www.newsweek.com/ronan-farrow-harvey-weinstein-metoo-755974|title=Will innocent men become 'casualities' of #MeToo movement?|date=December 21, 2017|website=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=January 5, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104131421/http://www.newsweek.com/ronan-farrow-harvey-weinstein-metoo-755974|archivedate=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist [[Steven Thrasher]] noted that, "There has been worry that the #MeToo movement could lead to a sex panic. But the real sex panic is not due to feminism run amok, but due to the patriarchal, homophobic, transantagonistic, theocratic desire of the US Congress to control sex workers." He points to 2018 [[Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act]] (SESTA), which many experts say will only put sex workers at further risk by causing them to go underground, does not offer sex workers any help or protections, and as a side effect prevents most people from using online personal ads regardless of their intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/29/sexual-freedom-fosta-sosta|title=Sexual freedom is at risk from these damning new bills passed by Congress {{!}} Steven W Thrasher|last=Thrasher|first=Steven W.|date=March 29, 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators have responded that the number of false reports is expected to be low, citing figures obtained by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and other organizations which estimate the number of [[false rape accusations]] to be around 2–10%.

Police sexual misconduct disproportionately affects women of color, though women from all walks of life are affected.&lt;ref name=":57" /&gt; The [[Cato Institute]] reported that in 2010, more than 9% of police misconduct reports in 2010 involved sexual abuse, and there are multiple indications that "sexual assault rates are significantly higher for police when compared to the general population."&lt;ref name=":56" /&gt; Fear of retribution is considered{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} one reason some law-enforcement officers are not subjected to significant consequences for known misconduct.&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt; Police-reform activist Roger Goldman stated that an officer who is fired for sexual misconduct from one police department often gets rehired by a different department, where they can continue the misconduct in a new environment.&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt; Some states (such as Florida and Georgia) have licensing laws that can decertify a law-enforcement officer who has committed major misconduct, which prevents decertified officers from being hired again in that state.&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt; Some have called for sexual misconduct allegations against police to be investigated by third parties to reduce bias (as opposed to the common practice of investigations being led by fellow law-enforcement officers or colleagues in the same department).&lt;ref name=":57" /&gt;

Minority women are overrepresented in industries with the greatest number of sexual harassment claims, for example hotels, health, food services, and retail.&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt; It has been pointed out that undocumented minority women often have no recourse if they're experiencing sexual violence.&lt;ref name=":54"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hollywood-having-metoo-moment-women-color-have-fought-battle-decades-n841121|title=Hollywood is having a #MeToo moment.

Former victim Farah Tanis stated there are also additional barriers for black women who want to participate in the #MeToo movement. She pointed out that there is often social pressure not to report allegations against black men, especially from church and family, because many would view that as a betrayal against their "brothers."&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Additionally, black women are less likely to be believed if they do speak out.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/black-women-metoo-antirape-movement#9|title=There Is No #MeToo Without Black Women|work=Healthline|access-date=April 7, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that the American judicial system acknowledges the term "sexual harassment" only because of successful sexual harassment lawsuits by three black women: [[Diane R. Williams|Diane Williams]] and Paulette Barnes against the US government, and Mechelle Vinson against a bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/|title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women|last=Lipsitz|first=Raina|date=October 20, 2017|work=The Nation|access-date=April 7, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinson's case of [[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]] eventually leading to the unanimous 1986 Supreme Court decision that sexual harassment violates the [[Civil Rights Act]].&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt; Black law professor [[Anita Hill]] again brought sexual harassment to public discourse in 1991 with her testimony against Supreme Court nominee [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]].&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/10/27/560231232/women-are-speaking-up-about-harassment-and-abuse-but-why-now|title=Women Are Speaking Up About Harassment And Abuse, But Why Now?|work=NPR.org|access-date=April 7, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarana Burke initially criticized the movement for ignoring the work of black women in creating dialogue addressing sexual assault. However, she did salute those who partook in the movement and credited Milano for acknowledging Burke's own similar movement.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebony.com/news-views/black-woman-me-too-movement-tarana-burke-alyssa-milano|title=Black woman Tarana Burke founded the 'Me Too' movement|last=Hill|first=Zahara|date=October 16, 2017|website=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|accessdate=October 17, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017035553/http://www.ebony.com/news-views/black-woman-me-too-movement-tarana-burke-alyssa-milano|archivedate=October 17, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this, she pleaded to black women not to drop out of the movement just because the media isn't listening saying "This is your movement, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tarana-burke-tells-black-women-me-too-is-your-movement-too_us_5b967c8fe4b0162f472f65f6|title=Tarana Burke Tells Black Women Me Too Is 'Your Movement, Too'|last=Vagianos|first=Alanna|date=September 10, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American feminist and journalist [[Gloria Steinem]] said there is a blind spot surrounding [[intersectionality]] between race and gender, and a major problem with today's feminists is they are not acknowledging "that women of color in general—and especially black women—have always been more likely to be feminist than white women."&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt; Steinem argues that #MeToo could never have happened without the work of these women, and women in the #MeToo movement have a responsibility: “If you have more power, remember to listen as much as you talk. And if you have less power, remember to talk as much as you listen."&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt;

=== Overemphasis on specific cases ===
The #MeToo movement has been criticized for putting too much public focus on the consequences of specific individuals who have been accused of sexual misconduct, as opposed to discussing policies and changes to institutional norms that would help people who are currently experiencing sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/6-perspectives-on-the-future-of-metoo/|title=6 Perspectives on the Future of #MeToo|last=Fonda|first=Jane|date=December 13, 2017|work=The Nation |access-date=February 1, 2018|last2=Covert|first2=Bryce|issn=0027-8378|last3=Pollitt|first3=Katha|last4=Meyerson|first4=Collier|last5=Lipsitz|first5=Raina|last6=Walsh|first6=Joan|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131001011/https://www.thenation.com/article/6-perspectives-on-the-future-of-metoo/|archivedate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's been noted that although allegations surrounding high-profile public figures tends to attract the most attention, the stories of regular workers often go unacknowledged.&lt;ref name=":65" /&gt; Yet to ensure meaningful change, these workers’ experiences must be at the center of any policy solutions that lawmakers pursue. Tarana Burke has voiced similar misgivings, pointing out one problematic aspect of #MeToo is "All of this media attention is on the perpetrator. All of the conversation about fairness and due process is focused on the perpetrator." She states the movement should focus on specific steps to help current and future sufferers.&lt;ref name=":173"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/me-too-creator-tarana-burke-reminds-us-this-is-about-black-and-brown-survivors-20180104|title=Me Too creator Tarana Burke reminds us this is about Black and Brown survivors|last=Jeffries|first=Zenobia|date=January 4, 2018|website=[[Yes!

==Financial support==
In May 2018, The New York Women's Foundation announced their Fund to Support the Me Too Movement and Allies, a $25M commitment over the next five years to provide funding and support survivors of sexual violence.[https://www.apnews.com/c07113f1a73047a589eedd1ef936fecb]

In September 2018, CBS announced that it would be donating $20 million of former Chairman Les Moonves' severance to #MeToo.  Moonves was forced to step down after numerous sexual misconduct accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tom McCarthy |title=Les Moonves resigns from CBS after six more women accuse him of sexual harassment |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/09/les-moonves-cbs-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-new-ronan-farrow-report |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=10 September 2018 |quote=Moonves and CBS will donate $20m to one or more organisations that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace.

=== Afghanistan ===
The #MeToo hashtag initially spread in [[Afghanistan]] where it is estimated about 90% of women experience sexual harassment in public, at school, or at work, but was quickly silenced when those who shared their stories started fearing for their life.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/20/metoo-afghanistan-anyone-listening|title=#MeToo in Afghanistan: Is Anyone Listening?|date=December 20, 2017|publisher=Human Rights Watch |access-date=January 19, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224101743/https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/20/metoo-afghanistan-anyone-listening|archivedate=December 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":111"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://impact.vice.com/en_us/article/qvwmz5/why-the-metoo-movement-has-failed-to-take-off-in-afghanistan|title=Women in Afghanistan Want Their #MeToo Moment, But Fear Retaliation|date=January 17, 2018|website=Impact |access-date=January 19, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119150256/https://impact.vice.com/en_us/article/qvwmz5/why-the-metoo-movement-has-failed-to-take-off-in-afghanistan|archivedate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 1% of police officers or military members are women, and sexual assault is often ignored by law enforcement and the military.&lt;ref name=":211"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/world/asia/afghan-metoo-women-harassment.html|title=Harassment All Around, Afghan Women Weigh Risks of Speaking Out|last=Nordland|first=Rod|date=December 10, 2017|website=The New York Times |access-date=January 19, 2018|last2=Faizi|first2=Fatima|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120124044/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/world/asia/afghan-metoo-women-harassment.html|archivedate=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape threats and other types of harassment are common on Facebook and other social media in Afghanistan. Sharing stories of sexual abuse against higher-ranking men is especially dangerous for women in the country, and may result in the killing of the victim or her family members.&lt;ref name=":111" /&gt; Some women are also punished or killed to by their own family for speaking out, to [[Honor killing|redeem their "honor"]] after being tarnished by rape.&lt;ref name=":111" /&gt; Despite the risks, some notable people such as ''Sarienews'' journalist Maryam Mehtar, and presidential advisor Shaharzad Akbar have shared their own #MeToo stories on social media. Mehtar experienced extreme abuse and several death threats for sharing her story about being sexually harassed in public on a daily basis, and was publicly called a "whore" in an interview with ''The New York Times'' by Afghan writer Jalil Junbish. He also called the NYT reporter a whore in the same interview. He later denied making the comments.&lt;ref name=":211" /&gt; Other women only share their first name or a fake name, and typically describe the story without naming the perpetrator for fear of reprisal.&lt;ref name=":211" /&gt; Sexual harassment was first defined in Afghanistan in 2016, though there has been little effort made to enforce laws against it.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Rod Nordland and Fatima Faizi of ''The New York Times'' reported that a colonel in the [[Afghan Air Force]] was secretly and clearly videotaped sexually assaulting a subordinate in November 2017, and the video quickly went viral, but despite an alleged investigation, the colonel has not been formally accused of misconduct.&lt;ref name=":211" /&gt; The Ministries of [[Ministry of Interior Affairs (Afghanistan)|Interior]] and [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (Afghanistan)|Communications]] set up a phone hotline to for women to call to report sexual misconduct from law enforcement officials, but a call to the line revealed the hotline will offer advice only about phone harassment, and stated if a person harasses you in person, to "slap them".&lt;ref name=":211" /&gt;

In October 2017 reporter and journalist [[Tracey Spicer]] announced on Twitter that she was launching an investigation into reports of sexual harassment by powerful Australian men in the media in the wake of the [[Harvey Weinstein]] sexual abuse allegations and the rise in public awareness of the #MeToo movement. Earlier that same year, Spicer had released a memoir, ''The Good Girl Stripped Bare'', where she wrote about her own experiences of sexual harassment in the work place. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_nz/article/a37znj/tracey-spicer-to-unveil-decades-of-sexual-assault-in-australian-media|title=Tracey Spicer To Unveil Decades of Sexual Assault In Australian Media|date=2017-10-20|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;Spicer later reported that she had received responses from 470 people about people in the industry, including Australian television presenter and producer [[Don Burke]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-27/don-burke-accused-of-sexual-harassment-indecent-assault/9188070|title='He was trying to take my top off': Don Burke accused of sexual harassment|date=2017-11-27|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;The extent of the claims against Burke were published by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and The Sydney Morning Herald in a joint investigative piece on 26 November 2017, where it was reported that "One name kept recurring – Don Burke."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/the-australian-media-industry-operates-a-protection-racket-for-men-like-don-burke-20171127-gztgu3.html|title=The Australian media industry operates a protection racket for men like Don Burke|last=Spicer|first=Tracey|date=2017-11-27|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/a-highgrade-twisted-abuser-don-burke-a-sexual-harasser-and-bully-claims-series-of-women-20171126-gzt6d2.html|title='A high-grade, twisted abuser': Don Burke a sexual harasser and bully, claims series of women|last=McClymont|first=Kate|date=2017-11-26|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;Spicer, along with Kate McClymont, Lorna Knowles and Alison Branley, won the 2018 Walkley Awards in the print/text journalism and Television/Video Current Affairs Short (less than 20 minutes) categories for their investigation and on Australia Day in 2018, Spicer was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia "for significant service to the broadcast media as a journalist and television presenter, and as an ambassador for social welfare and charitable groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.walkleys.com/awards/walkleys/award-winners-2018/|title=Award Winners - The Walkley Foundation|work=The Walkley Foundation|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/26/journalist-tracey-spicer-humbled-by-australia-day-honour|title=Journalist Tracey Spicer 'humbled' by Australia Day honour|last=Davidson|first=Helen|date=2018-01-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year, Spicer and Melinda Schneider launched NOW Australia, a campaign aimed at helping connect people with legal support and counselling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/25/tracey-spicer-launches-now-australia-campaign-as-tina-arena-joins-accusers|title=Tracey Spicer launches Now Australia campaign as Tina Arena joins accusers|last=Harmon|first=Steph|date=2018-03-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then the #MeToo movement has now expanded beyond Australian media and the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] has launched an independent search into workplace sexual harassment that is the first of its kind in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-08-03/how-metoo-australian-media-has-spread-other-industries|title=How #MeToo in the Australian media has spread to other industries|work=Public Radio International|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been hypothesised by ''The Age'' that Australia's strict defamation laws make it difficult for more victims to come forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/facing-the-particular-challenge-of-metoo-in-australia-20171215-h05ctp.html|publisher=The Age|title=Facing the particular challenge of metoo in Australia |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] has been a vocal advocate and supporter of the #MeToo movement. In a speech at the [[World Economic Forum]] in January 2018, Trudeau called for critical discussion on issues brought up by the #MeToo, [[Time's Up (movement)|Time's Up]], and Women's March movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/pm-keynote-remarks-for-world-economic-forum-2018/|title=Justin Trudeau's Davos address in full|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trudeau has also advocated and acted upon a high standard set for himself and members of his government. Trudeau stated that he holds a "zero tolerance for sexual assault, harassment or other forms of misconduct by his employees or caucus colleagues".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/01/17/change-in-canadian-society-on-sexual-harassment-not-fast-enough-trudeau-says.html|title=Change in Canadian society on sexual harassment ‘not fast enough,’ Trudeau says  {{!}} The Star|work=thestar.com|access-date=July 9, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] party, Trudeau initiated investigations on several members of parliament resulting in the dismissal of cabinet minister [[Kent Hehr]], the resignation of MP [[Darshan Kang]], and the suspension and later expulsion of MPs [[Scott Andrews (politician)|Scott Andrews]] and [[Massimo Pacetti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-hehr-sexual-allegations-1.4510371|title=Trudeau says Liberals 'doing the best that we can' amid sexual harassment allegations {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=July 9, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Trudeau explained that the zero tolerance standard applied to himself as well and stated, "I've been very, very careful all my life to be thoughtful, to be respectful of people's space and people's headspace as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-careful-metoo-1.4511093|title=Trudeau says zero tolerance on misconduct toward women applies to him as well {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=July 9, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, an editorial written in August 2000 resurfaced during his premiership regarding an alleged incident where author accused Trudeau of groping a reporter and in July 2018 Trudeau publicly rejected the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/justin-trudeau-denies-groping-reporter-music-festival-2000-british-columbia|title=Justin Trudeau 'does not remember' groping reporter at festival|author=Ashifa Kassam|date=July 2, 2018|access-date=July 3, 2018|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/02/justin-trudeau-responds-to-groping-allegations-i-dont-remember-any-negative-interactions/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.642d2f3b6f85|title=Justin Trudeau responds to groping allegations: 'I don't remember any negative interactions'|author=Rebecca Tan|date=July 2, 2018|access-date=July 3, 2018|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece stated Trudeau provided a "day-late" apology to the reporter, saying, "If I had known you were reporting for a national paper, I never would have been so forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4309277/justin-trudeau-reporter-grope/|title=COMMENTARY: The facts about what Justin Trudeau can't remember|work=Global News|access-date=July 9, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 6 Trudeau stated there was no need to conduct an investigation into the allegations against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cp24.com/news/don-t-investigate-groping-allegation-from-2000-trudeau-says-1.4002639|title=Don't investigate groping allegation from 2000, Trudeau says|first=Chris|last=Herhalt|date=July 6, 2018|website=Cp24.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
On Chinese social networks, hashtags #WoYeShi or #metoo are sometimes used to denote the #Metoo hashtag.

In mainland China, the [[Internet censorship in China|Chinese internet censorship service]] has slowed down the Chinese MeToo posts via censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Javier C.|last1=Hernandez|first2=Zoe|last2=Mou|date=January 23, 2018|title='Me Too,' Chinese Women Say.

An article appearing on the state-run ''[[China Daily]]'' newspaper states that sexual misconduct is rare in China due to superior education and culture has caused considerable Internet outrages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/anger-as-chinese-media-claim-harassment-is-just-a-western-problem|title=Anger as Chinese media claim harassment is just a western problem|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108130241/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/anger-as-chinese-media-claim-harassment-is-just-a-western-problem|archivedate=November 8, 2017|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 8, 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study from a pair of professors from [[City University of Hong Kong]] indicated that about 80% of working women in China have experienced sexual harassment at some point in their career,&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; and there were strong reactions of anger online following the report. The article has since been taken down.&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/25/china-refuses-to-admit-it-has-a-rape-problem-i-would-know/|title=China Refuses to Admit It Has a Rape Problem.

New laws recently made it illegal for television programming to contain images of a women's cleavage, sexual acts outside of marriage, or any topics that present "Western lifestyles" in a positive light. #MeToo has received extreme governmental [[censorship]] online.&lt;ref name=":302" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;

Sophie Richardson, the [[Human Rights Watch]] director for China, stated the Chinese government regularly suppresses discussion of women's rights, for example an incident in 2015 where [[Li Tingting]] and four other activists were arrested when the government learned they planned to hand out stickers about preventing sexual harassment on public transportation.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;

In Hong Kong, track and field athlete Vera Lui Lai-Yiu posted her case of sex abuse alongside #metoo on her Facebook fanpage on her 23rd birthday. She posted in response to a similar action by gymnast [[McKayla Maroney]]. Lui posted a picture of herself holding a piece of paper with the handwritten words "#metoo lly" (her initials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/laiyiului/photos/rpp.1084620708226476/1613101928711682/?type=3&amp;theater|title=我被我的前教練性侵犯|date=November 30, 2017|website=Facebook|language=zh|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206195621/https://www.facebook.com/laiyiului/photos/rpp.1084620708226476/1613101928711682/?type=3&amp;theater|archivedate=December 6, 2017|deadurl=no}}{{Primary source inline|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/realtime/article/20171130/57522123|title=香港體育界驚爆性侵 「欄后」呂麗瑤生日FB勇敢指控前教練|date=November 30, 2017|website=Apple Daily Hong Kong|language=zh|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032439/https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/realtime/article/20171130/57522123|archivedate=December 1, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/hong-kong-athlete-says-coach-abused-her-as-teen/article/508811|title=Hong Kong athlete says coach abused her as teen|date=November 30, 2017|website=Digital Journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041229/http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/hong-kong-athlete-says-coach-abused-her-as-teen/article/508811|archivedate=December 1, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2122203/coach-sexually-assaulted-her-when-she-was-13-hong-kong|title=Police to investigate after Hong Kong hurdler Vera Lui says coach sexually assaulted her when she was 13|date=November 30, 2017|website=South China Morning Post|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130025628/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2122203/coach-sexually-assaulted-her-when-she-was-13-hong-kong|archivedate=November 30, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news.php?id=100313&amp;sid=4|title=Hurdler Vera Lui claims sexual assault by coach in teenage years|date=November 30, 2017|website=the Standard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041033/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news.php?id=100313&amp;sid=4|archivedate=December 1, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, student Zheng Xi publicly started a campaign against sexual harassment in response to #MeToo.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;

Dr. Luo Xixi, an academic, revealed being sexually assaulted by a professor at [[Beihang University]] when she was in her 20s.

The people who signed the letter, especially {{lang|fr|Deneuve|italic=no}} and {{lang|fr|Millet|italic=no}}, were criticized for saying men should have the "right to pester" women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/french-feminists-catherine-deneuve-metoo-letter-sexual-harassment|title=After the #MeToo backlash, an insider's guide to French feminism|last=Poirier|first=Agnès|date=January 14, 2018|website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=January 15, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114235554/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/french-feminists-catherine-deneuve-metoo-letter-sexual-harassment|archivedate=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter also told people not to be bothered by small amounts of sexual harassment, for example men who rub against women on public transportation. The letter states women should "consider it as the expression of a great sexual misery, or even as a nonevent".&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; French politician {{lang|fr|[[Marlène Schiappa]]|italic=no}} said some aspects of the letter were "profoundly shocking" and "we have immense difficulty convincing young women that when a man rubs his genitals against a woman in the [[Paris Métro|Métro]] without her consent, it is an act of sexual assault that can lead to three years in prison and a 75,000 euro fine."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

A week after its publication, {{lang|fr|Deneuve|italic=no}} issued a letter of clarification, and said although she still agrees with the spirit of the original letter, she wants to clarify that she does believe sexual harassment and assault are real problems, and apologized to all victims of unpleasant sexual acts who read the letter and felt hurt by it.&lt;ref name=":36"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/catherine-deneuve-me-too.html|title=Catherine Deneuve Apologizes to Victims after Denouncing #MeToo|last=Codrea-Rado|first=Anna|year=2018|website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=January 15, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115143236/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/catherine-deneuve-me-too.html|archivedate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;{{cite web|last=Deneuve|first=Catherine |author-link=Catherine Deneuve|url=http://www.liberation.fr/debats/2018/01/14/catherine-deneuve-rien-dans-le-texte-ne-pretend-que-le-harcelement-a-du-bon-sans-quoi-je-ne-l-aurais_1622399|title=Catherine Deneuve : "Rien dans le texte ne prétend&amp;nbsp;que le harcèlement a du bon, sans quoi je ne l'aurais pas signé"|website=[[Libération]]|date=January 14, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2018|language=fr|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115191819/http://www.liberation.fr/debats/2018/01/14/catherine-deneuve-rien-dans-le-texte-ne-pretend-que-le-harcelement-a-du-bon-sans-quoi-je-ne-l-aurais_1622399|archivedate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political commentator {{lang|fr|Anastasia Colosimo|italic=no}} said the movement to prevent sexual misconduct at work is more accepted by younger women in France because they take sexual freedom as a given, while older feminists are afraid #MeToo may hurt the sexual revolution.&lt;ref name=":352" /&gt; Legal professional {{lang|fr|Marilyn Baldeck|italic=no}} noted that when people are given "concrete examples" of sexual misconduct, they often "change their minds and acknowledge how harmful some situations can be".&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; French politician {{lang|fr|Sandrine Rousseau|italic=no}} said that the #MeToo movement will continue because French women have been silenced for too long.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; A petition aimed at President {{lang|fr|Emmanuel Macron|italic=no}} demanded sexual harassment to be taken more seriously in France, and received more than 100,000 signatures in 3 days.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

The List of Sexual Harassers in Academia ("[[LoSHA]]") was posted on October 24, 2017 by activist Inji Pennu and an Indian student in California named Raya Sarkar, who alleged they personally confirmed every incident.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/perpetrators-are-shamed-under-due-process-toofarooqui-tejpal-khurshid-were-all-s/303891|title='Perpetrators are shamed under due process too ...

Harimaya writes how the #MeToo movement has shown several women that they are not alone as they feared, and that many women are experiencing the same sexual violence and harassment.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Keiko Kojima of Buzzfeed Japan says that #MeToo is needed in Japan because sexual harassment is baked into Japanese society, and the movement is about the fact that it is okay to say no to sexual violence. She said growing up that she felt getting molested on the train was an unavoidable as mosquito bites in the summer, and she hopes that #MeToo gives more victims the ability to find their voice, including male victims. She says that, despite how it is attacked in Japanese media, that #MeToo is not an "anti-man" campaign, it is simply about anti-violence and anti-harassment. She also believes it is extremely important for men to call out behaviors in others such as sexual harassment or having sex with someone who is unconscious. Therefore, every person who is not committing sexual violence is part of the #MeToo movement, whether they are male or female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jp/keikokojima/metoo-ga-kirai-na-anata|title=#MeToo が嫌いなあなたへ|last=Kojima|first=Keiko|website=BuzzFeed |access-date=January 5, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233606/https://www.buzzfeed.com/jp/keikokojima/metoo-ga-kirai-na-anata|archivedate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shiori Ito notes that the word "rape" is [[taboo]] in Japan, and is typically described with less threatening words such as saying an underage victim was "tricked" or a woman was "violated" to describe what happened, which Ito says contributes to the public not understanding the full extent of the problem.&lt;ref name=":1522" /&gt; The legal age of consent in Japan is 13. She says women in Japan are regularly exposed to harassment from a young age, and recalls being groped by a man at a swimming pool when she was 10 only to be blamed herself for wearing a "cute bikini".

As part of the #MeToo movement, {{ill|Shiori Ito|jp|伊藤詩織}} went public alleging that she was raped by {{ill|Noriyuki Yamaguchi|jp|山口敬之}}, a prominent TV journalist and acquaintance of Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]],&lt;ref name=BBC2018-06-28a&gt;{{cite news |title=Japan's secret shame|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0b8cfcj/japans-secret-shame|date=20 June 2018|accessdate=26 July 2018 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; an admission she says was unthinkable for a woman to do in Japan. Yamaguchi rejects her accusations, and says that sex was consensual.&lt;ref name=BBC2018-06-28a/&gt; She said her experience with Japan's legal system showed her that victims of sex crimes were undermined and ignored. She called for the Japanese parliament to update Japan's laws regarding rape, which were over a century old. She explains how she could not get information on which hospital provides rape kits without going through a preliminary interview in person. When she went to the police, she was discouraged from filing a report, and informed her career would be ruined for no reason if she did this. She was told she did not act like a victim, and had to be interviewed by several officers, including one who made her reenact the rape with a dummy while he took pictures. Although they initially said they would arrest Yamaguchi, the case and charges were unexpectedly dropped. Ito then went to the media, but no one would take her story. When she spoke about the experience at a press conference, she made national news and immediately started receiving a negative backlash, hate mail, and threats.&lt;ref name=":1522" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/22/asia/shiori-ito-japan-metoo-intl/index.html|title=Ignored, humiliated: How Japan is accused of failing survivors of sexual abuse|author1=Anna Stewart|author2=Euan McKirdy|author3=Junko Ogura|website=Edition.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been unsuccessful in her attempts to have criminal charges brought against Yamaguchi, but as of 2018 she was still pursuing a civil case against him, which he was defending.&lt;ref name=BBC2018-06-28a/&gt;

[[Nigerians|Nigerian]] women and children get sexually assaulted every day and do not speak up about it due to fear of [[stigmatisation]] and [[prejudice]].&lt;ref name=":60"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pulse.ng/gist/metro/horror-stories-of-how-these-nigerian-women-were-raped-id8066173.html|title=Horror stories of how these Nigerian women were raped|last=Akinloye|first=Dimeji|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official silence seems to surround [[sexual abuse]] of women in Nigeria, with the police frequently not taking sexual abuse reports seriously.&lt;ref name=":61"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=IZUGBARA|first=C.

==== Role of power and privilege ====
There is a factor of power influencing the slow growth of the movement in Nigeria. The country is a highly patriarchal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://guardian.ng/features/as-metoo-moves-across-the-world-is-nigeria-next/|title=As #MeToo moves across the world, is Nigeria next?|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have complained of how unimaginable it is in the country to report cases of harassment.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-africa-women-sexcrimes/metoo-challenges-taboo-against-admitting-sexual-abuse-in-africa-idUSKBN1CP1CG|title=#MeToo challenges taboo against admitting sexual abuse in Africa|last=Peyton|first=Nellie|work=U.S.|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, sexual harassment is so prominent within the country that it is perceived as almost a right to men.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;

====Brenda Uphopho case====
She had been assaulted three times by three different men. The first incident took place at age five. At that time, she was too young to understand what happened until she turned 18 when she encountered a similar incident again. She was at a party when a stranger forced her to have sex with him. Upon her refusal, he beat her up and raped her. Due to the stigma attached to being raped, she resorted to silence. The final experience took place at her workplace when her boss forcibly put his hand under her skirt. She still remained silent with the notion of not being believed and being judged by others. Realizing she could not remain silent and needed to make an impact, Uphopho currently works with her husband to break the "culture of silence" around abuse in Nigeria. They produced a play called "Shattered" which seeks to encourage victims of sexual abuse to speak up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/02/africa/nigeria-rape-survivors-metoo-asequals/index.html|title=The #MeToo stories you haven't heard: Meet the women speaking out in Nigeria|last=CNN|first=Stephanie Busari and Torera Idowu|work=|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With hashtags such as #BoycottAliZafar, #BoycottTeefainTrouble, and #TeefaisTrouble, a huge wave of activists built a momentum on social media ahead of the movie's premiere and subsequent screenings. A few major Pakistani media outlets outright ignored the demonstrations but other had to give in when protestors turned up at cinemas and police and other law enforcement agencies got involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cutacut.com/2018/07/21/police-detain-protesters-at-ali-zafars-teefa-in-trouble-screening-in-neuplex-karachi/|title=Police detain protesters at Ali Zafar’s Teefa in Trouble screening in Nueplex Karachi|work=cutacut|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestors again showed up at Lahore’s CineStar for voice their anger and disappointment at both the promotion of the film of an alleged harasser and the celebrities pouring in to support him. The controversy deepened when, in one instance, the demonstrators asked Waleed Zaman, the creative director of women’s clothing brand Kayseria, the reason why he was backing the film, to which Zaman responded by saying: “We support sexual harassment of women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/asia/pakistan/we-support-sexual-harassment-pakistani-businessman-1.2254722|title=We support sexual harassment: Pakistani businessman|last=Editor|first=Rabab Khan, Community Interactivity|date=2018-07-21|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/07/22/white-lies-273/|title=White Lies|website=Pakistantoday.com.pk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At yet another screening of the film at Nueplex Cinemas at Rashid Minhas Road, Karachi, protestors were allegedly held in the basement and beaten by the cinema’s private security, with various media reports confirming the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mangobaaz.com/protesters-teefa-in-trouble-beaten-up/|title=Teefa In Trouble Protesters In Karachi Were Allegedly Beaten Up By Rangers And Pakistanis Are Furious|date=2018-07-21|work=MangoBaaz|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/271162/protests-erupt-against-ali-zafars-teefa-in-trouble/|title=Protests erupt against Ali Zafar’s ‘Teefa in Trouble’ - Daily Times|date=2018-07-22|work=Daily Times|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrators’ phones were also confiscated and the cinema's security allegedly tried to plant incriminating evidence in one of the protestors' bags in order to make their case appear stronger to police.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, they were let go later after the arrival of Rangers personnel.

==== Stand-up comedy ====
At least four women leveled allegations of sexual misconduct against Junaid Akram, a prominent stand-up comedian and vlogger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/214445|title=Stand-up comedian Junaid Akram accused of sexual assault, harassment|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the accusers were girls in their teens and early twenties. Akram, too, denied "all allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct", labeled them "false", and announced that he intended to pursue legal actions as he had "already met my legal team".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1181035|title=As #MeToo picks up in Pakistan, Junaid Akram and Faisal Edhi are accused of sexual harassment|last=Staff|first=Images|date=2018-10-11|work=Images|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akram also clarified that his "marital status is public information".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1822859/4-junaid-akram-denies-claims-sexual-harassment/|title=Multiple women accuse Junaid Akram of sexual harassment {{!}} The Express Tribune|date=2018-10-11|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philippines ===
The Me Too movement has slowly picked in in the Philippines. In the culture of the Philippines, shaming and victim blaming are still present. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.devex.com/news/what-metoo-has-meant-around-the-world-93871|title=What #MeToo has meant around the world|date=2018-11-26|work=Devex|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are afraid to say #MeToo because people do not believe them. Stories finally began to come about after actress [[Saab Magalona]] retweeted Alyssa Milano’s infamous quote. &lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asiancorrespondent.com/2018/01/now-filipina-journalists-say-metoo/|title=Now Filipina journalists are saying #MeToo|website=asiancorrespondent.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusations revolved around the entertainment industry as one of the bands, [[Jensen and The Flips|Jensen and the Flips]] was being brought up and they acknowledged their mistakes and apologized for their misconduct.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Statistics from the Philippine Commission on Women from 2004 to 2013 revealed that only 629 cases had been recorded with the Philippine national police’s Women and Children Protection Center.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This figure is believed to only be a fraction of the actual number of harassment offenses committed against women. While the movement has not been as big as in the U.S., other movements such as [[Babae Ako movement|#BabaeAko]] have started as a result of #MeToo. #BabaeAko translates to “I am Women” and began in May after President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] declared that the next Chief Justice of Philippines could not be a woman. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5345552/duterte-philippines-sexism-sona-women/|title=How President Duterte Sparked an Uprising of Filipina Women|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In South Korea, the Me Too movement started to gain momentum as public prosecutor Seo Ji-hyeon shared her experience of assault by a high-level prosecutor and oppression of government authorities on national television on January 29, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shin|first1=Ji-min|last2=Seon|first2=Dahm-eun|title=MeToo movement having lasting impact on South Korean society after just one month|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/834264.html|accessdate=March 1, 2018|work=Hankyoreh|date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of her interview, Seo claimed that she was sexually assaulted by then Korean Ministry of Justice Policy Planning Director and former prosecutor Ahn Tae-geun at a funeral in 2010. She reported the activity to her superiors, however, her superiors covered up the incident and demoted her to Changwon Public Prosecutor's Office from her post in Seoul, in spite the fact that she was highly praised and awarded for her work performance by her superiors prior to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/31/south-korean-public-prosecutor-sparks-countrys-metoo-moment/|title=South Korean public prosecutor sparks country's #Metoo moment with allegations of groping|first=Nicola|last=Smith|date=February 28, 2018|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Seo's public admittance of sexual assault, the Me Too movement spread quickly to other areas of society. On February 13, 2018, several women, including former actress Kim Soo-hee and actress Hong Seon-joo, accused [[Lee Yountaek]], a prominent and critically acclaimed stage director, of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Choe|first=Sang-hun|title=A Director's Apology Adds Momentum to South Korea's #MeToo Movement|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/world/asia/south-korea-metoo-lee-youan-taek.html|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=The New York Times|date=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee allegedly forced many women in his theater troupe, for 18 years, to massage his genital area prior to raping them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Park|first1=Jin-hai|title=#MeToo is another 'candlelight protest'|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/culture/2018/02/703_244739.html|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=Korea Times|date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Kim Soo-hee stated that in 2005, Lee raped her and got her pregnant, for which she had an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kil|first1=Sonia|title=Korean Stage Director Lee Yoon-taek Accused of Rape|url=https://variety.com/2018/legit/asia/korea-metoo-stage-director-lee-yoon-taek-accused-of-rape-1202707408/|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=Variety|date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, actress Hong Seon-joo alleged that Lee forcibly penetrated her private part with sticks and wooden chopsticks, saying it will help her vocalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chun|first=Geum-joo|title=[영상] "성기에 나무젓가락 꽂아…" 손석희도 놀란 홍선주의 폭로|url=http://news.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=0012147853&amp;code=61121211|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=Kukmin Ilbo|date=February 22, 2018|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Lee resigned from all his positions in the theater world and formally apologized to the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theater director Lee apologizes amid sex assault allegations|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/03/251_245760.html|accessdate=May 26, 2018|work=The Korea Times|date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Park|first=Jin-hai|title=#MeToo is another 'candlelight protest'|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/culture/2018/02/703_244739.html|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=Korea Times|date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee admitted to all his crimes except the abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yoon|first=So-yeon|title=Theater bigwig Lee Youn-taek apologizes for sexual abuse|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3044676|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2018, [[Ko Un]], one of South Korea's most iconic and prominent poets and frequently mentioned [[Nobel laureate]] shortlist candidate, was also accused of sexual assault. First reported by the [[Dong-A Ilbo]], poet [[Choi Young-mi]]'s poem 'The Beast' suggests sexual assault by Ko approximately 20 years ago.

As a result, Ko was pulled from textbooks and critically denounced by fellow literaries alike. Ko also resigned from various posts that he held, including his professorship at [[KAIST]]. On March 2, 2018 Ko offered his statement to [[The Guardian]] through UK publishers Bloodaxe Books, writing that "he had ‘done nothing which might bring shame on my wife or myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=Poet Ko Un erased from Korean textbooks after sexual harassment claims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/02/ko-un-korea-sexual-harassment-claims|work=The Guardian|language=en|date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the denial, more allegations are emerging against Ko.

Gender studies scholar {{lang|sv|[[Eva Lundgren]]|italic=no}} and legal scholar {{lang|sv|Jenny Westerstrand|italic=no}} wrote that the Swedish journalistic profession bore a large part of the blame in Sweden for the problems the Me Too debate had highlighted because Swedish journalists had systematically attacked critical discussion of and research on men's [[violence against women]] for over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.svd.se/journalistkaren-har-fortigit-mans-vald-mot-kvinnor Journalistkåren har förtigit mäns våld mot kvinnor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127083952/https://www.svd.se/journalistkaren-har-fortigit-mans-vald-mot-kvinnor |date=January 27, 2018 }}, ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Ellinor Skagegård in the Swedish newspaper {{lang|sv|[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|italic=yes}} wrote that during the Me Too campaign, it looks as if Lundgren was right in her research on men's violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.svd.se/hennes-forskning-hanades--metoo-kan-ge-upprattelse Hennes forskning hånades – #metoo kan ge upprättelse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127083823/https://www.svd.se/hennes-forskning-hanades--metoo-kan-ge-upprattelse |date=January 27, 2018 }}, ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of allegations concerning the involvement of British politicians in cases of [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault|assault]] arose in October and November 2017, the [[2017 Westminster sexual scandals]]. Allegations were prompted by discussions among junior staff employed in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] at Westminster following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]] in Hollywood earlier in October, and the subsequent rise of Me Too. The journalists [[Jane Merrick]] and Kate Maltby made allegations against the Defence Minister [[Michael Fallon]] and de facto Deputy Prime Minister [[Damian Green]], respectively. These led to the departures of both from Theresa May's cabinet, the latter after a two-month inquiry that also considered allegations that Green had lied about copious amounts of pornography found on his parliamentary computer. Both Merrick and Maltby cited the #MeToo movement as inspiring their allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/01/britains-metoo-movement-is-uncovering-a-culture-of-rampant-sexism-and-harassment-in-londons-corridors-of-power.html|title=That Charity Dinner Was Just the Tip of the Iceberg of the British Elite's Culture of Sexism and Harassment|first=Julia|last=Rampen|website=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative energy''' is a concept used in [[physics]] to explain the nature of certain [[field (physics)|fields]], including the [[gravitational field]] and various [[quantum field]] effects.

In more speculative theories, negative energy is involved in [[wormhole]]s which may allow for [[time travel]] and [[warp drive]]s for faster-than-light space travel.

==Gravitational energy==
{{Main|Gravitational energy}}
The strength of the gravitational attraction between two objects represents the amount of [[gravitational energy]] in the field which attracts them towards each other. When they are infinitely far apart, the gravitational attraction and hence energy approach zero. As two such massive objects move towards each other, the motion accelerates under [[gravity]] causing an increase in the positive kinetic energy of the system. At the same time, the gravitational attraction - and hence energy - also increase in magnitude, but the [[law of energy conservation]] requires that the net energy of the system not change. This issue can only be resolved if the change in gravitational energy is negative, thus cancelling out the positive change in kinetic energy. Since the gravitational energy is getting stronger, this decrease can only mean that it is negative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]]'' The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins'' (1997), Random House, {{ISBN|0-224-04448-6}} Appendix A: ''Gravitational Energy'' demonstrates the negativity of gravitational energy.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[universe]] in which positive energy dominates will eventually collapse in a "[[big crunch]]", while an "open" universe in which negative energy dominates will either expand indefinitely or eventually disintegrate in a "[[big rip]]". In the [[zero-energy universe]] model ("flat" or "Euclidean"), the total amount of energy in the universe is exactly [[zero]]: its amount of positive energy in the form of [[matter]] is exactly cancelled out by its negative energy in the form of [[gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; ''The Grand Design'', 2010, Page 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum field effects==
Negative energies and negative energy density are consistent with [[quantum field theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everett |first=Allen |author2=Roman, Thomas |title=Time Travel and Warp Drives |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2012 |page=167 |isbn=0-226-22498-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual particles===
{{Main|Virtual particles}}
In quantum theory, the [[uncertainty principle]] allows the vacuum of space to be filled with [[virtual particles|virtual]] particle-antiparticle pairs which appear spontaneously and exist for only a short time before, typically, annihilating themselves again. Some of these virtual particles can have negative energy. Their behaviour plays a role in several important phenomena, as described below.

===Casimir effect===
{{Main|Casimir effect}}
In the Casimir effect, two flat plates placed very close together restrict the wavelengths of quanta which can exist between them. This in turn restricts the types and hence number and density of [[virtual particle]] pairs which can form in the intervening vacuum and can result in a negative energy density. This causes an attractive force between the plates, which has been measured.&lt;ref name="fordroman"&gt;Ford and Roman 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hawking radiation===
{{Main|Hawking radiation}}
[[Virtual particles]] with negative energy can exist for a short period. This phenomenon is a part of the mechanism involved in [[Hawking radiation]] by which [[black hole]]s evaporate.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; ''A Brief History of Time'', Bantam 1988, Pages 105-107. {{ISBN|0-593-01518-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Squeezed light===
{{Main|Squeezed light}}
It is possible to arrange multiple beams of laser light such that destructive [[quantum interference]] suppresses the [[vacuum fluctuations]]. Such a squeezed vacuum state involves negative energy. The repetitive waveform of light leads to alternating regions of positive and negative energy.&lt;ref name="fordroman" /&gt;

===Dirac sea===
{{Main|Dirac sea}}
According to the theory of the [[Dirac sea]], developed by [[Paul Dirac]] in 1930, the [[vacuum]] of space is full of negative energy. This theory was developed to explain the anomaly of negative-energy [[quantum states]] predicted by the [[Dirac equation]].

The Dirac sea theory correctly predicted the existence of [[antimatter]] two years prior to the discovery of the [[positron]] in 1932 by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]]. However, the Dirac sea theory treats antimatter as a hole where there is the absence of a particle rather than as a real particle. [[Quantum field theory]] (QFT), developed in the 1930s, deals with antimatter in a way that treats antimatter as made of real particles rather than the absence of particles, and treats a vacuum as being empty of particles rather than full of negative-energy particles like in the Dirac sea theory.

Quantum field theory has displaced the Dirac sea theory as a more popular explanation of these aspects of physics. Both the Dirac sea theory and quantum field theory are equivalent by means of a [[Bogoliubov transformation]], so the Dirac sea can be viewed as an alternative formulation of quantum field theory, and is thus consistent with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=López de Recalde|first=Andrea|date=2017|title=The Standard Electro-Weak Theory, 2nd Edition|url=https://books.google.at/books?id=mNevDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=dirac+sea+equivalent+transformation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dirac%20sea%20equivalent%20transformation&amp;f=false|location=Morrisville, North Carolina|publisher=LuLu Press, Inc.|page=65|isbn=978-1-365-65887-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculative suggestions==
===Wormholes===
{{Main|Wormhole}}
Negative energy appears in the speculative theory of [[wormhole]]s, where it is needed to keep the wormhole open. A wormhole directly connects two locations which may be separated arbitrarily far apart in both space and time, and in principle allows near-instantaneous travel between them.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; "[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1269288/STEPHEN-HAWKING-How-build-time-machine.html How to build a time machine]", ''Mail Online'' 27 April 2010(retrieved 4 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warp drive===
{{Main|Warp drive}}
A theoretical principle for a [[faster-than-light]] (FTL) warp drive for spaceships has been suggested, involving negative energy. The [[Alcubierre drive]] comprises a solution to Einstein's equations of [[general relativity]], in which a bubble of spacetime is moved rapidly by expanding space behind it and shrinking space in front of it.&lt;ref name="fordroman" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4189">{{hatnote|Pinching is a [[Multi-touch#Multi-touch gestures|multi-touch]] gesture, done by squeezing one's fingers on a [[touchscreen]].}}

A '''pinch''' is a grip of a flexible object in which a portion is taken between two [[finger]]s, until it hurts, or something of resemblance and squeezed so the gripped portion of the object is lifted from its normal level. By extension, that which is taken in the grip is referred to as a "pinch."

When the fingers are used to perform a pinch, the action usually consists of the [[thumb]] and one other finger. The closer to the thumb the other finger is located, the stronger the pinch.

==Pinch of the skin==
The term "pinch" often refers to the action being taken on the [[skin]]. A pinch of the skin displaces the skin and [[blood]] beneath from its natural position, and may inflict a minor degree of pain, which may increase if the amount of skin being pinched is smaller, but is usually tolerable to most.

Pinching the skin can result in [[pinch mark]]s, a [[List of cutaneous conditions|cutaneous condition]], and when on the ears or in the genital region of male children may be suggestive of child abuse.&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P. |author2=Bolognia, Jean L. |author3=Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical uses===
[[File:Penile nerve block dorsal.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The skin is being pinched while an injection is being given]]
Pinching has the following uses in health care and medicine:
*The skin is often pinched prior to giving an [[injection (medicine)|injection]] in order to get the needle in the desired location.
*In [[neurology]], pinching can be used to determine pain sensitivity for a certain area of skin. 
*Can be used to determine [[Resilience (materials science)|resiliency]] in the skin of an [[old age|aged person]]. When the skin is pinched, the amount of time the pinch remains visible following the pinch is an indicator.&lt;ref&gt;Physical dimensions of aging By Waneen Wyrick Spirduso, Karen L. Francis, Priscilla G. MacRae: Page 83&lt;/ref&gt; 
*When skin has been [[sunburn|damaged by the sun]], pinching can be used to determine the amount of damage. Examining the appearance with varying amounts of time following the pinch can be used to determine the amount of damage.&lt;ref&gt;Photodamaged skin: clinical signs, causes and management By Jean-Paul Ortonne, Ronald Marks: Page 19&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In determining [[dehydration]], pinching the skin can serve as a test. The speed at which the pinch turns back can help determine the level of dehydration. The slower it goes back, the more severe the dehydration.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook IMCI: integrated management of childhood illness By World Health Organization. Dept. of Child and Adolescent Health and Development: Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Body fat percentage]] can be determined the [[skinfold test]], in which a pinch of skin is precisely measured by calipers at several standardized points on the body to determine the subcutaneous fat layer thickness. These measurements are converted to an estimated body fat percentage by an equation.
*Pinching is used as part of the diagnosis of [[schleroderma]]. In schleroderma patients, the skin between the fingers becomes too difficult to pinch.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of the musculoskeletal examination By Gerald F. Moore, Gerald Moore: Page 46&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[veterinary medicine]], small amounts of animal skin is pinched in order to perform [[Medical grafting|grafting]].&lt;ref&gt;Techniques in large animal surgery By Anthony Simon Turner, C. Wayne McIlwraith, Bruce L. Hull: Page 129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pinch of powder==
A pinch can refer to the taking of a small amount of a [[powder (substance)|powdery substance]].

In cooking, a "[[Pinch (cooking)|pinch]]" refers to a small amount of an ingredient, such as [[table salt|salt]] or a [[spice]], being taken to be placed within a recipe.

Small amounts of [[street drug]]s are sometimes referred to as a "pinch."

Early efforts at police reform often involved external commissions, such as the [[Wickersham Commission]], that spelled out reforms but left implementation to the police, often with limited success.&lt;ref name="rumbaut-1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bittner|first2=Egon|last-author-amp=yes|date=1979|title=Changing Conceptions of the Police Role: A Sociological Review|journal=Crime and Justice: A Review of Research|volume=1|pages=239–288|doi=10.1086/449063|jstor=1147453|last1=Rumbaut|first1=Rubén G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s: the Johnson Administration and the Warren Court==
In the 1960s, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] created the [[President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice]]. The Commission's final report, issued in 1967,&lt;ref name="McGarrell1988"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZCtPhhx944C&amp;pg=PA8|title=Juvenile Correctional Reform: Two Decades of Policy and Procedural Change|last=McGarrell|first=Edmund F.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1988|isbn=978-1-4384-1243-6|page=8|via=Google Books|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been described as "the most comprehensive evaluation of crime and crime control in the United States at the time".&lt;ref name="GreeneGabbidon2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6gT7dL11OsC|title=Encyclopedia of Race and Crime|last2=Gabbidon|first2=Shaun L.|date=April 14, 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-5085-5|last-author-amp=yes|via=Google Books|first1=Helen Taylor|last1=Greene|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It laid out reorganization plans for [[police department]]s&lt;ref name="DempseyForst2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmUwsHp8m1wC&amp;pg=PA80|title=An Introduction to Policing|last2=Forst|first2=Linda S.|date=January 1, 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-13772-4|page=80|last-author-amp=yes|via=Google Books|first1=John S.|last1=Dempsey|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested a range of reforms.&lt;ref name="Giles2002"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hq3Wy-DkXI4C&amp;pg=PA35|title=Law Enforcement, Communication and Community|last=Giles|first=Howard|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=2002|isbn=978-1-58811-255-2|page=35|via=Google Books|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of the Commission's findings related to the poor treatment of juvenile offenders.&lt;ref name="HessDrowns2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fM-klUeEqEQC&amp;pg=PA49|title=Juvenile Justice|last2=Drowns|first2=Robert W.|date=June 26, 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-50437-5|pages=49–|last-author-amp=yes|via=Google Books|first1=Kären M.|last1=Hess|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decisions under the [[Warren Court]] led to important changes in policing, with respect to [[civil right]]s and [[constitutional law]].  ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'' in 1961 and ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' in 1966 were two highly influential court decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New World of Police Accountability |last=Walker |first= Samuel |date=2005 |publisher=Sage |page= 29 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mapp v. Ohio'' found that evidence obtained in violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] protection against "unreasonable searches and seizures" may not be used in criminal prosecutions.  ''Miranda v. Arizona'' required that criminal suspects must be informed of their right to consult with an attorney and of their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]  right against self-incrimination prior to questioning by police.  These decisions began to set national standards for policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walker|2005|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s and 1980s==
Special commissions, such as the [[Knapp Commission]] in [[New York City]] during the 1970s, have been used to bring about changes in law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walker|2005|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Civilian review boards (permanent external oversight agencies) have also been used as a means for improving police accountability.  Civilian review boards tend to focus on individual complaints, rather than broader organizational issues that may result in long-term improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walker|2005|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990 to 2010==
The 1994 [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] authorized the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Civil Rights Division]] to bring [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] ("pattern or practice") suits against local law enforcement agencies, to rein in abuses and hold agencies accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/faq.htm#pppmp.htm |title=Department of Justice Police Misconduct Pattern or Practice Program (FAQ) |publisher=United States Department of Justice |accessdate=November 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, numerous departments have entered into [[consent decree]]s or [[memorandum of understanding|memoranda of understanding]], requiring the agencies to make organizational reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walker|2005|p= 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach shifts focus from individual officers to police organizations.

The Department of Justice also has a component called the Community Relations Service. Over the years, the Community Relations Service (CRS) has helped police departments and communities all over the country come to grips with the difficult task of maintaining law and order in a complex and changing multicultural society. Frequently, these efforts have involved minority citizens' complaints about police behavior, use of force, and hate groups.

To reduce the potential for violence, police executives must inculcate the values articulated by policy and procedure into two levels of the police department: the administrative level and the "line" or operational level. To accomplish the task of value-transition on one level without doing so on the other is futile, for no change in police behavior will result. In addition to the two levels of the organization which the police executive must address, two ''dimensions'' of law enforcement must also be addressed: the police culture and various community cultures. Thus, to effect change in police-community violence, police executives must take a multidimensional approach. Traditional approaches to reform have been one-dimensional, and have met with little success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.justice.gov/archive/crs/pubs/principlesofgoodpolicingfinal092003.htm|title = Principles of Good Policing: Avoiding Violence Between Police and Citizens |website = www.justice.gov|access-date = 2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 to present==
Some law enforcement agencies in the United States in the early 2000s and 2010s began to emphasize [[de-escalation]] as a method of [[conflict resolution]] and obtaining voluntary compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Federal judge approves key step in SPD reforms|url = http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/federal-judge-approves-key-step-in-spd-reforms/|accessdate = 2015-04-17|website = |publisher = Seattle Times|last = Miletich|first = Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Police training turning warriors into guardians|url = http://www.yakimaherald.com/photosandvideos/statephotos/1299430-8/police-training-turning-warriors-into-guardians|accessdate = 2015-04-17|website = Yakima Herald Republic|last = Miletich|first = Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also emphases on [[community policing]] to build relationships and community trust in law enforcement; the [[evidence-based policing]] approach of using of data to assist with decision-making; and the importance of civilian oversight of police work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://nij.gov/journals/269/Pages/evidence.aspx|title = Being Smart on Crime With Evidence-based Policing|last = Bueermann|first = Jim|date = March 26, 2012|journal = Being Smart on Crime With Evidence-based Policing|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Issues in Policing|last=Cordner|first=G.W.|publisher=Waveland Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=432–449|chapter=Community Policing Elements and Effects}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=111&amp;issue_id=102003|title = Citizen Oversight of Law Enforcement:Challenge and Opportunity|date = October 2003|accessdate = |website = The Police Chief|publisher = The International Association of Chiefs of Police|last = Farrow|first = Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police use of force and issues of race===

In the 2010s, a series of shootings of unarmed individuals by police officers correlated with calls for police and law enforcement reform, especially regarding the diversity of police officers and the treatment of minorities by the criminal justice system.

In the specific case of the [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in Ferguson in August 2014, an investigation by the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division]] concluded that, while there were not sufficient grounds to charge the police officer who shot Brown with a criminal offense, the Ferguson Police Department as a whole "was routinely violating the constitutional rights of its black residents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apuzzo|first1= Matt |date= March 3, 2015 |title=Ferguson Police Routinely Violate Rights of Blacks, Justice Dept.

President [[Barack Obama]] created the [[President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/policingtaskforce|title = President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing|date = |accessdate = |website = www.cops.doj.gov|publisher = United States Department of Justice Community Oriented Policing Services|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission issued a report on March 2, 2015, that made numerous recommendations.

[[Sue Rahr]], when she was sheriff of [[King County]], had introduced a new policing model called L.E.E.D. (Listen and Explain with Equity and Dignity) in 2011, which influenced her later work on the "guardian model" of training police candidates when she became the executive director of the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission; Obama appointed Rahr to the President's Task Force, where the "guardian model" received support as a desirable alternative to the "warrior model" of training officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Police Academy 2.0: Less military training, more empathy|url = http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/police-academy-20-less-military-training-more-empathy/|accessdate = 2015-05-27|date = July 13, 2013|publisher = The Seattle Times|last = Miletich|first = Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Police: From Warriors to Guardians|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-wallis/police-from-warriors-to-g_b_6816726.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-05-27|last = Wallis|first = Jim|date = March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/columns/the-platform/editorial-the-hammer-of-justice-falls-on-ferguson/article_72140bc3-9761-5385-a586-5e814bba8b11.html|title = Editorial: The hammer of Justice falls on Ferguson|date = March 4, 2015|accessdate = May 26, 2015|website = |publisher = St. Louis Post-Dispatch|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Four Pillars of Justice Based Policing: Listen and Explain with Equity and Dignity|url = https://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?a=368336&amp;c=56523|website = www.portlandonline.com|accessdate = 2015-05-27|date = |last = Rahr|first = Sue|last2 = Diaz|first2 = John|last3 = Hawe|first3 = Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rahr said in a U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee hearing that, "When I talk about a guardian mindset... this is not a more kind and gentle way of doing the job. It's the opposite. We have increased firearms training and defensive tactics training, because we want to create strong, effective police officers who have the confidence that they don't [need] to behave in an intimidating manner. When someone has confidence, that helps deescalate as well. I think that when we were too focused on the boot camp method of training, it detracted away from our ability to train officers to be [[critical thinking|critical thinkers]]... What we have tried to shift towards is [[officer training]], where you focus on critical thinking and confidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policing Strategies|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?326139-1/hearing-community-policing|website=c-span.org|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesperson for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] said that the ideas in the report of the President's Commission "will significantly improve the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve" and that "For us to see meaningful change, local authorities must first implement data collection systems to improve transparency, use of force policies that emphasize de-escalation, eradicate all forms of biased policing, and improve community engagement and oversight to provide accountability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bacon|first1=Perry, Jr.|date= March 2, 2015 |title=Obama Police Commission Sidesteps Most Controversial Reforms|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/obama-police-commission-sidesteps-most-controversial-reforms-n315801|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[2015 Baltimore protests]], President [[Barack Obama]] said that "It's in [the interest of police officers] to root out [police] who aren't doing the right thing, to hold accountable people when they do something wrong, instead of just the closing-ranks approach that all too often we see that ends up just feeding greater frustration and ultimately, I think, putting more police officers in danger." Obama also said, "Unfortunately we've seen these police-related killings or deaths too often now, and obviously everybody is starting to recognize that this is not just an isolated incident in Ferguson or New York, but we've got some broader issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pickler|first1=Nedra|title=Obama: police must hold officers accountable for wrongdoing|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/obama-police-must-hold-officers-accountable-for-wrongdoing/|website=seattletimes.com|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police leaders responded on January 29, 2016, with "Use of Force: Taking Policing to a Higher Standard" (http://www.policeforum.org/assets/30%20guiding%20principles.pdf). According to ''The New York Times'', the new guideline call for police to use higher standards for use of force than those set by the U.S. Supreme Court (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/nyregion/police-leaders-unveil-principles-intended-to-shift-policing-practices-nationwide.html?_r=0). "This is a defining moment for us in policing," said Charles Ramsey, the recently-retired commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department, according to The Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/01/29/police-chiefs-consider-dramatic-reforms-to-officer-tactics-training-to-prevent-so-many-shootings/).

On July 7, 2016, after police shootings of black individuals in [[Shooting of Philando Castile|St Paul, Minnesota]] and [[Shooting of Alton Sterling|Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], Obama said that "When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if it's because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same... This is not just a black issue, not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we all should care about." That same day, at a protest in [[Dallas, Texas]], an attacker [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|shot and killed multiple officers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dallas protest: Three police officers dead in sniper shooting|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36742835|website=BBC News|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fernandez|first1=Manny|last2=Furber|first2=Matt|last3=Perez-Penajuly|first3=Richard|title=11 Officers Shot, 4 Fatally, During Dallas Protest of Police Shootings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/us/philando-castile-falcon-heights-shooting.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|multiple officers were shot and killed in Baton Rouge]] amid tensions after the shooting of Alton Sterling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bloom|first1=Julie|last2=McPhate|first2=Mike|title=Three Police Officers Killed and Several Wounded in Baton Rouge Shooting|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/us/baton-rouge-shooting.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama and Black Lives Matter leaders condemned the violence. Obama said, "We may not yet know the motives for this attack, but I want to be clear: there is no justification for violence against law enforcement. None. These attacks are the work of cowards who speak for no one. They right no wrongs. They advance no causes. The officers in Baton Rouge; the officers in Dallas – they were our fellow Americans, part of our community, part of our country, with people who loved and needed them, and who need us now – all of us – to be at our best."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Live Updates: Baton Rouge Police Officers Shot|url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/police-shooting-in-baton-rouge/black-lives-matter-leader-calls-for-peace/|website=The New York Times|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police use of force on mentally ill individuals===
Another dimension of police work receiving scrutiny in the 2010s is the interactions between police officers and individuals with mental illness. "Twenty-five percent or more of people fatally shot by the police have had a mental disorder, according to various analyses." Experts in criminal justice say that funding for mental health services in many parts of the country is insufficient, so police are likely to encounter mentally ill people. In response to negative reactions from the public to high-profile violent interactions between police and mentally ill individuals, some police departments are increasing their specialized training and changing their tactics for their interactions with mentally ill people. For example, all officers in Portland, Oregon receive 40 hours of "crisis intervention training". Officers in some departments may specialize in this type of work, similar to how other officers specialize in SWAT, narcotics, or K-9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goode|first1=Erica|title=For Police, a Playbook for Conflicts Involving Mental Illness|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/health/police-mental-illness-crisis-intervention.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=April 25, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gunter|first1=Joel|title=Are US police too quick to shoot knife-wielding suspects?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41314562|accessdate=September 20, 2017|work=BBC News, Washington DC|date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform of law enforcement agencies with other forms of misconduct===

====Oakland, California Police Department====
The [[Oakland Police Department|Oakland, California Police Department]] had three police chiefs in nine days amid revelations that some Oakland officers had shared inappropriate text messages and emails, that a police sergeant allowed his girlfriend to write his reports, and that there had been sexual misconduct among officers of multiple law enforcement agencies and at least one [[U.S. Department of Defense]] employee. [[Oakland, California|Oakland's]] mayor, Libby Schaaf, said at a news conference, "I am here to run a police department, not a frat house," and that she wants "to root out what is clearly a toxic, macho culture." Peter Keane, a former [[San Francisco]] police commissioner and law professor at [[Golden Gate University]], said, "I think she can find someone who is really ruthless about instituting reforms of these kinds of things" but "You can't do any of this stuff with an internal candidate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matier|first1=Phil|last2=Swan|first2=Rachel|last3=Ross|first3=Andy|title=Oakland police bombshells: Racist texts, latest chief steps down|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Latest-Oakland-police-chief-is-out-after-two-days-8310286.php|website=sfgate.com|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Los Angeles County Jails and Sheriff's Department====
On June 27, 2016, a federal judge sentenced Paul Tanaka, a former second-in-command of the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], to five years in prison. The Court found him guilty of conspiracy and of obstructing an [[FBI]] investigation of abuses at the [[Los Angeles County Jails|county jails]]. Judge [[Percy Anderson (judge)|Percy Anderson]] said, "Not only did (Tanaka) fail to identify and address problems in the jails, he exacerbated them." The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that "Prosecutors accused him of overseeing a scheme in which underlings tried to intimidate the lead FBI agent on the inquiry, concealed the whereabouts of an inmate who was working as a federal informant and pressured deputies not to cooperate with the investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rubin|first1=Joel|title=Former top L.A.

===Firings and resignations of police chiefs===
Police chiefs of Chicago, San Francisco, Baltimore, and Oakland were fired or resigned in 2015 and 2016 after various controversies, often involving issues of race and allegations of use of excessive force by officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Mark|last2=Guarino|first2=Mark|title=Chicago police superintendent fired by mayor amid outcry over video of shooting|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/12/01/chicago-police-superintendent-fired|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glover|first1=Scott|last2=Simon|first2=Dan|title=Embattled San Francisco police chief resigns after shooting|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/19/us/san-francisco-police-chief-resigns/index.html|website=cnn.com|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's chief was fired after a judge ordered the city to make a video public that showed the [[Shooting of Laquan McDonald|shooting of an individual by a police officer]], and after public criticism of the city's handling of the video.

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said, "We did community policing before anybody, we had de-escalation training before anyone. We had this year the lowest number of police involved shootings than any major city in the country, and so it's very ironic that our police were protecting those that were exercising their freedom of speech and they lost their lives doing their jobs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Song|first1=Jean|title=Dallas police praised for community outreach efforts|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dallas-shooting-police-ambush-department-praised-community-outreach/|website=www.cbsnews.com|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police Chief David Brown received widespread praise for his leadership in the aftermath of the shooting of his officers, although in the past he has faced criticism for the low pay of Dallas officers compared to neighboring jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heinz|first1=Frank|title=Dallas Chief of Police David Brown Announces Retirement|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Dallas-Chief-of-Police-David-Brown-Announces-Retirement-392046861.html|website=www.nbcdfw.com|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown addressed protestors in a speech, saying "Become a part of the solution.

{{short description|The use of the aesthetic feminism to promote organisations}}
{{pov|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Womanpower_logo.jpg|alt=feminist symbol|thumb|150px|[[Political colour#Purple|Purple]] has historically represented feminism.]]

'''Purplewashing''' is a [[compound word]] modelled on the term ''[[whitewash]]''. In the context of [[feminism]], it is used to describe a variety of [[Politics|political]] and [[marketing]] strategies aimed at promoting countries, people, companies and other organisations through an appeal to [[gender equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/cultura/2016-04-03/del-pornoburka-al-purplewashing-los-trucos-mas-sucios-contra-el-feminismo_1170764/|title=Del pornoburka al purplewashing, los trucos más sucios contra el feminismo|last=|first=|date=|work=El Confidencial|access-date=|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centredelas.org/images/INFORMES_i_altres_PDF/informe30_eng.pdf|title=Gender and Military Culture|last=|first=|date=|website=Centre Delás|format=pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is commonly used to denounce the use of feminism to justify what is perceived as [[xenophobic]] or [[Islamophobia|Islamophobic]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/world/europe/14burqa.html|title=Parliament Moves France Closer to a Ban on Facial Veils|last=|first=|date=|work=the New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pikaramagazine.com/2014/12/velo-integral-el-feminismo-como-exclusion/|title=Burkas en el ojo ajeno: el feminismo como exclusión|last=|first=|date=|work=Pikara Magazine|access-date=|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eldiario.es/zonacritica/burkini-barbijaputa-purple_washing_6_553004709.html|title='Purple washing' o acordarse del feminismo cuando interesa|last=|first=|date=|work=eldiario|access-date=|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pikaramagazine.com/2014/12/velo-integral-el-feminismo-como-exclusion/|title=Burkas en el ojo ajeno: el feminismo como exclusión|last=|first=|date=|work=Pikara Magazine|access-date=|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is also used to criticise how [[Western countries]], that have not achieved complete gender equality, justify this by pointing out that other countries (often majority [[muslim]]) or cultures still have a worse [[quality of life]] for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/sarah-irving/australian-labor-party-spins-israels-occupation-feminist|title=Australian Labor Party spins Israel’s occupation as feminist|last=|first=|date=|work=Electronic Intfada|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], '''relation construction''' and '''relational constructibility''' have to do with the ways that one [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] is determined by an [[indexed family]] or a [[sequence]] of other relations, called the ''relation dataset''.  The relation in the focus of consideration is called the ''faciendum''.  The relation dataset typically consists of a specified relation over sets of relations, called the ''constructor'', the ''factor'', or the ''method of construction'', plus a specified set of other relations, called the ''faciens'', the ''ingredients'', or the ''makings''.

[[Relation composition]] and [[relation reduction]] are special cases of relation constructions.

== History ==
RepRap was founded in 2005 by Dr [[Adrian Bowyer]], a Senior Lecturer in [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Bath]] in England. Funding was obtained from the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]].

On 13 September 2006, the RepRap 0.2 prototype successfully printed the first part of itself, which were subsequently used to replace an identical part originally created by a commercial 3D printer. On 9 February 2008, RepRap 1.0 "Darwin" successfully made at least one instance of over half its total rapid-prototyped parts. On 14 April 2008, possibly the first end-user item is made by a RepRap: a clamp to hold an [[iPod]] securely to the dashboard of a [[Ford Fiesta]]. By September of that year it was reported that at least 100 copies have been produced in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Power |url=http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2008/09/mechanical_generation.php |title=Mechanical Generation § |publisher=Seedmagazine |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2010-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In April 2009 electronic circuit boards were produced automatically with a RepRap, using an automated control system and a swappable head system capable of printing both plastic and conductive solder. On 2 October 2009, the second generation design, called "Mendel", printed its first part. The Mendel's shape resembles a [[triangular prism]] rather than a cube. RepRap 2.0 "Mendel" was completed in October 2009. On 27 January 2010, the [[Foresight Institute]] announced the "Kartik M. Gada Humanitarian Innovation Prize" for the design and construction of an improved RepRap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gada Prizes|url=http://humanityplus.org/projects/gadaprize/|publisher=humanity+|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third generation design, "Huxley", was officially named on 31 August 2010. Development is based on a miniaturized version of the Mendel hardware with 30% of the original print volume.
Within two years, RepRap and [[#Construction|RepStrap]] building and usage were widespread within the tech, gadget, and engineering communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ingeniøren | url=http://ing.dk/tema/3d-print| publisher= Ingeniøren media | date=2012-09-26 |accessdate=2012-09-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the first successful Delta design, Rostock, had a radically different design.  The latest iterations used [[OpenBeam]]s, wires (typically Dyneema or Spectra fishing lines) instead of belts, and so forth, which also represented some of the latest trends in RepRaps.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In early January 2016 RepRapPro (short for "RepRap Professional", and one commercial arm of the RepRap project in the UK) announced that they are to cease trading on 15 January 2016. The reason given was congestion of the market for low-cost 3D printers and the inability to expand in that market. RepRapPro China continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reprappro.com |title=RepRap Professional Ltd. is now closed. |date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the project was designed by Dr Bowyer to encourage evolution, many variations have been created.&lt;ref name="RepRap Family Tree"&gt;[http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap_Family_Tree RepRap Family Tree]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chulilla | first1 = J.

== Software ==
[[File:Adrian Bowyer - PopTech 2007.webm|thumb|Adrian Bowyer talking about the RepRap Project at [[Poptech]] 2007]]RepRap has been conceived as a complete replication system rather than simply a piece of hardware. To this end the system includes [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) in the form of a [[3D modeling]] system and [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) software and drivers that convert RepRap users' designs into a set of instructions to the RepRap hardware that turns them into physical objects.

Initially two different CAM toolchains had been developed for the RepRap. The first, simply titled "RepRap Host", was written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] by lead RepRap developer Adrian Bowyer. The second, "Skeinforge",&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120711231626/http://fabmetheus.crsndoo.com/wiki/index.php/Skeinforge Skeinforge]&lt;/ref&gt; was written independently by Enrique Perez. Both are complete systems for translating 3D computer models into [[G-code]], the machine language that commands the printer.

Later, other programs like [[slic3r]], [[pronterface]],&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/kliment/Printrun&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cura (software)|Cura]],&lt;ref&gt;https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software&lt;/ref&gt;  were created. Recently, Franklin firmware&lt;ref&gt;Github download https://github.com/mtu-most/franklin&lt;/ref&gt; was created to allow RepRap 3-D printers to be used as general purposes 3-D robots in addition to 3-D printing (e.g. milling, fluid handling, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Wijnen, B., Anzalone, G. C., Haselhuhn, A.S., Sanders, P.G., Pearce, J. M. Free and Open-source Control Software for 3-D Motion and Processing. ''Journal of Open Research Software'', 4: e2, DOI:10.5334/jors.78 [https://www.academia.edu/20974474/Free_and_Open-source_Control_Software_for_3-D_Motion_and_Processing free access]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The closed source [[KISSlicer]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kisslicer.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[repetier host]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.repetier.com/documentation/repetier-host/&lt;/ref&gt; are also used.

Free and open-source 3-D modeling programs like [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[OpenSCAD]], and [[FreeCAD]] are preferred 3-D modeling programs in general for the RepRap community but, virtually any CAD or 3D modeling program can be used with the RepRap, as long as it is capable of producing [[STL (file format)|STL]] files.(slic3r also supports [[Wavefront .obj file|.obj]] and [[Additive Manufacturing File Format|.amf]] files). Thus, content creators make use of any tools they are familiar with, whether they are commercial CAD programs, such as [[SolidWorks]] and [[Autodesk AutoCAD]], [[Autodesk Inventor]], [[Autodesk 123D Design]], [[Tinkercad]], or [[SketchUp]] along with the libre software.

== Replication materials ==
[[File:Robot 3D print timelapse on RepRapPro Fisher.webm|thumb|A timelapse video of a robot model (logo of [[Make (magazine)|Make magazine]]) being printed using FDM on a [[RepRap Fisher]], a delta-style printer.]]RepRaps print objects from [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[Polylactic acid]] (PLA), [[Nylon]] (possibly not all extruders capable), [[HDPE]], [[thermoplastic elastomer|TPE]] and similar [[thermoplastic]]s.

Polylactic acid (PLA) has the engineering advantages of high stiffness, minimal warping, and an attractive translucent colour. It is also biodegradable and plant-derived.

The mechanical properties of RepRap printed PLA and ABS have been tested and have been shown to be equivalent to the [[tensile strengths]] of proprietary printers.&lt;ref&gt;B.M. Tymrak, M. Kreiger, [[J. M. Pearce]] "Mechanical properties of components fabricated with open-source 3-D printers under realistic environmental conditions" ''Materials &amp; Design'', 58, pp. 242-246 (2014).  doi 10.1016/j.matdes.2014.02.038. [https://www.academia.edu/6209168/Mechanical_properties_of_components_fabricated_with_open-source_3-D_printers_under_realistic_environmental_conditions open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in most commercial machines, RepRap users are encouraged to experiment with printing new materials and methods, and to publish their results. Methods for printing novel materials (such as ceramics) have been developed this way. In addition, several [[RecycleBots]] have been designed and fabricated to convert waste plastic, such as shampoo containers and milk jugs, into inexpensive RepRap filament.&lt;ref name="RPJ"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baechler | first1 = Christian | last2 = DeVuono | first2 = Matthew | last3 = Pearce | first3 = Joshua M. | year = | title = Distributed Recycling of Waste Polymer into RepRap Feedstock | url = https://www.academia.edu/2643418/Distributed_Recycling_of_Waste_Polymer_into_RepRap_Feedstock | journal = Rapid Prototyping Journal | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 118–125 | doi=10.1108/13552541311302978}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that using this approach of distributed recycling is better for the environment &lt;ref&gt;Kreiger, M., Anzalone, G.

The RepRap project has identified [[polyvinyl alcohol]] (PVA) as a potentially suitable support material to complement its printing process, although massive overhangs can be made with using thin layers of the primary printing media as support, which are mechanically removed afterwards.

Printing electronics is a major goal of the RepRap project so that it can print its own circuit boards. Several methods have been proposed:

* [[Wood's metal]] or [[Field's metal]]: low-melting point metal alloys to incorporate electrical circuits into the part as it is being formed.
* Silver/carbon-filled polymers: commonly used for repairs to circuit boards and are being contemplated for use for electrically conductive traces.&lt;ref name="plosone_Leight_Bradley"&gt;Simon J.

* Direct extrusion of solder&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.reprap.org/2009/04/first-reprapped-circuit.html RepRap blog 2009] visited 2/26/2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conductive wires: can be laid into a part from a spool during the printing process

Using a [[Gas metal arc welding|MIG]] welder as a print head a RepRap [[deltabot]] stage can be used to print metals like [[steel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/science/an-inexpensive-way-to-print-out-metal-parts.html?_r=0 An Inexpensive Way to Print Out Metal Parts] - The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald C.

== Construction &lt;!-- Linked from History section --&gt; ==
Although the aim of the project is for RepRap to be able to autonomously construct many of its own mechanical components in the near future using fairly low-level resources, several components such as sensors, stepper motors, or [[microcontroller]]s are currently non-replicable using the RepRap's 3D printing technology and therefore have to be produced independently of the RepRap self-replicating process. The goal is to [[asymptotically]] approach 100% replication over a series of evolutionary generations. As one example, from the onset of the project, the RepRap team has explored a variety of approaches to integrating electrically-conductive media into the product. The future success of this initiative should open the door to the inclusion of [[electrical wiring|connective wiring]], [[printed circuit board]]s, and possibly even [[Electric motor|motors]] in RepRapped products. Variations in the nature of the extruded, electrically-conductive media could produce electrical components with different functions from pure conductive traces, not unlike what was done in the sprayed-circuit process of the 1940s named Electronic Circuit Making Equipment (ECME), described in the article on its designer, [[John Sargrove]]. [[Printed electronics]] is a related approach. Another non-replicable component is the threaded rods for the linear motions. A current research area is in using replicated [[Sarrus linkage]]s to replace them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | work = New Scientist | date = 29 May 2010 | title = I, replicator }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==
[[File:RepRap-printing-object.ogv|thumb|alt=Video of RepRap printing an object |Video of RepRap printing an object]]The stated goal of the RepRap project is to produce a pure self-replicating device not for its own sake, but rather to put in the hands of individuals anywhere on the planet, for a minimal outlay of capital, a [[desktop manufacturing]] system that would enable the individual to manufacture many of the artifacts used in everyday life.&lt;ref name="Jones, R. 2011"/&gt; From a theoretical viewpoint, the project is attempting to prove the hypothesis that "[[Rapid prototyping]] and direct writing technologies are sufficiently versatile to allow them to be used to make a [[von Neumann universal constructor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/idmrc/themes/projects/amps/AMPS-Project-RepRap.pdf | title=RepRap—the Replication Rapid Prototyper Project, IdMRC | accessdate=2007-02-19 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406095923/http://www.bath.ac.uk/idmrc/themes/projects/amps/AMPS-Project-RepRap.pdf | archivedate=2012-04-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reverse chronology''' is a method of story-telling whereby the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is revealed in reverse order.

In a story employing this technique, the first [[Scene (fiction)|scene]] shown is actually the conclusion to the plot. Once that scene ends, the penultimate scene is shown, and so on, so that the final scene the viewer sees is the first chronologically.

Many stories employ [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], showing prior events, but whereas the scene order of most conventional films is A-B-C-etc., a film in reverse chronology goes Z-Y-X-etc.

As a hypothetical example, if the [[fairy tale]] ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' was told using reverse chronology, the opening scene would depict Jack chopping the beanstalk down and killing the giant. The next scene would feature Jack being discovered by the giant and climbing down the beanstalk in fear of his life. Later, we would see Jack running into the man with the infamous magic beans, then, at the end of the film, being sent off by his mother to sell the cow.

== Purpose ==
The unusual nature of this method means it is only used in stories of a specific nature. For example, ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' features a man with [[anterograde amnesia]], meaning he is unable to form new memories. The film parallels the protagonist's perspective by unfolding in reverse chronological order, leaving the audience as ignorant of the events that occurred prior to each scene (which, played in reverse chronological order, will not be revealed until later) as the protagonist is.

In the film ''[[Irréversible]],'' an act of [[homicide|homicidal]] violence takes place at the start of the movie (i. e., it is the final event to take place). During the remainder of the film we learn not only that the violence is an act of vengeance, but what exactly is being avenged. The film was highly controversial for its graphic nature; had the scenes been shown in chronological order, this violent content would make it a simple, and pointlessly brutal, revenge movie. However, as it is, told in reverse, the audience is made to consider the exact consequences of each action, and there is often "more than meets the eye."

== Examples of use ==

=== Literature ===
The epic poem ''[[Aeneid]]'', written by [[Virgil]] in the 1st century BC, uses reverse chronology within scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Michael von; &amp; Schmeling, Gareth L. (1997). '' History of Roman Literature: From Livius Andronicus to Boethius, Vol. 1''. Brill. p. 681. {{ISBN|90-04-09630-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', the middle part of the story shows a flashback of events leading up to the discovery of a dead body at the beginning of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–94|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of [[W. R. Burnett]]'s novel, ''Goodbye to the Past'' (1934), moves continually from 1929 to 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David (April 2006). ''The Way Hollywood Tells It: Story and Style in Modern Movies''. [[University of California Press]]. p. 91. {{ISBN|0-520-24622-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Long View'' (1956) by [[Elizabeth Jane Howard]] describes a marriage in reverse chronology from 1950s London back to its beginning in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/30/hilary-mantel-elizabeth-jane-howard-novelist Hilary Mantel in The Guardian, 30 January 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Lewis Wallant]] uses flashbacks in reverse chronology in ''The Human Season'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Serafin, Steven; &amp; Bendixen, Alfred (2003). ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature''. [[Continuum International Publishing Group]].  p. 1189. {{ISBN|0-8264-1517-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel ''Christopher Homm'' (1965), by [[C. H. Sisson]], is also told in reverse chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Head, Dominic (2006). ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 1036. {{ISBN|0-521-83179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip K. Dick]], in his 1967 novel ''[[Counter-Clock World]]'', describes a future in which time has started to move in reverse, resulting in the dead reviving in their own graves ("old-birth"), living their lives in reverse, eventually ending in returning to the womb, and splitting into an egg and a sperm during copulation between a recipient woman and a man. The novel was expanded from Dick's short story "Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday", first published in the August 1966 edition of [[Amazing Stories]].

[[Martin Amis]]'s 1991 novel ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]'' tells the story of a man who, it seems, brings dead people to life. Eventually it is revealed that the story is being seen backwards, and he was a doctor at [[Auschwitz]] who brought death to live people. He escaped to the United States, and the novel starts with his death and ends with his birth. Amis writes in the Afterword that he had a "certain paragraph" from [[Kurt Vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut's]] ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'' (1969) in mind.  As he waits to be taken by aliens to the planet Tralfamadore, the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, watches a war movie backwards. American planes full of holes fly backwards as German planes suck bullets from them; bombers take their bombs back to base where they are returned to the States, reduced to ore and buried. The American fliers became high school kids again, and, Billy guesses, Hitler ultimately returns to babyhood.

[[Iain M. Banks|Iain Banks]]'s novel ''[[Use of Weapons]]'' interweaves two parallel stories, one told in standard chronology and one in reverse, both concluding at a critical moment in the main character's life.

[[Julia Alvarez]]'s novel ''[[How the García Girls Lost Their Accents]]'' opens in 1989 with one of the characters returning to her native Dominican Republic. The story of why the family left and their attempts to succeed in New York are told in reverse chronological order, with the last events happening in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arls.org/2011/11/arls-teen-book-review-how-the-garcia-girls-lost-their-accents/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theatre ===
A number of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] have employed this technique. [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Moss Hart|Moss Hart's]] 1934 play, ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (play)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', is told in reverse order, as is the [[Harold Pinter]] play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' (1978). Kaufman and Hart's play was adapted as [[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|a musical comedy by Stephen Sondheim]] in 1981, and Pinter's play was made into [[Betrayal (1983 film)|a film]] in 1983.

=== Film ===
In 1927, [[Jean Epstein]]'s ''La glace à trois faces'' (''The Three Sided Mirror'') features a sequence where the events happen in reverse, beginning with the protagonist's exit from a room until the viewer sees the entrance. The Czech comedy ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' (1966) is a farce which starts with a guillotined man finding his head popped back on his shoulders and ends with him as a new-born being pushed back into his mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,841358,00.html | work=Time | title=Cinema: Happy End | date=1968-06-28 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atom Egoyan]], influenced by Pinter's plays, tells the story of ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'' (1997) in reverse chronology, with the first scene of the film set in 1977 and the last in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;MacDermott, Felim; &amp; McGrath, Declan (2003). ''Screenwriting''. [[Focal Press]]. p. 172. {{ISBN|0-240-80512-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique was later employed in ''[[Peppermint Candy]]'' (2000), by [[South Korea]]n director [[Lee Chang-dong]]; in ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000), a mystery directed by [[Christopher Nolan]] about short term memory loss; and in [[Jean-Luc Godard|Jean-Luc Godard's]] short film ''De l'origine du XXIe siècle pour moi'' (2000).&lt;ref name="Gateward"&gt;Gateward, Frances K. (2007). ''Seoul Searching: Culture and Identity in Contemporary Korean Cinema''. [[SUNY Press]]. p. 136. {{ISBN|0-7914-7225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Irréversible]]'' (2002), the technique is used so thoroughly that the [[Closing credits|end credits]] are not only shown at the beginning of the movie, but they roll ''down'' the screen, rather than upwards as is familiar.

The first several scenes in 2003's film ''[[Identity (film)|Identity]]'', starring [[John Cusack]], occur in reverse order.

The 2004 film ''[[5x2]]'', directed by [[François Ozon]], tells the story of a relationship between two people in five episodes using reverse chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=313595 | work=The New York Times | first=A. O. | last=Scott | accessdate=2010-05-22 | title=We're Sorry | date=2005-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004), a main substory is told in reverse.

''Coup de Sang'', a French film by Jean Marboeuf (2006), uses limited reverse chronology. The film begins with the revelation that the main character will commit a murder one week from the next scene, although it is not revealed who will be killed or why.

In the 2007 movie ''[[P.S. I Love You (film)|P.S. I Love You]]'', the scenes in which Gerry Kennedy ([[Gerard Butler]]) meets and courts Holly ([[Hilary Swank]]) are shown in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/P-S-I-Love-You-2797.html |author= Calamari, Alexandra |date= 2007 |title= ''P.S. I Love You'' |publisher= Cinema Blend |accessdate= July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 Tamil movie, ''[[Manmadan Ambu (film)|Manmadan Ambu]]'', the song "Neela Vaanam" (visuals inspired by [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]") is shown in a reverse sequence.

=== Television ===
{{See also|The Backwards Episode}}

The made-for-television drama ''[[Two Friends (1986 film)|''Two Friends'']]'' (1986), by [[Jane Campion]], and the 1997 episode, "[[The Betrayal]]", of the hit sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', employs the technique. The ''Seinfeld'' episode is a take-off of the Harold Pinter play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' and has a character named "Pinter."&lt;ref name="Gateward"/&gt;  [[Redrum (The X-Files)|"Redrum"]], a 2000 episode of ''[[The X-Files]],'' uses the technique in focusing on a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The 2002 ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' episode "Hindsight" uses reverse chronology to illustrate the events leading to traumatic car accident. A 1997 [[Star Trek: Voyager|''Star Trek: Voyager'']] episode, "[[Before and After (Star Trek: Voyager)|Before and After]]", which writer Kenneth Biller claimed was based on a [[Martin Amis]] novel [[Time's Arrow (novel)|''Time's Arrow'']], also features a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The [[Sealab 2021|''Sealab 2021'']] episode "Shrabster" is also in reverse order. For a few seasons, the revived [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] had an extensive storyline focusing on a relationship between the Doctor and his companions' daughter (River Song) from the future based on "opposite timelines" (i.e., as the Doctor was travelling through time on one path, River was travelling on an opposite path) causing them to interact in opposite chronological order. In 2017, the British tv mini-series ''Rellik'' (Killer backwards) tells a story about a serial killer in backwards order. In 2018, the episode "[[Once Removed]]", from the series [[Inside No. 9|''Inside No. 9'']] uses reverse chronology to tell a dark story about a family who is moving house, and the murder that subsequently begins. Also from 2018, the second installment of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] anthology series ''[[American Crime Story]]'' focuses on [[The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story|the assassination of designer Gianni Versace]], employing reverse chronology through the course of several episodes to explore the background of Versace's killer Andrew Cunanan.

=== Comics ===
The story "The Time Eater" from issue 40 of the comic "[[Vampirella]]", scripted by Jack Butterworth and published in 1975, included the concept of human lives running backwards. People were shown to be exhumed, reunited with families, separated from their spouses in order to attend school, and finally returned to the womb. Dialogue was reversed also. [[Alan Moore]]'s 1983 short story "The Reversible Man" from issue 308 of the comic "[[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]]" told an ordinary man's life backwards, using the same concept as Butterworth but recasting it as a first-person narrative. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] wrote an issue of the ongoing [[Midnighter]] series told in reverse chronology.  The issue explored the fact that the character Midnighter has the ability to calculate millions of possible scenarios for any given situation.  The issue does not have the scenes in reverse order, but rather the individual pages run backwards.

Issue 43 of Bongo's "[[Simpsons Comics]]" is told in reverse order: the story opens with a depiction of a crane lifting a crashed car out of a lake; each subsequent scene (which lasts for one page) carries a caption informing the reader that it took place, for instance, "20 minutes earlier". The penultimate page jumps back thirty years and shows [[Homer Simpson]] as a child

=== Anime ===
The 2007 anime television series ''[[Touka Gettan]]'' employed entirely this narrative method. All 26 episodes were aired in chronologically reverse order, with the first episode being the ending of the story while the last episode being the beginning.

=== Music ===
The lyrics to "[[All Along the Watchtower#Background|All Along the Watchtower]]", written by [[Bob Dylan]], are, he says, "in a rather reverse order"; indeed, the final verse begins with the words "All along the watchtower", and if reversed, the [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]s would tell the story in the correct order.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The lyrics to "Apparition. Apparitions." by [[Trophy Scars]] describe the events leading up to a woman's suicide in reverse order, beginning with her death and ending with her initial romance with her boyfriend.

The song "One Thing Leads to Another" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] (on a limited release of their 1993 album ''[[Very (Pet Shop Boys album)|Very]]'') describes the events leading up to a man's death in reverse order.

Multiple music videos, including [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]" use reverse chronology in which a scene plays backwards while someone sings normally. This is done by filming the video chronologically but getting the actor to sing the lyrics backwards. The music video for Enigma's "Return to Innocence" uses reverse chronology showing a man's life, beginning with his death as an old man and ending with his baptism as an infant. The music video for [[Linkin Park]]'s "Bleed It Out" also uses the same method, whereas the band performs normally, but everything else is reversed. In 2016, Malaysian Singer-Songwriter Yuna uses reverse chronology in her music video "Lanes".

The events of the song "Reverse" by [[SomeKindaWonderful]], as said in the title itself, are told in reverse chronology.

The lyrics in "Rewind" by NaS also tell a story in reverse chronology, with some of the dialogue even being in reverse order.

"Good Mistake" Album by [[Bahram Nouraei]] is the first Iranian concept album ever made inspired by reverse chronology as the storytelling method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahramnouraei.com/about#/|title=Bahram Nouraei&amp;nbsp;— Official Website|website=bahramnouraei.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been several discussions as to how the picturisation of Neela Vaanam "Manmadan Ambu" (sung by Kamal Haasan himself) has been slightly inspired from official video of Coldplay's The Scientist. The whole song has been depicted in such a way so as to highlight the events that led to the death of Mannar's (Kamal's character) French wife Juliet, in reverse.

=== Video game ===
The [[Dead Island announcement trailer|announcement trailer]] of 2011 video game, ''[[Dead Island]]'', also present in reverse chronological order with flash of chronological action edited into the whole video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg|title=Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer|website=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roboexotica''' (sometimes spelled: ''Roböxotica'') is an annual festival and conference where scientists, researchers, computer experts and artists from all over the world build ''cocktail robots'' and discuss technological [[innovation]], [[futurology]] and [[science fiction]].
Roboexotica is also an ironic attempt to criticize techno-triumphalism and to dissect technological hypes.

The festival is co-produced by Shifz and [[monochrom]], two [[Vienna]]-based art collectives, and supported by the 'Bureau for Philosophy' (of the Department of Philosophy, [[University of Vienna]]). The festival is usually held in the end of November or early December.

==Overview==
The annual international festival consists of an exhibition, a conference, social events, and the ACRA (Annual Cocktail Robot Award).

The exhibition presents [[robot]]s that can mix cocktails, serve cocktails, consume cocktails, have bar conversations, light or smoke [[cigarette]]s or manage to impress the jury with (Quote Roboexotica website) "other achievements in the sector of cocktail culture".

==History==
In 1999, Magnus Wurzer and Chris Veigl (of Shifz) started to present a self-made cocktail robot at the small independent Viennese culture and art space VEKKS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://vekks.yi.org|title=V.E.K.K.S|publisher=Vekks.yi.org|date=|accessdate=2012-03-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305120705/http://vekks.yi.org/|archivedate=2012-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group [[monochrom]] ([[Johannes Grenzfurthner]], Günther Friesinger, Franz Ablinger) first participated with performances and presenting machines, but in 2002 monochrom teamed up with Shifz as organizers and the small event became a big international festival presented at Vienna's [[Museumsquartier]] and several other locations in the Vienna metro area. Roboexotica presents around 20 machines every year and draws around 3000 guests per event. 

Roboexotica was presented at [[Kiberpipa|Cyberpipe]] ([[Ljubljana]]) in 2006, at [[Maker Faire]] ([[San Francisco]]) and [[RoboGames]] ([[San Francisco]]) in 2007.

In 2008 a catalogue titled Roboexotica was published, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the festival. The book features reflections on the festival and presents statements by former participants including [[Cory Doctorow]], [[Dorkbot]]'s Doueglas Repetto, [[Bre Pettis]], [[V. Vale]], Karen Marcelo of [[Survival Research Laboratories]] or [[RoboGames]]' David Calkins and Simone Davalos.

A smaller show called "Roboexotica USA" was held in San Francisco in 2008 and 2009. It was organized by [[monochrom]] and ''Shifz'' and was well received by the press. In 2010 it was decided to rename the San Francisco-based cocktail robot event  "Barbot," and Barbot events were held in San Franicsco in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013.

[[Chase Masterson]] was special guest star at the 20th anniversary edition of cocktail robot festival [[Roboexotica]] in [[Vienna]] and performed a live jazz set for "robots and humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cocktail |url=https://www.vienna.at/roboexotica-20-festival-fuer-cocktailrobotik-in-wien/6002869 |website=vienna.at |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sagan |first1=Sonja |title=OTS0037, 20.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4548">'''Shape theory''' is a branch of [[topology]], which provides a more global view of the topological spaces than [[homotopy theory]]. The two coincide on compacta dominated homotopically by finite polyhedra. Shape theory associates with the Čech homology theory while homotopy theory associates with the singular homology theory.

==Background==

Shape theory was reinvented, further developed and promoted by the Polish mathematician [[Karol Borsuk]] in 1968. Actually, the name ''shape theory'' was coined by Borsuk.

===Warsaw Circle===

Borsuk lived and worked in [[Warsaw]], hence the name of one of the fundamental examples of the area, the Warsaw circle. This is a compact subset of the plane produced by "closing up" a [[topologist's sine curve]] with an arc.
[[File:Warsaw Circle.png|thumb|The Warsaw Circle.]]  It has [[homotopy group]]s [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to those of a point, but is not [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] to a point—instead, the Warsaw circle is shape-equivalent to a circle (one dimensional sphere). [[Whitehead theorem|Whitehead's theorem]] does not apply to Warsaw circle because it is not a CW complex.

==Development==

Borsuk's shape theory was generalized onto arbitrary (non-metric) compact spaces, and even onto general categories, by Włodzimierz Holsztyński in year 1968/1969, and published in Fund. Math. '''70''' , 157-168, y.1971 (see Jean-Marc Cordier, Tim Porter, (1989) below). This was done in a ''continuous style'', characteristic for the Čech homology rendered by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and Norman Steenrod in their monograph ''Foundations of Algebraic Topology''. Due to the circumstance{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}, Holsztyński's paper was hardly noticed, and instead a great popularity in the field was gained by a much less advanced (more naive) paper by [[Sibe Mardešić]] and Jack Segal, which was published a little later, Fund. Math. '''72''', 61-68, y.1971. Further developments are reflected by the references below, and by their contents.

For some purposes, like dynamical systems, more sophisticated invariants were developed under the name '''strong shape'''. Generalizations to [[noncommutative geometry]], e.g. the shape theory for [[operator algebra]]s have been found.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7667">A system of '''skew coordinates''' is a [[curvilinear coordinates|curvilinear]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SkewCoordinateSystem.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[coordinate system]] where the [[Coordinate_system#Coordinate_surface|coordinate surfaces]] are not [[orthogonal]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SkewCoordinateSystem.html Skew Coordinate System] at [[Mathworld]]&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[orthogonal coordinates]].

Skew coordinates tend to be more complicated to work with compared to orthogonal coordinates since the [[metric tensor]] will have nonzero off-diagonal components, preventing many simplifications in formulas for [[tensor algebra]] and [[tensor calculus]]. The nonzero off-diagonal components of the metric tensor are a direct result of the non-orthogonality of the basis vectors of the coordinates, since by definition:&lt;ref name=p13&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g_{i j} = \mathbf e_i \cdot \mathbf e_j&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g_{i j}&lt;/math&gt; is the metric tensor and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt; the (covariant) [[basis vector]]s.

These coordinate systems can be useful if the geometry of a problem fits well into a skewed system. For example, solving [[Laplace's equation]] in a [[parallelogram]] will be easiest when done in appropriately skewed coordinates.

==Cartesian coordinates with one skewed axis==

[[Image:SkewCartesianSystem.svg|thumb|right|A coordinate system where the ''x'' axis has been bent toward the ''z'' axis.]]

The simplest 3D case of a skew coordinate system is a [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian]] one where one of the axes (say the ''x'' axis) has been bent by some angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, staying orthogonal to one of the remaining two axes. For this example, the ''x'' axis of a Cartesian coordinate has been bent toward the ''z'' axis by &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, remaining orthogonal to the ''y'' axis.

===Algebra and useful quantities===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_3&lt;/math&gt; respectively be unit vectors along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axes. These represent the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] basis; computing their dot products gives the following components of the [[metric tensor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{11} = g_{22} = g_{33} = 1 \quad ; \quad g_{12} = g_{23} = 0 \quad ; \quad g_{13} = \cos\left(\frac \pi 2 - \phi\right) = \sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{g} = \mathbf e_1 \cdot (\mathbf e_2 \times \mathbf e_3) = \cos(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

which are quantities that will be useful later on.

The contravariant basis is given by&lt;ref name=p13/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e^1 = \frac{\mathbf e_2 \times \mathbf e_3}{\sqrt{g}} = \frac{\mathbf e_2 \times \mathbf e_3}{\cos(\phi)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e^2 = \frac{\mathbf e_3 \times \mathbf e_1}{\sqrt{g}} = \mathbf e_2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e^3 = \frac{\mathbf e_1 \times \mathbf e_2}{\sqrt{g}} = \frac{\mathbf e_1 \times \mathbf e_2}{\cos(\phi)}&lt;/math&gt;

The contravariant basis isn't a very convenient one to use, however it shows up in definitions so must be considered. We'll favor writing quantities with respect to the covariant basis.

Since the basis vectors are all constant, vector addition and subtraction will simply be familiar component-wise adding and subtraction. Now, let

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \sum_i a^i \mathbf e_i \quad \mbox{and} \quad \mathbf b = \sum_i b^i \mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt;

where the sums indicate summation over all values of the index (in this case, ''i'' = 1, 2, 3). The [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant and covariant]] components of these vectors may be related by

:&lt;math&gt;a^i = \sum_j a_j g^{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

so that, explicitly,

:&lt;math&gt;a^1 = \frac{a_1 - \sin(\phi) a_3}{\cos^2(\phi)},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 = a_2,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a^3 = \frac{-\sin(\phi) a_1 + a_3}{\cos^2(\phi)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[dot product]] in terms of contravariant components is then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = \sum_i a^i b_i = a^1 b^1 + a^2 b^2 + a^3 b^3 + \sin(\phi) (a^1 b^3 + a^3 b^1)&lt;/math&gt;

and in terms of covariant components

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = \cos^2(\phi) [ a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 - \sin(\phi) (a_1 b_3 + a_3 b_1) ].&lt;/math&gt;

===Calculus===

By definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; the [[gradient]] of a scalar function ''f'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = \sum_i \mathbf e^i \frac{\partial f}{\partial q^i} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \mathbf e^1 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \mathbf e^2 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \mathbf e^3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinates ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' indexed. Recognizing this as a vector written in terms of the contravariant basis, it may be rewritten:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = 
\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} - \sin(\phi) \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}}{\cos(\phi)^2} \mathbf e_1 + 
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \mathbf e_2 + 
\frac{-\sin(\phi) \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}}{\cos(\phi)^2} \mathbf e_3.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[divergence]] of a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}} \sum_i \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}\left(\sqrt{g} a^i\right) = \frac{\partial a^1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial a^2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial a^3}{\partial z}.&lt;/math&gt;

and of a tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}} \sum_{i, j} \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}\left(\sqrt{g} a^{ij} \mathbf e_j\right) = 
\sum_{i, j} \mathbf e_j \frac{\partial a^{ij}}{\partial q^i}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Laplacian]] of ''f'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 f = \nabla \cdot \nabla f = 
\frac{1}{\cos(\phi)^2}\left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2} - 2 \sin(\phi) \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial z}\right) + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and, since the covariant basis is normal and constant, the [[vector Laplacian]] is the same as the componentwise Laplacian of a vector written in terms of the covariant basis.

While both the dot product and gradient are somewhat messy in that they have extra terms (compared to a Cartesian system) the [[advection|advection operator]] which combines a dot product with a gradient turns out very simple:

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf a \cdot \nabla) = \left(\sum_i a^i e_i\right) \cdot \left(\sum_i \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i} \mathbf e^i\right) = \left(\sum_i a^i \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

which may be applied to both scalar functions and vector functions, componentwise when expressed in the covariant basis.

Finally, the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a vector is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf a = \sum_{i, j, k} \mathbf e_k \epsilon^{ijk} \frac{\partial a_i}{\partial q^i} = &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\cos(\phi)}\left(

[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A soup kitchen in [[Montreal, Quebec]], [[Canada]] in 1931.]]
A '''soup kitchen''', '''meal center,''' or '''food kitchen''' is a place where [[food]] is offered to the hungry usually for free or sometimes at a below market [[price]]. Frequently located in lower-income neighborhoods, soup kitchens are often staffed by [[Volunteering|volunteer]] organizations, such as [[Church body|church]] or community groups. Soup kitchens sometimes obtain food from a [[food bank]] for free or at a low price, because they are considered a [[Charitable organization|charity]], which makes it easier for them to feed the many people who require their services.

Many historical and some modern soup kitchens serve only [[soup]] (hence its name) with perhaps some bread. But several establishments which title themselves as a "soup kitchen" also serve other types of food, so social scientists sometimes discuss them together with similar hunger relief agencies that provide more varied hot meals, like food kitchens and meal centers.

While societies have been using various methods to share food with the hungry for millennia, the first soup kitchens in the modern sense may have emerged in the late 18th century. By the late 19th century, they were to be found in several American and European cities. In the [[United States]] and elsewhere, they became more prominent in the 20th century during the [[Great Depression]]. With the improved economic conditions that followed [[World War II]], soup kitchens became less widely used, at least in the advanced economies. In the United States there was a resurgence in the use of soup kitchens following the cutbacks in welfare that were implemented in the early 1980s.

In the 21st century, the use of soup kitchens expanded in both the United States and Europe, following [[2007–08 world food price crisis|lasting global increases in the price of food]] which began in late 2006. Demand for their services grew as the [[Great Recession]] began to worsen economic conditions for those on low income. In much of Europe, demand further increased after the introduction of [[austerity]]-based economic policies from 2010.

==History==
The earliest occurrences of soup kitchens are difficult to identify. Throughout history, societies have invariably recognized a [[moral obligation]] to feed the hungry. The philosopher [[Simone Weil]] wrote that feeding the hungry when one has resources to do so is the most obvious obligation of all. She also said that as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]], it was believed that people needed to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Simone Weil]]|title=[[The Need for Roots]]|page=6|year=2002 |orig-year=1942|isbn=0-415-27102-9|publisher=[[Routledge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soup has long been one of the most economical and simple ways to supply nutritious food to large numbers of people.&lt;ref name ="allAboutSoup"&gt;

Social historian [[Karl Polanyi]] wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organisation in the 19th century, most human societies would generally either starve all together or not at all; because, communities would naturally share their food. As markets began to replace the older forms of resource allocation such as [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|Redistribution]], [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|Reciprocity]], and [[Autarky]], society's overall level of food security would typically rise. But food insecurity could become worse for the poorest section of society, and the need arose for more formal methods for providing them with food.&lt;ref name ="GreatTransformation"&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Karl Polanyi]]|title=[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]|year=2002 |orig-year=1942|chapter=chpt. 1-5|ISBN=978-0-8070-5643-1|publisher=Beacon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian churches traditionally provided food for the hungry since [[Late antiquity]], with the nourishment mainly provided in the form of [[soup]].

===Emergence of the modern soup kitchen===
[[Image:Count Rumford.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Sir Benjamin Thompson, painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], 1783.]]
The earliest modern soup kitchens were established by the inventor [[Benjamin Thompson|Sir Benjamin Thompson]], who was employed as an [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] in the 1790s. Thompson was an American loyalist refugee from New England, and an inventor who was ennobled by Bavaria as Count Rumford. The Count was a prominent advocate of hunger relief, writing pamphlets that were widely read across Europe.

His message was especially well received in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], where he had previously held a senior government position for several years and was known as "the Colonel". An urgent need had recently arisen in Britain for food relief, due to its leading role in driving the [[Industrial Revolution]]. While technological development and economic reforms were rapidly increasingly overall prosperity, conditions for the poorest were often made worse, as traditional ways of life were disrupted. In the closing years of the 18th century, soup kitchens run on the principles pioneered by Rumford were to be found throughout [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Scotland]], with about 60,000 people being fed by them daily in [[London]] alone.&lt;ref name="allAboutSoup"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CountRumford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/food/2010/12/count-rumford-and-the-history-of-the-soup-kitchen/|title=Count Rumford and the History of the Soup Kitchen|publisher=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|author=Lisa Bramen|date=29 December 2010|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Shadow Behind Our Founding Fathers: A traitor, a scientist, a womanizer and an enigma" review of Nicholas Delbanco's ''The Count of Concord'' '''Book World''' p. 9, 22 June 2008, ''The Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While soup kitchens were generally well regarded, they did attract criticism from some, for encouraging dependency, and sometimes on a local level for attracting vagrants to an area. In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] they were made illegal, along with other forms of aid apart from workhouses, by the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law Amendment Act]] of 1834.{{efn|Note that criticism of soup kitchens was only a minor driver of the 1834 law - the move was driven more by free market ideology and discontent with other forms of "outdoor" aid like the much more widely disliked Speemhanland system, see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom]].}}

During the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish famine]] of the 19th century, in which as many as one million people may have died, the [[British government]] passed the [[Temporary Relief Act]] (also known as the Soup Kitchen Act) in February 1847. The Act amended the restrictions on the provision of aid outside the workhouses for the duration of the famine, and expressly allowed the establishment of soup kitchens in Ireland to relieve pressure from the overstretched [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]] system, which was proving to be totally inadequate in coping with the disaster.&lt;ref name = "Poverty"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwendolyn Mink and Alice O'Connor|title=Poverty in the United States|pages=321–323|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-597-4|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell Bartoletti|first=Susan|title=Black potatoes: the story of the great Irish famine, 1845-1850|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2001|pages=75|isbn=978-0-618-00271-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdmQoaeVuG4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA75&amp;lpg=RA1-PA75&amp;dq=%22Soup+Kitchen+Act%22+1847&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8KuSXfbTHx&amp;sig=KPV_4StEhWpvltXv5_7s161nGbQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OlBrSqmjDJmOjAfihr2eCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prohibition against soup kitchens was soon relaxed on mainland Britain too, though they never again became as prevalent as they had been in the early 19th century, partly as from the 1850s onwards, economic conditions generally began to improve even for the poorest. For the first few decades after the return of soup kitchens to mainland [[Great Britain|Britain]], they were at first heavily regulated, run by groups like the [[Charity Organization Society]]. Even in the early 20th century, campaigning journalists like [[Bart Kennedy]] would criticize them for their long queues, and for the degrading questions staff would ask the hungry before giving out any soup.&lt;ref name ="allAboutSoup"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="GreatTransformation"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"/&gt;

===Spread to the United States===
[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen opened by [[Al Capone]] in Depression-era [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the [[United States|US]], 1931.|upright=1.15]]
The concept of soup kitchens spread to the [[United States]] from Ireland after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great famine]] and the concomitant wave of Irish emigration to the [[New World]].&lt;ref name = "Poverty" /&gt; The earliest ones were established in the 1870s. A sharp rise in the number of hungry people resulting from an industrial recession coincided with the success of the  [[Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor|AICP,]] and the American branch of the ''Charity Organization Society'' in getting various forms of "outdoor relief"{{efn|In the main, this meant ending the practice where municipal officials would give out small sums of cash to the poor. Unlike in Britain a few decades earlier, the US did not pass nationwide laws restricting private individuals from giving food to the hungry.}} banned. This resulted in civil society establishing soup kitchens, to help feed those of the poor who did not wish to subject themselves to the regimented organisation of the [[Almshouses]] favored by the charitable societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Todd DePastino]]|title=Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America|page=22|year=2005|isbn=0226143791|publisher=[[Chicago University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ollas comunes en 1932.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Chilean people|Chilean women]] preparing soup kitchen meals in 1932.]]
It is believed the term “breadline” entered the popular lexicon in the 1880s. It was during those years that a noteworthy bakery in New York City’s Greenwich Village, “Fleischmann Model Viennese Bakery,” instituted a policy of distributing unsold baked goods to the poor at the end of their business day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wetsteon |first=Ross |title=Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village, the American Bohemia, 1910–1960 |location= |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=2003 |at=preface |isbn=0-684-86996-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
By the late 19th century  soup kitchens were to be found in several US cities.&lt;ref name="CountRumford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HungerModHist"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Vernon|title=Hunger: A Modern History|chapter=Chpts. 1-3|year=2007|isbn=0674026780|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of soup kitchens hit the mainstream of [[United States]] consciousness during the [[Great Depression]]. One soup kitchen in [[Chicago]] was even sponsored by [[United States|American]] mobster [[Al Capone]] in an effort to clean up his image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/history/acoffee.html "Soup Kitchens"] ''Social Security Online History Page''.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the improved economic conditions that followed the Second World War, there was less need for soup kitchens in advanced economies.&lt;ref name = "sweet"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janet Poppendieck|title=Sweet Charity?: Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement|chapter=Introduction, Chpt 1|year=1999|isbn=0140245561|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the scaling back of welfare provision in the 1980s under [[Ronald Reagan|president Reagan]]'s administration, there was a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies such as soup kitchens. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks, about 80% of emergency kitchens, and all known food rescue organisations, were established in the US after 1981.&lt;ref name= "sweet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="walter"/&gt; Presently, [[Catholic Charities USA]] of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], founded by [[Sisters of Loretto|The Sisters of Loretto]], provides food to upwards of 600-700 persons or more per day, and has been doing so since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccharitiescc.org/what-we-do/marian-house/soup-kitchen/|title=Marian House Soup Kitchen|author=|date=|website=ccharitiescc.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the 21st century==

Use of soup kitchens has grown rapidly across the world, following the lasting global inflation in the cost of food that began in late 2006. The ''global financial crisis'' further increased the demand for soup kitchens, as did the introduction of austerity policies that have become common in Europe since 2010. Modern soup kitchens are generally well regarded, though like their historical counterparts they are sometimes disliked by local residents for lowering the tone of a neighborhood.&lt;ref name="walter"&gt;{{cite book

=== World's largest soup kitchen===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]] (Kitchen), food is served to all visitors regardless of faith, religion, or background. Only vegetarian food is served and people eat together as equals. The institution of the [[Sikh]] langar, a community run free kitchen, was started by the first Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]]. It was designed to uphold the principle of equality between all people regardless of religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender, or social status. In addition to the ideals of equality, the tradition of langar expresses the ethics of sharing, community, inclusiveness, and oneness of humankind. Every Sikh [[Gurdwara|shrine]] has a [[Selfless service|religiously sanctioned moral and humanitarian obligation to serve]] and [[Langar (Sikhism)|provide hospitality, provisions, nourishments and meals]] to any man, regardless of race, creed, religious profession, identification, or affiliation.

=== Comparison with front line food banks and pantries===
[[File:US Navy 090806-N-6220J-004 Sailors and Navy Delayed Entry Program members serve breakfast to homeless men and women at Dorothy's Soup Kitchen in Salinas, Calif. during Salinas Navy Week community service event.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[United States Navy]] serve the homeless at Dorothy's Soup Kitchen, [[Salinas, California]] in 2009.]]
In some countries such as [[UK|Great Britain]], increased demand from hungry people has largely been met by [[food bank]]s, operating on the "front line" model, where they give food out directly to the hungry. In the USA, such establishments are called "food pantries"; Americans generally reserve the term "food bank" for entities which perform a warehouse-like function, distributing food to front line agencies, but not directly to the hungry themselves. Instead of providing hot meals, front line food banks and pantries hand out packages of groceries so that recipients can cook themselves several meals at home. This is often more convenient for the end user. They can receive food for up to a dozen or so meals at once, whereas with a soup kitchen, they typically only receive a single meal with each visit.{{efn|Although some soup kitchens also like to give visitors a second "carry out" meal.}}

Food banks typically have procedures needed to prevent unscrupulous people taking advantage of them, unlike soup kitchens which will usually give a meal to whomever turns up with no questions asked. The soup kitchen's greater accessibility can make it more suitable for assisting people with long-term dependence on food aid. Soup kitchens can also provide warmth, companionship, and the shared communal experience of dining with others, which can be especially valued by people such as disabled, pensioners, widowers, homeless and ex-homeless. In some countries such as Greece, soup kitchens have become the most widely used form of food aid, with ''[[The Guardian]]'' reporting in 2012, that an estimated 400,000 Greeks visit a soup kitchen each day.&lt;ref name = "Poverty"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "walter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Stiefografie''', also called '''Stiefo''' or '''Rationelle Stenografie''' (Rational Shorthand), is a [[German language|German]] [[shorthand]] system. It was invented by Helmut Stief (1906–1977), a German press and parliamentary stenographer, and first published in 1966.

Helmut Stief was dissatisfied with the [[Deutsche Einheitskurzschrift]] so he created a much simpler alternative system. According to Stief the [[eponym]]ous shorthand system Stiefografie can be quickly learned within a very short time. There are only 25 characters to learn in the first level Grundschrift (business script). Stiefografie is in [[Germany]] the most popular form of the new stenography systems published since the 1950s.

==Writing==
The system has only a minimum number of rules. Like most systems of shorthand, Stiefografie is a [[phonetic]] system. Sounds and words are written as they are spoken. [[Silent letter]]s are ignored.

The [[consonant]] signs are made by simplifying the features of [[cursive]] [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letters. Vowel signs are only used when a vowel stands at the end of a word. Vowels in the beginning or in the middle of words are represented symbolically by varying the position of the following consonant signs.

Stiefografie does not employ shading (variation of thickness of strokes) to distinguish [[vowel]] symbols. Shading is nowadays difficult to achieve with a [[ballpoint pen]],  a [[stylus]] or finger input for smart phones or tablet computers.

The [[punctuation]] marks [[full stop]], [[semicolon]] and [[comma]] are not used because they look like some brief forms of very frequent German words in Aufbauschrift (speed script and speech script) and could be confused with these words. These punctuation marks are replaced by different space intervals between the sentences and phrases.

==Division of the system==
Stiefografie shorthand is written in three levels: Grundschrift (business script), Aufbauschrift I (speed script) and Aufbauschrift II (speech script).

''Grundschrift'' can be produced at a rate of 100 to 120 syllables per [[minute]]. There are only 24 characters for consonants and combinations of consonants (e.g. sch, sp, st). Contrary to the practice in many English shorthand systems (e.g. [[Pitman Shorthand]]), vowels are never omitted. There are no brief forms for the most frequent [[syllable]]s and words of the German language in this first level.

''Aufbauschrift I'' can be produced up to 160 syllables per minute. There are 54 brief forms for the most frequent words and syllables in the German language and rules for forming free abbreviations. These brief forms are distinguishable by size and position (three of them: above, below, or on the base line). Special endings and syllables can be omitted.
 
There are more than additional 120 brief forms in ''Aufbauschrift II'' to write up to about 400 syllables per minute. It is possible to omit special consonants, vowels and syllables.

[[File:Sonnensensor.jpg|thumbnail|right|Non-linear sun sensor used by the [[TET-1]] German [[Miniaturized satellite|microsatellite]].]]
A '''sun sensor''' is a [[navigational instrument]] used by [[spacecraft]] to detect the position of the [[sun]].&lt;ref name="airbus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt; Sun sensors are used for [[attitude control]], [[solar array]] pointing, [[gyroscope|gyro]] updating, and [[safe mode (spacecraft)|fail-safe]] recovery.&lt;ref name="adcole_DSS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adcole_HA"/&gt;

In addition to spacecraft, sun sensors find use in ground-based [[weather station]]s and sun-tracking systems, and aerial vehicles including [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]]s and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s.&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt;

==Mechanism==
There are various types of sun sensors, which differ in their technology and performance characteristics. Sun presence sensors provide a [[binary number|binary]] output, indicating when the sun is within the sensor's [[field of view]]. [[Analog electronics|Analog]] and [[digital electronics|digital]] sun sensors, in contrast, indicate the angle of the sun by continuous and [[discrete signal]] outputs, respectively.&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt;

In typical sun sensors, a thin slit at the top of a rectangular chamber allows a line of light to fall on an array of [[photodetector]] cells at the bottom of the chamber. A voltage is induced in these cells, which is registered electronically. By orienting two sensors perpendicular to each other, the direction of the sun can be fully determined.&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt;

Often, multiple sensors will share processing electronics.&lt;ref name="adcole_DSS"/&gt;

==Criteria==
There are a number of design and performance criteria which dictate the selection of a sun sensor model:
*[[Field of view]]
*[[Angular resolution]]
*[[Accuracy and precision|Accuracy]] and [[Stochastic drift|stability]]
*[[Mass]] and [[volume]]
*Input voltage and power
*Output characteristics (including electrical characteristics, update frequency, [[nonlinearity]], and encoding)
*Durability (including [[radiation hardening]] and tolerance to [[vibration]] and [[residual stress|thermal cycling]])

[[File:Diego Garcia Island Map.jpg|thumb|A map of military installations on Diego Garcia in 2002]]
In 2008 it was exposed in [[TIME]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1828469,00.html|title=Source: US Used UK Isle for Interrogations|first=Adam|last=Zagorin|date=31 July 2008|publisher=|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazine by  [[Lawrence Wilkerson]] that a secret [[War on Terror]] prison had existed on the island of [[Diego Garcia]] from 2002–2006. He claimed that Diego Garcia was used by the [[CIA]] for "nefarious activities". He said that he had heard from three US intelligence sources that Diego Garcia was used as "a transit site where people were temporarily housed, let us say, and interrogated from time to time" and, "What I heard was more along the lines of using it as a transit location when perhaps other places were full or other places were deemed too dangerous or insecure, or unavailable at the moment".&lt;ref name="guardian-20150130"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/30/cia-interrogation-diego-garcia-lawrence-wilkerson |title=CIA interrogated suspects on Diego Garcia, says Colin Powell aide |author=Ian Cobain |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 January 2015 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph-20150130"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11380992/Terror-suspects-were-interrogated-on-Diego-Garcia-US-official-admits.html |title=Terror suspects were interrogated on Diego Garcia, US official admits |agency=Press Association |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=30 January 2015 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, the British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] stated that United States authorities had repeatedly assured him that no detainees had passed in transit through Diego Garcia or were disembarked there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Written Answers to Questions 21 June 2004 | journal=Hansard House of Commons Daily Debates| publisher=UK Parliament | volume= 422 | issue=part 605 | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040621/text/40621w13.htm#40621w13.html_wqn9 | accessdate=2008-02-21 | format= – &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AWritten+Answers+to+Questions+%5B%5B21+June%5D%5D+%5B%5B2004%5D%5D&amp;as_publication=Hansard+House+of+Commons+Daily+Debates&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diego Garcia was first rumoured to have been one of the locations of the [[CIA]]'s [[black sites]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=TorStar20050702&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2005/050702-island-torture.htm | title=Island paradise or torture chamber? | publisher=[[The Toronto Star]] | author=Lynda Hurst | date=July 2, 2005 | accessdate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] is one of the "[[high-value detainees]]" suspected to have been held in Diego Garcia.&lt;ref name=AssociatePress20060316&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2006/060316-detainee-transcripts.htm | title=Detainee transcripts reveal more questions | agency=Associated Press | author=Andrew Selsky | date=March 16, 2006 | accessdate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2007, the [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]] of the British Parliament announced that it would launch an investigation of continued allegations of a prison camp on Diego Garcia, which it claimed were twice confirmed by comments made by retired United States Army General [[Barry McCaffrey]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{Cite news| author1=Ian Cobain |author2=Richard Norton-Taylor | url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,,2194649,00.html | title=Claims of secret CIA jail for terror suspects on British island to be investigated | work=The Guardian | date=2007-10-19 | accessdate=2007-10-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 July 2008, an unnamed former White House official alleged that the United States had imprisoned and interrogated at least one suspect on Diego Garcia during 2002 and possibly 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1828469,00.html | work=Time | title=Source: US Used UK Isle for Interrogations | date=2008-07-31 | accessdate=2010-05-01 | first=Adam | last=Zagorin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of the site was confirmed by US general [[Barry McCaffrey]], and Swiss Senator [[Dick Marty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/humanrights.terrorism|title=Diego Garcia: the UK's shame|date=4 August 2008|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Manfred Nowak]], one of five of the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on [[torture]], says that credible evidence exists supporting allegations that ships serving as black sites have used Diego Garcia as a base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/19/alqaida.usa |title=Claims of secret CIA jail for terror suspects on British island to be investigated |first1=Ian |last1=Cobain |author2=Richard Norton-Taylor |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human rights group [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] alleges that United States-operated ships moored outside the [[territorial waters]] of Diego Garcia were used to incarcerate and torture detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author=Jamie Doward | title=British island 'used by US for rendition' | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/02/ciarendition.unitednations | work=The Observer | date=2008-03-02 | accessdate=2008-03-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inmates included [[Mustafa Setmariam Nasar]], and [[Riduan Isamuddin]] was held there before being transferred to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. The United Kingdom government, who lease the island to the US, denied any knowledge of the incident, saying that two prisoners had passed through Diego Garcia but the plane they were on had only stopped to refuel. Nasar's location is still unknown since his arrival on Diego Garcia was announced in Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pais]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2008/05/18/domingo/1211082753_850215.html|title=Reportaje - Un 'yihadista' en el limbo|first=Ediciones El|last=País|date=18 May 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2014, the [[United States Senate Intelligence Committee]] published a 600-page unclassified summary of its 6,700 page secret report on the CIA's abuse of its secret prisoners.&lt;ref name="DailyMail2014-12-20"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
David Jones, writing in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', expressed surprise that Diego Garcia went entirely unmentioned on every page of the unclassified summary, and speculated that pressure from UK security agencies caused the portions of the report that covered CIA prisoner facilities on the island to remain classified.

The '''value of control''' is a quantitative measure of the value of controlling the outcome of an [[random variable|uncertain variable]]. [[Decision analysis]] provides a means for calculating the value of both '''perfect''' and '''imperfect control'''. The former value, informally known as the '''value of wizardry''', is an upper bound for the latter. Obtaining meaningful value-of-control measurements requires an awareness of important restrictions (concerning the nature of [[free will]] and the meaning of [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] statements) on the validity of this kind of analysis.

He is surrounded by eight [[Buddharupa|Buddhas]] and [[bodhisattva]]s (clockwise from top: [[Ratnasambhava]], [[Samantabhadra]], Saṅkusumitarāja, [[Manjushri]], [[Amitābha]], [[Avalokiteśvara]], [[Amoghasiddhi]] and [[Maitreya]])]]
In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, the '''Womb Realm''' ({{lang-sa|garbhakoṣadhātu}}, {{lang-ja|胎蔵界}} ''taizōkai'') is the metaphysical space inhabited by the [[Wisdom King]]s. The Womb Realm is based on the ''[[Mahavairocana Tantra]]''. The name of the mandala derives from chapter 2 of the sutra, where it is said that the buddha [[Vairocana|Mahāvairocana]] revealed the mandala's secret teachings to his disciple [[Vajrasattva]] from his "womb of compassion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other translations, the term ''matrix realm'' or Matrix Mandala are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hakeda | first = Yoshito S. | title = Kūkai and His Major Works | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-231-05933-7 | pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Womb Realm is a very popular subject for [[mandala]]s, and along with the [[Diamond Realm]] (''vajradhātu'') Mandala forms the [[Mandala of the Two Realms]].  This mandala, along with the Diamond Realm, form the core of Japanese [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] Buddhist rituals, including [[abhisheka]] "initiation". In this ritual, new initiates are blindfolded and asked to toss a flower upon a mandala.  Where the flower lands helps decide which Buddhist figure the student should devote themselves to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hakeda | first = Yoshito S. | title = Kūkai and His Major Works | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-231-05933-7 | pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional Shingon halls, the Womb Realm Mandala is hung on the east wall, symbolizing the young stage of Mahāvairocana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hakeda | first = Yoshito S. | title = Kūkai and His Major Works | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-231-05933-7 | pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;In this setting, the Diamond Realm Mandala is hung on the west wall symbolizing the final realization of Mahāvairocana.
