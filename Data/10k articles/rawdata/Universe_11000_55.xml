==Plot==
[[Italy]], year 2061: After a terrible energy crisis due to the [[Peak oil|depletion of oil stocks]], the Earth is plunged into a kind of new [[Middle Ages]]. Italy as a nation no longer exists, the peninsula has returned to being a divided country, almost pre-[[Risorgimento]], where now reigns the political situation is similar to that before the reunification of 1861:
* The secessionist of [[Lega Nord]] have conquered [[Milan]], creating the [[Lombardy|Lombard Republic]] with [[Turin]] as its capital, defended by a high wall erected on the [[Po (river)|Po River]] to block the entrance to the "southerners";
* In [[Emilia-Romagna]] has been proclaimed "[[People's Republic]] of Sickle and Mortadella", which is famous for [[mortadella]], [[rubles]] and dance halls;
* [[Tuscany]] is back to being a [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Grand Duchy]], where the houses Della Valle and Cecchi Gori are struggling for power;
* In [[Rome]], the [[Papal States|Papal State]] is reborn, a fundamentalist regime dominated by the [[Inquisition]];
* The [[Southern Italy|South]] has been invaded instead by Africans, who have created the rich "[[Sultanate]] of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]]", an Islamic state where Arabic is the official language.

Just from the South, a group of adventurous patriots of the insurrectional movement "[[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]]", made up of volunteers Tony, Pride, Grosso, Salvim and Taned, and led by Ademaro Maroncelli (teacher at the [[Liceo classico|Classical Lyceum]] [[Massimo D'Alema]] of Turin) undertakes a difficult journey to the [[Piedmont]], in order, two hundred years later, to reunify Italy.

'''Cirrus intortus''' is a variety of [[cirrus cloud]]. The name ''cirrus intortus'' is derived from [[Latin]], meaning "twisted, wound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of intortus |url=http://latinlexicon.org/definition.php?p1=2030263 |accessdate=13 July 2011 |author=Numen - The Latin Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of intortus clouds is specific to cirrus clouds, and they appear as interwound strands of cirrus clouds with a purely random pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunlop |first=Storm |title=The weather identification handbook |year=2003 |publisher=Lyons Press |location=Guilford, Conn. |isbn=1-58574-857-9 |pages=58 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BR2ft4G5TgQC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q=intortus&amp;f=false |edition=1st Lyons Press |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filaments are often curved in a very irregular pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Callanan |first=Martin |title=Cirrus intortus |url=http://nephology.eu/cirrus/cirrus-intortus |work=International Cloud Atlas |publisher=nephology.eu |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cloud condensation nuclei''' or '''CCNs''' (also known as '''cloud seeds''') are small particles typically 0.2 [[Micrometre|µm]], or 1/100th the size of a [[cloud]] droplet &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/classes/met130/notes/chapter5/ccn.html|title=Formation of Haze, Fog, and Clouds: Condensation Nuclei|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on which water vapor condenses. Water requires a non-gaseous surface to make the transition from a [[vapour]] to a [[liquid]]; this process is called condensation. In the atmosphere, this surface presents itself as tiny solid or liquid particles called CCNs. When no CCNs are present, [[water vapour]] can be supercooled at about −13°C (8°F) for 5–6 hours before droplets spontaneously form (this is the basis of the [[cloud chamber]] for detecting subatomic particles).{{Citation needed|reason=Very specific figures, but no source to verify|date=November 2017}} In above freezing temperatures the air would have to be [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] to around 400% before the droplets could form.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The concept of cloud condensation nuclei is used in [[cloud seeding]], that tries to encourage rainfall by seeding the air with condensation nuclei.  It has further been suggested that creating such nuclei could be used for [[marine cloud brightening]], a [[climate engineering]] technique.{{Citation needed|reason=Suggested by whom?|date=November 2017}}

==Size, abundance, and composition==
A typical raindrop is about 2 mm in diameter, a typical cloud droplet is on the order of 0.02&amp;nbsp;mm, and a typical cloud condensation nucleus ([[Particulate|aerosol]]) is on the order of 0.0001&amp;nbsp;mm or 0.1&amp;nbsp;µm or greater in diameter. The number of cloud condensation nuclei in the air can be measured and ranges between around 100 to 1000 per cubic centimetre. The total mass of CCNs injected into the atmosphere has been estimated at 2x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg over a year's time.{{Citation needed|reason=No source for information in this paragraph|date=November 2017}}

There are many different types of atmospheric [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] that can act as CCN. The particles may be composed of dust or [[clay]], [[soot]] or black carbon from grassland or forest fires, sea salt from ocean wave spray, soot from factory smokestacks or internal combustion engines, [[sulfate]] from [[volcanic]] activity, [[phytoplankton]] or the oxidation of [[sulfur dioxide]] and secondary organic matter formed by the oxidation of [[volatile organic compounds]]. The ability of these different types of particles to form cloud droplets varies according to their size and also their exact composition, as the [[hygroscopic]] properties of these different constituents are very different. Sulfate and sea salt, for instance, readily absorb water whereas soot, organic carbon and mineral particles do not. This is made even more complicated by the fact that many of the chemical species may be mixed within the particles (in particular the sulfate and organic carbon). Additionally, while some particles (such as soot and minerals) do not make very good CCN, they do act as [[ice nuclei]] in colder parts of the atmosphere.{{Citation needed|reason=Is there experimental data to back up this claim?|date=November 2017}}

The number and type of CCNs can affect the precipitation amount&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khain|first1=A.

There is also speculation that [[solar variation]] may affect cloud properties via CCNs, and hence [[Cosmic rays#Role in climate change|affect climate]].

==Phytoplankton role==
{{main|CLAW hypothesis}}
Sulfate aerosol (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and [[methanesulfonic acid]] droplets) act as CCNs. These sulfate aerosols form partly from the [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS) produced by phytoplankton in the open ocean. Large [[algal bloom]]s in ocean surface waters occur in a wide range of latitudes and contribute considerable DMS into the atmosphere to act as nuclei. The idea that an increase in global temperature would also increase phytoplankton activity and therefore CCN numbers was seen as a possible natural phenomenon that would counteract [[climate change]]. An increase of phytoplankton has been observed by scientists in certain areas but the causes are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2004/268/m268p031.pdf|title=Marine Ecology Progress Series 268:31&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=int-res.com|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v157/p39-52/|title=Inter Research » MEPS » v157 » p39-52|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A counter-hypothesis is advanced in ''[[The Revenge of Gaia]]'', the book by [[James Lovelock]]. Warming oceans are likely to become [[Stratification (water)|stratified]], with most ocean nutrients trapped in the cold bottom layers while most of the light needed for [[photosynthesis]] in the warm top layer. Under this scenario, deprived of nutrients, marine phytoplankton would decline, as would sulfate cloud condensation nuclei, and the high [[albedo]] associated with low clouds. This is known as the CLAW hypothesis &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmosphere.mpg.de/enid/d9c96c048fb91779d24aedea85192a99,0/3__Gases_from_phytoplankton/-_GAIA_and_CLAW_1w1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128202811/http://www.atmosphere.mpg.de/enid/d9c96c048fb91779d24aedea85192a99%2C0/3__Gases_from_phytoplankton/-_GAIA_and_CLAW_1w1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 January 2007 |title=- GAIA and CLAW |publisher= |accessdate=25 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (named after the authors' initials of a 1987 ''Nature'' paper) but no conclusive evidence to support this has yet been reported.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26371">In [[mathematics]], a '''complex reflection group''' is a [[Group (mathematics)|finite group]] acting on a [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] [[complex numbers|complex]] [[vector space]] that is generated by '''complex reflections''': non-trivial elements that fix a complex [[hyperplane]] pointwise.

Complex reflection groups arise in the study of the [[invariant theory]] of [[polynomial ring]]s.  In the mid-20th century, they were completely classified in work of Shephard and Todd.  Special cases include the [[symmetric group]] of permutations, the [[dihedral group]]s, and more generally all finite real reflection groups (the [[Coxeter group]]s or [[Weyl group]]s, including the symmetry groups of [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]]).

==Definition==

A '''(complex) reflection''' ''r'' (sometimes also called '''pseudo reflection''' or '''unitary reflection''') of a finite-dimensional complex vector space ''V'' is an element &lt;math&gt;r \in GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; of finite order that fixes a complex hyperplane pointwise. I.e., the '''fixed-space''' &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Fix}(r) := \operatorname{ker}(r-\operatorname{Id}_V)&lt;/math&gt; has codimension 1.

A ('''finite''') '''complex reflection group''' &lt;math&gt;W \subseteq GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite subgroup of &lt;math&gt;GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; that is generated by reflections.

==Properties==

Any real reflection group becomes a complex reflection group if we extend the scalars from 
'''R''' to '''C'''. In particular all [[Coxeter group]]s or [[Weyl group]]s give examples of complex reflection groups.

A complex reflection group ''W'' is '''irreducible''' if the only ''W''-invariant proper subspace of the corresponding vector space is the origin. In this case, the dimension of the vector space is called the '''rank''' of ''W''.

The '''Coxeter number''' &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; of an irreducible complex reflection group ''W'' of rank &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;h = \frac{|\mathcal{R}|+|\mathcal{A}|}{n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of reflections and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of reflecting hyperplanes.
In the case of real reflection groups, this definition reduces to the usual definition of the Coxeter number for finite Coxeter systems.

==Classification==

Any complex reflection group is a product of irreducible complex reflection groups, acting on the sum of the corresponding vector spaces. So it is sufficient to classify the irreducible complex reflection groups.

The irreducible complex reflection groups were classified by  {{Harvs |txt |first=G. C. |last=Shephard |author1-link=Geoffrey Colin Shephard|first2=J. A. |last2=Todd |author2-link=J. A. Todd |year=1954}}. They found an infinite family ''G''(''m'',''p'',''n'') depending on 3 positive integer parameters (with ''p'' dividing ''m''), and 34 exceptional cases, that they numbered from 4 to 37, listed below. The group
''G''(''m'',''p'',''n''), of order ''m''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''n''!/''p'', is the semidirect product of the abelian group
of order ''m''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/''p'' whose elements are  (θ&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,θ&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ...,θ&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), by the symmetric group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; acting by permutations of the coordinates, where θ is a primitive ''m''th root of unity and Σ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;≡ 0 mod ''p''; it is an index ''p'' subgroup of the [[generalized symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S(m,n).&lt;/math&gt;

Special cases of ''G''(''m'',''p'',''n''):
*''G''(1,1,''n'') is the [[Coxeter group#Properties|Coxeter group]] ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {3,3,...,3,3] = {{CDD|node|3|node|3}}...{{CDD|3|node|3|node}}.
*''G''(2,1,''n'') is the Coxeter group ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = [3,3,...,3,4] = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = {{CDD|node|3|node|3}}...{{CDD|3|node|4|node}}.
*''G''(2,2,''n'') is the Coxeter group ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = [3,3,...,3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node|3|node|3}}...{{CDD|3|node|split1|nodes}}.
*''G''(''m'',''p'',1) is a cyclic group of order ''m''/''p'' = [''m''/''p'']&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
*''G''(''p'',''p'',2) is the Coxeter group ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') = [''p''] = {{CDD|branch|labelp}} (and the Weyl group ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when ''p'' = 6).
*''G''(''p'',1,''n'') is the Shephard group {{CDD|node|3|node|3}}...{{CDD|3|node|4|pnode}}.
*The group ''G''(''m'',''p'',''n'') acts irreducibly on '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; except in the cases ''m''=1, ''n''&gt;1 (symmetric group) and ''G''(2,2,2) (Klein 4 group), when '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; splits as a sum of irreducible representations of dimensions 1 and ''n''&amp;minus;1.
*The only cases when two groups ''G''(''m'',''p'',''n'') are isomorphic as complex reflection groups are that ''G''(''ma'',''pa'',1) is isomorphic to ''G''(''mb'',''pb'',1) for any positive integers ''a'',''b''. However, there are other cases when two such groups are isomorphic as abstract groups.
*The complex reflection group ''G''(2,2,3) is isomorphic as a complex reflection group to ''G''(1,1,4) restricted to a 3-dimensional space.
*The complex reflection group ''G''(3,3,2) is isomorphic as a complex reflection group to ''G''(1,1,3) restricted to a 2-dimensional space.
*The complex reflection group ''G''(2''p'',''p'',1) is isomorphic as a complex reflection group to ''G''(1,1,2) restricted to a 1-dimensional space.

==List of irreducible complex reflection groups==
There are a few duplicates in the first 3 lines of this list; see the previous section for details.
*'''ST''' is the Shephard&amp;ndash;Todd number of the reflection group.
*'''Rank''' is the dimension of the complex vector space the group acts on.
*'''Structure''' describes the structure of the group. The symbol * stands for a [[central product]] of two groups. For rank 2, the quotient by the (cyclic) center is the group of rotations of a tetrahedron, octahedron, or icosahedron (''T'' = Alt(4), ''O'' = Sym(4), ''I'' = Alt(5), of orders 12, 24, 60), as stated in the table. For the notation 2&lt;sup&gt;1+4&lt;/sup&gt;, see [[extra special group]].
*'''Order''' is the number of elements of the group.
*'''Reflections''' describes the number of reflections: 2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; means that there are 6 reflections of order 2 and 12 of order 4.
*'''Degrees''' gives the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the ring of polynomial invariants. For example, the invariants of group number 4 form a polynomial ring with 2 generators of degrees 4 and 6.

==Degrees==

Shephard and  Todd proved that a finite group acting on a complex vector space is a complex reflection group if and only if its ring of invariants is a polynomial ring ([[Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem]]). For &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; being the ''rank'' of the reflection group, the degrees &lt;math&gt;d_1 \leq d_2 \leq \ldots \leq d_\ell&lt;/math&gt; of the generators of the ring of invariants are called ''degrees of W'' and are listed in the column above headed "degrees". They also showed that many other invariants of the group are determined by the degrees as follows:

*The center of an irreducible reflection group is cyclic of order equal to the greatest common divisor of the degrees.
*The order of a complex reflection group is the product of its degrees.
*The number of reflections is the sum of the degrees minus the rank.
*An irreducible complex reflection group comes from a real reflection group if and only if it has an invariant of degree 2.
*The degrees ''d''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy the formula &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^\ell(q+d_i-1)= \sum_{w\in W}q^{\dim(V^w)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Codegrees==

For &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; being the ''rank'' of the reflection group, the codegrees &lt;math&gt;d^*_1 \geq d^*_2 \geq \ldots \geq d^*_\ell&lt;/math&gt; of W can be defined by
&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^\ell(q-d^*_i-1)= \sum_{w\in W}\det(w)q^{\dim(V^w)}.&lt;/math&gt;

*For a real reflection group, the codegrees are the degrees minus 2.
*The number of reflection hyperplanes is the sum of the codegrees plus the rank.

==Well-generated complex reflection groups==

By definition, every complex reflection group is generated by its reflections.  The set of reflections is not a minimal generating set, however, and every irreducible complex reflection groups of rank {{math|''n''}} has a minimal generating set consisting of either {{math|''n''}} or {{math|''n'' + 1}} reflections.  In the former case, the group is said to be ''well-generated''.

The property of being well-generated is equivalent to the condition &lt;math&gt;d_i + d^*_i = d_\ell&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq \ell&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, for example, one can read off from the classification that the group {{math|''G''(''m'', ''p'', ''n'')}} is well-generated if and only if ''p'' = 1 or ''m''.

For irreducible well-generated complex reflection groups, the ''[[Coxeter number]]'' {{math|''h''}} defined above equals the largest degree, &lt;math&gt;h = d_\ell&lt;/math&gt;. A reducible complex reflection group is said to be well-generated if it is a product of irreducible well-generated complex reflection groups. Every finite real reflection group is well-generated.

==Shephard groups==

The well-generated complex reflection groups include a subset called the ''Shephard groups''.  These groups are the symmetry groups of [[regular complex polytope]]s.  In particular, they include the symmetry groups of regular real polyhedra.  The Shephard groups may be characterized as the complex reflection groups that admit a "Coxeter-like" presentation with a linear diagram.  That is, a Shephard group has associated positive integers {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that there is a generating set {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} satisfying the relations
: &lt;math&gt;(s_i)^{p_i} = 1&lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, …, ''n''}},
: &lt;math&gt; s_i s_j = s_j s_i&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;|i - j| &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, 
and
: &lt;math&gt; s_i s_{i + 1}s_i s_{i + 1} \cdots = s_{i + 1}s_i s_{i + 1}s_i \cdots&lt;/math&gt; where the products on both sides have {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} terms, for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, …, ''n'' − 1}}.

This information is sometimes collected in the Coxeter-type symbol {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] … [''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;]''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, as seen in the table above.

Among groups in the infinite family {{math|''G''(''m'', ''p'', ''n'')}}, the Shephard groups are those in which {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}}.  There are also 18 exceptional Shephard groups, of which three are real.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Orlik]], Victor Reiner, Anne V. Shepler. ''The sign representation for Shephard groups''. ''Mathematische Annalen''. March 2002, Volume 322, Issue 3, pp 477–492. DOI:10.1007/s002080200001 [http://www.math.unt.edu/~ashepler/papers/ORS.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|Coxeter, H. S. M.]]; ''Regular Complex Polytopes'', Cambridge University Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cartan matrices ==
An extended [[Cartan matrix]] defines the Unitary group. Shephard groups of rank ''n'' group have ''n'' generators.

Ordinary Cartan matrices have diagonal elements 2, while unitary reflections do not have this restriction.&lt;ref&gt;Unitary Reflection Groups, pp.91-93&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the rank 1 group, p[], {{CDD|pnode}}, is defined by a 1×1 matrix [1-&lt;math&gt;e^{2\pi i/p}&lt;/math&gt;].

Given: &lt;math&gt;\zeta_p = e^{2\pi i/p}, \omega \ \zeta_3 = e^{2\pi i/3} = \tfrac{1}{2}(-1+i\sqrt{3}), \zeta_4 = e^{2\pi i/4} = i, \zeta_5 = e^{2\pi i/5} = \tfrac{1}{4}(\left(\sqrt5-1\right) + i\sqrt{2(5+\sqrt5)}), \tau = \tfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}, \lambda = \tfrac{1+i\sqrt7}{2}, \omega = \tfrac{-1+i\sqrt3}{2} &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Cordtex''' is a type of [[detonating cord]] generally used in [[mining]]. It uses an [[explosive core]] of [[PETN|pentaerythritol tetranitrate]] (PETN) inside its plastic coating. 

It is commonly the thickness of electrical [[extension cord]] and has a velocity of detonation of approximately 6000–7000 metres per second.  It is used to "[[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisychain]]" a sequence of explosives together.

It can also be used in short lengths in simple [[boobytraps]] and early warning devices.

'''Cryochemistry''' is the study of chemical interactions at [[temperature]]s below {{convert|-150|°C|F K}}.{{citation-needed|date=November 2015}} It is derived from the Greek word ''cryos'', meaning 'cold'. It overlaps with many other sciences, including [[chemistry]], [[cryobiology]], [[condensed matter physics]], and even [[astrochemistry]].
 
Cryochemistry has been a topic of interest since [[liquid nitrogen]], which freezes at −210°C, became commonly available.{{when|date=November 2015}} [[Cryogenic]]-temperature chemical interactions are an important mechanism for studying the detailed pathways of chemical reactions by reducing the confusion introduced by thermal fluctuations. Cryochemistry forms the foundation for [[cryobiology]], which uses slowed or stopped biological processes for medical and research purposes.

==Low temperature behaviours==
[[File:2 Helium.png|thumb|When cooled below the [[Lambda point]] ({{convert|2.17|K|C|disp=or}} at 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]), [[liquid helium]] exhibits properties of [[superfluidity]]]]
As a material cools, the relative motion of its component molecules/atoms decreases - its temperature decreases.  Cooling can continue until all motion ceases, and its [[kinetic energy]], or energy of motion, disappears. This condition is known as [[absolute zero]] and it forms the basis for the [[Kelvin]] [[scale of temperature|temperature scale]], which measures the temperature above absolute zero. Zero degrees Celsius (°C) coincides with 273 Kelvin.

At absolute zero most elements become a solid, but not all behave as predictably as this; for instance, helium becomes a [[liquid helium|highly unusual liquid]]. The chemistry between substances, however, does not disappear, even near absolute zero temperatures, since separated molecules/atom can always combine to lower their total energy. Almost every molecule or element will show different properties at different temperatures; if cold enough, some functions are lost entirely. Cryogenic chemistry can lead to very different results compared with standard chemistry, and new chemical routes to substances may be available at cryogenic temperatures, such as the formation of [[argon fluorohydride]], which is only a stable compound at or below {{convert|17|K|C}}.

==Methods of cooling==
{{see also|Laser cooling}}
One method that used to cool molecules to temperatures near absolute zero is [[laser cooling]]. In the [[Doppler cooling]] process, lasers are used to remove energy from electrons of a given molecule to slow or cool the molecule down. This method has applications in [[quantum mechanics]] and is related to particle traps and the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. All of these methods use a "trap" consisting of lasers pointed at opposite equatorial angles on a specific point in space. The wavelengths from the laser beams eventually hit the gaseous atoms and their outer spinning electrons. This clash of wavelengths decreases the kinetic energy state fraction by fraction to slow or cool the molecules down. Laser cooling has also been used to help improve atomic clocks and atom optics.  Ultracold studies are not usually focused on chemical interactions, but rather on fundamental chemical properties.{{citation-needed|date=November 2015}}

Because of the extremely low temperatures, diagnosing the chemical status is a major issue when studying low temperature physics and chemistry.{{clarify|date=November 2015}} The primary techniques in use today are optical - many types of spectroscopy are available, but these require special apparatus with vacuum windows that provide room temperature access to cryogenic processes.

References in progress:
"Cryocooling" and cold storage is currently a major commercial application of cryochemistry. Materials are preserved when cold because the biological processes of degradation are slowed or stopped.  Cryotreatment of materials is also more and more widely used to alter important material properties such as hardness, or even the sound of musical instruments. Cryochemistry is of crucial importance in advanced chemical rocket propellants.

{{short description|The process in which organic substances are broken down into simpler organic matter}}
{{Signs of death}}
[[File:Berge naturreservat omkullfallet liten tall.jpg|thumb|Decomposing fallen [[nurse log]] in a forest]]
'''Decomposition''' is the process by which [[organic substance]]s are broken down into a more simple organic matter. The process is a part of the [[nutrient cycle]] and is essential for recycling the finite matter that occupies physical space in the [[biosphere]]. Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after [[death]]. Animals, such as worms, also help decompose the organic materials. Organisms that do this are known as [[decomposer]]s. Although no two organisms decompose in the same way, they all undergo the same sequential stages of decomposition. The science which studies decomposition is generally referred to as  ''[[taphonomy]]'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''taphos'', meaning tomb.

One can differentiate '''abiotic''' from '''biotic decomposition''' ([[biodegradation]]). The former means "degradation of a substance by [[Chemical decomposition|chemical]] or physical processes, e.g., [[hydrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Vocabulary. IShaO 6107-6:1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter means "the metabolic breakdown of materials into simpler components by living organisms",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biotic decomposition|work=Water Words Dictionary (WWD)}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically by microorganisms.

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Animal decomposition ==
[[Image:Ants cleaning dead snake.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ant]]s eating a dead [[snake]]]]
Decomposition begins at the moment of death, caused by two factors: 1.) [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]], the breaking down of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s by the body's own internal chemicals and [[enzyme]]s, and 2.) [[putrefaction]], the breakdown of tissues by [[bacteria]]. These processes release compounds such as [[cadaverine]] and [[putrescine]], that are the chief source of the unmistakably putrid [[odor]] of decaying animal tissue.

Prime decomposers are [[bacteria]] or [[fungi]], though larger [[scavenger]]s also play an important role in decomposition if the body is accessible to [[insect]]s, [[Acari|mites]] and other animals. The most important arthropods that are involved in the process include [[carrion beetle]]s, mites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=González Medina A, González Herrera L, Perotti MA, Jiménez Ríos G | title=Occurrence of ''Poecilochirus austroasiaticus'' (Acari: Parasitidae) in forensic autopsies and its application on postmortem interval estimation | journal=Exp. Appl. Acarol. | year=2013 | volume=59 | issue=3 | pages=297–305 | doi=10.1007/s10493-012-9606-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braig|first=Henk R.|author2=Perotti, M. Alejandra|title=Carcases and mites|journal=Experimental and Applied Acarology|year=2009|volume=49|issue=1–2|pages=45–84|doi=10.1007/s10493-009-9287-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[flesh-fly|flesh-flies]] (Sarcophagidae) and [[Blow-fly|blow-flies]] ([[Calliphoridae]]), such as the [[green-bottle fly]] seen in the summer. In North America, the most important non-insect animals that are typically involved in the process include mammal and bird scavengers, such as [[coyote]]s, [[dog]]s, [[Wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[rat]]s, [[crows]] and [[vulture]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Some of these scavengers also remove and scatter bones, which they ingest at a later time. Aquatic and marine environments have break-down agents that include bacteria, fish, crustaceans, [[Diptera|fly]] larvae &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=González Medina A, Soriano Hernando Ó, Jiménez Ríos G | title=The Use of the Developmental Rate of the Aquatic Midge ''Chironomus riparius'' (Diptera, Chironomidae) in the Assessment of the Postsubmersion Interval | journal=J. Forensic Sci. | year=2015 | volume=60 | issue=3 | pages=822–826 | doi=10.1111/1556-4029.12707}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other carrion scavengers.

=== Stages of decomposition ===
Five general stages are used to describe the process of decomposition in vertebrate animals: fresh, bloat, active decay, advanced decay, and dry/remains.&lt;ref name= Payne&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.2307/1934999|last= Payne|first= J.A.|title= A summer carrion study of the baby pig sus scrofa Linnaeus|journal= Ecology|volume=46|issue= 5| pages=592–602|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general stages of decomposition are coupled with two stages of chemical decomposition: [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] and [[putrefaction]].&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbes | first=S.L. |editor= M. Tibbett |editor2=D.O. Carter |title=Soil Analysis in Forensic Taphonomy|publisher=CRC Press |year=2008 |pages=203–223 |chapter=Decomposition Chemistry in a Burial Environment |isbn=1-4200-6991-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two stages contribute to the [[chemical process of decomposition]], which breaks down the main components of the body. With death the microbiome of the living organism collapses and is followed by the [[necrobiome]] that undergoes predictable changes over time.

==== Fresh ====
Among those animals that have a heart, the "fresh" stage begins immediately after the heart stops beating. From the moment of death, the body begins cooling or warming to match the temperature of the ambient environment, during a stage called [[rigor mortis]].&lt;ref name=Janaway&gt;{{cite book |author=Janaway R.C., Percival S.L., Wilson A.S. | editor-first=S.L.| editor-last= Percival |title=Microbiology and Aging| publisher=Springer Science + Business |year=2009 |pages=13–334 |chapter=Decomposition of Human Remains |isbn= 1-58829-640-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after death, within three to six hours, the muscular tissues become rigid and incapable of relaxing, during a stage called [[rigor mortis]]. Since blood is no longer being pumped through the body, [[gravity]] causes it to drain to the [[dependent portions of the body]], creating an overall bluish-purple discolouration termed [[livor mortis]] or, more commonly, lividity.

Once the heart stops, the [[blood]] can no longer supply [[oxygen]] or remove [[carbon dioxide]] from the tissues. The resulting decrease in pH and other chemical changes causes cells to lose their [[structural integrity]], bringing about the release of cellular enzymes capable of initiating the breakdown of surrounding cells and tissues. This process is known as [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]].

Visible changes caused by decomposition are limited during the fresh stage, although autolysis may cause blisters to appear at the surface of the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Bernard |title= [[Forensic pathology]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-19-520903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small amount of oxygen remaining in the body is quickly depleted by cellular [[metabolism]] and [[aerobic organism|aerobic microbes]] naturally present in [[respiratory tract|respiratory]] and [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] tracts, creating an ideal environment for the proliferation of [[anaerobic organism]]s. These multiply, consuming the body's [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s, to produce a variety of substances including [[propionic acid]], [[lactic acid]], [[methane]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], and [[ammonia]]. The process of microbial proliferation within a body is referred to as [[putrefaction]] and leads to the second stage of decomposition, known as bloat.&lt;ref name= Carterjournal&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Carter D.O., Yellowlees |author2=D., Tibbett M. |title= Cadaver decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems|journal= Naturwissenschaften|volume= 94|issue= 1|pages= 12–24|year=2007|pmid= 17091303|doi=10.1007/s00114-006-0159-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Calliphoridae|Blowflies]] and [[Flesh-fly|flesh flies]] are the first carrion insects to arrive, and they seek a suitable [[oviposition]] site.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt;

==== {{anchor|Bloat|bloat|Bloat stage|Bloated|bloated|bloating|Bloating}} Bloat ====
The bloat stage provides the first clear visual sign that microbial proliferation is underway. In this stage, anaerobic metabolism takes place, leading to the accumulation of gases, such as [[hydrogen sulphide|hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], and [[nitrogen]]. The accumulation of gases within the bodily cavity causes the distention of the abdomen and gives a cadaver its overall bloated appearance.&lt;ref name= Carterbook&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carter D.O. |author2=Tibbett M. |editor1=M. Tibbett |editor2=D.O. Carter |title=Soil Analysis in Forensic Taphonomy|publisher=CRC Press |year=2008 |pages=29–51 |chapter=Cadaver Decomposition and Soil: Processes |isbn=1-4200-6991-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gases produced also cause natural liquids and liquefying tissues to become frothy.&lt;ref name= Janaway/&gt;  As the pressure of the gases within the body increases, fluids are forced to escape from natural orifices, such as the nose, mouth, and anus, and enter the surrounding environment.  The buildup of pressure combined with the loss of integrity of the skin may also cause the body to rupture.&lt;ref name= Carterbook/&gt;

Intestinal anaerobic bacteria transform [[haemoglobin]] into [[sulfhemoglobin]] and other colored pigments.  The associated gases which accumulate within the body at this time aid in the transport of sulfhemoglobin throughout the body via the [[Circulatory system|circulatory]] and [[lymphatic system]]s, giving the body an overall marbled appearance.&lt;ref name= Pinheiro&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinheiro|first=J.|editor= A. Schmidt |editor2=E. Cumha |editor3=J. Pinheiro|title= Forensic Anthropology and Medicine|publisher= Humana Press|year=2006|pages= 85–116|chapter= Decay Process of a Cadaver|isbn=1-58829-824-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If insects have access, [[maggot]]s hatch and begin to feed on the body's tissues.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;  Maggot activity, typically confined to natural orifices, and masses under the skin, causes the skin to slip, and hair to detach from the skin.&lt;ref name= Janaway/&gt;  Maggot feeding, and the accumulation of gases within the body, eventually leads to post-mortem skin ruptures which will then further allow purging of gases and fluids into the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name= Carterjournal/&gt;  Ruptures in the skin allow oxygen to re-enter the body and provide more surface area for the development of fly larvae and the activity of aerobic microorganisms.&lt;ref name= Carterbook/&gt;  The purging of gases and fluids results in the strong distinctive odors associated with decay.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;

==== Active decay ====
Active decay is characterized by the period of greatest mass loss. This loss occurs as a result of both the voracious feeding of maggots and the purging of decomposition fluids into the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name= Carterbook/&gt;  The purged fluids accumulate around the body and create a cadaver decomposition island (CDI).  Liquefaction of tissues and disintegration become apparent during this time and strong odors persist.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;  The end of active decay is signaled by the migration of maggots away from the body to pupate.&lt;ref name= Carterjournal/&gt;

==== Advanced decay ====
Decomposition is largely inhibited during advanced decay due to the loss of readily available cadaveric material.&lt;ref name= Carterbook/&gt;  Insect activity is also reduced during this stage.&lt;ref name= Janaway/&gt;  When the carcass is located on soil, the area surrounding it will show evidence of [[vegetation]] death.&lt;ref name= Carterbook/&gt;  The CDI surrounding the carcass will display an increase in soil carbon and nutrients, such as [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], and [[magnesium]];&lt;ref name= Carterjournal/&gt; changes in pH; and a significant increase in soil [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref name= Vass&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vass A.A. |author2=Bass W.M. |author3=volt J.D. |author4=Foss J.E. |author5=Ammons J.T. |title= Time since death determinations of human cadavers using soil solution|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|volume=37|pages= 1236–1253|year=1992|pmid= 1402750|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dry/remains ====
During the dry/remains stage, the resurgence of plant growth around the CDI may occur and is a sign that the nutrients present in the surrounding soil have not yet returned to their normal levels.&lt;ref name= Carterbook/&gt;  All that remains of the cadaver at this stage is dry skin, [[cartilage]], and [[bone]]s,&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; which will become dry and bleached if exposed to the elements.&lt;ref name= Janaway/&gt;  If all soft tissue is removed from the cadaver, it is referred to as completely [[Skeletonization (forensics)|skeletonized]], but if only portions of the bones are exposed, it is referred to as partially skeletonised.&lt;ref name=Dent&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dent B.B. |author2=Forbes S.L. |author3=Stuart B.H. |title= Review of human decomposition processes in soil|journal=Environmental Geology|volume=45| pages=576–585| doi = 10.1007/s00254-003-0913-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors affecting decomposition of bodies ==
{{Further|Environmental effects on forensic entomology}}
{{more citations needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Exposure to the elements ===
A dead body that has been exposed to the open elements, such as water and air, will decompose more quickly and attract much more [[insect]] activity than a body that is buried or confined in special protective gear or artifacts. This is due, in part, to the limited number of insects that can penetrate a coffin and the lower temperatures under soil.

The rate and manner of decomposition in an animal body is strongly affected by several factors. In roughly descending degrees of importance, they are:
* [[Temperature]];
* The availability of [[oxygen]];
* Prior [[embalming]];
* [[List of causes of death by rate|Cause of death]];
* [[Burial]], depth of burial, and soil type;
* Access by [[scavenger]]s;
* [[Physical trauma|Trauma]], including [[wound]]s and crushing blows;
* [[Humidity]], or wetness;
* [[Rain]]fall;
* Body size and weight;
* [[Clothing]];
* The surface on which the body rests;
* Foods/objects inside the specimen's [[digestive tract]] (bacon compared to lettuce).

The speed at which decomposition occurs varies greatly. Factors such as temperature, humidity, and the season of death all determine how fast a fresh body will skeletonize or mummify. A basic guide for the effect of environment on decomposition is given as Casper's Law (or Ratio): if all other factors are equal, then, when there is free access of air a body decomposes twice as fast than if immersed in water and eight times faster than if buried in earth. Ultimately, the rate of bacterial decomposition acting on the tissue will depend upon the temperature of the surroundings. Colder temperatures decrease the rate of decomposition while warmer temperatures increase it. A dry body will not decompose efficiently. Moisture helps the growth of microorganisms that decompose the organic matter, but too much moisture could lead to anaerobic conditions slowing down the decomposition process.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/earthkind/landscape/dont-bag-it/chapter-1-the-decomposition-process/|title=Chapter 1, The Decomposition Process {{!}}  Earth-Kind® Landscaping|website=aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important variable is a body's accessibility to insects, particularly flies. On the surface in tropical areas, invertebrates alone can easily reduce a fully fleshed corpse to clean bones in under two weeks. The skeleton itself is not permanent; [[acid]]s in [[soil]]s can reduce it to unrecognizable components. This is one reason given for the lack of human remains found in the wreckage of the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']], even in parts of the ship considered inaccessible to scavengers. Freshly skeletonized bone is often called "green" bone and has a characteristic greasy feel. Under certain conditions (normally cool, damp soil), bodies may undergo [[saponification]] and develop a waxy substance called [[adipocere]], caused by the action of soil chemicals on the body's [[protein]]s and [[fat]]s. The formation of adipocere slows decomposition by inhibiting the bacteria that cause putrefaction.

In extremely dry or cold conditions, the normal process of decomposition is halted&amp;nbsp;– by either lack of moisture or temperature controls on bacterial and enzymatic action&amp;nbsp;– causing the body to be preserved as a [[mummy]]. Frozen mummies commonly restart the decomposition process when thawed (see [[Ötzi the Iceman]]), whilst heat-desiccated mummies remain so unless exposed to moisture.

The bodies of newborns who never ingested food are an important exception to the normal process of decomposition. They lack the internal microbial flora that produce much of decomposition and quite commonly mummify if kept in even moderately dry conditions.

=== Anaerobic vs Aerobic ===
Aerobic decomposition takes place in the presence of oxygen. This is most common to occur in nature. Living organisms that use oxygen to survive feed on the body. Anaerobic decomposition takes place in the absence of oxygen. This could be place where the body is buried in organic material and oxygen can not reach it. This process of putrefaction has a bad odor accompanied by it due to the hydrogen sulfide and organic matter containing sulfur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Artificial preservation  ===
[[Embalming]] is the practice of delaying decomposition of human and animal remains. Embalming slows decomposition somewhat, but does not forestall it indefinitely. Embalmers typically pay great attention to parts of the body seen by mourners, such as the face and hands. The chemicals used in embalming repel most insects, and slow down bacterial putrefaction by either killing existing bacteria in or on the body themselves or by "fixing" cellular proteins, which means that they cannot act as a nutrient source for subsequent bacterial infections. In sufficiently dry environments, an embalmed body may end up [[mummy|mummified]] and it is not uncommon for bodies to remain preserved to a viewable extent after decades. Notable viewable embalmed bodies include those of:
* [[Eva Perón]] of [[Argentina]], whose body was injected with [[paraffin wax|paraffin]] was kept perfectly preserved for many years, and still is as far as is known (her body is no longer on public display).
* [[Vladimir Lenin]] of the [[Soviet Union]], whose body was kept submerged in a special tank of fluid for decades and is on public display in [[Lenin's Mausoleum]].
** Other [[Communist]] leaders with pronounced [[cults of personality]] such as [[Mao Zedong]], [[Kim Il-sung]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], [[Kim Jong-il]] and most recently [[Hugo Chávez]] have also had their cadavers preserved in the fashion of Lenin's preservation and are now displayed in their respective mausoleums.
* [[Pope John XXIII]], whose preserved body can be viewed in [[St. Peter's Basilica]].
* [[Padre Pio]], whose body was injected with [[formalin]] prior to burial in a dry vault{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} from which he was later removed and placed on public display at the [[San Giovanni Rotondo]].

=== Environmental preservation ===
A body buried in a sufficiently dry environment may be well preserved for decades. This was observed in the case for murdered [[civil rights]] activist [[Medgar Evers]], who was found to be almost perfectly preserved over 30 years after his death, permitting an accurate [[autopsy]] when the case of his murder was re-opened in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Quigley | first=C. | title=Modern Mummies: The Preservation of the Human Body in the Twentieth Century | publisher=McFarland | year=1998 | pages=213–214 | isbn=0-7864-0492-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodies submerged in a [[peat]] [[bog]] may become naturally "embalmed", arresting decomposition and resulting in a preserved specimen known as a [[bog body]]. The time for an embalmed body to be reduced to a [[skeleton]] varies greatly. Even when a body is decomposed, embalming treatment can still be achieved (the arterial system decays more slowly) but would not restore a natural appearance without extensive reconstruction and cosmetic work, and is largely used to control the foul odors due to decomposition.

An animal can be preserved almost perfectly, for millions of years in a resin such as amber.

There are some examples where bodies have been inexplicably preserved (with no human intervention) for decades or centuries and appear almost the same as when they died. In some religious groups, this is known as [[incorruptibility]]. It is not known whether or for how long a body can stay free of decay without artificial preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/incorruptible.htm |title=How can a corpse be incorruptible? |first=Josh |last=Clark |publisher=HowStuffWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance to forensic sciences ===
{{Further|Forensic entomological decomposition}}

Various sciences study the decomposition of bodies under the general rubric of [[forensic science]] because the usual motive for such studies is to determine the time and cause of death for [[law|legal]] purposes:
* Forensic taphonomy specifically studies the processes of decomposition in order to apply the biological and chemical principles to forensic cases in order to determine [[post-mortem interval]] (PMI), post-burial interval as well as to locate clandestine graves.
* [[Forensic pathology]] studies the clues to the cause of death found in the corpse as a [[medicine|medical]] phenomenon.
* [[Forensic entomology]] studies the insects and other [[vermin]] found in corpses; the sequence in which they appear, the kinds of insects, and where they are found in their life cycle are clues that can shed light on the time of death, the length of a corpse's exposure, and whether the corpse was moved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Smith | first=KGV. | title=A Manual of Forensic Entomology | publisher=Cornell Univ. Pr. | year=1987 | pages=464 | isbn=0-8014-1927-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kulshrestha P, Satpathy DK | title=Use of beetles in forensic entomology | journal=Forensic Sci.

* [[Forensic anthropology]] is the medico-legal branch of [[physical anthropology]] that studies skeletons and human remains, usually to seek clues as to the identity, age, sex, height and ethnicity of their former owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Schmitt | first=A. |author2=Cunha, E.|author3=Pinheiro, J. | title=Forensic Anthropology and Medicine: Complementary Sciences From Recovery to Cause of Death | publisher=Humana Press | year=2006 | pages=464 | isbn=1-58829-824-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Haglund | first=WD. |author2=Sorg, MH. | title=Forensic Taphonomy: The Postmortem Fate of Human Remains | publisher=CRC Press | year=1996 | pages=636 | isbn=0-8493-9434-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Tennessee Anthropological Research Facility]] (better known as the Body Farm) in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] has a number of bodies laid out in various situations in a fenced-in plot near the medical center. Scientists at the [[Body Farm]] study how the human body decays in various circumstances to gain a better understanding of decomposition.

== Plant decomposition ==
{{See also|Composting|Anaerobic digestion|Fungal extracellular enzyme activity}}
[[Image:DecayingPeachSmall.gif|frame|right|A decaying peach over a period of six days. Each frame is approximately 12 hours apart, as the fruit shrivels and becomes covered with [[mold]].]]
Decomposition of plant matter occurs in many stages. It begins with leaching by water; the most easily lost and soluble carbon compounds are liberated in this process. Another early process is physical breakup or fragmentation of the plant material into smaller bits which have greater surface area for [[microbial]] colonization and attack. In smaller dead plants, this process is largely carried out by the soil invertebrate fauna, whereas in the larger plants, primarily parasitic life-forms such as insects and fungi play a major breakdown role and are not assisted by numerous [[detritivore]] species.

Following this, the plant [[detritus]] (consisting of [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], microbial products, and [[lignin]]) undergoes[[File:Decomposition of leafs .jpg|200XPpx|frameless|left|leafs decomposing after time goes on]] chemical alteration by microbes. Different types of compounds decompose at different rates. This is dependent on their [[chemical structure]].

For instance, [[lignin]] is a component of wood, which is relatively resistant to decomposition and can in fact only be decomposed by certain [[fungi]], such as the black-rot fungi. Wood decomposition is a complex process involving fungi which transport nutrients to the nutritionally scarce wood from outside environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Michał|last2=Sobczyk|first2=Łukasz|last3=Weiner|first3=January|date=2016-04-09|title=Fungal Transformation of Tree Stumps into a Suitable Resource for Xylophagous Beetles via Changes in Elemental Ratios|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/7/2/13|journal=Insects|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=13|doi=10.3390/insects7020013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this nutritional enrichment the fauna of [[Xylophagy|saproxylic]] insects may develop&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Michał|last2=Weiner|first2=January|date=2016-09-01|title=Nutritional dynamics during the development of xylophagous beetles related to changes in the stoichiometry of 11 elements|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phen.12168/abstract|doi-access=free|journal=Physiological Entomology|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/phen.12168|issn=1365-3032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in turn affect dead wood, contributing to wood decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest floor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lignin is one such remaining product of decomposing plants with a very complex chemical structure causing the rate of microbial breakdown to slow. Warmth increases the speed of plant decay, by the same amount regardless of the composition of the plant&lt;ref name="mit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chu|first1=Jennifer|title=MIT News|url=http://news.mit.edu/2012/leaf-decay-1004|website=The mathematics of leaf decay|publisher=MIT News Office|accessdate=21 July 2018|ref=scientists research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[grassland]] ecosystems, natural damage from [[fire]], insects that feed on decaying matter, [[termite]]s, [[grazing]] mammals, and the physical movement of animals through the grass are the primary agents of breakdown and [[nutrient cycling]], while bacteria and fungi play the main roles in further decomposition.

The chemical aspects of plant decomposition always involve the release of [[carbon dioxide]]. In fact, decomposition contributes over 90 percent of carbon dioxide released each year.&lt;ref name="mit"/&gt;

== Food decomposition ==
{{Main|Meat spoilage}}
{{Expand section|information from the main article|date=July 2010}}
The decomposition of food, either plant or animal, called ''spoilage'' in this context, is an important field of study within [[food science]]. Food decomposition can be slowed down by [[food conservation|conservation]]. The spoilage of meat occurs, if the meat is untreated, in a matter of hours or days and results in the meat becoming unappetizing, poisonous or infectious. Spoilage is caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent decomposition of meat by bacteria and fungi, which are borne by the animal itself, by the people handling the meat, and by their implements. Meat can be kept edible for a much longer time&amp;nbsp;– though not indefinitely&amp;nbsp;– if proper hygiene is observed during production and processing, and if appropriate food safety, food preservation and food storage procedures are applied.

Spoilage of food is attributed to contamination from microorganisms such as bacteria, molds, and yeasts, along with natural decay of the food.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food and nutrition|last=Anita|first=Tull|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-19-832766-0|location=|pages=154, 155|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decomposition bacteria reproduce at rapid rates under conditions of moisture and preferred temperatures. When the proper conditions are lacking the bacteria may form spores which lurk until suitable conditions arise to continue reproduction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Rate of decomposition==

The rate of decomposition is governed by three sets of factors—the physical environment (temperature, moisture and soil properties), the quantity and quality of the dead material available to decomposers, and the nature of the microbial community itself.&lt;ref name="Chapin159"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology|last=Chapin|first=F. Stuart|author2=Pamela A. Matson|author3=Harold A. Mooney|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-387-95443-0|location=New York|pages=159–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decomposition rates are low under very wet or very dry conditions. Decomposition rates are highest in wet, moist conditions with adequate levels of oxygen. Wet soils tend to become deficient in oxygen (this is especially true in [[wetland]]s), which slows microbial growth. In dry soils, decomposition slows as well, but bacteria continue to grow (albeit at a slower rate) even after soils become too dry to support plant growth.  When the rains return and soils become wet, the [[osmotic gradient]] between the bacterial cells and the soil water causes the cells to gain water quickly. Under these conditions, many bacterial cells burst, releasing a pulse of nutrients.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt; Decomposition rates also tend to be slower in acidic soils.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt; Soils which are rich in [[clay minerals]] tend to have lower decomposition rates, and thus, higher levels of organic matter.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt; The smaller particles of clay result in a larger surface area that can hold water. The higher the water content of a soil, the lower the oxygen content&lt;ref name="Chapin61"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology|last=Chapin|first=F. Stuart|author2=Pamela A. Matson|author3=Harold A. Mooney|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-387-95443-0|location=New York|pages=61–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently, the lower the rate of decomposition. Clay minerals also bind particles of organic material to their surface, making them less accessible to microbes.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt; Soil disturbance like [[tillage|tilling]] increases decomposition by increasing the amount of oxygen in the soil and by exposing new organic matter to soil microbes.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt;

The quality and quantity of the material available to decomposers is another major factor that influences the rate of decomposition. Substances like sugars and amino acids decompose readily and are considered labile. [[Cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]], which are broken down more slowly, are "moderately labile". Compounds which are more resistant to decay, like lignin or [[cutin]], are considered recalcitrant.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt; Litter with a higher proportion of labile compounds decomposes much more rapidly than does litter with a higher proportion of recalcitrant material. Consequently, dead animals decompose more rapidly than dead leaves, which themselves decompose more rapidly than fallen branches.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt; As organic material in the soil ages, its quality decreases. The more labile compounds decompose quickly, leaving an increasing proportion of recalcitrant material. Microbial cell walls also contain recalcitrant materials like [[chitin]], and these also accumulate as the microbes die, further reducing the quality of older [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Electrolysis Apparatus.png|thumb|Illustration of an electrolysis apparatus used in a school laboratory.]]
In [[chemistry]] and [[manufacturing]], '''electrolysis''' is a technique that uses a [[Direct current|direct]] [[electric current]] (DC) to drive an otherwise non-spontaneous chemical reaction. Electrolysis is commercially important as a stage in the [[#Industrial uses|separation]] of [[chemical element|elements]] from naturally occurring sources such as [[ores]] using an [[electrolytic cell]]. The [[voltage]] that is needed for electrolysis to occur is called the [[decomposition potential]].

==History==
The word "electrolysis" was introduced by [[Michael Faraday]] in the 19th century, on the suggestion of the Rev. [[William Whewell]], using the [[Greek language|Greek]] words {{lang|grc|ἤλεκτρον}} {{IPA-el|ɛ̌ːlektron|}} "amber", which since the 17th century was associated with [[electricity|electric phenomena]], and ''{{lang|grc|λύσις}}'' {{IPA-el|lýsis|}} meaning "dissolution". Nevertheless, electrolysis, as a tool to study chemical reactions and obtain pure [[chemical element|elements]], precedes the coinage of the term and formal description by Faraday.
* 1785 – [[Martinus van Marum]]'s electrostatic generator was used to reduce [[tin]], [[zinc]], and [[antimony]] from their salts using electrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;The Supplement (1803 edition) to Encyclopædia Britannica 3rd edition (1797), volume 1, page 225, "Mister Van Marum, by means of his great electrical machine, decomposed the calces of tin, zinc, and antimony, and resolved them into their respective metals and oxygen" and gives as a reference Journal de Physiques, 1785.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1800 – [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] and [[Anthony Carlisle]] (view also [[Johann Ritter]]), decomposed [[water]] into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]].
* 1808 – [[Potassium]] (1807), [[sodium]] (1807), [[barium]], [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] were discovered by [[Sir Humphry Davy#Electrolysis|Sir Humphry Davy]] using electrolysis.

==Overview==
Electrolysis is the passing of a [[Direct current|direct]] [[electric current]] through an [[ion]]ic substance that is either molten or dissolved in a suitable solvent, producing chemical reactions at the electrodes and a separation of the materials.

The main components required to achieve electrolysis are:
* An [[electrolyte]]: a [[Chemical substance|substance]], frequently an ion-conducting [[polymer]] that contains free [[ion]]s, which carry [[electric current]] in the [[electrolyte]].  If the [[ion]]s are not mobile, as in most solid [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, then electrolysis cannot occur.
* A [[direct current]] (DC) electrical supply: provides the [[energy]] necessary to create or discharge the [[ion]]s in the [[electrolyte]]. Electric current is carried by [[electron]]s in the external circuit.
* Two [[electrode]]s: [[electrical conductor]]s that provide the physical interface between the [[electrolyte]] and the [[electrical circuit]] that provides the [[energy]].

Electrodes of [[metal]], [[graphite]] and [[semiconductor]] material are widely used. Choice of suitable electrode depends on chemical reactivity between the electrode and electrolyte and manufacturing cost.

===Process of electrolysis===
The key process of electrolysis is the interchange of atoms and ions by the removal or addition of electrons from the external circuit. The desired products of electrolysis are often in a different physical state from the electrolyte and can be removed by some physical processes. For example, in the electrolysis of [[brine]] to produce hydrogen and chlorine, the products are gaseous. These gaseous products bubble from the electrolyte and are collected.&lt;ref name="Tilley2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tilley, R. J. D. |title=Understanding solids: the science of materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFZ0guoKD1QC&amp;pg=PA281|accessdate=22 October 2011|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-85276-7|pages=281–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 NaCl + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 NaOH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

A liquid containing electrolyte is produced by:
* [[Solvation]] or reaction of an [[ionic compound]] with a [[solvent]] (such as water) to produce mobile ions
* An ionic compound is melted by heating

An electrical potential is applied across a pair of [[electrode]]s immersed in the electrolyte. &lt;!--
Many people misunderstand these definitions and think they should be the other way round. Please read the [[electrode]] article before trying to 'correct' them. Also see the [[anode]] and [[cathode]] articles. The definition is: "The anode is now defined as the electrode at which electrons leave the cell and oxidation occurs, and the cathode as the electrode at which electrons enter the cell and reduction occurs." For electrolysis, this means the anode is the positive electrode and the cathode is the negative electrode. The positively-charged ions move towards the negative electrode, the cathode. The negatively-charged ions move towards the positive electrode, the anode. --&gt;

Each electrode attracts ions that are of the opposite [[Electric charge|charge]]. Positively charged ions ([[cation]]s) move towards the electron-providing (negative) cathode. Negatively charged ions ([[anion]]s) move towards the electron-extracting (positive) anode.

In this process [[electron]]s are either absorbed or released. Neutral atoms gain or lose electrons and become charged ions that then pass into the electrolyte. The formation of uncharged atoms from ions is called discharging. When an ion gains or loses enough electrons to become uncharged (neutral) atoms, the newly formed atoms separate from the electrolyte. Positive metal ions like Cu&lt;sup&gt;++  &lt;/sup&gt;deposit onto the cathode in a layer. The terms for this are [[electroplating]], [[electrowinning]], and [[electrorefining]].  When an ion gains or loses electrons without becoming neutral, its electronic charge is altered in the process. In chemistry, the loss of electrons is called [[Oxidation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, while electron gain is called reduction.

===Oxidation and reduction at the electrodes===
[[Oxidation]] of ions or neutral molecules occurs at the [[anode]]. For example, it is possible to oxidize ferrous ions to ferric ions at the anode:
: Fe{{su|p = 2+}}(aq) → Fe{{su|p = 3+}}(aq) + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
[[Redox|Reduction]] of ions or neutral molecules occurs at the [[cathode]].

It is possible to reduce [[ferricyanide]] ions to [[ferrocyanide]] ions at the cathode:
:Fe(CN){{su|p=3-|b=6}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Fe(CN){{su|p=4-|b=6}}

Neutral molecules can also react at either of the electrodes. For example: p-Benzoquinone can be reduced to hydroquinone at the cathode:

[[Image:P-Benzochinon.svg|35px]] + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → [[Image:Hydrochinon2.svg]]

In the last example, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (hydrogen ions) also take part in the reaction, and are provided by an acid in the solution, or by the solvent itself (water, methanol etc.). Electrolysis reactions involving H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are fairly common in acidic solutions. In aqueous alkaline  solutions, reactions involving OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (hydroxide ions) are common.

Sometimes the solvents themselves (usually water) are oxidized or reduced at the electrodes. It is even possible to have electrolysis involving gases. Such as when using a [[Gas diffusion electrode]].

===Energy changes during electrolysis===
The amount of electrical energy that must be added equals the change in [[Gibbs free energy]] of the reaction plus the losses in the system. The losses can (in theory) be arbitrarily close to zero, so the maximum [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] efficiency equals the [[enthalpy]] change divided by the free energy change of the reaction. In most cases, the electric input is larger than the enthalpy change of the reaction, so some energy is released in the form of heat. In some cases, for instance, in the electrolysis of [[steam]] into hydrogen and oxygen at high temperature, the opposite is true and heat energy is absorbed. This heat is absorbed from the surroundings, and the [[heating value]] of the produced hydrogen is higher than the electric input.

===Related techniques===
The following techniques are related to electrolysis:
* [[Electrochemical cell]]s, including the hydrogen [[fuel cell]], use differences in [[Standard electrode potential]] to generate an electrical potential that provides useful power. Though related via the interaction of ions and electrodes, electrolysis and the operation of electrochemical cells are quite distinct. However, a chemical cell should ''not'' be seen as performing ''electrolysis in reverse''.

==Faraday's laws of electrolysis==
{{main|Faraday's laws of electrolysis}}

===First law of electrolysis===
In 1832, Michael Faraday reported that the quantity of elements separated by passing an electric current through a molten or dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] is proportional to the quantity of electric charge passed through the circuit. This became the basis of the first law of electrolysis:
:&lt;math&gt;m = k \cdot q&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;m = e \cdot Q&lt;/math&gt;

where;
e is known as electrochemical equivalent of the metal deposited or of the gas liberated at the electrode.

===Second law of electrolysis===
Faraday discovered that when the same amount of current is passed through different electrolytes/elements connected in series, the mass of substance liberated/deposited at the electrodes  is directly proportional to their [[equivalent weight]].

==Industrial uses==
[[Image:hall-heroult-kk-2008-12-31.png|thumb|[[Hall-Heroult process]] for producing [[aluminium]]]]
* [[Electrometallurgy]] is the process of reduction of metals from metallic compounds to obtain the pure form of metal using electrolysis. [[Aluminium]], [[lithium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], and in some cases [[copper]], are produced in this way.
* Production of [[chlorine]] and [[sodium hydroxide]]
* Production of [[sodium chlorate]] and [[potassium chlorate]]
* Production of perfluorinated organic compounds such as [[trifluoroacetic acid]] by the process of [[electrofluorination]]
* Production of [[Copper extraction techniques#Electrorefining|electrolytic copper]] as a [[cathode]], from refined [[copper]] of lower purity as an [[anode]].

Electrolysis has many other uses:
* Production of [[oxygen]] for [[spacecraft]] and [[nuclear submarines]].
* Production of [[hydrogen]] for fuel, using a cheap source of electrical energy.

Electrolysis is also used in the cleaning and preservation of old artifacts. Because the process separates the non-metallic particles from the metallic ones, it is very useful for cleaning a wide variety of metallic objects, from old coins to even larger objects including [[rust]]ed [[cast iron]] [[cylinder block]]s and [[cylinder head|heads]] when rebuilding automobile engines. [[Rust removal]] from small iron or steel objects by electrolysis can be done in a home workshop using simple materials such as a plastic bucket, [[tap water]], lengths of [[rebar]], [[Sodium carbonate|washing soda]], [[baling wire]], and a [[battery charger]].&lt;ref name="antique-engines"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rust Removal using Electrolysis|url=http://antique-engines.com/electrol.asp|website=antique-engines.com|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing processes===
In manufacturing, electrolysis can be used for:
* [[Electroplating]], where a thin film of metal is deposited over a substrate material. Electroplating is used in many industries for either functional or decorative purposes, as in vehicle bodies and nickel coins.
* [[Electrochemical machining]] (ECM), where an electrolytic cathode is used as a shaped tool for removing material by anodic oxidation from a workpiece. ECM is often used as technique for [[Burr (edge)|deburring]] or for etching metal surfaces like tools or knives with a permanent mark or logo.

==Competing half-reactions in solution electrolysis==
Using a cell containing inert platinum electrodes, electrolysis of aqueous solutions of some salts leads to reduction of the cations (e.g., metal deposition with, e.g., zinc salts) and oxidation of the anions (e.g. evolution of bromine with bromides). However, with salts of some metals (e.g. sodium) hydrogen is evolved at the cathode, and for salts containing some anions (e.g. sulfate SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) oxygen is evolved at the anode. In both cases this is due to water being reduced to form hydrogen or oxidized to form oxygen.
In principle the voltage required to electrolyze a salt solution can be derived from the [[standard electrode potential]] for the reactions at the anode and cathode. The [[standard electrode potential]] is directly related to the [[Gibbs free energy]], ΔG, for the reactions at each electrode and refers to an electrode with no current flowing. An extract from the [[table of standard electrode potentials]] is shown below.

In terms of electrolysis, this table should be interpreted as follows:
* Oxidized species (often a cation) with a more negative cell potential are more difficult to reduce than oxidized species with a more positive cell potential. For example, it is more difficult to reduce a sodium ion to a sodium metal than it is to reduce a zinc ion to a zinc metal.
* Reduced species (often an anion) with a more positive cell potential are more difficult to oxidize than reduced species with a more negative cell potential. For example, it is more difficult to oxidize sulfate anions than it is to oxidize bromide anions.

Using the [[Nernst equation]] the [[electrode potential]] can be calculated for a specific concentration of ions, temperature and the number of electrons involved. For pure water ([[pH]] 7):
* the electrode potential for the reduction producing hydrogen is −0.41 V
* the electrode potential for the oxidation producing oxygen is +0.82 V.
Comparable figures calculated in a similar way, for 1M [[zinc bromide]], ZnBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are −0.76 V for the reduction to Zn metal and +1.10 V for the oxidation producing bromine.
The conclusion from these figures is that hydrogen should be produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode from the electrolysis of water—which is at variance with the experimental observation that zinc metal is deposited and bromine is produced.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, A.E. (1951), ''A textbook of Quantitative Inorganic Analysis'', Longmans, Green and Co&lt;/ref&gt;
The explanation is that these calculated potentials only indicate the thermodynamically preferred reaction. In practice many other factors have to be taken into account such as the kinetics of some of the reaction steps involved. These factors together mean that a higher potential is required for the reduction and oxidation of water than predicted, and these are termed [[overpotential]]s. Experimentally it is known that [[overpotential]]s depend on the design of the cell and the nature of the electrodes.

For the electrolysis of a neutral (pH 7) sodium chloride solution, the reduction of sodium ion is thermodynamically very difficult and water is reduced evolving hydrogen leaving hydroxide ions in solution. At the anode the oxidation of chlorine is observed rather than the oxidation of water since the overpotential for the oxidation of [[chloride]] to [[chlorine]] is lower than the overpotential for the oxidation of [[water]] to [[oxygen]]. The [[hydroxide ion]]s and dissolved [[chlorine]] gas react further to form [[hypochlorous acid]]. The aqueous solutions resulting from this process is called [[electrolyzed water]] and is used as a disinfectant and cleaning agent.

===Electrolysis of acidified  water===
{{main|Electrolysis of water}}
Electrolysis of water produces [[hydrogen]].
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g); E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = +1.229 V

The [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] of water electrolysis varies widely. The efficiency of an electrolyser is a measure of the enthalpy contained in the hydrogen (to undergo combustion with oxygen, or some other later reaction), compared with the input electrical energy. Heat/enthalpy values for hydrogen are well published in science and engineering texts, as 144 MJ/kg.  Note that fuel cells (not electrolysers) cannot use this full amount of heat/enthalpy, which has led to some confusion when calculating efficiency values for both types of technology.  In the reaction, some energy is lost as heat. Some reports quote efficiencies between 50% and 70% for alkaline electrolysers; however, much higher practical efficiencies are available with the use of PEM ([[polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis|Polymer Electrolyte Membrane electrolysis]]) and catalytic technology, such as 95% efficiency.&lt;ref name="carmo2013a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carmo|first=M|author2=Fritz D |author3=Mergel J |author4=Stolten D |title=A comprehensive review on PEM water electrolysis|journal=Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=38|issue=12|pages=4901|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

About 4% of hydrogen gas produced worldwide is generated by electrolysis, and normally used onsite. Hydrogen is used for the creation of ammonia for fertilizer via the [[Haber process]], and converting heavy petroleum sources to lighter fractions via [[hydrocracking]].

===Carbon/hydrocarbon assisted water electrolysis===
{{main|Hydrogen production}}
Recently, to reduce the energy input, the utilization of carbon ([[coal]]), [[alcohol]]s (hydrocarbon solution), and organic solution ([[glycerol]], formic acid, [[ethylene glycol]], etc.) with co-electrolysis of water has been proposed as a viable option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2016.07.062|title=Electro-catalytic conversion of ethanol in solid electrolyte cells for distributed hydrogen generation|journal=Electrochimica Acta|volume=212|pages=744|year=2016|last1=Ju|first1=Hyungkuk|last2=Giddey|first2=Sarbjit|last3=Badwal|first3=Sukhvinder P.S.|last4=Mulder|first4=Roger J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon/hydrocarbon assisted water electrolysis (so-called CAWE) process for hydrogen generation would perform this operation in a single [[electrochemical]] reactor. This system energy balance can be required only around 40% electric input with 60% coming from the chemical energy of carbon or hydrocarbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.033|title=Low emission hydrogen generation through carbon assisted electrolysis|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=40|pages=70|year=2015|last1=Giddey|first1=S.|last2=Kulkarni|first2=A.|last3=Badwal|first3=S.P.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process utilizes solid coal/carbon particles or powder as fuels dispersed in acid/alkaline electrolyte in the form of slurry and the carbon contained source co-assist in the electrolysis process as following theoretical overall reactions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.03.195|title=Role of iron species as mediator in a PEM based carbon-water co-electrolysis for cost-effective hydrogen production|journal=

Carbon/Coal slurry (C + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) -&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;      E' = 0.21 V (reversible voltage) / E' = 0.46 V (thermo-neutral voltage)

or

Carbon/Coal slurry (C + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) -&gt; CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;         E' = 0.52 V reversible voltage) / E' = 0.91 V (thermo-neutral voltage)

Thus, this CAWE approach is that the actual cell overpotential can be significantly reduced to below 1 V as compared to 1.5 V for conventional water electrolysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11691">'''Engineered stone''' is a composite material made of crushed stone bound together by an adhesive, (most commonly [[polymer]] [[resin]], with some newer versions using cement mix). This category includes engineered [[quartz]], polymer [[concrete]] and engineered [[marble]] stone.&lt;ref name=cw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/cast-polymer-categories|title=Cast polymer categories|author=Sara Black|date=August 1, 2013|website=compositesworld.com|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of these products depends on the original stone used. For engineered marbles the most common application is indoor flooring and walls, while the [[quartz]] based product is used primarily for kitchen [[countertop]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2007/07/q-a-which-countertop-material-is-toughest/index.htm|title=Q&amp;A: Which countertop material is toughest?|date=July 9, 2007|publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative to laminate or granite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-washington-post/20170527/282961040082429|title=Open floor plans and parking among buyers’ biggerst desires|author=Jon Coile|date=May 27, 2017|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=July 9, 2018|via=[[PressReader]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related materials include [[geopolymers]] and [[cast stone]]. Unlike [[terrazzo]], the material is factory made in either blocks or slabs, cut and polished by fabricators, and assembled at the worksite.

[[File:Engineered stone countertop.jpg|thumb|Engineered stone kitchen countertops with undermount sink and [[induction cooker|cooktop]] installed. Tops are cut and polished at the fabricator's shop.]]

Engineered stone (US name) is also commonly referred to as [[agglomerate]] or agglomerated stone, the last term being that recognised by European Standards (EN 14618), although to add to the terminological confusion, this standard also includes materials manufactured with a cementitious binder.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The quartz version (which end consumers are much more likely to directly deal with) is commonly known as 'quartz surface' or just 'quartz'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-washington-post/20170121/283188673106824|title=Quartz supplants granite as people’s choice for countertops|author=Deborah K. Dietsch|date=January 21, 2017|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=July 9, 2018|via=[[PressReader]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing equipment ==
[[Breton (company)|Breton S.P.A.]], a privately held company of [[Treviso]], Italy, that developed large-scale Breton method in 1960s,&lt;ref name=cw /&gt; is the dominant supplier of equipment for making engineered stone.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Although Breton was the original manufacturer of moulding equipment and still holds multiple international patents on the process, there are now several other companies producing similar machinery.

== Composition ==
Stone aggregates is the major filler, although other material like coloured glass, shells, metals, or mirrors might be added. A typical resin based material will consist of 93% stone aggregates by weight and 7% resin (66% quartz and 34% resin by volume) . Different types of resins are used by different manufacturers. Epoxy and polyester resin are the most common types. Chemicals such as UV absorbers and stabilizers are added. To aid curing, [[hydrogen peroxide]] is added.

== Process ==
Compaction by vibrocompression vacuum process uses elastomeric molds in which a crushed stone/resin mix is cast on a moving belt. The mixture of approximately 93% stone [[Aggregate (composite)|aggregates]] and 7% polyester resin by weight (66% quartz and 34% resin by volume) is heated and compressed under vacuum in a large press. The vibration helps compact the mixture and results in an isotropic slab with virtually no porosity.&lt;ref name=cw /&gt; Engineered stone is then processed in basically the same manner as its natural counterpart.

Some companies import boulders themselves to crush into agglomerates (stone powders) of various grain size for their products, others simply buy already-crushed stone powders.

== Properties ==
Engineered stone is typically worked in the same way as natural stone using a [[water jet cutter]] or a [[diamond blade]]. This is in contrast with [[solid surface]] materials which can be cut with regular saws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Scroll Saw Handbook|last=Spielman|first=Patrick|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=0-8069-7877-5|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The material can be produced in either 12&amp;nbsp;mm, 20&amp;nbsp;mm or 30&amp;nbsp;mm thicknesses.  The most common slab format is 3040&amp;nbsp;mm x 1440&amp;nbsp;mm for Quartz and 3050&amp;nbsp;mm x 1240&amp;nbsp;mm for Breton-based marbles, but other sizes like 3040&amp;nbsp;mm x 1650&amp;nbsp;mm are produced according to market demand.

Engineered stone is non porous,&lt;ref name=consumer /&gt; more flexible, and harder than  many types of natural stone. Since it has a uniform internal structure, it does not have hidden cracks or flaws that may exist in natural stone and also has a color/pattern consistency from slab to slab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stoneworld.com/articles/89262-one-on-one-with-sophie-lubin|title=One-on-One with Sophie Lubin|author=Jason Kamery|date=January 1, 2017|website=stoneworld.com|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyester resin binding agents allow some flexibility, preventing cracking under flexural pressure. But, the binding agents often continue to harden, leading to a loss of flexural strength over time. The polyester resins are not completely UV stable and engineered stone should not be used in outdoor applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.renowaze.com/articles/pros-and-cons-of-quartz-countertops/|title=Pros and Cons of Quartz Countertops - Engineered Quartz Countertops|author=Alexia|date=June 9, 2018|website=renowaze.com|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous exposure to UV can cause discoloration of the stone, and breakdown of the resin binder.

The material is sometimes damaged by direct application of heat. Quartz engineered stone is less heat resistant than other stone surfaces including most granite, marble and limestone; but is not affected by temperatures lower than 150&amp;nbsp;°C (300&amp;nbsp;°F). Quartz engineered stone can be damaged by sudden temperature changes. Manufacturers recommend that hot pots and pans never be placed directly on the surface, and that a hot pad or [[trivet]] is used under portable cooking units.

When used as floor tiles, care is required in ensuring compatibility with the adhesive used. Reaction resin adhesives and rapid drying cementitious adhesives are generally successful, but bond failure can occur with other cementitious adhesives. Additionally, agglomerate stone tiles are more sensitive to both thermal expansion and contraction and to dampness from underlying screeds, necessitating the inclusion of movement joints at a higher frequency than for stone or ceramic floor tiles (see for example British Standard BS 5385-5: 2011) and verification by testing of the dryness of underlying layers.

== Difference between marble and quartz ==
Although both the [[marble]]- and [[quartz]]-based engineered stones are created through a similar process, and multiple companies produce both at the same time, there are distinct differences in their properties and applications.

Marble is a relatively soft material which is prone to scratching, but also makes maintaining it much less difficult. Typically they can be re-polished all the way until they become too thin. Marble is also much more common and accessible around the world and comes in a wider variety, which gives their engineered counterpart a significant edge in pricing and the variety in its pattern and colors. Engineered marbles are typically most popular as flooring materials for large commercial projects such as hotels, shopping centers, business lobbies, where they combine the attractive appearance of marbles with more budget-friendly prices and reliable delivery times.

Quartz meanwhile is a much harder material. The [[Mohs scale]] of marble is roughly 3, where as quartz are usually at 7. This makes them much more resistant to scratching, however it also makes re-polishing and general processing of them a more difficult task, which is why they are most commonly used for kitchen counter tops, where the value added through processing can offset their considerably higher cost.

There is also a difference between Quartz and Quartzite, which are often confused because of the similarities in the name. Quartz countertops are man-made even through quartz is a natural material. Quartzite countertops on the other hand are natural and they are considered to be a high end countertop material.&lt;ref name=consumer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/kitchen-countertops/difference-between-quartz-and-quartzite/|title=What Is the Difference Between Quartz and Quartzite?|author=Daniel DiClerico|date=April 9, 2016|publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market development ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2018}}
[[Italy]] was the most dominant country in the supply of engineered stone products from the 1980s until the early 2000s, especially in engineered marble. The growth of the Chinese economy has changed the market drastically as China now has the most producers and largest overall quantity produced.  There are estimated to be more than 100 engineered stone suppliers in China alone. India also has roughly 40 slab producing units as of December 2012.  The original companies that operate Breton machines such as the Italian companies, Quarella, Santa Margherita and the Taiwanese company Romastone remain the most recognizable brands for marble. The private Spanish company Cosentino brand Silestone and the public Israeli company [[Caesarstone]] are the most recognizable brands for quartz also Totem Quartz, the Iranian company which has a huge market in middle east and Central Asia. Gulfstone company, Oman based  company is the only producer of engineered quartz stone in the GCC.  [[China]] is now probably the largest market for engineered marble due to new construction projects, while engineered quartz is primarily sold in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] as high end residential kitchen counter tops. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Health issues ==
As with any silica-containing stone, [[silicosis]] may result from breathing dust produced when cutting or processing engineered stone made with quartz. The risk of inhaling quartz dust can be mitigated by taking appropriate safety precautions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3768.pdf|website=osha.gov|title=Hazard Alert Worker Exposure to Silica during Countertop Manufacturing, Finishing and Installation|publisher=[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|accessdate=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk of silicosis is high when little or no safety precautions or protective equipment are used. This may occur in small shops or in countries where the industry is not regulated or monitored.&lt;ref name="NYT4116"&gt;{{cite news|author=Barry Meier|title=Popular Quartz Countertops Pose a Risk to Workers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/business/popular-quartz-countertops-pose-a-risk-to-workers.html|accessdate=April 2, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Marion Folsom''' (14 May 1894, [[Sprague, Washington]] - 12 January 1970, [[New York City]]) was an electronics company executive and was a permanent representative of the [[Holy See]].

==Biography==
He graduated from [[Manhattan College]], [[Fordham University]], and held an LLD from the [[University of San Francisco]].

Folsom began his career in 1910 at the [[Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.]] in the merchandising field. He held the position of manager of west coast operations and Marketing Vice President.  From 1940 to 1941 he worked for department store, Goldblatt Brothers in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and was assistant coordinator of purchases for OPM from 1941 to 1942. In 1942 he was appointed as special assistant to the [[Under Secretary of the Navy]].  It was here where he met [[David Sarnoff]], who got him his next job as Executive Vice President of the RCA Victor Division. He was promoted to President in 1949 and served as Chairman of the Executive Committee Board from 1957. He also served as director of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, the John P. Maguire Company, [[NBC]], the General Cable Corporation, RCA Commons, Crown Cork &amp; Seal, Tishman International, and served as the representative of the [[Holy See]] to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;John A. Hall, [http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull292/29201284754.pdf The International Atomic Energy Agency: Origins and Early Years.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the [[Augusta National Golf Club]], the Blind Brook Club of Port Chester, the [[Bohemian Club]], the [[Everglades Club]] of [[Palm Beach, Florida]], the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Pilgrims of the United States]] and the Catholic fraternity KÖHV Alpenland (Austria).

In mechanical systems such as [[internal combustion engine]]s, the term refers to the power lost in overcoming the friction between two moving surfaces, a different phenomenon.

== Economics ==
Friction loss is a significant economic concern wherever fluids are made to flow, whether entirely enclosed in a pipe or duct, or with a surface open to the air.
* Historically, it is a concern in [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] of all kinds, throughout human history. It is also relevant to sewer lines. Systematic study traces back to [[Henry Darcy]], an aqueduct engineer. 
* Natural flows in river beds are important to human activity; friction loss in a stream bed has an effect on the height of the flow, particularly significant during flooding. 
* The economies of pipelines for petrochemical delivery are highly affected by friction loss. The Yamal–Europe pipeline carries methane at a volume flow rate of 32.3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of gas per year, at [[Reynolds number]]s greater than 50&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* In [[hydropower]] applications, the energy lost to skin friction in [[flume]] and [[penstock]] is not available for useful work, say generating electricity. 
* [[Irrigation]] water is pumped at large yearly volumes of flow, entailing significant expense.
* [[HVAC]] systems pump conditioning air on a widespread basis.
* In [[refrigeration]] applications, energy is expended pumping the coolant fluid through pipes or through the condenser. In split systems, the pipes carrying the coolant take the place of the air ducts in HVAC systems. 
* Wells and domestic water systems must be engineered for effective and economical operation.

== Defining Friction Loss ==
In the following discussion, we define volumetric flow rate V̇ (i.e. volume of fluid flowing) 
V̇ = πr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;v

where
: r = radius of the pipe (for a pipe of circular section, the internal radius of the pipe).
: v = mean velocity of fluid flowing through the pipe.
: A = cross sectional area of the pipe.
In long pipes, the loss in pressure (assuming the pipe is level) is proportional to the length of pipe involved.
Friction loss is then the change in pressure Δp per unit length of pipe ''L''
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \Delta p }{ L }. &lt;/math&gt;
When the pressure is expressed in terms of the equivalent height of a column of that fluid, as is common with water, the friction loss is expressed as ''S'', the "head loss" per length of pipe, a dimensionless quantity also known as the ''hydraulic slope''. 
: &lt;math&gt;S = \frac{h_f }{ L } = \frac{ 1 }{ \rho  \mathrm{g} } \frac{ \Delta p }{ L } .&lt;/math&gt;
where
: ρ = [[density|density of the fluid]], (SI kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
: g = the local [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration due to gravity]];

== Characterizing Friction Loss ==

&lt;!--This mode of energy loss is due to the [[shear stress]] between the pipe surface and the fluid flowing within, that flow being characterized as either [[Laminar flow|laminar]] or [[Turbulent flow|turbulent]].  
In the case of laminar flow, obtained at low flow velocity, that velocity varies smoothly between the bulk of the fluid and the surface, where it is zero. 
In turbulent flow (obtained at higher velocity) a layer of chaotic eddies and vortices near the surface, called the viscous sub-layer, forms the transition to the bulk flow.
For turbulent flow, the pressure drop is influenced by the roughness of the surface; in the laminar case, such effects are negligible because the velocity near the surface is zero.&lt;ref name=Munson /&gt;--&gt;

Friction loss, which is due to the [[shear stress]] between the pipe surface and the fluid flowing within, depends on the conditions of flow and the physical properties of the system. These conditions can be encapsulated into a dimensionless number Re, known as the [[Reynolds number]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}=\frac{1}{\nu}VD&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is the mean fluid velocity and ''D'' the diameter of the (cylindrical) pipe.  In this expression, the properties of the fluid itself are reduced to the [[kinematic viscosity]] ν
:&lt;math&gt;\nu=\frac{\mu}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
where
: μ = [[viscosity|viscosity of the fluid]] (SI kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s)

=== Friction loss in straight pipe ===
The friction loss In a uniform, straight sections of pipe, known as "major loss", is caused by the effects of [[viscosity]], the movement of fluid [[molecules]] against each other or against the (possibly rough) wall of the pipe. Here, it is greatly affected by whether the flow is [[Laminar flow|laminar]] (Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2000) or [[Turbulent flow|turbulent]] (Re &gt; 4000):&lt;ref name=Munson /&gt;
* In [[laminar flow]], losses are [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation|proportional to fluid velocity]], ''V''; that velocity varies smoothly between the bulk of the fluid and the pipe surface, where it is zero. The roughness of the pipe surface influences neither the fluid flow nor the friction loss. 
* In [[turbulent flow]], losses are proportional to the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation|square of the fluid velocity]], ''V''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;  here, a layer of chaotic eddies and vortices near the pipe surface, called the viscous sub-layer, forms the transition to the bulk flow. In this domain, the effects of the roughness of the pipe surface must be considered. It is useful to characterize that roughness as the ratio of the roughness height ε to the pipe diameter ''D'', the "relative roughness".  Three sub-domains pertain to turbulent flow:
** In the smooth pipe domain, friction loss is relatively insensitive to roughness. 
** In the rough pipe domain, friction loss is dominated by the relative roughness and is insensitive to Reynolds number.
** In the transition domain, friction loss is sensitive to both. 
* For Reynolds numbers 2000&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;4000, the flow is unstable, varying with time as vortices within the flow form and vanish randomly. This domain of flow is not well modeled, nor are the details well understood.

=== Form friction ===
Factors other than straight pipe flow induce friction loss; these are known as “minor loss”:
* Fittings, such as bends, couplings, valves, or transitions in [[Hose (tubing)|hose]] or [[piping|pipe]] diameter, or
* Objects intruded into the fluid flow.
For the purposes of calculating the total friction loss of a system, the sources of form friction are sometimes reduced to an equivalent length of pipe.

== Measurements ==
Because of the importance of friction loss in civil engineering and in industry, it has been studied extensively for over a century.

== Calculating friction loss ==

=== Hagen–Poiseuille ===
Laminar flow is encountered in practice with very viscous fluids, such as motor oil, flowing through small-diameter tubes, at low velocity. Friction loss under conditions of laminar flow follow the [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation]], which is an exact solution to the [[Hagen–Poiseuille flow from the Navier–Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]]. For a circular pipe with a fluid of density ''ρ'' and viscosity ''μ'', the hydraulic slope ''S'' can be expressed
:&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{64}{\mathrm{Re}} \frac{V^2}{2gD} = \frac{64\nu}{2g} \frac{V}{D^2}&lt;/math&gt;
In laminar flow (that is, with Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;~2000), the hydraulic slope is proportional to the flow velocity.

=== Darcy–Weisbach ===
In many practical engineering applications, the fluid flow is more rapid, therefore turbulent rather than laminar. Under turbulent flow, the friction loss is found to be roughly proportional to the square of the flow velocity and inversely proportional to the pipe diameter, that is, the friction loss follows the phenomenological [[Darcy–Weisbach equation]] in which the ''hydraulic slope'' ''S'' can be expressed&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S = f_D \frac{ 1 }{ 2g } \frac{V^2}{D} &lt;/math&gt;
where we have introduced the [[Darcy friction factor formulae|Darcy friction factor ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;]] (but see [[Darcy–Weisbach equation#Confusion with the Fanning friction factor|''Confusion with the Fanning friction factor'']]);
: ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Darcy friction factor formulae|Darcy friction factor]]
Note that the value of this dimensionless factor depends on the pipe diameter ''D'' and the roughness of the pipe surface ε. Furthermore, it varies as well with the flow velocity ''V''  and on the physical properties of the fluid (usually cast together into the Reynolds number Re). Thus, the friction loss is not precisely proportional to the flow velocity squared, nor to the inverse of the pipe diameter: the friction factor takes account of the remaining dependency on these parameters.

From experimental measurements, the general features of the variation of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; are, for fixed ''relative roughness'' ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D'' and for Reynolds number Re = ''V'' ''D''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;ν&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;~2000,{{efn|See [[Moody chart]]}}
* With relative roughness ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; declines in value with increasing Re in an approximate power law, with one order of magnitude change in ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; over four orders of magnitude in Re. This is called the "smooth pipe" regime, where the flow is turbulent but not sensitive to the roughness features of the pipe (because the vortices are much larger than those features). 
* At higher roughness, with increasing Reynolds number Re, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; climbs from its smooth pipe value, approaching an asymptote that itself varies logarithmically with the relative roughness ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D''; this regime is called "rough pipe" flow. 
* The point of departure from smooth flow occurs at a Reynolds number roughly inversely proportional to the value of the relative roughness: the higher the relative roughness, the lower the Re of departure. The range of Re and ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D'' between smooth pipe flow and rough pipe flow is labeled "transitional". In this region, the measurements of Nikuradse show a decline in the value of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; with Re, before approaching its asymptotic value from below,&lt;ref name=Nikuradse1933/&gt; although Moody chose not to follow those data in his chart,&lt;ref name = Moody1944&gt;{{citation

* At values of 2000&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;4000, there is a ''critical zone'' of flow, a transition from laminar to turbulence, where the value of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; increases from its laminar value of 64&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Re to its smooth pipe value. In this regime, the fluid flow is found to be unstable, with vortices appearing and disappearing within the flow over time.
* The entire dependence of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; on the pipe diameter ''D'' is subsumed into the Reynolds number Re and the relative roughness ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D'', likewise the entire dependence on fluid properties density ρ and viscosity μ is subsumed into the Reynolds number Re.

With these quantities as inputs, the friction factor ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; can be expressed in closed form in the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation#Turbulent Regime|Colebrook–White equation or other fitting function]], and the flow volume ''Q'' and flow velocity ''V'' can be calculated therefrom.

=== Calculating Friction Loss for Air in a Duct ===
[[File:Equal-friction chart for air in metal duct (ε = 0.05mm).svg|thumb|A graphical depiction of the relationship between Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'', the pressure loss per unit length of pipe, versus flow volume ''Q'', for a range of choices for pipe diameter ''D'', for air at standard temperature and pressure. Units are SI. Lines of constant Re{{radic|''f''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;}} are also shown.&lt;ref name=Elder/&gt;]]
Friction loss takes place as a gas, say air, flows through [[Duct (flow)|duct work]].&lt;ref name=Elder&gt;{{cite web
| title= Duct Design

| accessdate=8 October 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The difference in the character of the flow from the case of water in a pipe stems from the differing Reynolds number Re and the roughness of the duct.

The friction loss is customarily given as pressure loss for a given duct length, Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'', in units of (US) inches of water for 100 feet or (SI) kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

For specific choices of duct material, and assuming air at standard temperature and pressure (STP), standard charts can be used to calculate the expected friction loss.&lt;ref name=FreeCalc /&gt;&lt;ref name=PDHonline&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chart exhibited in this section can be used to graphically determine the required diameter of duct to be installed in an application where the volume of flow is determined and where the goal is to keep the pressure loss per unit length of duct ''S'' below some target value in all portions of the system under study. First, select the desired pressure loss Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'', say 1&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.12 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O per 100&amp;nbsp;ft) on the vertical axis (ordinate). Next scan horizontally to the needed flow volume ''Q'', say 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s (2000 cfm): the choice of duct with diameter ''D'' = 0.5 m (20 in.) will result in a pressure loss rate Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'' less than the target value. Note in passing that selecting a duct with diameter ''D'' = 0.6 m (24 in.) will result in a loss Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'' of 0.02&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.02 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O per 100&amp;nbsp;ft), illustrating the great gains in blower efficiency to be achieved by using modestly larger ducts.

The following table gives flow rate ''Q'' such that friction loss per unit length Δ''p'' / ''L'' (SI kg / m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is  0.082, 0.245, and 0.816, respectively, for a variety of nominal duct sizes. The three values chosen for friction loss correspond to, in US units inch water column per 100 feet, 0.01, .03, and 0.1. Note that, in approximation, for a given value of flow volume, a step up in duct size (say from 100mm to 120mm) will reduce the friction loss by a factor of 3.

A '''glovebox''' (or '''glove box''') is a sealed container that is designed to allow one to manipulate objects where a separate atmosphere is desired. Built into the sides of the glovebox are [[glove]]s arranged in such a way that the user can place their hands into the gloves and perform tasks inside the box without breaking containment. Part or all of the box is usually transparent to allow the user to see what is being manipulated. Two types of gloveboxes exist. The first allows a person to work with hazardous substances, such as radioactive materials or infectious disease agents, and the second allows manipulation of substances that must be contained within a very high purity inert atmosphere, such as [[argon]] or [[nitrogen]].  It is also possible to use a glovebox for manipulation of items in a [[vacuum chamber]].

== Inert atmosphere work ==
The gas in a glovebox is pumped through a series of treatment devices which remove [[solvent]]s, [[water]] and [[oxygen]] from the gas. Heated [[copper]] metal (or some other finely divided metal) is commonly used to remove oxygen, this oxygen removing column is normally regenerated by passing a [[hydrogen]]/[[nitrogen]] mixture through it while it is heated: the [[water]] formed is passed out of the box with the excess hydrogen and nitrogen. It is common to use [[molecular sieve]]s to remove water by absorbing it in the molecular sieves' pores. Such a box is often used by [[organometallic]] chemists to transfer dry solids from one container to another container.

An alternative to using a glovebox for air sensitive work is to employ Schlenk methods using a [[Schlenk line]]. One disadvantage of working in a glovebox is that organic [[solvents]] will attack the plastic seals. As a result, the box will start to leak and [[water]] and [[oxygen]] can then enter the box. Another disadvantage of a glovebox is that oxygen and water can diffuse through the plastic gloves.

Inert atmosphere gloveboxes are typically kept at a higher pressure than the surrounding air, so that any microscopic leaks are mostly leaking inert gas out of the box instead of letting air in.

== Hazardous materials work ==
At the now-deactivated [[Rocky Flats Plant]], which manufactured [[Plutonium pit|plutonium triggers]], also called "pits", production facilities consisted of linked [[stainless steel]] gloveboxes up to 64 feet, or 20 meters, in length, which contained the equipment which [[forge]]d and [[machining|machined]] the trigger parts. The gloves were [[lead]]-lined. Other materials used in the gloveboxes included [[polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] viewing windows and Benelex shielding composed of [[wood fiber]] and plastic which [[radiation shielding|shielded]] against [[neutron emission|neutron]] [[radiation]]. Manipulation of the lead-lined gloves was onerous work.&lt;!--material from a Denver Post article, December 9, 2004, pages 1B and 4B--&gt;

Some gloveboxes for radioactive work are under inert conditions, for instance, one nitrogen-filled box contains an argon-filled box. The argon box is fitted with a gas treatment system to keep the gas very pure to enable electrochemical experiments in molten salts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php?id=173&amp;type=100 Institute for Transuranium Elements]. jrc.ec.europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

Gloveboxes are also used in the biological sciences when dealing with [[anaerobic organism|anaerobes]] or high-[[biosafety level]] pathogens.

Gloveboxes used for hazardous materials are generally maintained at a lower pressure than the surrounding atmosphere, so that microscopic leaks result in air intake rather than hazard outflow. Gloveboxes used for hazardous materials generally incorporate [[HEPA]] filters into the exhaust, to keep the hazard contained.

The jury awarded plaintiffs $127.8 million in [[damages]], the largest ever in US product liability and personal injury cases.  ''Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Company'' was one of the most widely publicized of the more than a hundred lawsuits brought against Ford in connection with rear-end accidents in the Pinto.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sherefkin|2003}}: Ford customers filed 117 lawsuits, according to Peter Wyden in The Unknown Iacocca.&lt;/ref&gt;

On appeal, Ford contested the trial court judgement on the basis of errors, and contested the punitive damages award on the grounds of an absence of [[malice (law)|malice]] and that the punitive damages award was not authorized by statute and was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed the trial court.&lt;ref name=myth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Gary T|title=The Myth of the Ford Pinto Case|journal=Rutgers Law Review|date=1990|volume=43|page=1013|url=http://www.pointoflaw.com/articles/archives/000023.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial ==

A 1972 Pinto rear-end impact and fire in [[Orange County, California]], resulted in the death of the driver Lily Gray and severe injury to passenger Richard Grimshaw. Lawsuits were combined for trial. The jury awarded $127.8 million in [[damages]]; $125 million in [[punitive damages]] and $2,841,000 in compensatory damages to Grimshaw and $665,000 in compensatory damages to the family of Gray. The jury award was the largest ever in US product liability and personal injury cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Teen wins $127.8 million in car-fire suit |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=February 7, 1978 |page=6 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1978/02/07/page/6/article/teen-wins-127-8-million-in-car-fire-suit |accessdate=March 4, 2016 |location=[[Santa Ana, California]] |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Award in injury suit is over $127 million |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |location=[[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] |date=February 7, 1978 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes20080419&gt;{{cite news |title=Retired O.C. judge handled major cases |date=April 19, 2008 |first=Dennis |last=McLellan |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=March 4, 2016 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/19/local/me-goldstein19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury award was the largest against an automaker until $150 million in ''Hardy vs. General Motors'' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Nichole M |last1=Christian |first2=Angelo B |last2=Henderson |first3=Asra Q |last3=Nomani |title=Chrysler is Told to Pay $262.5 Million by Jurors in Minivan-Accident Trial |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 9, 1997 |page=1 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB876346627583219500 |accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge reduced the jury's punitive damages award to $3.5 million, which he later said was "still larger than any other punitive damage award in the state by a factor of about five."&lt;ref name=latimes20080419/&gt;

=== Reaction ===

[[University of California Los Angeles]] law professor Gary T. Schwartz, writing in 1990, said that the jury verdict was plausible, and that the "core of the Pinto story" was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Given this description of the Pinto's design problem, some comments can be offered on the decision-making process within Ford that resulted in the Pinto. As shown above, a famous Ford report cannot be interpreted as showing Ford balancing lives against dollars in designing the Pinto. To state that the report does not itself reveal such a process does not mean, however, that such a process did not take place. Accordingly, I have consulted the Grimshaw record to learn what light it sheds on this question. As far as basic gas tank location is concerned, I am persuaded that the trunk capacity problem, in conjunction with American auto custom, provides the best explanation for Ford's choice to place the Pinto gas tank behind the axle.  As for additional design proposals brought forward by the plaintiffs, several of them-for example, a bladder within the gas tank, and a "tank within the tank"-concerned somewhat innovative technology that had never been utilized in actual auto production. At trial, there was testimony that a bladder would have been feasible in the early 1970's, but also rebuttal testimony that a bladder was at this time beyond the bounds of feasibility. The jury's general verdict does not reveal whether and how the jury resolved such conflicts in the evidence; and I am in no position to resolve them here.  Consider now, however, the combination of a stronger bumper, a smooth (bolt-free) differential, and the addition of both hat sections and horizontal cross-members. This combination of design changes clearly would have improved the Pinto's safety to some appreciable extent. According to the evidence, the overall cost of this combination would have been $9; and it makes sense to assume that these items were turned down by Ford in planning the Pinto primarily on account of their monetary costs. It is plausible to believe, then, that because of these costs, Ford decided not to improve the Pinto's design, knowing that its decision would increase the chances of the loss of consumer life.  Once a variety of misconceptions are stripped away, this limited core of the Pinto story remains.  And this is a core that may well be strong enough to support the "myth" of the Ford Pinto case in the second of the meanings described above.  What follows is my effort to explicate the elements of that myth.&lt;ref name=myth/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2010, the award "signalled to the auto industry that it would be harshly sanctioned for ignoring known defects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Toyota is just the latest automaker to face auto safety litigation |date=March 14, 2010 |first=Carol J. |last=Williams |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=March 4, 2016 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/14/business/la-fi-toyota-litigate14-2010mar14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeal ==

In discussing the appellate court findings of fact Schwartz (1990) notes that the appellate court was under strict rules of interpretation.  He states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For reasons quite beyond the court's control, its opinion must be treated cautiously as a source of actual facts. Because the defendant was appealing a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, the court was under an obligation to view all the evidence in a way most favorable to the plaintiffs and essentially to ignore evidence in the record that might be favorable to the defendant. See id. at 773, 820, 174 Cal. Rptr. at 359, 388. In fact, Ford's basic position at trial-which the court's opinion at no point mentions-was that the approaching car (a Ford Galaxie) had not slowed down at all, and had struck the Gray car at a speed in excess of 50 miles per hour. There was an enormous amount of evidence at trial supporting each of the parties' factual claims as to the Galaxie's closing speed. Had the jury accepted Ford's speed estimate, there would not have been much of an issue of crashworthiness: for the plaintiffs' position throughout trial was that even a state-of-the-art fuel system could not maintain integrity in a 50 mile-per hour collision.&lt;ref name=myth/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Appellate court findings of fact ===

The trial court's findings of fact regarding the accident, the design of the Pinto, Ford's crash testing, and Ford's [[cost benefit analysis]] were not contested on appeal, and were accepted by the appellate court "in accordance with established principles of appellate review."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: Since sufficiency of the evidence is in issue only regarding the punitive damage award, we make no attempt to review the evidence bearing on all of the litigated issues. Subject to amplification when we deal with specific issues, we shall set out the basic facts pertinent to these appeals in accordance with established principles of appellate review&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The accident ====

A 1972 Ford Pinto hatchback stalled on a freeway, erupting into flames when it was rear-ended by a [[Ford Galaxie]] proceeding in the same direction. Lilly Gray, the driver of the Pinto, suffered severe burns to her entire body and resulted in her death by congestive heart failure. 13-year-old Richard Grimshaw, a passenger, suffered severe, permanently disfiguring burns to his entire body. Grimshaw underwent numerous skin grafts and extensive surgeries, but still lost portions of the fingers on his left hand and his left ear in the accident. Doctors estimated that Grimshaw would require many more surgeries within the next 10 years.

The plaintiff's expert testified that the Pinto's gas tank was pushed forward upon impact and punctured by a flange or bolt on the differential housing. Fuel sprayed from the tank and entered the passenger compartment through the gaps between the rear wheel wells and the floor.

==== Design of the Pinto Fuel System ====

In 1968, Ford began designing the subcompact car that would eventually become known as the Pinto.

The courts found that [[Lee Iacocca]], at the time a vice president at Ford, conceived the Pinto "project and was its moving force" and said that "Ford's objective was to build a car at or below 2,000 pounds to sell for no more than $2,000."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: In 1968, Ford began designing a new subcompact automobile which ultimately became the Pinto. Mr. Iacocca, then a Ford vice president, conceived the project and was its moving force. Ford's objective was to build a car at or below 2,000 pounds to sell for no more than $2,000.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts described the Pinto as a "rush project," and said that while standard automotive industry practice was that "engineering studies precede the styling," in the case of the Pinto project "styling preceded engineering and dictated engineering design to a greater degree than usual."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: Ordinarily marketing surveys and preliminary engineering studies precede the styling of a new automobile line. Pinto, however, was a rush project, so that styling preceded engineering and dictated engineering design to a greater degree than usual.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The court found that the Pinto's styling required the gas tank to be placed behind the rear axle, instead of over the rear axle as was "the preferred practice in Europe and Japan" and that the Pinto had "only 9 or 10 inches" of "crush space," "far less than in any other American automobile or Ford overseas subcompact."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: Among the engineering decisions dictated by styling was the placement of the fuel tank. It was then the preferred practice in Europe and Japan to locate the gas tank over the rear axle in subcompacts because a small vehicle has less "crush space" between the rear axle and the bumper than larger cars. The Pinto's styling, however, required the tank to be placed behind the rear axle leaving only 9 or 10 inches of "crush space"--far less than in any other American automobile or Ford overseas subcompact.&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that the Pinto's bumper "was little more than a chrome strip, less substantial than the bumper of any other American car produced then or later."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: In addition, the Pinto was designed so that its bumper was little more than a chrome strip, less substantial than the bumper of any other American car produced then or later.&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that the Pinto's rear structure lacked reinforcement "found in all automobiles produced by Ford's overseas operations," rendering the Pinto "less crush resistant than other vehicles."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: Pinto's rear structure also lacked reinforcing members known as "hat sections" (two longitudinal side members) and horizontal cross-members running between them such as were found in cars of larger unitized construction and in all automobiles produced by Ford's overseas operations. The absence of the reinforcing members rendered the Pinto less crush resistant than other vehicles.&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that a flange and a line of bolts on the Pinto's differential housing "were sufficient to puncture a gas tank driven forward upon rear impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: Finally, the differential housing selected for the Pinto had an exposed flange and a line of exposed bolt heads. These protrusions were sufficient to puncture a gas tank driven forward against the differential upon rear impact.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Crash Tests ====

Ford tested two production models of the Pinto and prototypes, some of which "were true duplicates of the design car," "to determine, among other things, the integrity of the fuel system in rear-end accidents."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: During the development of the Pinto, prototypes were built and tested. Some were "mechanical prototypes" which duplicated mechanical features of the design but not its appearance while others, referred [119 Cal. App. 3d 775] to as "engineering prototypes," were true duplicates of the design car. These prototypes as well as two production Pintos were crash tested by Ford to determine, among other things, the integrity of the fuel system in rear-end accidents.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed federal regulations required impacts "without significant fuel spillage," up to {{convert|20|mph}} impacts by 1972 and {{convert|30|mph}} by 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: Ford also conducted the tests to see if the Pinto as designed would meet a proposed federal regulation requiring all automobiles manufactured in 1972 to be able to withstand a 20-mile-per-hour fixed barrier impact without significant fuel spillage and all automobiles manufactured after January 1, 1973, to withstand a 30-mile-per-hour fixed barrier impact without significant fuel spillage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crash tests proved that the Pinto could not meet the proposed regulations. A collision from the rear "caused the fuel tank to be driven forward and to be punctured, causing fuel leakage." A collision of a production Pinto "caused the fuel neck to be torn from the gas tank and the tank to be punctured by a bolt head on the differential housing." In at least one test collision "spilled fuel entered the driver's compartment through gaps resulting from the separation of the seams joining the rear wheel wells to the floor pan," separations due in part to "the lack of reinforcement in the rear structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: The crash tests revealed that the Pinto's fuel system as designed could not meet the 20-mile-per-hour proposed standard. Mechanical prototypes struck from the rear with a moving barrier at 21 miles per hour caused the fuel tank to be driven forward and to be punctured, causing fuel leakage in excess of the standard prescribed by the proposed regulation. A production Pinto crash tested at 21 miles per hour into a fixed barrier caused the fuel neck to be torn from the gas tank and the tank to be punctured by a bolt head on the differential housing. In at least one test, spilled fuel entered the driver's compartment through gaps resulting from the separation of the seams joining the rear wheel wells to the floor pan. The seam separation was occasioned by the lack of reinforcement in the rear structure and insufficient welds of the wheel wells to the floor pan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford tested modified Pinto prototypes, which "proved safe at speeds at which the Pinto failed," including modifications to line the fuel tank with a rubber bladder, to locate the fuel tank above rather than behind the rear axle, and to add reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: Tests conducted by Ford on other vehicles, including modified or reinforced mechanical Pinto prototypes, proved safe at speeds at which the Pinto failed. Where rubber bladders had been installed in the tank, crash tests into fixed barriers at 21 miles per hour withstood leakage from punctures in the gas tank. Vehicles with fuel tanks installed above rather than behind the rear axle passed the fuel system integrity test at 31-miles-per-hour fixed barrier. A Pinto with two longitudinal hat sections added to firm up the rear structure passed a 20-mile-per-hour rear impact fixed barrier test with no fuel leakage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Cost to Remedy Design Deficiencies ====

The courts found that, while "the standard of care for engineers in the industry" after a failed safety test was to "redesign and retest," and although fixes were inexpensive, "Ford produced and sold the Pinto to the public without doing anything to remedy the defects."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: When a prototype failed the fuel system integrity test, the standard of care for engineers in the industry was to redesign and retest it. The vulnerability of the production Pinto's fuel tank at speeds of 20 and 30-miles-per-hour fixed barrier tests could have been remedied by inexpensive "fixes," but Ford produced and sold the Pinto to the public without doing anything to remedy the defects.&lt;/ref&gt;

Design changes that would have enhanced the fuel system at very little cost included:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: Design changes that would have enhanced the integrity of the fuel tank system at relatively little cost per car included the following: Longitudinal side members and cross members at $2.40 and $1.80, respectively; a single shock absorbent "flak suit" to protect the tank at $4; a tank within a tank and placement of the tank over the axle at $5.08 to $5.79; a nylon bladder within the tank at $5.25 to $8; placement of the tank over the axle surrounded with a protective barrier at a cost of $9.95 per car; substitution of a rear axle with a smooth differential housing at a cost of $2.10; imposition of a protective shield between the differential housing and the tank at $2.35; improvement and reenforcement of the bumper at $2.60; addition of eight inches of crush space a cost of $6.40.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Longitudinal side members: $2.40 ea.
* Cross members: $1.80 ea.
* Shock absorbing "flak suit" for the fuel tank: $4.00
* Tank within a tank and placement of the tank over the rear axle: $5.08 to $5.79
* Nylon bladder within the tank: $5.25 to $8.00
* Placement of the tank over the rear axle with a protective barrier: $9.95
* Substitution of rear axle with a smooth differential housing: $2.10
* Protective shield between differential housing and fuel tank: $2.35
* Improvement and reinforcement of rear bumper: $2.60
* Additional {{convert|8|inch}} crush space: $6.40

&lt;blockquote&gt;Equipping the car with a reinforced rear structure, smooth axle, improved bumper and additional crush space at a total cost of $15.30 would have made the fuel tank safe in a 34 to 38-mile-per-hour rear-end collision by a vehicle the size of the Ford Galaxie. If, in addition to the foregoing, a bladder or tank within a tank were used or if the tank were protected with a shield, it would have been safe in a 40 to 45-mile-per-hour rear impact. If the tank had been located over the rear axle, it would have been safe in a rear impact at 50 miles per hour or more.&lt;ref name="Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co. 1981"&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Management knowledge ====

The Pinto project team held regular product review meetings chaired and attended by Ford vice presidents. The Pinto was approved by Ford's Product Planning Committee, which included Iacocca and other Ford vice presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: The feasibility study was conducted under the supervision of Mr. Robert Alexander, vice president of car engineering. Ford's Product Planning Committee, whose members included Mr. Iacocca, Mr. Robert Alexander, and Mr. Harold MacDonald, Ford's group vice president of car engineering, approved the Pinto's concept and made the decision to go forward with the project. During the course of the project, regular product review meetings were held which were chaired by Mr. MacDonald and attended by Mr. Alexander.&lt;/ref&gt; At an April, 1971 product review meeting, a report prepared by Ford engineers entitled "Fuel System Integrity Program Financial Review" was distributed and discussed, which referred to the crash tests of Ford vehicles and estimated the financial impact of design changes to comply with the proposed federal fuel system integrity standards. The report recommended deferring fixes in order to accrue cost savings.&lt;ref name="MacDonald 1971"&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}:At an April 1971 product review meeting chaired by Mr. MacDonald, those present received and discussed a report (exhibit 125) prepared by Ford engineers pertaining to the financial impact of a proposed federal standard on fuel system integrity and the cost savings which would accrue from deferring even minimal "fixes." The report refers to crash tests of the integrity of the fuel system of Ford vehicles and design changes needed to meet anticipated federal standards...Exhibit No. 125 was a report presented at a Ford production review meeting in April 1971, recommending action to be taken in anticipation of the promulgation of federal standards on fuel system integrity. The report recommended, inter alia, deferral from 1974 to 1976 of the adoption of "flak suits" or "bladders" in all Ford cars, including the Pinto, in order to realize a savings of $20.9 million.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harley Copp]], a former Ford engineer and the executive in charge of the crash testing program, "testified that the highest level of Ford's management made the decision to go forward with the production of the Pinto, knowing that the gas tank was vulnerable to puncture and rupture at low rear impact speeds creating a significant risk of death or injury from fire and knowing that 'fixes' were feasible at nominal cost."&lt;ref name="Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co. 1981"/&gt;

=== Disposition of appeals ===

The appellate court affirmed the trial court.

==== Defendant's Appeals ====

Ford contested the trial court judgement on the basis of errors, and contested the punitive damages award on the grounds of an absence of [[malice (law)|malice]] and that the punitive damages award was not authorized by statute and was unconstitutional.

===== Errors =====

The appellate court "concluded that Ford has failed to demonstrate that any errors or irregularities occurred during the trial which resulted in a miscarriage of justice requiring reversal."&lt;ref name="Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co. 1981"/&gt;

Ford contended that the trial court erroneously admitted Ford's "Fuel System Integrity Program Financial Review" report as irrelevant and prejudicial. In the document, Ford engineers recommending deferring the installation of "flak suits" or "bladders," available at a cost of $4 to $8 per car, in all Ford cars to 1976, which allowed the company to realize a savings of $20.9 million.&lt;ref name="MacDonald 1971"/&gt; The appellate court ruled that the report was highly relevant in that "A reasonable inference may be drawn from the evidence that despite management's knowledge that the Pinto's fuel system could be made safe at a cost of but $4 to $8 per car, it decided to defer corrective measures to save money and enhance profits."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: A reasonable inference may be drawn from the evidence that despite management's knowledge that the Pinto's fuel system could be made safe at a cost of but $4 to $8 per car, it decided to defer corrective measures to save money and enhance profits. The evidence was thus highly relevant and properly received.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Punitive damages =====

Ford contended the punitive damages on two grounds: 1) punitive damages are statutorily and constitutionally impermissible in design defect cases; and 2) there was no evidentiary support for a finding of malice or corporate responsibility for malice.

;Punitive damages in design defect cases

The appellate court found no statutory impediments to punitive damages and said that "Ford's contention that the statute is unconstitutional has been repeatedly rejected."&lt;ref name="Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co. 1981"/&gt;

;Malice

Ford contended that the "Exemplary damages" section of California's civil code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=California's Civil Code § 3294 |accessdate=March 4, 2016 |url=http://codes.findlaw.com/ca/civil-code/civ-sect-3294.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; required an "evil motive," or an intent to injure the person harmed, for punitive damages, and argued absence of [[malice (law)|malice]]. The appellate court cited precedent that "malice" as used in California's "Exemplary damages" code included "not only a malicious intention to injure the specific person harmed, but conduct evincing 'a conscious disregard of the probability that the actor's conduct will result in injury to others.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: As this court recently noted, numerous California cases after Davis v. Hearst, supra, have interpreted the term "malice" as used in section 3294 to include, not only a malicious intention to injure the specific person harmed, but conduct evincing "a conscious disregard of the probability that the actor's conduct will result in injury to others."&lt;/ref&gt; In Taylor v. Superior Court, the California Superior Court held that a conscious disregard of the safety of others is sufficient to meet the ''animus malus'' required for punitive damages awards, adding: "In order to justify an award of punitive damages on this basis, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he wilfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences." In a commercial context, the imposition of punitive damages deters the furtherance of "objectional corporate policies" and encourages the remedy of safety concerns that might otherwise go unchecked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Taylor v. Superior Court |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/24/890.html |date=August 21, 1979 |vol=24 |accessdate=March 3, 2016 |court=[[Supreme Court of California|Cal.]] |reporter=CA3d |opinion=890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;598 P.2d 854&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.|1981}}: In Taylor v. Superior Court, supra, 24 Cal. 3d 890, our high court's most recent pronouncement on the subject of punitive damages, the court observed that the availability of punitive damages has not been limited to cases in which there is an actual intent to harm plaintiff or others. (Id, at p. 895.) The court concurred with the Searle (G.D. Searle &amp; Co. v. Superior Court, supra, 49 Cal.App.3d 22) court's suggestion that conscious disregard of the safety of others is an appropriate description of the animus malus required by Civil Code section 3294, adding: "In order to justify an award of punitive damages on this basis, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he wilfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the appellate court decision,

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was ample evidence to support a finding of malice and Ford's responsibility for malice. Through the results of the crash tests Ford knew that the Pinto's fuel tank and rear structure would expose consumers to serious injury or death in a 20- to 30-mile-per-hour collision. There was evidence that Ford could have corrected the hazardous design defects at minimal cost but decided to defer correction of the shortcomings by engaging in a cost-benefit analysis balancing human lives and limbs against corporate profits. Ford's institutional mentality was shown to be one of callous indifference to public safety. There was substantial evidence that Ford's conduct constituted "conscious disregard" of the probability of injury to members of the consuming public...There is substantial evidence that management was aware of the crash tests showing the vulnerability of the Pinto's fuel tank to rupture at low speed rear impacts with consequent significant risk of injury or death of the occupants by fire. There was testimony from several sources that the test results were forwarded up the chain of command;...While much of the evidence was necessarily circumstantial, there was substantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably find that Ford's management decided to proceed with the production of the Pinto with knowledge of test results revealing design defects which rendered the fuel tank extremely vulnerable on rear impact at low speeds and endangered the safety and lives of the occupants. Such conduct constitutes corporate malice.&lt;ref name="Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co. 1981"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ford argued that the amount awarded in punitive damages was excessive. The test for deciding whether the amount was excessive as a matter of law or was so grossly disproportionate as to raise the presumption that it was the product of passion or prejudice is four-prong: 1) the degree of reprehensibility of defendant's conduct; 2) wealth of the defendant; 3) the amount of compensatory damages; and 4) an amount which would serve as a deterrent effect on like conduct by the defendant and others. The appellate court held that

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the conduct of Ford's management was reprehensible in the extreme. It exhibited a conscious and callous disregard of public safety in order to maximize corporate profits...Ford's tortious conduct endangered the lives of thousands of Pinto purchasers. Weighed against the factor of reprehensibility, the punitive damage award as reduced by the trial judge was not excessive."&lt;ref name="Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co. 1981"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In light of Ford's 7.7 billion dollar net worth and 983 million dollar income after taxes in 1976, the court found that the punitive award was approximately 0.005% of Ford's net worth and 0.03% of its income. The ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages was approximately 1.4:1. Significantly, Ford did not argue about the excessiveness of the compensatory damages. Lastly, the punitive award was sufficient to require Ford to take notice, rather than allowing the company to write it off as a mere business expense.

==== Plaintiff's Appeals ====

Grimshaw appeals from the order granting a conditional new trial and from the amended judgment entered pursuant to the order. Grimshaw argues that 1) the punitive damages awarded by the jury where not excessive as a matter of law; 2) the specification of reasons was inadequate; and 3) the court abused its discretion in cutting the award so drastically. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in reducing the jury's award of punitive damages from more than 122 million to 3.5 million or in granting a new trial for excessive damages. There was no evidence showing that the trial judge abused his discretion, nor that he acted in any way that was not fair and reasonable under the circumstances.

'''Howard Wilson Emmons''' (1912–1998) was a professor in the department of [[Mechanical Engineering]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;Land and Trefethen, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; During his career he conducted original research on [[fluid mechanics]], [[combustion]] and [[fire safety]]. Today he is most widely known for his pioneering work in the field of fire safety engineering. He has been called "the father of modern fire science" for his contribution to the understanding of flame propagation and fire dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Beyler, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped design the first [[supersonic wind tunnel]], identified a signature of the transition to [[turbulence]] in [[boundary layer]] flows (now known as "Emmons spots"), and was the first to observe [[compressor stall]] in a gas turbine compressor (still a major item of research today).&lt;ref&gt;Kronauer et al., 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He initiated studies on diffusion flames inside a boundary layer, and [[Emmons problem]] is named after him. He was eventually awarded the [[Timoshenko Medal]] by the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] and the 1968 Sir Alfred Egerton Gold Medal from [[The Combustion Institute]].

Upon Professor Emmons' death, Professor Patrick Pagni wrote, "It is not possible to properly summarize the magnitude of Professor Emmons' unique contributions to the establishment of fire safety science as a discipline, other than to call him  "Mr. Fire Research".&lt;ref&gt;Bryner 2000, p.425-427.&lt;/ref&gt;

He continues to be remembered through the Emmons Lecture at International Symposium of [[The International Association for Fire Safety Science]] and the Howard W. Emmons Distinguished Scholar Endowment at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]].

An '''ice nucleus''' is a particle which acts as the [[Nucleation|nucleus]] for the formation of an [[ice crystal]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].

==Mechanisms==
There are a number of mechanisms of ice nucleation in the atmosphere through which ice nuclei can catalyse the formation of ice particles. In the upper [[troposphere]], water vapor can deposit directly onto solid particle. In clouds warmer than about &amp;minus;37&amp;nbsp;°C where liquid water can persist in a [[supercooling|supercooled]] state, ice nuclei can trigger droplets to freeze. 

Contact nucleation can occur if an ice nucleus collides with a supercooled droplet, but the more important mechanism of freezing is when an ice nucleus becomes immersed in a supercooled water droplet and then triggers freezing.

In the absence of an ice nucleating particle, pure water droplets can persist in a supercooled state to temperatures approaching &amp;minus;37&amp;nbsp;°C where they freeze homogeneously.&lt;ref name=Kulkarni2015&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/2014JD021567 | author = Kulkarni G | year =  2014 | title = Ice nucleation of bare and sulfuric acid-coated mineral dust particles and implication for cloud properties | volume = 119 | pages = 9993–10011 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014JD021567/abstract | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research |bibcode = 2014JGRD..119.9993K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koop2004&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1524/zpch.218.11.1231.50812 | author = Koop, T. | date =  March 25, 2004 | title = Homogeneous ice nucleation in water and aqueous solutions | volume = 218 | issue = 11 | pages = 1231–1258 | url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16233451 | accessdate = 2008-04-07 | journal = Zeitschrift für physikalische Chemie }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray2010&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/c003297b | author = Murray B | year =  2010 | title = Homogeneous ice nucleation in water and aqueous solutions | volume = 12 | pages = 10380–10387 | url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2010/CP/c003297b#!divAbstract | journal = Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics |bibcode = 2010PCCP...1210380M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cloud dynamics==
Ice particles can have a significant effect on [[cloud]] dynamics. They are known to be important in the processes by which clouds can become electrified, which causes [[lightning]]. They are also known to be able to form the [[cloud seeding|seeds for rain droplets]].

==Atmospheric particulate matter==
Many different types of [[atmospheric particulate matter]] can act as ice nuclei, both natural and anthropogenic, including those composed of desert dust, soot, organic matter, bacteria (e.g. ''[[Pseudomonas syringae]]''), pollen, fungal spores and volcanic ash amongst others.&lt;ref name=Murray2012&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/c2cs35200a | author = Murray| year =  2012| title = Ice nucleation by particles immersed in supercooled cloud droplets | volume = 41 | pages = 6519–6554 | url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2012/CS/c2cs35200a | journal = Chem Soc Rev |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18309078"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Christner BC, Morris CE, Foreman CM, Cai R, Sands DC | title=Ubiquity of biological ice nucleators in snowfall | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=319 | issue=5867 | year=2008 | pages=1214 | doi=10.1126/science.1149757 |id= | pmid=18309078|bibcode = 2008Sci...319.1214C }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the exact [[nucleation]] potential of each type varies greatly, depending on the exact atmospheric conditions. Very little is known about the spatial distribution of these particles, their overall importance for global climate through ice cloud formation, and whether human activity has played a major role in changing these effects.

{{About|the chemical element}}
{{pp-move-indef}}
{{infobox iridium}}
'''Iridium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Ir''' and [[atomic number]] 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white [[transition metal]] of the [[platinum group]], iridium is the second-densest element (after [[osmium]]) with a density of {{val|22.56|u=g/cm3}} as defined by experimental X-ray crystallography. However at room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure, iridium has a density of {{val|22.65|u=g/cm3}}, {{val|0.04|u=g/cm3}} higher than osmium measured the same way. It is the most [[corrosion]]-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000&amp;nbsp;°C. Although only certain molten salts and [[halogen]]s are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.

Iridium was discovered in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural [[platinum]]. [[Smithson Tennant]], the primary discoverer, named iridium for the Greek goddess [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], personification of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium is [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|one of the rarest elements]] in [[Crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]], with annual production and consumption of only three [[tonne]]s. &lt;sup&gt;191&lt;/sup&gt;Ir and &lt;sup&gt;193&lt;/sup&gt;Ir are the only two naturally occurring [[isotope]]s of iridium, as well as the only [[stable isotope]]s; the latter is the more abundant of the two.

The most important iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with [[chlorine]], though iridium also forms a number of [[organometallic compound]]s used in industrial [[catalysis]], and in research. Iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in high-performance [[spark plug]]s, [[crucible]]s for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes for the production of chlorine in the [[chloralkali process]]. Iridium radioisotopes are used in some [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s.

Iridium is found in meteorites in much higher abundance than in the Earth's crust.&lt;ref name="Becker2002"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Luann | last1=Becker | url=http://www.miracosta.edu/home/kmeldahl/articles/blows.pdf | title=Repeated Blows | accessdate=January 19, 2016 | journal=Scientific American | year=2002 | volume=286 | issue=3 | pages=77–83| bibcode=2002SciAm.286c..76B | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0302-76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] gave rise to the [[Alvarez hypothesis]] that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 66&amp;nbsp;million years ago]]. Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the [[Pacific Ocean]] suggested the [[Eltanin impact]] of about 2.5 million years ago.

It is thought that the total amount of iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that observed in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and [[Goldschmidt classification#Siderophile elements|tendency]] of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
[[File:iridium2.jpg|left|thumb|One [[troy ounce]] (31.1035&amp;nbsp;g) of arc-melted iridium|alt=A flattened drop of dark gray substance]]
A member of the [[platinum group]] [[metal]]s, iridium is white, resembling [[platinum]], but with a slight yellowish cast. Because of its [[hardness]], brittleness, and very high [[melting point]], solid iridium is difficult to machine, form, or work; thus [[powder metallurgy]] is commonly employed instead.&lt;ref name="greenwood" /&gt; It is the only metal to maintain good mechanical properties in air at temperatures above {{convert|1600|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt; It has the 10th highest [[List of elements by boiling point|boiling point among all elements]] and becomes a [[superconductor]] at temperatures below 0.14&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kittel |first=C.|title=Introduction to Solid state Physics|edition=7th |publisher=Wiley-India |date=2004 |isbn=81-265-1045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iridium's [[modulus of elasticity]] is the second-highest among the metals, only being surpassed by [[osmium]].&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt; This, together with a high [[shear modulus]] and a very low figure for [[Poisson's ratio]] (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral [[strain (chemistry)|strain]]), indicate the high degree of [[stiffness]] and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt;

The measured [[density]] of iridium is only slightly lower (by about 0.12%) than that of osmium, the [[List of elements by density|densest element]] known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Osmium, the Densest Metal Known|author=Arblaster, J. W.|journal=Platinum Metals Review|volume=39|issue=4|date=1995|pages=164|url=http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/dynamic/article/view/pmr-v39-i4-164-164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Cotton|first = Simon|title = Chemistry of Precious Metals| page = 78|publisher = Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|date = 1997|isbn = 978-0-7514-0413-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ambiguity occurred regarding which of the two elements was denser, due to the small size of the difference in density and difficulties in measuring it accurately,&lt;ref name="crc"&gt;{{cite book| author=Lide, D. R.| title=CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.| edition=70th| publisher=Boca Raton (FL):CRC Press| date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, with increased accuracy in factors used for calculating density [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray crystallographic]] data yielded densities of 22.56&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for iridium and 22.59&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for osmium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/pdf/pmr-v33-i1-014-016.pdf|format=PDF|title=Densities of osmium and iridium: recalculations based upon a review of the latest crystallographic data|author=Arblaster, J. W.|journal=Platinum Metals Review|volume=33|issue=1|date=1989|pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties===
Iridium is the most corrosion-resistant metal known:&lt;ref name="Emsley" /&gt; it is not attacked by almost any [[acid]], [[aqua regia]], molten metals, or silicates at high temperatures. It can, however, be attacked by some molten [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], such as [[sodium cyanide]] and [[potassium cyanide]],&lt;ref name="emsley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[oxygen]] and the [[halogen]]s (particularly [[fluorine]])&lt;ref name="perry"&gt;{{cite book|title = Handbook of Inorganic Compounds|author=Perry, D.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of iridium}}
Iridium has two naturally occurring, stable [[isotope]]s, &lt;sup&gt;191&lt;/sup&gt;Ir and &lt;sup&gt;193&lt;/sup&gt;Ir, with [[natural abundance]]s of 37.3% and 62.7%, respectively.&lt;ref name="nubase" /&gt; At least 37 [[radioisotope]]s have also been synthesized, ranging in [[mass number]] from 164 to 202. [[iridium-192|&lt;sup&gt;192&lt;/sup&gt;Ir]], which falls between the two stable isotopes, is the most stable radioisotope, with a [[half-life]] of 73.827&amp;nbsp;days, and finds application in [[brachytherapy]]&lt;ref name="mager" /&gt; and in industrial [[radiography]], particularly for nondestructive testing of welds in steel in the oil and gas industries; iridium-192 sources have been involved in a number of radiological accidents. Three other isotopes have half-lives of at least a day—&lt;sup&gt;188&lt;/sup&gt;Ir, &lt;sup&gt;189&lt;/sup&gt;Ir, and &lt;sup&gt;190&lt;/sup&gt;Ir.&lt;ref name="nubase" /&gt; Isotopes with masses below 191 decay by some combination of [[Beta decay#β+ decay|β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay]], [[alpha decay|α decay]], and (rare) [[proton emission]], with the exceptions of &lt;sup&gt;189&lt;/sup&gt;Ir, which decays by [[electron capture]]. Synthetic isotopes heavier than 191 decay by [[Beta decay#β+ decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay]], although &lt;sup&gt;192&lt;/sup&gt;Ir also has a minor electron capture decay path.&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Audi| first = G.| title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode = 2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.

At least 32 [[nuclear isomer|metastable isomers]] have been characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most stable of these is &lt;sup&gt;192m2&lt;/sup&gt;Ir, which decays by [[isomeric transition]] with a half-life of 241&amp;nbsp;years,&lt;ref name="nubase" /&gt; making it more stable than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is &lt;sup&gt;190m3&lt;/sup&gt;Ir with a half-life of only 2&amp;nbsp;µs.&lt;ref name="nubase" /&gt; The isotope &lt;sup&gt;191&lt;/sup&gt;Ir was the first one of any element to be shown to present a [[Mössbauer effect]]. This renders it useful for [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]] for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.&lt;ref name="ir-191" /&gt;

===Discovery===
Chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in [[aqua regia]] (a mixture of [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]] and [[nitric acid]]s) to create soluble salts. They always observed a small amount of a dark, insoluble residue.&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt; [[Joseph Louis Proust]] thought that the residue was [[graphite]].&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt; The French chemists [[Victor Collet-Descotils]], [[Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy]], and [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]] also observed the black residue in 1803, but did not obtain enough for further experiments.&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt;

In 1803, British scientist [[Smithson Tennant]] (1761–1815) analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal. Vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids&lt;ref name="Emsley" /&gt; and obtained a volatile new oxide, which he believed to be of this new metal—which he named ''ptene'', from the Greek word {{lang|el|πτηνός}} ''ptēnós'', "winged".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A System of Chemistry of Inorganic Bodies|url=https://archive.org/details/asystemchemistr07thomgoog|author=Thomson, T.|authorlink=Thomas Thomson (chemist)|publisher=Baldwin &amp; Cradock, London; and William Blackwood, Edinburgh|date=1831|page=693}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="griffith"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.technology.matthey.com/article/48/4/182-189/ |title=Bicentenary of Four Platinum Group Metals.

===Metalworking and applications===
British scientist [[John George Children]] was the first to melt a sample of iridium in 1813 with the aid of "the greatest galvanic battery that has ever been constructed" (at that time).&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt; The first to obtain high-purity iridium was [[Robert Hare (chemist)|Robert Hare]] in 1842. He found it had a density of around 21.8&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and noted the metal is nearly immalleable and very hard. The first melting in appreciable quantity was done by [[Henri Sainte-Claire Deville]] and [[Jules Henri Debray]] in 1860. They required burning more than 300&amp;nbsp;liters of pure {{chem|O|2}} and {{chem|H|2}} gas for each kilogram of iridium.&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt;

These extreme difficulties in melting the metal limited the possibilities for handling iridium. [[John Isaac Hawkins]] was looking to obtain a fine and hard point for fountain pen nibs, and in 1834 managed to create an iridium-pointed gold pen. In 1880, [[John Holland (pen maker)|John Holland]] and [[William Lofland Dudley]] were able to melt iridium by adding [[phosphorus]] and patented the process in the United States; British company [[Johnson Matthey]] later stated they had been using a similar process since 1837 and had already presented fused iridium at a number of [[World's fair|World Fairs]].&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt; The first use of an alloy of iridium with ruthenium in [[thermocouple]]s was made by Otto Feussner in 1933. These allowed for the measurement of high temperatures in air up to 2000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt;

In Munich, Germany in 1957 [[Rudolf Mössbauer]], in what has been called one of the "landmark experiments in twentieth-century physics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=179–190|title=Landmark Experiments in Twentieth Century Physics|author=Trigg, G.

The examples are irarsite and cuproiridsite, to mention some.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mindat.org/min-2042.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mindat.org/element/Iridium&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nrmima.nrm.se/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.handbookofmineralogy.org/pdfs/cuproiridsite.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fmm.ru/images/8/89/NDM_2010_45_Stepanov_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Earth's crust, iridium is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure: igneous deposits (crustal intrusions from below), impact craters, and deposits reworked from one of the former structures. The largest known primary reserves are in the [[Bushveld igneous complex]] in [[South Africa]],&lt;ref name="kirk-pt" /&gt; (near the largest known impact crater, the [[Vredefort crater]]) though the large copper–nickel deposits near [[Norilsk#Norilsk-Talnakh nickel deposits|Norilsk]] in [[Russia]], and the [[Sudbury Basin]] (also an impact crater) in [[Canada]] are also significant sources of iridium. Smaller reserves are found in the United States.&lt;ref name="kirk-pt" /&gt; Iridium is also found in secondary deposits, combined with platinum and other platinum group metals in [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits. The alluvial deposits used by [[pre-Columbian]] people in the [[Chocó Department]] of [[Colombia]] are still a source for platinum-group metals. &lt;!-- The second large alluvial deposit was found in the [[Ural mountain]]s, Russia, which is still mined.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} --&gt; As of 2003, world reserves have not been estimated.&lt;ref name="Emsley" /&gt;

The [Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary] of 66 million years ago, marking the temporal border between the [[Cretaceous]] and [[Paleogene]] periods of [[Geologic time scale|geological time]], was identified by a thin [[stratum]] of [[iridium anomaly|iridium-rich clay]].&lt;ref name="Alvarez" /&gt; A team led by [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] proposed in 1980 an extraterrestrial origin for this iridium, attributing it to an [[asteroid]] or [[comet]] impact.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction|author=Alvarez, L.

Iridium is also obtained commercially as a by-product from [[nickel]] and [[copper]] mining and processing. During [[Copper extraction techniques#Electrorefining|electrorefining of copper]] and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold and the [[platinum group metal]]s as well as [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]] settle to the bottom of the cell as ''anode mud'', which forms the starting point for their extraction.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt; To separate the metals, they must first be brought into solution. Several separation methods are available depending on the nature of the mixture; two representative methods are fusion with [[sodium peroxide]] followed by dissolution in [[aqua regia]], and dissolution in a mixture of [[chlorine]] with [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;ref name="ullmann-pt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kirk-pt" /&gt;

After the mixture is dissolved, iridium is separated from the other platinum group metals by precipitating [[ammonium hexachloroiridate]] ({{chem|(NH|4|)|2|IrCl|6}}) or by extracting {{chem|IrCl|6|2-}} with organic amines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = The Platinum Metals| first = Raleigh| last = Gilchrist| journal = Chemical Reviews| date = 1943| volume = 32| issue = 3| pages = 277–372| doi = 10.1021/cr60103a002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first method is similar to the procedure Tennant and Wollaston used for their separation. The second method can be planned as continuous [[liquid–liquid extraction]] and is therefore more suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or ''[[metal sponge|sponge]]'' that can be treated using [[powder metallurgy]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Processing of Iridium and Iridium Alloys| first = E.

Iridium prices have fluctuated over a considerable range. With a relatively small volume in the world market (compared to other industrial metals like [[aluminium]] or [[copper]]), the iridium price reacts strongly to instabilities in production, demand, [[speculation]], hoarding, and politics in the producing countries.
As a substance with rare properties, its price has been particularly influenced by changes in modern technology:
The gradual decrease between 2001 and 2003 has been related to an oversupply of Ir crucibles used for industrial growth of large single crystals.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hagelüken, C. |journal=Metall |volume=60 |issue=1–2 |date=2006 |pages=31–42 |title=Markets for the catalysts metals platinum, palladium, and rhodium |url=http://www.preciousmetals.umicore.com/publications/articles_by_umicore/general/show_Metal_PGMmarkets_200602.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304195307/http://www.preciousmetals.umicore.com/publications/articles_by_umicore/general/show_Metal_PGMmarkets_200602.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The demand for iridium surged from 2.5 tonnes in 2009 to 10.4 tonnes in 2010, mostly because of electronics-related applications that saw a rise from 0.2 to 6 tonnes – iridium crucibles are commonly used for growing large high-quality single crystals, demand for which has increased sharply. This increase in iridium consumption is predicted to saturate due to accumulating stocks of crucibles, as happened earlier in the 2000s. Other major applications include spark plugs that consumed 0.78 tonnes of iridium in 2007, electrodes for the [[chloralkali process]] (1.1 t in 2007) and chemical catalysts (0.75 t in 2007).&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;&lt;ref name="platinum2008"&gt;{{cite book| first = D.| last = Jollie| title=Platinum 2008|publisher=Johnson Matthey|date=2008| issn = 0268-7305|url=http://www.platinum.matthey.com/uploaded_files/Pt2008/08_complete_publication.pdf| format = PDF|accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high melting point, hardness and corrosion resistance of iridium and its alloys determine most of its applications. Iridium (or sometimes platinum alloys or osmium) and mostly iridium alloys have a low wear and are used, for example, for multi-pored [[Spinneret (polymers)|spinnerets]], through which a plastic polymer melt is extruded to form fibers, such as [[rayon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Spinnerets for viscose rayon cord yarn| journal = Fibre Chemistry| volume =10| issue = 4| date = 1979| doi = 10.1007/BF00543390| pages = 377–378| first = R.

Their resistance to arc erosion makes iridium alloys ideal for electrical contacts for [[spark plug]]s,&lt;ref name="Handley" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=I03qepnj2IwC| title = Euromat 99| author = Stallforth, H.| author2 = Revell, P. A.| publisher= Wiley-VCH| date = 2000| isbn = 978-3-527-30124-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and iridium-based spark plugs are particularly used in aviation.

Pure iridium is extremely brittle, to the point of being hard to weld because the heat-affected zone cracks, but it can be made more ductile by addition of small quantities of [[titanium]] and [[zirconium]] (0.2% of each apparently works well)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US |number=3293031A|invent1=Cresswell, Peter|invent2=Rhys, David|pridate=23/12/1963|fdate=27/11/1964|pubdate=20/12/1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrosion and heat resistance makes iridium an important alloying agent. Certain long-life aircraft engine parts are made of an iridium alloy, and an iridium–[[titanium]] alloy is used for deep-water pipes because of its corrosion resistance.&lt;ref name="Emsley"/&gt; Iridium is also used as a hardening agent in platinum alloys. The [[Vickers hardness]] of pure platinum is 56&amp;nbsp;HV, whereas platinum with 50% of iridium can reach over 500&amp;nbsp;HV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/pdf/pmr-v4-i1-018-026.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-10-13| journal = Platinum Metals Review| title = Iridium Platinum Alloys| first = A.

Devices that must withstand extremely high temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature [[crucible]]s made of iridium are used in the [[Czochralski process]] to produce oxide single-crystals (such as [[sapphire]]s) for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers.&lt;ref name="Handley"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Increasing Applications for Iridium| first = J.

Specific treatments include high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy, bilary duct brachytherapy, and intracavitary cervix brachytherapy.&lt;ref name="Emsley" /&gt;

Iridium is a good catalyst for the decomposition of [[hydrazine]] (into hot nitrogen and ammonia), and this is used in practice in low-thrust rocket engines; there are more details in the [[monopropellant rocket]] article.

Iridium has been used in the [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s of unmanned spacecraft such as the ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'', ''[[Viking program|Viking]]'', ''[[Pioneer program|Pioneer]]'', ''[[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]]'', ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'', and ''[[New Horizons]]''. Iridium was chosen to encapsulate the [[plutonium-238]] fuel in the generator because it can withstand the operating temperatures of up to 2000&amp;nbsp;°C and for its great strength.&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt;

Iridium proved to be the best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The iridium layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing iridium vapor under [[vacuum|high vacuum]] on a base layer of [[chromium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Face-to-Face with Jerry Johnston, CXC Program Manager &amp; Bob Hahn, Chief Engineer at Optical Coating Laboratories, Inc., Santa Rosa, CA|publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; Chandra X-ray Center|url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/bios/johnston.html|accessdate=2008-09-24|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iridium is used in [[particle physics]] for the production of [[antiproton]]s, a form of [[antimatter]]. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a ''conversion target'', which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although [[tungsten]] may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the [[shock wave]]s induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Production of low-energy antiprotons| journal =Zeitschrift Hyperfine Interactions| volume =109| date = 1997|doi = 10.1023/A:1012680728257| pages = 33–41| first = D.| last =Möhl|bibcode = 1997HyInt.109...33M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
[[File:Gama Supreme Flat Top ebonite eyedropper fountain pen 3.JPG|right|thumb|[[Fountain pen]] nib labeled ''Iridium Point'']]

Iridium–osmium alloys were used in [[fountain pen]] [[Nib (pen)#Nib tipping|nib tip]]s. The first major use of iridium was in 1834 in nibs mounted on gold.&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt; Since 1944, the famous [[Parker 51]] fountain pen was fitted with a nib tipped by a ruthenium and iridium alloy (with 3.8% iridium). The tip material in modern fountain pens is still conventionally called "iridium", although there is seldom any iridium in it; other metals such as ruthenium, osmium and tungsten have taken its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nibs.com/ArticleIndex.html|journal=The PENnant|volume=XIII|issue=2|date=1999|title=Notes from the Nib Works—Where's the Iridium?|author=Mottishaw, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An iridium–platinum alloy was used for the [[touch hole]]s or vent pieces of [[cannon]]. According to a report of the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Exhibition of 1867]], one of the pieces being exhibited by [[Johnson and Matthey]] "has been used in a Withworth gun for more than 3000 rounds, and scarcely shows signs of wear yet. Those who know the constant trouble and expense which are occasioned by the wearing of the vent-pieces of cannon when in active service, will appreciate this important adaptation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor=Crookes, W.|volume=XV|date=1867|journal=The Chemical News and Journal of Physical Science|title=The Paris Exhibition|pages=182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pigment ''iridium black'', which consists of very finely divided iridium, is used for painting [[porcelain]] an intense black; it was said that "all other porcelain black colors appear grey by the side of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Playbook of Metals: Including Personal Narratives of Visits to Coal, Lead, Copper, and Tin Mines, with a Large Number of Interesting Experiments Relating to Alchemy and the Chemistry of the Fifty Metallic Elements|author=Pepper, J. H.|publisher=Routledge, Warne, and Routledge|date=1861|page=455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precautions ==
Iridium in bulk metallic form is not biologically important or hazardous to health due to its lack of reactivity with tissues; there are only about 20&amp;nbsp;[[parts per notation|parts per trillion]] of iridium in human tissue.&lt;ref name="Emsley" /&gt; Like most metals, finely divided iridium powder can be hazardous to handle, as it is an irritant and may ignite in air.&lt;ref name="kirk-pt"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|first = R. J.| last = Seymour|author2=O'Farrelly, J. I.|chapter=Platinum-group metals|doi=10.1002/0471238961.1612012019052513.a01.pub2|date=2001|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Very little is known about the toxicity of iridium compounds, because they are used in very small amounts, but soluble salts, such as the iridium halides, could be hazardous due to elements other than iridium or due to iridium itself.&lt;ref name="mager" /&gt; However, most iridium compounds are insoluble, which makes absorption into the body difficult.&lt;ref name="Emsley" /&gt;

A radioisotope of iridium, {{chem|192|Ir}}, is dangerous, like other radioactive isotopes. The only reported injuries related to iridium concern accidental exposure to radiation from {{chem|192|Ir}} used in [[brachytherapy]].&lt;ref name="mager"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Occupational Health and Safety|first =J.| last = Mager Stellman| chapter=Iridium|isbn=978-92-2-109816-4|date=1998|publisher=International Labour Organization| pages =63.19| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nDhpLa1rl44C&amp;pg=PT125|oclc=35279504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; High-energy gamma radiation from {{chem|192|Ir}} can increase the risk of cancer. External exposure can cause burns, [[radiation poisoning]], and death. Ingestion of &lt;sup&gt;192&lt;/sup&gt;Ir can burn the linings of the stomach and the intestines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Radioisotope Brief: Iridium-192 (Ir-192)| work = Radiation Emergencies| publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention| date = 2004-08-18| url = http://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/isotopes/pdf/iridium.pdf| format = PDF| access-date = 2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;192&lt;/sup&gt;Ir, &lt;sup&gt;192m&lt;/sup&gt;Ir, and &lt;sup&gt;194m&lt;/sup&gt;Ir tend to deposit in the [[liver]], and can pose health hazards from both [[Gamma radiation|gamma]] and [[Beta particle|beta]] radiation.&lt;ref name="argonne"&gt;{{cite web|title=Iridium |work=Human Health Fact Sheet |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory |date=2005 |url=http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/Iridium.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=2008-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304005456/http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/Iridium.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4113">The '''Kyoto Box''' is a [[solar cooker]] constructed from polypropylene with acryl glass cover. The oven would trap the suns rays, creating enough heat to cook or boil water.  It was invented by Jon Bohmer, a Norwegian born inventor based in [[Kenya]]. It was marketed as part of the Kyoto Energy product range.

==Construction and use==
Two cardboard boxes, a newer, commercial version was constructed from [[polypropylene]], making it more robust and durable.  Temperatures inside the box quickly reached 80 degrees Celsius (176 degrees Fahrenheit)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpacks.org/2009/04/09/kyoto-box-solar-cardboard-cooker-wins-climate-prize/ |title=Kyoto Box, Solar Cardboard Cooker Wins Climate Prize |publisher=GreenPacks |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a sunny day. According to the [http://www.kyoto-energy.com Kyoto Energy website], temperatures could reach a maximum of 165 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kyoto-energy.com/kyoto-box.html |title=Kyoto Box |publisher=Kyoto-energy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106202548/http://kyoto-energy.com/kyoto-box.html |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohmer claimed that the oven was capable of boiling 10 liters of water in two to three hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2009/04/10/invention-the-kyoto-box-solar-oven/ |title=Invention – The Kyoto Box solar Oven – The Blogs at HowStuffWorks |publisher=Blogs.howstuffworks.com |date=2009-04-10 |accessdate=2012-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222145034/http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2009/04/10/invention-the-kyoto-box-solar-oven/ |archivedate=2012-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[solar cooker|Solar cookers]] are being used by hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world. Solar cookers can also pasteurize or sterilize water to provide safe drinking water without using or collecting firewood.

==Updated design==
After the award of the Financial Times Climate Change Challenge 2009 the design of the Kyoto Box was modified from the original cardboard to polypropylene, boosting the cooking performance. A further innovation was the use of a white reflector instead of one covered with aluminum foil or Mylar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kyoto-energy.com/images/stories/kyoto-box-pr.pdf |title=KYoto : Award-winning "Kyoto Box" launches ahead of Copenhagen summit |publisher=Kyoto-energy.com |accessdate=2013-11-02 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventor==
The Norwegian inventor, Jon Bohmer, made the first model of the Kyoto Box with his daughters then aged 10 and 5 years old. It was first just a project with his children, but later won the FT Climate Change Challenge award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/indepth/climatechallenge Climate Change Challenge].  Collected 4 Apr 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  He won the first prize, since the invention reduced [[Greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] by eliminating the need to burn [[wood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7991654.stm Prize for 'Sun in the box' cooker] BBC News.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18189">The '''lapse rate''' is the rate at which [[temperature]] in [[Earth's atmosphere]] decreases with an increase in [[altitude]], or increases with the decrease in altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark Zachary |last=Jacobson |title=Fundamentals of Atmospheric Modeling |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |edition=2nd |year=2005 |isbn=0-521-83970-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=C. Donald |last=Ahrens |title=Meteorology Today |publisher=Brooks/Cole Publishing |edition=8th |year=2006 |isbn=0-495-01162-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lapse rate'' arises from the word ''lapse'', in the sense of a gradual change. 

Although this concept is most often applied to the Earth's [[troposphere]], it can be extended to any gravitationally supported [[fluid parcel|parcel of gas]].

== Definition ==
A formal definition from the ''Glossary of Meteorology''&lt;ref name="Glossary of Meteorology"&gt;{{cite book|author=Todd S. Glickman|title=Glossary of Meteorology|edition=2nd|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]], [[Boston]]|date=June 2000|isbn=1-878220-34-9}} [http://www.ametsoc.org/pubs/glossary_index.html (Glossary of Meteorology)]&lt;/ref&gt; is:
:The decrease of an atmospheric variable with height, the variable being temperature unless otherwise specified.

In general, a lapse rate is the negative of the rate of temperature change with altitude change, thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = -\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}z}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) is the lapse rate given in [[physical unit|unit]]s of temperature divided by units of altitude, ''T'' is temperature, and ''z'' is altitude.{{efn|Note: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are both used in this article but with very distinct meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Salomons, Erik M. | title=Computational Atmospheric Acoustics | edition=1st | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers| year=2001 | isbn=1-4020-0390-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Stull, Roland B. | title=An Introduction to Boundary Layer Meteorology | edition=1st | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers| year=2001 | isbn=90-277-2769-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Convection and adiabatic expansion ==
[[File:Emagram.GIF|thumb|350px|right|[[Emagram]] diagram showing variation of dry adiabats (bold lines) and moist adiabats (dash lines) according to pressure and temperature]]

The temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of an interaction between [[radiation]] and [[convection]]. Sunlight hits the ground and heats it. The ground then heats the air at the surface. If [[radiation]] were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space, the [[greenhouse effect]] of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly {{convert|333|K|C F}}, and the temperature would decay exponentially with height.&lt;ref name=goodywilson&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard M.|last1=Goody|first2=James C.G.|last2=Walker|title=Atmospheres|chapter=Atmospheric Temperatures|chapterurl=http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/3720/GoodyWalker/AtmosCh3sm.pdf|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when air is hot, it tends to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward. This is the process of [[convection]]. Convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel of air at a given altitude has the same density as the other air at the same elevation.

When a parcel of air expands, it pushes on the air around it, doing [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] (thermodynamics). Since the parcel does work but gains no heat, it loses [[internal energy]] so that its temperature decreases. The process of expanding and contracting without exchanging heat is an [[adiabatic process]]. The term ''adiabatic'' means that no heat transfer occurs into or out of the parcel. Air has low [[thermal conductivity]], and the bodies of air involved are very large, so transfer of heat by [[heat conduction|conduction]] is negligibly small.

The adiabatic process for air has a characteristic temperature-pressure curve, so the process determines the lapse rate. When the air contains little water, this lapse rate is known as the dry adiabatic lapse rate: the rate of temperature decrease is {{nowrap|9.8&amp;nbsp;°C/km}} ({{nowrap|5.38&amp;nbsp;°F}} per 1,000&amp;nbsp;ft) (3.0&amp;nbsp;°C/1,000&amp;nbsp;ft). The reverse occurs for a sinking parcel of air.&lt;ref name="DLA"&gt;Danielson, Levin, and Abrams, ''Meteorology'', McGraw Hill, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the [[troposphere]] (up to approximately {{convert|12|km|ft}} of altitude) in the Earth's atmosphere undergoes [[convection]]: the [[stratosphere]] does not generally convect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/stratosphere-overview|title=The stratosphere: overview|publisher=UCAR|accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some exceptionally energetic convection processes -- notably volcanic [[Eruption column|eruption columns]] and [[Overshooting top|overshooting tops]] associated with severe [[supercell thunderstorms]] -- may ''locally'' and ''temporarily'' inject convection through the [[tropopause]] and into the stratosphere.

== Mathematics of the adiabatic lapse rate==
These calculation use a very simple model of an atmosphere, either dry or moist, within a still vertical column at equilibrium. 

===Dry adiabatic lapse rate===
Thermodynamics defines an adiabatic process as:
:&lt;math&gt;P \mathrm{d}V = -\frac{V \mathrm{d}P}{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;m c_\text{v} \mathrm{d}T - \frac{V \mathrm{d}P}{\gamma} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Also, since &lt;math&gt;\alpha = V/m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma = c_\text{p}/c_\text{v}&lt;/math&gt;, we can show that:
:&lt;math&gt;c_\text{p} \mathrm{d}T - \alpha \mathrm{d}P = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c_\text{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat]] at constant pressure and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific volume]].

Assuming an atmosphere in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]:&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;Landau and Lifshitz, ''Fluid Mechanics'', Pergamon, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}P = -\rho g \mathrm{d}z&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the [[standard gravity]] and ''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;'' is the density. Combining these two equations to eliminate the pressure, one arrives at the result for the dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kittel|last2=Kroemer|title=Thermal Physics|publisher=Freeman|year=1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c0R79nyOoNMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Kittel%20and%20Kroemer%2C%20Thermal%20Physics%2C&amp;pg=PA179#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=6}} problem 11&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_\text{d} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}z} = \frac{g}{c_\text{p}} = 9.8\ ^{\circ}\text{C}/\text{km}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Moist adiabatic lapse rate  ===

The presence of water within the atmosphere(usually the troposphere) complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent [[heat of vaporization]]. As a parcel of air rises and cools, it eventually becomes [[Dew point|saturated]]; that is, the vapor pressure of water in equilibrium with liquid water has decreased (as temperature has decreased) to the point where it is equal to the actual vapor pressure of water. With further decrease in temperature the water vapor in excess of the equilibrium amount condenses, forming [[cloud]], and releasing heat (latent heat of condensation). Before saturation, the rising air follows the dry adiabatic lapse rate. After saturation, the rising air follows the moist adiabatic lapse rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meteorologytraining.tpub.com/14312/css/14312_47.htm |title=Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate |publisher=tpub.com |accessdate=2016-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603041448/http://meteorologytraining.tpub.com/14312/css/14312_47.htm |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of latent heat is an important source of energy in the development of thunderstorms.

While the dry adiabatic lapse rate is a constant {{nowrap|9.8&amp;nbsp;°C/km}} ({{nowrap|5.38&amp;nbsp;°F}} per 1,000&amp;nbsp;ft, {{nowrap|3&amp;nbsp;°C/1,000&amp;nbsp;ft}}), the moist adiabatic lapse rate varies strongly with temperature. A typical value is around {{nowrap|5&amp;nbsp;°C/km}}, ({{nowrap|9&amp;nbsp;°F/km}}, {{nowrap|2.7&amp;nbsp;°F/1,000&amp;nbsp;ft}}, {{nowrap|1.5&amp;nbsp;°C/1,000&amp;nbsp;ft}}).&lt;ref name="MLM"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minder|first1=JR|first2=PW|last2=Mote|first3=JD|last3=Lundquist|year=2010|title=Surface temperature lapse rates over complex terrain: Lessons from the Cascade Mountains|journal=J.

== Environmental lapse rate ==
The environmental lapse rate (ELR), is the rate of decrease of temperature with altitude in the stationary atmosphere at a given time and location. As an average, the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) defines an [[international standard atmosphere]] (ISA) with a temperature lapse rate of {{nowrap|6.49&amp;nbsp;K/km}}&lt;ref name="ICAO 1993"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=[[International Civil Aviation Organization]]|title=Manual of the ICAO Standard Atmosphere (extended to 80 kilometres (262 500 feet))|id=Doc 7488-CD|edition=Third|year=1993|isbn=92-9194-004-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|(3.56&amp;nbsp;°F}} or {{nowrap|1.98&amp;nbsp;°C/1,000 ft)}} from sea level to 11&amp;nbsp;km {{nowrap|(36,090 ft}} or {{nowrap|6.8&amp;nbsp;mi)}}. From 11&amp;nbsp;km up to 20&amp;nbsp;km {{nowrap|(65,620 ft}} or {{nowrap|12.4&amp;nbsp;mi)}}, the constant temperature is {{nowrap|−56.5&amp;nbsp;°C}} {{nowrap|(−69.7&amp;nbsp;°F)}}, which is the lowest assumed temperature in the ISA. The [[ICAO Standard Atmosphere|standard atmosphere]] contains no moisture. Unlike the idealized ISA, the temperature of the actual atmosphere does not always fall at a uniform rate with height. For example, there can be an [[Temperature inversion|inversion]] layer in which the temperature increases with altitude.

== Effect on weather ==
[[File:Anvil shaped cumulus panorama edit crop.jpg|thumb|right|x150px|The latent heat of vaporization adds energy to clouds and storms.]]
The varying environmental lapse rates throughout the Earth's atmosphere are of critical importance in [[meteorology]], particularly within the [[troposphere]]. They are used to determine if the [[air parcel|parcel]] of rising air will rise high enough for its water to condense to form [[cloud]]s, and, having formed clouds, whether the air will continue to rise and form bigger shower clouds, and whether these clouds will get even bigger and form [[cumulonimbus cloud]]s (thunder clouds).

As unsaturated air rises, its temperature drops at the dry adiabatic rate.  The [[dew point]] also drops (as a result of decreasing air pressure) but much more slowly, typically about {{nowrap|−2&amp;nbsp;°C}} per 1,000&amp;nbsp;m. If unsaturated air rises far enough, eventually its temperature will reach its [[dew point]], and condensation will begin to form. This altitude is known as the [[lifting condensation level]] (LCL) when mechanical lift is present and the [[convective condensation level]] (CCL) when mechanical lift is absent, in which case, the parcel must be heated from below to its [[convective temperature]]. The [[cloud base]] will be somewhere within the layer bounded by these parameters.

The difference between the dry adiabatic lapse rate and the rate at which the [[dew point]] drops is around {{nowrap|8&amp;nbsp;°C}} per 1,000&amp;nbsp;m. Given a difference in temperature and [[dew point]] readings on the ground, one can easily find the LCL by multiplying the difference by 125 m/°C.

If the environmental lapse rate is less than the moist adiabatic lapse rate, the air is absolutely stable — rising air will cool faster than the surrounding air and lose [[buoyancy]]. This often happens in the early morning, when the air near the ground has cooled overnight. Cloud formation in stable air is unlikely.

If the environmental lapse rate is between the moist and dry adiabatic lapse rates, the air is conditionally unstable — an unsaturated parcel of air does not have sufficient buoyancy to rise to the LCL or CCL, and it is stable to weak vertical displacements in either direction. If the parcel is saturated it is unstable and will rise to the LCL or CCL, and either be halted due to an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion layer]] of [[convective inhibition]], or if lifting continues, deep, moist convection (DMC) may ensue, as a parcel rises to the [[level of free convection]] (LFC), after which it enters the [[free convective layer]] (FCL) and usually rises to the [[equilibrium level]] (EL).

If the environmental lapse rate is larger than the dry adiabatic lapse rate, it has a superadiabatic lapse rate, the air is absolutely unstable — a parcel of air will gain buoyancy as it rises both below and above the lifting condensation level or convective condensation level. This often happens in the afternoon mainly over land masses. In these conditions, the likelihood of [[cumulus cloud]]s, showers or even [[thunderstorm]]s is increased.

Meteorologists use [[radiosonde]]s to measure the environmental lapse rate and compare it to the predicted adiabatic lapse rate to forecast the likelihood that air will rise. Charts of the environmental lapse rate are known as [[thermodynamic diagrams]], examples of which include [[Skew-T log-P diagram]]s and [[tephigram]]s. (See also [[Thermals]]).

The difference in moist adiabatic lapse rate and the dry rate is the cause of [[foehn wind]] phenomenon (also known as "[[Chinook wind]]s" in parts of North America). The phenomenon exists because warm moist air rises through [[orographic lifting]] up and over the top of a mountain range or large mountain. The temperature decreases with the dry adiabatic lapse rate, until it hits the dew point, where water vapor in the air begins to condense. Above that altitude, the adiabatic lapse rate decreases to the moist adiabatic lapse rate as the air continues to rise. Condensation is also commonly followed by [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] on the top and [[windward]] sides of the mountain. As the air descends on the leeward side, it is warmed by [[adiabatic compression]] at the dry adiabatic lapse rate. Thus, the foehn wind at a certain altitude is warmer than the corresponding altitude on the windward side of the mountain range. In addition, because the air has lost much of its original water vapor content, the descending air creates an [[arid]] region on the leeward side of the mountain.&lt;ref name="Whiteman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Whiteman|first= C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4602">On June 23, 1942 the experimental early type of a nuclear reactor L-IV led to the first nuclear accident in history, consisting of steam explosion and reactor fire in [[Leipzig]], [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="zeit1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kretz|first1=Sebastian|title=Geschichte der Atomkraft: Der Urknall|url=http://www.zeit.de/2012/17/S-Kernforschung|publisher=Die Zeit|accessdate=11 February 2017|date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Leipzig L-IV [[atomic pile]]—worked on by [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Robert Döpel]]—demonstrated Germany's first signs of neutron propagation, the device was checked for a possible [[heavy water]] leak. During the inspection, air leaked in, igniting the uranium powder inside. The burning uranium boiled the water jacket, generating enough steam pressure to blow the reactor apart. Burning uranium powder scattered throughout the lab causing a larger fire at the facility.&lt;ref&gt;R. Döpel (1941 bzw. 1942), [http://www.deutsches-museum.de/archiv/archiv-online/geheimdokumente/forschungszentren/leipzig/unfaelle/dokument-1/ Beschreibung zweier Unfälle mit Uranoxid].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goudsmit |first=S. A. |date=November 1947 |title=Heisenberg on the German Uranium Project |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vA0AAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA343&amp;dq=Leipzig%20pile%20fire&amp;pg=PA343#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc. |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=343ff. |issn=0096-3402 |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This happened after 20 days of operation when Werner Paschen opened the machine at the request of Döpel after blisters formed at the gasket.&lt;ref name="zeit1"/&gt; As glowing Uranium powder shot to the 6 meter high ceiling and the apparatus heated up to 1.000 degree Heisenberg was asked for help but couldn't provide it.&lt;ref name="zeit1"/&gt;

==The experiment==
Results from trial L-IV, in the first half of 1942, indicated that the spherical geometry, with five metric tons of heavy water and 10 metric tons of metallic uranium, could sustain a fission reaction. So, "the Germans were the first physicists in the world, with their Leipzig pile L-IV, to achieve positive neutron production."&lt;ref&gt;Irving, D. J. C., ''The Virus House.'' London 1967. Paperback (with the text unchanged): ''The German Atomic Bomb.'' ''The History of Nuclear Research in Nazi Germany.'' New York 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The results were set forth in an article by [[Robert Döpel]], [[Klara Döpel]] and W. Heisenberg.&lt;ref&gt;R. Döpel, K. Döpel and W. Heisenberg: ''Der experimentelle Nachweis der effektiven Neutronenvermehrung in einem Kugel-Schichten-System aus D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O und Uran-Metall.'' In: Werner Heisenberg: ''Collected Works'' Bd. A II (Eds. W. Blum et al., Springer-Verl., Berlin 1989, S. 536-544. Online: [http://www.deutsches-museum.de/archiv/archiv-online/Geheimdokumente/forschungszentren/leipzig/neutronenvermehrung Research report 1942.]&lt;/ref&gt; The article was published at first in the ''[[Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte]]'' (''Research Reports in Nuclear Physics''), a classified internal reporting vehicle of the [[German nuclear energy project|Uranverein]].&lt;ref&gt;G-136 (July 1942), as cited in Walker, 1993, 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leipzig research group was led by Heisenberg until 1942 who in winter 1939/1940 reported on the possibilities and feasibility of energy extraction from Uranium for a Uranium-machine and [[nuclear bomb]]. After the report Heisenberg withdrew from practical experiments and left the execution of the experiments L-I, L-II, L-III and L-IV mostly up to his coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deutsches Museum: Forschungszentrum Leipzig|url=http://www.deutsches-museum.de/archiv/archiv-online/geheimdokumente/forschungszentren/leipzig/|website=www.deutsches-museum.de|publisher=Deutsches Museum|accessdate=11 February 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accident ended the Leipzig Uranium projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zu einem autobiographischen Brief von Robert Döpel an Fritz Straßmann|url=http://umweltfairaendern.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ArnoldHeinrich-Zu-einem-autobiographischen-Brief-von-Robert-Doepel-an-Fritz-Stratmann-ilm1-2012200288.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Methanogens''' are microorganisms that produce [[methane]] as a [[metabolic]] byproduct in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] conditions. They are prokaryotic and belong to the domain of [[archaea]]. They are common in [[wetland]]s, where they are responsible for [[marsh gas]], and in the digestive tracts of animals such as [[ruminant]]s and [[human]]s, where they are responsible for the methane content of [[belching]] in ruminants and [[flatulence]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;

==Physical description==

Methanogens are coccoid (spherical shaped) or bacilli (rod shaped). There are over 50 described species of methanogens, which do not form a [[monophyletic]] group, although all methanogens belong to [[Archaea]].  They are mostly [[anaerobic organism]]s that cannot function under aerobic conditions, but recently a species (''[[Candidatus]] [[Methanothrix paradoxum]]'') has been identified that can function in anoxic microsites within aerobic environments. They are very sensitive to the presence of [[oxygen]] even at trace level. Usually, they cannot sustain oxygen stress for a prolonged time. However, ''[[Methanosarcina barkeri]]'' is exceptional in possessing a [[superoxide dismutase]] (SOD) [[enzyme]], and may survive longer than the others in the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peters V |author2=Conrad R |date=1995 |title=Methanogenic and other strictly anaerobic bacteria in desert soil and other oxic sois |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=1673–1676|pmid=16535011 |pmc=1388429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacecenter.uark.edu/JillJabstract.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327135553/http://spacecenter.uark.edu/JillJabstract.doc |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some methanogens, called [[hydrogenotroph]]ic, use [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a source of carbon, and [[hydrogen]] as a [[reducing agent]].

The reduction of [[carbon dioxide]] into [[methane]] in the presence of [[hydrogen]] can be expressed as follows:

:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Some of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reacted with the hydrogen to produce methane, which creates an [[electrochemical gradient]] across cell membrane, used to generate [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] through [[chemiosmosis]]. In contrast, [[plant]]s and [[algae]] use water as their [[reducing agent]].

Methanogens lack [[peptidoglycan]], a polymer that is found in the [[cell wall]]s of the [[Bacteria]] but not in those of Archaea. Some methanogens have a cell wall that is composed of [[pseudopeptidoglycan]]. Other methanogens do not, but have at least one [[paracrystalline]] array (S-layer) made up of [[protein]]s that fit together like a [[jigsaw puzzle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00495/abstract|title=Bergey's Manual of Systematics of Archaea and Bacteria|last=Boone|first=David R.|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9781118960608|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00495/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extreme living areas==
Methanogens play the vital ecological role in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic environments]] of removing excess hydrogen and fermentation products that have been produced by other forms of [[anaerobic respiration]]. Methanogens typically thrive in environments in which all [[electron acceptor]]s other than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (such as [[oxygen]], [[nitrate]],  ferric[[iron]] (Fe(III)), and [[sulfate]]) have been depleted.  In deep [[basalt]]ic rocks near the [[mid ocean ridge]]s, they can obtain their [[hydrogen]] from the [[Serpentinite#Serpentinite reactions|serpentinisation]] reaction of [[olivine]] as observed in the [[Lost City (hydrothermal field)|hydrothermal field of Lost City]].

The thermal breakdown of water and water [[radiolysis]] are other possible sources of hydrogen.

Methanogens are key agents of remineralization of [[organic carbon]] in [[continental margin]] sediments and other aquatic sediments with high rates of sedimentation and high sediment organic matter.  Under the correct conditions of pressure and temperature, biogenic methane can accumulate in massive deposits of [[methane clathrate]]s,&lt;ref name="Kvenvolden 1995"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kvenvolden| first= K.| date=1995| title= A review of the geochemistry of methane in natural gas hydrate| journal= Organic Geochemistry| volume=23| issue=11–12| pages=997–1008| doi= 10.1016/0146-6380(96)00002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which account for a significant fraction of organic carbon in continental margin sediments and represent a key reservoir of a potent greenhouse gas.&lt;ref name="Milkov 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milkov| first=Alexei V| date=2004| title= Global estimates of hydrate-bound gas in marine sediments: how much is really out there?| journal= Earth-Science Reviews| volume=66| issue=3–4| pages=183–197| doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2003.11.002| bibcode=2004ESRv...66..183M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methanogens have been found in several extreme environments on Earth – buried under kilometres of ice in [[Greenland]] and living in hot, dry desert soil. They are known to be the most common archaebacteria in deep subterranean habitats. Live microbes making methane were found in a glacial ice core sample retrieved from about three kilometres under Greenland by researchers from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. They also found a constant metabolism able to repair macromolecular damage, at temperatures of 145 to –40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0507601102|title=Microbial origin of excess methane in glacial ice and implications for life on Mars|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=102|issue=51|pages=18292|year=2005|last1=Tung|first1=H.

Another study&lt;ref&gt;Icarus (vol. 178, p. 277)cs:Methanogen&lt;/ref&gt; has also discovered methanogens in a harsh environment on Earth. Researchers studied dozens of soil and vapour samples from five different desert environments in [[Utah]], [[Idaho]] and [[California]] in the [[United States]], and in [[Canada]] and [[Chile]]. Of these, five soil samples and three vapour samples from the vicinity of the [[Mars Desert Research Station]] in Utah were found to have signs of viable methanogens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientistspace.com/article/dn8428-extreme-bugs-back-idea-of-life-on-mars.html Extreme bugs back idea of life on Mars]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists have proposed that the presence of methane in the [[Mars|Martian]] atmosphere may be indicative of native methanogens on that planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/051220_science_tuesday.html|title=Crater Critters: Where Mars Microbes Might Lurk|work=Space.com|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related to the methanogens are the anaerobic methane oxidizers, which utilize methane as a substrate in conjunction with the reduction of sulfate and nitrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/440878a | author=Thauer, R. K. |author2=Shima, S. |last-author-amp=yes | title=Biogeochemistry: Methane and microbes | journal = Nature | date = 2006 | volume = 440 | issue =  7086| pages=878–879 | pmid=16612369 |bibcode = 2006Natur.440..878T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most methanogens are [[autotrophic]] producers, but those that [[oxidize]] CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are classed as [[chemotroph]] instead.

==Comparative genomics and molecular signatures==

Comparative genomic analysis has led to the identification of 31 signature proteins which are specific for the methanogens (also known as ''Methanoarchaeota''). Most of these proteins are related to methanogenesis, and they could serve as potential molecular markers for the methanogens.&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gao B |author2=Gupta RS |date=2007 |title=Phylogenomic analysis of proteins that are distinctive of Archaea and its main subgroups and the origin of methanogenesis |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=8 |page=86 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-8-86 |pmid=17394648 |pmc=1852104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 10 proteins found in all methanogens which are shared by ''[[Archaeoglobus]]'', suggest that these two groups are related.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt; In phylogenetic trees, the methanogens are not monophyletic and they are generally split into three clades.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gribaldo S |author2=Brochier-Armanet C |title=The origin and evolution of Archaea: a state of the art |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |date=2006 |volume=361 |issue=1470 |pages=1007–1022 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1841 |pmid=16754611 |pmc=1578729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the unique shared presence of large numbers of proteins by all methanogens could be due to lateral gene transfers.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

== Metabolism ==

=== Methane production ===
Methanogens are known to produce methane from substrates such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, acetate, formate, methanol and methylamines in a process called [[methanogenesis]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blaut|first=M.|date=1994|title=Metabolism of methanogens|journal=Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|volume=66|issue=1–3|pages=187–208|issn=0003-6072|pmid=7747931|doi=10.1007/bf00871639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different methanogenic reactions are catalyzed by unique sets of [[enzyme]]s and [[coenzymes]]. While reaction mechanism and energetics vary between one reaction and another, all of these reactions contribute to net positive energy production by creating ion [[concentration gradient]]s that are used to drive ATP synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dybas|first=M|last2=Konisky|first2=J|date=1992|title=Energy transduction in the methanogen Methanococcus voltae is based on a sodium current.|url=|journal=J Bacteriol|volume=174 | issue = 17 |pages=5575–5583|via=|doi=10.1128/jb.174.17.5575-5583.1992|pmc=206501}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall reaction for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanogenesis is:

:&lt;chem&gt;CO2 + 4 H2 -&gt; CH4 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt; (∆G˚’ = -134 kJ/mol CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)

Well-studied organisms that produce methane via H2/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanogenesis include ''Methanosarcina barkeri'', ''Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum'', and ''Methanobacterium wolfei''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karrasch|first=M.|last2=Börner|first2=G.|last3=Enssle|first3=M.|last4=Thauer|first4=R.

In the earliest stage of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanogenesis, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binds to [[methylfuran]] (MF) and is reduced to formyl-MF. This [[Endergonic reaction|endergonic]] reductive process (∆G˚’= +16 kJ/mol) is dependent on the availability of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and is catalyzed by the enzyme formyl-MF dehydrogenase.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;CO2 + H2 + MF -&gt; HCO-MF + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The formyl constituent of formyl-MF is then transferred to the coenzyme [[tetrahydromethanopterin]] (H4MPT) and is catalyzed by a soluble enzyme known as [[Formyltransferase|formyl transferase]].  This results in the formation of formyl-H4MPT.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;HCO-MF + H4MPT -&gt; HCO-H4MPT + MF&lt;/chem&gt;

Formyl-H4MPT is subsequently reduced to methenyl-H4MPT. Methenyl-H4MPT then undergoes a one-step hydrolysis followed by a two-step reduction to methyl-H4MPT. The two-step reversible reduction is assisted by [[Coenzyme F420|coenzyme F&lt;sub&gt;420&lt;/sub&gt;]] whose hydride acceptor spontaneously oxidizes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Once oxidized, F&lt;sub&gt;420&lt;/sub&gt;’s electron supply is replenished by accepting electrons from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This step is catalyzed by methylene H4MPT dehydrogenase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zirngibl|first=C|date=February 1990|title=N5,N10-Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum has hydrogenase activity|url=|journal=Laboratorium fir Mikrobiologie|volume=261 | issue = 1 |pages=112–116|via=|doi=10.1016/0014-5793(90)80649-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wastewater treatment===
Methanogens are widely used in anaerobic digestors to treat wastewater as well as aqueous organic pollutants. Industries have selected methanogens for their ability to perform [[biomethanation]] during wastewater decomposition thereby rendering the process sustainable and cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;Appels, Lise; et.al. (2008). "Principles and potential of the anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge" Progress in Energy and Combustion Science. 34 (6): 755 -781. doi: 10.1016/j.pecs.2008.06.002&lt;/ref&gt;

Bio-decomposition in the anaerobic digester involves a four-staged cooperative action performed by different microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Thomas H; et.al. (2010). "Anaerobic Digestion: Process" Solid Waste Technology &amp; Management, Volume 1 &amp; 2. doi: 10.1002/9780470666883.ch372&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage is the hydrolysis of insoluble polymerized organic matter by anaerobes such as Streptococcus and Enterobacterium.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Fayyaz Ali, et. al. (2014). “Microbial Ecology of Anaerobic Digesters: The Key Players of Anaerobiosis” ScientificWorldJournal. 3852369 (1). doi:10.1155/2014/183752&lt;/ref&gt; In the second stage, acidogens breakdown dissolved organic pollutants in wastewater to [[fatty acids]]. In the third stage, acetogens convert fatty acids to [[acetates]]. In the final stage, methanogens metabolize acetates to gaseous [[methane]]. The byproduct methane leaves the aqueous layer and serves as an energy source to power wastewater-processing within the digestor, thus generating a self-sustaining mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lettinga | first1 = G | year = 1995 | title = Anaerobic Digestion and Wastewater Treatment Systems | url = | journal = Antonie van Leeuwenhoek | volume = 67 | issue = 1| pages = 3–28 | doi = 10.1007/bf00872193 | pmid = 7741528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methanogens also effectively decrease the concentration of organic matter in wastewater run-off and minimizes [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="doi_10.1016/j.procbio.2010.05.017"/&gt; For instance, agricultural wastewater, highly rich in organic material, has been a major cause of aquatic ecosystem degradation. The chemical imbalances can lead to severe ramifications such as [[eutrophication]]. Through anaerobic digestion, the purification of wastewater can prevent unexpected blooms in water systems as well as trap [[methanogenesis]] within digesters. This allocates biomethane for energy production and prevents a potent greenhouse gas, methane, from being released into the atmosphere.

The organic components of wastewater vary vastly. Chemical structures of the organic matter select for specific methanogens to perform anaerobic digestion. An example is the members of [[Methanosaeta]] genus dominate the digestion of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and brewery waste.&lt;ref name="doi_10.1016/j.procbio.2010.05.017"/&gt; Modernizing wastewater treatment systems to incorporate higher diversity of microorganisms to decrease organic content in treatment is under active research in the field of microbiological and chemical engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Marihiro, Takashi., Sekiguchi, Yuji.

'''Mott insulators''' are a class of materials that should [[electrical conductivity|conduct electricity]] under conventional [[electronic band structure|band theories]], but are [[electrical insulator|insulator]]s when measured (particularly at low temperatures). This effect is due to [[electron]]–electron interactions, which are not considered in conventional band theory.

The bandgap in a Mott insulator exists between bands of like character, such as 3d character, whereas the bandgap in [[charge transfer insulators]] exists between anion and cation states,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wyvern.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/f/lecture/srrc/SRRC_Mott.pdf lecture slides]&lt;/ref&gt; such as between O 2p and Ni 3d bands in [[Nickel(II) oxide|NiO]].

==History==
Although the band theory of solids had been very successful in describing various electrical properties of materials, in 1937 [[Jan Hendrik de Boer]] and [[Evert Verwey|Evert Johannes Willem Verwey]] pointed out that a variety of [[transition metal oxide]]s predicted to be conductors by [[Electronic band structure|band theory]] (because they have an odd number of electrons per unit cell) are insulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1088/0959-5309/49/4S/307 | last=de Boer | first=J. H. |author2=Verwey, E. J. W. | title=Semi-conductors with partially and with completely filled 3''d''-lattice bands | journal=Proceedings of the Physical Society | volume=49 | issue=4S | pages=59 | year=1937| bibcode=1937PPS....49...59B }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nevill Mott]] and [[Rudolf Peierls]] then (also in 1937) predicted that this anomaly can be explained by including interactions between electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1088/0959-5309/49/4S/308 | last=Mott | first=N. F. |author2=Peierls, R. | title=Discussion of the paper by de Boer and Verwey | journal=Proceedings of the Physical Society | volume=49 | issue=4S | pages=72 | year=1937 |bibcode = 1937PPS....49...72M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, in particular, Mott proposed a model for [[nickel(II) oxide|NiO]] as an insulator, where conduction is based on the formula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1088/0370-1298/62/7/303 | last=Mott | first=N. F. | title=The basis of the electron theory of metals, with special reference to the transition metals | journal=Proceedings of the Physical Society | series = Series A | volume=62 | issue=7 | pages=416 | year=1949 |bibcode = 1949PPSA...62..416M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:(Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; + Ni&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;.

In this situation, the formation of an energy gap preventing conduction can be understood as the competition between the [[Coulomb potential]] ''U'' between 3''d'' electrons and the transfer integral ''t'' of 3''d'' electrons between neighboring atoms (the transfer integral is a part of the [[Tight binding (physics)|tight-binding]] approximation). The total [[energy gap]] is then

:''E''&lt;sub&gt;gap&lt;/sub&gt; = ''U'' &amp;minus; 2''zt'',

where ''z'' is the number of nearest-neighbor atoms.

In general, Mott insulators occur when the repulsive Coulomb potential ''U'' is large enough to create an energy gap. One of the simplest theories of Mott insulators is the 1963 [[Hubbard model]]. The crossover from a metal to a Mott insulator as ''U'' is increased can be predicted within the so-called [[dynamical mean field theory]].

==Mottness==
''Mottism'' denotes the additional ingredient, aside from [[antiferromagnetic]] ordering, which is necessary to fully describe a Mott Insulator.  In other words, we might write

:''antiferromagnetic order + mottism = Mott insulator''

Thus, mottism accounts for all of the properties of Mott insulators that cannot be attributed simply to antiferromagnetism.

There are a number of properties of Mott insulators, derived from both experimental and theoretical observations, which cannot be attributed to antiferromagnetic ordering and thus constitute mottism.  These properties include

*Spectral weight transfer on the Mott scale &lt;ref name="Phillips" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meinders" /&gt;
*Vanishing of the single particle [[Green's function (many-body theory)|Green function]] along a connected surface in momentum space in the [[Brillouin zone|first Brillouin zone]] &lt;ref name="Stanescu" /&gt;
*''Two'' sign changes of the [[Hall effect|Hall coefficient]] as electron [[doping (semiconductors)|doping]] goes from &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; ([[Electronic band structure|band insulators]] have only one sign change at &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;)
*The presence of a charge &lt;math&gt;2e&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;e&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; the charge of an electron) boson at low energies &lt;ref name="Leigh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Choy" /&gt;
*A pseudogap away from half-filling (&lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;ref name="Stanescu2" /&gt;

==Applications==

Mott insulators are of growing interest in advanced [[physics]] research, and are not yet fully understood. They have applications in [[thin-film]] [[magnetic]] [[heterostructure]]s and [[high-temperature superconductivity]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  last=Kohsaka | first = Y. |author2=Taylor, C. |author3=Wahl, P. | title=How Cooper pairs vanish approaching the Mott insulator in Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CaCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8+''&amp;delta;''&lt;/sub&gt; | journal=Nature | volume=454 |pages=1072&amp;ndash;1078 | date=August 28, 2008 | doi=10.1038/nature07243 |  pmid=18756248 |  issue=7208 |bibcode = 2008Natur.454.1072K |display-authors=etal|arxiv=0808.3816 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]] can become a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] by changing some parameters, which may be composition, pressure, strain, voltage, or magnetic field. The effect is known as a [[Mott transition]] and can be used to build smaller [[field-effect transistor]]s, [[switch]]es and memory devices than possible with conventional materials.&lt;ref&gt;Newns, Dennis (2000).

'''Multiple-effect humidification''' ('''MEH''') is a method used for thermal [[Water desalination|desalination]] of [[sea water]]. It uses multiple [[evaporation]]–[[condensation]] cycles at separate [[temperature]] levels to minimize the total [[energy consumption]] of [[solar humidification]] processes.&lt;ref name="MEH"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mediatum2.ub.tum.de/node?id=601861 | title=Multiple Effect Humidification Dehumidification at ambient pressure: Optimisation and applications | publisher=Technical University of Munich | year=2002 | accessdate=October 25, 2012 | author=Müller-Holst, Hendrik | language=German, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[hydraulic]] circuit, '''net positive suction head''' ('''NPSH''') may refer to one of two quantities in the analysis of [[cavitation]]:
# The Available NPSH (NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;): a measure of how close the fluid at a given point is to [[Flash evaporation|flashing]], and so to cavitation.Technically it is the absolute pressure head  minus the Vapour Pressure of the liquid.
# The Required NPSH (NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;): the head value at the suction side (e.g. the inlet of a pump) required to keep the fluid from cavitating(provided by the manufacturer)

NPSH is particularly relevant inside [[centrifugal pump]]s and [[turbine]]s, which are parts of a hydraulic system that are most vulnerable to cavitation. If cavitation occurs, the [[drag coefficient]] of the [[impeller]] vanes will increase drastically—possibly stopping flow altogether—and prolonged exposure will damage the impeller.

== NPSH in a pump ==
[[File:Simple_pump_schematic.svg|thumb|300px|A simple hydraulic pumping circuit. Point 0 is the free suction surface, and point i is the inlet of the impeller.]]

In a pump, cavitation will first occur at the inlet of the impeller.&lt;ref name="fmw"&gt;Frank M. White ''Fluid Mechanics'', 7th Ed., p. 771&lt;/ref&gt; Denoting the inlet by ''i'', the NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; at this point is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;\text{NPSH}_A = \left( \frac{p_i}{\rho g} + \frac{V_i^2}{2 g} \right) - \frac{p_{v}}{\rho g}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Pressure_measurement#Absolute.2C_gauge_and_differential_pressures_.E2.80.94_zero_reference|absolute pressure]] at the inlet, &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; is the average velocity at the inlet, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid density, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of gravity and &lt;math&gt;p_v&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vapor pressure]] of the fluid. Note that it is equivalent to the sum of both the static and dynamic heads – that is, the stagnation head – from which one deducts the head corresponding to the equilibrium vapor pressure, hence "net positive suction head".

Applying the [[first law of thermodynamics]] for control volumes enclosing the suction free surface '''0''' and the pump inlet ''i'', under the assumption that the kinetic energy at '''0''' is negligible, that the fluid is inviscid, and that the fluid density is constant:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_{0}}{\rho g} + z_{0} = \frac{p_i}{\rho g} + \frac{V_i^2}{2 g} + z_i + h_f&lt;/math&gt;

Using the above application of Bernoulli to eliminate the velocity term and local pressure terms in the definition of NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Net Possitive Suction Head}_A = \frac{p_{0}}{\rho g} - \frac{p_{v}}{\rho g} - ( z_i - z_{0}  ) - h_f&lt;/math&gt;

This is the standard expression for the available NPSH at point. Cavitation will occur at the point ''i'' when the available NPSH is less than the NPSH required to prevent cavitation (NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;). For simple impeller systems, NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; can be derived theoretically,&lt;ref&gt;Paresh Girdhar, Octo Moniz, ''Practical Centrifugal Pumps'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; but very often it is determined empirically.&lt;ref name="fmw" /&gt; Note NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;and NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; are in absolute units and usually expressed in "m abs" not "psia".

Experimentally, NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is often defined as the NPSH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the point at which the head output of the pump decreases by 3 % at a given flow due to reduced hydraulic performance. On multi-stage pumps this is limited to a 3 % drop in the first stage head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pumps.org/content_detail.aspx?id=1770|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323082902/http://www.pumps.org/content_detail.aspx?id=1770|archive-date=2010-03-23|title=Welcome to the Hydraulic Institute|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NPSH in a turbine==
The calculation of NPSH in a [[reaction turbine]] is different to the calculation of NPSH in a pump, because the point at which cavitation will first occur is in a different place. In a reaction turbine, cavitation will first occur at the outlet of the impeller, at the entrance of the [[draft tube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cavitation in reaction turbines|url=http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/courses/Webcourse-contents/IIT-KANPUR/machine/ui/Course_home-lec31.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310134349/http://nptel.ac.in/courses/Webcourse-contents/IIT-KANPUR/machine/ui/Course_home-lec31.htm|archive-date=2016-03-10|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denoting the entrance of the draft tube by ''e'', the NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined in the same way as for pumps:

&lt;math&gt;\text{NPSH}_A = \left( \frac{p_e}{\rho g} + \frac{V_e^2}{2 g} \right) - \frac{p_{v}}{\rho g}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="fmw" /&gt;

Applying [[Bernoulli's principle]] from the draft tube entrance ''e'' to the lower free surface '''0''', under the assumption that the kinetic energy at '''0''' is negligible, that the fluid is inviscid, and that the fluid density is constant:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{p_e}{\rho g} + \frac{V_e^2}{2 g} + z_e = \frac{p_{0}}{\rho g} + z_{0} + h_f&lt;/math&gt;

Using the above application of Bernoulli to eliminate the velocity term and local pressure terms in the definition of NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\text{NPSH}_A = \frac{p_{0}}{\rho g} - \frac{p_{v}}{\rho g} - ( z_e - z_{0}  ) + h_f&lt;/math&gt;

Note that, in turbines minor losses (&lt;math&gt;h_f&lt;/math&gt;) alleviate the effect of cavitation - opposite to what happens in pumps.

== NPSH design considerations ==
[[Vapour pressure]] is strongly dependent on temperature, and thus so will both NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; and NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Centrifugal pump]]s are particularly vulnerable especially when pumping heated solution near the vapor pressure, whereas [[Pump#Positive displacement pump|positive displacement pumps]] are less affected by cavitation, as they are better able to pump two-phase flow (the mixture of gas and liquid), however, the resultant flow rate of the pump will be diminished because of the gas volumetrically displacing a disproportion of liquid. Careful design is required to pump high temperature liquids with a centrifugal pump when the liquid is near its boiling point.

The violent collapse of the cavitation bubble creates a shock wave that can carve material from internal pump components (usually the leading edge of the impeller) and creates noise often described as "pumping gravel".  Additionally, the inevitable increase in vibration can cause other mechanical faults in the pump and associated equipment.

== Relationship to other cavitation parameters ==
The NPSH appears in a number of other cavitation-relevant parameters. The suction head coefficient is a [[dimensionless]] measure of NPSH:

&lt;math&gt;C_\text{NPSH} = \frac{g\cdot\text{NPSH}}{n^2 D^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the angular velocity (in rad/s) of the turbo-machine shaft, and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the turbo-machine impeller diameter. [[Thoma's cavitation number]] is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{\text{NPSH}}{H}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the head across the turbo-machine.

== Some general NPSH examples ==

(based on sea level).

'''Example 1:'''   A tank with a liquid level 2 metres above the pump intake, plus the [[atmospheric pressure]] of 10 metres, minus a 2 metre [[friction loss]] into the pump (say for pipe &amp; valve loss), minus the NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; curve (say 2.5 metres) of the pre-designed pump (see the manufacturers curve) = an NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; (available) of 7.5 metres. (not forgetting the flow duty). This equates to 3 times the NPSH required. This pump will operate well so long as all other parameters are correct.

Remember that positive or negative flow duty will change the reading on the pump manufacture NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; curve.  The lower the flow, the lower the NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, and vice versa.

Lifting out of a well will also create negative NPSH; however remember that atmospheric pressure at sea level is 10 metres! This helps us, as it gives us a bonus boost or “push” into the pump intake. (Remember that you only have 10 metres of atmospheric pressure as a bonus and nothing more!).

'''Example 2:'''   A well or bore with an operating level of 5 metres below the intake, minus a 2 metre friction loss into pump (pipe loss), minus the NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; curve (say 2.4 metres) of the pre-designed pump = an NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; (available) of (negative) -9.4 metres.   NOW we add the atmospheric pressure of 10 metres.  We have a positive NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.6 metres. (minimum requirement is 0.6 metres above NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;), so the pump should lift from the well.

Now we will try the situation from example 2 above, but will pump 70 degrees Celsius (158F) water from a hot spring, creating negative NPSH.

'''Example 3:'''   A well or bore running at 70 degrees Celsius (158F) with an operating level of 5 metres below the intake, minus a 2 metre friction loss into pump (pipe loss), minus the NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; curve (say 2.4 metres) of the pre-designed pump, minus a temperature loss of 3 metres/10 feet = an NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; (available) of (negative) -12.4 metres.   NOW we add the atmospheric pressure of 10 metres and we have a negative NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; of -2.4 metres remaining.

Remembering that the minimum requirement is 600&amp;nbsp;mm above the NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; therefore this pump will not be able to pump the 70 degree Celsius liquid and will cavitate and lose performance and cause damage.  To work efficiently, the pump must be buried in the ground at a depth of 2.4 metres plus the required 600&amp;nbsp;mm minimum, totalling a total depth of 3 metres into the pit. (3.5 metres to be completely safe).

A minimum of 600&amp;nbsp;mm (0.06 bar) and a recommended 1.5 metre (0.15 [[bar (unit)|bar]]) [[head pressure]] “higher” than the NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; pressure value required by the manufacturer is required to allow the pump to operate properly.

Serious damage may occur if a large pump has been sited incorrectly with an incorrect NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; value and this may result in a very expensive pump or installation repair.

NPSH problems may be able to be solved by changing the NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; or by re-siting the pump.

If an NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; is say 10 bar then the pump you are using will deliver exactly 10 bar more over the entire operational curve of a pump than its listed operational curve.

Example:  A pump with a max. pressure head of 8 bar (80 metres) will actually run at 18 bar if the NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; is 10 bar.

i.e.:    8 bar (pump curve) plus 10 bar NPSH&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = 18 bar.

This [[phenomenon]] is what manufacturers use when they design [[Centrifugal pump|multistage]] pumps, (Pumps with more than one impeller).  Each multi stacked impeller boosts the succeeding impeller to raise the pressure head.  Some pumps can have up to 150 stages or more, in order to boost heads up to hundreds of metres.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2034">The '''oka''', '''okka''', or '''oke''' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] اوقه) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] measure of [[mass]], equal to 400 [[dirham|dirhem]]s (Ottoman [[dram (unit)|dram]]s). Its value varied, but it was standardized in the late empire as 1.2829 [[kilogram]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]; but Kélékian gives 1.285 kg&lt;/ref&gt; 'Oka' is the most usual spelling today;  'oke' was the usual contemporary English spelling; 'okka' is the modern Turkish spelling, and is usually used in academic work about the Ottoman Empire.

In [[Turkey]], the traditional unit is now called the ''eski okka'' 'old oka' or ''kara okka'' 'black okka'; the ''yeni okka'' 'new okka' is the kilogram.&lt;ref&gt;Kélékian; Alderson&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greece]], the oka (οκά, plural οκάδες) was standardized at 1.282 [[kilogram|kg]] and remained in use until traditional units were abolished on March 31, 1953&lt;ref&gt;Babiniotis&lt;/ref&gt;—the [[SI|metric system]] had been adopted in 1876, but the older units remained in use.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cyprus]], the oka remained in use until the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Egypt]], the monetary oka weighted 1.23536 kg.  In [[Tripolitania]], it weighed 1.2208 kg, equal to 2½ [[artal]]s.

The oka was also used as a unit of [[volume]]. In [[Wallachia]], it was 1.283 [[liter]]s of liquid and 1.537 l of grain ([[dry measure]]). In Greece, an oka of [[olive oil|oil]] was 1.280 kg.

The submarines were built by students of the ''[[École de technologie supérieure]]'' (School of Higher Technology) in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], for the [[International Submarine Races]]. {{As of|2014}}, ''Omer'' teams hold the human-powered submarine world [[List of vehicle speed records|speed records]] for two-seater and non-propeller categories. Those records are :

*4.96 knots for ''Omer 11'' (one-seater / non-propeller)

''Omer 11'' is the latest generation of ''Omer'' submarine.

==History==

Since 1992, a group of students from the É.T.S. in electrical, mechanical, software and automated automation engineering have taken part in the completion of ''Omer'', a [[human-powered submarine]]. The first generation of ''Omer'' was a two-seater submarine that made its mark around the world. Despite the students' efforts and with numerous prizes and awards in conception and innovation, ''Omer'' was not the world's fastest submarine. Otherwise, at the first presence of the ''Omer'' team, a [[variable pitch]] system was operational and gave good performances and helped the next ''Omer'' submarines to increase their speed.

In September 1995, the team decided that ''Omer'' would become the world's champion. With new members' ideas and older members' expertise, ''Omer 2'' was born. In four months, a new hull was made and a new onboard computer was added to control the variable pitch from the [[propeller]], and to give some information to the pilot as well. 

''Omer'' went to California for a competition in May 1996, where it won a world record in the two-seater category. With that victory in hand, the team decided to aim for first place in the one-seater category. Construction on ''Omer 3'' began.

The team found success in Washington in June 1997, winning world record in all categories. In the summer of 2001, ''Omer 4'' was set to beat the previous world record of 7.192 knots. Since then, a new electrical control system has been tested and integrated for the 2002 competition in California.

Since their creation, ''Omer'', ''Omer 2'' and ''Omer 3'' had a lot of visibility in the media, and gained offers of help from individuals and corporations.

In the summer of 2003, ''Omer 5'', the new two-seater submarine took first place again using the experience acquired from ''Omer 4''. The new submarine is now much more stable than ''Omer 4''. In 2005, it beat the world speed record for a two-seater submarine setting the mark at 7.061 knots.

In the summer of 2007, the submarine ''Omer 5'' set the new world record reaching a speed of 8.035 knots. Omer 6 a submarine using non-propeller reach 4.642 knots, with   its driver Nicolas Tardif, setting also a world record for non-propeller submarine.

'''Pensacola Pass''', separating mainland Florida from [[Santa Rosa Island, Florida|Santa Rosa Island]], is the mouth of [[Pensacola Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;
   "Officials in Pensacola Bay frustrated with slow pace",
   ''[[Palm Beach Post]]'', 4 May 2010, webpage:
   [http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/officials-in-pensacola&lt;!--
   --&gt;-bay-frustrated-with-slow-pace-662094.html PBP-94].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Pensacola Pass forms a water passage that connects Pensacola Bay with the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south, in the U.S. state of [[Florida]], east of the Alabama/Florida state line. The surrounding area is heavily developed, with high-rise [[condominium]]s. However, there are nearby beach-front parks, with [[Fort Pickens]] on the eastern side of Pensacola Pass.

==Description==
Pensacola Pass is the name of the waterway connecting the Gulf to Pensacola Bay. Ships and boats use this passage to travel between the two. During the daily [[Tide# Phase and amplitude|flood tide]], fresh saltwater enters Pensacola Pass from the Gulf of Mexico; waters are pulled out on the ebb tide, flushing the bay.

==2010 Gulf oil spill==
Following the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] (called the "Gulf oil spill"), the entrance to Pensacola Pass was closed,&lt;ref&gt;
   "Unified Command for the BP Oil Spill | Pensacola Pass to Close",
   [http://www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com/go/doc/2931/652927/ DH-27].
&lt;/ref&gt;
with a floating barrier system in June 2010, to control tidal flow of oil entering from the Gulf of Mexico. The daily [[high tide]] was causing oil-contaminated water to enter [[Pensacola Bay]]. The barrier system was to be  designed to allow boats to travel through Pensacola Pass during the ebb tide, but to close during the rising tide.

Although this was the initial plan, the booming plan was never fully implemented. Due to strong currents in the Pass, the boom broke. There was no alternative system in place in areas of less current, nor was there a plan to trap incoming oil, therefore oil product freely entered the Pass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santarosa.fl.gov/libraries/documents/Gulf%20Breeze%20(City%20of)%20Deepwater%20Horizon%20Final%20Report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Professional Electrical Apparatus Reconditioning League''' or '''PEARL''' is an international professional organization and standards group based in [[Denver, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pearl1.org/about-us.htm "About PEARL"], ''pearl1.org''&lt;/ref&gt; PEARL is focused on developing ethical business practices and technical standards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pearl1.org/PEARL_reconditioning_standards.htm "PEARL Recondition Standards for Electrical Equipment"], ''pearl1.org''&lt;/ref&gt; related to inspecting, testing, and reconditioning [[circuit breakers]], [[transformer]], motor controls, [[switchgear]], disconnect switches, protective relays, [[bus duct]], motor starters and other [[electrical equipment]] and apparatus used in the [[electricity|electrical distribution]] systems of commercial, industrial, and utility facilities.

== PEARL and Electrical Safety ==

PEARL's standards for [http://www.pearl1.org/PEARL-inspect-test-reconditioning-standards.htm inspecting, testing and reconditioning electrical equipment], components and apparatus help ensure the reliable, safe operation of devices such as circuit breakers, transformers, switches, protective relays, and contactors.  PEARL also disseminates information on [http://www.pearl1.org/electrical-safety-news.htm electrical safety news and counterfeit notices] relating to electrical equipment utilized at commercial, industrial and utility facilities.

== PEARL is an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Developer of Reconditioning Standards ==

PEARL is an [http://www.pearl1.org/ansi/index.htm "American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Developer of Reconditioning Standards"] for returning electrical equipment to safe and reliable service. PEARL's goal is to develop a single set of consensus technical standards for reconditioning electrical equipment used in industrial and commercial installations and accepted by a pool of industry professionals and stakeholders.

To this end, PEARL is seeking qualified individuals to review and provide input and comment on new standards and any revision to a standard. These individuals will have expertise and knowledge of inspecting, testing and reconditioning electrical equipment used in industrial and commercial facilities.

== PEARL and Anti-Counterfeit Measures for Electrical Equipment ==

Counterfeit electrical apparatus pose a growing threat&lt;ref&gt;[http://counterfeitscankill.com/ "Anti-Counterfeit Products Initiative"], ''CounterfeitsCanKill.com''&lt;/ref&gt; to all sectors of the electrical marketplace, from the OEMs who lose revenue and brand prestige, to distributors and suppliers that risk liability, to electrical contractors end users who can face financial or physical liabilities as a result of potentially dangerous counterfeit electrical devices. Independent suppliers of electrical product are particularly susceptible to fraudulent counterfeit goods because most OEMs will not sell their 'new' product at wholesale prices directly to non-licensed distributors, forcing independent electrical supply houses to alternate sources.

In September 2007, PEARL held a special board meeting to discuss counterfeit electrical power equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pearl1.org/PEARL-News/counterfeit-electrical-products-subject-of-special-meeting.htm "Counterfeit Electrical Equipment Concerns Draw PEARL Members to a Special Meeting in Dallas"], ''pearl1.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Among other actions, PEARL's Standards and Practices Committee issued a policy directive to all members to pro-actively assist OEMs and other organizations with identifying, reporting, and policing counterfeit electrical product and the companies and individuals that sell it. Since 2007, PEARL members have helped OEMs and other industry associations locate several shipments of counterfeit product.

== Sponsored Events ==

PEARL sponsors an annual [http://www.pearl1.org/annual_conference.htm "Electrical Safety, Reliability and Sustainability Conference &amp; Exhibition.]
Conference topics include but are not limited to: 
*Electrical safety 
*Electrical failure diagnosis 
*Reconditioning, inspection and testing standards &amp; techniques 
*Counterfeiting issues
*Government regulations update 
*Hands-on training 
*Panel discussions

== PEARL and the Environment ==

In 2010 PEARL published a white paper [http://www.pearl1.org/downloads/Reconditioning-The-Ultimate-Form-of-Recycling_PEARL-WhitePaper-LowRes.pdf "Reconditioning: The Ultimate Form of Recycling"] outling how reuse, reconditioning, and remanufacturing use a fraction of the energy of new production, keep millions of tons of waste from landfills every year, reduce raw material consumption, and create 3 to 5 times more skilled jobs than automated production lines.

Because the remanufacturing process only consumes about 15% of the energy used to create a new product, remanufacturing in the U.S. saves 400 trillion BTUs annually, the equivalent of 16 million barrels of crude oil, or enough gasoline to run 6 million cars for a year. Based on a weighted average of 140 pounds of {{CO2}} gas pollution for every 1 million BTUs of energy consumed, remanufacturing reduces {{CO2}} generation by 28 million tons each year, which is equal to the {{CO2}} output of 10, 500-megawatt coal-burning electrical plants. Remanufacturing also saves the U.S. enough raw materials to fill 155,000 railway cars each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reman.org/pdf/mema2005.pdf "The Best Kept Secret to U.S. Economic Growth: Remanufacturing"], ''The Remanufacturing Institute - reman.org''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reman.org/pdf/IUbusinessHorizonsRemanufacturing.pdf "Remanufacturing: The Next Great Opportunity for Boosting US Productivity"], ''The Remanufacturing Institute - reman.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boston University]]'s Prof. Robert Lund estimated the U.S. remanufacturing industry at $53 billion in sales in 1996, employing approximately 480,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/reman/HGExecSum.pdf "The Remanufacturing Industry: Hidden Giant"], ''Boston University - bu.edu''&lt;/ref&gt; This figure only includes a portion of the electrical equipment market related to electrical motors, and doesn't include remanufacturing of other electrical products such as circuit breakers, transformers, etc. [[Remanufacturing]] electrical equipment keeps thousands of tons of waste from U.S. landfills every year, based on the inventory turnarounds shown just by PEARL member companies. Also, unlike [[recycling]] which only reclaims part of the materials within a waste stream, reconditioning reclaims more material savings, as well as most of the energy and labor energy used to manufacturer the original product, making reconditioning a more environmentally sustainable practice than recycling. In 2003, the OEM Product-Services Institute (OPI) said U.S. electrical generation facilities alone spent $3.1 billion on remanufacturing, overhaul, and rebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oemservices.org/pdf_files/RemanMarket.pdf "OPI Estimate of 2003 Annual US Expenditures on Remanufacturing/Overhaul/Rebuild"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119155207/http://www.oemservices.org/pdf_files/RemanMarket.pdf |date=2008-11-19 }}, ''OEMservices.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1980 and 1992, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] estimated that on average 411 workers died in the U.S. each year from [[electrocution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-131/epidemi.html "NIOSH Publication No. 98-131: Worker Deaths by Electrocution"], ''NIOSH - cdc.gov/niosh''&lt;/ref&gt; Safety of remanufactured electrical equipment is a prime focus of PEARL.

Although numbers on energy savings and pollution reduction thanks solely to electrical reconditioning do not exist, PEARL has recently been recognized by the [[California Integrated Waste Management Board]] (CIWMB) through its Waste Reduction Award Program (WRAP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pearl1.org/PEARL-News/PEARL-receives-award-for-recycling-reusing-electrical-equipment.htm "PEARL Wins California's Prestigious Environmental WRAP Award for Recycling, Reusing Electrical Apparatus"], ''pearl1.org''&lt;/ref&gt; as an organization that has help the state meet its waste reduction goals.

== History ==

PEARL's original corporate members first came together in Denver, CO, in 1996 to discuss emerging issues surrounding new [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI) systems for the ordering and purchase of electric apparatus and equipment for commercial and industrial markets. As a group, these independent suppliers of new, surplus, and used electrical apparatus and equipment for commercial and industrial electrical applications typically were neither members of horizontal electrical industry associations and standards organizations, such as the [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] (NEMA), who develops general electrical enclosure and interconnect standards for electrical original equipment manufacturers (OEM); nor vertical trade associations such as the Electrical Apparatus Service Association Inc. (EASA), which develops standards for servicing electrical motors, nor the [[International Electrical Testing Association]] (NETA), which develops standards for electrical field testing and field equipment maintenance. EASA and NETA would go on to become standards development groups for the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI).

Although OEMs of electrical equipment did develop maintenance and repair documents for their individual company products and offer for-fee [[remanufacturing]] services, neither OEM's nor their trade associations collected these repair documents, standardized the processes from different companies, validated the processes through third party engineering review, or offered them as a group of standards to the electrical industry at large. EASA had developed standards for rewinding electric motors, excluding motor control circuits, NETA had developed the standards to calibrate electrical test equipment used in both EASA and eventually PEARL standards, but in 1996, PEARL's founding members saw that the industry did not have the technical standards necessary to ensure the safety of reconditioned electrical equipment used by industrial and commercial industries, ranging from circuit breakers and transformer to conduit and bus duct.

As a result of these conditions within the electrical industry, In 1997, 20 charter members formed PEARL to collect, create, and disseminate information, policies, procedures, and standards to ensure the proper [[recycling]] and [[reuse]] of electrical power equipment, as well as to prevent fraudulent electrical apparatus labeling and misrepresentation of electrical equipment. As of May 25, 2009, PEARL's 51 corporate voting members and 30 affiliate members, representing more than $500 million in annual sales revenues from companies in the U.S. and Canada, have contributed to the development of 137 electrical Reconditioning Standards for Electrical Equipment ranging from circuit breakers and transformers to conduit and bus duct.

A '''stagecoach''' is a four-wheeled public [[coach (carriage)|coach]] used to carry paying passengers and light packages on journeys long enough to need a change of horses. It is strongly sprung and generally drawn by [[four-in-hand (carriage)| four horses]].

Widely used before [[History of rail transport|steam-powered rail transport]] was available a stagecoach made long scheduled trips using [[Stage station|''stage stations'']] or posts where the stagecoach's horses would be replaced by fresh horses. The business of running stagecoaches or the act of journeying in them was known as '''staging'''.&lt;ref name=StagecoachEast&gt;{{cite book | first=Oliver W. | last=Holmes | year=1983 | title=Stagecoach East | isbn=0-87474-522-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originating in England, familiar images of the stagecoach are that of a [[mail coach|Royal Mail coach]] passing through a [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] gate, a [[Dickensian]] passenger coach covered in snow pulling up at a [[coaching inn]], and a [[highwayman]] demanding a coach to "stand and deliver". The [[yard of ale]] drinking glass is associated by legend with stagecoach drivers, though it was mainly used for drinking feats and special toasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/652036/yard-of-ale-glass |title=Yard-of-ale glass (drinking glass) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=2010-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theyardofale.com/index.php/history/ |title=The Yard of Ale : Our History |publisher=www.theyardofale.com |accessdate=2010-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304113941/http://www.theyardofale.com/index.php/history/ |archivedate=2010-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The stagecoach was a closed four-wheeled [[vehicle]] drawn by [[horse]]s or hard-going [[mule]]s. It was used as a public conveyance on an established route usually to a regular schedule. Spent horses were replaced with fresh horses at [[stage station]]s, posts, or relays.                                   
[[File:Wells Fargo (6079160244).jpg|thumb|Wells Fargo mud-coach]]
A simplified and lightened form of stagecoach, known as a [[stage wagon]], mud-coach, or mud-wagon, was used in  the United States under difficult conditions. These were the vehicles that opened up the new stage routes in America's [[American West|West]]. In addition to the stage driver or coachman who guided the vehicle, a [[shotgun messenger]] armed with a [[coach gun]] might travel as a guard beside him.

A stagecoach traveled at an average speed of about {{convert|5|mph}}, with the average daily mileage covered being around {{convert|60|to|70|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM3A0A Waymarking.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abbreviation===
'Stage' originally referred to the distance between stage stations on a route but through [[metonymy]] it came to be applied to the stagecoach.

==History==

===Origins===
The first crude depiction of a coach was in an [[England|English]] manuscript from the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Olmert, Michael (1996). ''Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser &amp; Curiouser Adventures in History'', p.142. Simon &amp; Fille, New York. {{ISBN|0-684-80164-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first stagecoach route started in 1610 and ran from [[Edinburgh]] to [[Leith]]. This was followed by a steady proliferation of other routes around the island.&lt;ref name="Lay"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=flvS-nJga8QC|title=Ways of the World: A History of the World's Roads and of the Vehicles That Used Them|author=M. G. Lay|year=1992|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 17th century, a basic stagecoach infrastructure had been put in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=kwq#1973|title=History of transport and travel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A string of [[coaching inn]]s operated as stopping points for travellers on the route between [[London]] and [[Liverpool]]. The stagecoach would depart every Monday and Thursday and took roughly ten days to make the journey during the summer months. Stagecoaches also became widely adopted for travel in and around London by mid-century and generally travelled at a few miles per hour. [[Shakespeare]]'s first plays were performed at coaching inns such as [[The George Inn, Southwark]].

By the end of the 17th century stagecoach routes ran up and down the three main roads in England.&lt;ref name="awoodley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~awoodley/carriage/history.html|title=Coaching History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The London-York route was advertised in 1698:
:Whoever is desirous of going between London and York or York and London, Let them Repair to the Black Swan in Holboorn, or the Black Swan in Coney Street, York, where they will be conveyed in a Stage Coach (If God permits), which starts every Thursday at Five in the morning."

The novelty of this method of transport excited much controversy at the time. One pamphleteer denounced the stagecoach as a "great evil [...] mischievous to trade and destructive to the public health."&lt;ref name="awoodley" /&gt; Another writer, however, argued that:

:"Besides the excellent arrangement of conveying men and letters on horseback, there is of late such an admirable commodiousness, both for men and women, to travel from London to the principal towns in the country, that the like hath not been known in the world, and that is by stage-coaches, wherein any one may be transported to any place, sheltered from foul weather and foul ways; free from endamaging of one's health and one's body by the hard jogging or over-violent motion; and this not only at a low price (about a shilling for every five miles), but with such velocity and speed in one hour, as that the posts in some foreign countries make in a day."

The speed of travel remained constant until the mid-18th century. Reforms of the [[turnpike trusts]], new methods of [[History of road transport|road building]] and the improved construction of coaches led to a sustained rise in the comfort and speed of the average journey - from an average journey length of 2 days for the [[Cambridge]]-London route in 1750 to a length of under 7 hours in 1820.&lt;ref name="Lay" /&gt;

[[Robert Hooke]] helped in the construction of some of the first spring-suspended coaches in the 1660s and spoked wheels with iron rim brakes were introduced, improving the characteristics of the coach.&lt;ref name="Lay" /&gt;
[[File:John Charles Maggs - The Mail Coach.jpg|thumb|A Greyhound or Flying coach]]
In 1754, a [[Manchester]]-based company began a new service called the "Flying Coach". It was [[advertisement|advertised]] with the following announcement - "However incredible it may appear, this coach will actually (barring accidents) arrive in London in four days and a half after leaving Manchester." A similar service was begun from Liverpool three years later, using coaches with steel spring suspension. This coach took an unprecedented three days to reach London with an average speed of eight miles per hour.&lt;ref name="awoodley" /&gt;

===Royal Mail stagecoaches===
[[File:Houghton 44W-1384 - Pyne, Costume of Great Britain.jpg|right|thumb|Mail coach decorated in the black and maroon Post Office livery, 1804]]
[[File:The Public are Respectfully Informed that a neat and convenient stage coach..1831.jpg|thumb|A public notice advertising a new stage coach service in west [[Wales]], 1831]]
Even more dramatic improvements were made by [[John Palmer (postal innovator)|John Palmer]] at the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|British Post Office]]. The postal delivery service in Britain had existed in the same form for about 150 years—from its introduction in 1635, mounted carriers had ridden between "posts" where the postmaster would remove the letters for the local area before handing the remaining letters and any additions to the next rider. The riders were frequent targets for robbers, and the system was inefficient.&lt;ref name="PO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://postalheritage.org.uk/history/downloads/BPMA_Info_Sheet_MailCoaches_web.pdf | title=The Mail Coach Service | publisher=[[The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive]] | year=2005 | accessdate=21 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer made much use of the "flying" stagecoach services between cities in the course of his business, and noted that it seemed far more efficient than the system of mail delivery then in operation. His travel from Bath to London took a single day to the mail's three days. It occurred to him that this stagecoach service could be developed into a national mail delivery service, so in 1782 he suggested to the [[Royal Mail|Post Office]] in London that they take up the idea. He met resistance from officials who believed that the existing system could not be improved, but eventually the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[William Pitt the younger|William Pitt]], allowed him to carry out an experimental run between Bristol and London. Under the old system the journey had taken up to 38 hours. The stagecoach, funded by Palmer, left Bristol at 4&amp;nbsp;pm on 2 August 1784 and arrived in London just 16 hours later.&lt;ref&gt;The Postman and the Postal Service, Vera Southgate, Wills &amp; Hepworth Ltd, 1965, England&lt;/ref&gt;

Impressed by the trial run, Pitt authorised the creation of new routes. Within the month the service had been extended from London to [[Norwich]], [[Nottingham]], Liverpool and [[Manchester]], and by the end of 1785 services to the following major towns and cities of England and Wales had also been linked: [[Leeds]], [[Dover]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Poole]], [[Exeter]], [[Gloucester]], [[Worcester]], [[Holyhead]] and [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]. A service to [[Edinburgh]] was added the next year, and Palmer was rewarded by being made Surveyor and Comptroller General of the Post Office.&lt;ref name="PO" /&gt; By 1797 there were forty-two routes.&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stortfordhistory.co.uk/guide9/mailcoaches.html | title=Mail Coaches | publisher=Bishops Stortford Tourist Information | year=2004 | author=Paul Ailey | accessdate=21 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improved coach design===
The period from 1800 to 1830 saw great improvements in the design of coaches, notably by John Besant in 1792 and 1795. His coach had a greatly improved turning capacity and [[brake|braking system]], and a novel feature that prevented the wheels from falling off while the coach was in motion. Besant, with his partner John Vidler, enjoyed a monopoly on the supply of stagecoaches &lt;!--interpolated 'to the Royal Mail' in order to make sense of the statement--&gt; to the Royal Mail and a virtual monopoly on their upkeep and servicing for the following few decades.&lt;ref name="PO"/&gt;

Steel springs had been used in suspensions for vehicles since 1695.&lt;ref&gt;Frits van Sold, ''Obadiah Elliott &amp; the Elliptic Spring'', The Carriage Journal: Vol 53 No 2 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Coachbuilder Obadiah Elliott obtained a patent covering the use of elliptic springs - which were not his invention. His patent lasted 14 years delaying development because Elliott allowed no others to license and use his patent. Elliott mounted each wheel with two durable elliptic steel leaf springs on each side and the body of the carriage was fixed directly to the springs attached to the [[axle]]s. After the expiry of his patent most British horse carriages were equipped with elliptic springs; wooden springs in the case of light one-horse vehicles to avoid taxation, and steel springs in larger vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=William Bridges|authorlink=|title=English Pleasure Carriages|publisher=Charles Knight &amp; Co.|year=1837|location=London|pages=|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=apw7AAAAMAAJ| doi=|id=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improved roads===
[[Image:Rakeman – First American Macadam Road.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of a [[macadam]]ized road in the United States (1823). These roads allowed stagecoaches to travel at much greater speeds.]]
Steady improvements in road construction were also made at this time, most importantly the widespread implementation of [[Macadam]] roads up and down the country. The speed of coaches in this period rose from around 6 miles per hour (including stops for provisioning) to 8 miles per hour&lt;ref&gt;Gerhold: Stage Coaching and Turnpike Roads, Economic History Review, August 2014,, figure 1, p. 825&lt;/ref&gt; and greatly increased the level of mobility in the country, both for people and for [[mail]]. Each route had an average of four coaches operating on it at one time - two for both directions and a further two spares in case of a breakdown en route. Joseph Ballard described the stagecoach industry in 1815:
:"The stage fare from Manchester to Liverpool, distance forty miles, is only six shillings. This is caused by the strong opposition, as there are eight or ten coaches continually running between those places. Besides the fare in the coach you have to pay the coachman one shilling per stage of about thirty miles, and the same to the guard whose business it is to take care of the luggage, &amp;c. &amp;c. Should the passenger refuse to pay the accustomed tribute he would inevitably be insulted. You must pay also, at the inns, the chambermaid sixpence a night, the "boots" (the person who cleans them) two pence a day, and the head waiter one shilling a day. The porter who takes your portmanteau up stairs moves his hat with "pray remember the porter, Sir."
[[File:The hand-book of Wyoming and guide to the Black Hills and Big Horn regions (1877) (14780079804).jpg|thumb|Gentlemen ordered out of the coach to lighten the load on the horses. Three put their shoulders to the back.]]
:The beds at the inns are surprisingly neat and clean. In many of the inns in a large town, the chambermaids furnish the chambers and depend upon their fees for remuneration. The stagecoaches are very convenient and easy. No baggage is permitted to be taken inside, it being stowed away in the boot places before and behind the carriage for that purpose. Here it rides perfectly safe, not being liable to be rubbed, as they ride upon the same springs that the passengers do. A person can always calculate upon being at the place he takes the coach for (barring accidents) at a certain time, as the coachman is allowed a given time to go his stage. The guard always has a chronometer with him (locked up so that he cannot move the hands) as a guide with regard to time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rGkwMwEACAAJ|title=England in 1815 as Seen by a Young Boston Merchant|author=Joseph Ballard|year=1913|publisher=Boston &amp; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and evolution===
The [[History of rail transport in Great Britain 1830 - 1922|development of railways in the 1830s]] spelled the end for stagecoaches and [[mail coach]]es. The first rail delivery between Liverpool and Manchester took place on 11 November 1830. By the early 1840s most London-based coaches had been withdrawn from service.&lt;ref name="PO"/&gt;

Some stagecoaches remained in use for commercial or recreational purposes. They came to be known as road coaches and were used by their enterprising (or nostalgic) owners to provide scheduled passenger services where rail had not yet reached and also on certain routes at certain times of the year for the pleasure of an (often amateur) coachman and his daring passengers.

====Competitive display and sport====
[[File:Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec 024.jpg|thumb|left|Carriage driving, 1881. The owner's coachman watches&lt;br&gt;[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]]]
[[File:Brewster park drag 1887.jpg|thumb|Park drag built by [[Brewster &amp; Co.|Brewster]] in 1887]]
While stagecoaches vanished as rail penetrated the countryside the 1860s did see the start of a coaching revival spurred on by the popularity of [[Four-in-hand (carriage)|Four-in-hand]] driving as a sporting pursuit (the [[Four-In-Hand Driving Club]] was founded in 1856 and the Coaching Club in 1871).

New coaches often known as [[Park Drag]]s began to be built to order. Some owners would parade their vehicles and magnificently dressed passengers in fashionable locations. Other owners would take more enthusiastic suitably-dressed passengers and indulge in competitive driving. Very similar in design to stagecoaches their vehicles were lighter and sportier.

These owners were (often very expert) amateur gentlemen-coachmen, occasionally gentlewomen.&lt;ref group=note&gt;On Women
:More than one steed must Delia’s empire feel,
:Who sits triumphant o’er the flying wheel;
:And, as she guides it through th’ admiring throng,
:With what air she smacks the silken thong;
:Graceful as John she moderates the reins, 
:and whistles her sweet diuretic strains.
:Sesostris like, such charioteers as these
:May drive six harnessed monarchs, if they please.
:They drive, row, run, with love of glory smit;
:Leap, swim, shoot flying, and pronounce on wit.
::''[[Edward Young]]''&lt;/ref&gt; A professional coachman might accompany them to avert disaster. Professionals called these vehicles 'butterflies'. They only appeared in summer.&lt;ref&gt;Esdaile Malet, ''Annals of the Road: or, Notes on Mail and Stage Coaching in Great Britain'', London, Longmans Green 1876&lt;/ref&gt;

====Continental Europe====
[[File:Diligència Igualada-Barcelona.JPG|thumb|''Diligencia'' that was used between [[Igualada]] and [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]. A dedicated luggage deck is on the roof]]
The ''diligence'' (''[[wikt:dilly#Etymology 3|dilly]]'' for short), a solidly built coach with four or more horses, was the French analogue for public conveyance, especially in France, with minor varieties in Germany such as the ''Stellwagen'' and ''Eilwagen''. The ''diligence'' from Le Havre to Paris was described by a fastidious English visitor of 1803 with a thoroughness that distinguished it from its English contemporary, the ''stage coach''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;A more uncouth clumsy machine can scarcely be imagined. In the front is a cabriolet fixed to the body of the coach, for the accommodation of three passengers, who are protected from the rain above, by the projecting roof of the coach, and in front by two heavy curtains of leather, well oiled, and smelling somewhat offensively, fastened to the roof.  The inside, which is capacious, and lofty, and will hold six people in great comfort is lined with leather padded, and surrounded with little pockets, in which travellers deposit their bread, snuff, night caps, and pocket handkerchiefs, which generally enjoy each others&lt;!--others in original--&gt; company, in the same delicate depository. From the roof depends a large net work which is generally crouded&lt;!--crouded in original--&gt; with hats, swords, and band boxes, the whole is convenient, and when all parties are seated and arranged, the accommodations are by no means unpleasant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Upon the roof, on the outside, is the imperial, which is generally filled with six or seven persons more, and a heap of luggage, which latter also occupies the basket, and generally presents a pile, half as high again as the coach, which is secured by ropes and chains, tightened by a large iron windlass, which also constitutes another appendage of this moving mass. The body of the carriage rests upon large thongs of leather, fastened to heavy blocks of wood, instead of springs, and the whole is drawn by seven horses.&lt;ref&gt;One of the horses was ridden by the postilion. John Carr, ''The Stranger in France, or, A tour from Devonshire to Paris'' London 1803:32.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The English visitor noted the small, sturdy Norman horses "running away with our cumbrous machine, at the rate of six or seven miles an hour." At this speed  stagecoaches could compete with [[Narrowboat|canal boats]], but they were rendered obsolete in [[Europe]] wherever the [[railroad|rail]] network expanded in the 19th century. Where the rail network did not reach, the ''diligence'' was not fully superseded until the arrival of the [[autobus]].

In France, between 1765 and 1780, the ''turgotines'', big mail coaches named for their originator, Louis XVI's economist minister [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot|Turgot]], and improved roads, where a coach could travel at full gallop across levels, combined with more staging posts at shorter intervals, cut the time required to travel across the country sometimes by half.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fernand Braudel|Braudel, Fernand]], ''The Perspective of the World,'' vol. III of ''Civilization and Capitalism'' 1979 (in English 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Concord stagecoach 1869.png|thumb|right|[[Buffalo Soldier|Buffalo soldiers]] guard a Concord stagecoach, 1869]]
Beginning in the 18th century crude wagons began to be used to carry passengers between cities and towns, first within [[New England]] by 1744, then between [[New York City|New York]] and [[Philadelphia]] by 1756. Travel time was reduced on this later run from three days to two in 1766 with an improved coach called the ''Flying Machine''. The first mail coaches appeared in the later 18th century carrying passengers and the mails, replacing the earlier post riders on the main roads. Coachmen carried letters, packages, and money, often transacting business or delivering messages for their customers. By 1829 [[Boston]] was the hub of 77 stagecoach lines; by 1832 there were 106. Coaches with iron or steel springs were uncomfortable and had short useful lives. [[Abbot-Downing Company|Two men]] in  [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], [[New Hampshire]] developed what became a popular solution. They built their first [[Concord stagecoach]] in 1827 employing long leather straps under their stagecoaches which gave a swinging motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stagecoach West|last=Moody|first=Ralph|publisher=Bison Books-University of Nebraska Press|year=1998|isbn=0-8032-8245-1|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Kinnear Express stage 1880.jpg|thumb|right|Kinnear Concord stagecoach in 1880 [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] to [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]] route]]
In his 1861 book ''[[Roughing It]]'', [[Mark Twain]] described the Concord stage's ride as like "a cradle on wheels". Around twenty years later in 1880 John Pleasant Gray recorded after travelling from [[Tucson]] to [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] on J.D. Kinnear's mail and express line: ''“That day’s stage ride will always live in my memory — but not for its beauty spots. Jammed like sardines on the hard seats of an old time leather spring coach — a Concord — leaving [[Pantano, Arizona|Pantano]], creeping much of the way, letting the horses walk, through miles of alkali dust that the wheels rolled up in thick clouds of which we received the full benefit . . . It is always a mystery to the passenger how many can be wedged into and on top of a stagecoach. If it had not been for the long stretches when the horses had to walk, enabling most of us to get out and ‘foot it’ as a relaxation, it seems as if we could never have survived the trip.”'' The horses were changed three times on the {{convert|80|mi}} trip normally completed in 17 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Richard D. Moore. ''Too Tough to Tame, p. 72'' AuthorHouse, Bloomington 2009 {{ISBN|9781438961903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reforming the output is approximately 80% [[fuel gas]] and 20% [[Coke (fuel)|cokes]].

In staged reforming technology, gas conversion is a separate stage after [[pyrolysis]].

==First stage==
Organic material is decomposed into gas and coal at approximately 600°C.

==Second stage==
Gas produced by the first stage is reformed with water vapor and heat energy from the [[Coke (fuel)|cokes]] into a dust and residue-free [[fuel gas]]. 

Second stage process steps:

* Heating in the pre-heater at 1050°C. 
* Cooldown in the reformer by chemical reaction at 750°C
* Further cooling to 550°C by heating the cold cokes by using cold mix
* Re-heating to 1050°C

A '''standpipe''' is a freestanding pipe fitted with a [[tap (valve)|tap]] which is installed outdoors to dispense [[water]] in areas which do not have a running water supply to the buildings.

==Use==
In the [[United Kingdom]], an "Emergency Drought Order" permits a water company to shut off the primary water supply to homes, and to supply water instead from tanks or standpipes in the streets. This was done in some areas during the [[1976 United Kingdom heat wave|1976 heat wave]], for example.

In some [[Middle East]]ern, [[Caribbean]] and [[North Africa]]n countries a standpipe is used as a communal [[water supply]] for neighbourhoods which lack individual housing [[water service]]. In areas such as Morocco, standpipes often yield unreliable service and lead to [[water scarcity]] for large numbers of people.&lt;ref name="Benoit"&gt;Guillaume Benoit and Aline Comeau, ''A Sustainable Future for the Mediterranean'' (2005) 640 pages&lt;/ref&gt; This outcome is not based upon the unreliability of the hardware, but on the underlying condition of the [[Human overpopulation|population exceeding]] the [[carrying capacity]] of the region with respect to [[water resources]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11085">{{Fats}}
An '''unsaturated fat''' is a [[fat]] or [[fatty acid]] in which there is at least one [[double bond]] within the fatty acid chain.  A fatty acid chain is [[Monounsaturated fat|monounsaturated]] if it contains one double bond, and [[polyunsaturated fat|polyunsaturated]] if it contains more than one double bond.

Where double bonds are formed, [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s are subtracted from the carbon chain. Thus, a [[saturated fat]] has no double bonds, has the maximum number of hydrogens bonded to the carbons, and therefore is "saturated" with hydrogen atoms. In cellular [[metabolism]], unsaturated fat molecules contain somewhat less energy (i.e., fewer [[calories]]) than an equivalent amount of saturated fat. The greater the degree of unsaturation in a fatty acid (i.e., the more double bonds in the fatty acid) the more vulnerable it is to [[lipid peroxidation]] ([[rancidification|rancidity]]). [[Antioxidant]]s can protect unsaturated fat from lipid peroxidation.

== Chemistry and nutrition ==
[[File:Fatchart.svg|thumb|right|Amounts of fat types in selected foods]]

[[Double bond]]s may be in either a [[cis–trans isomerism|''cis'' or a ''trans'' isomer]], depending on the [[molecular geometry|geometry]] of the double bond. In the ''cis'' isomer, [[hydrogen]] atoms are on the same side of the double bond; whereas in the ''trans'' isomer, they are on opposite sides of the double bond (see [[trans fat]]). [[Saturated fat]]s are useful in [[food preservation|processed foods]] because saturated fats are less vulnerable to rancidity and usually more solid at room [[temperature]] than unsaturated fats. Unsaturated chains have a lower melting point, hence these molecules increase the fluidity of [[cell (biology)|cell]] [[cell membrane|membranes]].

Although both monounsaturated and [[polyunsaturated fat]]s can replace saturated fat in the diet, trans unsaturated fats should not. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats helps lower levels of total [[cholesterol]] and [[low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] cholesterol in the [[blood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reiner Željko|title=ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: the Task Force for the management of dyslipidaemias of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) |journal=European Heart Journal |date=28 June 2011 |volume=32 |issue=14 |pages=1769–818 |pmid=21723445 |doi=10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.06.012 |url=http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/14/1769.long |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trans unsaturated fats are an exception because the double bond [[stereochemistry]] predisposes the carbon chains to assume a linear [[Conformational isomerism|conformation]], which conforms to rigid packing as in [[atheroma|plaque]] formation. The geometry of the cis double bond induces a bend in the [[molecule]], thereby precluding rigid formations (see {{section link|Trans fat|Chemistry}} links above for drawings that illustrate this). Natural sources of [[fatty acid]]s (see above) are rich in the cis isomer{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}.

Although polyunsaturated fats are protective against [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s, a study of post-[[menopause]]al women with a relatively low fat intake showed that polyunsaturated fat is positively associated with progression of [[coronary]] [[atherosclerosis]], whereas [[monounsaturated fat]] is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dariush Mozaffarian |last2=Rimm |first2=EB |last3=Herrington |first3=DM  |title=Dietary fats, carbohydrate, and progression of coronary atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |date=1 November 2004 |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=1175–84 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/80/5/1175 |pmid=15531663 |pmc=1270002 |doi=10.1093/ajcn/80.5.1175}}&lt;/ref&gt; This probably is an indication of the greater vulnerability of polyunsaturated fats to [[lipid peroxidation]], against which [[vitamin E|vitamin&amp;nbsp;E]] has been shown to be protective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Hu |first2=ML |last3=Tappel |first3=AL |author=B Leibovitz |title=Dietary supplements of vitamin E, beta-carotene, coenzyme Q10 and selenium protect tissues against lipid peroxidation in rat tissue slices |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |year=1990 |volume=120 |issue=1 |pages=97–104 |pmid=2303916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of unsaturated fatty acids are [[palmitoleic acid]], [[oleic acid]], [[myristoleic acid]], [[linoleic acid]], and [[arachidonic acid]]. Foods containing unsaturated fats include [[avocado]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[olive oil]]s, and [[vegetable oil]]s such as [[canola]]. [[Meat]] products contain both saturated and unsaturated fats.

BBC Health, retrieved 2013-04-07&lt;/ref&gt; the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) recommendation stated that the amount of unsaturated fat consumed should not exceed 30% of one's daily caloric intake.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}  Most foods contain both unsaturated and saturated fats. Marketers advertise only one or the other, depending on which one makes up the majority. Thus, various unsaturated fat vegetable oils, such as olive oils, also contain saturated fat.&lt;ref name="pmid8781757"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Baur |first2=LA |last3=Kriketos |first3=AD |last4=Pan |first4=DA |last5=Cooney |first5=GJ |last6=Jenkins |first6=AB |last7=Calvert |first7=GD |last8=Campbell |first8=LV |author=LH Storlien |title=Dietary fats and insulin action |journal=Diabetologia |year=1996 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=621–31 |pmid=8781757 |doi=10.1007/BF00418533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of dietary fats in insulin resistance ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
Incidence of [[insulin resistance]] is lowered with diets higher in monounsaturated fats (especially oleic acid), while the opposite is true for diets high in polyunsaturated fats (especially large amounts of [[arachidonic acid]]) as well as saturated fats (such as [[arachidic acid]]).  These ratios can be indexed in the [[phospholipid]]s of human [[skeletal muscle]] and in other tissues as well.  This relationship between dietary fats and insulin resistance is presumed secondary to the relationship between insulin resistance and [[inflammation]], which is partially modulated by dietary fat ratios ([[Omega-3 fatty acids|Omega-3]]/[[Omega-6 fatty acids|6]]/[[Omega-9 fatty acids|9]]) with both omega 3 and 9 thought to be anti-inflammatory, and omega 6 pro-inflammatory (as well as by numerous other dietary components, particularly [[Health effects of polyphenols|polyphenols]] and exercise, with both of these anti-inflammatory).  Although both pro- and anti-inflammatory types of fat are [[biology|biologically]] necessary, fat dietary ratios in most US diets are skewed towards Omega 6, with subsequent disinhibition of inflammation and potentiation of insulin resistance.&lt;ref name="pmid8781757" /&gt; But this is contrary to the suggestion of [[Monounsaturated fat#Relation to health|more recent studies]], in which polyunsaturated fats are shown as protective against insulin resistance.

== Membrane composition as a metabolic pacemaker ==
Studies on the [[cell membrane]]s of [[mammal]]s and  [[reptile]]s discovered that mammalian cell membranes are composed of a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids ([[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]], [[omega-3 fatty acid]]) than [[reptile]]s.&lt;ref name="HulbertElse1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hulbert A.J., Else P.L. | year = 1999 | title = Membranes as Possible Pacemakers of Metabolism | url = | journal = J. Theor. Biol. | volume = 199 | issue = | pages = 257–274 | doi=10.1006/jtbi.1999.0955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on bird fatty acid composition have noted similar proportions to mammals but with 1/3rd less omega-3 fatty acids as compared to [[omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] for a given body size.&lt;ref name="Hulbertetal2002"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hulbert A.J., Faulks S., Buttemer W.A., Else P.L. | year = 2002 | title = Acyl Composition of Muscle Membranes Varies with Body Size in Birds | url = | journal = J. Exp. Biol. | volume = 205 | issue = | pages = 3561–3569 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fatty acid composition results in a more fluid cell membrane but also one that is permeable to various ions (H+ &amp; Na+), resulting in cell membranes that are more costly to maintain. This maintenance cost has been argued to be one of the key causes for the high metabolic rates and concomitant [[warm-blooded]]ness of mammals and birds.&lt;ref name="HulbertElse1999" /&gt; However polyunsaturation of cell membranes may also occur in response to chronic cold temperatures as well. In [[fish]] increasingly cold environments lead to increasingly high cell membrane content of both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, to maintain greater membrane fluidity (and functionality) at the lower [[temperature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=AJ Hulbert |title=Life, death and membrane bilayers |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |year=2003 |volume=206 |issue=Pt 14 |pages=2303–11 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/206/14/2303 |pmid=12796449 |doi=10.1242/jeb.00399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RaynardCossins1991"&gt;Raynard, R.S., Cossins, A.R. 1991.

'''Uranium pentafluoride''' is the [[inorganic compound]] with the chemical formula UF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a pale yellow paramagnetic solid.  The compound has attracted interest because it is related to [[uranium hexafluoride]], which is widely used to produce uranium fuel. It crystallizes in two [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]], called α- and β-UF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Synthesis and structure==
It can be produced by reduction of the hexafluoride with [[carbon monoxide]] at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon W. Halstead, P. Gary Eller "Uranium(V) Fluorides and Alkoxides" Inorganic Syntheses 1982, volume 21, 162. {{DOI|10.1002/9780470132524.ch35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
: 2 UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  CO   →  2  UF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  +  COF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Other reducing agents have been examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Inorganica Chimica Acta | year = 1979 | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–133 | title = Crystal structures of α-UF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; and spectral characterization of U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; | author = Eller, P. G. | author2 = Larson, A. C. | author3 = Peterson, J. R. | author4 = Ensor, D. D. | author5 = Young, J. P. | doi = 10.1016/S0020-1693(00)95530-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The α form is a linear [[coordination polymer]] consisting of chains of octahedral uranium centers in which one of the five fluoride anion forms a [[bridging ligand|bridge]] to the next uranium atom.&lt;ref name="howard1982"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Journal of Solid State Chemistry]] | year = 1982 | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 396–398 | title = Crystallographic parameters in α-UF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; by multiphase refinement of high-resolution neutron powder data | author = Howard, C. J. | author2 = Taylor, J. C. | author3 = Waugh, A. B. | doi = 10.1016/0022-4596(82)90185-2|bibcode = 1982JSSCh..45..396H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure is reminiscent of that for [[vanadium pentafluoride]].

In β form, the uranium centers adopt a [[square antiprism]]atic [[crystal structure|structure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Journal of Solid State Chemistry]] | year = 1980 | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–147 | title = Neutron diffraction study of β-uranium pentafluoride between 77 and 403 K | author = Taylor, J. C. | author2 = Waugh, A. B. | doi = 10.1016/0022-4596(80)90485-5 |bibcode = 1980JSSCh..35..137T }}&lt;/ref&gt; The β polymorph gradually converts to α at 130&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="howard1982"/&gt;&lt;!-- "An α-UF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; mixture was prepared by heating a β-UF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; sample from a previous study (5) at 180°C until there was no further change (in 24 hr) in the diffraction pattern." --&gt;
&lt;!-- howard1982 cites eller1979 and confirms Eller's Xray to a slightly higher resolution using neutron. howard gives some parameters but Eller might have more structure data to make a nice diagram --&gt;

==Monomeric UF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;==
Of theoretical interest, molecular UF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; can be generated as a transient [[monomer]] by UV-[[photolysis]] of [[uranium hexafluoride]]. It is thought to adopt a [[square pyramidal]] geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Structure and Bond Nature of the UF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; Monomer |author= Onoe, J. |author2= Nakamatsu, H. |author3= Mukoyama, T. |author4= Sekine, R. |author5= Adachi, H. |author6= Takeuchi, K. |journal= Inorg.
