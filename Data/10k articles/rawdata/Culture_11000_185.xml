'''613 Torah Avenue''' is a popular series of [[Jewish]] children's [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] and [[video]] [[albums]].  The first title appeared in 1977.

The series was created by Cheryle Knobel and Rivkah Neuman, of [[Brooklyn]]. Rivkah Neuman is the renowned Pre-1A teacher in Yeshiva Toras Emes Kamenitz in Brooklyn for many years. The instrumentation and arrangements in the series are a good example of religious Jewish music of the early 1960s and 1970s.

"613 Torah Avenue" is the fictional address of its main character, a young Jewish boy named Chaim. The number 613 is significant in [[Judaism]] as the traditional number of [[mitzvot]] in the [[Torah]].

== Synopsis ==
Each album or video consists of a series of sketches grouped around a general plot line (Chaim walking down the street, at a carnival, his day at school, etc.), alternating with songs. In these sketches, Chaim talks and otherwise interacts with other characters, both human and inanimate (which are [[anthropomorphized]]), and their conversation eventually leads into the topic of the following song.

In common with much other children's literature, the dialogue is arranged in rhyming form, making it easier for children to follow (and often to memorize).

In the first five titles in the series, the songs are arranged according to the order of the [[parsha|weekly Torah portions]]; generally there is one song per parsha, although sometimes there are two. The subsequent titles are on [[Pirkei Avot]], [[Jewish prayer|tefillah]], and the [[seasons]] of the year with their [[Jewish holidays]].

The [[melodies]] of the songs are taken from a wide variety of sources, both Jewish and non-Jewish: [[folk songs]], popular songs, and so forth.

== Titles ==
Currently the series consists of the following audio titles:

* Vol. I, Songs for [[Humash|Chumash]] [[Book of Genesis|Bereishis]]
* Vol. II, Songs for Chumash [[Book of Exodus|Shemos]]
* Vol. III, Songs for Chumash [[Leviticus|Vayikra]]
* Vol. IV, Songs for Chumash [[Book of Numbers|Bamidbar]]
* Vol. V, Songs for Chumash [[Deuteronomy|Devarim]]
* Vol. VI, Songs for [[Pirkei Avos]]
* Vol. VII, Songs for [[Tefilah]]
* Vol. VIII, Songs for the [[Seasons]] and [[Jewish holidays|Yomim Tovim]]

and the following video titles:

* Vol. I, Songs for Chumash Bereishis ([[animation|animated]])
* Vol. II, Songs for Chumash Shemos (animated)
* Vol. IV, Songs for Chumash Bamidbar (mixed [[live-action]] and animation)
* Vol. VI, Songs for Pirkei Avos (mixed live-action and animation)
* Vol. VII, Songs for Tefilah (mixed live-action and animation)
* Vol. VIII, Songs for the Seasons and Yomim Tovim (live-action)

== Theme song ==
Each title begins (and usually ends) with a variation of the series theme song, "It's Time to Learn Torah." The original, from Vol. I, is:

:''It's time to learn Torah right now''
:''Follow me, I'll show you how''
:''If every one of us tries''
:''We will grow up great and wise''

:''Every Sedrah has a song and rhyme''
:''That you can learn in a short time''
:''The Torah is our guide''
:''By its Mitzvos we abide''

'''Academic program prioritization''' is the activity or process in which an [[academic institution]] assesses and prioritizes its programs for the purpose of more strategically allocating its funding and resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d.umn.edu/vcaa/program_prioritization.html Program prioritization homepage at the University of Minnesota Duluth]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a process a school engages in when it intends to make systematic changes. For instance, [[Boise State University]] underwent a yearlong process of exploring and assessing its programs with the intention of making the university more focused and more aligned with the needs of its students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.boisestate.edu/prioritization/ Program prioritization homepage at Boise State University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Program prioritization is similar to [[program evaluation]] but differs in that it not only involves evaluating programs but also involves making financial decisions concerning program funding. Program prioritization can be a significant issue, having the potential to affect the lives and goals of both students and faculty.  This page deals with program prioritization in the context of [[higher education]], and it attempts to provide a basic description of what this entails.

==General description==

A school engaged in the process of prioritizing its programs may decide to either increase, decrease, continue, or discontinue the funding for particular programs, leading to these programs being either expanded, downsized, unchanged, or discontinued entirely. For example, in 2013, [[Western Carolina University]] announced that after a process of program prioritization it would discontinue several programs including a bachelor’s in [[Germans studies|German]], a minor in [[women’s studies]], as well master’s programs in [[music]], [[health sciences]], [[English studies|English]], and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;"Belcher announces program cuts, 3 programs saved", News page, Western Carolinian University [http://www.westerncarolinian.com/news/belcher-announces-program-cuts-3-programs-saved-1.3048901#.Uw49fPldUuc]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Programs are generally prioritized on the basis of their student populations and potential to attract new students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indstate.edu/academicaffairs/program_prioritization.htm Program prioritization homepage, Indiana State University]&lt;/ref&gt; Though, other factors may also weigh in on the likelihood of a program being downsized or discontinued, such as its overall cost for the university.

==Causes==

Prioritization of programs and reallocation of funding are usually necessitated by the combination of two factors: 1) A school’s desire to develop and expand, and 2) limited funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/11/11/priorities "The Pressure to Prioritize", Inside Higher Ed]&lt;/ref&gt; If a school wants to grow and expand its programs, but doesn’t possess the resources to develop each program equally, prioritization may become necessary. Schools are under pressure to expand and therefore they are going to be under pressure to reallocate funding towards more successful programs.&lt;ref&gt;Dickeson, Robert C., 2010,"Prioritizing Academic Programs and Services: Reallocating Resources to Achieve Strategic Balance" [https://www.amazon.com/Prioritizing-Academic-Programs-Services-Reallocating/dp/0470559683]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Aoi no Ue'''|葵の上}} is a [[fictional character]] in ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (''Genji Monogatari''). Daughter of the Minister of the Left (Tō no Chūjō's sister) and Genji’s first principal wife, she marries Genji when she is sixteen and he only twelve. Proud and distant from her husband, Aoi is constantly aware of the age difference between them and very much hurt by Genji's philandering. For a short while, after giving birth to Genji's son, Yūgiri, and suffering episodes of spirit possession, does Aoi actually appear appealing in Genji's eyes. The episode of spirit possession itself (''[[Mononoke|mono no ke]]'') is extremely controversial and brings forward two female characters of the tale: Aoi (Genji's wife) and [[Lady Rokujō]] (Genji's mistress). The relationship between the two women may be that between victim and aggressor, if one follows the traditional interpretation of spirit possession,&lt;ref&gt;Royall Tyler tends to interpret spirit possession at face value, at least in the case of another female character, Ukifune. Tyler, Royall and Susan. "The Possession of Ukifune". Asiatica Venetiana, 5 (2002): 177–209.&lt;/ref&gt; or that between accomplices expressing their discontent with the Heian system of polygynous marriage (and with Genji, obviously).&lt;ref&gt;Doris Bargen, ''A Woman's Weapon: Spirit Possession in The Tale of Genji'', Honolulu: University of Hawai’i Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Aoi dies at the end of the "Aoi" chapter and her exit from the tale is thus definitive.

''Aoi no Ue'' is also the title of [[Aoi no Ue (play)|a Noh play]] about her, translated as ''Lady of the Court'', or in the modern version by [[Yukio Mishima]], ''The Lady Aoi''.

==In popular culture==
Pioneering electronic music composers [[Joji Yuasa]] and [[Toshiro Mayuzumi]] both composed a piece entitled ''Aoi no Ue''.

Aoi Ue also appears as a character in the famous [[Salman Rushdie]] novel, ''[[The Moor's Last Sigh]]''.

'''The Architects Act 1997''' (c. 22) is the consolidating [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] for the keeping and publishing of the statutory [[Register of Architects]] by the [[Architects Registration Board]]. It has the [[long title]]: ''An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to architects.'' It consolidated two Acts of the 1930s as later amended both by primary legislation and by Orders in Council implementing the EC directive on architects providing for the recognition of architects qualified in other EC states, and the changes which had been made by Part III&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/53/part/III/1996-10-01?timeline=true E+W+S+N.I. Architects]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970120/text/70120-03.htm#70120-03_head0 Hansard]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passage of the consolidating Bill==
The Architects Act 1997 consolidated the originating and amending Acts relating to the registration of architects, namely the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects Acts]] 1931-1996 (section 125 of the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]]).

The [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] was introduced to the [[House of Lords]] on 17 December 1996 by the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern|Lord Mackay of Clashfern]], and given its first reading.&lt;ref name="introduced"/&gt; It received its second reading without call for a debate on 20 January 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970120/text/70120-03.htm#70120-03_head0|title=House of Lords Hansard; vol 577, part 39, col 384|date=20 January 1997|work=[[Hansard]]|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was passed to the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills. On 3 March 1997 it was read for a third time without debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970303/text/70303-03.htm#70303-03_head3|title=House of Lords Hansard; vol 578, part 66, Col 1503|date=3 March 1997|work=[[Hansard]]|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&amp;STEMMER=en&amp;WORDS=17%20mar%201997%20column%20696&amp;ALL=&amp;ANY=&amp;PHRASE=%2217%20Mar%201997%20:%20Column%20696%20%22&amp;CATEGORIES=&amp;SIMPLE=&amp;SPEAKER=&amp;COLOUR=red&amp;STYLE=s&amp;ANCHOR=70317-26_spnew0&amp;URL=/pa/cm199697/cmhansrd/vo970317/debtext/70317-26.htm#70317-26_spnew0|title=House of Commons Hansard; 17 March 1997 part 26, Col 695|date=17 March 1997|work=[[Hansard]]|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill was given [[Royal Assent]] on 19 March 1997 and came into force on 21 July 1997.

==Legislative continuity==
The legislative continuity from the originating Act of 1931 to the consolidating Act of 1997 is shown by paragraph 19(2)(a) of Schedule 2 in the 1997 Act:
: ''"the Council" means the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom established under the 1931 Act, which was renamed as the Board by section 118(1) of the 1996 Act.''
The [[Architects Registration Board]] (ARB) has limited powers to make rules in the manner prescribed by the Architects Act 1997, but not the power to make regulations which had previously been ascribed to the registration body when it was constituted as the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK).

==Statutory purpose==
The Act embodied previous legislation consequent upon [[Directive (European Union)|EU directives]] concerning the mutual recognition of professional qualifications in the [[member states of the European Union]] and other [[European Economic Area|EEA]] States, and certain changes which had been made to the previous legislation after the publication of the [[Warne Report]] in 1993.

For the purpose of ascertaining the duties and functions which the Architects Registration Board is required to execute and perform under the Architects Act 1997, the constraints on the Board include the requirements judicially applicable in the name of [[administrative law]].

In May 2006 ministerial responsibility for the ARB was transferred from the ODPM to the DCLG ([[Department for Communities and Local Government]]).  The DCLG website shows that of "four categories" of "[[non-departmental public bodies]]" (NDPBs) the ARB was being classified (at the end of May 2007) as one of two "[[Statutory corporation|public corporations]]", the other one being the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;not to be confused with the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)]]&lt;/ref&gt; a body of entirely different political and legislative origin, function and capacities, so that the two have practically nothing in common. The website there briefly described the ARB as:
: ''The independent statutory regulator of all UK registered architects which has a dual mandate to protect the consumer and to safeguard the reputation of architects''.
That appears to have been more a politically advised than a factual statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/22|title=Architects Act|year=1997|work=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071116155827/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1997/1997022.htm| archivedate=November 16, 2007&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it lacks congruity with an ordinary or accurate reading of the legislation enacted by Parliament (see further information below "Accuracy of Government Information").

===Amendment in 2008 under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)]]===
[[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|Amendments]] made in June 2008 by [[Statutory Instrument]] established rules for the recognition of professional qualifications enabling migrants from the [[European Economic Area]] or [[Switzerland]] to register as architects in the United Kingdom. It also set out provisions for facilitating temporary and occasional professional services cross-border.

==Changes: before and after July 1997==
The previous legislation had enabled and required the [[Register of Architects]] to be established, maintained and published; and for that purpose there had been a Council, called the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK), which had been established as a body corporate by the originating Act, namely the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]].

The changes embodied in the [[consolidating Act]] of 1997 had first been enacted in Part III of the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]].  The changes had been made on the basis of a government consultation document dated 19 July 1994 which the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]] had issued with the title "[[Reform of Architects Registration]]".  The consultation document had set out fourteen proposals for reform, stemming from a request from ARCUK to the Government in 1992 that the Architects Registration Acts should be reviewed; and stated that a report on the review which had been carried out had been published by HMSO in 1993.  The report had been made by Mr E J D Warne, CB, and is commonly known as "The [[Warne Report]]".

The legislation which followed carried the proposed purposes into effect only in part.  In the consultation document the purpose of the reformed body was stated to be: setting criteria for admission to the Register; preventing misuse of the title "[[architect]]"; and the discipline of unprofessional conduct, and the setting of fee levels.  To that end, fourteen proposals had been enumerated.  Some were later abandoned; and others substantially altered, whether in the Bill which was presented to Parliament or in its passage through Parliament, including:
* that the reformed Board would be given statutory authority to make regulations consistent with the provisions of the legislation governing architects registration;
* that the reformed Board would publicise a statement of the criteria for disciplinary offences; and
* that in disciplinary cases, there would be a range of non-monetary penalties, and hearings would be before a small statutory committee composed of both architects and non-architects, with a right to appeal to the full Board.

Proposals mentioned in the consultation document which were later enacted and are now operative were:
* that ARCUK would remain as a legal entity, but, with no impact on its role or status, the name would be changed to "[[Architects Registration Board]]" (ARB);
* that there should be an office of Registrar whose functions would be to maintain the Register and carry out the instructions of the Board;
* that the Board would be made up of 8 lay members appointed by the Government, and 7 architects elected by registered architects; and
* that the [[Board of Architectural Education]] would be abolished, by reason of it being an unwieldy body which would be unnecessary for fulfilling the functions of the reformed Registration Board.

The Table of Derivations, set out at the end of the Act after Schedule 3, by showing the changes which had been made by the 1996 Act to the originating Act of 1931 (as it had by then been amended by the 1938 Act and other legislation), distinguishes them from the provisions which were in the legislation before the 1996 Act, and so were operative in the time of ARCUK and have remained operative from 21 July 1997, when the reconstituting changes took effect.

===Professional Conduct Committee===
One of the changes made was replacing the Discipline Committee of ARCUK with a Professional Conduct Committee under Part III of the Act with statutory powers to inflict fines expressly on a par with criminal penalties. Under the Act, the committee was to be a body having persons who were not themselves members of the profession in the decisive majority and who would not necessarily have the appropriate skill and knowledge to be able to act competently and fairly in respect of hazarding an architect's professional reputation or livelihood; nor would members of the committee be acting under the judicial oath of a judge or a magistrate in a court of criminal or civil jurisdiction, or pursuant to the consensual jurisdiction of an arbitrator. As a safeguard of [[due process]] in accordance with the [[rule of law]] the statutory provisions for constituting the Professional Conduct Committee in Part II of Schedule 1 of the Act (and as later amended) reflect the usual practice for appointing a legally qualified chairman, with appropriate experience, who can be held to have a professional and judicial responsibility for protecting the basic right of any accused person, whose reputation and livelihood could be at stake, to a fair and unprejudiced hearing and trial.

'''Exoneration'''

Under the first section of Part III of the Act &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/22/part/III section 13]&lt;/ref&gt; 
the Board is required to issue a code "laying down standards of professional conduct and practice expected of registered persons",&lt;ref&gt;for current code see ARB website page Architects Code: Standards of Conduct and Practice 2010 Version [http://www.arb.org.uk/professional_standards/regulating_architects/architects_code_2010/code.php]&lt;/ref&gt; but the same section  states explicitly that failure to comply with the provisions of the code shall not be taken of itself to constitute unacceptable professional conduct. In the case of an architect against whom an allegation of unacceptable professional conduct or serious professional incompetence has not been sustained by the Professional Conduct Committee the Act provides for publication of an exonerating statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/22/part/III section 15 (5)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The Table of Derivations also shows that certain definitions which were inserted for the purpose of the consolidation included one to make clear that where there is a reference to "unacceptable professional conduct", it has the same meaning as it has in section 14 (not ''vice versa''): in section 14(1) the phrase is expanded as "conduct which falls short of the standard required of a registered person".

==Interpretation==

===Legislative context of Architects Registration===
Under the legislation, the registration body has been a statutory corporation from its inception, first as a Council of numerous persons nominated mainly by professional bodies under the 1931 Act, and, from July 1997, as a Board of fifteen persons, of which the majority has been appointed by the [[Privy Council]] in the manner prescribed by paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 1 of the Act, that is: 
: ''...after consultation with the Secretary of State and such other persons or bodies as the Privy Council thinks fit, to represent the interests of users of architectural services and the general public'',
Members of the general public clearly have an interest to the extent that the legislation makes it a criminal offence to infringe the restrictions placed upon the freedom of individuals (including qualified architects), and of firms and partnerships, and companies and corporations of all kinds, to use the word "architect".

From the 1880s, it has been a moot point whether the effect of such registration and protection of the title "architect" would be to place an undue burden on the profession for too little benefit for the public, or to confer an unfair advantage on the profession, or one section of it, as against competitors. But in more recent decades the statutory [[Register of Architects]] and the protection of the title "[[architect]]" under the legislation has been affected by the obligation of the Government to secure compliance with obligations in connection with membership of the [[European Union]] and the [[European Economic Area]]. This has brought in its train questions about the criteria and standards for deciding upon [[equivalence of professional qualifications]] in EU and EEA countries, and the legitimate expectations of those who have qualified.

===Accuracy of UK Government information about Architects Registration===
In May 2006 the then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair|(Mr Blair)]] arranged for ministerial responsibility for the Architects Registration Board to be transferred from the then [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] (ODPM) to a newly formed Department which was to be called "[[Department of Communities and Local Government|Communities and Local Government]]" (DCLG) and to be headed by a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] ([[Ruth Kelly]]), to whom the Prime Minister addressed [http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/388681/prime-minister-letter a letter] setting out what was required.  This Department's [http://www.communities.gov.uk/ official website] published the Prime Minister's letter and stated its vision to be of "prosperous and cohesive communities, offering a safe, healthy and sustainable environment for all".

The website also had [http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/buildingregulations/architects/architectsregistration/ a page] for describing the [[Architects Registration Board]] where it offered a summary of the effect of the legislation, but which had a thread of inaccuracy in three out of four sentences, namely:
* stating that ARB "succeeded" ARCUK, when the legislation had expressly stated that it was the same body but with another name as from July 1997 (See above: Continuity of Legislation);
* stating that it was established to guarantee the professional competence of architects to consumers, when there is nothing in the legislation or otherwise giving ARB either the legal powers or the funds to honour any such guarantee; and
* that all architects must be registered by ARB in order to practise legally in the United Kingdom, when under the legislation (see related articles cited below) an architect, or any other person, is free to perform or supply the services of an architect subject only to the restrictions on the use of the vernacular word "[[architect]]" contained in the legislation first enacted by Parliament in the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|1938 Act]].

'''Isaac's artwork''', which appears on the show and its graphic novels, are shown to be accurate predictions of future events.

Noah Bennet explains to his wife that Isaac's paintings are never wrong. Isaac's paintings always, consistently, come true (though the actual futures experienced by time-travellers [[Hiro Nakamura]] and [[Peter Petrelli]] vary whenever they travel forward in time)- but the context of the situation is not always given. The painting of New York exploding came from Hiro's perspective, and the paintings of the exploding man standing in Kirby Plaza came from Peter's dreams. Isaac's paintings are a reliable source of information on events, but not context.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

      <comment>Black Ops III is the game that most falls under the cyberpunk genre in the Call of Duty franchise, using elements from Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Akira, and even less common elements used in Japanese cyberpunk including body horror, and explores way more of technology than BO2. If Black Ops II is categorized as cyberpunk, Black Ops III deserves even more so to fall under this category.</comment>

'''''Call of Duty: Black Ops III''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] video game, developed by [[Treyarch]] and published by [[Activision]]. It is the twelfth entry in the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' series and the sequel to the 2012 video game ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]]''. It was released on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on November 6, 2015. A feature-limited version developed by [[Beenox]] and [[Mercenary Technology]] that only supports multiplayer modes was released on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] and was also the final ''Call of Duty'' title released on those platforms.

''Black Ops III'' takes place in 2065, 40 years after the events of ''Black Ops II'', in a world facing upheaval from climate change and new technologies. Similar to its predecessors, the story follows a group of [[black ops]] soldiers. The game's campaign is designed to support 4-player [[cooperative gameplay]], allowing for bigger, more open level design and less corridor shooting. As the player character is cybernetically enhanced, players have access to various special activities. The game also features a standalone Zombies mode, and a "Nightmares" mode which replaces all enemies as zombies.

Announced on April 26, 2015, the game is the first ''Call of Duty'' video game released after Activision parted with [[Microsoft Studios]] and partnered with [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], which secured the timed exclusivity of the game's [[downloadable content]]. Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews from critics, albeit slightly lower than the previous two games in the sub-series, with critics praising the gameplay, Zombies mode, and content. However, it was criticized for its story, absence of fan favorite story mode characters, and its lack of innovation. The seventh-generation console versions in particular were criticized for the lack of a campaign and numerous features, as well as it being online-only. It was a commercial success, with it becoming the top-selling retail game in the US in 2015, and one of the most successful titles released for the [[eighth generation of video game consoles]]. A sequel, ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops 4]]'', was released in October 2018.

==Gameplay==

===Campaign===
The campaign in ''Black Ops III'' is designed to support 4-player [[cooperative gameplay]], allowing for bigger, more open level design and less corridor shooting. In addition, the player can customize their character's appearance and clothing. The campaign features its own progression system, featuring unlock tokens which must be used to acquire different weapons and gears as they progress through the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/26/black-ops-3-what-you-need-to-know-about-multiplayer-zombies-and-campaign|title=Black Ops 3: What You Need To Know About Multiplayer, Zombies And Campaign|first=Brian|last=Albert|work=[[IGN]]|date=July 9, 2015|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features a "realistic" difficulty mode, in which players will get defeated if they are hit by one bullet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/black-ops-3-getting-one-hit-kill-realistic-difficulty/?tag=grsocial-20|title=Black Ops 3's getting a one hit kill Realistic difficulty level.

===Multiplayer===
The multiplayer introduces a new momentum based movement system, which utilizes thruster packs to allow players to perform slow boosts into the air, as well as perform wall running and sliding, all the while giving players complete gun control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/04/26/call-of-duty-black-ops-3/|title='Call of Duty: Black Ops 3' is fast, frantic and adds a co-op campaign|first=Xav|last=De Matos|work=[[Engadget]]|date=April 26, 2015|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Pick 10 class system from ''Black Ops II'', Treyarch implemented a character system called "Specialists", where players can pick from 9 different soldiers, each with either a special weapon or ability unique to them.

===Zombies===
Zombies features a new [[experience (gaming)|XP]] progression system, which allows players to unlock items in a similar fashion to multiplayer and campaign. Unlockable items include "Gobblegums", which grant players with temporary bonuses, and weapon kits that allow players to modify the appearance of the guns in each game. ''Shadows of Evil'' was revealed as a new map for the Zombies mode on July 9, 2015 at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con International 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/25/8848757/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-zombies-reveal|title=Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 zombies mode to be revealed at San Diego Comic-Con|first=Michael|last=McWhertor |date=June 25, 2015|accessdate=July 9, 2015|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The map features four brand new characters: Nero the Magician, Jessica the Femme Fatale, Vincent the Cop and Campbell the Boxer as the main cast, and takes place in a new setting called Morg City.&lt;ref name="ignzombies"/&gt; "The Giant" includes the original characters, Tank Dempsey, Edward Richtofen, Nikolai Belinski and Takeo Masaki.

==Plot==

===Single-player campaign===
====Setting and characters====
''Call of Duty: Black Ops III'' takes place in 2065, 40 years after the events of ''Black Ops II'', in a world facing upheaval from conflicts, [[climate change]] and new technologies. A Third [[Cold war (general term)|Cold War]] is ongoing between two global alliances, known as Winslow Accord and Common Defense Pact. In response to the drone assaults caused by [[narco-terrorist]] Raul Menendez in 2025, several countries around the world have developed [[Directed-energy weapon|Directed Energy Air Defense]] systems that render conventional air forces virtually useless. As such, most of the warfare between countries is done by [[Covert operation|covert operatives]] fighting behind enemy lines. [[Military technology]] has progressed to the point where [[robotics]] play a major role in combat, and both fully robotic humanoid drones and cyborg [[supersoldier]]s have been developed to fight in the battlefield. There is speculation and fear about an eventual [[AI takeover|robotic takeover]].

Like previous installments in the ''Black Ops'' series, the campaign follows a team of [[Black operation|black ops]] soldiers&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kain|first1=Erik|title=Check Out The 'Call Of Duty: Black Ops 3' Ember Teaser|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2015/04/23/check-out-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-3-ember-teaser/|website=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes, Inc|date=April 23, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who work for Winslow Accord. The player character (voiced by [[Ben Browder]] if male and [[Abby Brammell]] if female) and Jacob Hendricks (Sean Douglas) are members of the faction's [[wetwork]] team, while Commander John Taylor ([[Christopher Meloni]]) and his team Sebastian Diaz (Reynaldo Gallegos), Sarah Hall ([[Katee Sackhoff]]), and Peter Maretti (Ary Katz), compose the faction's [[cybernetics]] division.&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dornbush|first=Jonathan|title=Exclusive: Katee Sackhoff, Christopher Meloni, more join Call of Duty: Black Ops III voice cast|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/02/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-voice-cast-christopher-meloni-katee-sackhoff?hootPostID=4387c90ec83c76c370c8247181358f5f|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty goes "Beast Mode"|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13005815/black-ops-iii|last=Alipour|first=Sam|date=June 9, 2015|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachel Kimsey]] voices [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Rachel Kane, [[Robert Picardo]] voices the Coalescence Corporation CEO Sebastian Krueger, [[Tony Amendola]] voices the therapist Dr. Yousef Salim, and [[Lynn Chen]] voices the 54 Immortals criminal organization leader, Goh Xiulan. [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Marshawn Lynch]] makes a cameo appearance in the game as a 54 Immortals mercenary.

Included in the game is the "Nightmares" campaign mode, which is a retelling of the main campaign with the plot changed to incorporate zombies and other supernatural beings. In this campaign, the lethal [[Virus]] 61-15 is released in various cities around the world, turning whoever it infects into zombies. In response, the governments of the world seal off the worst infected areas into [[Quarantine]] Zones and form the Deadkillers, cybernetic soldiers trained to exterminate zombies.

====Story====
On October 27, 2065, the Winslow Accord black ops initiate a successful mission in [[Ethiopia]] to rescue hostages from the tyrannical Nile River Coalition. However, the Player is critically wounded by a combat robot. Rescued by Taylor, the Player undergoes cybernetic surgery to save their life, being installed with a [[Brain–computer interface|direct neural interface]] (DNI) and receiving virtual training from Taylor and his team during surgery. Hendricks also undergoes surgery.

After five years of [[wetwork]], the Player and Hendricks are put under the command of Rachel Kane and tasked with investigating a CIA [[black site]] in [[Singapore]] that has gone quiet. They find the site attacked by the 54 Immortals and the site's data stolen. Kane concludes that Taylor and his team defected and murdered the staff. The Player and Hendricks then disguise themselves as arms dealers and meet up with the 54 Immortals. The mission goes awry when their cover is blown, causing the death of one of the 54i's leaders, Goh Min. They manage to recover data regarding Taylor's last known location, a facility of the Coalescence Corporation in Singapore (destroyed ten years prior in a mysterious explosion that killed 300,000 people).

The Player and Hendricks travel to the facility, and discover a hidden CIA research laboratory. The pair find Diaz leaking CIA information and are forced to kill him. Interfacing with Diaz's DNI, Hendricks discovers Taylor is trying to find the survivors of the explosion: Sebastian Krueger and Dr. Yousef Salim. The leaked information allows the Immortals to capture Kane. The Player disobeys Kane's orders to leave and rescues her by killing Immortals' other leader, Goh Min's sister Xiulan. The trio then head to [[Egypt]] and find Salim, who reveals that he performed secret DNI experiments involving comforting humans via a calming exercise involving imagining a frozen forest.

Salim is then interrogated and executed by Taylor. The Player, Hendricks and Kane pursue Taylor with assistance from the [[Egyptian Army]]. After killing Hall, the Player connects to her DNI and encounters Corvus, a [[Group mind (science fiction)|gestalt intelligence]] created during the experiments to monitor thoughts of DNI users which malfunctioned, causing the explosion. Infecting Taylor and his team, Corvus made them obsessed with finding the forest, with the Player and Hendricks also becoming infected after interfacing with Hall and Diaz.

After killing Maretti, the pair track down Taylor in [[Cairo]]. After wounding the Player, Taylor manages to resist Corvus and tear his DNI out, sparing the Player. However, Hendricks then succumbs to Corvus and kills Taylor before abandoning the Player, leaving for [[Zürich]] to find Krueger. The Player races to Zürich with Kane to stop him. Reaching Zürich's Coalescence Corporation, the pair find Corvus caused the explosion with the gas Nova 6. Kane attempts to contain it, but Corvus locks her in the compound room, leaking the gas to kill her in front of a helpless Player.

Continuing on, the Player finds Hendricks holding Krueger hostage. After Hendricks kills Krueger, the Player kills him in turn. The Player then tries to kill themselves to end Corvus' infection, but ends up in a simulated frozen forest, created by Corvus to retain the consciousness of dead DNI users. Taylor, still alive after becoming a glitch in the forest, reunites with the Player, stating that they must purge their DNI to end Corvus. With Taylor's help, the Player resists Corvus' last-ditch manipulation and purges their DNI, erasing the virus. Stumbling out of the Zurich headquarters, the Player identifies themselves to Zürich Security Forces as "Taylor".

Taylor's mission reports reveal that the Player actually died during their cybernetics surgery due to complications. The resulting events until Taylor's death occur in a simulation deviating from Taylor and Hendricks's experience of hunting down Dylan Stone and his team (Javier Ramirez, Alice Conrad, and Joseph Fierro), their teammates who defected after finding the CIA black site. The Player's consciousness is shown living in Taylor's mind throughout the simulation, indicating that the Player manages to take over Taylor's body after his simulated death until the DNI purge sees Corvus erased and Taylor regains control.

====Nightmares====
The Player wakes up only to be told by Dr. Salim that they are dead, and that the Player must recount their memories. The Player tells Dr. Salim that they are a Deadkiller who was sent to investigate the disappearance of Taylor's Deadkiller team. However, upon investigating, the Player and Hendricks discover that Taylor's team has used their DNI connections to disable the Quarantine Zone defenses all over the world. Teaming up with Rachel Kane, the Player and Hendricks chase Taylor's team all from Singapore to Egypt, eventually being forced to kill the entire team. However, Hendricks is infected by the same virus that turned Taylor and his team mad, and heads for Zurich. The Player discovers that Dr. Salim is in fact Deimos, the demigod responsible for unleashing the undead plague on humanity. Deimos had entered the Player's mind when they interfaced with Hall, and attempts to manipulate them into opening a portal to his home dimension, Malus. The Player is then contacted by another demigod, Dolos, who is sympathetic to humanity and seeks to kill Deimos, her brother. Dolos transports both the Player and Deimos to Malus, where Deimos is vulnerable. Under Dolos' guidance, the Player kills Deimos, ending the undead plague on Earth, but trapping the Player in Malus. Dolos then explains to the Player that her true plans are to kill every other demigod and supernatural being that can challenge her, and the Player agrees to help her.

===Multiplayer===
The Multiplayer mode of ''Black Ops III'' features a shared narrative setting with the campaign, in which players battle in virtual simulations across a variety of battlefields, while wielding the avatars of nine elite soldiers, referred to collectively as "Specialists": infantry grunt Donnie "Ruin" Walsh; scoutswoman Alessandra "Outrider" Castillo; engineer David "Prophet" Wilkes; demolitions expert Erin "Battery" Baker; 54 Immortals enforcer He "Seraph" Zhen-Zhen; survivalist Tavo "Nomad" Rojas; specialized combat robot "Reaper"; assassin "Spectre"; and arsonist Krystof "Firebreak" Hejek.

Through progression of each Specialist, players can unlock audio logs that provide backstories of each of the soldier. Full progression of all Specialists unlocks a final audio log, in which an unknown informant reports to his superior about keeping tabs on "eight other soldiers", implying that one of the Specialists, heavily hinted to be Prophet, is not a simulated avatar, but the real person injecting themselves into the simulation to monitor the other eight.

===Zombies===
====Settings and characters====
Like in previous games, the Zombies storyline in ''Call of Duty: Black Ops III'' is told in an episodic format, with one map, "Shadows of Evil", available at launch, and the rest to follow in the [[downloadable content]] season. "Shadows of Evil" focuses on a new group of characters: Nero Blackstone ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), Jessica Rose ([[Heather Graham]]), Jack Vincent ([[Neal McDonough]]) and Floyd Campbell ([[Ron Perlman]]), who reside in the fictional Morg City. Treyarch describes the new characters as "troubled individuals" with "a long and sordid history of past misdeeds". The four characters are thrown into a twisted version of the city, overrun by zombies, and are guided by a mysterious, unreliable figure called the Shadowman ([[Robert Picardo]]).&lt;ref name="ignzombies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/09/comic-con-2015-black-ops-3s-zombies-cast-revealed|title=Comic Con 2015: Black Ops III's Zombies Cast Revealed|first=Steve|last=Butts|work=[[IGN]]|date=July 9, 2015|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Shadows of Evil" acts as a prologue that leads into the core storyline, focusing on the Dimension 63 version of the original characters: "Tank" Dempsey ([[Steven Blum]]), Nikolai Belinski ([[Fred Tatasciore]]), Takeo Masaki ([[Tom Kane]]) and Edward Richtofen ([[Nolan North]]), who were introduced in the ''Black Ops II'' map "Origins", referred to collectively as Primis.{{efn|Latin for "The First"}} Their story continues from where "Origins" left off, as they attempt to prevent [[Call of Duty: Black Ops#Story 2|the events of the original timeline]] from ever occurring across the multiverse. Other characters include the leader of Group 935, Doctor Ludvig Maxis (also voiced by Tatasciore), and his daughter Samantha.&lt;ref name="grzombies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/black-ops-3-zombies-giant-special-edition/|title=Black Ops 3 has a special-edition exclusive Zombies map|first=Conner|last=Sheridan|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=July 9, 2015|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The downloadable content maps feature the original versions of Primis, referred to as Ultimis,{{efn|Latin for "The Last"}} and reintroduce various minor characters mentioned/featured in previous games, including Group 935 scientist Doctor Groph (also voiced by Blum), the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] spy Peter McCain, Dr. Maxis' assistant Sophia (Christa Lewis),&lt;ref name="SophiaVA"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://twitter.com/LiquidBelles/status/847962033844891648 |title= I just uploaded "Christa Lewis BlackOPs3 For Internet" to #Vimeo|first=Christa G.|last=Lewis|work=[[Twitter]]|date=April 1, 2017|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ascension Group scientist Gersh, as well as introduces the mysterious omnipotent being Doctor Monty ([[Malcolm McDowell]]). Robert Picardo also briefly reprises his role from ''Call of Duty: Black Ops'' as United States Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]].

====Story====
{{Long plot|section|date=July 2018}}
Following [[Call of Duty: Black Ops II#Story|the battle against the undead outbreak in Northern France of Dimension 63]], Doctor Ludvig Maxis, whose brain resided in a mechanical drone at the time, arrives at Agartha and is given a new body by Doctor Monty, a self-proclaimed omnipotent being and member of the Order of the Keepers. After helping to cleanse the soul of his daughter Samantha from the original timeline, Monty instructs Maxis to retrieve an artifact called the Summoning Key, a powerful artifact that can fix their world back to its original state. To do so, Maxis instructs his friend Doctor Edward Richtofen to retrieve the Kronorium, an ancient book detailing the events of every universe and dimension, which contains the location of the Key.

After learning of the Key's location, Richtofen travels to Dimension 63 and arrives in Morg City in 1944, where the Apothicons, former Keepers who were corrupted and mutated by the dark energy of the [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], manipulated four individuals: Jessica Rose, a burlesque dancer; Jack Vincent, a corrupt cop; Floyd Campbell, an up-and-coming boxer; and Nero Blackstone, a washed-up magician. Misled into doing the bidding of an Apothicon named the Shadowman, the four opened a rift beneath the city using the Summoning Key, thereby freeing an ancient Apothicon beast. With the Keepers' aid, the four manage to trap the Shadowman inside the Key, and banish the beast from their dimension. Before they could retrieve the Summoning Key from the Keepers, however, Richtofen snags the Key from them, thanks them for their effort and exits through a portal, leaving the four and the rest of Dimension 63 to be doomed by the Apothicons. Richtofen travels to Dimension 2210 and collects the soul of his alternate self, then releases the soul to Agartha, where Monty gives the soul a child's body, and calls him Eddie.

The Dimension 63 versions of "Tank" Dempsey, Nikolai Belinski, and Takeo Masaki pursue Richtofen in his [[Multiverse|interdimensional journey]], and arrive in the Der Riese facility in the original timeline, only moments after Maxis and Samantha were teleported away by the original Richtofen. The three attempt to convince him to awaken their original selves, but are interrupted by the Dimension 63 Richtofen, who appears out of the teleporter and kills his counterpart, triggering various timeline fractures. The four then band together to fend off the zombie horde once more; eventually, they activates a beacon within the facility, allowing Maxis to locate them from Agartha.

In pursuit of the original Dempsey, the four then travel to Der Eisendrache, Group 935's fortress in [[Austria]]. Despite Group 935 member Doctor Groph's attempt at preventing the group from retrieving the test subject, he ultimately fails and perishes when Richtofen overrides the castle's defense system and sends a barrage of missiles towards the moon. As the four retrieve the original Dempsey, Richtofen reveals his plan to prevent their original incarnations from wreaking havoc upon the universe. Dimension 63 Dempsey then volunteers to kill his own counterpart before allowing Richtofen to absorb his soul with the Key.

Afterwards, the group attempts to teleport to a new fractured timeline to locate the original Takeo, who is held prisoner at a Pacific island by the Japanese research group Division 9. They discover that Division 9 had been experimenting with plant life mutation using Element 115, with the original Takeo also a victim of the experimentation. After they manage to release him from the mutation, Dimension 63 Takeo is shocked to learn that the [[Emperor of Japan]] betrayed his original self and sent him to this island out of petty jealousy. The original Takeo proceeds to commit [[seppuku]], with his Dimension 63 self decapitating him. After absorbing the original Takeo's soul with the Key, Richtofen takes the crew to [[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]] in Dimension 63, where they retrieve several blood vials, the purpose of which he refuses to explain at the time.

The crew then teleports to another fractured timeline and lands in a war-torn [[Stalingrad]] in 1945, where the [[Soviet Union]] has stolen Group 935's technology to create their own giant robots and mechanical soldiers, while [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] is aided by ancient [[dragon]]s resurrected and bred by Division 9. As the crew traverses across the city, they are forced to help Sophia, Maxis' former assistant who has been transformed into a machine, to initiate the Ascension Protocol, allowing her to gain knowledge of interdimensional travel. Monty also introduces himself to the crew, as he informs them of the state of the multiverse. Amidst the chaos, the original Nikolai, who has taken control of a modified drone unit, teams up with the group to destroy the alpha dragon. However, upon the dragon's death, Nikolai refuses to surrender, forcing the four to take out his drone. The original Nikolai is angered by his Dimension 63 self as he mentions their deceased wife, and attempts to shoot him, only to be killed in retaliation. With all souls collected, Richtofen calls out to Maxis to summon a portal, and release the souls into it.

The group returns to Agartha and arrives in "The House", a place built by Monty to prevent all forces of evil from infecting it, ensuring the safety of the children (Samantha and cleansed versions of the original souls in child form). After sealing off the House from the rest of the multiverse, Maxis is manipulated by the voice of the Shadowman into releasing him upon contact with the Summoning Key. The Shadowman then uses his power to merge various other dimensions, including the Dark Aether, allowing the Apothicons to enter and wreak havoc. Richtofen and the crew manage to help Sophia enter the dimension, and with her assistance, retrieve the Summoning Key and the Kronorium. They then confront the Shadowman together, and defeat him once and for all using the combined power of the two artifacts. Maxis, who still resides within the Key, then absorbs the souls of the children into the Key, and joins Sophia as they fly toward the Apothicon sun, banishing all Apothicon presences from Agartha. Richtofen and the crew are able to remain in the dimension without fading from existence, thanks to the blood vials they retrieved earlier. Monty, worried about the four becoming a paradox in his perfect world, contemplates between erasing their existence and sending them to a distant corner of the universe. In a moment, the four begin to fade away, then reappear in ancient medieval times, where they would be remembered as "Primis", heroes who aided the Keepers in sealing away the Apothicons in the Great War, effectively "completing the cycle" of the universe.

==Development==
''Call of Duty: Black Ops III'' is the twelfth game in the ''Call of Duty'' franchise, and the fourth entry in the ''[[Call of Duty#Black Ops story arc|Black Ops]]'' series. The game was the second to benefit under publisher [[Activision]]'s three-year development cycle, the first being ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]''. The cycle allows each of the development teams of the ''Call of Duty'' series ([[Infinity Ward]], [[Treyarch]], and [[Sledgehammer Games]]) to develop games in a three-year timespan, as opposed to the two allowed previously. ''Black Ops III'' uses a heavily modified version of the [[IW engine]] used previously in ''Black Ops II''.&lt;ref name="Twitter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/pcdev/status/594126768652423169|title=pcdev on Twitter: @treboruk92 Heavily modified from BO2 including completely new renderer|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
On September 29, 2015, the official [[Twitter]] account of ''Call of Duty'' was temporarily renamed to "Current Events Aggregate". It then began tweeting messages about real-life fashion, movies and a terrorist attack that takes place in Singapore. Activision later revealed that these tweets are fake, and served to promote the game's story campaign.&lt;ref name="IGNStunt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/12/treyarch-shocked-by-reaction-to-call-of-duty-black-ops-3-twitter-marketing-stunt|title=Treyarch Shocked By Reaction To Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 Twitter Marketing Stunt|first=Luke|last=Karmali|work=[[IGN]]|date=October 12, 2015|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marketing campaign was strongly criticized for faking news, and publisher Activision was blamed for being "irresponsible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/9/29/9419597/who-approved-this-tacky-call-of-duty-black-ops-3-stunt|title=Who approved this tacky Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 stunt?|first=Allegra|last=Frank|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=September 29, 2015|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/opinion-activisions-black-ops-3-publicity-stunt-is-irresponsible|title=Opinion: Activision's Black Ops 3 Publicity Stunt Is Irresponsible|first=Mitch|last=Dyer|work=[[IGN]]|date=September 29, 2015|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's director Jason Blundell said that the team was "shocked" by the negative reaction of the marketing campaign,&lt;ref name="IGNStunt"/&gt; and offered an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/treyarch-is-very-sorry-about-that-black-ops-3-tweet-315222.phtml|title=Treyarch is 'very sorry' about that Black Ops 3 tweet|first=Vikki|last=Blake|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=October 13, 2015|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-order===
''Call of Duty: Black Ops III'' and the Digital Deluxe Edition counterpart were available to pre-order on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The Digital Deluxe Edition comes with the season pass, which can also be ordered separately. Pre-ordering provided access to the ''Call of Duty: Black Ops III'' multiplayer beta and in-game items for ''Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare'', such as custom reticles, an emblem, a calling card, and Advanced Supply Drops.&lt;ref name="GameSpot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-gamestop-pre-order-bonuse/1100-6426918/|title=Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 GameStop Pre-Order Bonuses Revealed|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|date=April 27, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony also announced that the ''Black Ops III'' beta would come to the PS4 first on August 19 through August 23, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charlieintel.com/2015/07/12/black-ops-3-multiplayer-beta-is-exclusive-to-ps4-from-august-19th-through-august-23rd/|title=Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 multiplayer beta start and end dates for PS4|date=July 12, 2015|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beta for the PS4 went live on August 18, 2015, several hours earlier than originally announced.&lt;ref name="Playstation.com"/&gt; After the beta period ended, it was announced that all pre-orders would include the bonus multiplayer map "NUK3TOWN", a remake of the original "Nuketown" map, featured in ''Call of Duty: Black Ops'', and in ''Call of Duty: Black Ops II'' as "Nuketown 2025". Owing to the lack of the campaign mode, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions included a digital copy of ''Black Ops'' as an added bonus, as well as having their price reduced by 10 dollars compared to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.callofduty.com/t5/Call-of-Duty-Blog-Black-Ops-III/New-Details-For-PS3-and-Xbox-360-Versions-of-Call-of-Duty-Black/ba-p/9913435|title=New Details For PS3 and Xbox 360 Versions of Call of Duty: Black Ops III|date=September 25, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics tie-in===
A [[comic book]] titled ''Call of Duty: Black Ops III'' was announced on July 1, 2015. Serving as a prequel to the game, the first issue was released worldwide on November 4, 2015 and was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]]. The story is written by [[Larry Hama]], while [[Marcelo Ferreira]] served as the artist for the comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/01/comic-con-dark-horse-deploys-call-of-duty-black-ops-3-comic-book|title=Comic Con-Dark Horse Deploys Call Of Duty: Black Ops III Comic Book|first=Joshua|last=Yehl|work=[[IGN]]|date=July 1, 2015|accessdate=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story takes place several years prior to the main events of the game, and stars Jacob Hendricks and John Taylor along with their black ops squadmates in an attempt to stop a Russian terrorist plot. Subsequent issues were released throughout 2016.

On July 11, 2016, Treyarch announced a new comic book series titled ''[[Call of Duty: Zombies (comic series)|Call of Duty: Zombies]]'', to expand upon the story of the Zombies mode. The story features the return of the TranZit team: Abigail "Misty" Briarton, Marlton Johnson, Russman and Samuel Stuhlinger, previously the main protagonists of ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]]'', as they embark on a search for an artifact known as the Kronorium, while discovering the truth behind Edward Richtofen's reappearance. The miniseries, also published by Dark Horse, features Justin Jordan as the writer and Jonathan Wayshak as the main artist, while Simon Bisley draws the cover art of each issue. The first issue was released on October 28, 2016, and subsequent issues were released throughout 2017.

===Special editions and downloadable content===
In addition to the Digital Deluxe Edition, other special editions include the ''Hardened Edition'' and the ''Juggernog Edition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/589854/Black-Ops-3-PS4-Call-of-Duty-beta-release-date-Sony-Activision-Black-Ops-Zombies-Mode|title=Black Ops 3 PS4: Call of Duty team debut Zombies Mode trailer and new story update|first=Gary|last=Jones|work=[[Express.co.uk]]|date=July 10, 2015|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Juggernog Edition'' includes a mini-refrigerator, a season pass and multiple in-game content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/07/09/black-ops-3-collectors-edition-mini-fridge/|title=This Black Ops 3 Collector's Edition contains an actual, working appliance|first=Stephany|last=Nunneley|work=[[VG247]]|date=July 9, 2015|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Collector's Edition bonus map for the Zombie mode, ''The Giant'' was announced.

It features the multiplayer mode's core mechanics, though certain features, such as the Zombie mode and the Nightmare mode, were excluded. This version of the game is available for players to purchase until the end of February 2016, though it has been made available permanently since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-02-16-call-of-duty-black-ops-3-releases-multiplayer-only-starter-pack|title=Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 releases multiplayer-only Starter Pack|first=Jeffery|last=Matulef|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, during Sony's PlayStation Experience event, Activision announced the first downloadable content map pack for ''Black Ops III'', titled ''Awakening'', and was released first on PlayStation 4 on February 2, 2016. Releases for [[Xbox One]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] happened in March 2016. The map pack contains four new multiplayer maps: Skyjacked, Rise, Splashed, and Gauntlet, a new Zombies map, Der Eisendrache, and several new gumballs for the Zombie mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-3s-first-dlc-awakening-date/1100-6433289/|title=Call of Duty: Black Ops 3's First DLC, Awakening, Dated on PS4|first=Chris|last=Pereira |date=December 21, 2015|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, Treyarch revealed the second Map Pack, titled "Eclipse". The map pack has four new multiplayer maps, including a remake of the ''World at War'' map "Bonzai" and a new Zombies map, "Zetsubou no Shima".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-second-dlc-pack-eclipse-announced|title=Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 - Second Dlc Pack, Eclipse Announced}}&lt;/ref&gt; The map pack was released on April 19 for PlayStation 4 and May 19 for Xbox One and PC.

The third map pack, Descent, was revealed on June 28, 2016, featuring four new MP maps, including a remake of the ''Black Ops II'' map "Raid" and a new Zombies map, "Gorod Krovi". The map pack was released on July 12 for PlayStation 4 and August 11 for Xbox One and PC. The PC release of Descent received controversy, for Activision and Treyarch announced that the map packs would no longer be sold separately, and PC players must purchase the season pass to receive all map packs, while owners of Awakening and/or Eclipse would receive discounts upon purchasing the season pass. The fourth map pack, Salvation, was revealed on August 25, 2016, with remakes of the MP maps "Standoff" from ''Black Ops II'' and "Outskirt" from ''World at War'', along with the final Zombies map, "Revelations". The map pack was released on September 6 for PlayStation 4, and October 6 for Xbox One and PC.

A fifth and final map pack, Zombies Chronicles, contains remastered versions of 8 Zombies maps from previous games: "Nacht Der Untoten", "Verrückt", and "Shi no Numa" from ''World at War'', "Kino Der Toten", "Ascension", "Shangri-La", and "Moon" from ''Black Ops'', and "Origins" from ''Black Ops II'', and is not included in the season pass of the game. The map pack was released on May 16, 2017 for PlayStation 4, and June 16 for Xbox One and PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zwOnvnM1Fw&amp;app=desktop|title=Jason Blundell ARRIVES... w/ Something Very Special!

On May 24, 2017, Activision and Treyarch announced a Multiplayer DLC Trial Pack for the PC version of Black Ops III, allowing all players to play on all multiplayer maps from the four map packs for free for a limited time, while also offering XP bonuses to players who previously owned the map packs and/or the season pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.callofduty.com/t5/Treyarch-Blog/Multiplayer-DLC-Trial-Pack-PC/ba-p/10261608|title=Multiplayer DLC Trial Pack (PC)|author=Foxhound-Pro|last=|date=May 24, 2017|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20, 2018, the Zombies maps from the four map packs were made available for separate purchase on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with PC to follow on May 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://charlieintel.com/2018/03/20/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-zombies-dlc-maps-now-available-for-separate-purchase/|title=Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 Zombies DLC maps now available for separate purchase|first=Keshav|last=Bhat |date=March 20, 2018|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 11, 2018, Activision and Treyarch announced the "Back in Black" map pack, which contains four remastered versions of fan-favorite multiplayer maps from ''Black Ops'' and ''Black Ops II'': "Summit", "Jungle", "Firing Range", and "Slums".

According to review aggregator [[Metacritic]], ''Call of Duty: Black Ops III'' received "generally favorable" critic reviews for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and "mixed or average" critic reviews for PC.&lt;ref name="MCXONE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt; [[GameSpot]] awarded it a score of 7 out of 10, saying, "''Black Ops III'' doesn't offer anything remarkable to the series, but does just enough to maintain the ''Call of Duty'' status quo. The franchise, however slowly, continues its inexorable march."&lt;ref name="GSpot" /&gt; [[Polygon]] also gave the game a score of 7 out of 10, saying "''Black Ops III''{{'}}s biggest point of recommendation may be the breadth of content there, and that's a valid point of view. But Treyarch doesn't meaningfully move the series forward here."&lt;ref name="Poly" /&gt; [[IGN]] awarded it a score of 9.2 out of 10, saying "With fun 4-player co-op, new powers, and a fleshed out Zombies mode, ''Black Ops 3'' is the biggest ''Call of Duty'' game yet."&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt;

Despite earning positive reviews, there were some criticism. The campaign was heavily criticized for it's story and the absence of fan favourite story mode characters. Stuart Andrews of Trusted Reviews stated in his review: "The only problem is that, as with all all-you-can-eat buffets, some portions are a lot tastier than others, leaving you wondering whether a little more focus might have created something really exceptional. ''Black Ops 3'' is a solid installment that will please the series' hardcore fans, but it's not a mainstream crowd-pleaser in the way that last year's ''Advanced Warfare'' was. In a way, it suffers because of ''Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare''. The first ''Black Ops'' bought a very distinctive flavour to Call of Duty; one born of conspiracy theory, spy thrillers and darker style of storytelling. The second mixed that up with a sci-fi techno-thriller, splitting the action between interleaved, branching past and near-future storylines and bringing bots and drones into the mix. ''Black Ops 3''{{'}}s focuses entirely on the sci-fi stuff, loses most of its conspiracy theory trappings and brings augmented super-soldiers in. The result sometimes feels less like a third ''Black Ops'' game than ''Call of Duty'': Even More ''Advanced Warfare''. It leaves you wondering whether it's time ''Call of Duty'' looked back to the past for inspiration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-3 |title=Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 |last=Andrews |first=Stuart |date=16 December 2016 |access-date=8 July 2018 |work=[[Trusted Reviews]] |publisher=[[TI Media Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collaborative pedagogy''' stems from the [[theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy|process theory of rhetoric and composition]]. Collaborative pedagogy believes that students will better engage with [[writing]], [[critical thinking]], and [[wikt:revising|revision]] if they engage with others.&lt;ref&gt;Bruffee, Kenneth A. “Collaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 545 – 562. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative pedagogy pushes back against the Current-Traditional model of writing, as well as other earlier theories explaining rhetoric and composition; earlier theories of writing, especially [[Theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy#Current-traditional rhetoric|current-traditional]], emphasizes writing as a final product (completed individually). In contrast, collaborative pedagogy rejects the notion that students think, learn, and write in isolation. Collaborative pedagogy strives to maximize critical thinking, [[learning]], and writing skills through interaction and inter-personal engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Wayne Campbell et al. “Community Literacy.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies.Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 1097 – 1116. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative pedagogy also connects to the broader theory of [[collaborative learning]], which encompasses other disciplines including, but not limited to, [[education]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]].

In the rhetoric and composition discourse community, there exists much support for and debate about the use of collaborative learning in the classroom. Although collaborative pedagogy deals with the strategies associated with promoting engagement, critical thinking, and inclusivity, these theorists underscore collaborative pedagogy’s link to [[cultural studies]], [[argumentation]], community [[literacy]], [[Academic discourse#Academic discourse|academic discourse]], and university standards and policy connected with [[first-year composition]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomae, David. “Inventing the University.” When a Writer Can’t Write. Ed. Mike Rose. New York: Guildford, 1985. 134–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions of collaborative pedagogy also emerge in the [[Technical writing|technical communication]] field, a subset of rhetoric and composition. Technical communication incorporates collaborative pedagogy by attempting to bridge real work environments with university classrooms through group assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee, Ann M. “Bridging the Workplace and the Academy: Teaching Professional Genres through Classroom-Workplace Collaborations.” Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom. Ed. James M. Dubinsky. 348–391. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorists in rhetoric and composition==

There are many rhetoric and composition theorists who explore collaborative pedagogy in their body of work. These theorists include, but are not limited to, [[Kenneth Bruffee|Kenneth A. Bruffee]], [[Cultural studies theory of composition|John Trimbur]], Joseph Harris, and Wayne Campbell Peck, [[Linda Flower]], and Lorraine Higgins. Kenneth Bruffee sees collaborative pedagogical strategies as natural to the learning process, more than individual thinking and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bruffee, Kenneth A. “Collaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 545 – 562. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; John Trimbur defines collaboration as admitting both dissent and agreement, and thinks that collaboration should not aim only for agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Trimbur, John. “Consensus and Difference in Collaborative Learning.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 733 – 747. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Harris thinks that the university sometimes adversarial to collaborative pedagogy, since individual product is more highly valued.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Joseph. “The Idea of Community in the Study of Writing” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 748 – 758. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Peck, Flower, and Higgins champion collaborative pedagogy as pivotal to reconciling various cultural, social, and socioeconomic difference.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Wayne Campbell et al. “Community Literacy.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies.Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 1097 – 1116. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support and critique==
===As an aid to a natural state of interaction===

In “Collaboration and the ‘Conversation of Mankind’,” Kenneth A. Bruffee cites thinking out loud and collaborating as natural states of learning, because they mimic the process of earlier stages of development. Citing [[Michael Oakeshott]], Bruffee argues that “[w]e first experience and learn ‘the skill and partnership of conversation,’ in the external arena of direct social exchange with other people. Only then do we learn to displace that ‘skill and partnership by playing silently with ourselves, in imagination, the parts of all the participants in the conversation”.&lt;ref&gt;Bruffee, Kenneth A. “Collaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 545 – 562. Print., p.549&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, he believes that the concepts of independent learning and thinking are more like social constructs than a natural state of being. Despite believing in Oakeshott’s theories about collaborative learning being natural, he acknowledges the difficulty of blending this with the independent and authoritative environment of the classroom, especially the college first-year composition classroom. Bruffee confronts the overarching fact that “[h]umanistic study, we have been led to believe, is a solitary life, and the vitality of the humanities lies in the talents and endeavors of each of us as individuals”.&lt;ref&gt;Bruffee, Kenneth A. “Collaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 545 – 562. Print., p. 550&lt;/ref&gt; On a more minute level, collaborative pedagogy becomes problematic for instructors who worry that classrooms will spiral out of control, in “…an adversarial activity pitting individual against individual”.&lt;ref&gt;Bruffee, Kenneth A. “Collaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 545 – 562. Print., p. 550&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bruffee thinks that if composition instructors and scholars believe in writing and learning as a process from which everyone can benefit, then it is important to forge community through collaboration, despite the individualist discourse of the university.

===As crossing socioeconomic boundaries===

Wayne Campbell Peck et al. view collaborative pedagogy in a positive light, due to its success at the Community Literacy Center (CLC), which pairs inner-city high school students with student mentors from [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. They describe a curriculum encouraging students to write responses to the real world situations they face, such as writing their school administrators about detention policies.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Wayne Campbell et al. “Community Literacy.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies.Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 1097–1116. Print., p. 1107&lt;/ref&gt; Peck et al. justify the need for their program by positing that, “…beyond cultural appreciation, we believe that the next, more difficult step in community-building is to create an intercultural dialogue that allows people to confront and solve problems across racial and economic boundaries”.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Wayne Campbell et al. “Community Literacy.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies.Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 1097 – 1116. Print., p. 1101&lt;/ref&gt; Their program attempts to reach this goal of inter-cultural dialogue by promoting multiple levels of interaction and understanding. First, the mentors from Carnegie Mellon and the inner-city youth must reach mutual understanding to promote clearer communication. Next, the students and administrators need to remain open to the others’ perspectives to develop stronger community. Last, the program coordinators need to view all parties involved as equal stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Wayne Campbell et al. “Community Literacy.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies.Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 1097 – 1116. Print., p. 1107–1111&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, they argue that their program, while often fraught with conflict, helps stakeholders in different positions understand varying perspectives about issues in their local community, and that this learning process is both necessary and beneficial.

===As counter intuitive to university culture and community===

A critique of collaborative pedagogy is that it juxtaposes the individual work production valued within the university. In “The Idea of Community in the Study of Writing,” Joseph Harris echoes Bruffee’s sentiments that the community and individual work at cross-purposes within the university setting. He claims that although the term "collaborative" usually connotes a positive sense of belonging, community in reality often creates an “us versus them” mentality, and also creating a dichotomy between individual and group, or in this case, student versus university. He wonders, “If to enter the academic community a student must ‘learn to speak our language’ [in reference to David Bartholomae’s “Inventing the University”], and become accustomed and reconciled to our ways of doing things with words, then how exactly is she to do this?”.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Joseph. “The Idea of Community in the Study of Writing” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 748 – 758. Print., p.753&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of inclusion, exclusion, community, and individual relate to collaborative pedagogy, because first-year composition instructors struggle to promote critical thinking and collaborative learning, while also meeting the demands of college-level writing. Harris does not provide much consolation to this problem, except to say that students need to learn to navigate the complexities of individual and community identity.

===As critical engagement===

John Trimbur both supports and critiques collaborative pedagogy, but his support is predicated upon adjusting the views of both conflict and resolution. His article, “Consensus and Difference in [[Collaborative learning|Collaborative Learning]]," focuses on redefining the definition of “[[consensus]]” as it applies to collaborative pedagogy the first-year composition classroom. He argues that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;To develop a critical version of collaborative learning, we will need to distinguish between consensus as an acculturative practice that reproduces business as usual and consensus as an oppositional one that challenges the prevailing conditions of production. The point of collaborative learning is not simply to demystify the authority of knowledge by revealing its social character but to transform the productive apparatus, to change the social character of production. In this regard, it will help to cast consensus not as a “real world” practice but as a utopian one (Trimbur, 743).&lt;ref&gt;Trimbur, John. “Consensus and Difference in Collaborative Learning.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 733 – 747. Print., p. 743&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After he links collaborative learning with his notion of the roll of consensus, he claims that “The revised notion of consensus I am proposing here depends paradoxically on its deferral, not its realization. I am less interested in students achieving consensus…as their using consensus as a critical to open gaps in the conversation through which differences may emerge”.&lt;ref&gt;Trimbur, John. “Consensus and Difference in Collaborative Learning.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 733–747. Print., p.745&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of consensus helps students build community and collaboration by grappling with issues that do not lend themselves so easily to consensus as agreement.

==Theorists in technical communication==

There are many technical communication scholars who explore collaborative pedagogy in their body of work. These theorists include, but are not limited to, Aviva Freedman, Christine Adam, Ann M. Blakeslee, and Robert J. Johnson. Aviva Freedman and Christine Adam view the traditional classroom model as detrimental to students/future employees, because the classroom prevents critical thinking, independence, collaboration, and cooperation between coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, Aviva and Christine Adam. “Learning to Write Professionally: ‘Situated Learning’ and the Transition from University to Professional Discourse.” Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom. Ed. James M. Dubinsky. 310–336. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Ann M. Blakeslee believes that the classroom and the workplace can blend together for new learning, as long as both parties remain open to communication.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee, Ann M. “Bridging the Workplace and the Academy: Teaching Professional Genres through Classroom-Workplace Collaborations.” Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom. Ed. James M. Dubinsky. 348–391. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Robert J. Johnson thinks that writing is inherently collaborative, because technical writers have to acknowledge live audiences to accomplish real and necessary tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Robert J. "Audience Involved: Toward a Participatory Model of Writing." College Composition and Communication 14 (1997): 361–376. JSTOR. 7 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical communication views collaborative pedagogy===

The works of the [[Scholarly method|scholars]] listed above and in the references section primarily deal with the [[wikt:conundrum|conundrum]] of preparing students for [[Collaborative working environment|collaborative work environments]], when most of their work occurs individually and in a [[classroom]] environment. Freedman and Adam worry that the classroom creates trained in capacities in students, preventing them from adapting to a work world where authoritative boundaries are blurred and most stakeholders are equal.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, Aviva and Christine Adam. “Learning to Write Professionally: ‘Situated Learning’ and the Transition from University to Professional Discourse.” Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom. Ed. James M. Dubinsky. 310–336. Print., pp. 325–327&lt;/ref&gt; Blakeslee notes that even when instructors try to bring the “real world” into the classroom, businesses and students still struggle to communicate clearly.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee, Ann M. “Bridging the Workplace and the Academy: Teaching Professional Genres through Classroom-Workplace Collaborations.” Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom. Ed. James M. Dubinsky. 348–391. Print., p.365 – 367&lt;/ref&gt; Robert J. Johnson makes the theoretical claim that [[Prewriting#Motivation and audience awareness|audience awareness]] is central to technical communication as a practice, but that the university purposefully separates writer from audience, which does not promote collaborative pedagogy or learning.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Robert J. "Audience Involved: Toward a Participatory Model of Writing." College Composition and Communication 14 (1997): 361–376. JSTOR. 7 Nov. 2012., p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; However, he further argues that for communication to succeed in any setting, audience must be “involved” rather than removed from the process of communicating.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Robert J. "Audience Involved: Toward a Participatory Model of Writing." College Composition and Communication 14 (1997): 361–376. JSTOR. 7 Nov. 2012., p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Comics navbar|title=Comic book collecting}}
'''Comic book collecting''' is a [[hobby]] that treats [[comic books]] and related items as [[collectible]]s or [[Visual arts|artwork]] to be sought after and preserved. Though considerably more recent than the collecting of [[postage stamp]]s ([[philately]]) or [[book]]s ([[bibliophilia]]), it has a major following around the world today and is partially responsible for the increased interest in comics after the temporary slump experienced during the 1980s.

==Overview==
Comics are collected for several possible reasons, including appreciation, nostalgia, financial profit, and completion of the collection. The [[comic book]] came to light in the [[popular culture|pop culture]] arena in the 1930s due to the popularity of [[superhero]] characters [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. Since the 1960s, two publishers have dominated the American comic book industry: [[Marvel Comics]], publisher of such comics as ''[[Spider-Man]]'', ''[[X-Men]]'', and ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', and [[DC Comics]], which publishes titles such as ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'', ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'', and ''[[Wonder Woman]]''. Other large non-[[manga]] publishers include [[Image Comics]], [[IDW Publishing|IDW]], and [[Dark Horse Comics]].

As comic books regained their popularity in the 1960s during the boom of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], fans organized [[comic book convention]]s, where they could meet to discuss their favorite comics with each other and eventually with the creators themselves. {{As of|2010}}, &lt;!-- How many? --&gt;numerous conventions and festivals are held around the world, with [[Comic-Con International]] held annually in San Digo, being the largest and best-known convention in the United States.

While some people collect comic books for personal interest in the medium or characters, others prefer to collect for profit. To assist both types of comic book collector, [[comic book price guide]]s are available and provide estimates of comic book values as well as information on comic book creators and characters. The price guides assign values for comic books based on demand, availability, and the copy's condition. The longest running price guide is the annual [[Overstreet|''Overstreet Price Guide'']], first published in 1970. Another current monthly price guide is ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]''. The growth of the Internet in the late 1990s saw development of online [[database]]s to track creator, character appearances, and storylines, as well as websites combining comic book price guides with personalized collection tracking to provide collection values in real-time. The [[Grand Comics Database]] is a popular online resource for comic book creator and character information. Popular online price guide and collection tracking services include [http://comicbookrealm.com comicbookrealm.com], [http://www.comicspriceguide.com comicspriceguide.com], and GPAnalysis. The increased popularity of online auctioning services like [[eBay]] or [[Heritage Auctions]] for buying and selling comic books has greatly increased the visibility of actual comic book sale prices, leading to improved price guide accuracy, particularly for online price guides such as comicspriceguide.com and GPAnalysis. GPA only tracks sales of slabbed books, and therefore is not an accurate indicator of overall comic sales.

In response to collectors' interest in preserving their collections, products designed for the protection and storage of comic books became available, &lt;!-- when? --&gt;including special bags; boxes; and acid-free "backing boards", designed to keep the comic book flat.

==History==

=== Origins ===
Before the late 1960s, virtually no specialized comic stores existed and the notion of comics as collectible art was in its infancy. A few collector-based retail establishments existed, most notably [[Pop Hollinger]]'s retail and mail order shop for new and used comics in [[Concordia, Kansas]], which was in full swing by 1940. Claude Held had followed suit in [[Buffalo, New York]], by 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1t8g_yX1wcC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;lpg=PA260&amp;dq=%2B%22concordia,+kansas%22+%2B%22fiction%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%2B%22concordia%2C%20kansas%22%20%2B%22fiction%22&amp;f=false|title=Of comics and men: a cultural history of American comic books|author1=Jean-Paul Gabilliet|accessdate=April 26, 2011|page=260|ISBN=978-1-60473-267-2|year=2010|publisher=University Press of Mississippi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of comic book collecting as an organized hobby has its roots in early [[science fiction]] fandom and [[comic book letters page]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Founders of Comic Fandom|publisher=McFarland Publishing |date=July 9, 2010|author=Schelly, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s, [[DC Comics]] began publishing the full addresses of the people writing in, which allowed comic fans to reach out to each other.&lt;ref name="schelly"&gt;The first letters page with the letter writers' full addresses appeared in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #35 (May 1961): Schelly, Bill. ''The Golden Age of Comic Fandom'', Hamster Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US a few specialist shops had opened their doors by the 1960s, but were still a small market. In the UK, the only distribution channels available were ordinary news stands and [[mail order]] publications like ''Exchange and Mart'' or through [[zines]] run by the early panelologists themselves. Denver, Colorado-based retailer [[Chuck Rozanski]] played a large role in the growth of the comics speculation market in 1977 when he acquired the high-value "Mile High Collection" — 16,000 comic books dating from 1937 to 1955 — and slowly began releasing select books into the marketplace.&lt;ref name=Hayner&gt;Hayner, Don. "Big bucks in rare comics — Classic find in '77 began a new era," ''Chicago Sun-Times''(July 26, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1970s–early 1980s major comic publishers like [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]&lt;ref&gt;"Marvel Focuses On Direct Sales," ''The Comics Journal'' #59 (October 1980), pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DC Comics]] started to recognize the new movements and started publishing material that was intended for sale in specialist shops only. When Marvel tested the new comics specialty market with the title ''[[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]'' in 1981, the comic sold over 400,000 copies, a very respectable figure and one that astounded the company. Hereafter, comics publishers started tailoring ever-increasing percentages of marketing and production solely for the sale in specialist stores. While the bulk of the revenues still came from sales through regular channels, the ability to focus more specifically on specific target groups as well as distributing comics not on a sale-or-return basis, but in limited runs according to sales predictions from the retailers themselves, over-printing and overhead costs could be drastically reduced. From the 1970s to the present day, comics publishers have been targeting more and more of their titles to collector audiences with features such as limited editions, the use of high quality paper, or the inclusion of novelty items.

===The speculator boom===
[[File:Silversurfer 50.jpg|thumb|left|A foil embossed [[Comics Guaranty LLC|CGC]]-graded and authenticated copy of ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' #50. Signed by [[Stan Lee]]]]

From roughly 1985 through 1993, comic book [[speculation]] reached its highest peaks. This boom period began with the publication of titles like ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and ''[[Watchmen]]'' and "summer [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] epics" like ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and ''[[Secret Wars]]''.&lt;ref name=Hayner /&gt; After ''Watchmen'' and ''Dark Knight Returns'' made their mark, mainstream attention returned to the comic book industry in 1989 with the success of the movie ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and again in 1992 with "[[The Death of Superman]]" storyline.

Once aware of this niche market, the mainstream press focused on its potential for making money. Features appeared in newspapers, magazines and television shows detailing how rare, high-demand comics such as ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1 and ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' #181 (the first appearances of [[Superman]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], respectively) had sold for  thousands of dollars, with ''Action'' # 1 breaking the $1 million mark.&lt;ref name="CBGXtra"&gt;Miller, John Jackson. [http://www.cbgxtra.com/default.aspx?tabid=42&amp;view=topic&amp;forumid=34&amp;postid=6606 "Nov. 17, 1992: A $30 Million Day — and the Days After,"] "The 1900s: 10 biggest events from 100 years in comics," CBGXtra.com (Dec. 12, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, mainstream comic book publishers began to pander specifically to the collectors' market. Techniques used included [[variant cover]]s, [[polybag]]s, and [[gimmick]] covers. When a comic was polybagged, the collector had to choose between either reading the comic book or keeping it in pristine condition for potential financial gain, or buying two or more copies to do both. Gimmicks included glow-in-the-dark, hologram-enhanced, die-cut, embossing, foil stamped or foil-embossed covers.&lt;ref name="CBGXtra" /&gt; Gimmicks were almost entirely cosmetic in nature, and almost never extended to improved content of the comics. However, many speculators would buy multiple copies of these issues, anticipating that demand would allow them to sell them for a substantial profit in the future.

Low-budget independent publishers also proliferated during this period. The low price of producing comics, and the ease and efficiency of the direct market enabled fly-by-night publishers to flood the market with product, much of it of low quality.&lt;ref&gt;Hass, Nancy. "Comic-Book Sleaze Albany Publisher Vexed About Quick-Buck Artists," ''Albany Times'' Union (Dec. 14, 1986): Business News: pE1.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of these publishers attempted to cash in on current trends — for every ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (itself a nod to the popularity of the ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]''), there were multitudes of blatant rip-offs like ''[[Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters]]'', ''Geriatric Gangrene Jujitsu Gerbils'', and ''Pre-Teen Dirty Gene Kung-Fu Kangaroos''.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel, Mitchell. [http://www.thegeektwins.com/2010/10/5-best-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle.html#.UTpRwaUVPSE "5 'Best' Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Parodies,"] Geek Twins (Oct. 6, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also saw a corresponding expansion in price guide publications, most notably [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'' Magazine]], which helped fuel the speculator boom with monthly columns such as the "Wizard Top 10" (highlighting the "hottest" back-issues of the month), "Market Watch" (which not only reported back-issue market trends, but also predicted future price trends), and "Comic Watch" (highlighting key "undervalued" back-issues).

The speculators who made a profit or at least broke even on their comic book "investments" did so only by selling to other speculators.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In truth, very few of the comics produced in the early 1990s have retained their value in the current market; with hundreds of thousands (or, in several prominent cases, over ten million) copies produced of certain issues, the value of these comics has all but disappeared. "Hot" comics like ''X-Men'' #1 and ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'' #1 can today be found selling for under a dollar apiece.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Veteran comic book fans pointed out an important fact about the high value of classic comic books that was largely overlooked by the speculators: original comic books of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] were genuinely rare. Most of the original comic books had not survived to the present era, having been thrown out in the trash or discarded as worthless children's waste (just like [[baseball cards]] typically were at that time) by parents (stories of uncaring parents throwing out their kids' comic book collections are well known to the [[post-WW2 baby boom|Baby Boom]] generation), or recycled along with other periodicals in the paper [[drive (charity)|drives]] of [[World War II]]. As a result, a comic book of interest to fans or collectors published during the 1940s through the 1960s, such as an original issue of ''Superman,'' ''Captain America,'' ''Challengers of the Unknown,'' or ''Vault of Horror,'' was often extremely difficult to find and thus highly prized by collectors, in a manner similar to coin collectors seeking copies of the [[1955 doubled die cent]]. In many ways, with an enormous supply of high-grade copies, the "hot" comics of the speculator boom were the complete opposite.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Bust of the speculator market===
The comic book speculator market reached a saturation point in the early 1990s and finally collapsed between 1993 through 1997. Two-thirds of all comic book specialty stores closed in this time period,&lt;ref name="CBGXtra" /&gt; and numerous publishers were driven out of business. Even industry giant [[Marvel Comics]] was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1997, although they were able to continue publishing. It is surmised that one of the main factors in Marvel's downfall was the decision to switch to self-distribution (via their purchase of [[Heroes World Distribution]]). Up until then, many publishers went through secondary distributors (such as the current and only mass distributor, [[Diamond Comic Distributors]]) and Marvel felt it could preserve some of its cash flow if it made the move to becoming one of the few publishers to also distribute directly to the comic market. This backfired terribly when the bottom fell out of the market, as they were stocked with multiple printings of variant and "collectible" issues that were no longer in high demand and they could not cover the costs of their distribution service.

The bust can also be linked back to some of the series that caused the boom, a few years earlier. [[DC Comics|DC's]] decision to publish two blockbuster stories depicting the loss of their two major superheroes ("[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]" — the breaking of the Batman — and "[[The Death of Superman]]"), and their subsequent flooding of the press as to their supposed finality, is considered by some collectors to have started a slow decay within the non-regular buyer comic community which then led to drops in sales. Many comic retailers believe that numerous comic speculators took the death and crippling of two major characters to signify the end of the Batman and Superman series. As many comic readers and retailers knew full well, very little in comics actually changes with any finality. Many aspects of the status quo returned after the story arcs were over (Superman died, but was resurrected, and Batman was crippled, but eventually recovered).

Many comic speculators who were only in the market to see important comics mature, then sell them for a tidy profit, didn't quite understand how quick the turn around would be on the story recant, and many rushed out to scoop up as many copies of whatever issues were to be deemed significant. Comic shops received not only staggering sales during the week that Superman died,&lt;ref name="CBGXtra" /&gt; but also had to try and meet the demand. This led to the saturation of the market and the devaluing of what was thought to be the end of an American icon. Some comic book retailers and theorists deem DC's practices in the press forum and their relationship with the non-specialized consumer to be grossly negligent of the status of the market, and that their marketing campaign, whereas most likely not malicious in intent, spelled doom for the speculator market and comic sales in general. Others place the blame for the comic market crash on Marvel (whose product line had bloated to hundreds of separate titles by late 1993, including the poorly received "[[Marvel UK]]" and "[[Marvel 2099|2099]]" lines) or creator-owned upstart [[Image Comics]] (who fed the speculator feeding frenzy more than any other comics publisher).&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Industry Sales Records in 1993 Shadowed by Collapse of Speculator Boom: Image Receives Brunt of Criticism for Their Role in Market Crash," ''The Comics Journal'' #166 (February 1994), pp. 27-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other publishing houses had different problems. [[Valiant Comics]] &amp;mdash; at one point the third-largest comic book publisher &amp;mdash; was sold to the video game giant [[Acclaim Entertainment]] for $65 million in June 1994.&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Acclaim Buys Voyager for $65 Million," ''The Comics Journal'' #168 (May 1994), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Acclaim renamed the line Acclaim Comics in 1996. Their primary motivation was to make the properties more suitable for use in video game development. Eventually, Acclaim filed for bankruptcy following the collapse of its video game business. The miniseries ''[[Deathmate]]'' &amp;mdash; a crossover between [[Image Comics]] and [[Valiant Comics]] &amp;mdash; is often considered to have been the final nail in the speculation market's coffin; although heavily hyped and highly anticipated when initially solicited, the books from the Image Comics side shipped so many months late that reader interest disappeared by the time the series finally materialized, leaving some retailers holding literally hundreds of unsellable copies of the various ''Deathmate'' books.&lt;ref&gt;Deppey, Dirk.

===Post-bubble speculation===
Since 1997, comic book sales have fallen to a fraction of early-1990s levels, with print runs of many popular titles down as much as 90% from their peaks. Currently, most of the hype generated around the major companies' comics involves changes to the characters, well-known creators writing or illustrating a title, and buzz surrounding an adaptation to another medium such as film or television.

The one remaining bastion for comic speculation remains in online auction sites such as [[eBay]]; but even there, comic books remain a buyer's market. In the 2000s, prices for genuinely rare near-mint comics rose steadily, doubling in some cases. This was aided in part by newly established comic book [[Third party grading|grading]] companies, such as [[Comic Guaranty LLC]] (CGC) and Professional Grading eXperts LLC (PGX). Improved accountability has increased collector confidence, although some collectors have complained that the market has once again become more about speculation, instead of being focused on the art and stories.&lt;ref name = "Bang"&gt;{{Cite news| first = Conor| last = Dougherty | title = Bang!

Until February 2002, the highest price paid for a comic book was $350,000 for ''Marvel Comics'' #1, bought by Jay Parrino (USA) in November 2001.  The sale of a CGC-graded 8.0 "very fine" issue of ''Action Comics'' #1 reportedly sold between an undisclosed buyer and seller on the comic book online auction site "Comic Connect" for $1,000,000 topped the list&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Phillips, J. (2010, February 22). "Hero Complex", ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; for a few days. It was quickly eclipsed by a CGC-graded 8.0 Very Fine ''Detective'' #27 (the first Batman comic book) at [[Heritage Auctions]], which realized $1,075,500.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ha.com/pr-1802 "$1-million-plus Batman comic leads Guinness World Record-breaking $5.6 million comics auction at Heritage," (press release)] Heritage Auctions (Mar. 3, 2010). Accessed March 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, another ''Action Comics'' #1, a CGC-graded 8.5 was reportedly sold between an undisclosed buyer and seller on "Comics Connect" for $1.5 million, thus setting the current record for the highest sum ever paid for a comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rare comic of Superman debut fetches $1.5 million|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-03-30/entertainment/superman.comic_1_action-comics-comic-book-superman-book?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|accessdate=10 August 2011|newspaper=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation of comics==
To preserve comics, which are a printed medium, it is prescribed that they be stored in cool, dark places, as sunlight can [[bleaching|bleach]] the pages, and heat and moisture can also damage them. Sunlight can also react with the [[paper]], causing it to "yellow", as well as having a bleaching effect on the [[inks]] used within the comic. Some [[Collecting|collectors]] advise against storing comics in cardboard boxes, or using backing boards, as these are both sources of [[acid]] which can react with the fibers of the paper of comics, eventually destroying a comic. If these products are used to store comics, these collectors advise using products marked as acid free.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]], [[polyethylene]] or [[polypropylene]] storage bags are popular, and allow a comic to be "bagged" in a contained environment, and have become the traditional way of storing comics. Some comic shops now sell comics already in bags, although the quality of the bag can vary. These types of bags are not considered "archival safe" because various plastic compositions may contain elements or have other properties that could harm the comic in years to come. Mylars are the only bags available that are archival safe. Corrugated plastic boxes, preferred by some collectors, offer greater protection against acid while also offering better protection against moisture damage and vermin damage.

Original art, typically 11x17 [[bristol board]]s with the pencils and ink, can be protected against direct sunlight as well as acid deterioration by using an archival quality [[picture frame|frame]] coupled with glass which has been treated to protect against [[ultraviolet]] rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Collection Protection - For Comics | work=Bags Unlimited | url=http://www.savemycomics.com/ | accessdate=June 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Comic Book Collecting - A Beginner's Guide | work=TCBulk.com | url=http://www.tcbulk.com/scripts/HobbyCorner.asp | accessdate=August 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the column ''Comic Book Vitamins''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectfanboy.com/vb/showthread.php?p=2597#post2597 Project Fanboy Column: Comic Book Vitamins]&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Project Fanboy]] website, Steven Sykora discussed preserving collections by submitting your comic books to the [[Comics Guaranty LLC|CGC]], where comics are inspected for flaws, graded accordingly and placed in an inner well - a sealed sleeve of Barex, a highly gas-impermeable plastic polymer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ineosbarex.com/ INEOS Barex] - Barex manufacturer's website.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the comics are sealed through a combination of compression and ultrasonic vibration in a transparent, hard plastic capsule. This process is often referred to in slang as "slabbing" and there is debate as to whether this provides better protection for your comic books than an acid-free backing board and Mylar sleeve.

Storing a comic as a computer file (scanning and saving the comic as a comic book file or .cbz/.cbr) is also an option, allowing those without access to the comic itself a chance to see at the least the story for themselves. However, as with other digital means of storing media, this also allows for the possibility of [[copyright infringement]] via unauthorized digital distribution, such as peer-to-peer [[file sharing]] networks.

=== Subscription crease ===
A subscription crease describes a specific flaw in the condition of a comic book, particularly a crease through the entire book running from top to bottom. It is a term commonly used by comic book collectors. When comic book publishers began mailing comics directly to monthly subscribers they would simply fold the comic in half and stuff it into a standard #10 business envelope. This method was expedient and cost effective - the comic book business survived on razor thin margins - but resulted in a clearly visible line running from top to bottom of your favorite comic. The "memory" factor inherent in [[paper]] assured that this crease would be visible forever. Consequently, [[Collecting|collectors]], who prize condition, consider this a defect that lowers the desirability of a particular issue. This practice faded away in the early 1970s when publishers found a [[marketing]] opportunity in mailing comics in larger envelopes, unfolded. Hence the appearance of in-issue ads touting that monthly comics were "Mailed flat!"{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Related collecting==
{{Main|Comic book original art collecting}}
[[Comic book original art collecting|Collecting original art]] is the collecting of the artists' production pencils and inks used in the creation of comic books. Unlike mass-produced comic books, there is only one piece of original art for each individual comic book page or cover.

==List of comic collections==
Many private collections of comics exist, and they have also started to find their way onto the shelves of public libraries. [[Museums]] and [[University|universities]] with notable collections of comics include:
* [[Allen and John Saunders Collection]] at Bowling Green State University's Popular Culture Library.
* [[British Comics Collection]] at The British Library.
* [[Comic art collection]] of Michigan State University.
* [[Comic Book Research Guide]] of The New York Public Library.
* The Comics Collection, including the Sol Davidson Collection at the University of Florida.
* [[Cartoon Research Library]] of Ohio State University
* [[CartoonHub]], the website of the British Cartoon Archive, University of Kent
* [[James Cabell Library]] at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] (VCU) in [[Richmond, Virginia]]
* The [[United States Library of Congress]] holds many collections of comic strips, comic books and periodicals.

==Comic collectors==
Comic collectors are people who collect comics or comic books. Many comic readers keep their comics for an indefinite period and have large accumulations, but a true collector differs in enthusiasm and degree; collectors will generally at least seek past issues rather than being content to read what new comics come along.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

As comic book characters become more mainstream through adaptations in other media (primarily television and film), a number of notable people have professed to be comic book collectors, such as:
*Actor [[Nicolas Cage]], who changed his original last name of Coppola (part of an extended family working in film, including his uncle [[Francis Ford Coppola]]) to the [[stage name]] "Cage", based on the Marvel Comics character [[Luke Cage]], to avoid the appearance of [[nepotism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rd.com/content/openContent.do?contentId=28200 Nicolas Cage Interview: A Fork in the Road]&lt;/ref&gt; when he entered the film industry.  A longtime comics fan, Cage amassed an impressive collection over the years, but in October 2002, he auctioned off most of his collection for combined proceeds of over $1.68 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ha.com/c/press-release.zx?releaseId=271 Guinness Record $5.2 million Comics Auction: First part of Nicolas Cage Comic Collection Goes for $1.68 Million]&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Heritage Auctions]]. Heritage sold Nicolas Cage's remaining comics privately over the next year for approximately another $325,000, and in 2009 they also auctioned part of Cage's Movie Poster collection. Cage also starred the 2007 film ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'' and its 2012 sequel ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]''.
*Actor [[Ben Affleck]], who has named ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' as his favorite comic from his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan J. Downey (24 June 2002). "[http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1455368/20020621/story.jhtml Affleck, Garner Open Up About 'Daredevil']". [[MTV]]. Accessed 21 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Affleck played that series' title character in the [[Daredevil (film)|2003 film of the same name]], and has been cast as [[Batman]] in [[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]: a sequel to the 2013 Superman film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''.
*Writer, director and actor [[Kevin Smith]], whose love for comics has been reflected in much of his film work in the so-called "[[View Askewniverse]]", particularly the film ''[[Mallrats]]''.  Smith has also written stories for comics published by Marvel and DC; as a nod to his work on the ''Daredevil'' comic, he had a cameo in the film adaptation as a morgue worker.
*Actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] is a reader and collector well into middle age, stating as recently as a July 2006 interview that he was reading currently published comic books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Walters|first=Mark|title=SAMUEL L.

*British TV and radio presenter [[Jonathan Ross]] is a long time collector of comic books.

'''Common Projects''' is an American-Italian [[luxury goods|luxury]] footwear company.

==History==
The company was founded in 2004 by Prathan Poopat, an American-based [[art director]], and Flavio Girolami, an Italian [[creative consultant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Fashion Sneakers: The Runaway Hit |first=John |last=Ortved |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=13 December 2013 |accessdate=2014-09-05 |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303293604579256710942287716}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Common Ground: A Conversation With Prathan Poopat And Flavio Girolami |work=The Line |accessdate=2014-09-05 |url=https://www.theline.com/shop/feature/a_conversation_with_prathan_poopat_and_flavio_girolami}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Common Projects Makes More New Classics for Fall '14 |first=Noah |last=Johnson  |publisher=[[Style.com]] |date=2014-07-31 |accessdate=2014-09-05 |url=http://www.style.com/trends/industry/2014/common-projects-sneakers-fall-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=At Men’s Fashion Weeks, White Sneakers Appear On and Off the Runways |last=Schneier |first=Matthew |work=[[New York Times]] |date=25 June 2014 |accessdate=2014-09-05 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/fashion/at-mens-fashion-weeks-white-sneakers-appear-on-and-off-the-runways.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shoes are [[made in Italy|hand-stitched in Italy]], and often use Italian [[Nappa leather]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title="Asked and Answered &amp;#124; Common Projects" |last=Xu |first=Bifen |work=[[T: The New York Times Style Magazine]] |date=2 October 2009 |accessdate=2014-09-05 |url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/asked-and-answered-common-projects}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Common Projects - The Perfect Sneaker |work=[[Sneaker Freaker]] |date=2008-09-16 |accessdate=2014-09-05 |url=http://www.sneakerfreaker.com/articles/common-projects-the-perfect-sneaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2626">'''Czechization''' ({{lang-cs|čechizace, počeštění}}; {{lang-de|Tschechisierung}}) is a cultural change in which something ethnically non-[[Czech people|Czech]] is made to become Czech. 

This concept is especially relevant in relation to the [[Germans]] of [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Czech Silesia]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} as well as the [[Poles]] of [[Zaolzie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Nowak| first = Krzysztof| title = Śląsk Cieszyński.

== Czechization involving Germany/Germans ==
With the [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|expulsion of the majority of Germans]] and the partial resettlement of previously German speaking parts of Czechoslovakia by Czechs, these territories became czechized after World War II. 

"In June 1905, the German language paper ''Bohemia'' of Prague reported czechization in Saxony, Germany after a great influx of Czech workers had czechified the town of [[Ostritz]].&lt;ref name=Murdock&gt;{{cite book|last=Murdock|first=Caitlin|title=Changing Places: Society, Culture, and Territory in the Saxon-Bohemian Borderlands, 1870-1946|year=2010|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=978-0-472-11722-2|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Saxon officials the reports were greatly exaggerated.&lt;ref name=Murdock/&gt; They conceded that while Czech speakers in Saxon communities were fewer than popularly supposed, they were nevertheless worth watching."&lt;ref name=Murdock/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Dogs'''''|狗-DOGS-|Ku -Dogs-|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series by [[Shirow Miwa]]. The first manga of the series was published in 2001 as '''''Dogs: Stray Dogs Howling in the Dark''''' ('''''Dogs: Prelude''''' in the English version published by [[Viz Media]]). In 2005, a manga sequel began serialization in the manga magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' as '''''Dogs: Bullets &amp; Carnage''''', continuing the storyline. The ''Dogs: Prelude'' manga volume has been adapted into a two-volume [[OVA|original video animation]] series (OVA) by [[David Production]] in 2009.

==Premise==
{{expand section|date=February 2012}}
{{main|List of Dogs: Bullets &amp; Carnage characters}}
''Dogs'' is set in a [[dystopic]] European city where violence, crime, [[genetic manipulation]] and other scientific brutalities have become common. The story focuses on four [[antihero]] [[protagonist]]s who, through a series of coincidences, meet as they search for a way down to "the Below", looking for answers to their individual pasts.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Media==

===Manga===
{{main|List of Dogs: Bullets &amp; Carnage chapters}}
The series originally began with {{nihongo|''Dogs: Stray Dogs Howling in the Dark''|グッドドッグ・ステイ|Guddo Doggu: Sutei|lit. "Good Dog: Stay"}}: a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] manga that serves as prequel to the main series, {{nihongo|''Dogs: Bullets &amp; Carnage''|ドッグス: バレッツ&amp;カーネイジ |Doggusu: Barettsu Ando Kāneiji}}. The ''Stray Dogs'' manga introduces the four main characters and the majority of the support characters, in four chapters that are largely independent of each other. The storyline presented in ''Dogs: Bullets &amp; Carnage'' continues the adventures of the four main characters. Publication of the series took a short hiatus and resumed in the March 2010 issue of ''Ultra Jump''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-01-19/shaman-king/ultimo-takei-to-restart-jumbor-manga|title=Shaman King/Ultimo's Takei to Restart Jumbor Manga|date=January 19, 2010|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A one-shot called ''Dogs: Hardcore Twins'' introduces the characters Luki and Noki, a pair of twin sisters sent out to capture a former local gang-boss. Another one-shot called ''M.M.M. Works Annex Featuring Badō Nails'' details a brief glimpse into Badou's past.{{cn|date=March 2014}}

In July 2008, [[Viz Media]] announced that it had licensed the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-07-25/viz-media-picks-up-miwa-dogs-mase-ikigami-manga|title=Viz Media Picks Up Miwa's ''Dogs'', Mase's ''Ikigami'' Manga|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 25, 2008|accessdate=August 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Releases began in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/viz-media-previews-new-manga-series-for-2009_article_86663.html|title=Viz Media Previews New Manga Series for 2009|date=August 5, 2008|accessdate=August 6, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/672aYcEbI?url=http://www.mania.com/viz-media-previews-new-manga-series-for-2009_article_86663.html|archivedate=April 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama CD===
The original ''Dogs: Stray Dogs Howling into the Dark'' volume was adapted into a [[drama CD]] released in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-901157-7&amp;mode=1|title=DOGS ドラマCD|publisher=Booknavi|accessdate=August 7, 2008|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second drama CD was released on October 23, 2010, adapting the first volume of ''Dogs: Bullets &amp; Carnage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-901165-2|title= DOGS ドラマCD 2 |publisher=Booknavi|accessdate=March 2, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anime===
On November 19, 2008, an OVA adaptation of ''Dogs: Stray Dogs Howling in the Dark'' was announced in ''Ultra Jump''. The two-volume OVA series was produced by [[David Production]] and featured the same voice cast as the drama CD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-11-19/miwa-dogs-action-manga-to-be-animated|title=Miwa's Dogs Action Manga to Be Animated (Updated)|publisher=AnimeNewsNetwork|accessdate=November 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first DVD volume, released on May 19, 2009 with the fourth volume of ''Dogs: Bullets &amp; Carnage'', featured adaptations of the first two chapters, "Weepy Old Killer" and "Gun Smoker". The second DVD volume, featuring "Blade Maiden" and "Stray Dogs Howling in the Dark", was initially released on May 29, 2009, for a limited time and later released on July 17, 2009 along with a limited edition reissue of the first ''Dogs'' manga which included new story material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-12-10/dogs-anime-dvd-project-to-be-2-volumes-long|title=Dogs Anime DVD Project to Be 2 Volumes Long (Updated)|date=December 10, 2008|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=March 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Carlo Santos of [[Anime News Network]] stated that Shirow Miwa raised "gunplay to the level of art" and that the loosely connected characters "provide the backdrop for mouth-watering eye candy". He also states that the "bent-perspective and striking layouts" will dazzle the reader "with split-second [[bullet-time]] acrobats". The most striking aspect is how the sparse backgrounds and lack of special effects make each scene more effective because the critical moments have a "frozen in time" quality more effective than a comic book's attempt to capture motion in a still frame. Santos also credits Miwa's ability to "craft a manga storyline about an old man who's the very opposite of a spunky teenage protagonist". However, Santos believes it is another "pompous, preening '_____ with guns' series" and that it is hard to find any substance of artistry when the Miwa is "cycling through all the usual tough-guy tropes". The characters fall into [[clichés]] and the entire series is "cliché city". He believes that the stories are too loosely connected. Even though the characters encounter each other eventually, it is "not the same thing as actually kicking off a storyline together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/right-turn-only/2009-04-28|title=MmmBobobop - RIGHT TURN ONLY!!|last=Santos|first=Carlo|date=2009-04-28|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin stated the volume is "a stylishly violent crime thriller in the vein of Asian film-influenced movies like ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' and ''[[The Matrix (series)|The Matrix]]''" and that Miwa's art reflects the elegance such a manga needs. He thought that the characters dress well and that most of characters "sport top of the line hair styles". The series is not empty either. Douresseaux called the series "visually sharp" and said that it bears some weight behind each swing. He believes that [[Garth Ennis]] fans and fans of violent anime will like the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookbin.com/dogsprelude001.html|title=Dogs: Prelude Volume 0|last=Douresseaux|first=Leroy|date=2009-04-13|publisher=Comic Book Bin|accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manga Recon's Ken Haley stated that although all four stories in the volume were enjoyable and entertaining, the fourth story involving Heine "feels cut off and adrift from the other three" because it incorporated [[science fiction]] elements the other three did not hint at. He felt that Miwa's artwork is engaging and the characters designs are interesting and "contemporary with a vague hint of [[Industrial music|industrial]]/[[Goth subculture|goth]] at times". Miwa's use of heavy blacks and stark whites reminded Haley of [[Shou Tajima]], illustrator of ''[[Multiple Personality Detective Psycho]]'', although there is no further similarity. He says that Miwa's style is dynamic and the action sequences are "fast-paced and kinetic" because of liberal use of extreme depth cues, an artistic technique which exaggerates the sense of distance. However, the technique does seem a bit overused as it is used in every action sequence, causing it to lose impact. Haley does entertain the idea Miwa used the technique in a [[Satire|satirical]] manner and, if so, "it worked". He praises the lack of backgrounds as they give the stories a "universal feeling" and allows them to be set in any modern-day city. However, the lack of backgrounds means that important setting information needs to be expressed through dialogue. Despite this, Haley is curious to see what will happen next and how the plots will connect to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popcultureshock.com/manga/index.php/reviews/manga-reviews/dogs-prelude-vol-0/ |title=Dogs: Prelude Volume 0 |last=Haley |first=Ken |date=2009-04-17 |work=Manga Recon |publisher=PopCultureShock |accessdate=2009-04-28 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qwQ7lQTi?url=http://www.popcultureshock.com/manga/index.php/reviews/manga-reviews/dogs-prelude-vol-0/ |archivedate=July 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Farinata''' {{IPA-it|fariˈnaːta|}}, '''socca''' {{IPA-it|ˈsɔkka|}}, '''torta di ceci''' {{IPA-it|ˈtorta di ˈtʃeːtʃi|}}, or '''cecina''' {{IPA-it|tʃeˈtʃiːna|}} is a type of thin, unleavened [[pancake]] or [[crêpe]] of [[chickpea flour]] originating in [[Genoa]] and later a typical food of the [[Ligurian Sea]] coast, from [[Nice, France|Nice]] to [[Elba]] island.

==History==
The origin of the dish is unknown, although various flat-bread techniques predate written history, as do chickpeas, and presumably chickpea flour. One origin-story says ''farinata'' was invented by a group of Roman soldiers who roasted chickpea-flour on a shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSSICwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35 |title=Liguria |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |author=Rosie Whitehouse |year=2016 |page=35 |accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
In standard Italian, the dish is called ''farinata'' ("made of flour") while in [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], specifically in the [[Genoese dialect]], it goes by the name of '''fainâ''' {{IPA-it|faiˈna|}}. In Nice and the [[Côte d'Azur]], it is called ''socca'', in [[Tuscany]], ''cecina'' ("made of chickpeas") or ''torta di ceci'' ("chickpea pie") and in Sardinia fainè. In [[Uruguay]]
and [[Argentina]] it is massively popular and is called [[fainá]].

==Cooking method==
It is made by stirring [[chickpea flour]] into a mixture of [[water]] and [[olive oil]] to form a loose [[batter (cooking)|batter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/14/chickpea-flour-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi |title=Sheer poetry: Yotam Ottolenghi's chickpea flour recipes, from farinata to chickpea pancakes |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 November 2014  |author=[[Yotam Ottolenghi]] |accessdate= 4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; pouring it into a pan to make a pancake typically 4mm thick, and baking it for a few minutes, traditionally in an open oven in a tin-plated copper baking-pan. Farinata may be seasoned with fresh [[rosemary]], [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[sea salt]]. Traditionally farinata is cut into irregularly shaped triangular slices, and eaten (with no toppings) on small plates with optional black pepper. Elsewhere in Italy - traditionally in Tuscany, where it is called ''cecina'' (from the Italian word for chickpea, ''ceci'') - it is served stuffed into small [[focaccia]] (mainly in [[Pisa]]) or between two slices of bread, as it is traditional in [[Livorno]]. It is sold in pizzerias and bakeries.

==Italian variations==
On the [[Tuscany|Tuscan coast]], south of Liguria, especially in the province of [[Pisa]], [[Livorno]], [[Lucca]], [[Massa Carrara]] ''cecina'' or, in [[Livorno]], ''torta (di ceci)'' is baked (with no rosemary used for toppings).

In [[Sassari]], [[Sardinia]], due to the historical ties with Genoa, la '''fainé genovese''' (''genoese fainé''), is a typical dish.

In [[Savona]] province (near Genoa), a version of farinata called ''farinata bianca'' (white farinata) is used. It is made with wheat flour instead of chickpea flour.

The name [[panissa]] or paniscia in [[Genoese dialect|Genoese]] indicates a solidified boiled [[polenta]]-like paste, made with the same ingredients as farinata. It can be cut into strips and fried, called ''panissette''.

In Genoa, variants of the farinata include sometimes onions or artichokes, but the most famous derivative recipe is the ''fainâ co i gianchetti'' ("farinata with whitebait"), at times hard to find due to fishing regulations, but traditionally seen as the quintessential fainâ.

==French variations==
[[File:Socca in Nice.jpg|thumb|''Socca'' of [[Nice]] also known as ''La Cade'' in [[Toulon]]]]
[[Image:Socca a Nice.jpg|thumb|right|Socca, just coming out of the oven, in the old town of Nice, on the French Riviera]]
[[Image:Socca slices Nice.jpg|thumb|right|Slices of socca at a Nice market]]
*''Socca'' is also a specialty of southeastern French cuisine, particularly in and around the city of [[Nice]], and is the same as farinata. It may be baked on a tinned copper plate more than a meter in diameter.
*''Panisse'' is a specialty of [[Marseille]], and is a similar dish, but thicker, and is typically cut into rectangles and fried.

==Elsewhere==
In [[Algeria]], '''karantita''' is a similar dish which is very popular.

In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] (where many thousands of Ligurian people emigrated between the 19th and the 20th centuries) farinata is known as '''fainá''', similar to the original Genoese name ''fainâ''. It is often eaten on top of pizza (''a caballo'').

In Uruguay, "el fainá" (called "la fainá" in Argentina) is considered a traditional Uruguayan dish, brought by immigrants in 1915, so much so that 27 August has been called "Fainá Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montevideo.com.uy/auc.aspx?67157 |title=El Fainá cumple 93 Años en Uruguay.

In [[Gibraltar]], where a significant portion of its population is of [[History of the Genoese in Gibraltar|Genoese origin]], it is known as '''[[Gibraltarian cuisine#Calentita|calentita]]''' when it is baked or '''[[Gibraltarian cuisine#Panissa|panissa]]''' when it is fried. They are typically eaten plain, without any toppings. These are considered to be Gibraltar's [[national dish]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://italianfood.about.com/od/chickpeaslentils/r/blr0714.htm|title=Ligurian Chickpea Pancake Recipe (Farinata)|work=The Spruce|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the dal (the word for [[pulses]]) "chila" (pronounced "cheela") or besan (the word for chickpea flour) "puda" (pronounced "poora"), depending on the region, is a similar dish made by cooking chickpea (or another pulse) flour and water on an oiled skillet. Vegetables such as onions, green chillies, cabbage and herbs and spices such as coriander are also added in certain versions of the preparation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34612">A '''foreign language writing aid''' is a [[computer program]] or any other instrument that assists a non-native language user (also referred to as a foreign language learner) in writing decently in their target language. Assistive operations can be classified into two categories: on-the-fly prompts and post-writing checks. Assisted aspects of writing include: [[lexicon|lexical]], [[syntax|syntactic]] (syntactic and semantic roles of a word's frame), [[lexical semantic]] (context/collocation-influenced word choice and user-intention-driven [[synonym]] choice) and [[idiomatic]] expression transfer, etc. Different types of [[foreign language]] writing aids include automated proofreading applications, [[text corpora]], [[dictionaries]], [[translation]] aids and [[orthography]] aids.

==Background==
The four major components in the acquisition of a language are namely; [[listening]], [[speaking]], [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[writing]].&lt;ref name=Gregersen&gt;Gregersen, T.S. (2003) To Err Is Human: A Reminder to Teachers of Language-Anxious Students. ''Foreign Language Annals, 36''(1): 25-32.&lt;/ref&gt; While most people have no difficulties in exercising these skills in their native language, doing so in a second or foreign language is not that easy. In the area of writing, research has found that foreign language learners find it painstaking to compose in the target language, producing less eloquent sentences and encountering difficulties in the revisions of their written work. However, these difficulties are not attributed to their linguistic abilities.&lt;ref name=Chih&gt;Chih, H. K. (2008). Designing an Online Writing System: Learning with Support. ''ELC Journal, 39''(3), 285-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many language learners experience [[foreign language anxiety]], feelings of apprehensiveness and nervousness, when learning a second language.&lt;ref name=Gregersen/&gt; In the case of writing in a foreign language, this anxiety can be alleviated via foreign language writing aids as they assist non-native language users in independently producing decent written work at their own pace, hence increasing confidence about themselves and their own learning abilities.&lt;ref name=Behjat&gt;Behjat, F. (2011). Teacher Correction or Word Processors: Which Is a Better Option for the Improvement of EFL Students' Writing Skill?. ''Journal of Language Teaching &amp; Research, 2''(6), 1430-1434.&lt;/ref&gt;

With advancements in technology, aids in foreign language writing are no longer restricted to traditional mediums such as teacher feedback and dictionaries. Known as [[computer-assisted language learning]] (CALL), use of computers in language classrooms has become more common, and one example would be the use of [[word processors]] to assist learners of a foreign language in the technical aspects of their writing, such as [[grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, K. (1990). [https://books.google.com/books?id=KKetQ6wsGBAC&amp;pg=PA10 ''Computer assisted language learning:program structure and principles'']. (pp. 10). Intellect Books. Retrieved 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison with correction feedback from the teacher, the use of word processors is found to be a better tool in improving the writing skills of students who are learning [[English as a Foreign Language]] (EFL), possibly because students find it more encouraging to learn their mistakes from a neutral and detached source.&lt;ref name=Behjat/&gt; Apart from learners' confidence in writing, their motivation and attitudes will also improve through the use of computers.&lt;ref name=Chih/&gt;

Foreign language learners' awareness of the conventions in writing can be improved through reference to guidelines showing the features and structure of the target genre.&lt;ref name=Chih/&gt; At the same time, interactions and feedback help to engage the learners and expedite their learning, especially with active participation.&lt;ref name= Telçeker&gt;Telçeker, H. &amp; Akcan , S. (2010). The Effect of Oral and Written Teacher Feedback on Students’ Revisions in a Process-Oriented EFL Writing Class. ''TESL Reporter, 43''(1), 31-49.&lt;/ref&gt; In online writing situations, learners are isolated without face-to-face interaction with others. Therefore, a foreign language writing aid should provide interaction and feedback so as to ease the learning process. This complements [[communicative language teaching]] (CLT); which is a teaching approach that highlights interaction as both the means and aim of learning a language.

==Automation of proofreading process==
In accordance with the simple view of writing, both lower-order and higher-order skills are required. Lower-order skills involve those of [[spelling]] and [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], whereas higher order-skills involve that of ideation; which refers to idea generation and organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Juel, C. (1988). Learning to Read and Write: A Longitudinal Study of 54 Children from First through Fourth Grades. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 80''(4), 437-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Proofreading is helpful for non-native language users in minimising errors while writing in a foreign language. [[Spell checkers]] and [[grammar checkers]] are two applications that aid in the automatic proofreading process of written work.&lt;ref name=Beekman&gt;Beekman, G. (2003). ''Computer confluence: exploring tomorrow's technology'' (Vol. 1). Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|9780130661883}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spelling check and applications===
{{Main article|Spell checker}}

To achieve writing competence in a non-native language, especially in an alphabetic language, spelling proficiency is of utmost importance.&lt;ref&gt;Puranik, C. S., Lonigan, C. J., &amp; Kim, Y. (2011). Contributions of Emergent Literacy Skills to Name Writing, Letter Writing, and Spelling in Preschool Children. ''Early Childhood Research Quarterly, 26''(4), 465–474.&lt;/ref&gt; Spelling proficiency has been identified as a good indicator of a learner’s acquisition and comprehension of alphabetic principles in the target language.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Y., Al Otaiba, S., Puranik, C., Folsom, J., Greulich, L., &amp; Wagner, R. K. (2011). Componential Skills of Beginning Writing: An Exploratory Study. ''Learning And Individual Differences, 21''(5), 517-525.&lt;/ref&gt; Documented data on misspelling patterns indicate that majority of misspellings fall under the four categories of letter insertion, deletion, transposition and substitution.&lt;ref&gt;Kukich, K. (1992). Techniques for Automatically Correcting Words in Text. ''ACM Computing Surveys, 24''(4), 376-439.&lt;/ref&gt; In languages where pronunciation of certain sequences of letters may be similar, misspellings may occur when the non-native language learner relies heavily on the sounds of the target language because they are unsure about the accurate spelling of the words.&lt;ref name=Ndiaye&gt;Ndiaye, M. (2003). A Spell Checker Tailored to Language Learners. ''Computer Assisted Language Learning, 16''(2/3), 213–232.&lt;/ref&gt; The spell checker application is a type of writing aid that non-native language learners can rely on to detect and correct their misspellings in the target language.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, T. (2008). [http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED501062.pdf ''Foreign Language Learning Difficulties and Teaching Strategies'']. (pp. 29). Master's Thesis, Dominican University of California. Retrieved 19 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Operating modes====
In general, spell checkers can operate one of two modes, the interactive spell checking mode or the batch spell checking.&lt;ref name=Beekman /&gt; In the interactive mode, the spell checker detects  and marks misspelled words with a squiggly underlining as the words are being typed. On the other hand, batch spell checking is performed on a batch-by-batch basis as the appropriate command is entered. Spell checkers, such as those used in [[Microsoft Word]], can operate in either mode.

====Evaluation====
Although spell checkers are commonplace in numerous software products, errors specifically made by learners of a target language may not be sufficiently catered for.&lt;ref&gt;L'Haire, S. (2007). FipsOrtho: A Spell Checker for Learners of French. ''Recall, 19''(2), 137–161.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because generic spell checkers function on the assumption that their users are competent speakers of the target language, whose misspellings are primarily due to accidental typographical errors.&lt;ref name=Heift&gt;Heift, T., &amp; Schulze, M. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=OUZ8s8BIpIUC&amp;pg=PA84 ''Errors and intelligence in computer-assisted language learning: parsers and pedagogues'']. (pp. 84). Routledge. Retrieved 19 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of misspellings were found to be attributed to systematic competence errors instead of accidental typographical ones, with up to 48% of these errors failing to be detected or corrected by the generic spell checker used.&lt;ref&gt;Rimrott, A., &amp; Heift, T. (2005). [http://henshu2dworld.wordpress.com/page/3/ Language Learners and Generic Spell Checkers in CALL]. ''CALICO Journal, 23''(1), 17-48. Retrieved 19 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of the deficiency of generic spell checkers, programs have been designed to gear towards non-native misspellings,&lt;ref name=Heift /&gt; such as FipsCor and Spengels. In FipsCor, a combination of methods, such as the alpha-code method, phonological reinterpretation method and morphological treatment method, has been adopted in an attempt to create a spell checker tailored to French language learners.&lt;ref name=Ndiaye /&gt; On the other hand, Spengels is a tutoring system developed to aid Dutch children and non-native Dutch writers of English in accurate English spelling.&lt;ref&gt;Bos, E., &amp; van de Plassche, J. (1994). A knowledge-based, English verb-form tutor. ''Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 5''(1), 107–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar check and applications===
{{Main article|Grammar checker}}
[[Grammar]] (syntactical and morphological) competency is another indicator of a non-native speaker’s proficiency in writing in the target language. [[Grammar checkers]] are a type of computerised application which non-native speakers can make use of to proofread their writings as such programs endeavor to identify syntactical errors.&lt;ref name=Bustamante&gt;Bustamante, F.R., &amp; León, F.S, (1996). [http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1000000/992661/p175-bustamante.pdf?ip=220.255.2.169&amp;acc=OPEN&amp;CFID=91589205&amp;CFTOKEN=38095021&amp;__acm__=1332492182_c3de2b2c34a6a2a43caa1b79d36e60ea GramCheck: a grammar and style checker]. ''Proceedings of the 16th conference on Computational linguistics'', August 05–09, Copenhagen, Denmark. Retrieved 19 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Grammar and style checking is recognized as one of the seven major applications of [[Natural Language Processing]] and every project in this field aims to build grammar checkers into a writing aid instead of a robust man-machine interface.&lt;ref name=Bustamante/&gt;

====Evaluation====
Currently, grammar checkers are incapable of inspecting the linguistic or even syntactic correctness of text as a whole. They are restricted in their usefulness in that they are only able to check a small fraction of all the possible syntactic structures. Grammar checkers are unable to detect semantic errors in a correctly structured syntax order; i.e. grammar checkers do not register the error when the sentence structure is syntactically correct but semantically meaningless.&lt;ref name=Arppe&gt;Arppe, A. (2000). Developing a grammar checker for Swedish. ''In Proc. 12th Nordic Conference in Computational Linguistics'', Nodalida-99. Trondheim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although grammar checkers have largely been concentrated on ensuring grammatical writing, majority of them are modelled after native writers, neglecting the needs of non-native language users.&lt;ref name=Knutsson&gt;Knutsson, O., Cerratto Pargman, T. and Severinson Eklundh, T. (2003). [http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1120000/1118900/p38-knutsson.pdf?ip=220.255.2.113&amp;acc=OPEN&amp;CFID=91573695&amp;CFTOKEN=79841380&amp;__acm__=1332492380_ecaced9af203a5e1100bcd73063881bf Transforming Grammar Checking Technology into a Learning Environment for Second Language Writing]. In ''Proc. HLT/NAACL 2003 workshop: Building Educational Applications Using NLP'', (pp. 38–45). Edmonton, Canada. Retrieved 19 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Much research have attempted to tailor grammar checkers to the needs of non-native language users. Granska, a Swedish grammar checker, has been greatly worked upon by numerous researchers in the investigation of grammar checking properties for foreign language learners.&lt;ref name=Knutsson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eeg-Olofsson, J. and Knutsson, O. (2003). [https://www.nada.kth.se/theory/projects/xcheck/rapporter/eegolofsson_knutsson03.pdf Automatic grammar checking for second language learners - the use of prepositions]. In ''Nodalida-03'', Reykjavik, Iceland.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia]] has a computerised grammar checker for native Spanish speakers of EFL to help identify and correct grammatical mistakes without feedback from teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Lawley, J. (2004). A Preliminary Report on a New Grammar Checker to Help Students of English as a Foreign Language. ''Arts and Humanities in Higher Education 3''(3), 331-342&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dichotomy between spell and grammar checkers===
Theoretically, the functions of a conventional spell checker can be incorporated into a grammar checker entirely and this is likely the route that the language processing industry is working towards.&lt;ref name=Arppe /&gt; In reality, internationally available word processors such as Microsoft Word have difficulties combining spell checkers and grammar checkers due to licensing issues; various proofing instrument mechanisms for a certain language would have been licensed under different providers at different times.&lt;ref name=Arppe /&gt;

==Corpora==
{{Main article|text corpora}}
Electronic corpora in the target language provide non-native language users with authentic examples of language use rather than fixed examples, which may not be reflected in daily interactions.&lt;ref name=Koo&gt;Koo, K. (2006). [http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1250&amp;context=etd&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com.sg%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DKoo%252C%2BK.%2B%25282006%2529.%2BEffects%2Bof%2BUsing%2BCorpora%2Band%2BOnline%2BReference%2BTools%2Bon%2BForeign%2BLanguage%2BWriting%253A%2BA%2BStudy%2Bof%2BKorean%2BLearners%2Bof%2BEnglish%2Bas%2Ba%2BSecond%2BLanguage.%26btnG%3DSearch%26as_sdt%3D0%252C5%26as_ylo%3D%26as_vis%3D0#search=%22Koo%2C%20K.%20%282006%29.%20Effects%20Using%20Corpora%20Online%20Reference%20Tools%20Foreign%20Language%20Writing%3A%20Study%20Korean%20Learners%20English%20as%20Second%20Language.%22 Effects of Using Corpora and Online Reference Tools on Foreign Language Writing: A Study of Korean Learners of English as a Second Language]. ''Dissertation Abstracts International, Section A: The Humanities And Social Sciences, 67''(3), 873. Retrieved 21 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The contextualised grammatical knowledge acquired by non-native language users through exposure to authentic texts in corpora allows them to grasp the manner of sentence formation in the target language, enabling effective writing.&lt;ref name=Yoon&gt;Yoon, H., &amp; Hirvela, A. (2004). [http://englishteachersplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/YoonHirvela_2004.pdf ESL Student Attitudes toward Corpus Use in L2 Writing]. ''Journal of Second Language Writing, 13''(4), 257-283. Retrieved 21 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition of lexico-grammatical patterns===
[[Concordance (publishing)|Concordance]] set up through concordancing programs of corpora allow non-native language users to conveniently grasp lexico-grammatical patterns of the target language. Collocational frequencies of words (i.e. word pairings frequencies) provide non-native language users with information about accurate grammar structures which can be used when writing in the target language.&lt;ref name=Koo /&gt; Collocational information also enable non-native language users to make clearer distinctions between words and expressions commonly regarded as synonyms. In addition, corpora information about the semantic prosody; i.e. appropriate choices of words to be used in positive and negative co-texts, is available as reference for non-native language users in writing. The corpora can also be used to check for the acceptability or syntactic "grammaticality" of their written work.&lt;ref&gt;Kaltenbock, G., &amp; Mehlmauer-Larcher, B. (2005). Computer Corpora and the Language Classroom: On the Potential and Limitations of Computer Corpora in Language Teaching. ''Recall'', 17(1), 65-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation===
A survey conducted on [[English as a Second Language]] (ESL) students revealed corpus activities to be generally well received and thought to be especially useful for learning word usage patterns and improving writing skills in the foreign language.&lt;ref name=Yoon /&gt; It was also found that students' writings became more natural after using two online corpora in a 90-minute training session.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, A. (2009). [https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/rsadler/shared/Google%20Revisions/Corpus%20Research%20Studies/Using%20online%20corpora%20to%20develop%20students'%20writing%20skills%20Alex%20Gilmore.pdf Using Online Corpora to Develop Students' Writing Skills]. ''ELT Journal, 63''(4), 363-372. Retrieved 21 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there were also suggestions to incorporate the applications of corpora into EFL writing courses in China to improve the writing skills of learners.&lt;ref&gt;Yinqing, Q., Gang, L., &amp; Jianjun, Y. (2010). The Application of Corpora in EFL Writing Course in China. ''Review Of Higher Education &amp; Self-Learning, 3''(7), 82-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dictionaries==
{{Main article|Dictionaries}}
Dictionaries of the target learning languages are commonly recommended to non-native language learners.&lt;ref&gt;East, M. (2008). ''Dictionary Use in Foreign Language Writing Exams''. John Benjamins Publishing Company. {{ISBN|9789027219831}}. Retrieved 18 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They serve as reference tools by offering definitions, phonetic spelling, word classes and sample sentences.&lt;ref name=Koo /&gt; It was found that the use of a dictionary can help learners of a foreign language write better if they know how to use them.&lt;ref name=Jacobs&gt;Jacobs, G. M. (1989). [http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED316025.pdf Dictionaries Can Help Writing--If Students Know How To Use Them]. Retrieved 18 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign language learners can make use of grammar-related information from the dictionary to select appropriate  words, check the correct spelling of a word and look up [[synonyms]] to add more variety to their writing.&lt;ref name=Jacobs/&gt; Nonetheless, learners have to be careful when using dictionaries as the lexical-semantic information contained in dictionaries might not be sufficient with regards to language production in a particular context and learners may be misled into choosing incorrect words.&lt;ref&gt;Nesi, H. (1987). [http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED346742.pdf Do Dictionaries Help Students Write?]. In: Bloor, T. &amp; Norrish, J. (eds.), ''Written Language: Paper from the Annual Meeting of the British Association for Applied Linguistics'' (pp. 85-97). London: CILT. Retrieved 18 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Presently, many notable dictionaries are available online and basic usage is usually free. These online dictionaries allow learners of a foreign language to find references for a word much faster and more conveniently than with a manual version, thus minimising the disruption to the flow of writing.&lt;ref name=Scholfield&gt;Scholfield, P. J. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Epvtt9_zab4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA279 Vocabulary reference works in foreign language learning]. In N. Schmitt &amp; M. McCarthy (Eds.), ''Vocabulary: description, acquisition, and pedagogy'' (pp. 279-302). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Retrieved 18 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Online dictionaries available can be found under the [[list of online dictionaries]].

===Different types of dictionaries===
Dictionaries come in different levels of proficiency; such as advanced, intermediate and beginner, which learners can choose accordingly to the level best suited to them. There are many different types of dictionaries available; such as thesaurus or bilingual dictionaries, which cater to the specific needs of a learner of a foreign language. In recent years, there is also specialised dictionaries for foreign language learners that employ natural language processing tools to assist in the compilations of dictionary entries by generating feedback on the vocabulary that learners use and automatically providing inflectional and/or derivational forms for referencing items in the explanations.&lt;ref name=Kaalep&gt;Kaalep, H., &amp; Mikk, J. (2008). Creating Specialised Dictionaries for Foreign Language Learners: A Case Study. ''International Journal of Lexicography, 21''(4), 369-394. Retrieved 18 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thesaurus====
The word [[thesaurus]] means 'treasury' or 'storehouse' in Greek and Latin and is used to refer to several varieties of language resources, it is most commonly known as a book that groups words in synonym clusters and related meanings.&lt;ref name=Pearsall&gt;Pearsall, J. (2002). ''The new Oxford Dictionary of English''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Its original sense of 'dictionary or encyclopedia' has been overshadowed by the emergence of the Roget-style thesaurus&lt;ref name=Pearsall/&gt; and it is considered as a writing aid as it helps writers with the selection of words.&lt;ref name=Kilgarriff&gt;Kilgarriff, A., &amp; Yallop. C. (2000). [http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2000/pdf/180.pdf What’s in a thesaurus?]. ''In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Language Resource an Evaluation'', (pp. 1371–1379). Retrieved 18 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The differences between a Roget-style thesaurus and a dictionary would be the indexing and information given; the words in thesaurus are grouped by meaning, usually without definitions, while the latter is by [[alphabetical order]] with definitions.&lt;ref name=Kilgarriff/&gt; When users are unable to find a word in a dictionary, it is usually due to the constraint of searching alphabetically by common and well-known headwords and the use of a thesaurus eliminates this issue by allowing users to search for a word through another word based on concept.&lt;ref name=Kipfer&gt;Kipfer, B. A. (2001). ''Roget's International Thesaurus, 7th Edition''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign language learners can make use of thesaurus to find near synonyms of a word to expand their vocabulary skills and add variety to their writing. Many word processors are equipped with a basic function of thesaurus, allowing learners to change a word to another similar word with ease. However, learners must be mindful that even if the words are near synonyms, they might not be suitable replacements depending on the context.&lt;ref name=Kilgarriff/&gt;

====Spelling dictionaries====
[[File:Photo of Berlitz Spell it Right Dictionary.jpg|thumb|right|Sample of a spelling dictionary taken from Berlitz Spell it Right Dictionary&lt;ref name=Maxwell/&gt;]]

Spelling dictionaries are referencing materials that specifically aid users in finding the correct spelling of a word. Unlike common dictionaries, spelling dictionaries do not typically provide definitions and other grammar-related information of the words. While typical dictionaries can be used to check or search for correct spellings, new and improved spelling dictionaries can assist users in finding the correct spelling of words even when the first alphabet is unknown or incorrect.&lt;ref name=Maxwell&gt;Maxwell, C. (2007). ''Berlitz Spell it &lt;s&gt;Write&lt;/s&gt; Right Dictionary''. Berlitz Publishing/APA Publications GmbH &amp; Co. Verlag KC.&lt;/ref&gt; This circumvents the alphabetic ordering limitations of a classic dictionary.&lt;ref name=Kipfer/&gt; These spelling dictionaries are especially useful to foreign language learners as inclusion of concise definitions and suggestions for commonly confused words help learners to choose the correct spellings of words that sound alike or are pronounced wrongly by them.&lt;ref name=Maxwell/&gt;

=====Personal spelling dictionary=====
A personal spelling dictionary, being a collection of a single learner’s regularly misspelled words, is tailored to the individual and can be expanded with new entries that the learner does not know how to spell or contracted when the learner had mastered the words.&lt;ref name= Scheuermann&gt;Scheuermann, B. &amp; Jacobs, W. R. (1994). The Personal Spelling Dictionary: An Adaptive Approach to Reducing the Spelling Hurdle in Written Language. ''Intervention in School &amp; Clinic, 29''(5), 292-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Learners also use the personal spelling dictionary more than electronic spellcheckers, and additions can be easily made to better enhance it as a learning tool as it can include things like rules for writing and proper nouns, which are not included in electronic spellcheckers.&lt;ref name= Scheuermann/&gt; Studies also suggest that personal spelling dictionaries are better tools for learners to improve their spelling as compared to trying to memorize words that are unrelated from lists or books.&lt;ref name= ScheuermanDodd&gt;Dodd, A.W. (1988). Demons, Dictionaries, and Spelling Strategies. ''English Journal, 77''(8), 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bilingual dictionaries====
{{Main article|Bilingual dictionary}}
Current research have shown that language learners utilise dictionaries predominantly to check for meanings and that [[bilingual dictionaries]] are preferred over monolingual dictionaries for these uses.&lt;ref name=Frankenberg&gt;Frankenberg-Garcia, A. (2011). Beyond L1-L2 Equivalents:Where Do Users Of English As A Foreign Language Turn For Help?. ''International Journal of Lexicography, 24''(1), 93-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Bilingual dictionaries have proved to be helpful for learners of a new language, although in general, they hold less extensive coverage of information as compared to monolingual dictionaries.&lt;ref name=Scholfield/&gt; Nonetheless, good bilingual dictionaries capitalize on the fact that they are useful for learners to integrate helpful information about commonly known errors, false friends and contrastive predicaments from the two languages.&lt;ref name=Scholfield/&gt;

Studies have shown that learners of English have benefited from the use of bilingual dictionaries on their production and comprehension of unknown words.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;Chen, Y. (2011). Studies On Bilingualized Dictionaries: The User Perspective. ''International Journal of Lexicography, 24''(2), 161-197.&lt;/ref&gt; When using bilingual dictionaries, learners also tend to read entries in both native and target languages&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt; and this helps them to map the meanings of the target word in the foreign language onto its counterpart in their native language. It was also found that the use of bilingual dictionaries improves the results of translation tasks by learners of ESL, thus showing that language learning can be enhanced with the use of bilingual dictionaries.&lt;ref name=ahmad&gt;Ahmad, A. &amp; Hafeez, M.R. (2011). Learning English through Translation – A Case for Bilingual Dictionaries. ''Languages in India, 11''(12), 83-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of bilingual dictionaries in foreign language writing tests remains a debate. Some studies support the view that the use of a dictionary in a foreign language examination increases the mean score of the test, and hence is one of the factors that influenced the decision to ban the use of dictionaries in several foreign language tests in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Tall, G., &amp; Hurman, J. (2002). Using dictionaries in modern language GCSE examinations. ''Educational Review, 54''(3), 205-217.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies, however, present that further research into the use of bilingual dictionaries during writing tests have shown that there is no significant differences in the test scores that can be attributed to the use of a dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;East M. (2007). Bilingual Dictionaries in Tests of L2 Writing Proficiency: Do They Make a Difference?. ''Language Testing, 24''(3), 331-353.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, from the perspective of foreign language learners, being able to use a bilingual dictionary during a test is reassuring and increases their confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Tall, G., &amp; Hurman, J. (2000). Using a dictionary in a written French examination: the students' experience. ''Language Learning Journal, 21''(1), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations aids==
{{Main article|Machine translation}}
There are many free translation aids online, also known as [[machine translation]] (MT) engines, such as [[Google translate]] and [[Yahoo! Babel Fish]], that allow foreign language learners to translate between their native language and the target language quickly and conveniently.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;Garcia, I. (2011). Machine translation-assisted language learning: writing for beginners. ''Computer Assisted Language Learning, 24''(5), 471-487.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the three major categories in computerised translation tools; [[computer-assisted translation]] (CAT), Terminology data banks and machine translation.  Machine translation is the most ambitious as it is designed to handle the whole process of translation entirely without the intervention of human assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Slocum, J. (1985). [http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J85/J85-1001.pdf A survey of machine translation: its history, current status, and future prospects]. ''Journal of Computational Linguistics - Special issues on machine translation, 11''(1). Retrieved 21 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that translation into the target language can be used to improve the linguistic proficiency of foreign language learners.&lt;ref name="Niño"&gt;Niño, A. (2008). Evaluating the Use of Machine Translation Post-Editing in the Foreign Language Class. ''Computer Assisted Language Learning: An International Journal, 21''(1), 29-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Machine translation aids help beginner learners of a foreign language to write more and produce better quality work in the target language; writing directly in the target language without any aid requires more effort on the learners' part, resulting in the difference in quantity and quality.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;

However, teachers advise learners against the use of machine translation aids as output from the machine translation aids are highly misleading and unreliable; producing the wrong answers most of the time.&lt;ref name=Steding&gt;Steding, S. (2009). Machine Translation in the German Classroom: Detection, Reaction, Prevention. ''Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching German, 42''(2), 178-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Over-reliance on the aids also hinder the development of learners' writing skills, and is viewed as an act of plagiarism since the language used is technically not produced by the student.&lt;ref name=Steding/&gt;

==Orthography aids==
{{Main article|Orthography}}
[[File:Hiragana Stroke Order.jpg|thumb|right|Stroke order of Japanese hiragana characters]]
[[File:Orthography Aid.png|thumb|right|Sample of a Chinese orthography practice book]]

The [[orthography]] of a language is the usage of a specific script to write a language according to a conventionalised usage.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/orthography. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One’s ability to read in a language is further enhanced by a concurrent learning of writing.&lt;ref name=Hildreth&gt;Hildreth, G. (1963) Early Writing as an Aid to Reading. ''Education Digest, 28''(7), 42-44&lt;/ref&gt; This is because writing is a means of helping the language learner recognise and remember the features of the orthography, which is particularly helpful when the orthography has irregular phonetic-to-spelling mapping.&lt;ref name=Hildreth/&gt; This, in turn, helps the language learner to focus on the components which make up the word.&lt;ref name=Hildreth/&gt;

===Online===
Online orthography aids&lt;ref&gt;http://japanese.about.com/library/blkanji1.htm. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; provide language learners with a step-by-step process on learning how to write characters. These are especially useful for learners of languages with [[logographic]] writing systems, such as Chinese or Japanese, in which the ordering of strokes for characters are important. Alternatively, tools like [[Skritter]] provide an interactive way of learning via a system similar to writing tablets&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skritter.com/learn_more. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; albeit on computers, at the same time providing feedback on stroke ordering and progress.

Handwriting recognition is supported on certain programs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biderworld.com/penplus.asp&lt;/ref&gt; which help language learners in learning the orthography of the target language. Practice of orthography is also available in many applications, with tracing systems in place to help learners with stroke orders.&lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/word-tracer-learn-chinese/id430413408?mt=8. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offline===
Apart from  online orthography programs, offline orthography aids for language learners of logographic languages are also available. Character cards, which contain lists of frequently used characters of the target language, serve as a portable form of visual writing aid for language learners of logographic languages who may face difficulties in recalling the writing of certain characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The TiBi Card: A Writing Aid|url=http://themandarincenter.org/materials/tibi-card-writing-aid|publisher=Mandrain Institute|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation===
Studies have shown that tracing logographic characters improves the word recognition abilities of foreign language learners, as well as their ability to map the meanings onto the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bounds|first=Gwendolyn|title=How Handwriting Trains the Brain|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, does not improve their ability to link pronunciation with characters, which suggests that these learners need more than orthography aids to help them in mastering the language in both writing and speech.&lt;ref&gt;Guan, C.Q., Liu, Y., Chan, D.

'''''Giant, or Waiting for the Thursday Boat''''' is a children's book by Canadian author [[Robert Munsch]] and illustrated by [[Gilles Tibo]], first published in 1989 by Annick Press. Due to depictions of the Judeo-Christian God as a little African-American girl, as well as threats of violence against God by the titular Giant, it was challenged or removed from school libraries in Canada.

==Plot==
McKeon, the last Giant in [[Ireland]], is upset at [[Saint Patrick]] driving out not only the snakes, but also elves, giants, and all the other mythical creatures. In retaliation, McKeon begins throwing church bells into the ocean. Saint Patrick, upset, tells McKeon to take up his issue with God who will be arriving "on the Thursday boat". McKeon sits down to wait, but the first craft that arrives is a small boat carrying a little girl. Deciding that this cannot be God, McKeon invites her to sit with him as he waits. Other boats arrive, but none of them are carrying God. Upset, he takes the little girl and leaps straight into Heaven. There, he confronts Saint Patrick and the two go searching for God to settle the dispute. Eventually the little girl reveals herself as the Almighty, and states that inside her house there is more than enough room for "giants, elves, snakes, saints, and church bells."

==Reception==
Although the book has received a reevaluation by modern readers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giant: Or, Waiting for the Thursday Boat Reviews|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2885381-the-giant-or-waiting-for-the-thursday-boat#other_reviews|website=Goodreads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics at the time of publication were less kind, with Judith Saltman putting it bluntly "This is not one of [Munsch's] better books."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Janet|title=Giant Problem - What is a Kid's Book Anyway?|url=https://www.umanitoba.ca/cm/cmarchive/vol18no3/giantproblem.html|website=University of Manitoba CM Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Shortly after the book's publication, several school districts in Ontario, Canada banned the book for use in grades K-3 citing the religious themes, particularly that God was represented as a little girl,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; as well as McKeon's threats of violence towards God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Munsch, Munsch, Munsch|url=http://pelhamlibrary.blogspot.ca/2006/07/munsch-munsch-munsch.html|website=Fahrenheit 451: Freedom to Read}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of early 2016, Giant is not currently listed as a challenged book in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Challenged Works List|url=http://www.freedomtoread.ca/challenged-works/|website=FreedomToRead.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humane education''' is usually defined as the use of education to nurture compassion and respect for living beings.&lt;ref name = "Unti &amp; DeRosa, 2003"&gt;Unti, B. &amp; DeRosa, B. (2003). Humane education: Past, present, and future. In D. J. Salem &amp; A. N. Rowam (Eds.), ''The State of the Animals II: 2003'' (pp. 27 – 50). Washington, D.C.: Humane Society Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faver, C. A. (2010). School-based humane education as a strategy to prevent violence: Review and recommendations. ''Children &amp; Youth Services Review'', ''32'', 365 – 370.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a traditional focus on the treatment of non-human animals, humane education also increasingly contains content related to the environment, the compassionate treatment of other people, and the interconnectedness of issues pertaining to people and the planet.&lt;ref name = "Burnett, 2000"&gt;Burnett, C. (2000). Humane education. ''Animals Today'', ''8'', 18 - 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Humane education as a discrete field of education was created in the late 1800s by individuals like [[George Angell]] as an attempt to prevent cruelty to animals before it started&lt;ref name = "Preston, 1928"&gt;Preston, H. C. (1928). Milestones in humane education. ''Journal of Education'', ''107'', 181.&lt;/ref&gt; along with the formation of SPCAs, such as the [[MSPCA-Angell|Massachusetts SCPA]] and the [[ASPCA]]. The formation of humane education and animal protection/welfare organizations was associated with the expansion of [[women’s suffrage]] and the [[temperance movement]], and many of those involved in creation and early advocacy of humane education also worked in those other areas of social change as well.&lt;ref name = "Burnett, 2000" /&gt; These early activists successfully advocated for the passage of laws supporting or even requiring the teaching of humane education in schools,&lt;ref name = "Preston, 1928" /&gt; and many teachers did teach it.&lt;ref&gt;Morrill, W. M. (Nov. 11, 1920). Humane education and the teacher. ''Journal of Education'','' 100''(2), 462.&lt;/ref&gt;  The animal welfare organizations also visited schools and other youth centers to teach “push-in” programs that supplemented—and possibly augmented—the children’s other education.

In addition to school-based programs and activities, humane education was initially conducted as well through [[Bands of Mercy]]; although these have been disbanded, humane education continues to be conducted in community-based settings.  These include animal shelters, humane education centers and parks as well as, e.g., [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Clubs]], [[YWCA]]s and [[YMCA]]s, cultural and religious centers, etc.

Currently, humane education is primarily conducted by animal welfare organizations—and organizations that include humane education among their primary focuses—such as the [https://www.latham.org/ Latham Foundation], the Association of Professional Humane Educators ([Association of Professional Humane Educators|APHE]), International Network for Humane Education ([[InterNICHE]]), and [https://www.actasia.org/ ACTAsia].&lt;ref name = "Unti &amp; DeRosa, 2003" /&gt;

==General Goals, Content, and Pedagogical Strategies==
Humane education often looks to help the compassion and concern that children and adolescents have towards one group be extended to other groups. One of the beliefs that helped establish humane education as a field has been that helping children learn to treat animals with kindness will encourage them to grow up to be adults who are kind to all animals, human and non-human.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, K. L. &amp; Gullone, E. (2003). Promotion of empathy and prosocial behaviour in children through humane education. ''Australian Psychologist'', ''38'', 175 – 182.&lt;/ref&gt;  This “cross-fertilization” of kindness is also used, e.g., to try to have the care that children have for their own pets be extended to animals in their community, animals in circuses and zoos, animals in agriculture and on [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]], or to show how reducing pollution in one’s neighborhood can help ecosystems far away.&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, W. E. (2007). Humane education: How to nurture empathy in children. ''Encyclopædia of Human-Animal Relationships: A Global Exploration of Our Connections with Animals'' (pp. 680 – 683), M. Bekoff and J. Nystrom (Eds.), Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical Current Content===
In addition to the humane treatment of domestic animals, humane education now often examines broader issues including human relationships and animal exploitation. Common topics currently covered include responsible pet care (e.g., spaying/neutering and responsible adoption); animal agriculture; factory farming; captive wild animals; understanding animal emotions, sentience, and communication; blood sports; bite prevention; ecological stewardship; the interconnectedness of life; pollution; reduction/reuse/recycling of materials; bullying; non-violent conflict resolution; critical thinking, child labor; and the effects of every-day activities on other people, animals, and the environment.

===Pedagogical Strategies===
Since the beginning, humane education has focused on what is now often called [[service-learning]] and [[experiential learning]].&lt;ref name = "Unti &amp; DeRosa, 2003" /&gt; Organizations that conduct humane education programs, therefore, often create community- or home-based activities in which students can learn humane education content and behaviors through experience and reflection.

Humane education programs may be conducted in a variety of ways in schools. Programs may be supplemental or add-on programs such as when a humane educator or the teacher of record will devote a class period to humane education content; in these cases, the lesson is often devoted wholly to teach humane education content (e.g., responsible pet or environmental care, spaying/neutering, respect for others). Programs may also be infused into the curriculum or add-ins. These infused programs allow for the most effective form of Humane Pedagogy (a teaching approach inspired by Critical Pedagogy, which attempts to help students activate cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains of learning and determine personal values.) &lt;ref name=rename3&gt;Itle-Clark, S. (2013).Inservice teachers' understanding and teaching of humane education before and after a standards-based intervention. Dissertation. Fielding Graduate University.&lt;/ref&gt; The strongest humane pedagogy is part of both the written and unwritten curriculum.

Humane education may also be integrated into traditional lessons. Since most children and adolescents find animals and nature to be engaging topics, humane education can be an effective vehicle to also teach other content, such as literature, history, civics, or science.

==Effectiveness==
Although teachers who use humane education often report ancedotal evidence that it works, and although there is a welter of qualitative research that also suggests it is effetive, there are few objective, well-controlled studies that compare humane education programs against good control groups. Nonetheless, those few studies that do study it carefully tend to find that it is effective---probably at least as effective as other, comparable non-humane education programs.

===Animal-Assisted Education===
Animal-assisted education is education that is employs direct interaction/perception of animals to enhance learning. One such program, studied by Julie Sprinkle&lt;ref&gt;Sprinkle, J. E. (2008). Animals, empathy, and violence: Can animals be used to convey principles of prosocial behavior to children? ''Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice'', ''6'', 47-58&lt;/ref&gt;, used shelter dogs in a school-based violence prevention and character education program. According to the researcher, "[f]indings indicate that receiving the program significantly alters students’ normative beliefs about aggression, levels of empathy, and displays of violent and aggressive behaviors."

===Push-in Programs===
Probably the [https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1Xbqx38nswP8OH largest study of humane education ever conducted]&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, W. E. (2018). Nurturing kindness naturally: A humane education program’s effect on the prosocial behavior of first and second graders across China. ''International Journal of Educational Research'', ''91'', 49 – 64. doi: 10.1016/j.ijer.2018.08.001.&lt;/ref&gt; included a "large evaluation conducted over 3 separate years in 25 public elementary schools in 5 cities across eastern China". The author randomly assigned about half of the schools to participate in Caring-for-Life, a humane education program, and randomly assigned the other half to the control group. In all, the effect of the program was tested on over 2,000 first and second grade students. Te author reports that "[s]tudents who participated in the program displayed significantly greater gains in [[Prosociality|prosociality]] than similar students who didn’t. Students who participated in an expanded version of the program appeared to realize even greater gains".

[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08927936.2016.1228751 Another experimental-vs-control study]&lt;ref&gt;W.E. Samuels, L. Meers, S. Normando (2016). Improving upper elementary students’ humane attitudes and prosocial behaviors through an in-class humane education program, ''Anthrozoös'', ''29''(4) pp. 597-610, doi: 10.1080/08927936.2016.1228751&lt;/ref&gt; compared the effect of the Roots and Shoots humane education program on elementary students in several schools in two cities in the United States. The authors found that "[s]tudents who participated in the humane education program showed stronger growth in both of these outcomes compared with students in the control group". However, they did not find differences in disruptive behaviors between students who participated in the humane education program and the control program (a chess club). Overall, the authors state that "[e]ffects appeared strongest on attitudes; behavioral effects were found to be largely limited to behaviors directly addressed by the humane education program".

===Duration of Effects===
The effects of a humane education program seem to last for at least a year. Piek and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Piek, R. Kane, D. Rigoli, S. Mclaren, C.M. Roberts, R. Rooney, L. Straker (2015). Does the Animal Fun program improve social-emotional and behavioural outcomes in children aged 4–6 years? ''Human Movement Science'', ''43'', 155-163&lt;/ref&gt; found that young children randomly assigned to participate in the Animal Fun program, which "was designed to enhance motor and social development in young children" showed significant improvements in teacher-rated prosocial behaviour and total difficulties compared to children randomly assigned to the control group. The effect of the program was found to still be strong not only 6 months but also 12 and 18 months later. As the authors states, "The Animal Fun program appears to be effective in improving social and behavioural outcomes".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2329">'''Integrated human studies''' is an emerging educational field that equips people with [[knowledge]] and competencies across a range of disciplines to enable them to address the challenges facing [[Human|human beings]] this century. It differs from other [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] educational initiatives in that its [[curriculum]] is purpose designed rather than simply an [[Amalgamation (fiction)|amalgamation]] of existing disciplines.

[[Kyoto University]] in Japan has offered a formal course in Integrated Human Studies since 1992 when it reorganized its College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and renamed it the Faculty of Integrated Human Studies. This was subsequently (in 2003) integrated with the Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies to create the new Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soujin/index_e.php Kyoto University] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Western Australia]] established the Center for Integrated Human Studies in early 2008. This center brings together the [[science]]s, [[social science]]s, [[Arts and Humanities in Higher Education|arts and humanities]] to focus on the nature and future of humankind. Its fundamental concern is to promote human well-being at an individual, local and global level within a sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihs.uwa.edu.au Integrated Human Studies, University of Western Australia] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Integration of disciplinary fields has arisen as a response to the “increasing [[Specialization of knowledge|specialization]] of [university] courses to meet the demands of [[Technological change|technological progress]], [[economic growth]] and [[Vocational education|vocational training]]”&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Neville. [http://u08.cgpublisher.com/proposals/237/index_html Abstract for World Universities Forum] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the development of ever narrower fields of study at tertiary level. Proponents of integrated human studies believe that a broader, interdisciplinary approach is needed to enable future [[Decision-making|decision-makers]] to grasp the complexities of the issues facing humankind in the [[21st century]] and craft workable solutions.

{{Other uses|Castaing}}

'''Jean Castaing''' ({{fl.|1685–1700}}) was a French engineer and inventor of the [[Castaing machine]], a device used to add edge lettering to coins. Though edge lettering had existed for over a century, the earliest methods were costly and time-consuming. In 1649, [[Peter Blondeau]] introduced a new method at the [[Royal Mint]] in England, which he kept secret. Later, in 1685, Castaing proposed that his machine be used in the mints of France. His proposal was approved, and Castaing later became general manager of all the mints in the nation.

Castaing introduced other ideas, including the reforming and recoining of already existing French coins with edge lettering to reduce instances of counterfeiting and raise money for [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]'s efforts in the [[Nine Years' War]]. During the carrying out of one such operation, Castaing was accused of malversation. His wife, Marie Hippolyte Castaing (née Bosch) petitioned the court on his behalf, and he was freed two years later. He died at some point in the early eighteenth century.

Before [[milled coinage]] gained precedence in Europe, the irregular and crude [[hammered coinage]] was relatively easy to counterfeit and subject to clipping, an act which involved removing valuable metal from the edge of a coin before placing it back into circulation.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985a|p=60}} In the sixteenth century, the French engineer [[Aubin Olivier]] introduced to France the coin press, to which he added a split collar capable of creating edge lettering.{{sfn|Spink, 1908|p=10455}} In order to remove the newly struck coin, the collar had to be disassembled, which was a time-consuming process. In addition, the upper coinage die was prone to strike the collar on its descent, causing expensive damage.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985a|p=63}} [[Peter Blondeau]] addressed those concerns when, in 1649, he was summoned to the [[Royal Mint]] in England to modernise minting operations there.{{sfn|Verture, 1780|p=17}} Blondeau introduced a method for edge lettering which he claimed was considerably faster and less costly than the earlier, well-known technology, but he maintained secrecy in regards to the device.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985a|p=63}}

In {{circa|1679}}, Jean Castaing invented a machine capable of applying edge lettering to 20,000 coins daily.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985b|p=1748}}{{sfn|Encyclopédie, 1765|p=665}} He approached the French government in 1685 in the hope of getting it adopted into use at the French mints.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985b|p=1748}} [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] was a proponent of the machine, but its introduction was opposed by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], Louis' financial minister, who believed edge lettering unnecessary and the machines too costly to install.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985a|pp=66–67}} In 1686, however, Castaing's proposal was approved by the [[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Council of State]], and he entered into a contract to install his machine at the various French mints.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985a|p=67}}

== Recoining and arrest ==

In 1688, Castaing proposed a method of reshaping and restriking existing coins, both as a response to counterfeiting and to help the Louis XIV raise money to support the [[Nine Years' War]].{{sfn|Ewing, 1985a|p=67}} The French government approved Castaing's method, because it was considerably less costly than the alternative method of melting the coins before restriking them.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985b|p=1751}} A Paris tinsmith, [[Martin Masselin]], was chosen to undertake the job of [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], blanching, and edge-marking{{efn|Masselin was obliged to pay Castaing an annual fee of 2,000 livres for the use of his machine in this process.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985a|p=67}}}} the recoined pieces; he was paid fourteen [[French denier|deniers]] for each coin, with an additional 17 deniers for each restruck within the first three months of his contract.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985b|p=1751}} In 17 months of his contract, a deficit of 150,000 [[French livre|livre]]s was discovered at the [[Paris Mint]], and Masselin was charged with stealing the pieces. He and his clerks in Paris and at the provincial mints were dismissed, and in 1691, Castaing was given general management of all twenty-six French mints and the task of restriking the old coinage.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985b|p=1751}} Castaing was paid eight deniers for each coin restruck, and when the King ordered a second reformation of the currency in 1693, Castaing's wage was reduced to three deniers per coin.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985b|p=1751}}

On 21 March, 1700, Castaing was arrested on charges of malversation, including using inaccurate scales to weigh the coins prior to their being reminted and stealing.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985b|pp=1751–1755}} According to the numismatist George E. Ewing, Jr., Castaing's accuser, Jacques Fournier de Saint Andre, was engaged in a conspiracy along with two Paris Mint guard judges, men named Maigret and Burgoing, with the intent of having Castaing wrongly convicted.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985a|p=67}} Ewing states that Fournier desired Castaing's position as general manager, and Maigret wanted to evict the inventor, to whom he was obliged to rent an apartment near the Mint for the mandated price of 450 livres annually, so he could raise the rent.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985a|p=67–68}} Castaing's wife, Marie Hippolyte Castaing (née Bosch) was angered by the charges against her husband, petitioning Fournier to compensate them 10,000 livres for damages as well as offer an apology.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985a|p=69}} She accused Fournier of being a "slanderer, impostor and an ignorant in money matters," and charged that he and the two guard judges had threatened to cause harm to Castaing due to his actions at the mints, which caused them to lose 30,000 livres following the King's 1693 decree.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985b|p=1753}} Two years after his arrest, the lawsuit against him was dropped by the Council of State, and Castaing was released. Fournier was ordered to pay him 6,000 livres in damages, as well as three-fourths of trial expenses.{{sfn|Ewing, 1985b|p=1756}} Castaing died at some point in the early eighteenth century.{{sfn|de Feller, 1838|p=96}}

"'''Kitsunegari'''" is the eighth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 5)|fifth season]] of American science fiction television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It was written by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Tim Minear]], and directed by [[Daniel Sackheim]]. It aired in the United States on January 4, 1998 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network. "Kitsunegari" earned a Nielsen household rating of 11.6, being watched by 19.75 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics.

The show centers on FBI Special Agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully search for the infamous killer [[List of Monster-of-the-Week characters in The X-Files#Robert Patrick Modell|Robert "Pusher" Modell]] ([[Robert Wisden]])—a human with the ability to force his will onto others—after he escapes from prison. The agents soon discover that he is not their only concern; he has a sister, and she is just as capable of mind-control as he is.

"Kitsunegari" serves as a sequel to the third-season episode "[[Pusher (The X-Files)|Pusher]]". The episode's title means "Fox hunt" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Minear's original story for the episode was one where a convicted criminal who happened to be an [[atheist]] would have heard the voice of [[God]], commanding him to kill a truly evil man. Series creator [[Frank Spotnitz]] suggested that Minear should use fan favorite Robert Modell.

== Plot ==
In [[Lorton, Virginia]], Robert Patrick Modell escapes from a prison hospital, after which the guard on duty dazedly says, "He had to go." Later, [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]), [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]), and [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) arrive at the prison and learn that Modell had suddenly woken up from his coma, [[Pusher (The X-Files)|caused when Mulder shot him]], six months previously.

Scully worriedly asks Mulder if he's deliberately playing Modell's game again by heading the investigation. The agents learn from Modell's physical therapist that the Little Sisters of Charity, who try to visit all the hospitalized inmates, have been seeing Modell. Modell calls the prison and talks to Mulder, who refuses to listen. The call is traced to a sports shop in [[Occoquan, Virginia]] where a Carbo-Bar wrapper is left on the counter. Later, Modell is holding a picture of a young woman in a house where a man is covered in [[Cerulean]] Blue paint.

The agents identify the dead man as Nathan Bowman, who was the [[prosecutor]] at Modell's trial. "Kitsunegari", the Japanese term for "fox hunt", is written on the walls in blue paint. A paint smudge leads the agents to Nathan's wife Linda, a realtor who has an appointment with a "Mr. Fox Mulder" at a commercial property. Modell uses his influence to affect the first two officers to arrive, but he is not found. When she arrives, Linda tells the agents that her husband had talked about Modell. Mulder is confused, as Modell's actions do not fit his previous ''[[modus operandi]]''. He investigates a nearby building, where he runs into Modell. Modell tries to get Mulder to listen to him, and eventually breaks Mulder's resolve.

Mulder later tells Scully that he does not believe Modell is on another killing spree and, after an odd interview with Linda, believes she is the killer and has the same powers as Modell. Skinner suspends Mulder, but Mulder vows to prove his theory right. He talks with Modell's therapist again, who mentions that a nun from the Little Sisters of Charity had called him a "conquered warrior". On a hunch, Mulder tries to show her a picture of Linda. The phone rings and, after stating she is with Mulder, she sticks her hand into a fuse box and is fatally electrocuted.

At the FBI safe house, a police car arrives with Modell. Modell enters the room that Linda is in and locks the door behind him. Mulder tells Scully the news of the therapist's death and urges her to keep Linda away from a phone. At the safe house, Skinner finds the door of Linda's room locked. He kicks the door down to find Modell and Linda, with Modell calmly saying that he has a gun. Without hesitation, Skinner shoots Modell when he sees a gun in Modell's hand, but, once he is on the ground, Skinner sees that his hand is curled into the shape of the gun.

As Modell is taken away on a stretcher, Mulder arrives and thinks that Modell forced Skinner to shoot him on purpose to protect Linda Bowman. Scully says that Linda has been taken home, at which an annoyed Mulder leaves to see Modell in the hospital. A nurse enters the hospital room and tells Mulder that she has to change the patient's bandages. When Mulder leaves, it is revealed that the nurse is actually Linda Bowman wearing a paper with "Nurse" written on it. Linda then talks Modell's heart into stopping. A nurse runs past Mulder, and he follows her into Modell's room, where Modell is pronounced dead. Mulder notices the "Nurse" paper has "214 Channel Avenue" on the back. That night, Mulder visits the address and finds Scully pointing a gun at him and claiming to be controlled by Linda; she kills herself. Mulder hears footsteps behind him and turns around to see Linda Bowman pointing a gun at him; "Linda" states personal information about Mulder, revealing herself to indeed be Scully despite what Mulder sees. She fires a shot at a figure moving behind Mulder, and he then sees Scully in front of him and the wounded Linda behind him. In Skinner's office, Linda Bowman's brain scan shows an advanced [[temporal lobe]] tumor, just like her [[fraternal twin]], Robert Modell; the two had been separated at birth. Mulder has misgivings about nearly killing Scully and feels that he ultimately lost Linda's game.&lt;ref name="plot"&gt;Meisler, pp. 98–109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The episode was written by [[Tim Minear]] and  [[Vince Gilligan]], and directed by [[Daniel Sackheim]].&lt;ref name="DVDliner"/&gt; Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal who happened to be an [[atheist]]. While in prison, he would have heard the "voice of God" commanding him to kill a truly evil man. The prisoner would have then escaped, with only Mulder believing that he was working for the greater good. Minear noted that "I pitched it and I was going to do it, eventually, until we found ourselves at a point in the year where we needed a script really fast."&lt;ref name="prod1"&gt;Meisler, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producer [[Frank Spotnitz]] suggested that the "convicted atheist" be replaced with Robert Modell from the [[The X-Files (season 3)|third season]] episode "[[Pusher (The X-Files)|Pusher]]". Minear thus put aside the "Word of God" story (as it was called), and worked with Gilligan to write the final script.&lt;ref name="prod1"/&gt;

Robert Wisden, who had played Modell in the original episode, was re-hired for this episode, and [[Diana Scarwid]] was chosen to play Modell's sister. The scenes taking place at the Lorton Penitentiary cafeteria were actually filmed at a former hospital storage facility. In order to dress the set, the structure had to be cleared of aged detritus and garbage; this required the destruction of several large [[sump pump]]s, which were "jackhammered into smithereens".&lt;ref name="prod1"/&gt; The body of Nathan Bowman, Linda's husband, was created by drenching an in-house dummy with the correct shade of paint.&lt;ref name="prod1"/&gt; The episode's title, "Kitsunegari" (狐狩り) is a Japanese term meaning "fox hunting". The series hired two Japanese translators to produce the proper Japanese translation of the phrase and its associated ''[[Japanese writing system|Kanji]]'' glyph, due to the fact that "fox hunting" is not a pre-existing term in the Japanese language.&lt;ref name="prod2"&gt;Meisler, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
"Kitsunegari" premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on January 4, 1998.&lt;ref name="DVDliner"&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=The X-Files: The Complete Fifth Season |titlelink=The X-Files (season 5) |origyear=1997–98 |others=[[R. W. Goodwin]], et al |type=booklet |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 11.6, with a 17 share, meaning that roughly 11.6 percent of all television-equipped households, and 17 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode.&lt;ref name="Ratings"/&gt; It was viewed by 19.75 million viewers.&lt;ref name="Ratings"&gt;Meisler, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. [[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen'', rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two wrote that, while "it lacks Vince Gilligan's trademark wit", the episode takes the plot threads started in "Pusher" to their "logical conclusions".&lt;ref name="shearman"/&gt; Shearman and Pearson explained that the episode's acting, most notably that of Robert Wisden and Diana Scarwid, "helps raise 'Kitsunegari' above the average."&lt;ref name="shearman"&gt;Shearman and Pearson, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Zack Handlen from ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a C+. He wrote that, despite his love for "Pusher", "'Kitsunegari' isn't anywhere near as good as its predecessor".&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; Handlen cited the change in Modell's personality, his lack of a desire to kill, and Scully's portrayal as a "humorless scold who only sees the truth when required to for narrative convenience" as reasons why the episode was weak.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; He concluded that "Kitsunegari" was "not very well put together".&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite web|last=Handlen|first=Zack|title='Kitsunegari'/'The Hand Of St. Sebastian'|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/kitsunegarithe-hand-of-st-sebastian,55654/|publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]''|accessdate=25 June 2012|date=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paula Vitaris from ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four.&lt;ref name=cinepaula&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitaris|first=Paula|title=Fifth Season Episode Guide|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=October 1998|volume=30|issue=7/8|pages=29–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; She called the entry "tame" compared to its original, although she understood the show's desire to write a sequel.&lt;ref name=cinepaula/&gt; Vitaris also criticized the fact that Modell never murdered anyone and called the episode's basic plot "cheesy". She did, however, compliment several of the episode's set pieces, such as "Nathan Bowman covered in cerulean blue paint"—which she called "striking"—and the scene wherein "Linda stops the heart of the suffering Modell", calling the latter "sensately performed."&lt;ref name=cinepaula/&gt;

The [[UK Albums Chart]] is a weekly [[record chart]] based on sales of [[albums]] in the United Kingdom. The first weekly albums chart in the UK was published by ''[[Record Mirror]]'' in July 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/album_chart_history_1956.php|title=1956|first=Sharon|last=Mawer|year=2008|publisher=[[The Official UK Charts Company]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308002257/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/album_chart_history_1956.php|archivedate=8 March 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; – since then, 26 albums by deceased artists have [[wiktionary:posthumously|posthumously]] reached number one.

The death of a musician can often result in an immediate increase in sales of their albums.

A '''lost work''' is a document, [[literature|literary]] work, or piece of multimedia produced some time in the past of which no surviving copies are known to exist. In contrast, surviving copies of old or ancient works may be referred to as ''extant''. 
Works may be lost to history either through the destruction of the original manuscript, or through the loss of all later copies of a work. The term most commonly applies to works from the [[Classics|classical world]], although it is increasingly used in relation to more modern works.

Works or fragments may survive, either found by [[archaeology|archaeologists]], or accidentally by anyone, as in the case of the [[Nag Hammadi library]] scrolls. Works also survived when they were reused as [[bookbinding]] materials; when they were quoted or included in other works; or as [[palimpsest]]s, which are documents made of materials that originally had one work written on them, but which were then cleaned and reused. The discovery in 1822 of large parts of [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De re publica]]'' was one of the first major recoveries of an ancient text from a palimpsest, while another famous example is the discovery of the [[Archimedes palimpsest]], which had been used to make a prayer book almost 300 years later. Works may be recovered in libraries as a lost or mislabeled [[codex]], a palimpsest, or even as a part of another book or codex.

Most known missing works are described by works or compilations that survive, such as the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] or the ''[[De Architectura]]'' by [[Vitruvius]]. Sometimes authors destroyed their own works. Other times they instructed others to destroy the work after their deaths; such action was not taken in several well-known cases, such as that of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', which was saved by [[Augustus]], and [[Kafka]]'s novels, which were saved by [[Max Brod]]. Handwritten [[manuscripts]] existed in very limited copies before the era of printing, so the destruction of [[List of libraries in the ancient world|ancient libraries]], including the [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria|multiple attempts on Alexandria]], resulted in the loss of numerous works. Of course works that no one has subsequently referred to remain unknown.

Deliberate destruction of works may be termed '''literary crime''' or '''literary vandalism''' (see [[book burning]]).

* During the many years of his career, [[Mark Twain]] produced a vast number of pieces, of which a considerable part — especially in his earlier years - was published in obscure newspapers under a great variety of pen names, or not published at all. Joe Goodman, who had been Twain's editor when he worked at the  [[Virginia City, Nevada]], "Territorial Enterprise", declared in 1900 that Twain wrote some of the best material of his life during his "Western years" in the late 1860s, but most of it was lost.

Plomer's own transcription was destroyed in the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. He only learned of the originals' destruction when he planned to publish a complete edition in the 1950s.

===20th century===
* The only known copies of the score of the 1903 [[Scott Joplin]] opera ''[[A Guest of Honor (opera)|A Guest of Honor]]'' were believed to be confiscated during a dispute between Joplin and the owner of a theatrical boarding house.

Also lost are Baum's 1904 short stories "Mr. Rumple's Chill" and "Bess of the Movies", as well as his early plays ''Kilmourne, or O'Connor's Dream'' (opened April 4, 1883) and ''The Queen of Killarney'' (1883).

With the beginning of World War II Orwell's views on [[pacifism]] were to change radically, so he may well have destroyed the manuscript.
* Lost papers and a possible unfinished novel by [[Isaac Babel]], confiscated by the NKVD, May 1939. [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/11/books/11NOTE.html?ei=5070&amp;en=f603c2d6191ed90f&amp;ex=1144987200&amp;pagewanted=print]

The '''''Mond Crucifixion''''' (or '''''Crocifissione Gavari'''''; both names are after former owners) is a [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]].

An early work influenced by [[Perugino]], it was originally an [[altarpiece]] in the church of [[San Domenico, Città di Castello]], near Raphael's hometown of [[Urbino]]. The painting shows [[Jesus]] on the cross, who is looking peaceful even though he is dying. There are two angels catching his blood in chalices. On Jesus' left kneels [[Mary Magdalene]], with [[John the Evangelist]] standing behind her. On his right [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] stands, and [[Jerome|St. Jerome]], to whom the altar was dedicated, is kneeling. At the foot of the cross is the inscription &lt;small&gt;RAPHAEL/ VRBIN / AS /.P.[INXIT]&lt;/small&gt; ("Raphael of Urbino painted this") in silver letters.

The painting was bequeathed to the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] by [[Ludwig Mond]].

The sun and moon at the top are present despite the [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]] prohibition of such symbology for its reference to other religions.{{dubious|date=July 2017}}

==Painting materials==
The painting was analyzed in the National Gallery London&lt;ref&gt;Roy, A., Spring, M., Plazzotta, C. ‘Raphael’s Early Work in the National Gallery: Paintings before Rome‘. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 25, pp 4–35.&lt;/ref&gt; and the typical [[pigments]] of the [[Renaissance]] period were identified. He painted the Crucifixion among other pigments with natural [[ultramarine]], [[lead-tin-yellow]], [[verdigris]], [[vermilion]] and [[ochres]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/raphael-moon-crucifixion/ Raphael, The Mond Crucifixion], ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mongol–Langam languages''' are a language family of [[East Sepik Province]], [[Papua New Guinea]].

==Languages==
According to [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]] data from 2003, the member languages had the following number of speakers:
*[[Mongol language (Papua New Guinea)|Mongol]] (Mwakai), 340 speakers&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2009|loc=[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=mgt]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Langam language|Langam]] (Pondi), 410 speakers&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2009|loc=[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lnm]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Yaul language|Yaul]] (Ulwa), 1,210 speakers&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2009|loc=[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=yla]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[Donald Laycock]] (1973) noted that the Mongol–Langam languages mark nouns for [[plural]]isation, like the [[Lower Sepik languages]] (Nor–Pondo languages) and [[Yuat languages]], and also that the lexicon also shows many resemblances to Yuat languages, while pronouns are similar to the [[Grass languages|Grass (Keram) languages]] (Ramu).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laycock|1973|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PH4OAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=mongol 36]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] (2005) accepts them as [[Ramu languages]] based on their pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; With additional data from recent research, Usher confirms their position in the Keram branch of the Ramu family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/keram-and-ramu-rivers/keram-river/west-keram-river West Keram River – NewGuineaWorld]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moral rights''' are [[rights]] of creators of [[copyright]]ed works generally recognized in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, in some [[common law]] jurisdictions. They include the right of [[attribution (copyright)|attribution]], the right to have a work published [[anonymity|anonymously]] or [[pseudonym]]ously, and the right to the integrity of the work.&lt;ref&gt;"moral, adj.". OED Online. September 2011. Oxford University Press. 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The preserving of the integrity of the work allows the author to object to alteration, distortion, or mutilation of the work that is "prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P123_20726], Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, September 9, 1886, art. 6bis, S. Treaty Doc. No. 27, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Anything else that may detract from the artist's relationship with the work even after it leaves the artist's possession or ownership may bring these moral rights into play. Moral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. Even if an artist has assigned his or her copyright rights to a work to a third party, he or she still maintains the moral rights to the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sundara Rajan, Mira T.|date=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bkzKM4pvyB4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Copyright and Creative Freedom: A Study of Post-Socialist Law Reform|page= 41-42|series= Routledge Studies in International Law|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis| ISBN= 978-0-20396-776-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral rights were first recognized in [[France]] and [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rigamonti, Cyrill P.|title= Deconstructing Moral Rights|journal=Harvard International Law Journal|volume= 47|issue= 2 |date=Summer 2006|page= 353-412}}&lt;/ref&gt; before they were included in the ''[[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]]'' in 1928.&lt;ref name=kwall&gt;Kwall, Roberta Rosenthal (2010) [https://books.google.ca/books?id=smES_wO_NscC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=the+soul+of+creativity+kwall&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YW7GYnpF9Q&amp;sig=AE0n0MnGyJmeY8gbK7z1rQcxphQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CMWmTqqrObLE0AHRy_2hDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Soul of Creativity: Forging a Moral Rights Law for the United States''], Stanford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-80475-643-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}} [[Canada]] recognizes moral rights (''droits moraux'') in its ''Copyright Act'' (''Loi sur le droit d'auteur'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/section-14.html Copyright Act] (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]] became a signatory to the convention in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/results.jsp?countries=US&amp;cat_id=11 Countries]&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated a version of moral rights under its copyright law under Title 17 of the U.S. Code.

Some jurisdictions allow for the [[waiver]] of moral rights.&lt;ref name=kwall/&gt;{{rp|44-45}} In the United States, the ''[[Visual Artists Rights Act]] of 1990 (VARA)'' recognizes moral rights, but applies only to a narrow subset of works of [[visual art]].&lt;ref&gt;Gassaway, Laura (December 2002) "Copyright and moral rights", ''Information Outlook'', Vol. 6, No. 12, p. 40 (Copyright Corner)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions like Austria differentiate between narrow and wide moral rights. Whilst the former is about integrity of the work, the latter limits usages, which may harm the author's integrity. Some copyright timestamp services allow an author to publish allowed and disallowed usage intentions to prevent a violation of such wider moral rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.registeredcommons.org/faq/#f15 RegisteredCommons.org FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berne Convention==
Through the Rome Revision of the Berne Convention in 1928, the Berne Convention accepted two forms of moral rights; paternity and integrity. These rights are included in Article 6bis of the ''Berne Convention'' as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Independent of the author's economic rights, and even after the transfer of the said rights, the author shall have the right to claim authorship of the work and to object to any distortion,  modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to the said work, which would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P123_20726], Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, September 9, 1886, art. 6bis, S. Treaty Doc. No. 27, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In Europe===

In most of Europe, it is not possible for authors to assign or even waive their moral rights. This is following a tradition in European copyright itself, which is regarded as an item of property which cannot be sold, but only licensed. Parties certainly can agree not to enforce them (and such terms are very common in contracts in Europe). There may also be a requirement for the author to 'assert' these moral rights before they can be enforced. In many books, for example, this is done on a page near the beginning, in and amongst the British Library/Library of Congress data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hoppe-Jänisch |first=Daniel |date=19 May 2015 |title=IP Assignment Clauses in International Employment Contracts |publisher=Lexology |publication-place=London |page=9 |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/document.ashx?g=365c8b4a-efe5-45c7-872f-88ca68042d7a |accessdate=3 August 2015 | quote=European copyright systems provide for a stronger connection between the copyright and the author of the protected work. This makes sense if one considers that even though the German ''Urheberrecht'' or the French ''droit d'auteur'' are often translated as ''copyright'', the literal translation is ''author’s right''. It comprises not only proprietary rights but also moral rights. In many European jurisdictions, only the proprietary rights are assignable; in others, copyrights, including the proprietary rights, cannot be assigned at all but authors may only grant others a license to exploit the protected work. Moral rights are usually not assignable and can be waived only to a limited extent. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Canada===
{{main|Moral rights in Canadian copyright law}}
Section 14.1 of [[Copyright law of Canada|Canada's Copyright Act]] protects the moral rights of authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/section-14.html Copyright Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42)]&lt;/ref&gt; The moral rights cannot be assigned, but can be waived contractually. Many publishing contracts in Canada now contain a standard moral right waiver.

Moral rights in Canada were famously exercised in the case of ''[[Snow v. The Eaton Centre Ltd.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Snow v. The Eaton Centre Ltd.'' (1982) 70 C.P.R. (2d) 105&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case [[Toronto Eaton Centre]], a large shopping mall, had commissioned the artist Michael Snow for a sculpture of Canada Geese.  Snow successfully stopped Eaton's from decorating the geese with bows at Christmas.

===In China===
Article 20 of the [[s:Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China (1990)|Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China (1990)]] provides unlimited term of protection of the rights of authorship, alteration, and integrity of an author. As Article 55 of the same Law provides retroactive protection of unexpired term on the date of entry into force of this Law, the Chinese perpetual moral rights are retroactive as well. The [[s:Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China (2001)|2001]] version retains this provision and the original Article 55 becomes Article 59.

===In Ghana===
Art. 18, [http://portal.unesco.org/culture/admin/file_download.php/gh_copyright_2005_en.pdf?URL_ID=30226&amp;filename=11416586343gh_copyright_2005_en.pdf&amp;filetype=application%2Fpdf&amp;filesize=526153&amp;name=gh_copyright_2005_en.pdf&amp;location=user-S/ Copyright Act, 2005]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} provides perpetual moral rights. The moral rights in Art. 6 are for proper attribution and against any distortion, mutilation or other modification of the work where that act would be or is prejudicial to the reputation of the author or where the work is discredited by the act.

===In Hong Kong===
Moral Rights is specified under Copyright Ordinance (Chapter 528) Division IV, starting from section 89.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.hk/chi/home.htm Please visit Hongkong legislation website for specified ordinance sections]&lt;/ref&gt; Author of computer program does not have Moral Rights (section 91). Moral Rights cannot be transferred unless on the death of moral rights holder (section 105 and 106).

===In India===

Moral rights are recognised under section 57 of India copyright act. Section 57 of India Copyright act refers to Author's Special rights. It states:

:(1) Independently of author's copyright, and even after the assignment either wholly or partially of the said copyright, the author of the work shall have the right to claim authorship of the work as well as the right to restrain, or claim damages in respect of 
::(a) any distortion, mutilation or other modification of the said work; or
::(b) any other action in relation to the said work which would be prejudicial to his honour or reputation.
:(2) The right conferred upon an author of a work by sub section (1), other than the right to claim authorship of the work, may be exercised by the legal representatives of the author. 

The issue of moral rights was discussed in Amar Nath Sehgal V Union of India &amp; Ors.(Amar Nath Sehgal V Union of India &amp; Ors CS/OS/No.2074/1992 decided on 21st Feb 2005. Court of Mr. Justice Pradeep Nandrajog). The case pertained to a mural that was commissioned in 1957 by Government of India during construction of Vigyan Bhavan at New Delhi. The mural in question was made of bronze had span of 140 feet sweep of 40 feet. The mural remained on display and was much appreciated till pulled down in 1979 and then consigned to storerooms of Union of India. Delhi High Court specifically referred to Berne Convention in delivering judgement. Court also awarded damages Rs. 500000 (half million) and also decreed in favor of the Amar Nath Sehgal that he would have an absolute right to recreate the mural at any place and right to sale the same.

The Court accepted existence of moral rights despite the work being commissioned work and copyright had passed over to union of India and suit being brought 13years after the said act(defense of limitations as pleaded by Government was rejected by the court).

===In Macao===
Article 41 of the [http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/99/33/declei43_en.asp Decree-Law_n.o_43/99/M] provides inalienable, unrenounceable and imprescriptible author’s personal rights.

===In Taiwan===
In [[Taiwan]], the Copyright Act has provided authors' perpetual moral rights with regard of attribution and protection against alteration in bad faith, even if the works are in the [[public domain]], as follows:
*Article 25 of the Copyright Act 1928 [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117617051400.htm]
*Article 21 of the Copyright Act 1944 [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117633033100.htm]
*Article 21 of the Copyright Act 1948, unchanged from the 1944 Act [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117637123100.htm] (The effective jurisdiction of the Republic of China became limited to [[Taiwan Area]] in 1949.)
*Article 21 of the Copyright Act 1964, unchanged from the 1948 Act [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117653063000.htm]
*Article 26 of the Copyright Act 1985 [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117674062800.htm]
*Article 26 of the Copyright Act 1990, unchanged from the 1985 Act [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117679011100.htm]
*Section 3, Articles 15-21 of the Copyright Act 1992, with the Article unchanged in the subsequent versions of the Copyright Act [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117681052200.htm] [http://www.tipo.gov.tw/en/AllInOne_Show.aspx?path=1485&amp;guid=26d93e21-7218-4b04-a4a8-44af93325c92&amp;lang=en-us]

===In the United States===

Moral rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.copyright.gov/title17/|title = United States Copyright Office|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; have had a less robust tradition in the United States. Copyright law in the United States emphasizes protection of financial reward over protection of creative attribution.&lt;ref name=kwall/&gt;{{rp|xiii}} The exclusive rights tradition in the United States is inconsistent with the notion of moral rights as it was constituted in the Civil Code tradition stemming from post-Revolutionary France. When the United States acceded to the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], it stipulated that the Convention's "moral rights" provisions were addressed sufficiently by other statutes, such as laws covering [[slander and libel]].&lt;ref name=kwall/&gt;{{rp|30}}

Some individual states have moral rights laws, particularly pertaining to visual art and artists (''See'', ''e.g.'' [[California Art Preservation Act]], [[Artists Authorship Rights Act (New York)]]). However, it is unclear if these laws, or portions thereof, are preempted by federal laws, such as the Visual Artists Rights Act.

In ''[[Gilliam v. American Broadcasting]]'', the [[Monty Python]] comedy troupe made a claim of "mutilation" (akin to a moral rights claim) in 1975 in [[lawsuit|legal proceedings]] against American TV network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for airing re-edited versions of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Monty Python, v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.'', 538 F.2d 14 (2d Cir 1976) [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/538/538.F2d.14.75-7693.76-7023.913.1058.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514191609/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/538/538.F2d.14.75-7693.76-7023.913.1058.html |date=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the case was primarily decided on the basis of whether the BBC was licensed in such a way as to allow ABC to edit the videos (paragraph 20).

====Visual Artists Rights Act====
[[Visual Artists Rights Act|The Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990]] grants authors of a "work of visual art" - e.g. photographs, paintings, sculptures, etc. - the non-transferable&lt;ref&gt;At {{USCSub|17|106A|e|1}}, "The rights conferred ... may not be transferred"&lt;/ref&gt; right to

*claim authorship
*prevent the use of one's name on any work the author did not create
*prevent use of one's name on any work that has been distorted, mutilated, or modified in a way that would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation
*prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or modification that would prejudice the author's honor or reputation
*prevent the destruction of a work of art if it is of "recognized stature"&lt;ref&gt;Gassaway, Laura (December 2002) "Copyright and moral rights", ''Information Outlook'', Vol. 6, No. 12, pp. 40-41 (Copyright Corner)&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights are distinct from any rights of copyright and ownership of a copy of the work.&lt;ref&gt;At {{USCSub|17|106A|e|2}}, "Ownership of the rights ... is distinct from ownership of any copy of that work, or of a copyright or any exclusive right under a copyright in that work."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adaptation right====
Copyright holders have the right to control adaptations, or the preparation of "[[derivative works]]". This right is given under [[copyright law in the United States|copyright law]]. ''See'' 17 U.S.C. § 106.

====Lanham Act====
Section 43 of the [[Lanham Act]] governs false and misleading advertising, and can apply in some instances to attribution of protected works. However, it cannot be used to create moral rights for works outside of the Act. ''See'' ''[[Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox]]''.

====Courtesy of non-attribution====
Authors occasionally wish to distance themselves from work they've been involved with, some to the point of not wishing to be recognized as the work's author. One way they may do this is by signing the work under a pseudonym. [[Alan Smithee]] was a traditional, collective pseudonym used between 1968 and 1999 by discontented [[Hollywood]] [[film director]]s who no longer wanted to be credited. This courtesy was not always extended, however. The director of ''[[Highlander II: The Quickening|Highlander II]]'', [[Russell Mulcahy]], wanted his name removed after the completion bond company took over film production, but he was contractually obliged not to impugn the film and he was told that using a pseudonym would impugn it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

If the work was [[unfinished work|unfinished]], sometimes the original author will choose a pseudonym as permission for the copyright holder to do whatever they wish to finish and market the unwanted work, cutting ties from the product.

'''The Museums Act 1845''' ([[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1840–1859#1845_.288_.26_9_Vict..29|8 &amp; 9 Vict]] c. 43) was an [[Act of Parliament|act]] of the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] which gave the town councils of larger [[municipal boroughs]] the power to establish museums.

==Historical background==
In the 1830s, at the height of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. This prompted much new legislation to be passed, such as the [[Parliamentary Reform Act 1832]], the [[Factory Act 1833]], the first instance of a government grant for education in the same year and the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]]. The [[capitalist]] economic model had created shift patterns which left workers with free time, in contrast to the agrarian model, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers' free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by [[Victorian era|Victorian]] middle-class [[paternalism]] rather than by demand from the [[Social structure of the United Kingdom|lower social orders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Public Library |last=McMenemy |first=David |year=2008 |publisher=Facet Publishing |location=London |pages=24–26 |isbn=978-1-85604-616-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good.

In 1835, and against government opposition, [[James Silk Buckingham]], MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the [[temperance movement]], was able to secure the chair of the [[Parliamentary Select Committees of the United Kingdom|select committee]] which would examine "the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom" and propose solutions. [[Francis Place]], a campaigner for the working class, agreed that "the establishment of parish libraries and district reading rooms, and popular lectures on subjects both entertaining and instructive to the community might draw off a number of those who now frequent public houses for the sole enjoyment they afford." &lt;ref&gt;Select Committee on inquiry into drunkenness, ''Report'' (1834)&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham introduced to Parliament a public institution bill allowing boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums, the first of its kind. Although this did not become law, it had a major influence on [[William Ewart (English politician)|William Ewart]] and [[Joseph Brotherton]], MPs, who introduced a bill which would "[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a 1/2d for the establishment of museums." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Nicaraguan literature''' can be traced to [[pre-Columbian]] times with the myths and [[oral literature]] that formed the cosmogonic view of the world that indigenous people had. Some of these stories are still known in Nicaragua. Like many Latin American countries, the Spanish conquerors have had the most effect on both the culture and the literature. The literature of [[Nicaragua]] has had many important literary figures in the Spanish language with internationally prominent writers such as [[Rubén Darío]], who is regarded as the most important literary figure in Nicaragua. He is referred to as the ''"Father of Modernism"'' for leading the [[modernismo]] literary movement at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="NI"&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Showcasing Nicaragua's Folkloric Masterpiece - El Gueguense - and Other Performing and Visual Arts | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-150984344.html | work =Encyclopedia.com | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-03 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important literary figures include [[Salomón de la Selva]], [[Carlos Martínez Rivas]], [[Pablo Antonio Cuadra]], [[Alberto Cuadra Mejia]], [[Manolo Cuadra Vega]], [[Pablo Alberto Cuadra Arguello]], [[Ernesto Cardenal]], [[Sergio Ramírez Mercado]], [[Gioconda Belli]], [[José Coronel Urtecho]], [[Alfonso Cortés]], [[Julio Valle Castillo]], and [[Claribel Alegría]], among others.

==History==
''[[El Güegüense]]'' is a satirical drama and was the first literary work of post-Columbian Nicaragua. It is regarded as one of Latin America's most distinctive colonial-era expressions and as Nicaragua's signature folkloric masterpiece combining music, dance and theater.&lt;ref name="NI"/&gt; The theatrical play was written by an anonymous author in the 16th century, making it one of the oldest indigenous theatrical/dance works of the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Native Theatre: El Gueguense | date= | publisher=Smithsonian Institution | url =http://www.nmai.si.edu/calendar/index.asp?month=10&amp;year=2006&amp;day=22 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-03 | language = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071206171831/http://www.nmai.si.edu/calendar/index.asp?month=10&amp;year=2006&amp;day=22 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed down orally for many centuries until it was finally written down and published into a book in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=El Güegüense o Macho Ratón | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.vianica.com/go/specials/21-el-gueguense-macho-raton.html | work =ViaNica | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-03 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary movements==

===Modernismo===
The [[Modernismo]] [[literary movement]] was a Spanish-American literary movement, best exemplified by Nicaraguan [[Rubén Darío]], who is respectfully referred to as the "Father of Modernism". In the late 19th century, ''Modernismo'' emerged, a poetic movement whose recapitulation was a blending of three European currents: [[Romanticism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and especially [[parnassian poets|Parnassianism]]. Inner passions, visions, harmonies and rhythms are expressed in a rich, highly stylized verbal music. This movement was of great influence in the whole Spanish-speaking world (including the [[Philippines]]), finding a temporary vogue also among the [[Spanish literature|Generación del 98]] in Spain, which posited various reactions to its perceived [[aestheticism]].

Modernismo was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly [[Latin American literature]], in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. Though Modernismo itself is often seen as aestheticist and anti-political, some poets and essayists, introduced compelling critiques of the contemporary social order and particularly the plight of Latin America's indigenous peoples.

===Poetry after Modernismo===
Twentieth-century poetry in Nicaragua has often expressed political commitment, particularly given the model provided by Chilean [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate [[Pablo Neruda]], and followed by such poets as the Nicaragua's [[Ernesto Cardenal]].

===The Vanguardia===
The Vanguardia was a literary movement that started in [[Granada, Nicaragua]] between 1927 and 1929, the movement was led by the Nicaraguan poet [[José Coronel Urtecho]]. According to literary manifests which were published in 1931, one of Coronel's objectives were to ''"initiate a struggle to get the public attention through artistic expressions, intellectual scandal, and aggressive criticism"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Poetry Festival in Granada: The Vanguardia | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.vianica.com/go/specials/22-granada-poetry-festival.html | work =ViaNica | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-06 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vanguardia literary movement reflected several European movements, especially [[Surrealism]]. Vanguardia instituted a radical search for new, daring, confrontational themes and shockingly novel forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Latin American literature: The Vanguardia | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-236894/Latin-American-literature | work =Encyclopædia Britannica | pages =13 | accessdate = 2007-08-06 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12368">{{Renaissance}}
The '''Northern Renaissance''' was the [[Renaissance]] that occurred in Europe north of the [[Alps]]. Before 1497, [[Italian Renaissance]] [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] had little influence outside Italy. From the late 15th century, its ideas spread around Europe. This influenced the [[German Renaissance]], [[French Renaissance]], [[English Renaissance]], [[Renaissance in the Low Countries]], [[Polish Renaissance]] and other national and localized movements, each with different characteristics and strengths.

In [[France]], [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] imported [[Italian art]], commissioned Italian artists (including [[Leonardo da Vinci]]), and built grand palaces at great expense, starting the [[French Renaissance]]. Trade and commerce in cities like [[Bruges]] in the 15th century and [[Antwerp]] in the 16th increased cultural exchange between Italy and the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Low Countries]], however in art, and especially architecture, late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] influences remained present until the arrival of [[Baroque]] even as painters increasingly drew on Italian models.&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Janson |first=H.W. |author2=Anthony F. Janson  |year=1997 |title=History of Art |edition=5th, rev. |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-8109-3442-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University|Universities]] and the printed book helped spread the spirit of the age through France, the Low Countries and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and then to [[Scandinavia]] and finally [[Early Modern Britain|Britain]] by the late 16th century. Writers and humanists such as [[Rabelais]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[Desiderius Erasmus]] were greatly influenced by the Italian Renaissance model and were part of the same intellectual movement. During the [[English Renaissance]] (which overlapped with the [[Elizabethan era]]) writers such as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]] composed works of lasting influence. The Renaissance was brought to [[Poland]] directly from Italy by artists from [[Florence]] and the Low Countries, starting the [[Polish Renaissance]].

In some areas the Northern Renaissance was distinct from the Italian Renaissance in its [[centralization]] of political power. While Italy and Germany were dominated by independent [[city-state]]s, most of [[Europe]] began emerging as [[nation-state]]s or even unions of countries. The Northern Renaissance was also closely linked to the [[Protestant Reformation]] with the resulting long series of internal and external conflicts between various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] groups and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] having lasting effects.

==Overview==
Feudalism had dominated Europe for a thousand years, but was on the decline at the beginning of the Renaissance.  The reasons for this decline include the post-plague environment, the increasing use of money rather than land as a [[medium of exchange]], the growing number of serfs living as freemen, the formation of nation-states with [[Monarchy|monarchies]] interested in reducing the power of feudal lords, the increasing uselessness of feudal armies in the face of new military technology (such as [[gunpowder]]), and a general increase in agricultural productivity due to improving farming technology and methods. As in Italy, the decline of feudalism opened the way for the cultural, social, and economic changes associated with the Renaissance in Europe.
[[Image:Gutenberg.press.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Reproduction of [[Johann Gutenberg]]-era Press on display at the Printing History Museum in Lyon, France. ]]

Finally, the Renaissance in Europe would also be kindled by a weakening of the Roman Catholic Church. The slow demise of feudalism also weakened a long-established policy in which church officials helped keep the population of the manor under control in return for tribute. Consequently, the early 15th century saw the rise of many secular institutions and beliefs. Among the most significant of these, [[humanism]], would lay the philosophical grounds for much of [[Renaissance art]], [[Renaissance music|music]], and [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]]. [[Desiderius Erasmus]], for example, was important in spreading humanist ideas in the north, and was a central figure at the intersection of classical humanism and mounting religious questions. Forms of artistic expression which a century ago would have been banned by the church were now tolerated or even encouraged in certain circles.

The velocity of transmission of the Renaissance throughout Europe can also be ascribed to the invention of the [[printing press]]. Its power to disseminate information enhanced [[research|scientific research]], spread political ideas and generally impacted the course of the Renaissance in northern Europe. As in Italy, the printing press increased the availability of books written in both [[vernacular]] languages and the publication of new and ancient [[classical language|classical texts]] in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]]. Furthermore, the [[Bible]] became widely available [[Bible translations|in translation]], a factor often attributed to the spread of the Protestant Reformation.

==Age of Discovery==
{{main|Age of Discovery}}
One of the most important technological development of the Renaissance was the invention of the caravel. This combination of European and African ship building technologies for the first time made extensive trade and travel over the [[Atlantic]] feasible.  While first introduced by the Italian states and the early captains, such as [[Giovanni Caboto]], [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] and [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]], who were Italian explorers, the development would end Northern Italy's role as the trade crossroads of Europe, shifting wealth and power westwards to [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[England]], and the [[Netherlands]].  These states all began to conduct extensive trade with [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], and in the [[Americas]] began extensive colonisation activities.  This period of exploration and expansion has become known as the [[Age of Discovery]].  Eventually European power spread around the globe.

==Art==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[History of painting]] --&gt;
[[Image:eyck.hubert.lamb.750pix.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' (interior view) by [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]] and [[Jan van Eyck]], painted 1432. [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]], [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]. Early Netherlandish painting often included complicated [[iconography]], and art historians have debated the "hidden symbolism" of works by artists like Hubert and [[Jan van Eyck]].]]
{{see also|Early Netherlandish painting|Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|Northern Mannerism}}
The detailed realism of [[Early Netherlandish painting]], led by Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck in the 1420s and 1430s, is today generally considered to be the beginning of the early Northern Renaissance in painting.  This detailed realism was greatly respected in Italy, but there was little reciprocal influence on the North until nearly the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;  Although the notion of a north to south-only direction of influence arose in the scholarship of [[Max Jakob Friedländer]] and was continued by [[Erwin Panofsky]], art historians are increasingly questioning its validity: Lisa Deam, "Flemish versus Netherlandish: A Discourse of Nationalism," in Renaissance Quarterly, vol. 51, no. 1 (Spring, 1998), pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite frequent cultural and artistic exchange, the [[Antwerp Mannerism|Antwerp Mannerists]] (1500–1530)—chronologically overlapping with but unrelated to Italian [[Mannerism]]—were among the first artists in the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Low Countries]] to clearly reflect Italian formal developments.  

Around the same time, [[Albrecht Dürer]] made his two trips to Italy, where he was greatly admired for his [[old master print|prints]]. Dürer, in turn, was influenced by the art he saw there and is agreed to be one of the first Northern High Renaissance painters. Other notable northern painters, such as [[Hans Holbein the Elder]] and [[Jean Fouquet]], retained a [[Gothic art|Gothic]] influence that was still popular in the north, while highly individualistic artists such as [[Hieronymus Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] developed styles that were imitated by many subsequent generations. Later in the 16th century Northern painters increasingly looked and travelled to Rome, becoming known as the [[Romanism (painting)|Romanists]]. The [[High Renaissance]] art of [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]] and the late Renaissance stylistic tendencies of Mannerism that were in vogue had a great impact on their work.

[[Renaissance humanism]] and the large number of surviving classical artworks and monuments encouraged many Italian painters to explore Greco-Roman themes more prominently than northern artists, and likewise the famous 15th-century German and Dutch paintings tend to be religious. In the 16th century, [[mythological]] and other themes from history became more uniform amongst northern and Italian artists. Northern Renaissance painters, however, had new subject matter, such as [[landscape painting|landscape]] and [[genre painting]]. 
 
As Renaissance art styles moved through northern Europe, they changed and were adapted to local customs. In England and the northern Netherlands the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] [[iconoclasm#Reformation iconoclasm|brought religious painting almost completely to an end]]. Despite several very talented [[Artists of the Tudor Court]] in England, portrait painting was slow to spread from the elite. In France the [[School of Fontainebleau]] was begun by Italians such as [[Rosso Fiorentino]] in the latest [[Mannerist]] style, but succeeded in establishing a durable national style. By the end of the 16th century, artists such as [[Karel van Mander]] and [[Hendrik Goltzius]] collected in [[Haarlem]] in a brief but intense phase of [[Northern Mannerism]] that also spread to [[Flanders]].

==The Renaissance==
The Renaissance is one of the most interesting and disputed periods of European history. Many scholars see it as a unique time with characteristics all its own. A second group views the Renaissance as the first two to three centuries of a larger era in European history usually called early modern Europe, which began in the late fifteenth century and ended on the eve of the French Revolution (1789) or with the close of the Napoleonic era (1815). Some social historians reject the concept of the Renaissance altogether. Historians also argue over how much the Renaissance differed from the Middle Ages and whether it was the beginning of the modern world, however defined. It is also said that group views the Renaissance as the first two to three centuries of a larger era in European history usually called early modern Europe.

"'''O Arise, All You Sons'''" is the [[national anthem]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The 'National Identity Act' of Papua New Guinea was formed in 1971, motivating the country to create a national flag, a national emblem, a national pledge and a national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;National Identity Act 1971, http://www.paclii.org/pg/legis/consol_act/nia1971197. Retrieved 8 Oct 2018. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Papua New Guinean national flag and emblem were adopted four years earlier. However the National Anthem remained undecided until 1975. Although many songs were submitted to be the anthem, the National Executive Council decided a week before the country's Independence Day (10 September 1975), to adopt the anthem that was composed by Chief Inspector Thomas Shacklady (1917–2006), a bandmaster of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary Band.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pngaa.net/Independence_Anniversary/national_anthem.htm "The national anthem of Papua New Guinea"], pngaa.net&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1867 interpretation of Robertson's Fantasmagorie.jpg|thumb|Interpretation of Robertson's Fantasmagorie from F. Marion's ''L'Optique'' (1867)]]
'''Phantasmagoria''' ({{Audio|En-us-phantasmagoria.ogg|American pronunciation}}, also '''fantasmagorie''', '''fantasmagoria''') was a form of horror [[theatre]] that (among other techniques) used one or more [[magic lantern]]s to project frightening images such as skeletons, demons, and ghosts onto walls, smoke, or semi-transparent screens, typically using rear projection to keep the lantern out of sight. Mobile or portable projectors were used, allowing the projected image to move and change size on the screen, and multiple projecting devices allowed for quick switching of different images. In many shows the use of spooky decoration, total darkness, (auto-)suggestive verbal presentation, and sound effects were also key elements. Some shows added all kinds of sensory stimulation, including smells and electric shocks. Even required fasting, fatigue (late shows) and drugs have been mentioned as methods of making sure spectators would be more convinced of what they saw. The shows started under the guise of actual [[séance]]s in Germany in the late 18th century, and gained popularity through most of Europe (including Britain) throughout the 19th century.

==Etymology==
From French ''phantasmagorie'', from Ancient Greek φάντασμα (''phántasma'', “ghost”) + possibly either αγορά (''agorá'', “assembly, gathering”) + the suffix -ia or ἀγορεύω (''agoreúō'', “to speak publicly”).

[[Paul Philidor]] announced his show of ghost apparitions and evocation of the shadows of famous people as ''Phantasmagorie'' in the Parisian periodical ''Affiches, annonces et avis divers'' of December 16, 1792. About two weeks earlier the term had been the title of a letter by a certain "A.L.M.", published in ''Magazin Encyclopédique''. The letter also promoted Phylidor's show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Magazin Encyclopédique|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k424100p/f21.item.r=phantasmagorie.zoom|date=1792-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylidor had previously advertised his show as ''Phantasmorasi'' in Vienna in March 1790.&lt;ref name=phantasmorasi&gt;Phylidor ''Phantasmorasi'' handbill. 1792-03&lt;/ref&gt;

The English variation ''Phantasmagoria'' was introduced as the title of M. De Philipsthal's show of optical illusions and mechanical pieces of art in London in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Paul de Philipsthal ''Phantasmagoria'' 1801 handbill&lt;/ref&gt; De Philipsthal and Phylidor are believed to have been the same person.

Some ancient sightings of gods and spirits are thought to have been conjured up by means of (concave) mirrors, [[camera obscura]] or magic lantern projections. By the 16th century [[necromancy|necromantic]] ceremonies and the conjuring of ghostly apparitions by charlatan "magicians" and "witches" seemed commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=BIL2BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife|last=Ruffles|first=Tom|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1613 book ''Opticorum Libri Sex''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/opticorumlibrise00agui|title=Opticorum Libri Sex philosophis juxta ac mathematicis utiles|year=1613|last=d'Aguilon|first=François|language=Latin|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgian Jesuit mathematician, physicist and architect [[François d'Aguilon]] described how some charlatans cheated people out of their money by claiming they knew [[necromancy]] and would raise the specters of the devil from hell and show these to the audience inside a dark room. The image of an assistant with a devil's mask was projected through a lens into the dark room, scaring the uneducated spectators.&lt;ref name=Mannoni1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books/about/The_great_art_of_light_and_shadow.html?id=t_cSAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|last=Mannoni|first=Laurent|title=The great art of light and shadow|year=2000|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1659 huygens - figure1.jpg|thumbnail|left|Huygens' 1659 sketches for a projection of Death taking off his head]]
The earliest pictures known to have been projected with lanterns were Death, hell and monsters:

[[Giovanni Fontana (engineer)|Giovanni Fontana]]'s 1420 drawing showed a lantern projecting a winged female demon.

[[Athanasius Kircher]] warned in his 1646 edition of ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' that impious people could abuse his stenographic mirror projection system by painting a picture of the devil on the mirror and projecting it into a dark place to force people to carry out wicked deeds.&lt;ref name=Gorman2007&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P333.PDF|page=49|title=Inside the Camera Obscura|first=Michael John|last=Gorman|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pupil [[Gaspar Schott]] later turned this into the idea that it could be easily used to keep Godless people from committing many sins, if a picture of the devil was painted on the mirror and thrown onto a dark place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=aGw_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA609#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Magia optica - Kaspar Schott |publisher=Books.google.nl |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1659 Dutch inventor [[Christiaan Huygens]] drew several phases of Death removing his skull from his neck and putting it back again, which were sketches meant for a projection with "convex lenses and a lamp".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christiaan|last=Huygens|title=Pour des representations par le moyen de verres convexes à la lampe|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg003oeuv22_01/huyg003oeuv22_01_0093.php|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lamp later became known as the magic lantern and the sketches form the oldest known extant documentation of this invention.

One of Christiaan Huygens' contacts wrote to him in 1660: "The good Kircher is always performing tricks with the magnet at the gallery of the [[Collegium Romanum]]; if he would know about the invention of the Lantern he would surely frighten the cardinals with specters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg003oeuv03_01/huyg003oeuv03_01_0031.php#191T|title=letter from Pierre Guisony to Christiaan Huygens|date=1660-03-25|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Rasmussen Walgensten's 1664 lantern show prompted Pierre Petit to call the device "laterne de peur" (lantern of fear). In 1670 Walgensten projected an image of Death at the court of [[King Frederick III of Denmark]].&lt;ref name=rossell2002&gt;{{cite web|first=Deac|last=Rossell|year=2002|title=The Magic Lantern|url=https://www.academia.edu/345943/The_Magic_Lantern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1668 [[Robert Hooke]] wrote about a type of magic lantern installation: "It produces effects not only very delightful, but to such as know not the contrivance very wonderful; so that spectators not well versed in optics, that should see the various apparitions and disappearances, the motions, changes and actions that may this way be represented, would readily believe them to be supernatural and miraculous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=92lnIw3oKGMC&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;ots=Ym_S2RrJ4U&amp;dq=It%20produces%20Effects%20not%20only%20very%20delightful%2C%20but%20to%20such%20as%20know%20the%20contrivance%2C%20very%20wonderful%3B%20so%20that%20Spectators%2C%20not%20well%20versed%20in%20Opticks%2C&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, from Their ... |publisher=Books.google.nl |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1671 second edition of Kircher's ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae''.&lt;ref name="ars magna"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gki6ZIbrgQ8C|title=Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae|first=Athanasius|last=Kircher|year=1671|language=latin|accessdate = 19 August 2010|pages=767–769}}&lt;/ref&gt; the magic lantern was illustrated with projections of Death and a person in purgatory or hellfire. Kircher did suggest in his book that an audience would be more astonished by the sudden appearance of images if the lantern would be hidden in a separate room, so the audience would be ignorant of the cause of their appearance.&lt;ref name=Rendel&gt;{{cite web|last2=Rendel|first2=Mats|first1=Athanasius|last1=Kircher|title=About the Construction of The Magic Lantern, or The Sorcerers Lamp|url=http://www.phonurgia.se/rendel/mageng.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend Kircher secretly used the lantern at night to project the image of Death on windows of apostates to scare them back into church,&lt;ref name=luikerwaal&gt;{{cite web|title=The miracle of the magic lantern|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/wonder1_uk.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is probably based on Gaspar Schott's suggestion (see above).

In 1672 French physician and numismatist [[Charles Patin]] was very impressed with the lantern show that "Monsieur Grundler" (Griendel) performed for him in Nuremberg: "He even stirs the shadows at his pleasure, without the aid of the underworld. (...) My esteem for his knowledge could not prevent my fright, I believed there never was a greater magician than him in the world. I experienced paradise, I experienced hell, I experienced specters. I have some constancy, but I would have willingly given one half to save the other." After these apparitions Griendel showed other subjects in this performance, including birds, a palace, a country-wedding and mythical scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=bKQvJVWriCsC&amp;dq=patin%20%22Relations%20historiques%20et%20curieuses%20de%20voyages%22&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last=Patin|first=Charles|title=Relations historiques et curieuses de voyages|year=1674|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patin's elaborate description of an early lantern show seems to be the oldest to contain more than frightening pictures.

While surviving slides and descriptions of lantern shows from the following decades included all kinds of subjects, scary pictures remained popular.&lt;ref name=rossell2002/&gt;

===Late 18th century===
The last decades of the 18th century saw the rise of the age of [[Romanticism]]. There was an obsession with the bizarre and the supernatural. This movement had elements of the bizarre and irrational, and included the rise of the [[Gothic novel]]. The popular interest in such topics explained the rise and, more specifically, the success of phantasmagoria for the productions to come.&lt;ref name="Barber"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Theodore X|title=Phantasmagorical Wonders: The Magic Lantern Ghost Show in Nineteenth-Century America Film History 3,2|year=1989|pages=73–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magic lantern was a good medium to project fantasies as its imagery was not as tangible as in other media. Since demons were believed to be incorporeal, the magic lantern could produce very fitting representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|last=Vermeir|first=Koen|title=The magic of the magic lantern|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00644485/file/VERMEIR_-_Magic_of_the_Magic_Lantern.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1770 Guyot - Nouvelles récréations physiques et mathématiques.jpg|thumb|Illustration of hidden magic lantern projection on smoke in Guyot's ''Nouvelles récréations physiques et mathématiques'' (1770)]]
When magicians started to use the magic lantern in shows, some special effects were thought up. French physician, inventor and manufacturer of conjuring apparatus and scientific instruments [[Edmé-Gilles Guyot]] described several techniques in his 1770 book ''Nouvelles récréations physiques et mathématiques'', including the projection of ghosts on smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/nouvellesrcr02guyo#page/252/mode/2up |title=Nouvelles récréations physiques et mathématiques, contenant ce qui a été imaginé de plus curieux dans ce genre et qui se découvre journellement, auxquelles on a joint, leurs causes, leurs effets, la mani¿ere de les construire, &amp; l'amusement qu'on en peut tirer pour étonner et surprendre agréablement |publisher=Archive.org |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johann Georg Schrepfer===
{{main article|Johann Georg Schröpfer}}
In the early 1770s in [[Leipzig]], Germany, coffee house owner, charlatan, necromancer and leader of an independent Freemason lodge Johann Georg Schrepfer (or Schröpfer) performed ghost-raising séances and necromantic experiments for his Freemason lodge. For typical necromantic activity his followers were asked to fast for 24 hours and were served a salad (possibly drugged) and much punch before the midnight start of séances in a darkened room with a black-draped altar. A robed Schrepfer performed the rituals and demanded his followers to remain seated at a table or face terrible dangers if they didn't. He made use of a mixture of Masonic, Catholic and Kabbalistic symbolism, including skulls, a chalk circle on the floor, holy water, incense and crucifixes. The spirits he raised were said to be clearly visible, hovering in the air, vaporous and sometimes screaming terribly. The highlight of his career was a séance for the court in the Dresden palace early in the summer of 1774. This event was impressive enough to still be described more than a century later in Germany and Britain. Apparitions reportedly raised by Schrepfer over the years included [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], the beheaded Danish "traitors" [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]] and [[Enevold Brandt]] with their heads in their hands, and the Knights Templars' last Grand Master [[Jacques de Molay]]. During a séance in Dresden Schrepfer ordered De Molay's spirit to bring a letter to a companion in Frankfurt. De Molay obeyed and returned half an hour later with an answer signed in Frankfurt by the companion. Another spirit appeared engulfed in flames begging Schrepfer not to torture him so.&lt;ref name=Geffarth&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=8TWhiohOrcUC&amp;pg=PA181|title=The Masonic Necromancer: Shifting Identities In The Lives Of Johann Georg Schrepfer|first=Renko|last=Geffarth|year=2007|pages=181–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early morning of October 8, 1774, Schrepfer reportedly committed suicide with a pistol in a park with five friends present. According to legend he was a victim of delusions about his necromantic abilities and convinced he could resurrect himself afterwards. However, there are several indications that he may actually have been murdered.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Werner Förster: Tod eines Geistersehers. Johann Georg Schrepfer. Eine vertuschte sächsische Staatsaffäre, 1774. Taurus Verlag Leipzig, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Most spectators of Schrepfer's séances were convinced that the apparitions they saw were real. No clear evidence of deceit seems to ever have been found, but critics have described several suspicions. The techniques that Schrepfer reportedly used for his elaborate effects included: actors performing as ghosts, [[ventriloquism]], hidden speaking tubes, [[glass harmonica]] sounds, aromatic smoke, [[camera obscura]] projections and/or magic lantern projections on smoke, [[concave mirror]] projections and staged thunder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/345943/The_Magic_Lantern|last=Rossell|first=Deac|title=The Magic Lantern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schrepfer had been friends with pharmacist and Freemason Johann Heinrich Linck the Younger and regularly held lodge meetings at Linck's garden house. Linck could have been helping Schrepfer with drugs and chemicals and also knew about the workings of optical and acoustic devices. Linck owned a magic lantern which was decorated with a crucifix and a skull with wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.seepiepe.de/schrepfer.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102215650/http://seepiepe.de/schrepfer.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-11-02|title=Schrepfer und der Leipziger Löwenapotheker Johann Heinrich Linck|year=2011|language=German|last=Förster|first=Otto Werner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Schrepfer's death there was a boom of publications attacking or defending his supposed abilities to raise ghosts, expanding Schrepfer's fame across Europe. Several publications included explanations of techniques he might have used to conjure apparitions, which inspired several people to recreate Schrepfer's séances. Christlieb Benedikt Funk, Professor of Physics at the Leipzig University was possibly the first to publicly re-create such ghost-raising demonstrations, but was ordered to stop by the university's authorities.&lt;ref name= Rossell2001&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/4609248/The_19_Century_German_Origins_of_the_Phantasmagoria_Show|title=The_19_Century_German_Origins_of_the_Phantasmagoria_Show|last=Rossell|first=Deac|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physicist Phylidor===
{{main article|Paul Philidor}}
The magician "phycisist" Phylidor, also known as "Paul Filidort" and probably the same as Paul de Philipsthal, created what may have been the first true phantasmagoria show in 1790. After a first ghost-raising session in Berlin in 1789 led to accusations of fraud and expulsion from Prussia, Phylidor started to market his necromantic shows as an art that revealed how charlatans fooled their audiences.&lt;ref name=chronic5&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZDZMAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q=phylidor&amp;f=false|title=Chronic von Berlin oder Berlinische Merkwürdigkeiten - Volume 5|year=1789|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; His improved show, possibly making use of the recently invented [[Argand lamp]],&lt;ref name="Grau"&gt;[[Oliver Grau|Grau, Oliver]]. ''Remember the Phantasmagoria!'' chapter from ''MediaArtHistories'', MIT Press/Leonardo Books, 2007, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; was a success in Vienna from 1790 to 1792. Phylidor advertised these shows as "Schröpferischen, und Cagliostoischen Geister-Erscheinungen" (Schröpfer-esque and Cagiostro-esque Ghost Apparitions)&lt;ref&gt;Phylidor ''Schröpferischen, und Cagliostoischen Geister-Erscheinungen'' flyer 1790&lt;/ref&gt; and as "Phantasmorasi".&lt;ref name=phantasmorasi/&gt;

From December 1792 to July 1793 "Paul Filidort" presented his "Phantasmagorie" in Paris,&lt;ref name="Rossell2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Affiches, annonces et avis divers''. 1793-07-23&lt;/ref&gt; probably using the term for the first time. It is assumed Etienne-Gaspard Robertson visited one of these shows.&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn Heard, ''Phantasmagoria'' (2006), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1801 a phantasmagoria production by Paul de Philipsthal opened in London's [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], where it became a smash hit.

===Robertson===
[[File:Fantasmagorie de Robertson.tif|thumb|Robert's phantasmagoria at the Cour des Capucines in 1797]]
[[Étienne-Gaspard Robert|Étienne-Gaspard "Robertson" Robert]], a Belgian inventor and physicist from [[Liège (city)|Liège]], was known for his phantasmagoria productions and is the most imitated. He is credited for coining the word ''fantascope'', and would refer to all of his magic lanterns by this term.&lt;ref name="Barber, Theodore 1989"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Phantasmagorical Wonders: The Magic Lantern Ghost Show in Nineteenth-Century America|last = Barber|first = Theodore|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 1989|isbn = |location = Online|pages = 73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fantascope was not a magic lantern that could be held by hand, but instead required someone to stand next to it and physically move the entire fantascope closer or further to the screen.&lt;ref name="Barber, Theodore 1989"/&gt; He would often eliminate all sources of light during his shows in order to cast the audience in total darkness for several minutes at a time.&lt;ref name="Barber, Theodore 1989"/&gt; Robertson would also lock the doors to the theater so that no audience member could exit the show once it had started.&lt;ref name="Barber, Theodore 1989"/&gt; He was also known for including multiple sound effects into his show, such as thunder clapping, bells ringing, and ghost calls.  Robertson would pass his glass slides through a layer of smoke while they were in his fantascope, in order to create an image that looked out of focus.&lt;ref name="Barber, Theodore 1989"/&gt;  Along with the smoke, he would also move most of his glass slides through his fantascope very quickly in order to create the illusion that the images were actually moving on screen.&lt;ref name="Barber, Theodore 1989"/&gt;

Robertson's first "Fantasmagorie" was presented in 1797 at the Pavillon de l'Echiquier in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Castle, Terry 1995"&gt;Castle, Terry. "Phantasmagoria and the Metaphorics of Modern Reverie." ''The Female Thermometer.'' New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1995. 140–167. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The macabre atmosphere in the post-revolutionary city was perfect for Robertson's Gothic extravaganza complete with elaborate creations and [[Ann Radcliffe|Radcliffean]] décor.

After discovering that he could put the magic lantern on wheels to create either a moving image or one that increased and decreased in size, Robertson moved his show. He sited his entertainment in the abandoned cloisters kitchen of a Capuchin convent (which he decorated to resemble a subterranean chapel) near the [[Place Vendôme]]. He staged hauntings, using several lanterns, special sound effects and the eerie atmosphere of the tomb. This show lasted for six years, mainly because of the appeal of the supernatural to Parisians who were dealing with the upheavals as a result of the [[French Revolution]]. Robertson mainly used images surrounded by black in order to create the illusion of free-floating ghosts. He also would use multiple projectors, set up in different locations throughout the venue, in order to place the ghosts in environments. For instance, one of his first phantasmagoria shows displayed a lightning-filled sky with both ghosts and skeletons receding and approaching the audience. In order to add to the horror, Robertson and his assistants would sometimes create voices for the phantoms.&lt;ref name="Barber" /&gt;  Often, the audience forgot that these were tricks and were completely terrified:

{{quotation|I am only satisfied if my spectators, shivering and shuddering, raise their hands or cover their eyes out of [[fear of ghosts]] and [[devil]]s dashing towards them.|Étienne-Gaspard Robert}}

In fact, many people were so convinced of the reality of his shows that police temporarily halted the proceedings, believing that Robertson had the power to bring [[Louis XVI]] back to life.&lt;ref name="Barber" /&gt; Once the show was back, Robertson was exposed to the law again, this time in the form of a lawsuit against his former assistants who had started their own phantasmagoria shows using his techniques. It was this lawsuit in 1799 in which Robertson was required to reveal his secrets to the public and magic lantern shows popped up across Europe and in the United States shortly after, though many were not as elaborate as Robertson's.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===United States===
Phantasmagoria came to the United States in May 1803 at Mount Vernon Garden, New York. Much like the French Revolution sparked interest in phantasmagoria in France, the expanding frontier in the United States made for an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear that was ideal for phantasmagoria shows.&lt;ref name="Barber" /&gt; Many others created phantasmagoria shows in the United States over the next couple of years, including Martin Aubée, one of Robertson's former assistants.

===Further history===
Thomas Young proposed a system that could keep the projected image in focus for a lantern on a small cart with rods adjusting the position of the lens when the cart was wheeled closer or further away from the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=yf2oGn1oS7YC&amp;dq=%22thomas%20young%22%20phantasmagoria&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q=%22thomas%20young%22%20phantasmagoria&amp;f=false|pages=160–161|title=Letter on Natural Magic|last=Brewster|first=David|year=1843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Evelyn Barlas]] was an English poet who had written for several phantasmagoria shows during the late 1880s. He used the pseudonym ''Evelyn Douglas'' for most of the works written for phantasmagoria.&lt;ref name="Douglas, Evelyn 1887"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Phantasmagoria|last = Douglas|first = Evelyn|publisher = J.H. Clarke|year = 1887|isbn = |location = Chelmsford|page = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written several different works, most of them focusing on the idea of dreams and nightmares. Some of his works include ''Dreamland, A Dream of China, ''and ''Dream Music''.&lt;ref name="Douglas, Evelyn 1887"/&gt; His work is known for including extravagant descriptions of settings with multiple colors.  Most of Barlas' work also mentions flames and fire. The flames are meant to represent the burning of emotions laced throughout Barlas' poems, and fit well within the realm of phantasmagoria.

By the 1840s phantasmagoria became already outmoded, though the use of projections was still employed, just in different realms:

{{quotation|...although the phantasmagoria was an essentially live form of entertainment these shows also used projectors in ways which anticipated 20th century film-camera movements—the 'zoom', 'dissolve', the 'tracking-shot' and superimposition.|[[Mervyn Heard]]}}

==In other media==
Before the rise of phantasmagoria, interest in the fantastic was apparent in ghost stories. This can be seen in the many examples of ghost stories printed in the 18th century, including "Admiral Vernon's ghost; being a full true and particular Account as how a Warlike apparition appeared last Week to the Author, Clad all in Scarlet, And discoursed to him concerning the Present State of Affairs". In this tale, the author's reaction to the ghost he sees is much like that of the audience members at the phantasmagoria shows. He says that he is "thunderstruck", and that "astonishment seized me. My bones shivered within me. My flesh trembled over me. My lips quaked. My mouth opened. My hands expanded. My knees knocked together. My blood grew chilly, and I froze with terror&lt;ref&gt;"Admiral Vernon's ghost; being a full true and particular Account as how a Warlike apparition appeared last Week to the Author, Clad all in Scarlet, And discoursed to him concerning the Present State of Affairs" Printed for E. Smith, Holborn (1758): 1–8. Print."&lt;/ref&gt;

French painters of the time, including [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] and [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]], derived ideas for paintings from the phantasmagoria, and its influence spread as far as [[J. M. W. Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Charlesworth, ''Landscape and Vision in 19th century Britain and France'' (Ashgate, 2008), Chapter Two, "Ghosts and Visions".&lt;/ref&gt;

Early stop trick films developed by [[Georges Méliès]] most clearly parallel the early forms of phantasmagoria. Trick films include transformations, superimpositions, disappearances, rear projections, and the frequent appearance of ghosts and apparent decapitations.&lt;ref&gt;"Overview of Edison Motion Pictures by Genre". ''The Library of Congress''. The Library of Congress, 13 Jan 1999. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern day horror films often take up many of the techniques and motifs of stop trick films, and phantasmagoria is said to have survived in this new form.

[[Maria Jane Jewsbury]] produced a volume entitled ''Phantasmagoria, or Sketches of Life and Literature'', published by Hurst Robinson &amp; Co, in 1825. This consists of a number of essays on various subjects together with poetry. The whole is dedicated to William Wordsworth.

''[[Phantasmagoria (poem)|Phantasmagoria]]'' is also the title of a poem in seven cantos by [[Lewis Carroll]] that was published by Macmillan &amp; Sons in London in 1869, about which Carroll had much to say. He preferred that the title of the volume be found at the back, saying in a correspondence with Macmillan, "it is picturesque and fantastic—but that is about the only thing I like…" He also wished that the volume would cost less, thinking that the 6 shillings was about 1 shilling too much to charge.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Morton N. "Lewis Carroll and the House of Macmillan". ''Cambridge University Press'' 7 (1979):31–70. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern times==
A few modern theatrical troupes in the United States and United Kingdom stage phantasmagoria projection shows, especially at [[Halloween]].

The 1995 survival-horror video game ''[[Phantasmagoria (video game)|Phantasmagoria]]'' is partly based upon these performances. In the game, several flashbacks are shown to fictional phantasmagorias performed by the magician "Carno". However, unlike the real shows, his are much more graphic and violent in nature.

[[Walter Benjamin]] was fascinated by the phantasmagoria and used it as a term to describe the experience of the [[Arcade (architecture)|Arcades]] in [[Paris]]. In his essays, he associated phantasmagoria with commodity culture and its experience of material and intellectual products. In this way, Benjamin expanded upon Marx's statement on the phantasmagorical powers of the commodity.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Margaret. "Walter Benjamin's Phantasmagoria." ''New German Critique'' 48 (1989): 87–107. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phantasmagoria's influence on [[Disney]] can be found in the countless effects throughout the themed lands and attractions at the theme parks but are likely most memorable in the practical and projection effects of the [[Haunted Mansion]] (at [[Disneyland]], [[Walt Disney World]] and Tokyo Disneyland), and Phantom Manor (at Disneyland Paris), as well live shows such as ''[[Fantasmic]]'' (at [[Disneyland]] and [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]), which feature film/video projections on water screens.

From February 15 to May 1, 2006, the [[Tate Britain]] staged "The Phantasmagoria" as a component of its show "Gothic Nightmares: [[Fuseli]], [[Blake]] and the Romantic Imagination."  It recreated the content of the 18th and 19th century presentations, and successfully evoked their tastes for horror and fantasy.

A series of photographs taken from 1977 to 1987 by photographer and model [[Cindy Sherman]] are described as portraying the phantasmagoria of the female body. Her photographs include herself as the model, and the progression of the series as a whole presents the phantasmagoric space projected both onto and into the female body.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvey, Laura. "A Phantasmagoria of the Female Body: The Work of Cindy Sherman." ''New Left Review'' I.188 (July–August 1991): 137–150. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, David J. Jones discovered the precise site of Robertson's show at the Capuchin convent. See David J. Jones, 'Gothic Machine: Textualities, Pre-Cinematic Media and Film in 
Popular Visual Culture', 1670-1910 (Cardiff: University of Wales).

'''Political philosophy''', also known as '''political theory''', is the study of topics such as [[politics]], [[liberty]], [[justice]], [[property]], [[rights]], [[law]], and the enforcement of laws by [[authority]]: what they are, why (or even if) they are needed, what, if anything, makes a [[The purpose of government|government legitimate]], what rights and freedoms it should protect and why, what form it should take and why, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever.

In a [[vernacular]] sense, the term "political philosophy" often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics, synonymous to the term "[[political ideology]]".

Political philosophy is a branch of [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Leo (1959). An introduction to Political Philosophy. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[political science]], a strong focus has historically been placed on the role of political philosophy (also known as [[normative theory]]), [[moral philosophy]] and the [[humanities]], although in recent years there has been increased focus to political theory based on [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] methodological approaches as well as [[economic theory]], the [[natural sciences]] and [[behaviouralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Savigny |first1=Heather |last2=Marsden |first2=Lee |title=Doing Political Science and International Relations: Theories in Action |date=2011 |publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education |isbn=9780230344136 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaUcBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient traditions ===

==== Ancient India ====
[[Indian political philosophy]]  in ancient times demarcated a clear distinction between (1) nation and state (2) religion and state. The constitutions of Hindu states evolved over time and were based on political and legal treatises and prevalent social institutions. The institutions of state were broadly divided into governance, administration, defense, law and order. ''Mantranga,'' the principal governing body of these states, consisted of the King, Prime Minister, Commander in chief of army, Chief Priest of the King. The Prime Minister headed the committee of ministers along with head of executive (Maha Amatya).

[[Chanakya]] was a 4th-century BC Indian political philosopher. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'' provides an account of the science of politics for a wise ruler, policies for foreign affairs and wars, the system of a spy state and surveillance and economic stability of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Roger Boesche|last=Boesche|first=Roger|title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K85NA7Rg67wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0739106074&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2002|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0-7391-0401-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanakya quotes several authorities including Bruhaspati, Ushanas, Prachetasa Manu, Parasara, and Ambi, and described himself as a descendant of a lineage of political philosophers, with his father Chanaka being his immediate predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangarajan|first1=L N|title=The Arthashastra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jbzZkoR36QC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9788184750119|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influential extant Indian treatise on political philosophy is the Sukra Neeti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=D.

Sewell and J. Debrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ancient China ====
Chinese political philosophy dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn period]], specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn period and the [[Warring States period]]. The major philosophies during the period, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Mohism]], [[School of Agrarianism|Agrarianism]] and [[Taoism]], each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], and [[Mozi]], focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly [[authoritarian]] government based on [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] punishments and laws. [[Mohism]] advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on [[frugality]] and [[ascetism]]. The Agrarians advocated a peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deutsch|first=Eliot|author2=Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999|page=183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taoism advocated a proto-[[anarchism]]. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the [[Qin Dynasty]], but was replaced by State Confucianism in the [[Han Dynasty]]. Prior to China's adoption of [[communism]], State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsü|first=Leonard Shihlien|title=The political philosophy of Confucianism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FWFtQIyun-8C|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-36154-5|pages=xvii–xx|quote=The importance of a scientific study of Confucian political philosophy could hardly be overstated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ancient Greece ====
Western political philosophy originates in the philosophy of [[ancient Greece]], where political philosophy dates back to at least Plato.&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahakian|first=Mabel Lewis|title=Ideas of the great philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vi7cQMw8SwYC&amp;pg=PA59|year=1993|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2|page=59|quote=... Western philosophical tradition can be traced back as early as Plato (427–347 BC).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greece was dominated by city-states, which experimented with various forms of political organization, grouped by Plato into five categories of descending stability and morality: [[monarchy]], [[timocracy]],[[oligarchy]], [[democracy]] and [[tyranny]]. One of the first, extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Plato's ''Republic'',&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"/&gt; which was followed by [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraut|first=Richard|title=Aristotle: political philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9BDmX3FBbS4C&amp;pg=PA3|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-878200-1|page=3|quote=To understand and assess Aristotle's contributions to political thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman political philosophy was influenced by the [[Stoics]] and the Roman statesman [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radford|first=Robert T.|title=Cicero: a study in the origins of republican philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1cKLGcvuYxQC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2002|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1467-1|page=1|quote=His most lasting political contribution is in his work on political philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saint Augustine ====

The early [[Christian philosophy]] of [[Augustine of Hippo]] was heavily influenced by Plato. A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderation of the [[Stoicism]] and theory of [[justice]] of the Roman world, as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying [[mercy]] as a [[moral example]]. Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the [[City of God (book)|City of God]] (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man ([[Civitas]] Terrena). Augustine's ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schall|first=James V.|title=At the Limits of Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yZK79kiFFtsC&amp;pg=PA40|year=1998|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-0922-7|page=40|quote=In political philosophy, St. Augustine was a follower of Plato ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== St. Thomas Aquinas ====
{{main|Treatise on Law}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] meticulously dealt with the varieties of [[philosophy of law|law]]. According to Aquinas, there are four kinds of law:

# Eternal law ("the divine government of everything")
# Divine positive law (having been "posited" by God; external to human nature)
# [[Natural law]] (the right way of living discoverable by natural reason; what cannot-not be known; internal to human nature)
# Human law (what we commonly call "[[law]]"—including [[customary law]]; the law of the ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'')

Aquinas never discusses the nature or categorization of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]. There is scholarly debate surrounding the place of canon law within the Thomistic jurisprudential framework.

Aquinas was an incredibly influential thinker in the [[Natural law|Natural Law tradition]].

The rise of [[Islam]], based on both the [[Qur'an]] and [[Muhammad]] strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. [[Early Islamic philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between [[science]] and [[religion]], and the process of [[ijtihad]] to find [[truth]]—in effect ''all'' philosophy was "[[Political aspects of Islam|political]]" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the "rationalist" [[Mutazilite]] philosophers, who held a more [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenic]] view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first [[speculative philosophy|speculative]] theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the [[Caliphate]]. By the late ancient period, however, the "traditionalist" [[Asharite]] view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aslan|first=Reza|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title=No god but God|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AkyupJn81RMC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2005|publisher=Random House Inc.|isbn=978-1-58836-445-6|page=153|quote=By the ninth and tenth centuries... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic philosophy|Islamic political philosophy]], was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of [[Islam]]—i.e., the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[al-Farabi]] (Abunaser), [[Avicenna|İbn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace) and [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes). The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), [[sultan]], [[ummah]], cemaa (obligation)-and even the "core" terms of the Qur'an—i.e., [[ibadah]] (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and [[ilah]] (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other [[Fiqh|jurists]] and [[Ulema|ulama]] posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the [[Kharijites|Khawarij]] in the very early years of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] on [[Caliphate|Khilafa]] and [[Ummah]], or that of [[Shia Islam]] on the concept of [[Imamah]] are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the [[Sunni Islam|Ehl-i Sunna]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character. Political thought was not purely rooted in theism, however. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotleanism]] flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the [[Peripatetic school|peripaetic]] philosophers who implemented the ideas of [[Aristotle]] in the context of the Islamic world. Abunaser, Avicenna and Ibn Rushd where part of this philosophical school who claimed that human reason surpassed mere coincidence and revelation. They believed, for example, that natural phenomena occurs because of certain rules (made by god), not because god interfered directly (unlike Al-Ghazali and his followers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Farabi|title=Al-Fārābī {{!}} Muslim philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/#H5|title=Avicenna (Ibn Sina) {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-22|title=Averroes|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Averroes&amp;oldid=837663527|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Ghazali|title=Al-Ghazālī {{!}} Muslim jurist, theologian, and mystic|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable political philosophers of the time include [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a Persian scholar and [[vizier]] of the Seljuq Empire who composed the ''[[Siyasatnama]]'', or the "Book of Government" in English. In it, he details the role of the state in terms of political affairs (i.e. how to deal with political opponents without ruining the government's image), as well as its duty to protect the poor and reward the worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-30|title=Siyasatnama|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Siyasatnama&amp;oldid=788295179|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his other work, he explains how the state should deal with other issues such as supplying jobs to immigrants like the [[Turkmens]] who were coming from the north (present day southern Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nizam-al-Mulk-Seljuq-vizier|title=Niẓām al-Mulk {{!}} Seljuq vizier|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ibn Khaldun ====

The 14th-century [[Arab]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist [[Ernest Gellner]] considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of [[government]], "...an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself," the best in the history of political theory. For Ibn Khaldun, government should be restrained to a minimum for as a necessary evil, it is the constraint of men by other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gellner|first=Ernest|authorlink=Ernest Gellner|title=Plough, Sword, and Book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WwduQjFiB7kC&amp;pg=PA239|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-28702-7|page=239|quote=Ibn Khaldun's definition of government probably remains the best: ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Europe ===
[[Medieval]] political philosophy in [[Europe]] was heavily influenced by [[Christian]] thinking. It had much in common with the Mutazilite [[Islamic]] thinking in that the [[Roman Catholic]]s though subordinating [[philosophy]] to [[theology]] did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions, subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam. The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koetsier|first=L. S.|title=Natural Law and Calvinist Political Theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7uLE3DynB0YC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2004|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4122-1440-7|page=19|quote=...the Medieval Scholastics revived the concept of natural law. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] who helped reintroduce [[Aristotle]]'s works, which had only been transmitted to [[Catholic]] [[Europe]] through [[Muslim]] [[Spain]], along with the commentaries of [[Averroes]]. Aquinas's use of them set the agenda, for [[scholasticism|scholastic]] political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA346|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|page=346|quote=There was, however, at least one department of thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval political philosophers, such as Aquinas in ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', developed the idea that a king who is a tyrant is no king at all and could be overthrown.

[[Magna Carta]], viewed by many as a cornerstone of Anglo-American political liberty, explicitly proposes the right to revolt against the ruler for justice sake. Other documents similar to Magna Carta are found in other European countries such as Spain and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valente|first=Claire|title=The theory and practice of revolt in medieval England|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8yRrtm0LicC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0901-8|page=14|quote=The two starting points of most medieval discussions ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Renaissance ===
During the [[Renaissance]] secular political philosophy began to emerge after about a century of theological political thought in Europe. While the Middle Ages did see secular politics in practice under the rule of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the academic field was wholly [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and therefore Christian in nature.

==== Niccolò Machiavelli ====

One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'', written between 1511–12 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's death. That work, as well as ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio|The Discourses]]'', a rigorous analysis of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Ian|title=Lecture on Machiavelli's The Prince|publisher=[[Malaspina University College]]|date=February 2002|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/introser/machiavelli.htm|accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the [[Republic of Florence]] rather than the [[oligarchy]] of the di [[Medici]] family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] and somewhat [[consequentialist]] view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the secure and powerful state. [[Thomas Hobbes]], well known for his theory of the [[social contract]], goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the [[English Renaissance]]. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA310|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|pages=310–12|quote=...we witness the growth of political absolutism ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Enlightenment ===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|right|upright=1.45|thumb|Eugène Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830, Louvre), a painting created at a time when old and modern political philosophies came into violent conflict.]]During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, new theories about what the human was and is and about the definition of reality and the way it was perceived, along with the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies (especially in the wake of the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]]), and the [[Haitian Revolution]] led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of "state" and "government." It was decided that "state" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term "government" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in [[political science]], although some political scientists, philosophers, [[history|historians]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of [[natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] was not introduced, the [[social sciences]] could not evolve independently of [[theistic]] thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barens|first1=Ingo|last2=Caspari|first2=Volker|last3=Schefold|first3=Bertram|editor1-last=Barens|editor1-first=Ingo|others=Volker Caspari ed., Bertram Schefold ed.|title=Political events and economic ideas|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x6C5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA206|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-152-6|pages=206–07|quote=Economic theory as political philosophy: the example of the French Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the [[guild]] was subordinated to the theory of [[free trade]], and [[Roman Catholic]] dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by [[Protestant]] churches subordinate to each [[nation-state]], which also (in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region. However, the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion, particularly Christianity. The most outspoken critic of the church in France was [[François Marie Arouet de Voltaire]], a representative figure of the enlightenment. After Voltaire, religion would never be the same again in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=James M.|title=Religion and the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FcEy8SF63TgC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1997|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25760-6|pages=1–2|quote=... there emerged groups of freethinkers intent on grounding knowledge on the exercise of critical reason, as opposed to ... established religion ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later. As well, there was no spread of this doctrine within the [[New World]] and the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Inca]], [[Mohican]], [[Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and especially the [[Iroquois]]. The [[Iroquois]] philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the [[United States]]: for example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a great admirer of some of the methods of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johansen|first=Bruce Elliott|title=Native American political systems and the evolution of democracy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H593mgxQNu4C&amp;pg=PA69|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30010-3|page=69|quote=... the three-tier system of federalism ... is an inheritance of Iroquois inspiration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== John Locke ====

[[John Locke]] in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir [[Robert Filmer]]'s paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the [[divine right of kings]] became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from [[original sin]], Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as [[tabula rasa]]. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.

=== Industrialization and the Modern Era ===
The [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] critique of capitalism—developed with [[Friedrich Engels]]—was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth century. The [[industrial revolution]] produced a parallel revolution in political thought. [[Urbanization]] and [[capitalism]] greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the [[History of Socialism|socialist movement]] began to form. In the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] was developed, and [[socialism]] in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Fidel Castro]]. Though [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s philosophy of history is similar to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s, and [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was "standing on its head", "the right side up again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm|title=Capital Volume One, Afterword to the Second German Edition|last=Marx|first=Karl|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Marx who believed in [[historical materialism]], Hegel believed in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kain|first=Philip J.|title=Marx and modern political theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kvG8DVBeT9QC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1993|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-7866-2|pages=1–4|quote=Some of his texts, especially the ''Communist Manifesto'' made him seem like a sort of communist Descartes ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]]s were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of [[anarchism]], with thinkers such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] or [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[syndicalism]] also gained some prominence. In the Anglo-American world, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|reason=Pluralism possibly earlier|date=April 2017}}

[[World War I]] was a watershed event in human history, changing views of governments and politics. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] (and similar, albeit less successful, revolutions in many other European countries) brought [[communism]]—and in particular the political theory of [[Leninism]], but also on a smaller level [[Luxemburgism]] (gradually)—on the world stage. At the same time, [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspalter|first=Christian|title=Importance of Christian and Social Democratic movements in welfare politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vouKut-RAYoC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2001|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-56072-975-4|page=70|quote=The pressing need for universal suffrage ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary ==
From the end of [[World War II]] until 1971, when [[John Rawls]] published ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and [[behavioralism]]. In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with [[Marxism]] dominating the field. This was the time of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Althusser]], and the victories of [[Mao Zedong]] in [[China]] and [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]], as well as the events of [[May 1968]] led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the [[New Left]]. A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including [[Karl Popper]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[Judith Shklar]]—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.

[[Communism]] remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Colonialism]] and [[racism]] were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply [[utilitarianism]] to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as [[rational choice theory]]) to political issues. The rise of [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements]] and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as [[African Americans]] and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, [[postcolonial]], and [[multicultural]] thought becoming significant. This led to a challenge to the [[social contract]] by philosophers [[Charles W. Mills]] in his book ''[[The Racial Contract]]'' and [[Carole Pateman]] in her book ''[[The Sexual Contract]]'' that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively.

In Anglo-American academic political philosophy, the publication of [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in 1971 is considered a milestone. Rawls used a [[thought experiment]], the [[original position]], in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice. [[Robert Nozick]]'s 1974 book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', which won a [[National Book Award]], responded to Rawls from a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis Schaefer, [http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia], [[The New York Sun]], April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the [[Frankfurt School]], thinkers like [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on [[structuralism]] and on a "return to [[Hegel]]". Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Claude Lefort]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. The [[Situationist International|Situationists]] were more influenced by Hegel; [[Guy Debord]], in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of [[commodity fetishism]] to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.

Another debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by [[Michael Walzer]], [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. The [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[communitarian]] debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective.These and other communitarians (such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Daniel A. Bell]]) argue that, contra liberalism, communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus. Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of [[social capital]].

A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are [[republicanism]] (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the [[capability approach]]. The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s positive and negative forms of liberty, namely "liberty as non-domination." Unlike the American liberal movement which understands liberty as "non-interference," "non-domination" entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person. To a liberal, a slave who is not interfered with may be free, yet to a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian [[Quentin Skinner]], jurist [[Cass Sunstein]], and political philosopher [[Philip Pettit]]. The capability approach, pioneered by economists [[Mahbub ul Haq]] and [[Amartya Sen]] and further developed by legal scholar [[Martha Nussbaum]], understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act. Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced. In other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it.

Current emphasis on "commoditization of the everyday" has been decried by many contemporary theorists, some of them arguing the full brunt of it would be felt in ten years' time. "Pricing" such ethical categories like personal relations or sex, though always present, pushed by media agenda, is thus seen as crossing boundaries and having adverse societal and philosophical consequences.

A prominent subject in recent political philosophy is the theory of [[deliberative democracy]]. The seminal work was done by Jurgen Habermas in [[Germany]], but the most extensive literature has been in English, led by theorists such as [[Jane Mansbridge]], Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson, ''Democracy and Disagreement'' (Princeton University Press, 1996). Also see Gutmann and Thompson, ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' (Princeton University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influential political philosophers ==
A larger [[list of political philosophers]] is intended to be closer to exhaustive. Listed below are some of the most [[Archetype|canonical]] or important thinkers, and especially philosophers whose central focus was in political philosophy and/or who are good representatives of a particular school of thought.
* [[Thomas Aquinas]]: In synthesizing Christian theology and Peripatetic (Aristotelian) teaching in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]'', Aquinas contends that God's gift of higher reason—manifest in human law by way of the divine virtues—gives way to the assembly of righteous government.
* [[Aristotle]]: Wrote his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' as an extension of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Notable for the theories that humans are social animals, and that the [[polis]] (Ancient Greek city state) existed to bring about the good life appropriate to such animals. His political theory is based upon an ethics of [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]] (as is [[Marx]]'s, on some readings).
* [[Mikhail Bakunin]]: After [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], Bakunin became the most important political philosopher of [[anarchism]]. His specific version of anarchism is called [[collectivist anarchism]].
* [[Jeremy Bentham]]: The first thinker to analyze social justice in terms of maximization of aggregate individual benefits. Founded the philosophical/ethical school of thought known as [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Isaiah Berlin]]: Developed the distinction between positive and negative liberty.
* [[Edmund Burke]]: Irish member of the British parliament, Burke is credited with the creation of conservative thought. Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' is the most popular of his writings where he denounced the French revolution. Burke was one of the biggest supporters of the American Revolution.
* [[Confucius]]: The first thinker to relate ethics to the political order.
* [[William E. Connolly]]: Helped introduce postmodern philosophy into political theory, and promoted new theories of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]] and [[agonistic democracy]].
* [[John Dewey]]: Co-founder of [[pragmatism]] and analyzed the essential role of education in the maintenance of democratic government.
* [[Han Feizi]]: The major figure of the Chinese Fajia ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]) school, advocated government that adhered to laws and a strict method of administration.
* [[Michel Foucault]]: Critiqued the modern conception of power on the basis of the [[prison–industrial complex|prison complex]] and other prohibitive institutions, such as those that designate sexuality, madness and knowledge as the roots of their infrastructure, a critique that demonstrated that subjection is the power formation of subjects in any linguistic forum and that revolution cannot just be thought as the reversal of power between classes.
* [[Antonio Gramsci]]: Instigated the concept of ''[[hegemony]]''. Argued that the [[Sovereign state|state]] and the ruling class uses [[culture]] and [[ideology]] to gain the consent of the classes it rules over.
* [[Thomas Hill Green]]: Modern liberal thinker and early supporter of [[positive freedom]].
* [[Jürgen Habermas]]: Contemporary democratic theorist and sociologist. He has pioneered such concepts as the [[public sphere]], [[communicative action]], and [[deliberative democracy]]. His early work was heavily influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]].
* [[Friedrich Hayek]]: He argued that central planning was inefficient because members of central bodies could not know enough to match the preferences of consumers and workers with existing conditions. Hayek further argued that [[command economy|central economic planning]]—a mainstay of socialism—would lead to a "total" state with dangerous power. He advocated [[free-market]] capitalism in which the main role of the state is to maintain the [[rule of law]] and let spontaneous order develop.
* [[G. W. F. Hegel]]: Emphasized the "cunning" of history, arguing that it followed a rational trajectory, even while embodying seemingly irrational forces; influenced Marx, [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Michael Oakeshott|Oakeshott]].
* [[Thomas Hobbes]]: Generally considered to have first articulated how the concept of a [[social contract]] that justifies the actions of rulers (even where contrary to the individual desires of governed citizens), can be reconciled with a conception of sovereignty.
* [[David Hume]]: Hume criticized the social contract theory of John Locke and others as resting on a myth of some actual agreement. Hume was a realist in recognizing the role of force to forge the existence of states and that [[consent of the governed]] was merely hypothetical. He also introduced the concept of [[utility]], later picked up on and developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]].
* [[Thomas Jefferson]]: Politician and political theorist during the [[American Enlightenment]]. Expanded on the philosophy of Thomas Paine by instrumenting [[republicanism]] in the United States. Most famous for the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].
* [[Immanuel Kant]]: Argued that participation in civil society is undertaken not for self-preservation, as per [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], but as a moral duty. First modern thinker who fully analyzed structure and meaning of obligation. Argued that an international organization was needed to preserve world peace.
* [[Peter Kropotkin]]: One of the classic anarchist thinkers and the most influential theorist of [[anarcho-communism]].
* [[John Locke]]: Like Hobbes, described a social contract theory based on citizens' fundamental rights in the [[state of nature]]. He departed from Hobbes in that, based on the assumption of a society in which moral values are independent of governmental authority and widely shared, he argued for a government with power limited to the protection of personal property. His arguments may have been deeply influential to the formation of the [[United States Constitution]].
* [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]: First systematic analyses of: (1) how consent of a populace is negotiated between and among rulers rather than simply a naturalistic (or theological) given of the structure of society; (2) precursor to the concept of ideology in articulating the epistemological structure of commands and law.
* [[James Madison]]: American politician and protege of Jefferson considered to be "Father of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]" and "Father of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]" of the United States. As a political theorist, he believed in [[separation of powers]] and proposed a comprehensive set of [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]] that are necessary to protect the rights of an individual from the [[tyranny of the majority]].
* [[Herbert Marcuse]]: Called the father of the [[new left]]. One of the principal thinkers within the [[Frankfurt School]], and generally important in efforts to fuse the thought of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Introduced the concept of "[[repressive desublimation]]", in which social control can operate not only by direct control, but also by manipulation of desire. His work [[Eros and Civilization]] and notion of a non-repressive society was influential on the 1960s and its counter-cultural social movements.
* [[Karl Marx]]: In large part, added the historical dimension to an understanding of society, culture and economics. Created the concept of ''ideology'' in the sense of (true or false) beliefs that shape and control social actions. Analyzed the fundamental nature of class as a mechanism of governance and social interaction. Profoundly influenced world politics with his theory of communism.
* [[Mencius]]: One of the most important thinkers in the Confucian school, he is the first theorist to make a coherent argument for an obligation of rulers to the ruled.
* [[John Stuart Mill]]: A [[utilitarian]], and the person who named the system; he goes further than Bentham by laying the foundation for liberal democratic thought in general and modern, as opposed to classical, liberalism in particular. Articulated the place of individual liberty in an otherwise utilitarian framework.
* [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]: Analyzed protection of the people by a "balance of powers" in the divisions of a state.
* [[John Rawls]]: Revitalized the study of normative political philosophy in Anglo-American universities with his 1971 book [[A Theory of Justice]], which uses a version of [[social contract theory]] to answer fundamental questions about [[justice]] and to criticise [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Mozi]]: Eponymous founder of the Mohist school, advocated a form of [[Mohist consequentialism|consequentialism]].
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]: Philosopher who became a powerful influence on a broad spectrum of 20th-century political currents in [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], and [[conservatism]]. His interpreters have debated the content of his political philosophy.
* [[Robert Nozick]]: Criticized Rawls, and argued for [[libertarianism]], by appeal to a hypothetical history of the [[State (polity)|state]] and of [[property]].
* [[Thomas Paine]]: [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer who defended [[liberal democracy]], the [[American Revolution]], and [[French Revolution]] in ''[[Common Sense]]'' and The ''[[Rights of Man]]''.
* [[Plato]]: Wrote a lengthy dialog ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' in which he laid out his political philosophy: citizens should be divided into three categories. One category of people are the rulers: they should be philosophers, according to Plato, this idea is based on his [[Theory of Forms]].
* [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]: Commonly considered the father of modern [[anarchism]], specifically [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].
* [[Ayn Rand]]: Founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and prime mover of the Objectivist and Libertarian movements in mid-twentieth-century America. Advocated a complete, laissez-faire capitalism. Rand held that the proper role of government was exclusively the protection of individual rights without economic interference. The government was to be separated from economics the same way and for the same reasons it was separated from religion. Any governmental action not directed at the defense of individual rights would constitute the initiation of force (or threat of force), and therefore a violation not only of rights but also of the legitimate function of government.
* [[Murray Rothbard]]: The central theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]] and an [[Austrian School]] economist.
* [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: Analyzed the social contract as an expression of the [[general will]], and controversially argued in favor of absolute [[democracy]] where the people at large would act as [[Sovereignty|sovereign]].
* [[Carl Schmitt]]: German political theorist, tied to the Nazis, who developed the concepts of the Friend/Enemy Distinction and the State of exception. Though his most influential books were written in the 1920s, he continued to write prolifically until his death (in academic quasi-exile) in 1985. He heavily influenced 20th-century political philosophy both within the Frankfurt School and among others, not all of whom are philosophers, such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Giorgio Agamben]].
* [[Adam Smith]]: Often said to have founded modern [[economics]]; explained emergence of economic benefits from the self-interested behavior ("the invisible hand") of artisans and traders. While praising its efficiency, Smith also expressed concern about the effects of industrial labor (e.g., repetitive activity) on workers. His work on moral sentiments sought to explain social bonds which enhance economic activity.
* [[Socrates]]: Widely considered the founder of Western political philosophy, via his spoken influence on Athenian contemporaries; since Socrates never wrote anything, much of what we know about him and his teachings comes through his most famous student, Plato.
* [[Baruch Spinoza]]: Set forth the first analysis of ''[[rational egoism]]'', in which the rational interest of self is conformance with pure reason. To Spinoza's thinking, in a society in which each individual is guided by reason, political authority would be superfluous.
* [[Max Stirner]]: Important thinker within [[anarchism]] and the main representative of the anarchist current known as [[individualist anarchism]].
* [[Leo Strauss]]: Famously rejected modernity, mostly on the grounds of what he perceived to be modern political philosophy's excessive self-sufficiency of reason and flawed philosophical grounds for moral and political normativity. He argued instead we should return to pre-modern thinkers for answers to contemporary issues. His philosophy was influential on the formation of [[Neo-Conservativism]], and a number of his students later were members of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].
* [[Henry David Thoreau]]: Influential American thinker on such diverse later political positions and topics such as [[pacifism]], [[anarchism]], [[environmentalism]] and [[civil disobedience]] who influenced later important political activists such as [[Martin Luther King]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].
* [[Voltaire|François-Marie Arouet (Voltaire)]]: French Enlightenment writer, poet, and philosopher famous for his advocacy of civil liberties, including freedom of religion and free trade.
* [[Bernard Williams]]: A British moral philosopher whose posthumously published work on political philosophy ''In the Beginning was the Deed'' has been seen—along with the works of [[Raymond Geuss]]—as a key foundational work on political realism.
* [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]: A French political scientist and diplomat, known for his works ''[[Democracy in America]]'' and ''[[The Old Regime and the Revolution]]''.

'''Purism''', referring to the arts, was a movement that took place between 1918 and 1925 that influenced French painting and architecture. Purism was led by [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and [[Le Corbusier|Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier)]]. Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created a variation of the [[Cubism|Cubist]] movement and called it Purism: where objects are represented as elementary forms devoid of detail. The main concepts were presented in their book ''Après le Cubisme'' (After Cubism) published in 1918.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Susan|title=Ozenfant and Purism: The Evolution of a Style 1915–1930|year=1981|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/purism Purism, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post World War I==
[[File:Le Corbusier, 1921, Nature morte, oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, Musée National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|right|Le Corbusier, 1921, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]]]]
Le Corbusier and Ozenfant were the creators of Purism. [[Fernand Léger]] was a principle associate.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt; Purism was an attempt to restore regularity in a war-torn France post World War I.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt; Unlike what they saw as 'decorative' fragmentation of objects in Cubism, Purism proposed a style of painting where elements were represented as robust simplified forms with minimal detail, while embracing technology and the machine.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

Purism culminated in Le Corbusier’s ''Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau'' (Pavilion of the New Spirit), constructed for the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in 1925. This included the work of Cubists [[Juan Gris]] and [[Jacques Lipchitz]]. Following this exhibition the relationship between Le Corbusier and Ozenfant declined.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

==L'Esprit Nouveau==

Ozenfant and Le Corbusier contributed extensively to an art magazine called ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' from 1920 to 1925 serving as a platform for propaganda towards their Purist movement.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliel, Carol S. et al.

==Purist Manifesto==
The Purist Manifesto lays out the rules Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created to govern the Purist movement.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;

* Purism does not intend to be a scientific art, which it is in no sense.
* Cubism has become a decorative art of romantic ornamentism.
* There is a hierarchy in the arts: decorative art is at the base, the human figure at the summit.
* Painting is as good as the intrinsic qualities of its plastic elements, not their representative or narrative possibilities.
* Purism wants to conceive clearly, execute loyally, exactly without deceits; it abandons troubled conceptions, summary or bristling executions. A serious art must banish all techniques not faithful to the real value of the conception.
* Art consists in the conception before anything else.
* Technique is only a tool, humbly at the service of the conception.
* Purism fears the bizarre and the ''original''. It seeks the pure element in order to reconstruct organized paintings that seem to be facts from nature herself. 
* The method must be sure enough not to hinder the conception.
* Purism does not believe that returning to nature signifies the copying of nature.
* It admits all deformation is justified by the search for the invariant.
* All liberties are accepted in art except those that are unclear.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;

The world's largest form of mass religious tourism takes place in India at the Kumbh Mela pilgrimage, which attracts over 100 million pilgrims. North American religious tourists comprise an estimated $10 billion of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/24/AR2007062401422.html Washington Post.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern religious tourists are more able to visit [[Holy city|holy cities]] and holy sites around the world. The most famous holy sites are the [[Great Mosque of Mecca]], the Holy Shrine of Imam Hoseyn in Karbala, the Holy Shrine of Imam Reza in Mashhad, the Holy Shrine of Lady Fatima Masuma in Qom,  the [[Sanctuary of Fátima|Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima]] in [[Cova da Iria]], the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in [[Mexico City]], the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]], the [[Western Wall]] in [[Jerusalem]] and the [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. Religious tourism has existed since antiquity. 

A study in 2011 found that 2.5 million people visited Karbala on the day of Arbaeen in 2013,  [[pilgrim]]s visited [[Jerusalem]] for a few reasons: to understand and appreciate their [[religion]] through a tangible experience, to feel secure about their religious beliefs, and to connect personally to the [[holy city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael Sebastian |last=Metti |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jerusalem - the most powerful brand in history |url=http://www.fek.su.se/en/Research/Subdisciplines/Marketing/Stockholm-Program-of-Place-Branding |work=[[Stockholm University School of Business]] |publisher= |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=1 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110612234127/http://www.fek.su.se/en/Research/Subdisciplines/Marketing/Stockholm-Program-of-Place-Branding |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sash''' is a large and usually colorful [[ribbon]] or band of material worn around the body, draping from one shoulder to the opposing hip, or else running around the waist. The sash around the waist may be worn in daily attire, but the sash from shoulder to hip is worn on ceremonial occasions only. Ceremonial sashes are also found in a V-shaped format, draping from both shoulders to the stomach like a large necklace.

==Aristocratic and civilian use==
[[File:Prince Louis of Orléans, Duke of Nemours by Winterhalter.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours]] wearing a red sash (Legion of Honour) together with his ceremonial military uniform. Date 1840s.]]
In [[Latin America]] and some countries of [[Africa]], a special [[presidential sash]] indicates a [[president]]'s authority. In [[France]] and [[Italy]], sashes, featuring the national flag [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]]s and worn on the right shoulder, are used by public authorities and local officials, such as legislators, in public ceremonial events.

Sashes traditionally form part of formal military attire (compare the sword-belt known as a [[baldric]], and the [[cummerbund]]). Most of the European [[royal families]] wear sashes as a part of their royal (and/or military) [[regalia]]. Some [[order (distinction)|order]]s such as the [[Légion d'honneur]] include sashes as part of the seniormost grades' insignia. Likewise Italian military officers wear light blue sashes over the right shoulder on ceremonial occasions.

==Military use==
[[File:French Foreign Legion dsc06878.jpg|thumb|150px|The sashes of the [[French Foreign Legion]] are blue.]]
Sashes are a distinctive feature of some regiments of the modern French Army for parade dress. They are worn around the waist in either dark blue or red by corps such as the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]], the [[Spahi]]s, the [[Chasseurs d' Afrique]] and the [[Tirailleurs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Galliac|page=88|title=L'Armée francaise|ISBN=978-2-35250-195-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were originally raised in North Africa during the period of French colonial rule. In its traditional Franco-Algerian or zouave form the sash ("ceinture de laine") was four metres in length and forty centimetres in width. In the historic [[Army of Africa (France)|French Army of Africa]], sashes were worn around the waist in either blue for European or red for indigenous troops.&lt;ref&gt;André Jouineau, pages 45-63, "The French Army in 1914", {{ISBN|978-2-352-50104-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sashvanda.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Elaborately emboroidered sash from 1635-1642.]] 
At the time of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65) silk sashes in crimson were authorized for officers and red woolen sashes for non-commissioned officers of the regular [[US Army]] (''Army Regulations of 1861''). US Generals continued to wear buff silk sashes in full dress until 1917. In the [[Confederate Army]], sash colour indicated the corps or status of the wearer.  For example: gold for cavalry, burgundy for infantry, black for chaplains, red for sergeants, green or blue for medics, and grey or cream for general officers. With the exception of the West Point Band Drum Major, today the West Point cadet officer is the only person in the US Army who wears a sword and sash, the sole guardian of the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Fredrick Todd Col USAR Cadet Gray page 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West Point Band&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[British Army]] retains a scarlet sash for wear in certain orders of dress by sergeants and above serving in [[infantry]] [[regiments]], over the right shoulder to the left hip. A similar crimson silk net sash is worn around the waist by officers of the [[Foot Guards]] in scarlet full dress and officers of line infantry in dark blue "Number 1" dress. The same practice is followed in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armies.

The present day armies of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] both make extensive use of waist-sashes for ceremonial wear. The colours vary widely according to regiment or branch and match those of the turbans where worn. Typically two or more colours are incorporated in the sash, in vertical stripes. One end hangs loose at the side and may have an ornamental fringe. The practice of wearing distinctive regimental sashes or cummerbunds goes back to the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;John Gaylor, "Sons of John Company - the Indian and Pakistan Armies", {{ISBN|0-946771-98-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to those detailed above, several other modern armies retain waist-sashes for wear by officers in ceremonial uniforms. These include the armies of Norway (crimson sashes), Sweden (yellow and blue), Greece (light blue and white), the Netherlands (orange), Portugal (crimson) and Spain (red and gold for generals, light blue for general staff and crimson for infantry officers).&lt;ref&gt;Rinaldo D'Ami, "World Uniforms in Colour - the European Nations", {{ISBN|0-85059-031-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish  [[Regulares]] (infantry descended from colonial regiments formerly recruited in [[Spanish Morocco]]) retain their historic waist-sashes for all ranks in colours that vary according to the unit.&lt;ref&gt;José Bueno, Ejército Español, Uniformes Contemporáneos",{{ISBN|84-7140-186-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1914 waist-sashes in distinctive national colours were worn as a peace-time mark of rank by officers of the Imperial German, Austro-Hungarian and Russian armies, amongst others. Japanese officers continued the practice in full dress uniform until 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Ritta Nakanishi, "Japanese Military Uniforms 1930-1945, 1991 Dai Nippon Kaiga&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-belts resembling sashes are worn by Drum Majors in the Dutch, British and some Commonwealth armies. These carry scrolls bearing the names of battle honours.

==Modern civilian and cultural use==
[[File:Miss World 07 ZiLin Zhang.jpg|thumb|160px|Winner of a [[beauty pageant]] wearing two sashes]]
[[File:President_Bouterse.JPG|thumb|160px|[[Dési Bouterse|President of Republic of Suriname]] wearing a ceremonial V-style sash]]

In the [[United States]], the sash has picked up a more ceremonial and less practical purpose. Sashes are used at higher education [[commencement ceremony|commencement ceremonies]], by [[high school]] homecoming parade nominees, in [[beauty pageant]]s, as well as by corporations to acknowledge high achievement.

In [[Canada]], hand-woven sashes (called ''[[Ceinture fléchée|ceintures fléchées]]'' and sometimes "L'Assomption sash" after a town in which they were mass-produced) were derived from [[Iroquois|Iroquoiuan]] carrying belts sometime in the 18th century. As a powerful multi-use tool this sash found use in the [[fur trade]] which brought it into the North West. In this period the weave got tighter and size expanded, with some examples more than four metres in length. Coloured thread was widely used. Today it is considered to be primarily a symbol of the 1837 [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] Patriotes and the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] peoples.

In [[Ireland]], especially [[Northern Ireland]], the sash is a symbol of the [[Orange Order]]. Orange Order sashes were originally of the ceremonial shoulder-to-hip variety as worn by the British military. Over the 20th century the sash has been mostly replaced by V-shaped collarettes, which are still generally referred to as sashes. The item is celebrated in the song '[[The Sash my Father Wore]]'.

Sashes are also worn by Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts and Beauty Pageant Participants.  Badges are sewn onto the sash, to indicate achievements of the Scout.

Sashes are part of the [[diplomatic uniform]] of many countries.

Many modern schools of Chinese martial arts use sashes of various colors to denote rank as a reflection of the Japanese ranking system using belts.

The Japanese equivalent of a sash, ''[[obi (sash)|obi]]'', serves to hold a [[kimono]] or [[yukata]] together.

== Honorific orders ==
Sashes are indicative of holding the class of [[Grand Cross]] or Grand Cordon in a [[chivalric order]] or an [[order of merit]]. The sash is usually worn from the right shoulder to the left hip. A few orders do the contrary, according to their traditional statute.

A '''school shooting''' is an attack at an [[educational institution]], such as a school or university, involving the use of a firearm(s). Incidents that involve four or more deaths are also categorized as mass shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vossekuil|first1=Bryan|title=The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School Initiative|date=2004|publisher=United States Secret Service|location=Washington, DC|page=4|url=http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/preventingattacksreport.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/51429-mass-shootings-are-contagious.html|title=Mass Shootings Are Contagious|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to studies, factors behind school shooting include family dysfunction, lack of family supervision, and mental illness. Among the topmost motives of attackers were: bullying/persecution/threatened (75%) and revenge (61%), while 54% reported having numerous reasons.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&amp;did=727626|title=School Shooter: A Quick Reference Guide|last=|first=|publisher=United States. Federal Bureau of Investigation National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crimes (U.S.)|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining motives included an attempt to solve a problem (34%), suicide or depression (27%), and seeking attention or recognition (24%).

School shootings have sparked a political debate over [[gun violence]], [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance]] policies, and [[gun control]].

The United States has the highest number of [[School shootings in the United States|school-related shootings]].&lt;ref name=quartz20121214&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qz.com/37015/how-school-killings-in-the-us-stack-up-against-36-other-countries-put-together/ |title=How school killings in the US stack up against 36 other countries put together |first1=Simone |last1=Foxman |first2=Ritchie |last2=King |date=December 14, 2012 |accessdate=May 19, 2018 |publisher=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |agency=[[Atlantic Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=postmedia20121214&gt;{{cite news |url=http://o.canada.com/news/politics-and-the-nation/crime-and-justice/interactive-mass-shootings-around-the-world-since-1996 |title=Interactive: School shootings around the world since 1996 |first=William |last=Wolfe-Wylie |date=December 14, 2012 |publisher=[[Postmedia Network]] |accessdate=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profiling==
The results from the study indicated that perpetrators came from varying backgrounds, making a singular profile difficult when identifying possible assailant.&lt;ref name=":07"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/preventingattacksreport.pdf|title=The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School Initiative: Implications for the Prevention of School Attacks in the United States|last1=Vossekuil|first1=Bryan|last2=Fein|first2=Robert|last3=Reddy|first3=Marisa|last4=Borum|first4=Randy|last5=Modzeleski|first5=William|date=2004|publisher=United States Secret Service and United States Department of Education|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/preventingattacksreport.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School Initiative |date=May 1, 2002 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some perpetrators were children of divorce, lived in foster homes, or came from intact nuclear families. The majority of individuals had rarely or never gotten into trouble at school and had a healthy social life. Some experts such as [[Alan Lipman]] have warned against the dearth of empirical validity of profiling methods.

===Family dynamics===
One assumption into the catalytic causes of school shootings comes from the "non-traditional" household perspective, which focuses on how family structure and family stability are related to child outcomes.&lt;ref name="Marriage and Child Wellbeing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3091824/|title=Marriage and Child Wellbeing|date=Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, proponents of this hypothesis claim that family structures such as single mothers,&lt;ref name="Catholic Perspectives on Parenting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/marriage-and-family/children/children.cfm|title=Catholic Perspectives on Parenting|date=Dec 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; same-sex parents,&lt;ref name="SBC Statement Opposing Same-Sex Marriage"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ajc.com/news/local/southern-baptist-convention-statement-opposing-same-sex-marriage/jWpZVowPgfuE3Hx1lWABGM/|title=SBC Statement Opposing Same-Sex Marriage|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; extended family, or cohabitation&lt;ref name="Adolescent Well‐Being in Cohabiting, Married, and Single‐Parent Families"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00876.x|title=Adolescent Well‐Being in Cohabiting, Married, and Single‐Parent Families|date=Feb 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; are more harmful to the development of a child's mental well-being, than heterosexual, married parents (often equated with the idea of a [[nuclear family]]). This perspective is found to back federal efforts such as the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act]] (PRWORA) of 1996&lt;ref name="PRWORA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aspe.hhs.gov/report/personal-responsibility-and-work-opportunity-reconciliation-act-1996|title=PRWORA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and US federal tax incentives.&lt;ref name="Married Individuals Filing Joint Returns"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irb/2018-10_IRB#RR-2018-06|title=Internal Revenue Bulletin- 2018-10|date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these assumptions on the detrimental effects of "non-traditional" family structures have repeatedly been shown to be false flags, with the true issues lying within socio-economic realities.&lt;ref name="Consequences of Growing Up Poor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.russellsage.org/publications/consequences-growing-poor-1|title=Consequences of Growing Up Poor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Growing Up with a Single Parent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/textver/16.2.a/impact.txt|title=Growing Up with a Single Parent- What Hurts, What Helps|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longitudinal research has shown the robust, positive effects of higher incomes and higher education levels on child well-being and emotional development, which reflects on the family ''stability'', and not family structure.&lt;ref name="IFS Commentary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org|title=Cohabitation, marriage, relationship stability and child outcomes: an update|date= July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, proponents of this hypothesis often cite family statistics for those who commit crimes, but leave out how these compare to other populations, including the general population. For example, a 2009 survey conducted by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA) revealed that substance abuse amongst children raised by single mothers was higher than children raised by their biological parents. However, the percentage of substance abuse amongst children raised by single-mothers was not only remarkably low (5.4%), but also only 1.2% higher than children raised by both their parents.&lt;ref name="National Survey on Drug Use and Health"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|title=National Survey on Drug Use and Health|website=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those rates reveal to be even smaller when compared to other demographics of the same time period. According surveys commissioned by to the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] between 20%-30% of teenagers used/abused illicit substances, a much higher rate than single-mother households.&lt;ref name="Youth Substance Abuse, NIDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drugabuse.com/library/drug-abuse-statistics/|title=Drug Abuse Statistics, NIDA|date=1997-2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of poorly cited statistics to further this narrative can be found in children who have lost a at least one parent. In the U.S., the rate of parental death before age 16 is 8%. The rate of parental death is disproportionately high for prisoners (30%-50%), however, it is also disproportionately high for high-performing scientists (26%) and US presidents (34%). Harvard's Baker Foundation Professor, Emerita, Dr. Teresa M. Amabile states, "Those kinds of events can crush a child, they can lead to a lot of problems; they can lead to substance abuse, they can lead to various forms of emotional illness. They can also lead to incredible resilience and almost superhuman behaviors, seemingly, if people can come through those experiences intact. I don’t know if we — we being the field in general — have discovered what the keys are, what makes the difference for kids."&lt;ref name="Creativity in Context"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6409&amp;facInfo=pub|title=Creativity in Context|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding that socio-economic factors have greater effects on child development and emotional stability have led many to argue that single-parent and other non-traditional households should be afforded equivalent incentives by the state, as are afforded married households, and that focussing on family structure rather than family stability derails efforts to understand the realities of mass-shooters.

===Parental supervision===
“Studies have found that within offenders’ families, there is frequently a lack of supervision, low emotional closeness, and intimacy”.&lt;ref name="GWPD_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerard|first1=F.J.|last2=Whitefield|first2=K.C.|last3=Porter|first3=L.E.|last4=Browne|first4=K.D.|title=Offender and Offence Characteristics of School Shooting Incidents|journal=Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling|date=2015|volume=13|page=24|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jip.1439|accessdate=27 March 2018|doi=10.1002/jip.1439}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2018 publication, Dr. George S. Everly, Jr, of [[The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] and [[The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] outlined an accumulation of seven, recurring themes that warrant consideration regarding school shooters.&lt;ref name="Profiling School Shooters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/when-disaster-strikes-inside-disaster-psychology/201803/profiling-school-shooters|title=Profiling School Shooters|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor is that school shooters tended to isolate themselves, and "exhibited an obsessive quality that often led to detailed planning, but ironically they seemed to lack an understanding of the consequences of their behavior and thus may have a history of adverse encounters with law enforcement." A criticism in the media of past shooters was questioning how so much planning could commence without alerting the parents or guardians to their efforts. However, this has proven to be as difficult of a question to answer as anticipating any of the past school shootings.

Data from the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], covering decades of US school shootings, reveals that 68% of shooters obtained weapons from their home or the home of a relative. Since 1999, out of 145 US school shootings committed by children/adolescents, 80% of the guns used were taken from their homes or relative's home.&lt;ref name="The gun’s not in the closet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/08/01/feature/school-shootings-should-parents-be-charged-for-failing-to-lock-up-guns-used-by-their-kids/?utm_term=.d69905d1b5a6|title=The gun’s not in the closet|date=Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of firearms has direct effect on the probability of initiating a school shooting. This has led many to question whether parents should be held criminally negligent for their children's gun-related crimes. By 2018, a total of four parents were convicted of failing to lock up the guns that were used to shoot up US schools by their children.&lt;ref name="The gun’s not in the closet"/&gt; Such incidents may also lead to nationwide discussion on gun laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government Vows to Take Action Following Kauhajoki Shootings |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/govt_promises_action_following_kauhajoki_shootings/6112199 |accessdate=September 23, 2008 |work=YLE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[FBI]] offer a guide for helping to identify potential school shooters, The School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective.&lt;ref name="The School Shooter, 1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/stats-services-publications-school-shooter-school-shooter/view|title=The School Shooter|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, it is important to note this document has not been updated since 1999, holds a number of discredited assumptions, yet is still in use today as one of the leading guides on profiling a school shooter. Also note the gendered use of "him" and "his" throughout the 52 page text, assuming the gender of future potential shooters:-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;"Student 'Rules the Roost'"&lt;/strong&gt;
"The parents set few or no limits on the child's conduct, and regularly give in to his demands. The student insists on an inordinate degree of privacy, and parents have little information about his activities, school life, friends, or other relationships. The parents seem intimidated by their child. They may fear he will attack them physically if they confront or frustrate him, or they may be unwilling to face an emotional outburst, or they may be afraid that upsetting the child will spark an emotional crisis. Traditional family roles are reversed: for example, the child acts as if he were the authority figure, while parents act as if they were the children."

&lt;strong&gt;"No Limits or Monitoring of TV and Internet"&lt;/strong&gt;
"Parents do not supervise, limit or monitor the student's television watching or his use of the Internet. The student may have a TV in his own room or is otherwise free without any limits to spend as much time as he likes watching violent or otherwise inappropriate shows. The student spends a great deal fo time watching television rather than in activities with family or friends. Similarly, parents do not monitor computer use or Internet access. The student may know much more about computers than the parents do, and the computer may be considered off limits to the parents while the student is secretive about his computer use, which may involve violent games or Internet research on violence, weapons, or other disturbing subjects."

This last passage includes the archaic notion that violent video games leads to school shootings. The FBI offer three cautions with their guide, 1) No trait or characteristic should be considered in isolation or given more weight than the others, 2) One bad day may not reflect a student's real personality or usual behavior, and 3) Many of these traits and behaviors are seen in adolescents with other, non-violent, issues.
 
[[Daniel Schechter]], Clinical Psychiatrist, wrote that for a baby to develop into a troubled adolescent who then turns lethally violent, a convergence of multiple interacting factors must occur, that is "every bit as complicated...as it is for a tornado to form on a beautiful spring day in Kansas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dana.org/news/cerebrum/detail.aspx?id=30762|title=Forecasting Aggression: Toward a New Interdisciplinary Understanding of What Makes Some Troubled Youth Turn Violent|website=Dana.org|date=Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, reinforcing the issue that school shooters do not necessarily come from "bad" parents. No more than they could come from attentive, educated, negligent, single, married, abusive, or loving parents.

===Younger age===
According to Dr. Jack P. Shonkoff’s study indicates that infants’ brains grow and develop as they interact with the environment. They learn how to function as their needs are met. Infants who do not get responses to their needs or who get abused learn different lessons. The brain’s development can be altered by severe stresses, resulting in a negative impact on the child’s physical, cognitive, emotional, and social growth. Children who have endured these situations as infants often have an underdeveloped cortex, which can lead to increase impulsive behavior, difficulties with tasks that require higher level thinking and feeling. They are also more drawn to taking risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.decodedscience.org/children-prone-violence-brain-development-kids/47858|title=Why Are Some Children More Prone To Violence?

According to [[Adrian Raine|Raine]] (2002), [[Developmental age|immaturity]] is one of many identified factors increasing the likelihood of an individual committing criminal acts of [[violence]] and outbursts of [[aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;Raine, A (2002) - [https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_13840000000000001/attachments/280145/Issue%202-%20Criminal%20Behavior%20Biological.pdf?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Issue%202-%20Criminal%20Behavior%20Biological.pdf%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Issue%25202%252D%2520Criminal%2520Behavior%2520Biological.pdf&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJFNFXH2V2O7RPCAA%2F20180220%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20180220T005116Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=23f428ae1771a265c3e52655a7f89c172460554591678d83000da681f239993e Biological Basis for Crime in Crime: Public Policies for Crime control (J.Q.

Petersilia) - p.23]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ICS Press 2002 Accessed February 20th, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; This fact is supported by findings on [[brain development]] occurring as individuals age from birth.
 
According to the Australian-based ''Raising children network'' and ''Centre for Adolescent Health'' (and a number of other sources&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/10/opinion/a-brain-too-young-for-good-judgment.html], [https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/us1005/6.htm] and [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26158695] Accessed February 20, 2018 (1st shown at an earlier date)&lt;/ref&gt;): the main change occurring in the developing brain during adolescence is the (so-called) ''[[synaptic pruning|pruning]]'' of unused connections in thinking and processing. While this is occurring within the brain, retained connections are strengthened. Synaptic pruning occurs because the [[nervous system]] in humans develops by firstly, the over-producing of parts of the nervous system, [[axons]], [[neurons]], and [[synapses]], to then later in the development of the nervous system, make the superfluous parts redundant, i.e. ''pruning'' (or [[apoptosis]], otherwise known as ''cell death'').&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Irwin - [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-synaptic-pruning-important-for-the-developing-brain/ Why synaptic pruning is important for the developing brain] ''[[Scientific American]]'' Accessed February 15, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; These changes occur in certain parts of the brain firstly; the [[pre-frontal cortex]], the brain location where [[decision-making]] occurs, is the concluding area for development. While the pre-frontal cortex is developing, children and teenagers might possibly rely more on the brain part known as the [[amygdala]]; involving thinking that is more emotionally active, including [[aggression]] and [[impulsiveness]]. As a consequence each individual is more likely to want to make riskier choices, and to do so more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Raising children network, in collaboration with, the Centre for Adolescent Health - [http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/brain_development_teenagers.html Brain development: Teenagers] ''Australian parenting website'' Accessed February 15th, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===School bullying===
Dorothy Espelage of the University of Florida notes that 8 percent of bullying victims become "angry, and aggressively so." She added, "They become very angry, they may act out aggressively online. They may not hit back, but they definitely ruminate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/bullying-role-school-shootings-818753|title=How We Talk about Bullying After School Shootings Can Be Dangerous|last=Swaak|first=Taylor|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bullying is common in schools and seemed to play a role in the lives of many of the school shooters".&lt;ref name="Lanata2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lanata |first=John C. |title=Behind the scenes.: A closer look at the school shooters |journal=Sheriff |date=March–April 2003 |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=22–26 |url=http://finlandschooleducation.com/vocational-training-is-bright-spot-amid-finland-school-education-system-malaise/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214070338/http://finlandschooleducation.com/vocational-training-is-bright-spot-amid-finland-school-education-system-malaise/ |archivedate=February 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical bullying interaction consists of three parts, the offender/bully, a victim, and one or more bystanders. This formula of three enables the bully to easily create public humiliation for their victim. Students who are bullied tend to develop behavioral problems, depression, less self-control and poorer social skills, and to do worse in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Addressing Bullying in Schools|url=http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=XZWPEkpvxSY%3D&amp;tabid=1048&amp;mid=2775|publisher=Centre for Justice and Crime Prevention|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once humiliated, victims never want to be a victim again and try to regain their image by joining groups. Often, they are rejected by their peers and follow through by restoring justice in what they see as an unjust situation. Their plan for restoration many times results in violence as shown by the school shooters. 75% of school shooters had been bullied or left behind evidence of having been [[Peer victimization|victims of bullying]], including Nathan Ferris, Edmar Aparecido Freitas, Brian Head, [[Seung-Hui Cho]], [[Rio de Janeiro school shooting#Perpetrator|Wellington Menezes Oliveira]], [[Jeff Weise]], [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting#Perpetrator|Adam Lanza]], and [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting#Nikolas Cruz|Nikolas Cruz]].

[[Cyberbullying]] has changed the effect of bullying in another way. "… in the modern era a bully can also do so on Facebook and Twitter for the world to see. Once something is on the Internet, it cannot truly be removed, further enhancing the torment. That type of bullying is infinitely easier for the perpetrator to commit and just as infinitely hard for the victim to address or escape."&lt;ref name="socialjusticesolutions.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialjusticesolutions.org/2013/12/14/school-shootings-possible-causes/|title=School Shootings and Possible Causes|first1=Justin|last1=Nutt|first2=|last2=BSW|first3=|last3=LMSW|first4=|last4=LAC|date=December 14, 2013|website=Social Justice Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notoriety===
Shooting massacres in English-speaking countries often occur close together in time.&lt;ref name="YukichTowers2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yukich|first1=Joshua|last2=Towers|first2=Sherry|last3=Gomez-Lievano|first3=Andres|last4=Khan|first4=Maryam|last5=Mubayi|first5=Anuj|last6=Castillo-Chavez|first6=Carlos|title=Contagion in Mass Killings and School Shootings|journal=PLOS One|volume=10|issue=7|year=2015|pages=e0117259|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0117259|pmid=26135941|pmc=4489652}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1966, two major stories broke: [[Richard Speck]] murdered eight women on a single night in Chicago, and [[Charles Whitman]] shot and killed 15 people from a clocktower in Austin. Neither was seeking fame, but with the new television news climate, they received it anyway. Seeing this, 18-year-old [[Robert Benjamin Smith]] bought a gun, and on November 12th, 1966, he killed four women and a toddler inside the Rose-Mar College of Beauty in Mesa, Arizona. “I wanted to get known, just wanted to get myself a name,” explained Smith. He had hoped to kill nearly ten times as many people, but had arrived at the beauty college campus too early. Upon his arrest, he was without remorse, saying simply, “I wanted people to know who I was.”&lt;ref name="The story of the first copycat mass shooter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timeline.com/first-copycat-mass-shooter-8c0f08080307|title=The story of the first copycat mass shooter|date=Nov 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towers, et al. (2015), found a small, but significant temporary increase in the probability of a second school shooting within 2 weeks after a known school shooting, which was only slightly smaller than the probability of repeats after mass killings involving firearms. However, much more work is needed with greater scope on investigations, to understand whether this is a real phenomenon or not. Some attribute this to [[Copycat crime|copycat]] behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, Paul quoted in Hannon K 1997, "Copycats to Blame for Massacres Says Expert", Courier Mail, 4/3/1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cantor | first1 = | last2 = Mullen | first2 = | last3 = Alpers | first3 = | year = 2000 | title = Mass homicide: the civil massacre | url = | journal = J Am Acad Psychiatry Law | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 55–63 | pmid = 10774842}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be correlated with the level of media exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phillips | first1 = D.

Justin Nutt, Director of Outpatient Services and Mobile Assessment at PEAK Behavioral Health Services, postulates that sometimes those who feel as though they are alone and who feel no one will remember them may seek to be remembered through acts of violence.&lt;ref name="School Shootings &amp; Possible Causes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/school-shootings-possible-causes-justin-nutt-lscsw-lac/|title=School Shootings &amp; Possible Causes|date=Originally published 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutt explains through the examination of the way in which news exposure is connected not to the victims, but the perpetrators. "… in an age of internet news and 24 hour news cycle, to avoid doing so would be seen as poor news reporting, but it also means those who feel nameless and as though no one will care or remember them when they are gone may feel doing something such as a school shooting will make sure they are remembered and listed in the history books."&lt;ref&gt;"socialjusticesolutions.org"&lt;/ref&gt; Recent premeditative writings were presented according to court documents and showed Joshua O'Connor wrote that he wanted the "death count to be as high as possible so that the shooting would be infamous".

=== Injustice collectors ===
In a 2015 [[New Republic, The|''New Republic'']] essay, [[Columbine (book)|''Columbine'']] author Dave Cullen describes a subset of school shooters (and other mass murderers) known as "injustice collectors", or people who "never forget, never forgive, [and] never let go" before they strike out. The essay describes and expands on the work of retired FBI profiler Mary Ellen O'Toole, who has published a peer-reviewed journal article on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/vio.2014.1509|title=The Dangerous Injustice Collector: Behaviors of Someone Who Never Forgets, Never Forgives, Never Lets Go, and Strikes Back!|first=Mary Ellen|last=O'Toole|date=September 1, 2014|journal=Violence and Gender|volume=1|issue=3|pages=97–99|via=online.liebertpub.com (Atypon)|doi=10.1089/vio.2014.1509}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also quotes Gary Noesner, who helped create and lead the FBI's hostage negotiation unit, and served as Chief Negotiator for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inside the Warped Mind of Vester Flanagan and Other Shooters|url = https://newrepublic.com/article/122669/injustice-collectors-how-understand-vester-flanagans-manifesto|website = The New Republic|accessdate = 2015-09-23|first = Dave|last = Cullen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental illness===
The degree to which mental illness does or does not contribute to school shootings has been debated in society.

Although the vast majority of mentally ill individuals are non-violent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1525086 | pmid=16946914 | volume=2 | issue=2 | title=Violence and mental illness: an overview | date=June 2003 | journal=World Psychiatry | pages=121–4 | last1 = Stuart | first1 = H}}&lt;/ref&gt; some evidence has suggested that mental illness or mental health symptoms are nearly universal among school shooters. A 2002 report by the US Secret Service and US Department of Education found evidence that a majority of school shooters displayed evidence of mental health symptoms, often undiagnosed or untreated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ssi_final_report.pdf "Safe School Initiative".] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.secretservice.gov%2Fntac%2Fssi_final_report.pdf&amp;date=2009-09-08 |date=September 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminologists Fox and DeLateur note that mental illness is only part of the issue, however, and mass shooters tend to externalize their problems, blaming others and are unlikely to seek psychiatric help, even if available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/12/19/mass_shootings_in_america_northeastern_criminologists_james_alan_fox_monica.html|title=Everything You Think You Know about Mass Murder Is Wrong|first=Justin|last=Peters|date=December 19, 2013|publisher=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have concluded that mass murderers display a common constellation of chronic mental health symptoms, chronic anger or antisocial traits, and a tendency to blame others for problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15332586.2011.581523|title=Psychological Profiles of School Shooters: Positive Directions and One Big Wrong Turn|first1=Christopher J.|last1=Ferguson|first2=Mark|last2=Coulson|first3=Jane|last3=Barnett|date=January 1, 2011|journal=Journal of Police Crisis Negotiations|volume=11|issue=2|pages=141–158|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1080/15332586.2011.581523}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they note that attempting to "profile" school shooters with such a constellation of traits will likely result in many false positives as many individuals with such a profile do not engage in violent behaviors.

McGinty and colleagues conducted a study to find out if people tended to associate the violence of school shootings with mental illness, at the expense of other factors such as the availability of high-capacity magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last1=McGinty |first1=Emma E. |last2=Webster |first2=Daniel W. |last3=Barry |first3=Colleen L. |title=Effects of News Media Messages About Mass Shootings on Attitudes Toward Persons With Serious Mental Illness and Public Support for Gun Control Policies. |publisher=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] | date=May 2013 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=1669752}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 2,000 participants read a news piece on a shooting in which the shooter is diagnosed as having a mental illness and who used high capacity magazines. One group read an article that presented only the facts of the case. A different group read an article about the same shooting, but in it the author advocated for gun restrictions for people with mental illness. Another group read about the shooting in an article that suggested the proposal to ban large-capacity magazines, which acted to advocate that shootings could stem from a societal problem rather than an individual problem. The control group did not read anything. Participants were then all asked to fill out a questionnaire asking about their views on gun control and whether they thought there should be restrictions on high-capacity magazines. 71% of the control group thought that gun restrictions should be applied to people with mental illness, and nearly 80% of participants who read the articles agreed. Despite the fact that the article exposed the readers to both the mental illness of the shooter, and the fact that the shooter used high-capacity magazines, participants advocated more for gun restrictions on people with mental illness rather than bans on high-capacity magazines. This suggests that people believe mental illness is the culprit for school shootings in lieu of the accessibility of guns or other environmental factors. The authors expressed concern that proposals to target gun control laws at people with mental illness do not take into account the complex nature of the relationship between serious mental illness and violence, much of which is due to additional factors such as substance abuse. However, the link is unclear since research has shown that violence in mentally ill people occurs more in interpersonal environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Jessica|title=Mass Shootings and Mental Health Policy|journal=Journal of Sociology &amp; Social Welfare|date=Mar 2014|volume=41|issue=1|pages=107–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 opinion piece concluded that 22% of mass murders are committed by people who suffer from a serious mental illness, and 78% do not. This study also concluded that many people with mental illnesses do not engage in violence against others and that most violent behavior is due to factors other than mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/opinion/policy-dose/articles/2018-02-21/after-florida-school-shooting-look-to-the-root-causes-of-gun-violence]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violent video games ===
It has long been debated that there exists a correlation between school shooting perpetrators and the type of media they consume. A popular profile for school shooters is someone who has been exposed to or enjoys playing violent video games. However, this profile is considered by many researchers to be misguided or erroneous. Ferguson (2009) has argued that a third variable of gender explains the illusory correlation between video game use and the type of people who conduct school shootings. Ferguson explains that the majority of school shooters are young males, who are considerably more aggressive than the rest of the population. A majority of gamers are also young males. Thus, it appears likely that the view that school shooters are often people who play violent video games is more simply explained by the third variable of gender.

The idea of profiling school shooters by the video games they play comes from the belief that playing violent video games increases a person's aggression level, which in turn, can cause people to perpetrate extreme acts of violence, such as a school shooting. There is little to no data supporting this hypothesis (Ferguson, 2009) but it has become a vivid profile used by the media since the Columbine Massacre in 1999.

A summation of past research on video game violence finds that video games have little to no effect on aggression (Anderson,2004; Ferguson, 2007 &amp; Spencer, 2009). Again, this supports the idea that although it is a popular opinion to link school shooters to being violent video gamers, this misconception is often attributable to third variables and has not been supported by research on the connection between aggression and gaming.

Ultimately, this type of profiling is popular in media but not supported by any data (Anderson, 2004).

==Frequency trends==
School shootings are a "modern phenomenon". There were scattered instances of gunmen or bombers attacking schools in the years before the [[Frontier Middle School shooting]] in [[Moses Lake, Washington]] in 1996, "but they were lower profile", according to journalist [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=nyr20151019/&gt; Beginning in the late 1990s, there has been a steep increase in the frequency of school shootings across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robertz|first1=Frank|title=Deadly Dreams|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deadly-dreams/|website=Scientific American|publisher=Scientific American Mind|accessdate=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}} In the United States specifically, the most recent trend has been downward following the spikes of the 1990s, yet at the same time they are trending towards a higher likelihood of being premeditated and executed with a strict plan in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robertz|first1=Frank|title=Deadly Dreams|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deadly-dreams/|website=Scientific American Mind|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by [[Northeastern University]] found that "four times the number of children were killed in schools in the early 1990s than today".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.northeastern.edu/2018/02/26/schools-are-still-one-of-the-safest-places-for-children-researcher-says/|title=Schools are safer than they were in the 90s, and school shootings are not more common than they used to be, researchers say|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2018, [[NPR]] reported that a U.S. Education Department report, released earlier in the year, for the 2015-2016 school year said "nearly 240 schools ... reported at least 1 incident involving a school-related shooting". However, when [[NPR]] researched this 'claim', it could confirm only 11 actual incidents.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/08/27/640323347/the-school-shootings-that-werent|title=The School Shootings That Weren't|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Federal government tracks school shootings, and as noted above, a U.S. Education Department report, released earlier in the year, for the 2015-2016 school year said "nearly 240 schools ... reported at least 1 incident involving a school-related shooting". NPR independently evaluated this claim and only confirmed 11 of the 240 cited incidents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Addressing school shootings in the United States was made more difficult by the passage by [[United States Congress]] of the [[Dickey Amendment]] in 1996, which mandated that no [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] funds “may be used to advocate or promote gun control”, although this does not mean the CDC has stopped researching gun violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nvdrs/index.html|title=National Violent Death Reporting System{{!}}NVDRS{{!}}Violence Prevention{{!}}Injury Center{{!}}CDC|date=2018-09-19|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm|title=Stats of the States - Firearm Mortality|date=2018-05-01|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/youthviolence/schoolviolence/index.html|title=About School Violence|date=2018-11-01|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Congress relies on independent research done by non-partisan organizations for getting data on gun violence in the United States.

Between the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]] and the 2018 [[Santa Fe High School shooting]] in Texas, more than 214,000 students experienced gun violence at 216 schools, and at least 141 children, educators and other people were killed and another 284 were injured. 38% of the students who experienced school shootings were [[African American]] although African American students were 16.6% of the school population.&lt;ref name="wapo20180518"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/local/school-shootings-database/|title=School shootings|last1=Woodrow Cox|first1=John|date=May 18, 2018|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=May 18, 2018|last2=Rich|first2=Steven|last3=Chiu|first3=Allyson|last4=Muyskens|first4=John|last5=Ulmanu|first5=Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools in at least 36 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] have experienced a shooting.&lt;ref name=wapo20180325/&gt;

70% of the perpetrators of school shootings were under the age of 18, with the median age of 16. More than 85% of the perpetrators of school shootings obtained their firearms from their own homes or from friends or relatives.&lt;ref name=wapo20180518/&gt; Targeted school shootings, those occurring for example in the context of a feud, were about three times as common as those that appeared indiscriminate. Most perpetrators of school shootings exhibited no signs of debilitating [[mental disorder]], such as [[psychosis]] or [[schizophrenia]], although most mass killers typically have or exhibit signs of depression. On the other hand, [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Eric Harris]] was almost certainly a psychopath as noted by the FBI.&lt;ref name=wapo20180325/&gt; Between the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]] in Colorado and 2015, "more than 40 people" were "charged with Columbine-style plots;" almost all were white male teenagers and almost all had studied the Columbine attack or cited the Columbine perpetrators [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]] as inspiration.&lt;ref name=cnn20151103&gt;{{cite news |first = Wayne |last = Drash |title = The massacre that didn't happen |publisher = [[CNN]] |date = November 3, 2015 |accessdate = April 2, 2017 |url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/03/us/minnesota-foiled-school-massacre-john-ladue/index.html |quote = The suspects are almost always white male teenagers who have studied the Colorado high school massacre or cite the killers as inspiration.

At least 68 schools that experienced a school shooting employed a police officer or security guard; in all but a few, the shooting ended before any intercession. Security guards or resource officers were present during four of the five school shooting incidents with the highest number of dead or injured: the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]] in Colorado, the 2018 [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]], the 2018 [[Marshall County High School shooting]] in Kentucky, and the 2001 [[Charles Andrew Williams|Santana High School shooting]] in California.&lt;ref name=wapo20180325/&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo20131205/&gt;

====Studies of United States school shootings====
During 1996, the CDC ([[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]) together with the [[US Department of Education]] and the [[United States Department of Justice]], published a review of deaths related to schools occurring as a result of violence, including explicitly "unintentional firearm-related death", for the academic years 1992-1993 and 1993-1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=School-associated%20violent%20deaths%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C%201992%20to%201994.&amp;author=SP%20Kachur&amp;author=G%20Stennies&amp;author=K%20Powell&amp;publication_year=&amp;journal=JAMA.&amp;volume=&amp;pages= SP Kachur, GM Stennies, KE Powell, W Modzeleski (1996)] (sourced from Anderson; Kaufman; Simon 2001) Accessed February 24, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; A second study (Anderson; Kaufman; Simon 2001), a continuation from the 1996 study, was published December 5, and covered the period 1994-1999.&lt;ref&gt;M. Anderson; J. Kaufman; T.R.

A [[United States Secret Service]] study concluded that schools were placing false hope in physical security, when they should be paying more attention to the pre-attack behaviors of students.  Zero-tolerance policies and metal detectors "are unlikely to be helpful," the Secret Service researchers found. The researchers focused on questions concerning the reliance on SWAT teams when most attacks are over before police arrive, profiling of students who show warning signs in the absence of a definitive profile, expulsion of students for minor infractions when expulsion is the spark that push some to return to school with a gun, buying software not based on school shooting studies to evaluate threats although killers rarely make direct threats, and reliance on metal detectors and police officers in schools when shooters often make no effort to conceal their weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url=http://powerreporting.com/files/shoot.pdf |title=Deadly Lessons: School Shooters Tell Why |date=October 15–16, 2000 |accessdate=April 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002, the Secret Service published a report that examined 37 U.S. school shootings. They had the following findings:
* Incidents of targeted violence at school were rarely sudden, impulsive acts.
* Prior to most incidents, other people knew about the attacker's idea or plan to attack.
* Most attackers did not threaten their targets directly prior to advancing the attack.
* There is no accurate or useful profile of students who engaged in targeted school violence.
* Most attackers engaged in some behavior prior to the incident that caused others concern or indicated a need for help.
* Most attackers had difficulty coping with significant losses or personal failures. Moreover, many had considered or attempted suicide.
* Many attackers felt bullied, persecuted, or injured by others prior to the attack.
* Most attackers had access to and had used weapons prior to the attack.
* In many cases, other students were involved in some capacity.
* Despite prompt law enforcement responses, most shooting incidents were stopped by means other than law enforcement intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vossekuil |first=B |author2=Fein R|author3=Reddy M|author4=Borum R|author5=Modzeleski W |title=The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School Initiative: Implications for the Prevention of School Attacks in the United States |url=http://www.treas.gov/usss/ntac/ssi_final_report.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030617182534/https://www.treasury.gov/usss/ntac/ssi_final_report.pdf |archivedate=June 17, 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=March 1, 2018 |publisher=U.S. Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program and U.S. Secret Service |location=National Threat Assessment Center, Washington, D.C. |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political impact==
School shootings and other mass killings have had a major political impact. Governments have discussed gun-control laws, to increase time for background checks. Also, bulletproof school supplies have been created, including backpacks,&lt;ref name="bul"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Another organization that has proposed possible solutions to school shootings is the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA), to allow teachers to carry weapons on school grounds as a means of protecting themselves and others. So far,{{When|date=April 2017}} ten states have already introduced legislation to allow weapons on school property with eighteen states already allowing guns to be carried on school grounds, but not without constraints. Most states also require the gun carriers to receive advance permission from the districts' superintendents or trustees. "In New York State, written permission from the school is required in order to carry a firearm on school grounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teachers with Guns: Firearms Discharges by Schoolteachers, 1980–2012 |url=http://homicidecenter.org/publication/teachers-with-guns-examining-a-policy-intervention/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401025348/http://homicidecenter.org/publication/teachers-with-guns-examining-a-policy-intervention/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-04-01 |format=PDF |agency=Homicidecenter.org |page=1 |date=August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the political impact, this has spurred some to press for more stringent [[gun control]] laws. In the United States, the [[National Rifle Association]] is opposed to such laws, and some groups have called for fewer gun control laws, citing cases of armed students ending shootings and halting further loss of life, and claiming that the prohibitions against carrying a gun in schools do not deter the gunmen.&lt;ref name="lab1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Puryear |url=http://www.learnaboutguns.com/2008/04/30/the-flawed-reasoning-behind-gun-free-zones/ |title=A discussion of the reasoning behind gun free zone, 2007–2008 |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|reason=pro-gun website is source, not objective.|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmsg.org/resources/publications/issue-8-the-debate-on-gun-policies-in-US-and-midwest-newspapers|title=Issue 8: The debate on gun policies in U.S. and midwest newspapers - Berkeley Media Studies Group|website=Bmsg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example is the [[Mercaz HaRav Massacre]], where the attacker was stopped by a student, Yitzhak Dadon, who shot him with his personal firearm which he lawfully carried concealed.

A [[Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997|ban]] on the ownership of handguns was introduced in the United Kingdom (with the exception of Northern Ireland) following the [[Dunblane massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2609427.stm |title=New Year gun amnesty planned |date=December 27, 2002 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994|The Gun-Free Schools Act]] was passed in 1994 in response to gun related violence in schools, so many school systems started adopting the Zero-Tolerance Law. The Gun-Free Schools Act required people to be expelled from the school for a year. By the year of 1997 the Zero-Tolerance for any type of weapon was implemented by more than 90 percent of U.S public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2000031000&amp;type=hitlist&amp;num=0#.UnxPbvmshcY|title=Zero Tolerance for School Violence|journal=CQ Researcher by CQ Press|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that a majority of shooting attacks occur in Gun-Free zones, leading many to believe that they do not actually stop any attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/05/10/do-98-percent-of-mass-public-shootings-happen-in-gun-free-zones/|title=Analysis {{!}} Do 98 percent of mass public shootings happen in gun-free zones?|website=Washington Post|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police response and countermeasures==
Analysis of the Columbine school shooting and other incidents where first responders waited for backup has resulted in changed recommendations regarding what bystanders and first responders should do. An analysis of 84 mass shooting cases in the US from 2000 to 2010 found that the average response time by police was 3 minutes.&lt;ref name=NYT4613/&gt; In most instances that exceeds the time the shooter is engaged in killing. While immediate action may be extremely dangerous, it may save lives which would be lost if people involved in the situation remain passive, or a police response is delayed until overwhelming force can be deployed. It is recommended{{according to whom|date=May 2018}} that civilians involved in the incident take active steps to evacuate, hide, or counter the shooter and that individual law enforcement officers present or first arriving at the scene attempt immediately to engage the shooter. In many{{how many|date=May 2018}} instances, immediate action by civilians or law enforcement has saved lives. For these reasons, it is recommended{{according to whom|date=May 2018}} that civilians are properly trained in how to respond to active shooter situations.&lt;ref name=NYT4613&gt;{{cite news|title=In Shift, Police Advise Taking an Active Role to Counter Mass Attacks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/us/in-a-shift-police-advise-taking-an-active-role-to-counter-mass-attacks.html|accessdate=April 7, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 6, 2013|author=Erica Goode}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College and university response and countermeasures==
The Massengill Report was an after-action report created in the wake of the [[Virginia Tech shooting]], which brought national attention to the need for colleges and universities to take concerning behavior and threats seriously. It has led to the creation of hundreds of behavioral intervention teams which help access and coordinate institutional responses to behavioral concerns on college and university campuses.

==School countermeasures==

=== Armed classrooms ===
There has been considerable policy discussion about how to help prevent school and other types of mass shootings. One suggestion that has come up is the idea to allow firearms in the classroom. "Since the issue of arming teachers is a relatively new topic, it has received little empirical study. Therefore, most of the literature does not come from peer reviewed sources but rather published news reports. In addition, most of these reports are not objective and clearly appear to support a specific side of the debate."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Teachers with Guns: Firearms Discharges by School teachers, 1980–2012 |url= http://homicidecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Teachers-with-Guns-RESEARCH-REPORT-FINAL.pdf|website=Homicidecenter.org|accessdate=21 May 2018 |page=3 |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, data has been inconclusive as to whether or not arming teachers would have any sort of benefit for schools. For years, some areas in the US have allowed "armed classrooms" to deter (or truncate) future attacks by changing helpless victims into armed defenders. Advocates of arming teachers claim that it will reduce fatalities in school shootings, but many others disagree.

Many teachers have had their concerns with the idea of armed classrooms. "One teacher stated that although she is pro-gun, she does not feel as though she could maintain gun safety on school grounds (Reuters, 2012). Teachers expressed the fear that bigger students could overpower them, take the weapon, and then use it against the teacher or other students." Some members of the armed forces have also had concerns with armed classrooms. Police forces in Texas brought up the potential for teachers to leave a gun where a student could retrieve and use it. "They are further concerned that if every teacher had a gun, there would be an unnecessarily large number of guns in schools (even including elementary schools). This large number of guns could lead to accidental shootings, especially those involving younger children who do not understand what guns do."

In order to diminish school shootings all together there are many preventative measures that can be taken such as: 
* Installing wireless panic alarms to alert law enforcement. 
* Limiting points of entry with security guarding them. 
* Strategically placing telephones for emergencies so police are always reachable at any point in the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Robert|last2=Duplechain|first2=Rosalind|title=New Ways To Stop Bullying|journal=Monitor on Psychology|date=2002|volume=33|issue=9|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Employing school psychologists to monitor and provide mental health services for those that need help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf|format=PDF|title=Now Is The Time|website=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Coordinating a response plan between local police and schools in the event of a threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Deadly Dreams|last=Robertz|first=Frank|date=1 August 2007|work=Scientific American|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 research report published by the [[Center for Homicide Research]], they find that many also reject the idea of having armed classrooms due to what is termed the "[[weapons effect]]", which is the phenomenon in which simply being in the presence of a weapon can increase feelings of aggression. "In Berkowitz &amp; LaPage's (1967) examination of this effect, students who were in the presence of a gun reported higher levels of aggressive feelings towards other students and gave more violent evaluations of other students' performance on a simple task in the form of electric shocks. This finding points to possible negative outcomes for students exposed to guns in the classroom (Simons &amp; Turner, 1974; Turner &amp; Simons, 1976)."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 2008, [[Harrold Independent School District]] in [[Texas]] became the first public school district in the U.S. to allow teachers with state-issued firearm-carry permits to carry their arms in the classroom; special additional training and ricochet-resistant ammunition were required for participating teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/us/29texas.html?scp=2&amp;sq=gun+control&amp;st=nyt |first=James C. |last=McKinley Jr. |title=In Texas School, Teachers Carry Books and Guns |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students at the [[University of Utah]] have been allowed to carry [[concealed carry|concealed pistols]] (so long as they possess the appropriate state license) since a [[State Supreme Court]] decision in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/27/america/NA-GEN-US-Campus-Guns.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219151807/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/27/america/NA-GEN-US-Campus-Guns.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 19, 2008 |title=Guns on college campuses allowed in U.S. state Utah |agency=The Associated Press |newspaper=[[Int.

A commentary in the conservative [[National Review|''National Review Online'']] argues that the armed school approach for preventing school attacks, while new in the US, has been used successfully for many years in Israel and [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel200409022215.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107001716/http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel200409022215.asp |archivedate=January 7, 2010 |first=Dave |last=Kopel |title=Follow the Leader: Israel and Thailand set an example by arming teachers. |journal=[[National Review]] |date=September 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers and school officials in Israel are allowed and encouraged to carry firearms if they have former military experience in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], which almost all do. Statistics on what percentage of teachers are actually armed are unavailable and in Israel, for example, the intent is to counter politically motivated terrorist attacks on high value, soft targets, not personal defense against, or protection from, unbalanced individual students.

The National Rifle Association has explicitly called for placing armed guards in all American schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/us/nra-calls-for-armed-guards-at-schools.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; | work=The New York Times | first1=Eric | last1=Lichtblau | first2=Motoko | last2=Rich | title=N.R.A. Calls for Armed Guards at Schools | date=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Steven Strauss]], a faculty member at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, offered a preliminary calculation that placing armed guards in every American school might cost as much as $15 billion/year, and perhaps only save 10 lives per year (at a cost of $1.5 billion/life saved).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-strauss/armed-guards-in-schools_b_2468810.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Five Concerns About Armed Guards in Schools | date=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preventive measures ===
Because of the increase in guns in the United States, many schools and local communities are taking it into their own hands by providing young students with early gun safety courses to make them aware of the dangers these objects actually are,also to prevent school shootings.According to Katherine A. Fowler, PhD, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An average 1,297 children die (two children per 100,000) and 5,790 are treated for injuries caused by guns each year, the study reported. Six percent of these deaths were accidental, 38% were suicides, 53% were homicides and the remaining 3% were from legal intervention or undetermined reasons. Guns injured children at a rate of 8 per 100,000 children, but this rate is likely considerably higher because of unreported injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2017/06/19/american-denial-about-facts-on-guns-continues-to-kill-children/#38cd87354a9a|title=Children Are Dying Because Of Americans' Denial About Guns|last=Tara|first=Haelle|date=Jun 19, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A preventive measure proposed for stopping school shooting has been focused on securing firearms in the home. A shooting in [[Sparks, Nevada]] on October 21, 2013, left a teacher and the shooter, a twelve-year-old student, dead with two seriously injured. The handgun used in the shooting had been taken from the shooter's home. [[Sandy Hook Elementary School]] in Newtown, [[Red Lake High School]] in Red Lake, Minnesota in 2005, and [[Heath High School (Kentucky)|Heath High School]] in West Paducah, Kentucky in 1997 also involved legal guns taken from the home.

A 2000 study of firearm storage in the United States found that "from the homes with children and firearms, 55% reported to have one or more firearms in an unlocked place". 43% reported keeping guns without a trigger lock in an unlocked place. In 2005 a study was done on adult firearm storage practices in the United States found that over 1.69 million youth under age 18 are living in homes with loaded and unlocked firearms. Also, 73% of children under age 10 living in homes with guns reported knowing the location of their parents' firearms.&lt;ref&gt;"Preventing school shootings starts with gun safety at home". ''Christian Science Monitor''. 31 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states have Child Access Prevention Laws – laws designed to prevent children from accessing firearms. Each state varies in the degree of the severity of these laws. The toughest laws enforce criminal liability when a minor achieves access to a carelessly stored firearm. The weakest forbid people from directly providing a firearm to a minor. There is also a wide range of laws that fall in between the two extremes. One example is a law that enforces criminal liability for carelessly stored firearms, but only where the minor uses the firearm and causes death or serious injury. An example of a weaker law is a law that enforces liability only in the event of reckless, knowing or deliberate behavior by the adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Randich, Cheri|title=Description of State Child Access Prevention Laws.|publisher=Law &amp; Justice|date=10 December 2012|url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/Senate/Committees/LAW/Documents/SummaryOfStateChildAccessPreventionLaws.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Countermeasures ===
In 2015 [[Southwestern High School (Shelbyville, Indiana)|Southwestern High School]] in [[Shelbyville, Indiana]], was portrayed as possibly the "safest school in America". The school has been used as a "Safe School Flagship" of possible countermeasures to an [[active shooter]].&lt;ref name=indi-sheriffs&gt;{{cite web |title=Indiana Sheriffs Set New Standard in School Safety |url=http://www.indianasheriffs.org/ns/school.php |website=indianasheriffs.org |publisher=Indiana Sheriffs Association |accessdate=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Cameras, described as "military-grade", that feed video directly to Shelby County Sheriff’s Office&lt;ref name=indi-sheriffs/&gt; are mounted throughout the school.&lt;ref name=take-safe/&gt;
* [[Smoke canister]]s mounted in the roof of corridors can be remotely discharged to slow a shooter's movement.&lt;ref name=take-safe&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hockenberry|first1=John |title=Is This the Safest School in America? |url=http://www.thetakeaway.org/story/safest-school-america/ |work=[[The Takeaway]] |accessdate=October 18, 2015 |date=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countermeasures include tools like doorjambs, rapidly-deployable tourniquets, and ballistic protection systems like the CoverMe-Seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/chair-doubles-bulletproof-vest-879802|title=Tired of mass shootings, man creates a chair that turns into bulletproof vest|date=April 13, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Seal of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria''' is the official symbol of the [[President of Nigeria|Nigerian President]]. It was first used in 1979 by President [[Shehu Shagari]] in the ill-fated [[Nigerian Second Republic|second republic]], and jettisoned by the successive [[Nigerian military juntas of 1966–79 and 1983–98|military regimes from 1983 to 1999]]. The presidential seal returned to usage in the wake of the [[Nigerian Fourth Republic|fourth republic]] in 1999, and it has remained in use since.

A '''self-replicating machine''' is a type of [[autonomous robot]] that is capable of reproducing itself autonomously using raw materials found in the environment, thus exhibiting [[self-replication]] in a way analogous to that found in [[nature]]. The concept of self-replicating machines has been advanced and examined by [[Homer Jacobsen]], [[Edward F. Moore]], [[Freeman Dyson]], [[John von Neumann]] and in more recent times by [[K. Eric Drexler]] in his book on [[nanotechnology]], ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' (coining the term '''clanking replicator ''' for such machines) and by [[Robert Freitas]] and [[Ralph Merkle]] in their review ''Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines''&lt;ref name="Freitas 2004"&gt;{{cite book| last=Freitas| first=Robert A.|author2=Ralph C. Merkle | title=Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines| year=2004| publisher=Landes Bioscience| location=Georgetown, Texas| isbn=1-57059-690-5| url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provided the first comprehensive analysis of the entire replicator design space. The future development of such technology is an integral part of several plans involving the mining of [[moon]]s and [[asteroid]] belts for ore and other materials, the creation of lunar factories, and even the construction of [[solar power satellite]]s in space. The possibly misnamed [[von Neumann probe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.11.htm#p3 |title=3.11 Freitas Interstellar Probe Replicator (1979-1980) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one theoretical example of such a machine. Von Neumann also worked on what he called the [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]], a self-replicating machine that would operate in a [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] environment.

A self-replicating machine is an artificial [[self-replication|self-replicating]] system that relies on conventional large-scale technology and automation. Certain idiosyncratic terms are occasionally found in the literature. For example, the term clanking replicator was once used by Drexler&lt;ref name=EoC&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_4.html#section01of03| title=Engines of Abundance (Chapter 4) Clanking Replicators| work=Engines of Creation| first=K. Eric| last=Drexler| year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish macroscale replicating systems from the microscopic [[nanorobot]]s or "[[assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]]" that [[nanotechnology]] may make possible, but the term is informal and is rarely used by others in popular or technical discussions. Replicators have also been called "von Neumann machines" after John von Neumann, who first rigorously studied the idea. However, the term "von Neumann machine" is less specific and also refers to a completely unrelated [[Von Neumann architecture|computer architecture]] that von Neumann proposed and so its use is discouraged where accuracy is important.&lt;ref name="Freitas 2004"/&gt; Von Neumann himself used the term [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] to describe such self-replicating machines.

Historians of [[machine tool]]s, even before the [[numerical control]] era, sometimes figuratively said that machine tools were a unique class of machines because they have the ability to "reproduce themselves"&lt;ref name="Colvin1947pp6-7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Colvin|1947|pp=6–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by copying all of their parts. Implicit in these discussions is that a human would direct the cutting processes (later planning and programming the machines), and would then be assembling the parts. The same is true for [[RepRap Project|RepRaps]], which are another class of machines sometimes mentioned in reference to such non-autonomous "self-replication". In contrast, machines that are ''truly autonomously'' self-replicating (like [[Molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]]) are the main subject discussed here.

==History==

The general concept of artificial machines capable of producing copies of themselves dates back at least several hundred years. An early reference is an anecdote regarding the philosopher [[René Descartes]], who suggested to Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] that the human body could be regarded as a machine; she responded by pointing to a clock and ordering "see to it that it reproduces offspring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientific American| title=Build Your Own Replicator| volume=285|date=August 2001| pages=38–39| first=Moshe| last= Sipper|author2=James A. Reggia }} Several other variations on this anecdotal response also exist.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other variations on this anecdotal response also exist. [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] proposed in his 1872 novel ''[[Erewhon]]'' that machines were already capable of reproducing themselves but it was man who made them do so,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/1.htm#p5 |title=1 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and added that ''"machines which reproduce machinery do not reproduce machines after their own kind"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Samuel Butler |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-ButErew.html |title=Erewhon, Chapter 24, The book Of the Machines |publisher=Nzetc.org |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[George Eliot|George Eliot's]] 1879 book ''[[Impressions of Theophrastus Such]]'', a series of essays that she wrote in the character of a fictional scholar named Theophrastus, the essay "Shadows of the Coming Race" speculated about self-replicating machines, with Theophrastus asking "how do I know that they may not be ultimately made to carry, or may not in themselves evolve, conditions of self-supply, self-repair, and reproduction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George Eliot |url=http://www.online-literature.com/george_eliot/theophrastus-such/17/ |title=Impressions of Theophrastus Such, Chapter 17, Shadows of the Coming Race |publisher=online-literature.com |accessdate=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 [[William Paley]] formulated the first known [[teleological argument]] depicting machines producing other machines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/1.htm#p11 |title=1 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the [[watchmaker argument|question of who originally made a watch]] was rendered moot if it were demonstrated that the watch was able to manufacture a copy of itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=William| last= Paley| title= Natural Theology: or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, Collected from the Appearances of Nature| chapter=Chapter i, Section 1| publisher= E.

In the course of the 1950s, suggestions of several increasingly simple mechanical systems capable of self-reproduction were made—notably by [[Lionel Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1179|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===von Neumann's kinematic model===

A detailed conceptual proposal for a physical non-biological self-replicating system was first put forward by mathematician [[John von Neumann]] in lectures delivered in 1948 and 1949, when he proposed a [[kinematic]] self-reproducing automaton model as a [[thought experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=von Neumann| first=John| year=1966| title=The Theory of Self-reproducing Automata| editor= A. Burks| publisher=Univ. of Illinois Press| location= Urbana, IL| isbn=0-598-37798-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/2.1.htm |title=2.1 Von Neumann's Contributions |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann's concept of a physical self-replicating machine was dealt with only abstractly, with the hypothetical machine using a "sea" or stockroom of spare parts as its source of raw materials. The machine had a program stored on a memory tape that directed it to retrieve parts from this "sea" using a manipulator, assemble them into a duplicate of itself, and then copy the contents of its memory tape into the empty duplicate's. The machine was envisioned as consisting of as few as eight different types of components; four logic elements that send and receive stimuli and four mechanical elements used to provide a structural skeleton and mobility. While qualitatively sound, von Neumann was evidently dissatisfied with this model of a self-replicating machine due to the difficulty of analyzing it with mathematical rigor. He went on to instead develop an even more abstract model self-replicator based on [[cellular automata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/2.1.3.htm |title=2.1.3 The Cellular Automaton (CA) Model of Machine Replication |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His original kinematic concept remained obscure until it was popularized in a 1955 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kemeny| first=John G.| title=Man Viewed as a Machine| journal=Scientific American| volume=192|date=April 1955| issue=4| pages=58–67| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0455-58| bibcode=1955SciAm.192d..58K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moore's artificial living plants===

In 1956 mathematician [[Edward F. Moore]] proposed the first known suggestion for a practical real-world self-replicating machine, also published in ''Scientific American''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Scientific American| first=Edward F.| last=Moore|date=October 1956| volume=195| title=Artificial Living Plants| issue=4| pages=118–126| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1056-118| bibcode=1956SciAm.195d.118M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.1.htm |title=3.1 Moore Artificial Living Plants (1956) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's "artificial living plants" were proposed as machines able to use air, water and soil as sources of raw materials and to draw its energy from sunlight via a [[solar cell|solar battery]] or a [[steam engine]]. He chose the seashore as an initial habitat for such machines, giving them easy access to the chemicals in seawater, and suggested that later generations of the machine could be designed to float freely on the ocean's surface as self-replicating factory barges or to be placed in barren desert terrain that was otherwise useless for industrial purposes. The self-replicators would be "harvested" for their component parts, to be used by humanity in other non-replicating machines.

===Dyson's replicating systems===

The next major development of the concept of self-replicating machines was a series of thought experiments proposed by physicist [[Freeman Dyson]] in his 1970 Vanuxem Lecture.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, "The twenty-first century," Vanuxem Lecture delivered at Princeton University, 26 February 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.6.htm |title=3.6 Dyson Terraforming Replicators (1970, 1979) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed three large-scale applications of machine replicators. First was to send a self-replicating system to [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], which in addition to producing copies of itself would also be programmed to manufacture and launch [[solar sail]]-propelled cargo spacecraft. These spacecraft would carry blocks of Enceladean ice to [[Mars]], where they would be used to [[Terraforming of Mars|terraform the planet]]. His second proposal was a solar-powered factory system designed for a terrestrial desert environment, and his third was an "industrial development kit" based on this replicator that could be sold to developing countries to provide them with as much industrial capacity as desired. When Dyson revised and reprinted his lecture in 1979 he added proposals for a modified version of Moore's seagoing artificial living plants that was designed to distill and store fresh water for human use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Chapter 18: Thought Experiments| work=Disturbing the Universe| first=Freeman J.| last=Dyson| year=1979| publisher=Harper and Row| location=New York| pages=194–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "[[Astrochicken]]."

===''Advanced Automation for Space Missions''===
[[File:Advanced Automation for Space Missions figure 5-19.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's conception of a "self-growing" robotic lunar factory]]

In 1980, inspired by a 1979 "New Directions Workshop" held at Wood's Hole, [[NASA]] conducted a joint summer study with [[ASEE]] entitled [[s:Advanced Automation for Space Missions|Advanced Automation for Space Missions]] to produce a detailed proposal for self-replicating factories to develop [[Moon|lunar]] resources without requiring additional launches or human workers on-site. The study was conducted at [[Santa Clara University]] and ran from June 23 to August 29, with the final report published in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Advanced_Automation_for_Space_Missions |editor=[[Robert Freitas]], William P. Gilbreath| title=Advanced Automation for Space Missions| year=1982| id=NASA Conference Publication CP-2255 (N83-15348)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed system would have been capable of [[exponential growth|exponentially increasing]] productive capacity and the design could be modified to build self-replicating probes to explore the galaxy.

The reference design included small computer-controlled electric carts running on rails inside the factory, mobile "paving machines" that used large parabolic mirrors to focus sunlight on lunar [[regolith]] to melt and sinter it into a hard surface suitable for building on, and robotic front-end loaders for [[strip mining]]. Raw lunar regolith would be refined by a variety of techniques, primarily [[hydrofluoric acid]] [[Leaching (metallurgy)|leaching]]. Large transports with a variety of manipulator arms and tools were proposed as the constructors that would put together new factories from parts and assemblies produced by its parent.

Power would be provided by a "canopy" of solar cells supported on pillars. The other machinery would be placed under the canopy.

A "[[casting]] [[robot]]" would use sculpting tools and templates to make [[plaster]] [[molding (process)|molds]]. Plaster was selected because the molds are easy to make, can make precise parts with good surface finishes, and the plaster can be easily recycled afterward using an oven to bake the water back out. The robot would then cast most of the parts either from nonconductive molten rock ([[basalt]]) or purified metals. A carbon dioxide [[laser cutting]] and welding system was also included.

A more speculative, more complex microchip fabricator was specified to produce the computer and electronic systems, but the designers also said that it might prove practical to ship the chips from Earth as if they were "vitamins."

A 2004 study supported by NASA's Institute for Advanced Concepts took this idea further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/studies/883Toth-Fejel.html|title=Modeling Kinematic Cellular Automata: An Approach to Self-Replication|last=Toth-Fejel|first=Tihamer|date=|year=2004|website=|publisher=NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts are beginning to consider self-replicating machines for [[asteroid mining]].

Much of the design study was concerned with a simple, flexible chemical system for processing the ores, and the differences between the ratio of elements needed by the replicator, and the ratios available in lunar [[regolith]]. The element that most limited the growth rate was [[chlorine]], needed to process regolith for [[aluminium]]. Chlorine is very rare in lunar regolith.

===Lackner-Wendt Auxon replicators===

In 1995, inspired by Dyson's 1970 suggestion of seeding uninhabited deserts on Earth with self-replicating machines for industrial development, [[Klaus Lackner]] and Christopher Wendt developed a more detailed outline for such a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lackner| first=Klaus S.|author2=Christopher H.

Their proposal didn't include a complete analysis of the system's material requirements, but described a novel method for extracting the ten most common chemical elements found in raw desert topsoil (Na, Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Al, C, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) using a high-temperature carbothermic process. This proposal was popularized in [[Discover Magazine]], featuring solar-powered desalination equipment used to irrigate the desert in which the system was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Discover|date=October 1995| first=Thomas| last=Bass| title=Robot, build thyself| pages=64–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; They named their machines "Auxons", from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''auxein'' which means "to grow."

==Recent work==

===Self-replicating rapid prototypers===
[[File:Reprap Darwin.jpg|thumb|right|RepRap 1.0 "Darwin" prototype]]

Early experimentation with [[rapid prototyping]] in 1997-2000 was not expressly oriented toward reproducing rapid prototyping systems themselves, but rather extended simulated "[[evolutionary robotics]]" techniques into the physical world. Later developments in rapid prototyping have given the process the ability to produce a wide variety of electronic and mechanical components, making this a rapidly developing frontier in self-replicating system research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.20.htm |title=Freitas 2004, pp. 64-67 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Chris Phoenix informally outlined a design for a hydraulically powered replicator a few cubic feet in volume that used ultraviolet light to cure soft plastic feedstock and a fluidic logic control system, but didn't address most of the details of assembly procedures, error rates, or machining tolerances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup| author=Christopher J.

[[File:First replication.jpg|300px|right|thumb|All of the plastic parts for the machine on the right were produced by the almost identical machine on the left. (Adrian Bowyer (left) and Vik Olliver(right) are members of the RepRap project.)]]

In 2005, [[Adrian Bowyer]] of the [[University of Bath]] started the [[RepRap Project]] to develop a [[rapid prototyping]] machine which would be able to manufacture some or most of its own components, making such machines cheap enough for people to buy and use in their homes. The project is releasing its designs and control programs under the [[GNU GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://staff.bath.ac.uk/ensab/replicator/| title=WebHome| accessdate=2007-02-18| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112200308/http://staff.bath.ac.uk/ensab/replicator/| archivedate=2007-01-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RepRap approach uses [[fused deposition modeling]] to manufacture plastic components, possibly incorporating conductive pathways for circuitry. Other components, such as steel rods, nuts and bolts, motors and separate electronic components, would be supplied externally. In 2006 the project produced a basic functional prototype and in May 2008 the machine succeeded in producing all of the plastic parts required to make a 'child' machine.

Some researchers have proposed a [[microfactory]] of specialized machines that support recursion—nearly all of the parts of all of the machines in the factory can be manufactured by the factory.&lt;ref&gt;

===NIAC studies on self-replicating systems===

In the spirit of the 1980 "Advanced Automation for Space Missions" study, the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]] began several studies of self-replicating system design in 2002 and 2003. Four phase I grants were awarded:

===Bootstrapping Self-Replicating Factories in Space===

In 2012, NASA researchers Metzger, Muscatello, Mueller, and Mantovani argued for a bootstrapping approach to start self-replicating factories in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Metzger | first=Philip | last2=Muscatello | first2=Anthony | last3=Mueller | first3=Robert | last4=Mantovani | first4=James | title=Affordable, Rapid Bootstrapping of the Space Industry and Solar System Civilization | journal=Journal of Aerospace Engineering | volume=26 | issue=1 | pages=18–29 | publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers | date= January 2013 | language=English | url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000236 | doi=10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000236 | access-date=2016-09-24| arxiv=1612.03238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They developed this concept on the basis of [[In situ resource utilization|In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU)]] technologies that NASA has been developing to "live off the land" on the Moon or Mars. Their modeling showed that in just 20 to 40 years this industry could become self-sufficient then grow to large size, enabling greater exploration in space as well as providing benefits back to Earth. In 2014, [[Thomas Kalil]] of the White House [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] published on the White House blog an interview with Metzger on bootstrapping solar system civilization through self-replicating space industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/10/14/bootstrapping-solar-system-civilization |title=Bootstrapping a Solar System Civilization |publisher=The White House |date=2014-10-14 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalil requested the public submit ideas for how "the Administration, the private sector, philanthropists, the research community, and storytellers can further these goals." Kalil connected this concept to what former NASA Chief technologist [[Mason Peck]] has dubbed "Massless Exploration", the ability to make everything in space so that you do not need to launch it from Earth. Peck has said, "...all the mass we need to explore the solar system is already in space. It's just in the wrong shape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-01-05/exciting-new-ideas-space-technology-are-getting-short-changed-congress |title=Exciting new ideas in space technology are getting short-changed by Congress |publisher=PRI.org |date=2015-01-15 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Metzger argued that fully self-replicating industry can be started over several decades by astronauts at a lunar outpost for a total cost (outpost plus starting the industry) of about a third of the space budgets of the [[International Space Station]] partner nations, and that this industry would solve Earth's energy and environmental problems in addition to providing massless exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Metzger | first=Philip | title=Space Development and Space Science Together, an Historic Opportunity | journal=Space Policy | volume=37 | issue=2 | pages=77–91 | publisher=Elsevier Ltd. | date= August 2016 | language=English | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265964616300625 | doi=10.1016/j.spacepol.2016.08.004 | access-date=2016-12-09 | arxiv=1609.00737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cornell University's self-assembler===

In 2005, a team of researchers at [[Cornell University]], including [[Hod Lipson]], implemented a self-assembling machine. The machine is composed of a tower of four articulated [[cube]]s, known as ''molecubes'', which can revolve about a [[triagonal]]. This enables the tower to function as a [[robotic arm]], collecting nearby molecubes and assembling them into a copy of itself. The arm is directed by a [[computer program]], which is contained within each molecube, analogous to how each animal [[cell (biology)|cell]] contains an entire copy of its [[DNA]]. However, the machine cannot manufacture individual molecubes, nor do they occur naturally, so its status as a self-replicator is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news4055.html |title=Researchers build a robot that can reproduce |publisher=Physorg.com |date=2005-05-11 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New York University artificial DNA tile motifs ===

In 2011, a team of scientists at [[New York University]] created a structure called 'BTX' (bent triple helix) based around three double helix molecules, each made from a short strand of DNA.  Treating each group of three double-helices as a code letter, they can (in principle) build up self-replicating structures that encode large quantities of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111012132651.htm |title=Self-Replication Process Holds Promise for Production of New Materials| publisher=Science Daily |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368/full/nature10500.html |title=Self-replication of information-bearing nanoscale patterns|journal=Nature|accessdate=2011-10-13|volume=478|doi=10.1038/nature10500|pages=225–228|bibcode=2011Natur.478..225W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-replication of magnetic polymers ===

In 2001 Jarle Breivik at [[University of Oslo]] created a system of magnetic building blocks, which in response to temperature fluctuations, spontaneously form self-replicating polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/3/4/273 |title=Self-Organization of Template-Replicating Polymers and the Spontaneous Rise of Genetic Information| publisher=Entroy |accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-replication of neural circuits ===

In 1968 [[Zellig Harris]] wrote that "the metalanguage is in the language,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Mathematical Structures of Language|page=17|last=Harris|first=Zellig|year=1968|publisher=John Wiley and Son|location= New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that self-replication is part of language. In 1977 [[Niklaus Wirth]] formalized this proposition by publishing a self-replicating [[deterministic context-free grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wirth|first1=Niklaus|title= What can we do about the unnecessary diversity of notation for syntactic definitions?|journal=Commun. ACM|volume=20|pages=822–823|doi=10.1145/359863.359883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to it probabilities, [[Bertrand du Castel]] published in 2015 a self-replicating [[stochastic grammar]] and presented a mapping of that grammar to [[neural networks]], thereby presenting a [[Conceptual model|model]] for a self-replicating neural circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=du Castel|first1=Bertrand|title=Pattern Activation/Recognition Theory of Mind|journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience|volume=9|issue=90|publisher=EPFL|location=Lausanne|date = 15 July 2015|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2015.00090/full|doi=10.3389/fncom.2015.00090|ref=neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial construction==
Partial construction is the concept that the constructor creates a partially constructed (rather than fully formed) offspring, which is then left to complete its own construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Automata 2008| title=Signal Crossing Solutions in von Neumann Self-replicating Cellular Automata| year=2008| first=William R.| last=Buckley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Biological Theory| title=Computational Ontogeny| volume=3| issue=1| year=2008| first=William R.| last=Buckley|doi=10.1162/biot.2008.3.1.3|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The von Neumann model of self-replication envisages that the mother automaton should construct all portions of daughter automatons, without exception and prior to the initiation of such daughters. Partial construction alters the construction relationship between mother and daughter automatons, such that the mother constructs but a portion of the daughter, and upon initiating this portion of the daughter, thereafter retracts from imparting further influence upon the daughter. Instead, the daughter automaton is left to complete its own development. This is to say, means exist by which automatons may develop via the mechanism of a zygote.

==Self-replicating spacecraft==
{{Main article|Self-replicating spacecraft}}

The idea of an automated spacecraft capable of constructing copies of itself was first proposed in scientific literature in 1974 by [[Michael A. Arbib]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.11.htm#p1 |title=3.11 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Michael A.| last=Arbib| title=The Likelihood of the Evolution of Communicating Intelligences on Other Planets| work= Interstellar Communication: Scientific Perspectives| editor=Cyril Ponnamperuma, A. G. W. Cameron| location=Boston| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company| year=1974| pages=59–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept had appeared earlier in [[science fiction]] such as the 1967 novel ''[[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]]'' by [[Fred Saberhagen]] or the 1950 novellette trilogy ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'' by [[A. E. van Vogt]]. The first quantitative engineering analysis of a self-replicating spacecraft was published in 1980 by [[Robert Freitas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Robert A., Jr.| last=Freitas| title=A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe| journal=[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]]| volume=33|date=July 1980| pages=251–264| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm | accessdate = 2008-10-01|bibcode = 1980JBIS...33..251F }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the non-replicating [[Project Daedalus]] design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication. The design's strategy was to use the probe to deliver a "seed" factory with a mass of about 443 tons to a distant site, have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself there to increase its total manufacturing capacity, and then use the resulting automated industrial complex to construct more probes with a single seed factory on board each.

== Prospects for implementation ==
As the use of industrial automation has expanded over time, some factories have begun to approach a semblance of self-sufficiency that is suggestive of self-replicating machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.7.htm |title=3.7 Self-Replicating Automated Industrial Factory (1973-present) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such factories are unlikely to achieve "full closure"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.6.htm |title=5.6 Closure Theory and Closure Engineering |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the cost and flexibility of automated machinery comes close to that of human labour and the manufacture of spare parts and other components locally becomes more economical than transporting them from elsewhere. As [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] has pointed out in [[Erewhon]], replication of partially closed universal machine tool factories is already possible. Since safety is a primary goal of all legislative consideration of regulation of such development, future development efforts may be limited to systems which lack either control, matter, or energy closure. Fully capable machine replicators are most useful for developing resources in dangerous environments which are not easily reached by existing transportation systems (such as [[outer space]]).

An artificial replicator can be considered to be a form of [[artificial life]]. Depending on its design, it might be subject to [[evolution]] over an extended period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.9.L.htm |title=5.1.9.L Evolvability |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with robust [[error correction]], and the possibility of external intervention, the common [[science fiction]] scenario of robotic life run amok will remain extremely unlikely for the foreseeable future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.11.htm |title=5.11 Replicators and Public Safety |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tibet Peaceful Liberation Monument, Potala Square.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Tibet "Peaceful Liberation" Monument, Potala Square, Lhasa in 2009 celebrating the [[People's Liberation Army]] entering Tibet]]
The '''[[sinicization]] of Tibet''' refers to the [[cultural assimilation]] which has occurred in Tibetan areas of [[China]] (including the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and surrounding [[Tibetan people|Tibetan-designated]] [[Autonomous administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|autonomous areas]]) and has made these areas resemble mainstream Chinese society. The changes, evident since the [[incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China]] in 1950–51, have been facilitated by a range of economic, social, cultural and political reforms introduced to Tibet by the [[Government of China|Chinese government]]. Critics cite the government-sponsored migration of large numbers of [[Han Chinese]] into the Tibet Autonomous Region as a major component of sinicization.

According to the [[Central Tibetan Administration|government of Tibet in exile]], Chinese policy has resulted in the disappearance of elements of [[Tibetan culture]]; this has been called "[[cultural genocide]]".&lt;ref&gt;Burbu, Dawa (2001) ''China's Tibet Policy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-7007-0474-3}}, pp 100–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Samdup"&gt;Samdup, Tseten (1993) [http://www.tibet.com/Humanrights/poptrans.html Chinese population – Threat to Tibetan identity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712112116/http://www.tibet.com/HumanRights/poptrans.html |date=12 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government in exile says that the policies intend to make Tibet an integral part of China and control desire for Tibetan [[self-determination]].

The Chinese government maintains that its policies have benefited Tibet, and cultural and social changes are consequences of [[modernization]]. According to the government, Tibet's economy has expanded; improved services and infrastructure have improved the quality of life of [[Tibetans]], and the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] and [[Tibetan culture|culture]] have been protected.

== History ==

===Early developments===
{{main|Battle of Chamdo}}
After the fall of the [[Qing dynasty]] and before 1950, the region roughly corresponding to the modern-day [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]] (TAR) was a ''[[de facto]]'' independent nation.  It printed its own currency and postage, and maintained international relations. Tibet claimed three provinces ([[Amdo]], [[Kham]] and [[Ü-Tsang]]), but only controlled western Kham and Ü-Tsang.{{cn|date=November 2016}} Since 1950, China made eastern Kham part of [[Sichuan]] and western Kham part of the new [[Tibet Autonomous Region]].&lt;ref&gt;Burbu, Dawa (2001) ''China's Tibet Policy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-7007-0474-3}}, pp 86–99&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early-20th-century [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China era]] which followed the Qing dynasty, Chinese Muslim general and [[Qinghai]] governor [[Ma Bufang]] is accused by Tibetans of implementing [[sinicization]] and [[Islamification]] policies in Tibetan areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Three Provinces of the Snowland, Losar Tashi Delek! |author=Woser |url=http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?article=%22Three+Provinces+of+the+Snowland%2C+Losar+Tashi+Delek!%22+%3A+By+Woser&amp;id=29212&amp;t=1&amp;c=4 |newspaper=Phayul |date=10 March 2011&lt;!--21:11--&gt; |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forced conversion]] and heavy taxes were reported under his rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6IH_pG2yLssC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq=ma+bufang+taiwan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4xDJTP2CFcaAlAeCnPnnAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20bufang%20taiwan&amp;f=false |title=Life and Marriage in Skya Rgya, a Tibetan Village |author=Blo brtan rdo rje, Charles Kevin Stuart |year=2008 |publisher=YBK Publishers, Inc. |page=xiv |isbn=0-9800508-4-7 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Mao Zedong won the Chinese civil war in 1949, his goal was the unification of the "five nationalities" as the People's Republic of China under the Communist Party of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaik|2011|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tibetan government in [[Lhasa]] sent [[Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme|Ngabo]] (known as Ngabo in English sources) to [[Chamdo]] in Kham, a strategic town near the border, with orders to hold his position while reinforcements came from Lhasa to fight the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaik|2011|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October 1950, news arrived that the People's Liberation Army was advancing towards Chamdo and had taken the town of Riwoche (which could block the route to Lhasa).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaik|2011|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngabo and his men retreated to a monastery, where the People's Liberation Army surrounded and captured them.&lt;ref name="Schaik 2011 212"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaik|2011|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngabo wrote to Lhasa suggesting a peaceful surrender instead of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaik|2011|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Chinese negotiator, "It is up to you to choose whether Tibet would be liberated peacefully or by force. It is only a matter of sending a telegram to the PLA group to recommence their march to Lhasa."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaik|2011|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngabo accepted Mao's [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet|Seventeen-Point Agreement]], which stipulated that in return for Tibet becoming part of the People's Republic of China, it would be granted [[autonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaik|2011|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking support from the rest of the world, in August 1951 the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] sent a telegram to Mao accepting the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaik|2011|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delegates signed the agreement under duress, and the Tibetan's government's future was sealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laird|first1=Thomas|title=The story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama|date=2006|publisher=Atlantic Books|location=London|isbn=9781843541448|page=307|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Story_of_Tibet.html?id=Iqw7PgAACAAJ|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the incorporation of Tibet into China is known in Chinese [[historiography]] as the [[Peaceful Liberation of Tibet]],&lt;!-- Citations given on page --&gt; the [[Dalai Lama]] considers it a colonization&lt;ref name="Tibet Profile BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tibet profile - Overview|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-16689779|accessdate=19 September 2015|work=BBC News|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tibetan Youth Congress]] agrees that it was also an invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=50 years of Colonization|url=http://www.tibetanyouthcongress.org/colonisation/|work=[[Tibetan Youth Congress]]|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government points to improvements in health and the economy as justifications for their assertion of power in what it calls a historically-Chinese region. According to the Dalai Lama, China has encouraged [[Han Chinese]] immigration into the region.&lt;ref name="Tibet Profile BBC"/&gt;

Before the agreement, Tibet's economy was dominated by [[subsistence agriculture]] and the stationing of 35,000 Chinese troops during the 1950s strained the region's food supplies. When the Dalai Lama visited Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1954, Mao told him that he would move 40,000 Chinese farmers to Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Forster-Latsch, H. and Renz S., P.

As part of the 1960s [[Great Leap Forward]], Chinese authorities coerced Tibetan farmers to cultivate maize instead of barley (the region's traditional crop). The harvest failed, and thousands of Tibetans starved.&lt;ref name="Dragon LS"&gt;Shakya, Tsering (1999) ''The Dragon in the Land of Snows'', Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7126-6533-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TibCiv"&gt;Stein, Rolf (1972) ''Tibetan Civilization'', Stanford University Press, {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural Revolution===
The [[Cultural Revolution]], involving students and laborers of the Communist Party of China, was initiated by Mao and carried out by the [[Gang of Four]] from 1966 to 1976 to preserve [[Maoism]] as China's leading ideology. It was an intra-party struggle to eliminate political opposition to Mao.&lt;ref name="Mao's LR"&gt;MacFarquhar, Roderick &amp; Michael Schoenhals (2006) ''Mao's Last Revolution'', Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-674-02332-1}}, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cultural Revolution affected all of China, and Tibet suffered as a result. [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] attacked civilians, who were accused of being traitors to communism. More than six thousand monasteries were looted and destroyed. Monks and nuns were forced to leave their monasteries to "live a normal life", with those who resisted imprisoned. Prisoners were forced to perform hard labor, tortured and executed. Although the [[Potala Palace]] was threatened, Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] intervened and restrained the Tibetan Red Guards.

===Recent developments===
China's National Strategic Project to Develop the West, introduced during the 1980s after the Cultural Revolution, encourages the migration of Chinese people from other regions of China into Tibet with bonuses and favorable living conditions. People volunteer to be sent there as teachers, doctors and administrators to assist Tibet's development.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/02/tibet-through-chinese-eyes/6395/ |title=Tibet Through Chinese Eyes |author=Peter Hessler |publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=29 February 2012|date=February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing an unqualified labour force and less-developed infrastructure, the Chinese government has encouraged migrants to stimulate competition and change Tibet from a traditional to a market economy with [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms set forth]] by [[Deng Xiaoping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tibetology.ac.cn/en/publications/latest-articles/5675-temporary-labor-migration-in-urban-lhasa-in-2005-?view=article&amp;id=5675%3Atemporary-labor-migration-in-urban-lhasa-in-2005-&amp;catid=160%3Alatest-articles |title=Temporary Labor Migration in Urban Lhasa in 2005 |author=Tanzen Lhundup, Ma Rong |publisher=China Tibetology Network |date=25–26 August 2006 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetans are the majority ethnic group in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], making up about 93 percent of the population in 2008.&lt;ref name=eth&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/guides/456900/456954/html/nn5page1.stm | title=Cultural shift | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Samdup" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Uroš Pinterič|Pinteric, Uros]] (2003): http://www.sidip.org/SIDIP_files/pintericu_tibet.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''International Status Of Tibet'', Association for Innovative Political Science, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2008 attacks by Tibetans on Han- and Hui-owned property were reportedly due to the large Han Hui influx into Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beijing renews tirade|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/322807/Beijing-renews-tirade.html |newspaper=Sunday Pioneer |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to George Fitzherbert, "Tibetans complain of being robbed of their dignity in their homeland by having their genuinely loved leader incessantly denounced, and of being swamped by Chinese immigration to the point of becoming a minority in their own country."&lt;ref&gt;"To engage with China's arguments concerning Tibet is to be subjected to the kind of intellectual entrapment, familiar in the Palestinian conflict, whereby the dispute is corralled into questions which the plaintiff had never sought to dispute. Tibetans complain of being robbed of their dignity in their homeland by having their genuinely loved leader incessantly denounced, and of being swamped by Chinese immigration to the point of becoming a minority in their own country. But China insistently condemns such complaints as separatism, an offence in China under the crime of 'undermining national unity', and pulls the debate back to one about Tibet's historical status. Foreigners raise questions about human rights and the environment, but China again denounces this as a foreign intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation, and pulls the debate back to Tibet's historical status." George Fitzherbert, "Land of Clouds", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 30 June 2008 p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government has attempted to develop Tibet as part of its [[China Western Development]] policy. The Chinese government has invested 310 billion yuan (about 45.6 billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet since 2001. In 2009 it invested over $7 billion into the region, 31 percent more than the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/world/asia/25tibet.html?pagewanted=all |title='China’s Money and Migrants Pour Into Tibet' |date=24 July 2010 |accessdate=29 February 2012 |author=Edward Wong|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Qinghai-Tibet Railway]] was completed in 2006 at a cost of $3.68&amp;nbsp;billion, leading to increased tourism from the rest of China.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xinhua News Agency]] (24 August 2005).

== Education and employment ==
Since 1949 the Chinese government has used the minority-education system for  Tibetans to acquire the Chinese language, and minority education has been considered a key aspect of Sinicization pressure. Since the early 2000s, however, there has been a process of Tibetanization of Tibetan education in Qinghai's Tibetan regions. Through grassroots initiatives by Tibetan educators, Tibetan has been somewhat available as the main language of instruction in primary, secondary and tertiary education.&lt;ref&gt;Zenz, Adrian (2010). "Beyond Assimilation: The Tibetanisation of Tibetan Education in Qinghai", in Inner Asia Vol.12 Issue 2, pp.293-315&lt;/ref&gt; The Tibetan language remains marginalized in government employment, with a small number of public-service positions mandating a Tibetan degree or Tibetan language skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Tibetanness under Threat?

== Population growth ==
In 1949, there were between 300 and 400 Han-Chinese residents in Lhasa.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Barraux, Histoire des Dalaï Lamas – Quatorze reflets sur le Lac des Visions, Albin Michel, 1993, reprinted in 2002, Albin Michel, {{ISBN|2-226-13317-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the city covered less than three square kilometres and had around 30,000 inhabitants; the Potala Palace and the village of Zhöl below it were considered separate from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Liu Jiangqiang, Preserving Lhasa's history (part one), in ''Chinadialogue'', 13 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emily T. Yeh, [http://spot.colorado.edu/~yehe/Mayaram_ch_3.pdf Living Together in Lhasa. Ethnic Relations, Coercive Amity, and Subaltern Cosmopolitanism]: "Lhasa’s 1950s population is also frequently estimated at around thirty thousand. At that time the city was a densely packed warren of alleyways branching off from the Barkor path, only three square kilometers in area. The Potala Palace and the village of Zhöl below it were considered separate from the city."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, according to the first population census, Lhasa had about 30,000 residents (including 4,000 beggars, but not including 15,000 monks).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Hahn, [http://www.docin.com/p-53063117.html Urban Planning in Lhasa. The traditional urban fabric, contemporary practices and future visions], Presentation Given at the College of Architecture, Fanzhu University, 21 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Lhasa's permanent population was estimated at a little under 140,000, including 96,431 Tibetans, 40,387 Han-Chinese, and 2,998 Chinese Muslims and others. Added to that figure were 60,000–80,000 temporary residents, primarily Tibetan pilgrims and traders.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Fjeld, Commoners and Nobles.

== {{anchor|Controversy}}Debate ==
{{See also|Tibetan sovereignty debate}}
In 1989, high-profile French [[criminal law]]yer [[Robert Badinter]] participated in an episode of ''[[Apostrophes (talk show)|Apostrophes]]'' (a well-known French television program devoted to human rights) with the Dalai Lama. Referring to the disappearance of [[Tibetan culture]], Badinter used the phrase "[[cultural genocide]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Les droits de l'homme Apostrophes'', A2 – 21 April 1989 – 01h25m56s, Web site of the [[Institut natial de l'audiovisuel|INA]]: http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&amp;from=fulltext&amp;full=Salonique&amp;num_notice=5&amp;total_notices=8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the Dalai Lama used the same phrase to describe the destruction of Tibetan culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalailama.com/page.104.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124050847/http://dalailama.com/page.104.htm |archivedate=24 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }} 10 March Archive&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]], he accused the Chinese of cultural genocide in their crackdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=BBC | title='Eighty killed' in Tibetan unrest | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7299212.stm | date=16 March 2008 | accessdate=2 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 [[Robert Barnett (scholar)|Robert Barnett]], director of the Program for Tibetan Studies at [[Columbia University]], said that it was time for accusations of cultural genocide to be dropped: "I think we have to get over any suggestion that the Chinese are ill-intentioned or trying to wipe out Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barnett, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2008/03/26/seven-questions-what-tibetans-want/ Seven Questions: What Tibetans Want], ''Foreign Policy'', March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnett voiced his doubts in a review in the ''New York Review of Books'': "Why, if Tibetan culture within Tibet is being 'fast erased from existence', [do] so many Tibetans within Tibet still appear to have a more vigorous cultural life, with over a hundred literary magazines in Tibetan, than their exile counterparts?"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barnett, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2008/may/29/thunder-from-tibet/ Thunder from Tibet, a review of [[Pico Iyer]]'s book, ''The Open Road: The Global Journey of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama'', Knopf, 275 p.], in ''The New York Review of Books'', vol. 55, number 9. 29 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2651">'''Spectrophilia''' is [[sexual attraction]] to [[ghost]]s or [[sexual arousal]] from images in [[mirror]]s, as well as the alleged phenomenon of sexual encounters between [[ghost]]s and [[human]]s.

==Spectrophilia as a fetish==
Spectrophilia is a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] that is classified as the [[paraphilia]] in which one is attracted to ghosts or spirits. Spectrophiliacs fantasize about ghosts and often imagine scenarios involving sexual events between themselves or others and spirits.

==Succubus and Incubus==
In western folklore, the [[succubus]] is a demon or evil spirit who takes on a female human form to seduce men. The succubus most commonly seduces men through intercourse. The succubus is said to take semen from the male for use in impregnating a woman. 

The counterpart of the succubus is the [[incubus]]. The incubus is a demon that is said to take on a male human form. The incubus, much like the succubus, is said to seduce women into sex with the objective of impregnating the woman with its semen.&lt;ref name="csicop1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen Stollznow|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/paranormal_paramours |title=CSI &amp;#124; Paranormal Paramours |publisher=Csicop.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that succubi and incubi are spirits or ghosts that have sexual intercourse with men and women classifies the phenomenon as spectrophilia.

==Spectrophilia in folklore==
Many cultures have [[folklore]] involving spirits having sexual relations with humans, including [[Arab culture|Arabic]], [[Greek culture|Greek]], [[Hindu culture|Hindu]], and [[Celts|Celtic]] culture.

==Evidence==
No scientific evidence has been documented on the phenomenon of spectrophilia, though it has become a frequently talked-about subject among [[Ghost hunting|ghost hunters]], including [[Ghost Adventures]] and the [[Travel Channel]]'s show titled ‘Ghostly Lovers’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/Video/who-are-these-ghostly-lovers-11635 |title=Who are these ghostly lovers? : Video |publisher=Travel Channel |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern fiction==
Several films have dealt with the concept, among them ''[[The Entity]]'' (1981), ''[[Ghost_(1990_film)|Ghost]]'' (1990) , Dusk Maiden Of Amnesia (2008) and ''[[It Follows]]'' (2014).

'''Temple names''' are commonly used when naming most [[Table of Chinese monarchs|Chinese]], [[List of Korean monarchs|Korean]] ([[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon dynasty|Joseon]] periods), and [[Vietnam]]ese (such dynasties as [[Trần dynasty|Trần]], [[Lý dynasty|Lý]], and [[Lê dynasty|Lê]]) royalty. They should not be confused with [[Chinese era name|era name]]s. Compared to [[posthumous name]]s, the use of temple names is more exclusive.  Both titles were given after death to an emperor or king, but unlike the often elaborate posthumous name, a temple name almost always consists of only two [[Chinese characters|character]]s:

# an adjective: chosen to reflect the circumstances of the emperor's reign (such as "Martial" or "Lamentable").  The vocabulary overlaps with that of posthumous titles' adjectives, but for one emperor, the temple name's adjective character usually does not repeat as one of the many adjective characters in his posthumous name. The usual exception is "Filial" (孝). The founders are almost always either "High" (高) or "Grand" (太).
# "emperor": either ''zǔ'' (祖) or ''zōng'' (宗).
#* ''Zu'' ("forefather") implies a progenitor, either a founder of a dynasty or a new line within an existing one. The equivalent in [[Korean nobility#Wang|Korean]] is ''jo'' (조), and ''tổ'' in Vietnamese
#* ''Zong'' ("ancestor") is used in all other rulers. It is ''jong'' (종) in Korean, and ''tông'' in Vietnamese.

The "temple" in "temple name" refers to the "[[Imperial Ancestral Temple|grand temple]]" (太廟), also called "great temple" (大廟) or "ancestral temple" (祖廟), where [[crown prince]]s and other royalty gathered to worship their ancestors.  The ancestral tablets in the grand temple recorded the temple names of the rulers.

In earlier times, only rulers had temple names, such as Taihao (太昊). Temple names were assigned sporadically from the Han dynasty and regularly from the [[Tang dynasty]].  Some Han emperors had their temple names permanently removed by their descendants in 190.  They are the usual way to refer to emperors from the Tang dynasty up to the [[Ming dynasty]].  For the Ming dynasty and [[Qing dynasty]] (from 1368), [[Chinese era name|era name]]s were used instead (either is acceptable in Ming).

In Korea, temple names are used to refer to kings of the early [[Goryeo]] (until 1274), and kings and emperors of the [[Joseon Dynasty]].  For the [[Korean Empire]] (1897–1910), era names should be used, but the temple names are often used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Korea: a historical and cultural dictionary|author1=Keith Pratt |author2=Richard Rutt |author3=James Hoare |year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7007-0464-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vietnam, most rulers are known by their temple names, with the exception of [[Tây Sơn Dynasty|Tây Sơn]] and [[Nguyễn Dynasty|Nguyễn]] Dynasty rulers, who are better known by their era names.

''The Awesomes'' was the first time [[Michael Tavera]] composed music for an adult animated series. Tavera has been well known for composing music for [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Time Squad]]'', Disney's ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series]]'', and [[Kids' WB]]'s ''[[¡Mucha Lucha!]]''

===Connection to ''Saturday Night Live''===
''The Awesomes'' has a strong association with the [[NBC]] weekly TV series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', starring many current and former ''SNL'' cast members including [[Seth Meyers]], [[Bill Hader]], [[Kenan Thompson]], [[Taran Killam]], [[Bobby Moynihan]], [[Rachel Dratch]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Will Forte]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Kate McKinnon]], [[Colin Quinn]], [[Fred Armisen]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Chris Kattan]], [[Cecily Strong]], [[Vanessa Bayer]], [[Noël Wells]], [[Nasim Pedrad]] and [[Aidy Bryant]] as well as ''SNL'' writers [[Steve Higgins]], [[Emily Spivey]], [[Paula Pell]], [[Tim Robinson (comedian)|Tim Robinson]], Alex Baze and [[John Lutz]]. [[Lorne Michaels]] serves as executive producer, as he does with many other ''SNL''-associated shows. Meyers created the show and Meyers, Killam, Thompson, and Hader all have starring roles while Moynihan, Dratch, Rudolph, Forte, Poehler, McKinnon, Strong and Quinn each have either recurring roles or play various small parts. Of these cast members and writers, Colin Quinn is the only one whose time at ''SNL'' did not overlap with Meyers.

===Connection to ''MADtv''===
[[Ike Barinholtz]], [[Bobby Lee]], [[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh Meyers]], Taran Killam, and [[David Herman]] were all cast members from the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[MADtv]]''.

'''''The Cambridge Companion to Bob Dylan''''' is a book published in 2009 by [[Cambridge University Press]] intended to analyze the work of American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Bob Dylan]]. It is the fourth book of ''Cambridge Companion to American Studies''. This book is edited by Kevin J. Dettmar and contains seventeen essays, each written by a different person.

The whole book is divided in two sections. The first one ("Perspectives"), containing nine essays, attempts to describe different sides of Dylan's work. The next section ("Landmark Albums") describes eight landmark Dylan albums.

== Reception ==
Kieran Curran of ''[[PopMatters]]'' gave the book 5 stars out of 10, and stated: "it's an interesting read for the academically inclined budding Dylanologist [...], even if it is lacking in a pop musicology sense. For the unconverted to Dylan though, there would be no point in picking this up – every essay is built upon the assumption that Dylan is worthy of extended proselytising."&lt;ref name="curran"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Curran|first1=Kieran|title=The Cambridge Companion to Bob Dylan by Kevin Dettmar (editor)|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/110626-the-cambridge-companion-to-bob-dylan-by-kevin-dettmar-editor/|accessdate=7 August 2017|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turanism''', also known as '''pan-Turanianism''' or '''pan-Turanism''', is a [[Nationalism|nationalist]] cultural and political movement born in the 19th century to counter the effects of [[Pan-nationalism|pan-nationalist]] ideologies [[pan-Germanism]] and [[pan-Slavism]].&lt;ref name="Farkas"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.valosagonline.hu/index.php?oldal=cikk&amp;cazon=904&amp;lap=0|title=FARKAS Ildikó: A magyar turanizmus török kapcsolatai ("The Turkish connections of Hungarian Turanism")|publisher=www.valosagonline.hu [Valóság (2013 I.-IV)]|year=2013|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proclaimed the need for close cooperation between or an alliance with culturally, linguistically or ethnically related peoples of [[Inner Asia|Inner]] and [[Central Asia]]n origin&lt;ref&gt;"A „turáni népek” elnevezés már átment a köztudatba és azt kiváló angol, francia, amerikai, német és más tudósok is állandóan használják a tudományosabb, de hosszabb „ural-altai” elnevezés helyett, amellyel az teljesen egyértelmű. Mi turáni eredetű népek alatt Európában főleg a finneket, az észteket, a magyarokat, a bolgárokat és törököket értjük, Ázsiában pedig főleg az egész, nagyon elterjedt török (turk) népcsaládot, mely jelenleg Kis-Ázsia, a kaukázusi táj, Szibéria, Közép- és Kelet-Ázsia (jakutok) nagy részét foglalja magában, továbbá a mongol és mandzsu-tunguz csoportot, mely előbbihez főleg az északi kínaiak, utóbbiakhoz a japániak is tartoznak."

"The 'Turanian peoples' denomination has already became established, and it is frequently used by excellent English, French, American, German and other scholars, in place of the more scientific but longer term 'Ural-Altaic', with which it is completely identical. Under the Turanian peoples of Europe we mainly understand the Finns, the Estonians, the Hungarians, the Bulgarians and Turks, and in Asia the widely dispersed family of Turkic peoples who at present encompass large parts of Asia Minor, the Caucasus, Siberia, Central and East Asia (Yakuts), as well as the Mongol and Manchu-Tungusic groups, into the first of which mainly the northern Chinese belong to, and into the latter the Japanese too."

The idea of a "Turanian brotherhood and collaboration" was borrowed from the pan-Slavic concept of "Slavic brotherhood and collaboration".&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/error404|title=Britannica.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term itself originates from the name of a geographical area, the [[Turan Depression]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}{{dubious|date=November 2017}} The term Turan was widely used in scientific literature from the 18th century onwards to denote Central Asia. European scholars borrowed the term from the historical works of [[Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur]]; the annotated English translation of his ''Shajare-i Türk'' was published in 1729 and quickly became an oft used source for European scholars.

This political ideology originated in the work of the Finnish nationalist and linguist [[Matthias Castrén|Matthias Alexander Castrén]], who championed the ideology of pan-Turanism—the belief in the racial unity and the future greatness of the Ural-Altaic peoples. He concluded that the Finns originated in Central Asia (more specifically in the [[Altai Mountains]]) and far from being a small isolated people, they were part of a larger polity that included such peoples as the [[Hungarians|Magyars]], Turks, Mongols and the like.&lt;ref&gt;EB on Matthias Alexander Castrén. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/98799/Matthias-Alexander-Castren&lt;/ref&gt; It implies not only the unity of all [[Turkic peoples]] (as in [[pan-Turkism]]), but also the alliance of a wider Turanian or [[Ural-Altaic]] family believed to include all peoples speaking "[[Turanian languages]]".

Although Turanism is a political movement for the union of all Uralo-Altaic peoples, there are different opinions about inclusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nihal-atsiz.com/yazi/turancilik-h-nihal-atsiz.html|title=Turancılık – (H. Nihal ATSIZ) - Ulu Türkçü Nihal ATSIZ Otağı - Türkçülük - Turancılık ve Hüseyin Nihal Atsız|website=www.nihal-atsiz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of the famous Turanist [[Ziya Gökalp]], Turanism is for Turkic peoples only as the other Turanian peoples (Finns, Hungarians, Mongolians and so on) are too different culturally, thus he narrowed Turanism into pan-Turkism.&lt;ref&gt;Türkçülüğün Esasları pg.25 (Gökalp, Ziya)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the description given by [[Lothrop Stoddard]] at the time of [[World War I]]:

{{cquote|Right across northern Europe and Asia, from the Baltic to the Pacific and from the Mediterranean to the Arctic Ocean, there stretches a vast band of peoples to whom ethnologists have assigned the name of "Uralo-Altaic race", but who are more generally termed "Turanians". This group embraces the most widely scattered folk—the [[Ottoman Turks]] of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and [[Anatolia]], the [[Turkmen people|Turcomans]] of [[Central Asia]] and [[Persia]], the [[Tatars]] of South [[Russia]] and [[Transcaucasia]], the [[Hungarians|Magyars]] of [[Hungary]], the [[Finns]] of [[Finland]] and the [[Baltic region|Baltic provinces]], the [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal tribes]] of [[Siberia]] and even the distant [[Mongols]] and [[Manchu people|Manchus]]. Diverse though they are in culture, tradition, and even physical appearance, these peoples nevertheless possess certain well-marked traits in common. Their languages are all similar, and, what is of even more import, their physical and mental make-up displays undoubted affinities.&lt;ref&gt;STODDARD, T. Lothrop. "Pan-Turanism". ''The American Political Science Review''. Vol. 11, No. 1. (1917) p.16. https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/1944138.pdf?acceptTC=true&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Max Müller's Northern Division of Turanian Languages.png|thumb|180px|[[Max Müller]]'s northern division of [[Turanian languages]]]]

== Origins of pan-Turanianism ==
The concept of a Ural-Altaic ethnic and language family goes back to the linguistic theories of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]; in his opinion there was no better method for specifying the relationship and origin of the various peoples of the Earth, than the comparison of their languages. In his ''Brevis designatio meditationum de originibus gentium ductis potissimum ex indicio linguarum'',&lt;ref&gt;LEIBNIZ, Gottfried Wilhelm: Brevis designatio meditationum de originibus gentium ductis potissimum ex indicio linguarum. 1710. https://edoc.bbaw.de/files/956/Leibniz_Brevis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; written in 1710, he originates every human language from one common ancestor language. Over time, this ancestor language split into two families: the Japhetic and the Aramaic. The Japhetic family split even further, into Scythian and Celtic branches. The members of the [[Scythian]] family were: the Greek language, the family of Sarmato-Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, Czech, Dalmatian, Bulgar, Slovene, Avar and Khazar), the family of Turkic languages (Turkish, [[Cumans|Cuman]], Kalmyk and Mongolian), the family of Finnic languages (Finnish, Saami, Hungarian, Estonian, Liv and Samoyed). Although his theory and grouping were far from perfect, it had a tremendous effect on the development of linguistic research, especially in German speaking countries.

Pan-Turanianism has its roots in the Finnish nationalist Fennophile and [[Fennoman movement]], and in the works of linguist [[Matthias Castrén|Matthias Alexander Castrén]]. The concept spread from here{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} to the kindred peoples of the Finns.

[[File:Ázsia és Európa nyelvei nyelvtani alapeveik szerint elrendezve Friedrich Max Müller 1854-ben kiadott Letter to Chevalier Bunsen on the classification of the Turanian languages című munkájában.png|thumb|180px|The languages of Asia and Europe arranged according to their grammatical principles in Max Müller's ''Letter to Chevalier Bunsen on the classification of the Turanian languages'', published in 1854]]
[[Friedrich Max Müller]], the German Orientalist and philologist, published and proposed a new grouping of the non-Aryan and non-Semitic Asian languages in 1855. In his work ''The Languages of the Seat of War in the East'', he called these languages "Turanian". Müller divided this group into two subgroups, the Southern Division, and the Northern Division.&lt;ref&gt;MÜLLER, Friedrich Max. ''The languages of the seat of war in the East. With a survey of the three families of language, Semitic, Arian and Turanian.'' Williams and Norgate, London, 1855. https://archive.org/details/languagesseatwa00mlgoog&lt;/ref&gt; In the long run, his evolutionist theory about languages' structural development, tying growing grammatical refinement to socio-economic development, and grouping languages into 'antediluvian', 'familial', 'nomadic', and 'political' developmental stages,&lt;ref&gt;MÜLLER, Friedrich Max: Letter to Chevalier Bunsen on the classification of the Turanian languages. 1854. https://archive.org/details/cu31924087972182&lt;/ref&gt; proved unsound, but his Northern Division was renamed and re-classed as the [[Ural-Altaic languages]]. Nonetheless, his terminology stuck, and the terms 'Turanian peoples' and 'Turanian languages' became parts of common parlance.

Like the term [[Aryan]] is used for Indo-European, Turanian is used chiefly as a linguistic term, synonymous with Ural-Altaic.&lt;ref&gt;M. Antoinette Czaplicka, The Turks of Central Asia in History and at the Present Day, Elibron, 2010, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Ural-Altaic and Altaic remain relevant—and still insufficiently understood—concepts of areal linguistics and typology even if in a genetic sense these terms might be considered as obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;BROWN, Keith and OGILVIE, Sarah eds.:Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World. 2009. p. 722.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable countries ==

=== Finland ===
Pan-Turanianism has its roots in the Finnish nationalist Fennophile and [[Fennoman movement]], and in the works of Finnish nationalist and linguist [[Matthias Castrén|Matthias Alexander Castrén]]. Castrén conducted more than seven years of fieldwork in western and southern Siberia between 1841 and 1849. His extensive field materials focus on Ob-Ugric, Samoyedic, Ketic, and Turkic languages. He collected valuable ethnographic information, especially on shamanism. Based on his research, he claimed that the Finnic, Ugric, Samoyed, Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic languages were all of the same 'Altaic family'. He concluded that the [[Finns]] originated in [[Central Asia]] (in the [[Altai Mountains]]), and far from being a small, isolated people, they were part of a larger polity that included such peoples as the [[Hungarians|Magyars]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Mongols]], and so on. Based on his researches, he championed the ideology of pan-Turanism, the belief in the racial unity and the future greatness of the Ural-Altaic peoples. The concept spread from here to the kindred peoples of the Finns. As Castrén put it:

{{cquote|I am determined to show the Finnish nation that we are not a solitary people from the bog, living in isolation from the world and from universal history, but are in fact related to at least one-sixth of mankind. Writing grammars is not my main goal, but without the grammars that goal cannot be attained.&lt;ref name="Łukasz Sommer"&gt;SOMMER, Łukasz: Historical Linguistics Applied: Finno-Ugric Narratives in Finland and Estonia. in: The Hungarian Historical Review. Vol. 3. Issue 2. 2014. http://hunghist.org/images/volumes/Volume3_Issue_2/Lukasz.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Castrén was of the opinion that Russia was seeking systematically to prevent all development towards freer conditions in Finland, and concluded from this that the Finns must begin to prepare a revolt against Russia. According to him, it was to be linked with a favourable international crisis and would be realised as a general revolt against Russian rule, in which the non-Russian peoples from the Turks and Tatars to the Finns would take part. This political vision of his was shared by some other intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;PAASVIRTA, Juhani: Finland and Europe: The Period of Autonomy and the International Crises, 1808-1914  1981. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Fennomans like [[Elias Lönnrot]] and [[Zachris Topelius]] shared this or an even bolder vision of coming greatness. As Topelius put it:

{{cquote|Two hundred years ago few would have believed that the Slavic tribe would attain the prominent (and constantly growing) position it enjoys nowadays in the history of culture. What if one day the Finnish tribe, which occupies a territory almost as vast, were to play a greater role on the world scene than one could expect nowadays? [...] Today people speak of Pan-Slavism; one day they may talk of Pan-Fennicism, or Pan-Suomism. Within such a Pan-Finnic community, the Finnish nation should hold the leading position because of its cultural seniority [...].&lt;ref name="Łukasz Sommer"/&gt;}}

=== Hungary ===
[[Hungarian Turanism]] ({{lang-hu|Turanizmus}}) was a Romantic nationalist cultural and political movement which was most active from the second half of the 19th century through the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Farkas"/&gt; It was based on the age old and still living national tradition about the Asian origins of the [[Magyar tribes|Magyars]]. This tradition was preserved in medieval chronicles (such as [[Gesta Hungarorum]]&lt;ref&gt;Anonymus: Gesta Hungarorum. http://mek.oszk.hu/02200/02245/02245.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]],&lt;ref&gt;Kézai Simon mester Magyar krónikája. http://mek.oszk.hu/02200/02249/02249.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Chronicon Pictum]]) as early as the 13th century. This tradition served as the starting point for the scientific research about  the ethnogenesis of the [[Hungarians|Hungarian people]], which began in the 18th century, both in [[Hungary]] and abroad. [[Sándor Kőrösi Csoma]] (the writer of the first Tibetan-English dictionary) traveled to Asia in the strong belief that he could find the kindred of the Magyars in [[Turkestan]], amongst the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]].&lt;ref name="mek.oszk.hu"&gt;Magyar Életrajzi Lexikon. http://mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; As a scientific movement, Turanism was concerned with the research about Asia and its culture in the context of Hungarian history and culture. Political Turanism was born in the 19th century, in response to the growing influence of [[Pan-Germanism]] and [[Pan-Slavism]], which were seen by Hungarians as very dangerous to the state and nation of Hungary because the country had large ethnic German and Slavic populations.&lt;ref name="Farkas"/&gt; Political Turanism was a romantic nationalist movement, which accentuated the importance of the common ancestry and the cultural affinity of the Hungarians with the peoples of the Caucasus, Inner and Central Asia, like the Turks, Mongols, Parsi and the like, and called for closer collaboration and political alliance with them, as a means to secure and further shared interests, and counter the imminent threats posed by the policies of Western powers like Germany, the British Empire, France and Russia.

The idea of a Hungarian Oriental Institute originated with Jenő Zichy.&lt;ref&gt;VINCZE Zoltán: Létay Balázs, a magyar asszirológia legszebb reménye
http://www.muvelodes.ro/index.php/Cikk?id=155&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this idea did not come true. Instead, a kind of lyceum was formed in 1910, called ''Turáni Társaság'' (Hungarian Turan Society, also called Hungarian Asiatic Society). The Turan society concentrated on Turan as geographic location where the ancestors of Hungarians might have lived.

The movement received impetus after Hungary's defeat in World War I. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Trianon]] (1920), the new Hungarian state constituted only 32.7% of the territory of historic, pre-treaty Hungary, and it lost 58.4% of its total population. More than 3.2 million ethnic Hungarians (one-third of all Hungarians) resided outside the new boundaries of Hungary in the successor states under oppressive conditions. Old Hungarian cities of great cultural importance like [[Bratislava|Pozsony]] (a former capital of the country), Kassa, and Kolozsvár were lost. Under these circumstances, no Hungarian government could survive without seeking justice for both the Magyars and Hungary. Reuniting the Magyars became a crucial point in public life and on the political agenda. Outrage led many to reject Europe and turn towards the East in search of new friends and allies in a bid to revise the unjust terms of the treaty and restore the integrity of Hungary.

{{cquote|Disappointment towards Europe caused by 'the betrayal of the West in Trianon', and the pessimistic feeling of loneliness, led different strata in society towards Turanism. They tried to look for friends, kindred peoples and allies in the East so that Hungary could break out of its isolation and regain its well deserved position among the nations. A more radical group of conservative, rightist people, sometimes even with an anti-Semitic hint propagated sharply anti-Western views and the superiority of Eastern culture, the necessity of a pro-Eastern policy, and development of the awareness of Turanic [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialism]] among Hungarian people.&lt;ref&gt;UHALLEY, Stephen and WU, Xiaoxin eds.: ''China and Christianity. Burdened Past, Hopeful Future.'' 2001. p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Magyar-Nippon Társaság'' (Hungarian Nippon Society) was founded by private persons on 1 June 1924 in order to strengthen Hungarian-Japanese cultural relations and exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;FARKAS Ildikó: A Magyar-Nippon Társaság.  In: Japanológiai körkép. 2007. http://real.mtak.hu/34745/1/Farkas_Magyar_Nippon_Tarsasag_u.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Turanism was never embraced officially because it was not in accord with the Christian conservatist ideological background of the regime, but it was used by the government as an informal tool to break the country's international isolation, and build alliances. Hungary signed treaties of friendship and collaboration with the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] in 1923,&lt;ref&gt;1924. évi XVI. törvénycikk a Török Köztársasággal Konstantinápolyban 1923. évi december hó 18. napján kötött barátsági szerződés becikkelyezéséről. http://www.1000ev.hu/index.php?a=3&amp;param=7599&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Estonia|Republic of Estonia]] in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;1938. évi XXIII. törvénycikk a szellemi együttműködés tárgyában Budapesten, 1937. évi október hó 13. napján kelt magyar-észt egyezmény becikkelyezéséről. http://www.1000ev.hu/index.php?a=3&amp;param=8078&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Finland|Republic of Finland]] in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;1938. évi XXIX. törvénycikk a szellemi együttműködés tárgyában Budapesten, 1937. évi október hó 22. napján kelt magyar-finn egyezmény becikkelyezéséről. http://www.1000ev.hu/index.php?a=3&amp;param=8084&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Japan]] in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;1940. évi I. törvénycikk a Budapesten, 1938. évi november hó 15. napján kelt magyar-japán barátsági és szellemi együttműködési egyezmény becikkelyezéséről. http://www.1000ev.hu/index.php?a=3&amp;param=8115&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Bulgaria]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;1941. évi XVI. törvénycikk a szellemi együttműködés tárgyában Szófiában az 1941. évi február hó 18. napján kelt magyar-bolgár egyezmény becikkelyezéséről. http://www.1000ev.hu/index.php?a=3&amp;param=8169&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the Soviet Red Army occupied Hungary. The Hungarian government was placed under the direct control of the administration of the occupying forces. All Turanist organisations were disbanded by the government, and the majority of Turanist publications was banned and confiscated. In 1948, Hungary was converted into a communist one-party state. Turanism was portrayed and vilified as an exclusively fascist ideology although Turanism's role in the interwar development of far-right ideologies was negligible.&lt;ref&gt;"While Turanism was and remained little more than a fringe ideology of the Right, the second orientation of the national socialists, pan-Europaism, had a number of adherents, and was adopted as the platform of several national socialist groups." JANOS, Andrew C.: ''The Politics of Backwardness in Hungary'', 1825-1945. 1982. p.275.&lt;/ref&gt; The official prohibition lasted until the collapse of the socialist regime in 1989.

=== Turkey ===
Traditional history cites its early origins amongst Ottoman officers and intelligentsia studying and residing in 1870s [[Imperial Germany]]. The fact that many Ottoman Turkish officials were becoming aware of their sense of "Turkishness" is beyond doubt of course, and the role of subsequent nationalists, such as [[Ziya Gökalp]] is fully established historically. As the Turkish historian [[Hasan Bülent Paksoy]] put it, an aspiration emerged that the [[Turkic peoples]] might "form a political entity stretching from the [[Altai Mountains]] in [[Eastern Asia]] to the [[Bosphorus]]".&lt;ref&gt;Paksoy, H.B., ‘Basmachi’: TurkestanNational Liberation Movement 1916-1930s – Modern Encyclopedia of Religions in Russia and the Soviet Union,  Florida: Academic International Press, 1991, Vol. 4&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 19th century, the works of renowned Hungarian [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] and linguist [[Ármin Vámbéry]] contributed to the spreading of [[Turkish nationalism]] and Turanism. Vámbéry was employed by the [[British Foreign office]] as an advisor and agent. He was paid well for his accounts about his meetings with members of the Ottoman elite and Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]], and for his essays concerning Ottoman politics.&lt;ref&gt;CSIRKÉS Ferenc: Nemzeti tudomány és nemzetközi politika Vámbéry Ármin munkásságában. http://www.matud.iif.hu/2013/08/07.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman Empire fell into ever deepening decline during the 19th century. There were reform and modernization attempts as early as the 1830s ([[Tanzimat]]),  but the country was lowered to an almost semi-colonial state at the turn of the century (the state accumulated an enormous amount of debt and state finances were placed under [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|direct foreign control]]), and the great powers freely preyed on her, occupying or annexing parts of her territory at will (e.g. [[Cyprus]]). At the time, the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[British Empire|British]] empires were antagonists in the so-called "[[Great Game]]" to cultivate influence in Persia and [[Central Asia]] (Turkestan). Russia and Britain systematically fanned the rivalling nationalisms of the multi-ethnic empire for their own ends,&lt;ref&gt;ERICKSON, Edward J.: Ottomans and Armenians. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GORECZKY Tamás: Egy görög-török konfliktus története a 19. századból - az 1896-97-es krétai válság az osztrák-magyar diplomáciai iratok tükrében http://real.mtak.hu/19319/1/17-GoretzkyTamas.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and this led to the strengthening of Turkish nationalism as a result. The nationalist movement of the [[Young Turks]] aimed for a secularized nation-state, and constitutional government in a parliamentary democracy.

The political party of the Young Turks, the [[Committee of Union and Progress]], embraced Turanism, and a glorification of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] ethnic identity, and was devoted to protecting the Turkic peoples living under foreign rule (most of them under Russian rule as a result of Russia's enormous territorial expansion during the 18th and 19th centuries), and to restoring the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s shattered national pride.&lt;ref&gt;Caravans to Oblivion: The Armenian Genocide, 1915 (Hardcover) by G. S. Graber&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish version of pan-Turanianism was summed up by American politicians at the time of first world war as follows: "It has been shown above that the Turkish version of pan-Turanianism contains two general ideas: (a) To purify and strengthen the Turkish nationality within the Ottoman Empire, and (b) to link up the Ottoman Turks with the other Turks in the world. These objects were first pursued in the cultural sphere by a private group of 'Intellectuals', and promoted by peaceful propaganda. After 1913, they took on a political form and were incorporated in the programme of the C.U.P.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=President (1913–1921 : Wilson). The Inquiry. 1917-12/1918|title=Records of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace, 1914 – 1931|publisher=Series: Special Reports and Studies, 1917 – 1918 Record Group 256: Records of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace, 1914 – 1931|page=7|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/27015264|date=1917–1918|series=Series: Special Reports and Studies, 1917 - 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Ottoman defeat in World War I briefly undermined the notion of pan-Turanianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Current History| publisher = [[New York Times Company]]| volume = 11| date = 1920| location = New York City| pages = 335| url = https://books.google.com/?id=JapDAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War I, Turkish nationalists and Turanists joined the [[Basmachi movement]] of Turkic peoples, to help their struggle against Russians. The most prominent amongst them was [[Enver Pasha]], the former Ottoman war minister.

Turanism forms an important aspect of the [[ideology]] of the modern Turkish [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP), whose youth movement is informally known as the [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]]. Grey Wolf (the mother wolf [[Asena]]) was the main symbol of the ancient [[Turkic peoples]].

=== Japan ===
Japanese Turanism was based upon the same footing as its European counterparts. The Austrian German philologist Johann Anton Boller (1811–1869) was the first who systematically tried to prove the Ural-Altaic affiliation of the Japanese language.&lt;ref&gt;BOLLER, Johann Anton: Nachweis, dass das Japanische zum ural-altaischen Stamme gehört. 1857. http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10572378_00001.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese linguist Fujioka Katsuji (1872–1935) put forward a set of mainly typological characteristics linking Japanese to the Ural-Altaic family.&lt;ref&gt;SHIBATANI Masayoshi: The languages of Japan. 1990. p.96&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Japanese as a Ural-Altaic language was  quite widely accepted prior to the second world war. At present, Japanese is the only major language in the world whose genetic affiliation to other languages or language families has not been adequately proven.

Japanese is now thought to be related to [[Southeast Asia|southeast asian]] languages ([[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] or [[Austric languages]]) by some linguists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Vovin,|title=Proto-Japanese beyond the accent system|url=https://www.academia.edu/19253123|journal=Current Issues in Linguistic Theory|pages=141–156|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jäger|first=Gerhard|date=2015-10-13|title=Support for linguistic macrofamilies from weighted sequence alignment|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4611657/|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=112|issue=41|pages=12752–12757|doi=10.1073/pnas.1500331112|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4611657|pmid=26403857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and 30s Turanism got some backing in Japan, mostly amongst the military elite and intelligentsia. Japanese Turanists claimed that Japanese have an Inner Asian descent, and the progenitors of the Japanese people migrated from Central Asia to conquer the Japanese islands. Kitagawa Shikazō (1886–1943) asserted that the Japanese had descended from the Tungusic branch of the Turanian family, just like the Koreans and Manchus, whose origin had been in north-east China, Manchuria. And, since Japanese, Koreans and Manchus derived from a Tungusic origin, they also had a bond with other Turanian sub-ethnicities like Turks, Mongols, Samoyeds and Finno-Ugrians in terms of blood, language and culture.&lt;ref name="Sinan Levent"/&gt; The first-ever Japanese Turanist organization, the Turanian National Alliance – ''Tsuran Minzoku Domei'' (ツラン民族同盟), was established in Tokyo in 1921, by Juichiro Imaoka  (1888–1973) and the Hungarian Orientalist and ethnographer Benedek Baráthosi Balogh (1870–1945).&lt;ref name="Sinan Levent"/&gt; Other organisations like the Turanian Society of Japan – ''Nippon Tsuran Kyoukai'' (early 1930s) and the Japanese-Hungarian Cultural Association – ''Nikko Bunka Kyoukai'' (1938) were founded too. A pro-Finnish activity was carried in Japan in the interwar period by some Japanese nationalists influenced by Turanism. It found theoretical expression in, for example, a book entitled ''Hann tsuranizumu to keizai burokku'' (''Pan-Turanism and the Economic Bloc''), written by an economist. The writer insists that the Japanese should leave the tragically small Japanese islands and resettle to the northern and western parts of the Asian continent, where their forefathers had once dwelt. For this purpose, they had to reconquer these ancestral lands from the Slavs by entering into alliance with the Turanian peoples. The Finns, one of those peoples, were to take a share of this great achievement.&lt;ref&gt;MOMOSE Hiroshi: Japan's Relations with Finland 1919–1944, as Reflected by Japanese Source Materials. http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/5026/1/KJ00000112960.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Turanian kinship along with an anti-communist stance were seen as justification for Japan’s intervention in the [[Japanese intervention in Siberia|Russian]] and [[Chinese Civil War]], and for the creation of a Japanese sphere of interest, through the creation of new Japanese vassal states in North-East Asia. After the creation of  [[Manchukuo]] and [[Mengjiang]], Japan pushed for further expansion in the [[Mongolian People's Republic]], but after the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Nomonhan Incident]] gave up on those plans, and concluded the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] with the Soviet Union in 1941. 

After Khalkin Gol, the Japanese turned towards South-East Asia and the Pacific [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|under a pan-Asianist agenda]].&lt;ref&gt;“Many Japanese thinkers expressed themselves in pan-Asian terms, in terms of hegemony in East Asia. Obviously, Japan’s pride in her achievement within a relatively short period of sixty years meant that many Japanese thought of their country as the natural leader of East Asia. And the doctrines of the New Order in East Asia and later the Great East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere — imprecise as they were in many respects — were a natural development of this form of nationalism.” in: LEIFER, Michael ed.: Asian Nationalism. 2002. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Turanist organisations were disbanded during the [[Pacific War]] by an imperial law promoting the Pan-Asian agenda.
