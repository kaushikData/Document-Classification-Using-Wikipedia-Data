'''3HO (Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization)''', also known as Sikh Dharma of the Western Hemisphere or Sikh Dharma International, is an American [[Sects of Sikhism|sect of Sikhism]] that started about 1970. It was founded in the West by [[Harbhajan Singh Khalsa]], also called "Yogi Bhajan". Its followers are primarily Americans.&lt;ref name="Nesbitt2016p101"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor Nesbitt|title=Sikhism: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zD8SDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-106277-3|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britsikhsects&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sikhism/Sects-and-other-groups Sects in Sikhism], Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fenech8"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

Orthodox Sikhs, including the Sikh leadership in [[Amritsar]], do not consider 3HO as Sikhs.&lt;ref name=britsikhsects/&gt;&lt;ref name="Takhar2016p161"/&gt; 3HO consider the teachings of Yogi Bhajan as authoritative as the ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'', which Sikhs consider as heresy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Practices==
The 3HO movement is known for including some practices found in certain traditions of [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref name="Nayar2004p127"/&gt; such as vegetarianism, meditation and Yoga, particularly [[Kundalini yoga]].&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Takhar2016p161"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britsikhsects"/&gt; 3HO also believes openness to Yoga and spiritual ideas as a source of strength.&lt;ref name="Nayar2004p127"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamala Elizabeth Nayar|title=The Sikh Diaspora in Vancouver: Three Generations Amid Tradition, Modernity, and Multiculturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NShXfaNbRyEC&amp;pg=PA127 |year=2004|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8631-0|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jakobsh | first=Doris | title=3HO/Sikh Dharma of the Western Hemisphere: The Forgotten New Religious Movement? | journal=Religion Compass | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | volume=2 | issue=3 | year=2008 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-8171.2008.00068.x | pages=385–408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women wear turbans and often wear white clothes.&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p9"/&gt;

==Reception==
In 1977, Gurucharan Singh Tohra, former President of the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC), stated that Harbhajan Singh was not the leader of Sikhism in the Western World as he claimed, and denied Singh's claim that the SGPC had given him the title of Siri Singh Sahib.&lt;ref name=time&gt;

==Governance and Control==
Yogi Bhajan formed Sikh Dharma International as a California nonprofit religious corporation “organized to advance the religion of Sikh Dharma and as an association of religious organizations teaching principles of Sikh Dharma, including by ordination of ministers of divinity and operation of places of worship.” During Yogi Bhajan's lifetime, Sikh Dharma International, along with related legal entities Siri Singh Sahib Corporation and Unto Infinity LLC, were held and controlled by Siri Singh Sahib of Sikh Dharma, a California "corporation sole" of which Yogi Bhajan was the only shareholder.&lt;ref name="9thCir"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Puri v. Khalsa |vol=844 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1152 |pinpoint=slip op. at 5-9, 33 |court=9th Cir. |date=2017 |url=https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/01/06/13-36024.pdf |accessdate=2018-11-08 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Yogi's death in 2004, a dispute ensued over the governance of those entities and assets. Yogi Bhajan's wife, Bibiji Inderjit Kaur Puri, alleged that she had been appointed to the board of Unto Infinity, and that she and their three children were appointed to the Siri Singh Sahib of Sikh Dharma board of directors (and thus in a position to exert significant control over all of the Sikh Dharma legal entities); but that following Yogi Bhajan's death the other board members of those entities improperly prevented them from taking part in governance. In January 2017, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the lawsuit was not on its face an ecclesiastical dispute.&lt;ref name="9thCir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pein |first=Corey |date=2011-08-24 |title=Death of a Yogi |url=http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/article-6242-death-of-a-yogi.html |newspaper=Santa Fe Reporter |location=Santa Fe, New Mexico |access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pein"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pein |first=Corey |date=2010-07-07 |title=Khalsa vs. Khalsa |url=http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/article-5502-khalsa-vs-khalsa.html |newspaper=Santa Fe Reporter |location=Santa Fe, New Mexico |access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April 2018, Chief Judge Michael Mosman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon dismissed the case.&lt;ref name="bernstein"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bernstein |first=Maxine |date=2018-04-27 |title=Judge dismisses lawsuit over rulership of Sikh business empire |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2018/04/judge_dismisses_lawsuit_over_r.html |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |location=Portland, Oregon |access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it appeared that certain governance documents had been falsified after Yogi Bhajan's death to appear to have been signed before he died,&lt;ref name="Dismissal"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Puri v. Khalsa |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint=D. Ore. No. 3:10-cv-1532, Dkt. 436 |court=D.

At present, Sikh Dharma International is governed by the Khalsa Council appointed by the Siri Singh Sahib, Yogi Bhajan. The Council is composed of Golden Temple CEO Kartar Singh Khalsa; his domestic partner, Peraim Kaur Khalsa, who was also a member of Yogi Bhajan’s personal staff; Sikh Dharma’s longtime comptroller, Sopurkh Kaur Khalsa; and the organization’s strategic and legal planner, Siri Karm Kaur Khalsa, a New Mexico resident. The Khalsa Council does not recognize Yogi Bhajan's family as members of the organization or its governing group.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; The Khalsa Coucil appoints a Board of Directors for Sikh Dharma International. {{As of|January 2017}} the current Board of Directors comprises Siri Sikdar Sahiba, Sardarni Guru Amrit Kaur Khalsa, MA; Bhai Sahiba, Bibiji Inderjit Kaur Khalsa, PhD; MSS Guru Raj Kaur Khalsa; SS Guru Darbar Singh Khalsa; Sada Sat Simran Singh Khalsa; SS SatSundri Kaur Khalsa; SS Siri Karm Singh Khalsa; and Board chairman MSS Kirtan-Singh Khalsa. SS SatSundri Kaur Khalsa also provides oversight of the associated Sikh businesses of Yogi Tea and Akal Security.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sikhdharma.org/international-khalsa-council/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sikhdharma.org/board-members-and-officers/ |title=Board of Directors - Sikh Dharma International |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Sikh Dharma International |access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Ventures==
According to anthropology professor and Sikh diaspora researcher Nicola Mooney, 3HO Sikhs have combined "ethic and capitalism" to their spiritual pursuits, with Sikh Dharma International and its associated corporate entities and directors creating and controlling the [[Yogi Tea]] and [[Akal Security]] brands with a worldwide presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mooney | first=Nicola | title=READING WEBER AMONG THE SIKHS: ASCETICISM AND CAPITALISM IN THE 3HO/SIKH DHARMA | journal=Sikh Formations | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | volume=8 | issue=3 | year=2012 | doi=10.1080/17448727.2012.745305 | pages=417–436}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Golden Temple of Oregon, a natural foods company that built the Peace Cereal and [[Yogi Tea]] brands, was owned by a corporate entity controlled by Yogi Bhajan, and was estimated to be worth around $100,000,000 at the time of his death. The company was transferred to Kartar Singh Khalsa for $100, sparking lawsuits over improper disposition of the assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Culverwell |first=Wendy |date=2012-02-24 |title=Schwabe Williamson sued for $230M in Yogi Bhajan-related suit |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/2012/02/suits-fly-when-100m-company-sold-for.html |newspaper=Portland Business Journal |location=Portland, Oregon |access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Buri McDonald |first=Sherri |date=2010-12-14 |title=Yogi's widow sues managers |url=http://projects.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/web/business/25663938-41/golden-temple-infinity-khalsa-lawsuit.csp |newspaper=The Register-Guard |location=Eugene, Oregon |access-date=2017-01-17 |quote=The widow’s lawsuit, which was filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court in Portland, alleges that Unto Infinity authorized raises and perks for its members, including boosting Khalsa’s salary from $125,000 in 2002 to $850,000 in 2008. . . Hers is the third lawsuit to accuse Unto Infinity members of breaking their fiduciary duty to safeguard the Sikh Dharma community’s assets and of personally profiting instead. The other two lawsuits — one filed by Sikh Dharma ministers and the other by Oregon Attorney General John Kroger — were consolidated earlier this month.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golden Temple's cereal division was sold to Hearthside Food Solutions in May 2010 for $71 million; the executives were later ordered to return more than half of the sale price to a court-appointed receiver. Hearthside was later acquired by [[Post Holdings|Post]]. Golden Temple was renamed East West Tea Company after that sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012-06-19 |title=Golden Temple execs must return $36 million |url=http://www.oregonbusiness.com/article/item/7603-golden-temple-execs-must-return-36-million |newspaper=Oregon Business |location=Portland, Oregon |access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another SDI-related company, [[Akal Security]], initially hired 3HO members to guard shops and restaurants. It grew into a $500 million-a-year company with federal contracts to protect numerous government buildings in Washington, DC and elsewhere, including courthouses, airports, and embassies. The founders donated the company to the church in 1980.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;

Following the death of Yogi Bhajan, control over Golden Temple and Akal Security was contested in a series of lawsuits in Oregon. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bernstein |first=Maxine |date=2017-01-09 |title=Long court battle over Sikh business empire takes another turn |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2017/01/can_a_dispute_over_management.html |newspaper=The Oregonian |location=Portland, Oregon |access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuits ended in 2018,&lt;ref name="Dismissal"/&gt; leaving both companies under the control of the board members of the main 3HO religious organization, Sikh Dharma International.

"'''American Jesus'''" is the first single by [[Bad Religion]] from their 1993 album ''[[Recipe for Hate]]''. It was their second all-time single since their signing to [[Atlantic Records]]. [[Eddie Vedder]] of [[Pearl Jam]] provides backing vocals on the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=eddie_vedder|title=Eddie Vedder - The Answer - The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
"American Jesus" takes on the idea that God favors America, rather than other countries. [[Greg Graffin]] said "During the [[Gulf War]], [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]] said, 'We'll win, because God is on our side!'. What an amazing statement!" The song touches on antisemitism, war, and religion as an excuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/media/item.asp?itemID=500|title=Hate Core! {{!}} Media {{!}} The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995|website=www.thebrpage.net|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The video is entirely in sepia tone. It shows the band driving around in a car through L.A. with various civilians carrying crosses around the city with blindfolds on. The video cuts to clips of the band performing in the desert as well as Graffin walking through the city. It ends with the civilians chanting "one nation, under god" while standing in a row.

'''Antônio de Castro Mayer''' (20 June 1904 – 25 April 1991) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[prelate]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. A [[Traditionalist Catholic]] and ally of [[Marcel Lefebvre|Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre]], he was [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Campos|Campos]] from 1949 until his resignation in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|bishop|bcasmay|Bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer|21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, he incurred the automatic canonical penalty of [[excommunication]] for participating in the [[Ecône consecrations|illicit consecration of four bishops]] of the [[Society of St. Pius X]] (SSPX).  This penalty also applied to Archbishop Lefebvre and the four bishops that they ordained. However a subsequent public declaration of the penalty by the [[Holy See]] omitted his name, identifying only Archbishop Lefebvre and the four bishops whom they ordained. This was only one of several inconsistencies in the process.  In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI lifted the canonical penalty incurred by the four surviving bishops in the hope of facilitating full reconciliation of the SSPX.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0900355.htm Pope lifts excommunications of Lefebvrite bishops]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Antônio de Castro Mayer was born in [[Campinas]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], to Joao Mayer, a [[Bavaria]]n [[Stonemasonry|stonemason]], and his wife, Francisca de Castro, a [[Brazil]]ian [[peasant]]. One of twelve children, Antônio helped his mother support their family after Joao died in 1910. At age 12, he entered [[São Paulo]]'s [[minor seminary]], then run by the [[Premonstratensian|Premonstratensian Fathers]]. After entering the [[Seminary|major seminary]] in 1922, he was sent to study at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] (from where he obtained his [[Doctor of Theology|doctorate in theology]] in 1928) in [[Rome]]. Mayer was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] by [[Basilio Pompili|Basilio Cardinal Pompili]] on 30 October 1927, and then taught [[philosophy]], history of philosophy, and [[dogmatic theology]] at the seminary in São Paulo.

Before being named [[Vicar general|Vicar General]] of São Paulo in 1942, he became Assistant General of the city's [[Catholic Action]] in 1940 and a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the [[cathedral]] [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] (with the title of First Treasurer) in 1941. He was made a [[Curate|parish priest]] and the [[prefect]] of studies at the [[Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo|Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo]] in 1945.

On 6 March 1948, De Castro Mayer was appointed [[Coadjutor bishop|Coadjutor Bishop]] of [[Campos dos Goytacazes|Campos]] and [[Titular bishop|Titular Bishop]] of ''Priene'' by [[Pope Pius XII]]. He received his [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopal consecration]] on the following 23 May from Archbishop [[Carlo Chiarlo]], with Bishop Ernesto de Paula and Archbishop [[Geraldo de Proença Sigaud]], [[Divine Word Missionaries|S.V.D.]], serving as [[Consecrator|co-consecrators]]. He succeeded Octaviano de Albuquerque as [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of Campos on January 3, 1949, and was very active in combating [[liberation theology]] and communist infiltration of the Church and of his diocese.

In 1968, the Catholic conservative group [[Tradition, Family and Property]] organized a campaign to collect signatures denouncing what were perceived as leftists in the Church. De Castro Mayer lent encouragement to the campaign. Later the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil declared that TFP was neither recognized by the hierarchy nor considered an official Catholic organization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rElMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=Ant%C3%B4nio+de+Castro+Mayer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiThPnxk5_QAhUIw4MKHUOBD7s4HhDoAQgfMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Ant%C3%B4nio%20de%20Castro%20Mayer&amp;f=false Klaiber, Jeffrey.

De Castro Mayer, a staunch [[Traditionalist Catholic|traditionalist]], refused to implement the reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in his diocese. Until his resignation on 29 August 1981, the [[Tridentine Mass]] continued throughout the Campos diocese, along with all the other traditional Catholic practices and devotions. He continued this even after resigning as diocesan ordinary and being succeeded by Bishop Carlos Navarro. He was able to maintain a completely traditionalist "diocese" within a diocese, with around 40,000 faithful, which he organized in parallel chapels. (The diocese itself, without the followers of Bishop Castro Mayer, had some 850,000 Catholics.) This organisation was called the [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney|Priestly Society of Saint John Mary Vianney]].  Under the leadership of his successor, Bishop [[Licínio Rangel]], this organization was subsequently reconciled to the Catholic Church and reconstituted as the present [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney]], with the same territory as the Diocese of Campos, Brazil, by Pope John Paul II in January 2002.

On his death bed, Bishop de Castro Mayer refused to sign a so-called ''"formula of reconciliation"'' (which would include an admission that excommunication was really incurred and that no situation of necessity, as claimed by Lefebvre and Castro Mayer, had existed in 1988) proposed by Vatican delegates at his death bed.  He died of [[respiratory failure]] in [[Campos dos Goytacazes|Campos]] on 25 April 1991.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

{{primary sources|date=August 2015}}
'''Apostasy''' in [[Christianity]] is the rejection of Christianity by someone who formerly was a [[Christian]]. The term [[apostasy]] comes from the Greek word ''apostasia'' ("[[Wiktionary:ἀποστασία|ἀποστασία]]") meaning defection, departure, revolt or rebellion.  It has been described as "a willful falling away from, or rebellion against, Christianity. Apostasy is the rejection of Christ by one who has been a Christian...."&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Muller, ''Dictionary of Greek and Latin Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology'', 41. "Apostasy is generally defined as the determined, willful rejection of Christ and His teachings by a Christian believer (Heb. 10:26-29; . . .)(''Nelson's New Illustrated Bible Dictionary: Completely Revised and Updated Edition'' by Ronald F. Youngblood (Editor) [Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1995], 91). ''The Tyndale Bible Dictionary'' defines apostasy as a "Turning against God, as evidenced by abandonment and repudiation of former beliefs. The term generally refers to a deliberate renouncing of the faith by a once sincere believer . . ." ("Apostasy," Walter A. Elwell and Philip W. Comfort, editors, 95). ''Holman Treasury of Key Bible Words'': "People who commit apostasy abandon their faith and repudiate their former beliefs. . . . Apostasy is a complete and final rejection of God" ("Apostasy," Eugene E. Carpenter &amp; Philip W. Comfort, 227). ''The Dictionary of Christian Theology'' (edited by Alan Richardson) says apostasy "means the deliberate disavowal of belief in Christ made by a formerly believing Christian" ("Apostasy," R.P.C. Hanson; The Westminster Press, 1969, 12). ''Baker's Dictionary of Theology'' (editor in chief Everett F. Harrison) "Cremer states that ''apostasia'' is used in the absolute sense of 'passing over to unbelief,' thus a dissolution of the 'union with God subsisting through faith in Christ'" ("Apostasy," Robert Winston Ross [Baker Book House, 1976], 57).&lt;/ref&gt; "Apostasy is a theological category describing those who have voluntarily and consciously abandoned their faith in the God of the covenant, who manifests himself most completely in [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]."&lt;ref&gt;Scot McKnight, ''Dictionary of Theological Interpretation of the Bible'', "Apostasy," 58. "[Apostasy] is the deliberate denial, expressed by outward acts, of the Christian faith . . . . The passages of Scripture on which the treatment of this form of apostasy is based on are Heb. 3:12; 6:4-9; 10:16-29; 2 Pet. 2:15-21; 2 John 9-11; Luke 12:9" (E. Friedberg [contributor] ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'' [New York: Funk and Wagnalls Company, 1908], 1:239).&lt;/ref&gt; "Apostasy is the antonym of conversion; it is deconversion."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

According to B. J. Oropeza, the warning passages in the [[New Testament]] describe at least three dangers which could lead a Christian to commit apostasy:&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Oropeza, "Apostasy and Perseverance in Church History" in ''Paul and Apostasy: Eschatology, Perseverance, and Falling Away in the Corinthian Congregation'' (Tübingen: Mohr-Siebeck, 2000), 2. Other signs of apostasy include loss of belief, personal suffering and hardships, malaise, and negligence towards the things of God (such as found in certain of the churches in Revelation), according to Oropeza's conclusion in ''Apostasy in the New Testament Communities'' (3 vols.; Eugene: Cascade, 2011-12), 3.236-41. Paul Barnett provides four reasons for apostasy: (1) Moral or Spiritual Failure; (2) Persecution; (3) False Teaching; (4) Self-Choice (''Dictionary of the Later New Testament'', 75)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'''Temptations:''' Christians were tempted to engage in various vices that were a part of their lives before they became Christians (idolatry, sexual immorality, covetousness, etc.).
:'''Deceptions:''' Christians encountered various [[Heresy in Christianity|heresies]] and false teachings spread by false teachers and prophets that threatened to seduce them away from their pure devotion to Christ.
:'''Persecutions:''' [[Persecution of Christians|Christians were persecuted]] by the governing powers of the day for their allegiance to Christ. Many Christians were threatened with certain [[Christian martyrs|death]] if they would not deny Christ.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Persecution  is highlighted in the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] and the [[First Epistle of Peter]]. The issue of false teachers/teachings is found in the [[Epistles of John|Johannine]] and [[Pauline epistles]], in the [[Second Epistle of Peter]] and the [[Epistle of Jude]]. A number of sections in the writings of Paul and James focus on [[vice]]s and [[virtue]]s. "These and other early texts helped to shape the trajectory of Christian response to the phenomenon of defection in the post-apostolic era. The Christians were to persevere through various types of opposition, standing firm against temptation, false doctrine, hardships and persecution."&lt;ref&gt;Oropeza, ''Paul and Apostasy'', 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek noun ''apostasia'' (rebellion, abandonment, state of apostasy, defection)&lt;ref&gt;Walter Bauder, "Fall, Fall Away," ''The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology'' (''NIDNTT''), 1:606.&lt;/ref&gt; is found only twice in the New Testament ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 21:21; [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians|2 Thessalonians]] 2:3).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Fink, "Apostasy," in the ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', 87. In Acts 21:21, "Paul was falsely accused of teaching the Jews apostasy from Moses . . . [and] he predicted the great apostasy from Christianity, foretold by Jesus (Matthew 24:10–12), which would precede 'the Day of the Lord' (2 Thessalonians 2:2f.)" (D. M. Pratt, ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', "Apostasy," 1:192).&lt;/ref&gt; However, "the concept of apostasy is found throughout Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', 1:192. ''Holman Treasury of Key Bible Words'': "Many New Testament passages, using different words, convey warnings against apostasy" ("Apostasy," Carpenter &amp; Comfort, 227).&lt;/ref&gt; The related verb ''aphistēmi'' (go away, withdraw, depart, fall away)&lt;ref&gt;Bauder, ''NIDNTT'', 1:606&lt;/ref&gt; carries considerable theological significance in three passages (Luke 8:13; 1 Timothy 4:1; Hebrews 3:12).&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Biblical Library: Greek English Dictionary'', ''apostasia'', 10:394, and ''aphistēmi'', 10:506. "In the LXX it [''aphistēmi''] is frequently a technical term for apostasy (from God), e.g., Deut 32:15; Jer 3:14; cf. also 1QS 7:18, 23" (''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament'', 1:183).&lt;/ref&gt;

:* '''Luke 8:11–13''' – Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a while, and in time of testing fall away. (ESV)&lt;ref&gt;"The Greek verb [''aphistēmi''] is related to the noun that means 'apostasy'; it means to abandon, to defect, to forsake. Here it is to lose faith in the Christian message, to quit believing" (Robert G. Bratcher, ''A Translator's Guide to the Gospel of Luke'', 132). Timothy Friberg, Barbara Friberg, Neva F. Miller: "in a religious sense ''fall away, become apostate'' (Luke 8:13)" (''Analytical Lexicon of the Greek New Testament'', 84). Hermann Cremer: "to denote religious apostasy, in contrast to πιστεύειν [believe/trust], Luke 8:13. . . . Thus [''aphistēmi''] = ''to dissolve the union formed with God by faith and obedience''" (''Biblico-Theological Lexicon of the New Testament Greek'', 308).&lt;/ref&gt;

But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called "today," that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.

Ed., ''Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words'', ''aphistēmi'', 1103). "To make defection from, to revolt, to apostatize, (Luke 8:13; 1 Tim. 4:1; Heb. 3:12)" (''Strong's Complete Word Study Concordance'', Expanded Edition, Editor: Warren Baker, ''aphistēmi'', 2039).&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

In ''The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology'', Wolfgang Bauder writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1 Timothy 4:1 describes "falling away from the faith" in the last days in terms of falling into false, heretical beliefs. Lk. 8:13 probably refers to apostasy as a result of eschatological temptation. Here are people who have come to believe, who have received the gospel "with joy." But under the pressure of persecution and tribulation arising because of the faith, they break off the relationship with God into which they have entered. According to Hebrews 3:12, apostasy consists in an unbelieving and self-willed movement away from God (in contrast to Hebrews 3:14), which must be prevented at all costs. ''aphistēmi'' thus connotes in the passages just mentioned the serious situation of becoming separated from the living God after a previous turning towards him, by falling away from the faith. It is a movement of unbelief and sin, which can also be expressed by other words (cf. the par. to Luke 8:13 in Matthew 13:21; Mark 4:17; . . .). Expressions equivalent in meaning to the warning in 1 Timothy 4:1 include ''nauageō'', suffer shipwreck, 1:19; ''astocheō'' miss the mark, 1:6; 6:21; 2 Timothy 2:18; cf. also ''aperchomai'', go away, John 6:66; ''apostrephō'', turn away; ''arneomai'', deny; ''metatithēmi'', change, alter; ''mē menein'', do not abide, John 15:6; . . .  [see also] the pictures of defection in Matthew 24:9–12, and Revelation 13."&lt;ref&gt;''NIDNTT'', 1:607-608. I. Howard Marshall says ''piptō'', to fall (Romans 11:11, 22; 1 Corinthians 10:12; Hebrews 4:11); ''parapiptō'', to fall away, transgress (Hebrews 6:6), ''pararrheō'', to drift away (Hebrews 2:1); and ''skandalizō/skandalon'', to stumble, offend (John 6:61; 16:1) are also expressions connected to the concept of apostasy (''Kept by the Power of God'', 217, note 4).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wolfgang Bauder goes on add that ''piptō'', fall (1 Corinthians 10:12; Hebrews 4:11), and ''ekpiptō'', fall off or from (Galatians 5:4; 2 Peter 3:17), is used figuratively in the New Testament to refer to "the consequent loss of salvation, rather than of a mere failure from which recovery can be made. It is a catastrophic fall, which means eternal ruin. If it were not so, all the warnings against falling would lose their threatening urgency. To fall into sin and guilt, as an expression of a total attitude, is to plunge into irrevocable misfortune."&lt;ref&gt;''NIDNTT'', 1:610-611&lt;/ref&gt;

The following passages where the verb ''skandalizō'' ("fall away from faith")&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Giesen, ''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament'', 3:248. Nigel Turner says, "A look at the New Testament and patristic phenomena reveals that the meaning is two-fold, 'either to put someone off from becoming a believer or to cause a believer to fall away. The scandal of the Cross is an instance of the first meaning, to cause to apostatize an instance of the second' [quoting from G. D. Kilpatrick, ''Journal of Theological Studies'' NS 10 (1959), p. 129]. (''Christian Words'' [T. Nelson Publishers, 1981], Offence: ''skandalizō''; ''skandalon'', 294 and 304, fn. 5).&lt;/ref&gt; and the noun ''skandalon'' ("enticement to unbelief, cause of salvation's loss, seduction"):&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Giesen, ''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament'', 3:249.&lt;/ref&gt; are theologically important as well:&lt;ref&gt;I. Howard Marshall, ''Kept by the Power of God: A Study of Perseverance and Falling Away'', 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

But I say to you that everyone looking at a woman so as to desire her already committed adultery with her in his heart. And if your right eye is causing you to fall [''skandalizō''], tear it out and throw it from you. For it is better for you that one of your body-parts perish and your whole body not be thrown into Gehenna.

:* '''Matthew 13:40-42''' – [Jesus is talking to his disciples] Therefore, just as the darnel is collected and burned up with fire, so it will be at the conclusion of the age. The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will collect out of His kingdom all the causes-of-falling [''skandalon''] and the ones doing lawlessness. And they will throw them into the furnace of fire. In that place, there will be the weeping and the grinding of teeth. (DLNT)&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Stählin: In Matt. 13:41 . . . [''skandalon''] here, and only here in the New Testament, is patently used of persons. The Old Testament ring of the second member (transgressor of the Law) suggests that [''skandalon''] are those who seduce into breaking the Law. In the New Testament interpretation they are those who lead into sin and apostasy . . . . As the [weeds] are sown by the devil (v. 39, cf. 15:13), so the [''skandalon''] are the devil's children (cf. John 8:38, 41, 44; 1 John 3:10) who work against God in the kingdom of the Son of Man (Matt. 13:41) and try to cause as many as possible to fall. Their end will come with that of the devil and his hosts (on v. 42 cf. Rev. 20:10). The counterpart (cf. v. 30) to the gathering out of the [''skandalon''] from the kingdom of the Son of Man is the gathering of the elect from all the kingdoms of the world (Matt. 24:31), both by angels. (''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament'', 7:346-347) Nigel Turner: "To be a ''skandalon'' is to achieve the moral ruin of another person. . . . The angels will gather the offenders [i.e., ''skandalon''] out of the Kingdom and [throw them] into the fire (Matt 18:6f.; 13:41; Mark 9:42; Luke 17:1f.)" (''Christian Words'', 296).&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Matthew 18:6-9''' – [Jesus is talking to his disciples] But whoever causes one of these little ones believing in Me to fall [''skandalizō'']—it would be better for him that a donkey’s millstone be hung around his neck and he be sunk in the deep part of the sea. Woe to the world because of the causes-of-falling [''skandalon'']. For it is a necessity that causes-of-falling [''skandalon''] should come; nevertheless, woe to the person through whom the cause-of-falling [''skandalon''] comes. But if your hand or your foot is causing you to fall [''skandalizō''], cut it off and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than to be thrown into the eternal fire having two hands or two feet. And if your eye is causing you to fall [''skandalizō''], tear it out and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter into life one-eyed than to be thrown into the Gehenna of fire having two eyes. (DLNT)&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Stählin: Both woes [in Matt. 18:7] show how terribly dangerous [''skandalon''] are. At issue are the loss of eternal salvation and eternal perdition. (''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament'', 7:347)&lt;/ref&gt;

They will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. And then many will fall away [''skandalizō''] and betray one another and hate one another. . . . But the one who endures to the end will be saved. (ESV)
:* ''' Mark 4:16-17''' – These are the ones sown on rocky ground: As soon as they hear the word, they receive it with joy. But they have no root in themselves and do not endure. Then, when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away [''skandalizō'']. (NET)
:* '''Mark 9:42-48''' – [Jesus is talking to his disciples] And whoever causes one of these little ones believing in Me to fall [''skandalizō'']—it would be better for him if instead a donkey's millstone were lying around his neck, and he had been thrown into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Stählin: In Mark 9:42 (which has come down to us in all three Gospels . . .), the point is the avoidance of [''skandalon'']. This is again an eschatological saying, for the one thing more terrible than being drowned with a mill-stone about one's neck is damnation at the Last Judgment. The punishment fits the offence. [''skandalon''] means "to cause loss of faith," i.e., "to rob of eternal salvation." Thus the [''skandalon''] is himself plunged into eternal perdition. (''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament'', 7:351)&lt;/ref&gt; And if your hand should be causing you to fall [''skandalizō''], cut it off. It is better that you enter into life crippled than go into Gehenna having two hands—into the inextinguishable fire. And if your foot should be causing you to fall [''skandalizō''], cut it off. It is better that you enter into life lame than be thrown into Gehenna having two feet. And if your eye should be causing you to fall [''skandalizō''], throw it out. It is better that you enter into the kingdom of God one-eyed than be thrown into Gehenna having two eyes—where their worm does not come to an end, and the fire is not quenched. (DLNT)&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bromiley: A similar eschatological light falls on Mark 9:43ff.; Matt. 5:29-30; 18:8-9. The meaning of ''skandalízō'' here is "to entice into sin" and therefore to plunge into unbelief and perdition. No price is too high to avoid this; hence the relentless demand of Jesus. (Geoffrey W. Bromiley, trans., Gerhard Kittel, Gerhard Friedrich, ed., ''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume'', 1037-1038)&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* '''Luke 17:1-2''' – And He said to His disciples, "It is impossible that the causes-of-falling [''skandalon''] should not come. Nevertheless, woe to the one through whom they come.

:* ''' John 15:18, 20, 27, 16:1''' – [Jesus is talking to his disciples] If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. . . .

And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning. I have said all these things to you to keep you from falling away [''skandalizō'']. (ESV)
:* '''Romans 14:13-15, 20''' – Therefore let us no longer be judging one another. But rather judge this: not to be placing an opportunity for stumbling or a cause-of-falling [''skandalon''] for the brother. (I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is defiled in itself, except to the one considering anything to be defiled—to that one it is defiled). For if your brother is grieved because of food, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not be destroying with your food that one for whom Christ died. . . . Do not be tearing-down the work of God for the sake of food. (DLNT)&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bromiley: Tensions in the churches are the occasion of ''skándalon'' (cf. the debates between the strong and the weak in Rom. 14-15 and 1 Cor. 8:1ff.; 10:23ff.). The freedom of those who have fully cast off the past causes offense to those who have not, but it also creates the danger that these will act against their consciences or with wavering faith. In this case the danger is the serious one of an ultimate eschatological fall (Rom. 14:15, 23). The strong with their freedom may destroy the weak [v. 15] and therefore overturn God's work in Christ [v. 20]. Paul, then, sides with the weak even though he shares the faith of the strong (Rom. 15:1). (''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume'', 1038)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Romans 16:17-18''' – Now I urge you, brothers, to be watching-out-for the ones producing the dissensions and the causes-of-falling [''skandalon''] contrary to the teaching which you learned, and be turning away from them. For such ones are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own stomach. And by smooth-talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the guileless ones. (DLNT)
:* '''1 Corinthians 8:9-13''' – But be watching-out that this right of yours does not somehow become an opportunity-for-stumbling to the weak ones. For if someone sees you, the one having knowledge, reclining [to eat] in an idol-temple, will not his conscience, being weak, be built-up so as to eat the foods-sacrificed-to-idols? For the one being weak is being destroyed by your knowledge—the brother for the sake of whom Christ died! And in this manner sinning against the brothers and striking their conscience while being weak, you are sinning against Christ. For-this-very-reason, if food causes my brother to fall [''skandalizō''], I will never eat meats, ever—in-order-that I may not cause my brother to fall [''skandalizō'']. (DLNT)
:* '''1 John 2:9-11''' – The one claiming to be in the light and hating his brother is in the darkness until now. The one loving his brother is abiding in the light, and there is no cause-of-falling [''skandalon''] in him. But the one hating his brother is in the darkness, and is walking in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness blinded his eyes. (DLNT)
:* '''Revelation 2:14''' – [Jesus is talking to the church in Pergamum] But I have a few things against you, because you have there ones holding on to the teaching of Balaam, who was teaching Balak to put a cause-of-falling [''skandalon''] before the sons of Israel to eat foods sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual-immorality. (DLNT)&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bromiley: False teachers [in Rom. 16:17 f.] cause both divisions and ''skándala'', which are probably temptations to abandon sound doctrine. A similar use of ''skándalon'' occurs in Rev. 2:14 (cf. also Matt. 13:41), where "to put a stumbling block" recalls Lev. 19:14 and carries the sense of seduction into apostasy and immorality (cf. vv. 15, 20). (''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume'', 1038)&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Heinz Giesen, in the ''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament'', writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the passive voice σκανδαλίζω [''skandalizō''] more often means . . . "fall away from faith." In the interpretation of the parable of the sower (Mark 4:13-20 par. Matt 13:18-23) those identified with the seeds sown on rocky ground, i.e., those "with no root in themselves," the inconstant
ones, go astray to their own ruin when persecuted on account of the word, i.e., they fall away from faith (Mark 4:17 par. Matt 13:21). The Lukan parallel reads appropriately ἀφίστημι [''aphistēmi'', fall away] (8:13). In Matt 24:10 Jesus predicts that in the end time many will fall away [''skandalizō'']. The result is that they will hate one another, wickedness will be multiplied, and love will grow cold. Yet whoever endures in love until the end will be saved (vv. 11, 13).
. . . In the Johannine farewell address (John 16:1) σκανδαλίζω [''skandalizō''] does not only imply an "endangering of faith" . . . but rather "falling away from faith" entirely, from which the disciples and Christians are to be kept. . . . In the active voice σκανδαλίζω [''skandalizō''] means "cause someone to fall away from (or reject) faith," as in the saying of Jesus about the person who "''causes'' one of these little ones who believe in me ''to sin [stumble]''" (Mark 9:42 par. Matt 18:6/Luke 17:2). The Christian is enjoined to reject anything that might be an obstacle to faith, as emphasized in Mark 9:43,45,47 in metaphorical, hyperbolic language: Hand, foot, and eye--in Jewish understanding the loci of lust or sinful desires--must be given up if they threaten to become the cause of loss of faith and thus of salvation. This . . . underscores the seriousness of conviction within which one must persevere if one wishes to enter (eternal) life or the kingdom of God. . . . Matt 5:29, 30 also issues an exhortation to decisive action [cf. Matt 18:8, 9]. . . . According to 1 Cor 8:9 a Christian's freedom regarding eating food offered to idols reaches its limit when it becomes a stumbling block to one's brother (πρόσκομμα [''proskomma'']). Hence Paul emphasizes that he will never again eat meat if by doing so he causes his brother to fall and thus to lose salvation (σκανδαλίζω [''skandalizō''], v. 13a, b), since otherwise that weaker brother is destroyed by the knowledge of the "stronger" (v. 11). Whoever sins against his brothers sins also against Christ (v. 12). . . . Within the context of the protection of the "little ones" in the Church, i.e., probably the "weak ones" ([Matthew] 18:6-10), Jesus utters an eschatological threat ("woe!") against the world (alienated from God) because of ''temptations to sin'' (v. 7a); though he allows that such ''temptations'' must come (v. 7b), he finally hurls an eschatological "woe!" against the person by whom the ''temptation'' comes (v. 7c). σκάνδαλον [''skandalon''] used here of the temptation to fall away from faith. The parallel, Luke 17:1, like Matt 18:7b, also underscores that such temptations are unavoidable; nonetheless, the person by whom they come receives the eschatological "woe!" that already places him under divine judgment. . . . In Rom 14:13 Paul admonishes the "strong," whose position he fundamentally shares (v. 14), not to cause the "weak" any ''stumbling block to faith'' through eating habits . . . . In Rom 16:17 the σκάνδαλον [''skandalon''] are the various satanic activities of the false teachers who endanger the salvation of Church members, who are being seduced into falling away from correct teaching; such teachers also threaten both the unity and very existence of the Church. Similarly, in Rev 2:14 σκάνδαλον [''skandalon''] refers to a ''stumbling block'' to faith in the context of false teaching. According to 1 John 2:10 there is no cause for stumbling or sin in a believer who loves his brother . . . i.e., no cause for unbelief and thus a loss of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Giesen, ''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament'', 3:248-250.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul Barnett notes that James warns his readers of the possibility of temptation leading to apostasy. While a person is not tempted by God to sin, they can be "lured and enticed by his own desires" to sin (James 1:13–15).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;''Dictionary of the Later New Testament'', 74.&lt;/ref&gt; He adds, "This letter has in mind a 'way' (''hodos'', James 5:20) of belief and behavior, from which one may be "led astray" (''planasthe'', James 1:16; i.e., by the influence of others) or 'stray from' (''planēthē'', James 5:19; i.e., by one's own decision). Either way the one who is away from the true path is in jeopardy in regard to his or her personal salvation (James 5:20).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Barnett also mentions that "2 Peter addresses the grim situation of apostasy expressed by immorality (2 Peter 2:2–3, 14-16), under the influence of false teachers who have 'denied the master who bought them' (2 Peter 2:1, 17-22)."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Furthermore, in the book of Revelation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is clear that the churches of Asia are subject to persecution and its accompanying pressure to apostatize that arise from a Jewish quarter in Smyrna and Philadelphia (Revelation 2:9) and from the emperor cult in Pergamum (Revelation 2:13). At the same time various false teachings are touching the churches of Ephesus (Revelation 2:6), Pergamum (Revelation 2:14–15) and Thyatira (Revelation 2:20). The language of "deception," that is, of being "led astray," is applied to the false prophetess, Jezebel (Revelation 2:20). Satan, the source of all these persecution and false teachings, is also "the deceiver of the whole world" (Revelation 12:9). The metaphor, "deception" (''planaō''), implies a path of truth from which one might be "turned aside." Against these Satan-inspired obstacles the reader are called upon to "conquer," that is, to overcome these problems.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, ''Dictionary of the Later New Testament'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Apostasy in the Letter to the Hebrews===

The [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] is the classic text on the subject of apostasy in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, ''Dictionary of the Later New Testament'', 73.&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament scholar Scot McKnight argues that the warning passages (2:1–4; 3:7–4:13; 5:11–6:12; 10:19–39; 12:1–29) should be read and interpreted "as an organic whole, each of which expresses four components of the author’s message."&lt;ref&gt;"The Warning Passages of Hebrews: A Formal Analysis and Theological  Conclusions," ''[[Trinity Journal (theology)|Trinity Journal]]'' 13.1 (1992): 23.&lt;/ref&gt; These four components are "(1) the subjects or audience in danger of committing the sin, (2) the sin that leads to (3) the exhortation, which if not followed, leads to (4) the consequences of that sin."&lt;ref&gt;"The Warning Passages of Hebrews," 25&lt;/ref&gt; McKnight concluded from his study that (1) the subjects of this letter were genuine "believers, persons who . . . had converted to Jesus Christ,” (2) The sin "is apostasy, a deliberate and public act of deconfessing Jesus Christ, a rejection of God's Spirit, and a refusal to submit to God and His will," (3) the exhortation is "to a persevering faithfulness to God and his revelation of the [[new covenant]] in Jesus Christ," (4) the consequences involve "eternal [[damnation]] if a person does not persevere in the faith."&lt;ref&gt;"The Warning Passages of Hebrews," 54&lt;/ref&gt; B. J. Oropeza concludes that apostasy threatens the community in Hebrews on two fronts: mistreatment by outsiders (persecution) and malaise involving reluctance to listen to godly exhortation.&lt;ref&gt; B. J. Oropeza, ''Churches under Siege of Persecution and Assimilation: The General Epistles and Revelation''; Apostasy in the New Testament Communities, volume 3 (Eugene: Cascade, 2012), 67-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagery of Apostasy in the Bible===

''The Dictionary of Biblical Imagery'' states that "There are at least four distinct images in Scripture of the concept of apostasy. All connote an intentional defection from the faith."&lt;ref&gt;''The Dictionary of Biblical Imagery'', "Apostasy," 39.&lt;/ref&gt; These images are: Rebellion; Turning Away; Falling Away; Adultery.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;''Dictionary of Biblical Imagery'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rebellion====

"In classical literature ''apostasia'' was used to denote a coup or defection. By extension, the [[Septuagint]] (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) always uses this word to portray a rebellion against God ({{bibleverse||Joshua|22:22|NKJV}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:19|NKJV}})."&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

====Turning away====

"Apostasy is also pictured as the heart turning away from God (Jeremiah 17:5–6) and righteousness (Ezekiel 3:20). In the OT it centers on Israel's breaking [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] relationship with God through disobedience to the law (Jeremiah 2:19), especially following other gods (Judges 2:19) and practicing their immorality (Daniel 9:9–11). . . . Following the Lord or journeying with him is one of the chief images of faithfulness in the Scriptures. . . . The . . . Hebrew root (''swr'') is used to picture those who have turned away and ceased to follow God ('I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me,' 1 Samuel 15:11). . . . The image of turning away from the Lord, who is the rightful leader, and following behind false gods is the dominant image for apostasy in the Old Testament."&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

====Falling away====

"The image of falling, with the sense of going to eternal destruction, is particularly evident in the New Testament. . . . In his [Christ’s] parable of the wise and foolish builder, in which the house built on sand falls with a crash in the midst of a storm (Matthew 7:24–27) . . . he painted a highly memorable image of the dangers of falling spiritually."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Biblical Imagery'', 39. Paul Barnett says, "Jesus foresaw the fact of apostasy and warned both those who would fall into sin as well as those who would cause others to fall (see, e.g., Mark 9:42–49)." (''Dictionary of the Later New Testament'', 73).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adultery====

One of the most common images for apostasy in the Old Testament is adultery.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Biblical Imagery'', 39&lt;/ref&gt; "Apostasy is symbolized as Israel the faithless spouse turning away from Yahweh her marriage partner to pursue the advances of other gods (Jeremiah 2:1–3; Ezekiel 16). . . . 'Your children have forsaken me and sworn by god that are not gods. I supplied all their needs, yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of prostitutes' (Jeremiah 5:7, NIV). Adultery is used most often to graphically name the horror of the betrayal and covenant breaking involved in idolatry. Like literal adultery it does include the idea of someone blinded by infatuation, in this case for an idol: 'How I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts . . . which have lusted after their idols' (Ezekiel 6:9)."&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

====Other images====

A variety of colorful images are used to describe Israel’s apostasy: "a rebellious ox, a prostitute, a wild vine, a stain that will not wash off, a camel in heat and a thief caught in thievery (Jeremiah 2:19-28)."&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;''Dictionary of Biblical Imagery'', 40&lt;/ref&gt; Images of peril attend apostasy, for to have forsaken God is to come under his judgment (Exodus 22:20; Deuteronomy 6:14–15; 17:2–7).&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; "The New Testament contains a host of images of apostasy, including a plant taking root among the rocks but withering under the hot sun of testing (Mark 4:5–6, 17 par.), or those who fall prey to the wiles of false teachers (Matthew 24:11), heretical beliefs (1 Timothy 4:1; 2 Timothy 4:3–4), worldliness and its defilement (2 Peter 2:20–22), and persecution (Matthew 24:9–10; Revelation 3:8). The Christian apostate is pictured as a branch that does not abide in the vine of Christ and thus withers and is cast into the fire (John 15:6). Animal behavior is evoked in a dog returning to its vomit or a clean pig returning to the mire (2 Peter 2:22)."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Biblical Imagery'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of the early church fathers==

Paul Barnett says, "Believers in the era following that of the apostles probably suffered a greater intensity to turn aside from Christ than did their predecessors. They ... were vulnerable to Jewish reprisals as well as action from the state. Details of the pressure applied to Christians to apostatize is given from both Christian and non-Christian sources ... It is understandable, therefore, that the postapostolic literature should contain many warnings not to apostatize."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the Later New Testament'', 75. ''So'' Oropeza, ''Paul and Apostasy'', 3-12. See also ''Dictionary of Early Christian Beliefs: A Reference Guide to More Than 700 Topics Discussed by the Early Church Fathers'', edited by David Bercot, under the topic of "Salvation," "Can those who are saved ever be lost?": 586-591.&lt;/ref&gt; The following warnings not to apostatize come from the translation provided by Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson in the ''Ante-Nicene Fathers''.&lt;ref&gt;Peabody: Hendrickson, 1994, obtained at http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temptations: avoid vices and practice virtues===

[[Clement of Rome]] (c. 96) writes to the [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthian]] congregation whose unity has been threatened because a "few rash and self-confident persons" have kindled shameful and detestable seditions towards the established leaders (presbyters) in the congregation (''1 Clement'' 1). This jealous rivalry and envy has caused righteousness and peace to depart from the community (''1 Clement'' 3). The writer laments: "Every one abandons the fear of God, and is become blind in His faith, neither walks in the ordinances of His appointment, nor acts a part becoming a Christian, but walks after his own wicked lusts, resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy, by which death itself entered into the world." (''1 Clement'' 3) Since history has demonstrated that many evils have flowed from envy and jealousy (''1 Clement'' 4-6), the Corinthians are exhorted to repent (''1 Clement'' 7-8), yield obedience to God's "glorious will," and to "forsake all fruitless labors and strife, and envy, which leads to death" (''1 Clement'' 9:1). Furthermore, they are to "be of humble mind, laying aside all haughtiness, and pride, and foolishness, and angry feelings" (''1 Clement'' 13), and "to obey God rather than to follow those who, through pride and sedition, have become the leaders of a detestable emulation [jealous rivalry]" (''1 Clement'' 14). He then warns, "For we shall incur no slight injury, but rather great danger, if we rashly yield ourselves to the inclinations of men who aim at exciting strife and tumults, so as to draw us away from what is good" (''1 Clement'' 14; cf. 47). Clement bids his readers to cleave "to those who cultivate peace with godliness" (''1 Clement'' 15), and to follow the humility and submission that Christ and other saints practiced (''1 Clement'' 16-19), which brings peace and harmony with others (''1 Clement'' 19-20). Clement then gives these exhortations and warnings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Take heed, beloved, lest His many kindnesses lead to the condemnation of us all. [For thus it must be] unless we walk worthy of Him, and with one mind do those things which are good and well-pleasing in His sight. (''1 Clement'' 21)
:Since then all things are seen and heard [by God], let us fear Him, and forsake those wicked works which proceed from evil desires; so that, through His mercy, we may be protected from the judgments to come. For whither can any of us flee from His mighty hand? Or what world will receive any of those who run away from Him? (''1 Clement'' 28)
:Let us therefore earnestly strive to be found in the number of those who wait for Him, in order that we may share in His promised gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Three sentences earlier these "gifts of God" (''1 Clement'' 35:1) are mentioned as: "Life in immortality, splendor in righteousness, truth in perfect confidence, faith in assurance, self-control in holiness!" (''1 Clement'' 35:2)&lt;/ref&gt; But how, beloved, shall this be done? If our understanding be fixed by faith towards God; if we earnestly seek the things which are pleasing and acceptable to Him; if we do the things which are in harmony with His blameless will; and if we follow the way of truth, casting away from us all unrighteousness and iniquity, along with all covetousness, strife, evil practices, deceit, whispering, and evil-speaking, all hatred of God, pride and haughtiness, vainglory and ambition. For they that do such things are hateful to God; and not only they that do them, but also those who take pleasure in those who do them. (''1 Clement'' 35)
:Why are there strifes, and tumults, and divisions, and schisms, and wars among you? Have we not [all] one God and one Christ? Is there not one Spirit of grace poured out upon us? And have we not one calling in Christ? Why do we divide and tear to pieces the members of Christ, and raise up strife against our own body, and have reached such a height of madness as to forget that "we are members one of another?" Remember the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, how He said, "Woe to that man [by whom offences come]! It were better for him that he had never been born, than that he should cast a stumbling-block before one of my elect. Yea, it were better for him that a millstone should be hung about [his neck], and he should be sunk in the depths of the sea, than that he should cast a stumbling-block before one of my little ones." Your schism has subverted [the faith of] many, has discouraged many, has given rise to doubt in many, and has caused grief to us all. And still your sedition continues. (''1 Clement'' 46)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those responsible for laying the foundation of this sedition are urged to submit to the presbyters, repent, and to lay aside their pride and arrogance. For it is better that they occupy a humble place in the flock of Christ, than being highly exalted and ultimately "cast out from the hope of His people" (''1 Clement'' 57).&lt;ref&gt;Clement places a lot of emphasis on works of righteousness—avoiding sin and pursuing holiness. However, one should keep in mind that he says: "And we, too, [like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob] . . . are not justified by ourselves, nor by our own wisdom, or understanding, or godliness, or works which we have wrought in holiness of heart; but by that faith through which, from the beginning, Almighty God has justified all men." (''1 Clement'' 32)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to Clement, [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (c. 107) warns believers about following a schismatic person:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Keep yourselves from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not tend, because they are not the planting of the Father. Not that I have found any division among you, but exceeding purity. For as many as are of God and of Jesus Christ are also with the bishop. And as many as shall, in the exercise of repentance, return into the unity of the Church, these, too, shall belong to God, that they may live according to Jesus Christ. Do not err, my brethren. If any man follows him that makes a schism in the Church, he shall not inherit the kingdom of God. (''Epistle of the Philadelphians'' 3) &lt;ref&gt;Ignatius later writes: "For where there is division and wrath, God does not dwell. To all them that repent, the Lord grants forgiveness, if they turn in penitence to the unity of God, and to communion with the bishop" (''Philadelphians'' 8:1).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author of the epistle of Barnabas (c. 100) both admonishes and warns his readers about coming dangers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Since, therefore, the days are evil, and Satan possesses the power of this world, we ought to give heed to ourselves, and diligently inquire into the ordinances of the Lord. Fear and patience, then, are helpers of our faith; and long-suffering and continence are things which fight on our side. . . . We ought therefore, brethren, carefully to inquire concerning our salvation, lest the wicked one, having made his entrance by deceit, should hurl us forth from our [true] life. (Barnabas 2:1–2, 10).&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Oropeza comments that this passage refers to "careless Christians" who forfeit their "salvific life" (''Paul and Apostasy'', 203)&lt;/ref&gt;
:Let us then utterly flee from all the works of iniquity, lest these should take hold of us; and let us hate the error of the present time, that we may set our love on the world to come: let us not give loose reins to our soul, that it should have power to run with sinners and the wicked, lest we become like them. (''Barnabas'' 4:1–2)&lt;ref&gt;For believers to become wicked sinners is, in the author's mind, to share in their same fate—"eternal death with punishments" (''Barnabas'' 20:1).&lt;/ref&gt;
:We take earnest heed in these last days; for the whole [past] time of your faith will profit you nothing, unless now in this wicked time we also withstand coming sources of danger, as becomes the sons of God. That the Black One may find no means of entrance, let us flee from every vanity, let us utterly hate the works of the way of wickedness. . . . (''Barnabas'' 4:9–10)
:Let us be spiritually-minded: let us be a perfect temple to God. As much as in us lies, let us meditate upon the fear of God, and let us keep His commandments, that we may rejoice in His ordinances. The Lord will judge the world without respect of persons. Each will receive as he has done: if he is righteous, his righteousness will precede him; if he is wicked, the reward of wickedness is before him. Take heed, lest resting at our ease, as those who are the called [of God], we should fall asleep in our sins, and the wicked prince, acquiring power over us, should thrust us away from the kingdom of the Lord. (''Barnabas'' 4:11–13)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the last chapters of the epistle of Barnabas (18-21), the author sets two ways before Christians which are described in the metaphors of light and darkness (referring to abstaining from or the practicing of vices).&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Oropeza, ''Paul and Apostasy'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who walk in the light "will be glorified in the kingdom of heaven" (''Barnabas'' 21:1), and will be "safe in the day of judgment" (''Barnabas'' 21:6).&lt;ref&gt;The following is a summary of the way of light: to love and glorify God; to not join yourself with those  who walk in the way of death; to not forsake the Lord’s commandments; to not exalt or take glory to yourself; to not take evil counsel against your neighbor; to not allow over-boldness to enter into your soul; to not commit fornication or adultery; to not be a corrupter of youth; to not allow any kind of impurity to come out of your mouth; to not be mindful of evil against your brother; to not be of a doubtful mind; to not take the name of the Lord in vain; to not slay the child by procuring abortion, nor destroying it after it is born; to not covet; to not make a schism; to hate what is unpleasing to God and all hypocrisy; to hate the wicked one; to be pure in your soul (as far as possible); to be meek and peaceable; to love your neighbor; and to confess your sins. (''Barnabas'' 19:2–12)&lt;/ref&gt; While those who walk in darkness will experience "eternal death with punishment" (''Barnabas'' 20:1), and will be "destroyed with their works" (''Barnabas'' 21:1).&lt;ref&gt;The vices which lead to death and "destroy the soul" (''Barnabas'' 20:1) are the following: idolatry, over-confidence, the arrogance of power, hypocrisy, double-heartedness, adultery, murder, rapine [i.e., plundering], haughtiness, transgression, deceit, malice, self-sufficiency, poisoning, magic, avarice, want of the fear of God. [In this way, too,] are those who persecute the good, those who hate truth, those who love falsehood, those who know not the reward of righteousness, those who cleave not to that which is good, those who attend not with just judgment to the widow and orphan, those who watch not to the fear of God, [but incline] to wickedness, from whom meekness and patience are far off; persons who love vanity, follow after a reward, pity not the needy, labor not in aid of him who is overcome with toil; who are prone to evil-speaking, who know not Him that made them, who are murderers of children, destroyers of the workmanship of God; who turn away him that is in want, who oppress the afflicted, who are advocates of the rich, who are unjust judges of the poor, and who are in every respect transgressors. (''Barnabas'' 20:1–2)&lt;/ref&gt;
"The [[Didache]] (c. 100) also maintains two ways: the way of life or death. The way of life is associated with loving God and one's neighbor. It involves abstaining from vices mentioned in the Ten Commandments or related to bodily lusts, sorcery, and idolatry (including meat sacrificed to idols).&lt;ref&gt;Other vices to be abstained from are: murder, adultery, pederasty, fornication, stealing, practicing magic or witchcraft, killing a child by abortion; coveting; bearing false witness; speaking evil; lying; filthy talking; hypocrisy; hating others, money-loving, lustful, being hot-tempered, jealous, or quarrelsome. (''Didache'' 1–4)&lt;/ref&gt; The way of death includes the practices of these vices&lt;ref&gt;The vices that the author associates with the way of death are: murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rapines [i.e., plunderings], false witnessings, hypocrisies, double-heartedness, deceit, haughtiness, depravity, self-will, greediness, filthy talking, jealousy, over-confidence, loftiness, boastfulness; persecutors of the good, hating truth, loving a lie, not knowing a reward for righteousness, not cleaving to good nor to righteous judgment, watching not for that which is good, but for that which is evil; from whom meekness and endurance are far, loving vanities, pursuing requital, not pitying a poor man, not laboring for the afflicted, not knowing Him that made them, murderers of children, destroyers of the handiwork of God, turning away from him that is in want, afflicting him that is distressed, advocates of the rich, lawless judges of the poor, utter sinners. Be delivered, children, from all these. (''Didache'' 5)&lt;/ref&gt; (''Didache'' 1-6).”&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

In Polycarp's epistle to the Philippians (2nd century) the vice of covetousness is a significant danger.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Oropeza, ''Paul and Apostasy'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Presbyters are advised to be "keeping far off from all covetousness" (''Philippians'' 6). Polycarp expresses his grief over a former presbyter Valens and his wife who apparently committed some act of covetousness. He hopes that the Lord will grant them repentance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; He enjoins his readers to "abstain from covetousness," and "every form of evil," and goes on to give this warning, "If a man does not keep himself from covetousness, he shall be defiled by idolatry, and shall be judged as one of the heathen" (''Philippians'' 11). Polycarp says believers "ought to walk worthy of His commandments and glory," and that deacons are to be blameless, not slanderers or lovers of money, but temperate in all things, "walking according to the truth of the Lord" (''Philippians'' 5). He then adds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If we please Him in this present world, we shall receive also the future world, according as He has promised to us that He will raise us again from the dead, and that if we live worthily of Him, "we shall also reign together with Him," provided only we believe. In like manner, let the young men also be blameless in all things, being especially careful to preserve purity, and keeping themselves in, as with a bridle, from every kind of evil. For it is well that they should be cut off from the lusts that are in the world, since "every lust wars against the spirit;" [1 Peter 2:11] and "neither fornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, shall inherit the kingdom of God," [1 Corinthians 6:9–10] nor those who do things inconsistent and unbecoming. Wherefore, it is needful to abstain from all these things, being subject to the presbyters and deacons, as unto God and Christ. (''Philippians'' 5)&lt;ref&gt;Polycarp goes on to counsel presbyters to "be compassionate and merciful to all, bringing back those that wander," and to "be zealous in the pursuit of that which is good, keeping ourselves from causes of offense, from false brethren, and from those who in hypocrisy bear the name of the Lord, and draw away vain men into error" (''Philippians'' 6).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In an ancient sermon (c. 150) the author exhorts his audience to pursue righteousness and abstain from vices:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let us, then, not only call Him Lord, for that will not save us. For He saith, "Not everyone that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall be saved, but he that worketh righteousness." Wherefore, brethren, let us confess Him by our works, by loving one another, by not committing adultery, or speaking evil of one another, or cherishing envy; but by being continent, compassionate, and good. We ought also to sympathize with one another, and not be avaricious.&lt;ref&gt;To be avaricious is to have an insatiable greed for riches.&lt;/ref&gt; By such works let us confess Him, and not by those that are of an opposite kind. And it is not fitting that we should fear men, but rather God. For this reason, if we should do such [wicked] things, the Lord hath said, "Even though ye were gathered together to me in my very bosom, yet if ye were not to keep my commandments, I would cast you off, and say unto you, Depart from me; I know you not whence ye are, ye workers of iniquity." (''2 Clement'' 4)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The author further summons his readers to "do the will of Him that called us," (''2 Clement'' 5) and to consider
&lt;blockquote&gt;
that the sojourning in the flesh in this world is but brief and transient, but the promise of Christ is great and wonderful, even the rest of the kingdom to come, and of life everlasting. By what course of conduct, then, shall we attain these things, but by leading a holy and righteous life, and by deeming these worldly things as not belonging to us, and not fixing our desires upon them? For if we desire to possess them, we fall away from the path of righteousness. (''2 Clement'' 5)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The writer goes on to say that this present world (which urges one to "adultery and corruption, avarice and deceit"), is an enemy to the world to come (which "bids farewell to these things"), and thus, we cannot "be the friends of both" (''2 Clement'' 6). Therefore,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Let us reckon that it is better to hate the things present, since they are trifling, and transient, and corruptible; and to love those [which are to come,] as being good and incorruptible. For if we do the will of Christ, we shall find rest; otherwise, nothing shall deliver us from eternal punishment, if we disobey His commandments. . . . How can we hope to enter into the royal residence of God unless we keep our baptism holy and undefiled? Or who shall be our advocate, unless we be found possessed of works of holiness and righteousness? (''2 Clement'' 6)
:Let us also, while we are in this world, repent with our whole heart of the evil deeds we have done in the flesh, that we may be saved by the Lord, while we have yet an opportunity of repentance. For after we have gone out of the world, no further power of confessing or repenting will there belong to us. Wherefore, brethren, by doing the will of the Father, and keeping the flesh holy, and observing the commandments of the Lord, we shall obtain eternal life. (''2 Clement'' 8)&lt;ref&gt;Later Clement writes: I think not that I counted trivial counsel concerning continence [i.e., self-restraint]; following it, a man will not repent thereof, but will save both himself and me who counseled. For it is no small reward to turn back a wandering and perishing soul for its salvation. [James 5:19–20] . . . Let us, therefore, continue in that course in which we, righteous and holy, believed. . . . So, then, brethren, having received no small occasion to repent, while we have opportunity, let us turn to God who called us, while yet we have One to receive us. For if we renounce these indulgences and conquer the soul by not fulfilling its wicked desires, we shall be partakers of the mercy of Jesus. . . . Let us, then, repent with our whole heart, that no one of us may perish amiss. For if we have commands and engage in withdrawing from idols and instructing others, how much more ought a soul already knowing God not to perish. Rendering, therefore, mutual help, let us raise the weak also in that which is good, that all of us may be saved. . . . Let us remember the commandments of the Lord, and not be allured back by worldly lusts, but let us . . . draw near and try to make progress in the Lord's commands, that we all having the same mind may be gathered together for life. (''2 Clement'' 15–17)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
B. J. Oropeza writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:If the warning against vices and the call to repentance marks a facet of apostasy in patristic writings of the late first and early second centuries, the Shepherd of Hermas epitomizes this aspect. Those who have sinned grievously and committed apostasy are beckoned to return. Falling away and repentance are portrayed in complex ways, and this perhaps compliments the multifaceted nature of earliest Christian discourses on the issue. Contrary to the book of Hebrews, which seems to teach that baptized Christians are not given a second chance once they fall away (cf. Hebrews 6:4–6; 10:26–31), the Shepherd of Hermas affirms that apostates may be forgiven while a gap of time remains before the final eschaton. A refusal to respond to this offer will result in final condemnation. Those who have denied the Lord in the past are given a second chance, but those who deny him in the coming tribulation will be rejected "from their life" (''Her. Vis.'' 2.2).
:In the vision of the tower under construction (the church), numerous stones (believers) are gathered for the building. Among the rejected are those who are not genuine Christians; they received their faith in hypocrisy. Others do not remain in the truth, and others who go astray are finally burned in fire (''Vis.'' 3.6–7). Some others are novices who turn away before they are baptized, and still others fall away due to hardships, being led astray by their riches. They may become useful stones, however, if they are separated from their riches. The penitents receive 12 commands; salvific life depends on their observance (''Her. Man.'' 12.3–6). Repentance would become unprofitable for the Christian who falls again after restoration (''Man.'' 4.1:8; 3:6).
:In the Parables, rods of various shapes and sizes represent different kinds of believers: the faithful, rich, double-minded, doubtful-minded, and hypocritical deceivers. These are allowed to repent – if they do not, they will lose eternal life (''Her. Sim.'' 8.6–11). Apostates and traitors who blaspheme the Lord by their sins are completely destroyed (''Sim.'' 8.6:4). Another parable describes apostates as certain stones which are cast away from the house of God and delivered to women who represent 12 vices. They may enter the house again if they follow virgins who represent 12 virtues. Certain apostates became worse than they were before they believed and will suffer eternal death even though they had fully known God. Nevertheless, most people, whether apostates or fallen ministers, have an opportunity to repent and be restored (''Sim.'' 9.13–15, 18ff). Hermas and his audience are to persevere and practice repentance if they wish to partake of life (''Sim.'' 10.2–4).&lt;ref&gt;''Paul and Apostasy'', 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 180) recounts how God has recorded the sins of men of old (David and Solomon)
&lt;blockquote&gt;
for our instruction . . . that we might know, in the first place, that our God and theirs is one, and that sins do not please Him although committed by men of renown; and in the second place, that we should keep from wickedness. For if these men of old time, who preceded us in the gifts [bestowed upon them], and for whom the Son of God had not yet suffered, when they committed any sin and served fleshly lusts, were rendered objects of such disgrace, what shall the men of the present day suffer, who have despised the Lord’s coming, and become the slaves of their own lusts? And truly the death of the Lord became [the means of] healing and remission of sins to the former, but Christ shall not die again in behalf of those who now commit sin, for death shall no more have dominion over Him. . . . We ought not, therefore, as that presbyter remarks, to be puffed up, nor be severe upon those of old time, but ought ourselves to fear, lest perchance, after [we have come to] the knowledge of Christ, if we do things displeasing to God, we obtain no further forgiveness of sins, but be shut out from His kingdom. And therefore it was that Paul said, "For if [God] spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest He also spare not thee" [Romans 11:21]. . . . (''Against Heresies'', Book 4:27.2)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Irenaeus proceeds to quote from 1 Corinthians 10:1–12,&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus wrote: Thou wilt notice, too, that the transgressions of the common people have been described in like manner, not for the sake of those who did then transgress, but as a means of instruction unto us, and that we should understand that it is one and the same God against whom these men sinned, and against whom certain persons do now transgress from among those who profess to have believed in Him. But this also, [as the presbyter states,] has Paul declared most plainly in the Epistle to the Corinthians, when he says, "Brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and were all baptized unto Moses in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them; and the rock was Christ. But with many of them God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness. These things were for our example (in figuram nostri), to the intent that we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted; neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them also did, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. But all these things happened to them in a figure, and were written for our admonition, upon whom the end of the world (saeculorum) is come. Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall." (''Against Heresies'', Book 4:27.3)&lt;/ref&gt; where Israel fell under the judgment of God for craving evil things, and then comments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As then the unrighteous, the idolaters, and fornicators perished, so also is it now: for both the Lord declares, that such persons are sent into eternal fire; and the apostle says, "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, not effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God." [1 Corinthians 6:9–10] And as it was not to those who are without that he said these things, but to us—lest we should be cast forth from the kingdom of God, by doing any such thing. . . . And again does the apostle say, "Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of mistrust. Be not ye therefore partakers with them." [Ephesians 5:6–7] (''Against Heresies'', Book 4:27.4)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Deceptions: watch out for false teachers and heresies===

The "early Christians frequently believed that apostasy came by way of deceivers at the instigation of the devil, and terrible consequences awaited such people."&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Oropeza, ''Paul and Apostasy'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of Ignatius have several warnings about being on guard against false teachers and the heresy they disseminate. In the letter to the Christians at Ephesus, Ignatius is happy to report that "all live according to the truth, and that no sect has any dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do you hearken to any one rather than to Jesus Christ speaking in truth" (''Epistle to the Ephesians'' 6). He mentions that there are false teachers who "are in the habit of carrying about the name [of Jesus Christ] in wicked guile, while yet they practice things unworthy of God, whom you must flee as you would wild beasts. For they are ravening dogs, who bite secretly, against whom you must be on your guard" (''Epistle to the Ephesians'' 7).&lt;ref&gt;In another letter Ignatius writes: "Wherefore, as children of light and truth, flee from division and wicked doctrines. . . . For there are many wolves . . . who, by means of a pernicious pleasure, carry captive those that are running towards God; but in your unity they shall have no place" (''Epistle to the Philadelphians'' 2).&lt;/ref&gt; The readers are further admonished to "Let not then any one deceive you" (''Epistle to the Ephesians'' 8), and commended because "you did not allow [false teachers] to sow among you, but stopped your ears, that you might not receive those things [i.e., false doctrines] which were sown by them" (''Epistle to the Ephesians'' 9). Ignatius then gives this solemn warning:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Do not err, my brethren. Those that corrupt families shall not inherit the kingdom of God. If, then, those who do this as respects the flesh have suffered death, how much more shall this be the case with any one who corrupts by wicked doctrine the faith of God, for which Jesus Christ was crucified! Such a one becoming defiled [in this way], shall go away into everlasting fire, and so shall every one that hearkens unto him. . . . Be not anointed with the bad odor of the doctrine of the prince of this world; let him not lead you away captive from the life which is set before you. And why are we not all prudent, since we have received the knowledge of God, which is Jesus Christ? Why do we foolishly perish, not recognizing the gift which the Lord has of a truth sent to us? (''Epistle to the Ephesians'' 16-17)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the letter to the Magnesians, Ignatius admonishes his readers, "Be not deceived with strange doctrines, nor with old fables, which are unprofitable" (''Epistle to Magnesians'' 8). Later he writes: "I desire to guard you beforehand, that you fall not upon the hooks of vain doctrine, but that you attain to full assurance in regard to the birth, and passion, and resurrection which took place in the time of the government of Pontius Pilate, being truly and certainly accomplished by Jesus Christ, who is our hope, from which may no one of you ever be turned aside" (''Epistle to Magnesians'' 11). In yet another letter, Ignatius entreats his readers to
&lt;blockquote&gt;
use Christian nourishment only, and abstain from herbage of a different kind; I mean heresy. For those [that are given to this] mix up Jesus Christ with their own poison, speaking things which are unworthy of credit, like those who administer a deadly drug in sweet wine, which he who is ignorant of does greedily take, with a fatal pleasure leading to his own death. Be on your guard, therefore, against such persons. (''Epistle to the Trallians'' 6-7)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Furthermore:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance with Jesus Christ, who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was truly born, and ate and drank. He was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate; He was truly crucified, and [truly] died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth. He was also truly raised from the dead, His Father quickening Him, even as after the same manner His Father will so raise up us who believe in Him by Christ Jesus, apart from whom we do not possess the true life. (''Epistle to the Trallians'' 9)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"The final section of the Didache echoes the Synoptic tradition (Matthew 24:4–13, 15, 21–26; Mark 13:5ff; Luke 21:8ff; cf. 2 Thessalonians 2:3ff; Revelation 13:13–14) when it warns against apostasy through the deception of false prophets in the last days:"&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Watch for your life's sake. Let not your lamps be quenched, nor your loins unloosed; but be ready, for you know not the hour in which our Lord comes. But often shall you come together, seeking the things which are befitting to your souls: for the whole time of your faith will not profit you, if you be not made perfect in the last time. For in the last days false prophets and corrupters shall be multiplied, and the sheep shall be turned into wolves, and love shall be turned into hate; for when lawlessness increases, they shall hate and persecute and betray one another, and then shall appear the world-deceiver as the Son of God, and shall do signs and wonders, and the earth shall be delivered into his hands, and he shall do iniquitous things which have never yet come to pass since the beginning. Then shall the creation of men come into the fire of trial, and many shall be made to stumble and shall perish; but they that endure in their faith shall be saved from under the curse itself. (''Didache'' 16)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Tertullian argues that believers ought not to be surprised or alarmed at the existence of heresies since Christ and his apostles&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian mentions that it is the same apostle Paul, who in his letter to the Galatians: counts "heresies" among "the sins of the flesh," [Galatians 5:20] who also intimates to Titus, that "a man who is a heretic" must be "rejected after the first admonition," on the ground that "he that is such is perverted, and commits sin, as a self-condemned man." [Titus 3:10–11] Indeed, in almost every epistle, when enjoining on us (the duty) of avoiding false doctrines, he sharply condemns heresies. Of these the practical effects are false doctrines, called in Greek heresies, a word used in the sense of that choice which a man makes when he either teaches them (to others) or takes up with them (for himself). For this reason it is that he calls the heretic self-condemned, because he has himself chosen that for which he is condemned. We, however, are not permitted to cherish any object after our own will, nor yet to make choice of that which another has introduced of his private fancy. In the Lord's apostles we possess our authority; for even they did not of themselves choose to introduce anything, but faithfully delivered to the nations (of mankind) the doctrine which they had received from Christ. If, therefore, even "an angel from heaven should preach any other gospel" (than theirs), he would be called accursed by us. (''Prescription Against Heretics'' 6)&lt;/ref&gt; told us beforehand that they would arise and gave, "in anticipation, warnings to avoid them" (''Prescription Against Heretics'' 4, cf. 1).&lt;ref&gt;Therefore, heresies "must be shunned" (''Prescription Against Heretics'' 4).&lt;/ref&gt; Neither should believers be surprised that heresies "subvert the faith of some" (''Prescription Against Heretics'' 1). Heresies are a trial to faith, giving faith the opportunity to be approved (''Prescriptions Against Heretics'' 1). While heresies "are produced for the weakening and the extinction of faith," they have "no strength whenever they encounter a really powerful faith" (''Prescriptions Against Heretics'' 2). According to Tertullian, heresy is whatever contradicts the "rule of faith" which he defends as
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the belief that there is one only God, and that He is none other than the Creator of the world, who produced all things out of nothing through His own Word, first of all sent forth; that this Word is called His Son, and, under the name of God, was seen in diverse manners by the patriarchs, heard at all times in the prophets, at last brought down by the Spirit and Power of the Father into the Virgin Mary, was made flesh in her womb, and, being born of her, went forth as Jesus Christ; thenceforth He preached the new law and the new promise of the kingdom of heaven, worked miracles; having been crucified, He rose again the third day; (then) having ascended into the heavens, He sat at the right hand of the Father; sent instead of Himself the Power of the Holy Ghost to lead such as believe; will come with glory to take the saints to the enjoyment of everlasting life and of the heavenly promises, and to condemn the wicked to everlasting fire, after the resurrection of both these classes shall have happened, together with the restoration of their flesh. This rule, as it will be proved, was taught by Christ, and raises among ourselves no other questions than those which heresies introduce, and which make men heretics. (''Prescription Against Heretics'' 13)&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian believes that all heresies "have been introduced by the devil" (''Prescription Against Heretics'' 40).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Tertullian sees heretics as ravenous wolves "lurking within to waste the flock of Christ" (''Prescription Against Heretics'' 4). They pervert the Scriptures by interpreting them to suit their own purposes (''Prescription Against Heretics'' 17, cf. 4, 38).&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian notes that heretics frequently hang out with loose company, and that ungodliness is the natural effect of their teaching, since "they say that God is not to be feared; therefore all things are in their view free and unchecked" (''Prescription against Heretics'' 43).&lt;/ref&gt; Their teaching opposes the teaching "handed down from the apostles, the apostles from Christ, and Christ from God" (''Prescription Against Heretics'' 37). While persecution makes martyrs, "heresy only apostates" (''Prescription Against Heretics'' 4). In the face of heresies, which may cause a bishop or deacon to "have fallen from the rule (of faith)," the Christian must remain true to the faith, for "no one is a Christian but he who perseveres even to the end" (''Prescription Against Heretics'' 3).

Christian apologist Justin Martyr engages in a dialogue with Trypho (c. 160), who says, "I believe, however, that many of those who say that they confess Jesus, and are called Christians, eat meats offered to idols, and declare that they are by no means injured in consequence" (''Dialogue with Trypho'' 35). Justin's response highlights the importance of remaining faithful to "the true and pure doctrine of Jesus Christ" in the face of false teachers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fact that there are such men confessing themselves to be Christians, and admitting the crucified Jesus to be both Lord and Christ, yet not teaching His doctrines, but those of the spirits of error, causes us who are disciples of the true and pure doctrine of Jesus Christ, to be more faithful and steadfast in the hope announced by Him. For what things He predicted would take place in His name, these we do see being actually accomplished in our sight. For he said, "Many shall come in My name, clothed outwardly in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves." And, "There shall be schisms and heresies." [1 Corinthians 11:19] And, "Beware of false prophets, who shall come to you clothed outwardly in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves." And, "Many false Christ's and false apostles shall arise, and shall deceive many of the faithful." There are, therefore, and there were many, my friends, who, coming forward in the name of Jesus, taught both to speak and act impious and blasphemous things; and these are called by us after the name of the men from whom each doctrine and opinion had its origin. (For some in one way, others in another, teach to blaspheme the Maker of all things, and Christ . . . Yet they style themselves Christians. . . .) Some are called Marcians, and some Valentinians, and some Basilidians, and some Saturnilians, and others by other names; each called after the originator of the individual opinion. . . . So that, in consequence of these events, we know that Jesus foreknew what would happen after Him, as well as in consequence of many other events which He foretold would befall those who believed on and confessed Him, the Christ. For all that we suffer, even when killed by friends, He foretold would take place; so that it is manifest no word or act of His can be found fault with. Wherefore we pray for you and for all other men who hate us; in order that you, having repented along with us, may not blaspheme Him who, by His works, by the mighty deeds even now wrought through His name, by the words He taught, by the prophecies announced concerning Him, is the blameless, and in all things irreproachable, Christ Jesus; but, believing on Him, may be saved in His second glorious advent, and may not be condemned to fire by Him. (''Dialogue with Trypho'' 35)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Clement of Alexandria (c. 195) advises against giving into heretical men and their heresies in writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He who hopes for everlasting rest knows also that the entrance to it is toilsome "and strait." And let him who has once received the Gospel, even in the very hour in which he has come to the knowledge of salvation, "not turn back, like Lot's wife," as is said; and let him not go back either to his former life, which adheres to the things of sense, or to heresies. . . . He, who has spurned the ecclesiastical tradition, and darted off to the opinions of heretical men, has ceased to be a man of God and to remain faithful to the Lord. (''The Stromata'', Book 7:16)&lt;ref&gt;Only he who "believes the Scripture and voice of the Lord, which by the Lord acts to the benefiting of men, is rightly [regarded] faithful." (''The Stromata'', Book 7:16). Heretics are those who are "giving themselves up to pleasures, [and] wrest Scripture, in accordance with their lusts," and "wrest them to their own opinions" (''The Stromata'', Book 7:16). Furthermore, when they quote from the Scriptures they "alter the meanings . . . according to their true nature" (''The Stromata'', Book 7:16). Therefore, the author concludes that "we must never, as do those who follow the heresies, adulterate the truth, or steal the canon of the Church, by gratifying our own lusts and vanity, by defrauding our neighbors; whom above all it is our duty, in the exercise of love to them, to teach to adhere to the truth" (''The Stromata'', Book 7:16).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cyprian (c. 251) bids his readers to "use foresight and watching with an anxious heart, both to perceive and to beware of the wiles of the crafty foe, that we, who have put on Christ the wisdom of God the Father, may not seem to be wanting in wisdom in the matter of providing for our salvation" (''The Treatises of Cyprian'' 1:1). He cautions that "it is not persecution alone that is to be feared; nor those things which advance by open attack to overwhelm and cast down the servants of God," for we have an enemy who is to be more feared and guarded against because he secretly creeps in to deceive us under the appearance of peace (''The Treatises of Cyprian'' 1:1). By following the example of the Lord in recognizing and resisting the temptations of the devil, Christians will not be "incautiously turned back into the nets of death," but go on to "possess the immortality that we have received" (''The Treatises of Cyprian'' 1:2).&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian states that this immortality is not possessed "unless we keep those commands of Christ whereby death is driven out and overcome, when He Himself warns us, and says, 'If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments?' [Matthew 19:17] And again: 'If ye do the things that I command you, henceforth I call you not servants, but friends.' [John 16:15]" (''The Treatises of Cyprian'' 1:2)&lt;/ref&gt; Only by standing fast in learning and doing what Christ commanded does the Christian have security against the onslaughts of the world (''The Treatises of Cyprian'' 1:2). He who does not "must of necessity waver and wander, and, caught away by a spirit of error . . . be blown about; and he will make no advance in his walk towards salvation, because he does not keep the truth of the way of salvation." (''The Treatises of Cyprian'' 1:2)
Cyprian says the devil, when he see his idols forsaken and temples deserted by new believers, devises a fraud under "the Christian name to deceive the incautious" (''The Treatises of Cyprian'' 1:3):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He has invented heresies and schisms, whereby he might subvert the faith, might corrupt the truth, might divide the unity. Those whom he cannot keep in the darkness of the old way, he circumvents and deceives by the error of a new way. He snatches men from the Church itself; and while they seem to themselves to have already approached to the light, and to have escaped the night of the world, he pours over them again, in their unconsciousness, new darkness; so that, although they do not stand firm with the Gospel of Christ, and with the observation and law of Christ, they still call themselves Christians, and, walking in darkness, they think that they have the light, while the adversary is flattering and deceiving, who, according to the apostle's word, transforms himself into an angel of light, and equips his ministers as if they were the ministers of righteousness, who maintain night instead of day, death for salvation, despair under the offer of hope, perfidy under the pretext of faith, antichrist under the name of Christ; so that, while they feign things like the truth, they make void the truth by their subtlety. This happens, beloved brethren, so long as we do not return to the source of truth, as we do not seek the head nor keep the teaching of the heavenly Master. (''The Treatises of Cyprian'' 1:3)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Oropeza states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In view of Eusebius (c. 260-340), Simon Magus was the author of heresy (cf. Acts 8:9–24), and the devil is to be blamed for bringing the Samaritan magician to Rome and empowering him with deceitful arts which led many astray (Eus. ''Hist. Eccl.'' 2.13). The magician was supposedly aided by demons and venerated as a god, and Helen, his companion, was thought to be his first emanation (Just. ''Apol.'' 1.26; ''Adv. Haer.'' 1.33; cf. ''Iren Haer.'' 1.23:1–4). Simon's successor, Menander of Samaria, was considered to be another instrument of the devil; he claimed to save humans from the aeons through magical arts. After baptism, his followers believed themselves to be immortal in the present life. It is stated that those who claim such people as their saviors have fallen away from the true hope (Eus. ''Hist. Eccl.'' 3.26). Basilides of Alexandria and Saturninus of Antioch followed Menander's ways. Adherents of the former declared that eating meat sacrificed to idols or renouncing the faith in times of persecution were matters of indifference. Carpocrates is labeled as the first of the Gnostics. His followers allegedly transmitted Simon’s magic in an open manner. Eusebius asserts that the devil’s intention was to entrap many believers and bring them to the abyss of destruction by following these deceivers (''Hist. Eccl.'' 4.7).&lt;ref&gt;''Paul and Apostasy'', 6–7. Oropeza adds: The use of anathemas and excommunications became the normative means of handling heresy. Hippolytus (c. 170–236) affirmed that there was no place for the heretic in the church; expulsion from the earthly Eden was their lot. Cyprian (c. 258) viewed the heretics as those who lose their salvation because they put themselves outside the unity of the church. Cyril of Alexandria (c. 444) anathematized Nestorianism, and creeds (such as the Athanasian) declared anathemas on those who did not hold to the tenets of the creed. The condemnation of heretics gave way to abuse as church and state distinctions were blurred after the time of Constantine. (''Paul and Apostasy'', 7)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Persecutions: perseverance and martyrdom===
Oropeza writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:The Martyrdom of Polycarp is sometimes considered to be the first of the "Acts of the Martyrs." In this document Polycarp is killed for refusing to confess Caesar as Lord and offer incense; he refuses to revile Christ (''Mar. Pol.'' 8ff; similarly, ''Ign. Rom.'' 7). Other Christians did not always follow his example. Some fell into idolatry in the face of persecutions.
:Stirred by his own experience under the Diocletian (c. 284-305) persecution, Eusebius wrote Collection of Martyrs and emphasized persecution and martyrdom in his History of the Church. He describes Christians who persevered and others who fell away. Polycarp and Germanicus were found to be faithful in the persecution at Smyrna (c. 160), but Quintus threw away his salvation in the sight of the wild beasts (Eus. ''Hist. Eccl.'' 4.15). During Marcus Aurelius' reign (c. 161-80), Eusebius affirms that the Christians confessed their faith despite their suffering from abuse, plundering, stoning, and imprisonment. It is recorded that in Gaul some became martyrs, but others who were untrained and unprepared (about 10 in number) proved to be "abortions" (εξετρωσαν), discouraging the zeal of others. A woman named Biblias, who had earlier denied Christ, confessed him and was joined with the martyrs. Certain defectors did likewise, but others continued to blaspheme the Christian faith, having no understanding of the "wedding garment" (i.e., Matthew 22:11ff) and no faith (''Hist. Eccl.'' 5.1).
:During the reign of Decius (c. 249-51), the Christians of Alexandria are said to have endured martyrdom, stoning, or having their belongings confiscated for not worshipping at an idol's temple or chanting incantations. But some readily made unholy sacrifices, pretending that they had never been Christians, while others renounced their faith or were tortured until they did (''Hist. Eccl.'' 6.41). In his account of the Diocletian persecution, Eusebius commends the heroic martyrs but is determined to mention nothing about those who made shipwreck of their salvation, believing that such reports would not edify his readers (8.2:3). He recollects Christians who suffered in horrible ways which included their being axed to death or slowly burned, having their eyes gouged out, their limbs severed, or their backs seared with melted lead. Some endured the pain of having reeds driven under their fingernails or unmentionable suffering in their private parts (8.12).&lt;ref&gt;''Paul and Apostasy'', 8. Terrullian (c. 213) asks, "Does God covet man's blood [i.e., via martyrdom]? And yet I might venture to affirm that He does, if man also covets the kingdom of heaven, if man covets a sure salvation. . . .” (''Scorpiace'' 6).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Clement seeks to inspire perseverance in the midst of suffering with these words: "Let us, therefore, work righteousness, that we may be saved to the end. Blessed are they who obey these commandments, even if for a brief space they suffer in this world, and they will gather the imperishable fruit of the resurrection. Let not the godly man, therefore, grieve; if for the present he suffer affliction, blessed is the time that awaits him there; rising up to life again with the fathers he will rejoice for ever without a grief" (''2 Clement'' 19).

Cyprian (c. 250), commands the presbyters and deacons to take care of the poor and "especially those who have stood with unshaken faith and have not forsaken Christ's flock" while in prison (''The Epistles of Cyprian'' 5:2). These "glorious confessors" need to be instructed that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
they ought to be humble and modest and peaceable, that they should maintain the honor of their name, so that those who have achieved glory by what they have testified, may achieve glory also by their characters. . . . For there remains more than what is yet seen to be accomplished, since it is written "Praise not any man before his death;" and again, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." [Revelation 2:10] And the Lord also says, "He that endures to the end, the same shall be saved." [Matthew 10:22]. Let them imitate the Lord, who at the very time of His passion was not more proud, but more humble. (''The Epistles of Cyprian'' 5:2)&lt;ref&gt;In another letter, Cyprian rejoices over the presbyter and other confessors of Christ "whom the devil has not been able to overcome," but shares how he is grieved "over those whom a hostile persecution has cast down" (''The Epistles of Cyprian'' 6:1).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ignatius's letter to the Christians in Rome gives valuable insight into the heart of a Christian who is prepared for martyrdom. Ignatius hopes to see them when he arrives as a prisoner. He fears that the love they have for him will, in some way, save him from certain death (''Epistle to the Romans'' 1-2). Yet, he desires to "obtain grace to cling to my lot without hindrance unto the end" so that he may "attain to God" (''Epistle to the Romans'' 1). He requests prayer for "both inward and outward strength" that he might not "merely be called a Christian, but really found to be one,"--a Christian "deemed faithful" (''Epistle to the Romans'' 3). He says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I write to the Churches, and impress on them all, that I shall willingly die for God, unless you hinder me. . . . Allow me to become food for the wild beasts, through whose instrumentality it will be granted me to attain to God. I am the wheat of God, and let me be ground by the teeth of the wild beasts, that I may be found the pure bread of Christ. Rather entice the wild beasts, that they may become my tomb, and may leave nothing of my body. . . . Then shall I truly be a disciple of Christ, when the world shall not see so much as my body. Entreat Christ for me, that by these instruments I may be found a sacrifice [to God]. . . . But when I suffer, I shall be the freed-man of Jesus, and shall rise again emancipated in Him. And now, being a prisoner, I learn not to desire anything worldly or vain. . . . And let no one, of things visible or invisible, envy me that I should attain to Jesus Christ. Let fire and the cross; let the crowds of wild beasts; let tearings, breakings, and dislocations of bones; let cutting off of members; let shatterings of the whole body; and let all the dreadful torments of the devil come upon me: only let me attain to Jesus Christ. All the pleasures of the world, and all the kingdoms of this earth, shall profit me nothing. It is better for me to die in behalf of Jesus Christ, than to reign over all the ends of the earth. "For what shall a man be profited, if he gain the whole world, but lose his own soul?" Him I seek, who died for us: Him I desire, who rose again for our sake. This is the gain which is laid up for me. . . . Permit me to be an imitator of the passion of my God. (''Epistle to the Romans'' 4-6)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Tertullian believes that martyrdom is necessary at times in order for soldiers in God's army to obey the command to not worship idols.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If, therefore, it is evident that from the beginning this kind of worship [of idols] has both been forbidden—witness the commands so numerous and weighty—and that it has never been engaged in without punishment following, as examples so numerous and impressive show, and that no offense is counted by God so presumptuous as a trespass of this sort, we ought further to perceive the purport of both the divine threatenings and their fulfillments, which was even then commended not only by the not calling in question, but also by the enduring of martyrdoms, for which certainly He had given occasion by forbidding idolatry. . . . The injunction is given me not to make mention of any other god, not even by speaking—as little by the tongue as by the hand—to fashion a god, and not to worship or in any way show reverence to another than Him only who thus commands me, whom I am both bid fear that I may not be forsaken by Him, and love with my whole being, that I may die for Him. Serving as a soldier under this oath, I am challenged by the enemy. If I surrender to them, I am as they are. In maintaining this oath, I fight furiously in battle, am wounded, hewn in pieces, slain. Who wished this fatal issue to his soldier, but he who sealed him by such an oath? (''Scorpiace'' 4)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the following chapter Tertullian maintains that "martyrdom is good," especially when the Christian faces the temptation to worship idols, which is forbidden. He goes on to write,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For martyrdom strives against and opposes idolatry. But to strive against and oppose evil cannot be ought but good. . . . For martyrdom contends with idolatry, not from some malice which they share, but from its own kindness; for it delivers from idolatry. Who will not proclaim that to be good which delivers from idolatry?  What else is the opposition between idolatry and martyrdom, than that between life and death? Life will be counted to be martyrdom as much as idolatry to be death. . . . Thus martyrdoms also rage furiously, but for salvation. God also will be at liberty to heal for everlasting life by means of fires and swords, and all that is painful. (''Scorpiace'' 5)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Tertullian has a long discussion on the certainty of persecutions and the reality of death for followers of Christ. Quoting extensively from the teachings of Jesus, Tertullian urges Christians towards faithful endurance in order to obtain final salvation with God.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When setting forth His chief commands, "Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." [Matthew 5:10] The following statement, indeed, applies first to all without restriction, then especially to the apostles themselves: "Blessed shall you be when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, since very great is your reward in heaven; for so used their fathers to do even to the prophets." [Matthew 5:11–12] So that He likewise foretold their having to be themselves also slain, after the example of the prophets. . . . The rule about enduring persecution also would have had respect to us too, as to disciples by inheritance, and, (as it were,) bushes from the apostolic seed. For even thus again does He address words of guidance to the apostles: "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves;" [Matthew 10:16] and, "Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; and you shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles," etc. [Matthew 10:17–18] Now when He adds, "But the brother will deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child; and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death," [Matthew 10:21] He has clearly announced with reference to the others, (that they would be subjected to) this form of unrighteous conduct, which we do not find exemplified in the case of the apostles. For none of them had experience of a father or a brother as a betrayer, which very many of us have. Then He returns to the apostles: "And you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake." How much more shall we, for whom there exists the necessity of being delivered up by parents too! Thus, by allotting this very betrayal, now to the apostles, now to all, He pours out the same destruction upon all the possessors of the name, on whom the name, along with the condition that it be an object of hatred, will rest. But he who will endure on to the end—this man will be saved. By enduring what but persecution—betrayal—death? For to endure to the end is naught else than to suffer the end. And therefore there immediately follows, "The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his own lord;" [Matthew 10:24] because, seeing the Master and Lord Himself was steadfast in suffering persecution, betrayal and death, much more will it be the duty of His servants and disciples to bear the same, that they may not seem as if superior to Him, or to have got an immunity from the assaults of unrighteousness, since this itself should be glory enough for them, to be conformed to the sufferings of their Lord and Master; and, preparing them for the endurance of these, He reminds them that they must not fear such persons as kill the body only, but are not able to destroy the soul, but that they must dedicate fear to Him rather who has such power that He can kill both body and soul, and destroy them in hell [Matthew 10:28]. Who, pray, are these slayers of the body only, but the governors and kings aforesaid—men, I suppose? Who is the ruler of the soul also, but God only? Who is this but the threatener of fires hereafter, He without whose will not even one of two sparrows falls to the ground; that is, not even one of the two substances of man, flesh or spirit, because the number of our hairs also has been recorded before Him? Fear not, therefore. When He adds, "You are of more value than many sparrows," He makes promise that we shall not in vain—that is, not without profit—fall to the ground if we choose to be killed by men rather than by God. "Whosoever therefore will confess in me before men, in him will I confess also before my Father who is in heaven; and whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I deny also before my Father who is in heaven." [Matthew 10:32–34] [What] if a Christian is to be stoned . . . burned . . . butchered . . . [or] put an end to by beasts . . . ? He who will endure these assaults to the end, the same shall be saved. . . . For what does He add after finishing with confession and denial? "Think not that I have come to send peace on earth, but a sword,"—undoubtedly on the earth. "For I have come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household." [Matthew 10:34–35] For so is it brought to pass, that the brother delivers up the brother to death, and the father the son: and the children rise up against the parents, and cause them to die. And he who endures to the end let that man be saved. [Matthew 10:22] So that this whole course of procedure characteristic of the Lord's sword, which has been sent not to heaven, but to earth, makes confession also to be there, which by enduring to the end is to issue in the suffering of death. In the same manner, therefore, we maintain that the other announcements too refer to the condition of martyrdom. "He," says Jesus, "who will value his own life also more than me, is not worthy of me," [Luke 14:26] —that is, he who will rather live by denying, than die by confessing, me; and "he who finds his life shall lose it; but he who loses it for my sake shall find it." [Matthew 10:39] Therefore indeed he finds it, who, in winning life, denies; but he who thinks that he wins it by denying, will lose it in hell. On the other hand, he who, through confessing, is killed, will lose it for the present, but is also about to find it unto everlasting life. Who, now, should know better the marrow of the Scriptures than the school of Christ itself?—the persons whom the Lord both chose for Himself as scholars, certainly to be fully instructed in all points, and appointed to us for masters to instruct us in all points. To whom would He have rather made known the veiled import of His own language, than to him to whom He disclosed the likeness of His own glory—to Peter, John, and James, and afterwards to Paul, to whom He granted participation in (the joys of) paradise too, prior to his martyrdom? Or do they also write differently from what they think—teachers using deceit, not truth? Addressing the Christians of Pontus, Peter, at all events, says, "How great indeed is the glory, if you suffer patiently, without being punished as evildoers! For this is a lovely feature, and even hereunto were you called, since Christ also suffered for us, leaving you Himself as an example, that you should follow His own steps." [1 Peter 2:20–21] And again: "Beloved, be not alarmed by the fiery trial which is taking place among you, as though some strange thing happened unto you. For, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, do you rejoice; that, when His glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy. If you are reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you; because glory and the Spirit of God rest upon you: if only none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil-doer, or as a busybody in other men's matters; yet (if any man suffer) as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf." [1 Peter 4:12–14] John, in fact, exhorts us to lay down our lives even for our brethren, [1 John 3:16] affirming that there is no fear in love: "For perfect love casts out fear, since fear has punishment; and he who fears is not perfect in love." [1 John 4:18] What fear would it be better to understand (as here meant), than that which gives rise to denial? What love does he assert to be perfect, but that which puts fear to flight, and gives courage to confess? What penalty will he appoint as the punishment of fear, but that which he who denies is about to pay, who has to be slain, body and soul, in hell? And if he teaches that we must die for the brethren, how much more for the Lord,—he being sufficiently prepared, by his own Revelation too, for giving such advice! For indeed the Spirit had sent the injunction to the angel of the church in Smyrna: "Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you a crown of life." [Revelation 2:10] Also to the angel of the church in Pergamus (mention was made) of Antipas, [Revelation 2:13] the very faithful martyr, who was slain where Satan dwells. Also to the angel of the church in Philadelphia [Revelation 3:10] (it was signified) that he who had not denied the name of the Lord was delivered from the last trial. Then to every conqueror the Spirit promises now the tree of life, and exemption from the second death; now the hidden manna with the stone of glistening whiteness, and the name unknown (to every man save him that receives it); now power to rule with a rod of iron, and the brightness of the morning star; now the being clothed in white raiment, and not having the name blotted out of the book of life, and being made in the temple of God a pillar with the inscription on it of the name of God and of the Lord, and of the heavenly Jerusalem; now a sitting with the Lord on His throne . . . . Who, pray, are these so blessed conquerors, but martyrs in the strict sense of the word? For indeed theirs are the victories whose also are the fights; theirs, however, are the fights whose also is the blood. But the souls of the martyrs both peacefully rest in the meantime under the altar, [Revelation 6:9] and support their patience by the assured hope of revenge; and, clothed in their robes, wear the dazzling halo of brightness, until others also may fully share in their glory. For yet again a countless throng are revealed, clothed in white and distinguished by palms of victory, celebrating their triumph doubtless over Antichrist, since one of the elders says, "These are they who come out of that great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." [Revelation 7:14] For the flesh is the clothing of the soul. The uncleanness, indeed, is washed away by baptism, but the stains are changed into dazzling whiteness by martyrdom. . . . When great Babylon likewise is represented as drunk with the blood of the saints, [Revelation 17:6] doubtless the supplies needful for her drunkenness are furnished by the cups of martyrdoms; and what suffering the fear of martyrdoms will entail, is in like manner shown. For among all the castaways, nay, taking precedence of them all, are the fearful. "But the fearful," says John—and then come the others—"will have their part in the lake of fire and brimstone." [Revelation 21:8] Thus fear, which, as stated in his epistle, love drives out, has punishment. (''Scorpiace'' 9–12)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Readings from the early church fathers such as these led patristic scholar David Bercot to conclude: "Since the early Christians believed that our continued faith and obedience are necessary for salvation, it naturally follows that they believed that a 'saved' person could still end up being lost [through apostasy]."&lt;ref&gt;''Will the Real Heretics Please Stand Up: A New Look at Today's Evangelical Church in the Light of Early Christianity'', 65. From his extensive research New Testament scholar B. J. Oropeza arrived at the same conclusion: "The church fathers would affirm the reality of the phenomenon of apostasy" (''Paul and Apostasy'', 13). For Opropeza's full discussion on "Apostasy and Perseverance in Church History," see pages 1–13. Traditional Calvinists Thomas R. Schreiner and Ardel B. Caneday, in their book ''The Race Set Before Us: A Biblical Theology of Perseverance and Assurance'' (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 2001), recommend that readers see Oropeza's "excellent history of interpretation on the matter of perseverance and apostasy" (10, footnote 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary theological perspectives==
{{see also|Calvinism|Arminianism|History of Calvinist–Arminian debate|Free will in theology}}
There appears to be three primary perspectives on apostasy in Protestantism: Classical or Reformed Calvinism, Moderate Calvinism, and Reformed Arminianism.&lt;ref&gt;See Oropeza, ''Paul and Apostasy'', 1-34. One can find each of these views being represented in the book ''Four Views on Eternal Security'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2002), which deals with the topic of apostasy. The fourth view in this book, "Wesleyan Arminianism," shares so much in common with "Reformed Arminianism" regarding apostasy that it does not seem to warrant a separate treatment. See also the ''Four Views on the Warning Passages in Hebrews'' (Grand Rapids: Kregel Publications, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical or reformed Calvinism===

According to John Calvin (1509–1564), once the Holy Spirit brings a person to regeneration (i.e., gives them spiritual life) this experience cannot be lost and leads to final salvation with God.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Jefferson Davis]], "The Perseverance of the Saints: A History of the Doctrine," 217. Davis goes on to write: "This view is apparent in Calvin's comment on 1 John 3:9 ('No one born of God commits sin, for God's nature abides in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God'). Calvin argues that the apostle John 'plainly declares that the Spirit continues his grace in us to the last, so that inflexible perseverance is added to newness of life.' Can the fear and love of God be extinguished in the truly regenerate? No, because 'the seed, communicated when God regenerates his elect, as it is incorruptible, retains its virtue perpetually.' The 'seed' is the presence of God's new life in the believer." ("The Perseverance of the Saints: A History of the Doctrine," 217)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Calvin's theology]], God has predestined to regenerate some (the elect) to eternal life and not to regenerate others (the non-elect) which ensures their eternal damnation (''Calvin's Institutes'' 3.21:5; cf. 3.2:15–40, 14.6–9, 18–20, 24.6f.).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Oropeza, ''Paul and Apostasy'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The elect may fall away from God's grace temporarily, but the truly elect will eventually be restored and not plunge into final apostasy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Calvin believed that "The Lord uses the fear of final apostasy in order to safeguard true believers against it. Only the ones who ignore the threat are in real danger of falling away."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Calvin viewed the passages on apostasy found in Hebrews (6:4–6; 10:26–29) as applying to those in the church having a false faith—reprobates (i.e., unbelievers) who have never experienced regeneration.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; John Jefferson Davis writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even though Calvin believes that regeneration is irreversible . . . he does not conclude that the Christian has any cause for spiritual complacency. Persevering in God's grace requires, on the human side, "severe and arduous effort." . . . The believer needs to continually feed his soul on the preaching of the Word and to grow in faith throughout the whole course of life. Since it is easy for the believer to fall away for a time from the grace of God, there is constant need for "striving and vigilance, if we would persevere in the grace of God." Calvin thus balances his theological certitudes with pastoral warnings. . . . The believer must continually exercise faith and obedience to make "his calling and election sure."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, "The Perseverance of the Saints: A History of the Doctrine," 222.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Others in the Reformed tradition followed Calvin's theology on election, regeneration, perseverance, and apostasy: Zacharias Ursinus (1534–1583);&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; William Perkins (1558–1602);&lt;ref&gt;Oropeza, ''Paul and Apostasy'', 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; John Owen (1616–1683);&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Oropeza, ''Paul and Apostasy'', 17.&lt;/ref&gt; John Gill (1697–1771);&lt;ref&gt;Oropeza, ''Paul and Apostasy'', 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758);&lt;ref&gt;Oropeza, ''Paul and Apostasy'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and George Whitefield (1714–1770).&lt;ref&gt;Oropeza, ''Paul and Apostasy'', 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Reformed confessions such as the ''Canons of the Synod of Dort'' (1619) and the Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) also express views parallel with Calvin's theology.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, "The Perseverance of the Saints: A History of the Doctrine," 222–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moderate Calvinism===

In his book, ''Reign of the Servant Kings: A Study of Eternal Security and the Final Significance of Man'', [[Free Grace theology|Free Grace]] author Joseph Dillow seeks to chart a middle position between the Reformed Calvinist and Arminian position on apostasy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;''Reign of the Servant Kings'', xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Dillow accepts "the Reformed position that those who are truly born again can never lose their salvation."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; But he also accepts the Arminian position that the warning passages concerning apostasy in the New Testament (e.g., Hebrews 6) are directed to genuine Christians, not merely professing Christians who are in reality unbelievers as reformed Calvinists assert.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; There are real dangers in these warning passages, but contrary to the Arminian view, it "is ''not [the] loss of salvation but severe divine discipline'' (physical death or worse) in the present time and loss of reward, and even rebuke, at the judgment seat of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;''Reign of the Servant Kings'', 22; cf. xvi, 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Dillow, like other [[Free Grace theology|Free Grace]] adherents, disagrees with reformed Calvinists and Arminians in holding that saving faith in Christ ''must'' continue in order for a person to obtain final salvation with God.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Geisler believes that "Continued belief is not a condition for keeping one's salvation." ("Moderate Calvinism," ''Four Views on Eternal Security'', 109). Zane Hodges says: ". . . We miss the point to insist that true saving faith must necessarily continue. Of course, our faith in Christ should continue. But the claim that it absolutely must . . . has no support at all in the Bible" (''Absolutely Free! A Biblical Reply to Lordship Salvation'', 63). Charles Stanley writes, "To say that our salvation can be taken from us for any reason, whether it be sin or disbelief, is to ignore the plain meaning of this text [Ephesians 2:8–9]" (''Eternal Security'', 81). Dillow believes: "it is possible for true Christians to fail to persevere in faith and, in remote cases, even to deny the faith altogether (Hebrews 10:26, 35)" (''Reign of the Servant Kings'', 21). What a Christian "forfeits when he 'falls away' [into unbelief and apostasy] is not his eternal destiny but his opportunity to reign with Christ's metochoi [companions] in the coming kingdom" (''The Reign of the Servant Kings'', 202). Dillow comments, "Even though [Arminian] Robert Shank would not agree, it is definitely true that saving faith is 'the act of a single moment whereby all the benefits of Christ's life, death, and resurrection suddenly become the irrevocable possession of the individual, per se, despite any and all eventualities'" (''The Reign of the Servant Kings'', 202). For Dillow, any and all eventualities would include falling away from the Christian faith and to "cease believing." (''The Reign of the Servant Kings'', 199).&lt;/ref&gt; The prominent authors for the Moderate Calvinist perspective are: R. T. Kendall;&lt;ref&gt;''Once Saved, Always Saved'' (1983, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Zane C. Hodges;&lt;ref&gt;''Absolutely Free! A Biblical Reply to Lordship Salvation'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Charles C.

===Reformed Arminianism===

Reformed Arminianism derives its name from pastor and theologian James Arminius (1560–1609). Right up until his death, Arminius was undecided as to whether a believer could commit apostasy.&lt;ref&gt;Arminius wrote: "My sentiments respecting the perseverance of the Saints are, that those persons who have been grafted into Christ by true faith, and have thus been made partakers of his life-giving Spirit, possess sufficient powers [or strength] to fight against Satan, sin, the world and their own flesh, and to gain the victory over these enemies – yet not without the assistance of the grace of the same Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ also by his Spirit assists them in all their temptations, and affords them the ready aid of his hand; and, provided they stand prepared for the battle, implore his help, and be not wanting to themselves, Christ preserves them from falling. So that it is not possible for them, by any of the cunning craftiness or power of Satan, to be either seduced or dragged out of the hands of Christ. But I think it is useful and will be quite necessary in our first convention, [or Synod] to institute a diligent inquiry from the Scriptures, whether it is not possible for some individuals through negligence to desert the commencement of their existence in Christ, to cleave again to the present evil world, to decline from the sound doctrine which was once delivered to them, to lose a good conscience, and to cause Divine grace to be ineffectual. Though I here openly and ingenuously affirm, I never taught that a ''true believer can, either totally or finally fall away from the faith, and perish''; yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect; and those answers to them which I have been permitted to see, are not of such a kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding. On the other hand, certain passages are produced for the contrary doctrine [of unconditional perseverance] which are worthy of much consideration" (''Works of Arminius,'' 2:219-220). William Nichols notes: "Arminius spoke nearly the same modest words when interrogated on this subject in the last Conference which he had with Gomarus [a Calvinist], before the states of Holland, on the 12th of Aug. 1609, only two months prior to his decease" (''Works of Arminius'', 1:665). B. J. Oropeza says, "Although Arminius denied having taught final apostasy in his ''Declaration of Sentiments'', in the ''Examination of the Treatise of Perkins on the Order and Mode of Predestination'' he writes that a person who is being 'built' into the church of Christ may resist the continuation of this process. Concerning the believers, 'It may suffice to encourage them, if they know that no power or prudence can dislodge them from the rock, unless they of their own will forsake their position.' [''Works of Arminius'', 3:455, cf. 1:667] A believing member of Christ may become slothful, give place to sin, and gradually die altogether, ceasing to be a member. [''Works of Arminius'', 3:458] The covenant of God (Jeremiah 23) 'does not contain in itself an impossibility of defection from God, but a promise of the gift of fear, whereby they shall be hindered from going away from God so long as that shall flourish in their hearts.' If there is any consistency in Arminius' position, he did not seem to deny the possibility of falling away" (''Paul and Apostasy'', 16).&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did affirm like Calvin that believers must continually exercise faith in order to obtain final salvation with God.&lt;ref&gt;Arminius writes: "God resolves to receive into favor those who repent and believe, and to save in Christ, on account of Christ, and through Christ, those who persevere [in faith], but to leave under sin and wrath those who are impenitent and unbelievers, and to condemn them as aliens from Christ" (''Works of Arminius'', 2:465; cf. 2:466). In another place he writes: "[God] wills that they, who believe and persevere in faith, shall be saved, but that those, who are unbelieving and impenitent, shall remain under condemnation" (''Works of Arminius'', 3:412; cf. 3:413).&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Arminius, the [[Remonstrants]] maintained their leader's view that the believer has power through the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit to be victorious over sin, Satan, and the world, and his uncertainty regarding the possibility of apostasy. This is evidenced in the fifth article drafted by its leaders in 1610.&lt;ref&gt;The article reads: That those who are incorporated into Christ by a true faith, and have thereby become partakers of his life-giving Spirit, have thereby full power to strive against Satan, sin, the world, and their own flesh, and to win the victory; it being well understood that it is ever through the assisting grace of the Holy Ghost; and that Jesus Christ assists them through his Spirit in all temptations, extends to them his hand, and if only they are ready for the conflict, and desire his help, and are not inactive, keeps them from falling, so that they, by not craft or power of Satan, can be misled nor plucked out of Christ's hand, according to the Word of Christ, John 10:28: 'Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.'  But whether they are capable, through negligence, of forsaking again the first beginnings of their life in Christ, of again returning to this present evil world, of turning away from the holy doctrine which was delivered them, of losing a good conscience, of becoming devoid of grace, that must be more particularly determined out of the Holy Scripture, before we ourselves can teach it with full persuasion of our minds.(Philip Schaff, editor. ''The Creeds of Christendom Volume III: The Evangelical Protestant Creeds'', "The Articles of the Remonstrants," 3:548-549)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime between 1610, and the official proceeding of the Synod of Dort (1618), the [[Remonstrants]] became fully persuaded in their minds that the Scriptures taught that a true believer was capable of committing apostasy. They formalized their views in "The Opinion of the Remonstrants" (1618). Points three and four in the fifth article read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
True believers can fall from true faith and can fall into such sins as cannot be consistent with true and justifying faith; not only is it possible for this to happen, but it even happens frequently. True believers are able to fall through their own fault into shameful and atrocious deeds, to persevere and to die in them; and therefore finally to fall and to perish.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Y. DeJong, ''Crisis in the Reformed Churches: Essays in Commemoration of the Great Synod of Dordt'', 1618–1619, 220ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reformed Arminian scholar Robert Picirilli remarks: "Ever since that early period, then, when the issue was being examined again, Arminians have taught that those who are truly saved need to be warned against apostasy as a real and possible danger."&lt;ref&gt;''Grace, Faith, Free Will'', 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Important treatments regarding apostasy have come from the following Arminians: Thomas Olivers (1725–1799);&lt;ref&gt;''A Full Refutation of the Doctrine of Unconditional Perseverance: In a Discourse on Hebrews 2:3'' (1790).&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Watson (1781–1833);&lt;ref&gt;''Theological Institutes'' (1851): Volume 2, Chapter 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas O. Summers (1812–1882);&lt;ref&gt;''Systematic Theology: A Complete Body of Wesleyan Arminian Divinity Consisting of Lectures on the Twenty-Five Articles of Religion'' (1888): 2:173-210.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Nash (1812–1900);&lt;ref&gt;''Perseverance and Apostasy: Being an Argument in Proof of the Arminian Doctrine on that Subject'' (1871).&lt;/ref&gt; and William Burt Pope (1822–1903).&lt;ref&gt;''A Compendium of Christian Theology: Being Analytical Outlines of a Course of Theological Study, Biblical, Dogmatic, Historical'' (1879), 3:131-147; ''A Higher Catechism of Theology'' (1883): 276-291.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian denominations that affirm the possibility of apostasy==
The following Christian denominations affirm their belief in the possibility of apostasy in either their articles or statements of faith, or by way of a position paper.
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
*[[Catholic Church]]&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic teaching on apostasy is found in ''The Catechism of the Catholic Church'' (first published in the United States in 1994, and the Second Edition in 2003). According to Pope John Paul II it is "presented as a full, complete exposition of Catholic doctrine" (''Catechism'', "Apostolic Letter"). See sections 161-162; and 1849-1861, obtained at http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/ccc_toc2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Eastern Orthodox Church]]&lt;ref&gt;While the Orthodox Church has no statement of faith or position paper on the possibility of apostasy, two Orthodox resources support the conditional security of the believer and the possibility of apostasy—see http://evangelicalarminians.org/files/Orthodox%20Church%20Affirms%20Conditional%20Security.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]]&lt;ref&gt;"The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord" reads: "Thus many receive the Word with joy, but afterwards fall away again, Luke 8:13. But the cause is not as though God were unwilling to grant grace for perseverance to those in whom He has begun the good work, for that is contrary to St. Paul, Philippians 1:6; but the cause is that they wilfully turn away again from the holy commandment [of God], grieve and embitter the Holy Ghost, implicate themselves again in the filth of the world, and garnish again the habitation of the heart for the devil. With them the last state is worse than the first, 2 Peter 2:10, 20; Ephesians 4:30; Hebrews 10:26; Luke 11:25" (XI. Election, #42, Obtained at http://bookofconcord.org/sd-election.php). Also, "The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord" reads: "Above all, therefore, the false Epicurean delusion is to be earnestly censured and rejected, namely, that some imagine that faith and the righteousness and salvation which they have received can be lost through no sins or wicked deeds, not even through willful and intentional ones, but that a Christian although he indulges his wicked lusts without fear and shame, resists the Holy Ghost, and purposely engages in sins against conscience, yet none the less retains faith, God's grace, righteousness, and salvation. Against this pernicious delusion the following true, immutable, divine threats and severe punishments and admonitions should be often repeated and impressed upon Christians who are justified by faith: 1 Cor. 6:9: Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, etc., shall inherit the kingdom of God. Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5: They which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Rom. 8:13: If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die. Col. 3:6: For which thing's sake the wrath of God cometh upon the children of disobedience" (IV. Good Works, #31-32, obtained at http://bookofconcord.org/sd-goodworks.php)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[The United Methodist Church]]&lt;ref&gt;''Cyclopaedia of Methodism'' (Philadelphia: Louis H. Everts, 1882): "Arminian churches . . . do not believe that those who are converted will necessarily be [finally] saved. They ground their belief further on the warnings which are given by our Savior and his apostles, in teaching the necessity of watchfulness and prayer, in the warnings against falling away contained in many passages of Scripture, and the express declaration that some had been made 'shipwreck of faith' and had fallen away. . . . The Methodist Churches, being Arminian in theology, totally reject the doctrine of the necessary perseverance of the saints, while at the same time they teach that the prayerful and obedient, while they remain in that condition, can never be separated from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. They believe it, however, to be necessary to use all diligence to make their 'calling and election sure'" ("Perseverance, Final," 708-709). Leland Scott, in ''Encyclopedia of World Methodism'', (Nashville: The United Methodist Publishing House, 1974): [John Wesley says] "Arminians hold, that a true believer may 'make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience;' that he may fall, not only foully, but finally, so as to perish forever." (The Question, "What is an Arminian?" Answered. 1770). . . . [According to Wesley] "a man may forfeit the free gift of God, either by sins of omission or commission." ("What is an Arminian?" question 11) How important, therefore, for every believer to beware, "lest his heart be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin;' . . . lest he should sink lower and lower, till he wholly fall away, till he become as salt that hath lost its savor: for if he thus sin willfully, after we have received the experimental 'knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins' . . ." (Sermon on the Mount, IV, i, 8, 1747). . . . Perseverance in grace, therefore, was conditioned upon the believer's persevering! Although the believer continued dependent upon atoning, redeeming grace throughout the course of his salvation, nevertheless—for Wesley—such grace (as seen through Scripture) must be considered finally resistible, the Spirit could finally be quenched. Thus the believer is "saved from the fear, though not from the possibility, of falling away from the grace of God" (Sermon 1. ii. 4.) ("Perseverance, Final," 1888-1889). Mark B. Stokes says: "Other people say, 'once in grace always in grace.' . . . But we United Methodist believe that we are still free to turn away from Christ even while we are Christians. . . . The Bible is filled with examples of people who started out well and ended up tragically. . . . We experience no state of grace which is beyond the possibility of falling" (''Major United Methodist Beliefs'', Revised and Enlarged [Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1990], 117-118). '''Article XII—Of Sin After Justification:''' "Not every sin willingly committed after justification is the sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore, the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after justification. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and, by the grace of God, rise again and amend our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned who say they can no more sin as long as they live here; or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.

After justification, any of us 'may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and, by the grace of God, rise again and amend our lives.' In this Article there is a plain denial of what some call 'eternal security' or 'once saved, always saved,' which claims that once people have received the saving grace of God, they cannot lose their salvation" (''Belief Matters: United Methodism's Doctrinal Standards'' [Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2001], 85).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theologians who affirmed the possibility of apostasy==
[[File:Saint Augustine Portrait.jpg|100px|thumb|[[Augustine]]]]

===Augustine (354–430)===
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] believed "that God's elect will certainly persevere to the end and attain eternal salvation."&lt;ref&gt;John Jefferson Davis, "The Perseverance of the Saints: A History of the Doctrine," ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 34:2 (June 1991), 213.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Reformed scholar John Jefferson Davis,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Augustine does not believe that the Christian can in this life know with infallible certitude that he is in fact among the elect and that he will finally persevere. According to Augustine "it is uncertain whether anyone has received this gift [of perseverance] so long as he is still alive." The believer's life in this world is a state of trial, and he who seems to stand must take heed lest he fall. . . . In fact one's justification and baptismal regeneration could be rejected and lost through [[sin]] and unbelief.&lt;ref&gt;"Perseverance of the Saints," 213-214.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Augustine's views "set the parameters for Aquinas, for the Council of Trent, and for the Roman Catholic tradition generally down to the present day."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, "Perseverance of the Saints," 214. ''So'' Oropeza: [According to Augustine] "The graces of justification and salvation could still be lost" (''Paul and Apostasy'', 10).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)===

Like Augustine, [[Thomas Aquinas]] holds "that one who has been justified by grace stands continually in need of the grace of God, since the justified can turn away and be finally lost."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, "Perseverance of the Saints," 214&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martin Luther (1483–1546)===
[[File:Lucas Cranach d.Ä. - Martin Luther, 1528 (Veste Coburg).jpg|thumb|right|95px|[[Martin Luther]]]]

Like Augustine, [[Martin Luther]] believed that salvation or "regeneration occurred through the waters of baptism."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, "Perseverance of the Saints," 215.&lt;/ref&gt; "But," noted the Reformer, "all of us do not remain with our baptism. Many fall away from Christ and become false Christians." In his commentary on 2 Peter 2:22 he writes as follows on apostates in the Church: "Through baptism these people threw out unbelief, had their unclean way of life washed away, and entered into a pure life of faith and love. Now they fall away into unbelief and their own works, and they soil themselves again in filth."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, "Perseverance of the Saints," 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther held that even if one has experienced the justifying grace of God through faith in Christ, they still "can lose that justification through unbelief or false confidence in works."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Davis, "Perseverance of the Saints," 216.&lt;/ref&gt; In his comments on Galatians 5:4, "Ye are fallen from grace," Luther writes, "To fall from grace means to lose the atonement, the forgiveness of sins, the righteousness, liberty, and life which Jesus has merited for us by His death and resurrection. To lose the grace of God means to gain the wrath and judgment of God, death, the bondage of the devil, and everlasting condemnation."&lt;ref&gt;''Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians'' (1535), translated by Theodore Graebner (Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing House, 1949). Obtained from Project Wittenberg at http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/luther/gal/web/gal5-01.html On Galatians 5:1, "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free," Luther comments: "Our liberty is founded on Christ Himself, who sits at the right hand of God and intercedes for us. Therefore our liberty is sure and valid as long as we believe in Christ. As long as we cling to Him with a steadfast faith we possess His priceless gifts [forgiveness of sins and eternal life are two that Luther mentions in the previous paragraph]. But if we are careless and indifferent we shall lose them. It is not without good reason that Paul urges us to watch and to stand fast. He knew that the devil delights in taking this liberty away from us" (''Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians''). Stephen Pfurtner cites Luther's commentary on Hebrews 3:16, where Lurther warns, "We must therefore fear lest through apostasy we should lose again the beginning of a new creation" (''Luther and Aquinas on Salvation'', 142).&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Luther shared with Augustine, Aquinas, and "the Roman Catholic Church of his day the belief that the grace of baptismal regeneration and justification could be lost."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

===Philip Melancthon (1497–1560)===
[[File:PhilippMelanchthon.jpg|thumb|95px|[[Philip Melanchthon]]]]

[[Philip Melancthon]] wrote a commentary on Romans in 1540. On this particular passage: "Brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live" (Rom. 8:12-13, ESV), Melanchthon calls this "teaching about the new obedience." &lt;ref&gt;Philipp Melanchthon, ''Commentary on Romans'', translated by Fred Kramer [Concordia Publishing House, 2010], 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul gives this teaching so people "born again by faith" "may understand what the obedience in the saints is like, and what is the nature of the sin on account of which they fall from grace and lose faith and the Holy Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Melanchthon, ''Commentary on Romans'', 172.&lt;/ref&gt;  This new obedience "acknowledges God, obeys him, and fights against the impulses of the flesh which carry a person along against the will of God."&lt;ref&gt;Melanchthon, ''Commentary on Romans'', 172.&lt;/ref&gt; When Paul says "'If you mortify the actions of the flesh by the Spirit,' he testifies that there are in saints some sinful actions, namely, concupiscence [i.e., strong sexual desire; lust]; various evil desires; . . . being inflamed with desire for revenge; hatred; avarice [i.e., greed]; etc."&lt;ref&gt; Melanchthon, ''Commentary on Romans'', 173.&lt;/ref&gt; These sins do not lead to "eternal death" when the saints fight against these sins by faith through Christ their mediator. It is

&lt;blockquote&gt;
when those who had been sanctified indulge in and obey such desires, do not fight against them, and are without repentance. Such persons lose faith and the Holy Spirit and are condemned to eternal death unless they return to repentance. Thus when David had become an adulterer, he was without faith and the Holy Spirit, and would have been lost if he had not afterward been restored through repentance. Here belongs what is said in this passage: "If you will live according to the flesh," that is, if you will obey the evil desires, "you will die." The same thought is frequently repeated in Scripture. . . . 1 Cor. 6[:9]: "Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, ... will inherit the kingdom of God." Gal. 5[:21]: "Those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Col. 3[:6]: "On account of which the wrath of God is coming on the disobedient . . ." &lt;ref&gt; Melanchthon, ''Commentary on Romans'', 173. Later in the commentary Melanchthon says, "He [Jesus] sits at the right hand of the Father and saves the believers with divine power, sustains and vivifies them, if only we do not fall away from him" (''Commentary on Romans'', 183). In his ''Annotations on the First Epistle to the Corinthians'', Melanchthon comments on 1 Corinthians 10:1 (which seem to take in the fuller context of verses 2–12) appear to support apostasy. He says Paul "urges them to persevere in the justification which is taking place. His argument is by example. There are also the histories or examples of prophecy in Scripture. The fathers were rejected because of their sins, idolatry, laziness, lust, unbelief, etc. We must therefore be on guard lest the same sins cheat us of salvation" (109).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Puritan John Goodwin demonstrated that Melanchthon fully supported the possibility of Christians committing apostasy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There are two errors . . . of fanatic men, which must briefly be confuted, who conceit that men regenerated cannot lapse” or fall, "and that though they do fall, and this against the light of their conscience, yet they are righteous," or in a state of justification. "This madness is to be condemned, and both instances and sayings from the scriptures of the apostles and prophets are opposed to it. Saul and David pleased God, were righteous, had the Holy Spirit given unto them, yet afterward fell, so that one of them perished utterly; the other returned again to God. There are many sayings" to the same point. And having cited, upon the said account, Matthew 12:43-44; 2 Peter 2:20-21; 1 Corinthians 10:12; Revelation 2:5., he subjoins: "These and the like sayings, being spoken of regenerate men, testify that they may fall, and that in case they fall against their consciences they please not God unless they be converted." Elsewhere thus: "Whereas it hath been said that sins remain in the regenerate, it is necessary that a difference be made; for certain it is that they who rush into sinful practices against conscience do not continue in grace, nor retain faith, righteousness, or the Holy Spirit; neither can faith stand with an evil purpose of heart against conscience." A little after: "But that they fall from grace, and shed faith and the Holy Spirit, and become guilty of the wrath of God and of eternal punishment, who commit sin against conscience, many sayings" in the Scriptures "clearly testify;" to which purpose he cites Galatians  5:19; 1 Corinthians 6:9, etc. . . . Writing upon the those words of the apostle [Paul], 1 Corinthians 10:12, "Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall,"—"But that in some who had the beginnings of faith, and afterwards falling, return not, that faith of theirs was true before it was lost" or shaken out, "the sayings of Peter, 2 Peter 2:20, testifieth."&lt;ref&gt; John Goodwin, ''Redemption Redeemed'', 503-504.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Thomas Helwys (1550–1616)===

[[Thomas Helwys]] was one of the joint founders of the Baptist denomination along with John Smyth. After breaking with Smyth in 1610, Helwys wrote "A Declaration of Faith of English People Remaining at Amsterdam in Holland in 1611."&lt;ref&gt;Joe Early Jr., ''The Life and Writings of Thomas Helwys'', 64. Early says the "purpose of A Declaration of Faith was to differentiate the beliefs of Helwys congregation from that of Smyths" (''Life and Writings of Thomas Helwys'', 64). This Declaration is "Recognized by the majority of Baptist scholars as the first true English Baptist confession of the faith" (Early, ''The Life and Writings of Thomas Helwys'', 64).&lt;/ref&gt; Helwys clearly communicates his stance regarding apostasy in point seven of the Declaration:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Men may fall away from the grace of GOD (Hebrews 12:15) and from the truth, which they have received and acknowledged (Hebrews 10:26) after they have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the HOLY SPIRIT, and have tasted of the good word of GOD, and of the powers of the world to come (Hebrews 6:4, 5). And after they have escaped from the filthiness of the World, may be tangled again therein and overcome (2 Peter 2:20). A righteous man may forsake his righteousness and perish (Ezekiel 18:24, 26). Therefore let no man presume to think that because he has, or once had grace, therefore he shall always have grace. But let all men have assurance, that if they continue to the end, they will be saved. Let no man then presume; but let all work out their salvation with fear and trembling.&lt;ref&gt;Early, ''The Life and Writings of Thomas Helwys'', 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Simon Episcopius (1583–1643)===

[[File:Simon Episcopius.jpg|thumb|right|110px|[[Simon Episcopius]]]]

[[Simon Episcopius]] was the leader of the Remonstrants and primary author of "The Opinions of the Remonstrants 1618" and "The Arminian Confession of 1621."&lt;ref&gt;Keith D. Stanglin says "that the Opinions of the Remonstrants, [was] drawn up by Episcopius in 1618" ("Arminius and Arminianism: An Overview," 17, as found in ''Arminius, Arminianism, and Europe: Jacobus Arminius (1559/60-1609)''). Mark A. Ellis, says the Remonstrants "selected Episcopius and two others to write it [the Confession] but in the end, he did the work alone" ("Introduction," ''The Arminian Confession of 1621'', ix).&lt;/ref&gt; In the Confession the Remonstrants were "persuaded that none is to be easily condemned, or blotted out of the register of Christians who holds fast to faith in Christ, and in hope of the good things promised by him, [and who] seek from the heart to obey his commands . . . ."&lt;ref&gt;''The Arminian Confession of 1621'', Preface, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even if it is true that those who are adept in the habit of faith and holiness can only with difficulty fall back to their former profaneness and dissoluteness of life (Hebrews 6), yet we believe that it is entirely possible, if not rarely done (Hebrews 6:4; Revelation 2 &amp; 3; 2 Peter 2:18; Ezekiel 18:24; Hebrews 4:1–2; 10:28–29; 10:38–39; 1 Timothy 1:19–20; Romans 11:18) that they fall back little by little and until they completely lack their prior faith and charity. And having abandoned the way of righteousness, they revert to their worldly impurity which they had truly left, returning like pigs to wallowing in the mud and dogs to their vomit, and are again entangled in lusts of the flesh which they had formerly, truly fled. And thus totally and at length also they are finally torn from the grace of God unless they seriously repent in time.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arminian Confession of 1621'', 11.7. See "Arminian Confession of 1621 and Apostasy" at http://evangelicalarminians.org/files/Arminian%20Confession%20of%201621%20and%20Apostasy.pdf In "The Opinions of the Remonstrants 1618" points three and four in the fifth article read: "True believers can fall from true faith and can fall into such sins as cannot be consistent with true and justifying faith; not only is it possible for this to happen, but it even happens frequently. True believers are able to fall through their own fault into shameful and atrocious deeds, to persevere and to die in them; and therefore finally to fall and to perish." See "The Opinions of the Remonstrants (1618)" at http://evangelicalarminians.org/files/Opinions%20of%20the%20Remonstrants%20%281618%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===John Goodwin (1594–1665)===
[[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]] was a Puritan who "presented the Arminian position of falling away in ''Redemption Redeemed'' (1651)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Goodwins work was primarily dedicated to refuting the Calvinist doctrine of limited atonement, but he digresses from his main topic and spends 300 pages attempting to disprove the Calvinist doctrine of unconditional perseverance.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Redemption Redeemed'', 226–527. Goodwin's book can be read at http://evangelicalarminians.org/Goodwin-Redemption-Redeemed&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Bunyan (1628–1688)===
Apostasy receives allegorical treatment in [[John Bunyan]]'s [[Pilgrim's Progress]]. Christian and his companion Hopeful, soon after their first encounter with Ignorance, "entered into a very dark lane, where they met a man whom seven devils had bound with seven strong cords, and were carrying him back to the door that they saw on the side of the Hill."&lt;ref&gt;John Bunyan, ''The Pilgrim's Progress'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian believes he recognizes the captive as Turn-Away, who dwells in the town of Apostacy.

===Thomas Grantham (1634–1692)===

[[Thomas Grantham (Baptist)|Thomas Grantham]] "was for many years the principal minister among the General Baptists," and he wrote "chiefly in explanation or defense of Baptist sentiments. The largest was a folio volume, entitled ''Christianismus Primitivus''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://baptistlibraryonline.com/blo//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=2&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=25 baptistlibraryonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In it he writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
That such who are true believers, even branches of Christ the vine, and that in the account of Christ whom he exhorts to abide in him, or such who have Charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned, 1 Timothy 1:5, may nevertheless for want of watchfulness, swerve and turn aside from the same, and become dead branches, cast into the fire, and burned [John 15:6]. But such who add unto their Faith Virtue, and unto Virtue Knowledge, and unto Knowledge Temperance, &amp;c. such shall never fall [2 Peter 1:5–10], for they are kept by the power of God though Faith unto Salvation [1 Peter 1:5].&lt;ref&gt;''Christianismus Primitives'', 2:70. In ''A Dialogue Between the Baptist and the Presbyterian'', the exchange appears to reveal Grantham's belief in apostasy: "Presbyterian: . . . It is certain that Judas could not but betray Christ, seeing God’s Decrees are immutable. . . . Baptist: . . . And as to the Instance of Judas, Antiquity is against you. For thus saith Chrysostom, Judas, my Beloved, was at first a Child of the Kingdom, when he heard it said to him with the Disciples, Ye shall sit on twelve Thrones; but at last he became a Child of Hell. Chrysostom Orat. 52 as quoted by Mr. John Goodwin. Presbyterian: I perceive you hold that a Child of God may possibly fall away and perish. This is a dangerous Error. Baptist: That Some may depart from the Faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, is clear in the Word of God [1 Timothy 4:1] . . . . For my part, though I doubt not but there is a state attainable, even in this Life, from which by the Grace of God Christians shall not fall, yet I hold it a vanity for any Man to affirm of himself, or of any other Person in particular, that it is impossible for him to fall. I hold it better by far, for the best, as well as others, to take heed lest they fall [1 Corinthians 10:12]. (19–20)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===John Wesley (1703–1791)===

[[File:John_Wesley_by_William_Hamilton.jpg|thumb|105px|[[John Wesley]]]]

[[John Jefferson Davis]] writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the treatise "Predestination Calmly Considered" [[John Wesley|Wesley]] observed that believers might infer from their own experience of grace that it is impossible to finally fall away. Nevertheless, whatever assurance God might give to particular souls "I find no general promise in holy writ, that none who once believes shall finally fall." Scripture, and not personal experience or inferences drawn from it, states Wesley, must be decisive in the matter. In his treatise "Serious Thoughts on the Perseverance of the Saints" Wesley allows that the apostle Paul—and many believers today—were fully persuaded of their final perseverance.  Nevertheless such an assurance does not prove that every believer will persevere or that every believer enjoys such assurance. Based on his reading of Hebrews 6:4, 6; 10:26–29; 2 Peter 2:20–21 and other NT texts, Wesley is persuaded that a true believer can make shipwreck of his faith and perish everlastingly.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, "Perseverance of the Saints," 224.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Implications==
Michael Fink writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Apostasy is certainly a biblical concept, but the implications of the teaching have been hotly debated.&lt;ref&gt;McKnight adds: "Because apostasy is disputed among Christian theologians, it must be recognized that ones overall hermeneutic and theology (including ones general philosophical orientation) shapes how one reads texts dealing with apostasy." ''Dictionary of Theological Interpretation of the Bible'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate has centered on the issue of apostasy and salvation. Based on the concept of God's sovereign grace, some hold that, though true believers may stray, they will never totally fall away. Others affirm that any who fall away were never really saved. Though they may have "believed" for a while, they never experienced regeneration. Still others argue that the biblical warnings against apostasy are real and that believers maintain the freedom, at least potentially, to reject God's salvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', "Apostasy," 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McKnight says that "apostasy ought not to be used as a continual threat so much as an occasional warning of the disaster that Christians may bring upon themselves if they do not examine themselves. As a warning, apostasy can function as a moral injunction that strengthens commitment to holiness as well as the need to turn in complete trust to God in Christ through his Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Theological Interpretation of the Bible'', 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some argue that the desire for salvation shows one does not have "an evil, unbelieving heart" leading to apostasy.&lt;ref&gt;''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;  As Fink puts it, "persons worried about apostasy should recognize that conviction of sin in itself is evidence that one has not fallen away."&lt;ref&gt;''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', 87&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aronow v. United States''''' was the first case to challenge the inclusion of "[[In God We Trust]]" on [[United States dollar|U.S. currency]].&lt;ref name="AronowUS"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Aronow v. United States |vol=432 |no=23444 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=242 |pinpoint=243 |court=9th Cir. |date=October 6, 1970 |url=http://openjurist.org/432/f2d/242/aronow-v-united-states}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law it challenged was "31 U.S.C. § 324a "the inscription 'In God we Trust'...shall appear on all United States currency and coins".&lt;ref name="AronowUS"/&gt;

In 1970, Stefan Ray Aronow having been found without standing to sue by the District Court, appealed his case to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] challenging "the use of expressions of trust in God by the United States Government on its coinage, currency, official documents and publications. Specifically, the action challenged the constitutionality as repugnant to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of two federal statutes."&lt;ref name="AronowUS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Finding Dulcinea'' Staff (2011). [http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/July-August-08/On-this-Day---In-God-We-Trust--Becomes-U-S--Motto.html "On This Day: 'In God We Trust' Becomes Motto of the United States."] (July 30). Retrieved 11-6-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Appeals Court, following the precedent of ''[[Massachusetts v. Mellon]]'', agreed with the District Court that the plaintiff did not have [[Standing (law)|standing]] as "a taxpayer and citizen",&lt;ref name="AronowUS"/&gt; but set aside the question of standing to rule on the [[Merit (legal)|merits]] of the case.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Derek (2010). ''Oxford Handbook of Church and State in the United States''. New York: Oxford Handbooks Online, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WX2LcraS1EgC&amp;pg=PA305 p. 305.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court ruled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is quite obvious that the national motto and the slogan on coinage and currency 'In God We Trust' has nothing whatsoever to do with the [[establishment clause|establishment of religion]]. Its use is of patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise. ...It is not easy to discern any religious significance attendant the payment of a bill with coin or currency on which has been imprinted 'In God We Trust' or the study of a government publication or document bearing that slogan. In fact, such secular uses of the motto was viewed as sacrilegious and irreverent by President Theodore Roosevelt. Yet Congress has directed such uses. While 'ceremonial' and 'patriotic' may not be particularly apt words to describe the category of the national motto, it is excluded from First Amendment significance because the motto has no theological or ritualistic impact. As stated by the Congressional report, it has 'spiritual and psychological value' and 'inspirational quality.'&lt;ref name="AronowUS"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court cited ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' which held 
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is of course nothing in the decision reached here [banning government led prayer in public schools] that is inconsistent with the fact that school children and others are officially encouraged to express love for our country by...Such patriotic or ceremonial occasions bear no true resemblance to the unquestioned religious exercise that the State of New York has sponsored in this instance.&lt;ref name="AronowUS"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court held the practice was constitutional using the reasoning established in ''[[McGowan v. Maryland]]''. The Court maintained that the national motto has no purpose in a coercive power to aid religion - neither on the face of the legislation nor in its operative effect (its practical impact on society).

The Court also cited the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]' decision of ''[[Walz v. Tax Commission]]'', quoting 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The course of constitutional neutrality in this area cannot be an absolutely straight line...The general principle deducible from the First Amendment and all that has been said by the Court is this: that we will not tolerate either governmentally established religion or governmental interference with religion. Short of those expressly proscribed governmental acts there is room for play in the joints productive of a benevolent neutrality which will permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without interference. ...Adherence to the policy of neutrality that derives from an accommodation of the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses has prevented the kind of involvement that would tip the balance toward government control of churches or governmental restraint on religious practice.&lt;ref name="AronowUS"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the case.&lt;ref name="Duncan"/&gt;

A similar decision was reached by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit]] in ''[[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] vs [[W. Michael Blumenthal]]'' in 1979, which affirmed that the "primary purpose of the slogan was secular."&lt;ref name="Duncan"&gt;Duncan, Ann W. (2008). ''Church-state Issues in America Today''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1440">'''Attalus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|t|ə|l|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Ἄτταλος}}) was a [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] in the reign of [[Tiberius]] around 25 AD, who was defrauded of his property by [[Sejanus]], and reduced to cultivating the ground.&lt;ref name="seneca1"&gt;Seneca, ''Suasoriae'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught the [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]],&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistles.'' 108.&lt;/ref&gt; who frequently quotes him, and speaks of him in the highest terms.&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''Naturales Quaestiones'', ii. 50, ''Epistles'', 9, 63, 67, 72. 81, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seneca the Elder|elder Seneca]] describes him&lt;ref name="seneca1"/&gt; as a man of great eloquence, and by far the acutest philosopher of his age. We have mention of a work of his on lightning;&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Naturales Quaestiones'', ii. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is supposed that he may be the author of the ''Proverbs'' referred to by [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]&lt;ref&gt;Hesychius, ''Korinnousi''.&lt;/ref&gt; as written by one Attalus.

== `Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan ==

[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention [[Latin America]]n regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The first actions on the part of Bahá'í community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to [[Mexico]] and [[South America]] near or before this unavailing in 1919&lt;!-- Mr. Lamb says 1916 but it is established that at least Tobey became a Bahá'í in 1918 and visited in 1931 --&gt;, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and [[Hands of the Cause#Appointed posthumously by Shoghi Effendi|Roy C. Wilhelm]], and [[Martha Root]]. Root's travels, perhaps the first Bahá'í to the region, began in the summer of 1919 - stopping first in Brazil then other countries before setting out to cross the Andes mountains into Chile in winter.&lt;ref name="root"&gt;{{cite web | last = Allmar | first = Husayn | title = Martha Root’s Journey to Chile | work = The Chilean Temple Initiative | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United State | year = 2007 | url = http://www.chilean-temple.org/content/view/27/45/ | accessdate = 2008-03-05 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080323081114/http://www.chilean-temple.org/content/view/27/45/ | archivedate = 2008-03-23 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url= http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"His Holiness [[Christ]] says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the [[Kingdom of God]]. … Attach great importance to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population of America ... the republics of the continent of South America—[[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], [[the Guianas]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Paraguay]], [[Venezuela]]; also the islands to the north, east and west of South America, such as [[Falkland Islands]], the [[Galápagos Islands|Galapagòs]], [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernandez]], [[Trinidad and Tobago|Tobago and Trinidad]]...."&lt;ref name="Tablets" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the release of these tablets and then `Abdu'l-Bahá's death in 1921, a few Bahá'ís began moving to or at least visiting Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt;

=== Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades ===

[[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bahá'í administration#National|Bahá'í Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt; In his cable he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by `Abdu'l-Bahá in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |origyear = |year = 1947 |title = Messages to America |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |oclc =  5806374 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-16.html.iso8859-1?query=Appeal |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to be established in all the countries of Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt; The Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the ''First Seven Year Plan'' (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]] began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America.

=== Establishment ===

Paraguayan Maria Casati met some of these Bahá'ís in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina and converted to the religion in 1939.&lt;ref name="basic" /&gt; The first pioneer to arrive in Paraguay was Elizabeth Cheney in December&lt;ref name="basic" /&gt; 1940. Cheney describes that many of the people she thought to be introduced to were in jail when she arrived.&lt;ref name="Sept41"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Remarks on Publicity by a Pioneer Teacher |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1941 | issue = 146 |pages=4–6 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However through word-of-mouth from a few she was able to gather a group of 30 of social prominence and interested in universal peace which mentioned the religion and avoid negative connotations (for example by use of the word universal vs international when describing the kind of peace Bahá'ís were interested in.) The group first met by January 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-American News; Asuncion, Paraguay |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1941 | issue = 143 | page =6 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a youth group was meeting by June&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-American News; Paraguay |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1941 | issue = 143 | page =11 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite social upset from the period before World War II and President [[History of Paraguay#Mor.C3.ADnigo and World War II|Morínigo]]. Indeed, Cheney had rented her apartment from Sra. Leonar de Morínigo with whom she had shared Bahá'í principles to know what kind of meetings would take place - who in turn defended the religion from accusations by September from a local catholic priest.&lt;ref name="Sept41" /&gt; Cheney did not seek out publicity because of the social conflict going on and her experience of events in Argentina. She also emphasized sincerity, patience, and a universal quality of showing love for all people to encourage the same among the group and beware of showing any sense of superiority whether from nationalism or a self-consciousness in the role of bringing the religion to people. Come September 15 adults expressed interest in taking part in a further class on the religion. Cheney also began English language classes modeled after [[Lidia Zamenhof]]'s advice as well use using stories about the religion as the medium for learning the language in addition to the meetings directly for those wanting to learn more about the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-American News; Paraguay |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1941 | issue = 146 | page =3 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; One member of the group attended an International Conference of Progressive Education by October in the States and through contact with the Cheney was invited to [[Louhelen Bahá'í School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = North America Teaching |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1941 | issue = 147 |pages=7–8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; But come November Cheney was taken ill and left Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-American News; Paraguay |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1941 | issue = 148 | page =4 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; On returning to the States she took up work in Race Amity meetings with [[Louis G. Gregory]] and [[Dorothy Beecher Baker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = National Committees; Race Unity |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1943 | issue = 148 |pages=13–14 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = New Pamphlets|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1944 | issue = 169 | page =7 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth ===

Shoghi Effendi called for further strengthening of the community in 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |origyear = |year = 1947 |title = Messages to America |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |oclc =  5806374 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-79.html.iso8859-1#pg65 | page = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first to come back to Paraguay was Gertrude Eisenberg in spring 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-American News |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1943 | issue = 160 | page =3 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nov45"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-American News; Multiplication of Groups |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1945 | issue = 177 | page =8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next pioneer to come was Virginia Orbison in September&lt;!-- note mention of Feast of Might in source is September 8th --&gt; 1943 after helping to found an Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-American News; New Assemblies |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1943 | issue = 148 | page =4 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-American News; South America |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1943 | issue = 148 |pages=7–8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Orbison arrived in addition to Eisenberg there was another Bahá'í of the group who had already acknowledged himself as a Bahá'í in the interim and two more of the original group converted at the first meeting Orbison attended in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-American News; South America |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1944 | issue = 167 | page =7 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] of Paraguay was elected in [[Asunción]]&lt;ref name="GPB" /&gt; in 1944.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt; An All-American Convention was held in 1944, and actor [[:es:Roque Centurión Miranda|Don Roque Centurión Miranda]], counted as the first Bahá'í of Paraguay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = First All South American Conference |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1946 | issue = 190 | page =2 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a delegate,&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt; (and Cheney was able to visit the convention.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Letter from the National Spiritual Assembly |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1944 | issue = 169 | page =4 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheney returned to Paraguay in 1945 to find a community of 26 Bahá'ís and so she moved to Nicaragua in October&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-America News; Itinerant Teachers |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1946 | issue = 179 | page =4 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenberg moved in November.&lt;ref name="Nov45" /&gt; A regional committee overseeing pioneers was appointed in 1946 - one for Chili, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-America News Regional Committees |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1946 | issue = 186 | page =5 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first South American Bahá'í Congress was celebrated in Buenos Aires in November, 1946 with representatives R. Centurion Miranda and Josephine Pla from Paraguay.

=== Reforming the Paraguayan community ===

Retrospectively, a stated purpose for the regional committee was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Historical Background of the Panama Temple|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1972 | issue = 493 | page =2 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. By 1950 there was still an assembly in Asunción.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; However, by November 1950 Sheila Rice-Wray transferred her pioneering effort to Paraguay in 1950 where an emergency election was held for vacancies to assure representation to the first South American Bahá'í Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Latin American; In South America |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1950 | issue = 186 | page =8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter.America Committee Report A Mid-Year Analysis; South Ameriea |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1951 | issue = 239 | page =8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice-Way was able to "reactivate" members of the Asunción community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Historical Background of the Panama Temple|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1950 | issue = 236 | page =8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also joined by Esteban Canales in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-America News; Pioneer Arrivals |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1950 | issue = 237 | page =6 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Rice-Way and Canales were delegates to the South American convention to elect the regional assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Notes on Latin America |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1951 | issue = 243 | page =6 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the regional National Assembly of South America was elected in 1951 the members included Paraguayan Esteban Canales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Latin America Holds First Historic Conventions; Historic Elections |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1951 | issue = 243 | page =12 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 translations of Bahá'í literature were made into [[Guarani language|Guarani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = International News; First Baha'i Literature in Guarani |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1953 | issue = 273 | page =14 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1954 Ellen Sims arrived as another pioneer in Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Ninth Pioneer Report; Arrivals in Consolidation Areas |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1954 | issue = 284 | page =4 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1955 the Bahá'ís of Paraguay dedicated their permanent Bahá'í Headquarters with an hour-long program with talks in Guarani, Spanish and English, slides and pictures of Bahá'í building and Shrines around the world, and book displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Paraguay Hazira Dedicated |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1956 | issue = 299 | page =4 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continued growth ==

The regional assembly was reorganized in 1957 to be made up of Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay &amp; Bolivia. Among its members was Miranda of Paraguay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Public Meeting at the National School of Drama… |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1957 | issue = 322 | page =10 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1958 saw the first Bahá'í summer school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Public Meeting at the National School of Drama… |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1958 | issue = 327 | page =20 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1958 convention gathered twenty-four delegates in Asuncion from the five countries, including black, white, and Indian races as delegates as well as European and American pioneers. The elected members of the regional national assembly were Jose Mielnik, Athas Costas, Salvador Torma, Roberto Cazcarra, Roque Centurion Miranda, Else Cazcarra, Fabienne Guillon, Mary Binda, and Ellen Sims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1958 | issue = 329 |pages=20–21 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1958 also saw the purchase of the land to one day host the Bahá'í Temple of Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Guardian's Last Wish For Paraguay Realized With Dedication of Temple Site |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1958 | issue = 335 | page =9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1960 saw the election of the local assembly of [[Encarnación, Paraguay|Encarnación]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1960 | issue = 353 | page =5 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1960 also saw the first visit of a [[Hand of the Cause]], Dr. Hermann Grossmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Left: Hand of the Cause Dr. Hermann Grossmann |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1960 | issue = 353 | page =4 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 each country of the regional assembly elected its own National Spiritual Assembly.&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt; Paraguay's national convention was witnessed by Hand of the Cause, Dr. Ramatu'llah Muhajir. At the convention Dr. Muhajir and the delegates drew up plans for reaching the Indian populations as well as ways to reinforce the communities that already existed. The members of Paraguay's first National Spiritual Assembly were Asadu'llah Akbari, Keihamosh Azampanah, A.

'''Behesht-e Zahra''' ({{lang-fa|بهشت زهرا|}},''The Paradise of Zahra'', from [[Fatima az-Zahra]]), is the largest [[cemetery]] in [[Iran]].

==History==
In the early 1950s, all the cemeteries in Tehran were supposed to be replaced by several large new ones outside the then precincts of the capital.  Behesht-e Zahra was built in late 1960s on the southern side of Teheran towards the direction of the city of [[Qom]] and opened in 1970. The first person buried in Behesht-e Zahra was Mohammad-Taghi Khial.

Many of the deceased soldiers of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] were buried in the martyr's section of the graveyard.&lt;ref name=meq7&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alfoneh|first=Ali|title=Iran's Suicide Brigades|journal=Middle East Quarterly|date=Winter 2007|volume=XIV|issue=7|pages=37–44|url=http://www.meforum.org/1059/irans-suicide-brigades|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goltz2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Goltz|title=Azerbaijan Diary: A Rogue Reporter's Adventures in an Oil-rich, War-torn, Post-Soviet Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m2vxBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442&amp;dq=thomas+goltz+martyr+witnessed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS2Pv47YLKAhUM7SYKHUJ0CSYQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20goltz%20martyr%20witnessed&amp;f=false|date=8 April 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47624-5|pages=442–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that [[Buddha]] once in his life came to this region [[East Bengal]] to spread Buddhism and he was successful to convert the local people of [[East Bengal]] to [[Buddhism]]. [[Buddhism]] is now the third largest [[Religion in Bangladesh|religion]] in [[Bangladesh]] with about 0.7% of population adhering to [[Theravada Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banbeis.gov.bd/bd_pro.htm|title=Bangladesh : AT A GLANCE|publisher=|accessdate=27 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132048/http://www.banbeis.gov.bd/bd_pro.htm|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 65% of the Buddhist population is concentrated in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] region, where Buddhism the predominant faith of the [[Chakma people|Chakma]], [[Marma people|Marma]], [[Tanchangya people|Tanchangya]], other [[Jumma people]] and the [[Barua (Bangladesh)|Barua]], while the remaining 35% of the population are from the [[Bengali Buddhist]] community. Buddhist communities are present in the urban centers of Bangladesh, particularly [[Chittagong]] and [[Dhaka]].

== Demographic overview ==
As of 2014, followers of Buddhism are mainly people of Baruas living in Chittagong city, the business city of Bangladesh and indigenous Arakanese descent living in the sub-tropical Chittagong Hill Tracts. People who follow Buddhism in Bangladesh belong to the Barua people in majority with the percentage of 65% among the 0.07% population of Bangladesh, [[Chakma people|Chakma]], [[Chak people|Chak]], [[Marma people|Marma]], [[Tanchangya people|Tanchangya]] and the [[Khyang people|Khyang]], who had been since time immemorial have practiced Buddhism. Other tribes, notably those who practice Animism, have come under some Buddhist influence, and this is true in the case of the [[Khumi]] and the [[Mru]], and to a lesser extent on the other tribes.

== History ==
[[File:Buddha sculpture in Mahasthangarh.jpg|right|thumb|The earliest statue of Buddha found in Mahasthangarh]]
Legend said that [[Gautama Buddha]] came to the region to spread Buddhism, and it was speculated that one or two individuals became monks to follow in his footsteps. However, Buddhism did not gain much support until the reign of [[Asoka]] when Buddhism gained a toehold. The [[Pala Empire]] that controlled the Indian subcontinent spread many Buddhist ideologies in modern Bangladesh and built many monasteries such as the [[Mahasthangarh]] and the [[Somapura Mahavihara]]. During the Pala Dynasty, a famous teacher named [[Atisha]] was born in the city of [[Bikrampur]] and spread Mahayana Buddhism.

[[Candra|Chandra Dynasty]]'s Puranchandra and Subarnachandra adopted Buddhism, as did their successors Trailokyachandra and Srichandra who ruled Harikel and Chandradwip (Barisal).&lt;ref&gt;P. 22 European Trade and Colonial Conquest: Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Khadga Dynasty]] was a Buddhist dynasty of kings that carried the surname Bhatt. They made several temples and monasteries. King Rajabhata was for example a very committed Mahayanist Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;P. 261 Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism: The Mahayana Context of the Gau?apadiya By Richard King&lt;/ref&gt; 

Buddhism in various forms appears to have been prevalent at the time of the Turkish conquest in 1202.&lt;ref name=Country&gt;{{Country study

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invading armies apparently found numerous monasteries, which they destroyed. With the destruction of centers of Buddhist learning, such as [[Nalanda University]], Buddhism rapidly disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vajrayana.faithweb.com/rich_text_3.html|title=Caryagiti|publisher=|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent centuries and up through the 1980s nearly all the remaining Buddhists lived in the region around [[Chittagong]], which had not been entirely conquered until the time of the [[British Raj]] (1858–1947). During the 19th century, a revival movement developed&lt;ref name="buddhistdoor.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistdoor.net/features/jewel-in-the-crown-bengals-buddhist-revival-in-the-19th-and-20th-centuries|title=Jewel in the Crown: Bengal's Buddhist Revival in the 19th and 20th Centuries}}&lt;/ref&gt; that led to the development of two orders of Theravada monks, the [[Sangharaj Nikaya]] and the [[Mahasthabir Nikaya]].

In the Chittagong Hills, Buddhist tribes formed the majority of the population, and their religion appeared to be a mixture of tribal beliefs and Buddhist doctrines. According to the 1981 census, there were approximately 538,000 Buddhists in Bangladesh, representing less than 1 percent of the population.

==Culture==
[[File:Atisha.jpg|thumb|[[Atisha]] is one of the ancient priests from the Pala dynasty who is followed within the Bangladeshi Buddhist sects.]]
There are several monasteries in the Chittagong, and in most Buddhist villages there is a school (kyong) where boys live and learn to read  Bengali (national language) and some Pali (an ancient Buddhist scriptural language).&lt;ref name=Country/&gt; It is common for men who have finished their schooling to return at regular intervals for periods of residence in the school. The local Buddhist shrine is often an important center of village life.

Buddhism outside the monastic retreats has absorbed and adapted indigenous popular creeds and beliefs of the regions to which it has spread.&lt;ref name=Country/&gt; In most areas religious ritual focuses on the image of the Buddha, and the major festivals observed by Buddhists in Bangladesh commemorate the important events of his life. Although doctrinal Buddhism rejects the worship of gods and preserves the memory of the Buddha as an enlightened man, popular Buddhism contains a pantheon of gods and lesser deities headed by the Buddha.

The Ministry of Religious Affairs provides assistance for the maintenance of Buddhist places of worship and relics.&lt;ref name=Country/&gt; The ancient monasteries at [[Paharpur, Bangladesh|Paharpur]] (in [[Rajshahi]] Region) and [[Mainamati]] (in [[Comilla]] Region), dating from the seventh to ninth century A.D., are considered unique for their size and setting and are maintained as state-protected monuments.

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|right|thumb|220px|A [[Greco-Buddhist]] statue of Siddartha Gautama (Buddha) preaching. The Greeks are believed to have introduced the practice of figural representations of the Buddha. (See [[Greco-Buddhist art]].)]]

Some scholars believe that there exist significant '''Buddhist influences on Christianity''' reaching back to Christianity's earliest days. Buddhism was known in the pre-Christian Greek world, and hence the later [[Roman Empire]], through the campaigns of [[Alexander the Great]] (see [[Greco-Buddhism]] and [[Greco-Buddhist monasticism]]). Several prominent early Christian fathers ([[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Jerome|St. Jerome]]) were certainly aware of the Buddha, even mentioning him in their works.&lt;ref name="McEvilley, p391"&gt;McEvilley, p391&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]] Stromata. BkI, Ch XV http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.vi.iv.i.xv.html (Accessed 19 Dec 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of Buddhist influence in early Christian history, however, remains controversial.

Some historians such as [[Jerry H. Bentley]] and [[Elaine Pagels]] suggest that there is a possibility that Buddhism influenced the early development of Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times |first=Jerry H. |last=Bentley |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-19-507640-0 |page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been suggestions of an indirect path in which Indian Buddhism may have influenced [[Gnosticism]] and then Christianity.&lt;ref name=Thundy/&gt;  Some scholars hold that the suggested similarities are coincidental since parallel traditions may emerge in different cultures.&lt;ref name=Grau/&gt;

In the East, the [[syncretism]] between [[Nestorian Christianity]] and Buddhism was deep and widespread along the [[Silk Road]], and was especially pronounced in the medieval [[Church of the East in China]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 13th century, international travelers, such as [[Giovanni de Piano Carpini]] and [[William of Ruysbroeck]], sent back reports of Buddhism to the West and noted the similarities to [[Nestorian Christian]] beliefs. Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism, 2004, page 160&lt;/ref&gt; There are also historical documents showing the syncretic nature of Christianity and Buddhism in Asia such as the [[Jesus Sutras]] and [[Nestorian Stele]].{{citation needed lead|date=April 2016}}

Despite suggestions of surface level analogies, [[Buddhism and Christianity]] have inherent and fundamental differences at the deepest levels, such as [[monotheism]]'s place at the core of Christianity and Buddhism's orientation towards [[non-theism]].&lt;ref name=Numrich10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lim34/&gt; The majority of modern scholars who have studied both Buddhism and Christianity hold that there is no direct historical evidence of any influence by Buddhism on early Christianity.&lt;ref name=Buswell&gt;''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (Volume One) by Robert E. Buswell (Feb 2004) {{ISBN|0028657195}} Macmillan pages 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leslie140&gt;''Jesus: The Complete Guide'' by J. L. Houlden (Feb 8, 2006) {{ISBN|082648011X}} pages 140-144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PaulaF26/&gt; Scholars generally consider any such influence implausible given that first century Jews are highly unlikely to have been open to far eastern concepts that appeared opposed to some of their basic beliefs.&lt;ref name=Eddy53/&gt;

==Early Christianity==
[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|250px|Bilingual edict ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) 3rd century BC by Indian Buddhist King Ashoka, see [[Edicts of Ashoka]], from [[Kandahar]]. This edict advocates the adoption of "godliness" using the Greek term [[Eusebeia]] for [[Dharma]]. [[Kabul]] Museum.]]

===Suggestions of influence===
[[Will Durant]], noting that the [[Ashoka the Great|Emperor Ashoka]] sent [[missionary|missionaries]], not only to elsewhere in India and to Sri Lanka, but to [[ancient Syria|Syria]], [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[ancient Greece|Greece]], first speculated in the 1930s that they may have helped prepare the ground for Christian teaching.&lt;ref&gt;1. Will Durant, The Story of Civilization: Our Oriental Heritage, Part One (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1935), vol. 1, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism was prominent in the eastern Greek world ([[Greco-Buddhism]]) and became the official religion of the eastern Greek successor kingdoms to [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire ([[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] (250 BC-125 BC) and [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] (180 BC - 10 CE)).  Several prominent Greek Buddhist missionaries are known ([[Mahadharmaraksita]] and [[Dharmaraksita]]) and the Indo-Greek king [[Menander I]] converted to Buddhism, and is regarded as one of the great patrons of Buddhism.  (See [[Milinda Panha]].) Some modern historians have suggested that the pre-Christian monastic order in Egypt of the [[Therapeutae]] is possibly a deformation of the Pāli word "[[Theravada|Theravāda]],"&lt;ref&gt;See Zacharias P. Thundy, Buddha and Christ
Nativity Stories and Indian Traditions (Leiden: Brill, 1992), 244-5.&lt;/ref&gt; a form of Buddhism, and the movement may have "almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism".&lt;ref&gt;Thundy, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; They may even have been descendants of [[Asoka]]'s emissaries to the West.&lt;ref&gt;Thundy, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; It is true that Buddhist gravestones from the [[Ptolemaic period]] have also been found in Alexandria in Egypt, decorated with depictions of the [[Dharmacakra|Dharma wheel]], showing the Buddhists were living in Hellenistic Egypt at the time Christianity began.&lt;ref&gt;The Greeks in Bactria and India, W.W. Tarn, South Asia Books, {{ISBN|81-215-0220-9}}'&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Buddhists in [[Alexandria]] has led one author to note: "It was later in this very place that some of the most active centers of Christianity were established".{{cn|date=March 2016}}
The early church father [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died 215 AD) was also aware of Buddha, writing in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV): "The Indian [[gymnosophists]] are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called [[Śramaṇa|Sarmanæ]] and others [[Brahmin]]s. And those of the Sarmanæ who are called "Hylobii" neither inhabit cities, nor have roofs over them, but are clothed in the bark of trees, feed on nuts, and drink water in their hands. Like those called Encratites in the present day, they know not marriage nor begetting of children. Some, too, of the Indians obey the precepts of [[Buddha]] (Βούττα) whom, on account of his extraordinary sanctity, they have raised to divine honours."&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria Stromata. BkI, Ch XV http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.vi.iv.i.xv.html (Accessed 19 Dec 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolaus of Damascus]], and other ancient writers, relate that in AD 13, at the time of [[Augustus]] (died AD 14), he met in [[Antioch]] (near present day [[Antakya]] in [[Turkey]] just over 300 miles from [[Jerusalem]]) an embassy with a letter written in Greek from the Southern India Pandya Empire was delivered while Caesar was in the Island of Samos. This embassy was  accompanied by a sage who later, naked, anointed and contented, burnt himself to death at Athens.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geography'' Bk XV, Ch1, 73&lt;/ref&gt; The details of his tomb inscription specified he was a [[Shramana]], "his name was [[Zarmanochegas]]", he was an Indian native of Bargosa, and "immortalized himself according to the custom of his country." [[Cassius Dio]] &lt;ref&gt;''Hist'' 54.9,&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Plutarch]] &lt;ref&gt;69,1&lt;/ref&gt; cite the same story. Historian [[Jerry H. Bentley]] (1993) notes "the possibility that Buddhism influenced the early development of Christianity" and  that scholars "have drawn attention to many parallels concerning the births, lives, doctrines, and deaths of the Buddha and Jesus".&lt;ref name="Bentley 1993"&gt;{{cite book |title=Old World Encounters. Cross-cultural contacts and exchanges in pre-modern times |first=Jerry H. |last=Bentley |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-507639-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, the book ''The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ'' by [[Nicolas Notovitch]] introduced the idea that an adult Jesus traveled to India and was influenced by Buddhism before starting [[Ministry of Jesus|his ministry]] in [[Galilee]]. The book was widely disseminated and became the basis of other theories.&lt;ref&gt;''The Unknown Life Of Jesus Christ: By The Discoverer Of The Manuscript'' by Nicolas Notovitch (Oct 15, 2007) {{ISBN|1434812839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ehrm252&gt;''Forged: Writing in the Name of God--Why the Bible's Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are'' by Bart D. Ehrman (Mar 6, 2012) {{ISBN|0062012622}} page 252 "one of the most widely disseminated modern forgeries is called ''The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ''"&lt;/ref&gt; Notovitch's theory was controversial from the beginning and was widely criticized.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon J. Joseph]], "Jesus in India?" ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'' Volume 80, Issue 1 pp. 161-199 "Max Müller suggested that either the Hemis monks had deceived Notovitch or that Notovitch himself was the author of these passages"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wil84/&gt; Once his story had been re-examined by historians, Notovitch confessed to having fabricated the evidence.&lt;ref name=Wil84&gt;''New Testament Apocrypha, Vol. 1: Gospels and Related Writings'' by [[Wilhelm Schneemelcher]] and R. Mcl. Wilson (Dec 1, 1990) {{ISBN|066422721X}} page 84 "a particular book by Nicolas Notovich (Di Lucke im Leben Jesus 1894) ... shortly after the publication of the book, the reports of travel experiences were already unmasked as lies. The fantasies about Jesus in India were also soon recognized as invention... down to today, nobody has had a glimpse of the manuscripts with the alleged narratives about Jesus"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McG&gt;''Indology, Indomania, and Orientalism'' by [[Douglas T. McGetchin]] (Jan 1, 2010) Fairleigh Dickinson University Press {{ISBN|083864208X}} page 133 "Faced with this cross-examination, Notovich confessed to fabricating his evidence."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejections of influence===
[[File:SVouet.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''The Crucifixion'' (1622) by [[Simon Vouet]]; Church of Jesus, [[Genoa]]. The [[crucifixion of Jesus]] is central to Christian belief.&lt;ref&gt;''New Testament Christology by Frank J. Matera 1999 {{ISBN|0-664-25694-5}} page 67&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
Most scholars believe there is no historical evidence of any influence by Buddhism on Christianity, [[Paula Fredriksen]] stating that no serious scholarly work has placed the [[origins of Christianity]] outside the backdrop of 1st century Palestinian Judaism.&lt;ref name=PaulaF26&gt;Fredriksen, Paula. ''From Jesus to Christ''. Yale University Press, 2000, p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=September 2016}} [[Leslie Houlden]] states that although modern parallels between the teachings of Jesus and Buddha have been drawn, these comparisons emerged after missionary contacts in the 19th century and there is no historically reliable evidence of contacts between Buddhism and Jesus.&lt;ref name=Les140&gt;''Jesus: The Complete Guide'' 2006 by Leslie Houlden {{ISBN|082648011X}} page 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars such as Eddy and Boyd state that there is no evidence of a historical influence by outside sources on the authors of the New Testament, and most scholars agree that any such historical influence on Christianity is entirely implausible given that first century [[monotheistic]] [[Galilean]] Jews would not have been open to what they would have seen as pagan stories.&lt;ref name=Eddy53&gt;''The Jesus legend: a case for the historical reliability of the synoptic gospels'' by Paul R. Eddy, Gregory A. Boyd 2007 {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} page 53-54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;[[Gerald O'Collins]], "The Hidden Story of Jesus" ''New Blackfriars'' Volume 89, Issue 1024, pages 710–714, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' states that theories of influences of Buddhism on early Christianity are without historical foundation.&lt;ref name=Buswell&gt;''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (Volume One) by Robert E. Buswell (Feb 2004) {{ISBN|0028657195}} Macmillan pages 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship has roundly rejected any historical basis for the travels of Jesus to India or Tibet or influences between the teachings of Christianity and Buddhism, and has seen the attempts at parallel symbolism as cases of [[parallelomania]] which exaggerate the importance of trifling resemblances.&lt;ref name=Les140/&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;[[Gerald O'Collins]], "The Hidden Story of Jesus" ''New Blackfriars'' Volume 89, Issue 1024, pages 710–714, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Voorst17&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E (2000). Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} page 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Borg303&gt;''The Historical Jesus in Recent Research'' edited by James D. G. Dunn and Scot McKnight 2006 {{ISBN|1-57506-100-7}} page 303&lt;/ref&gt;

There are inherent and fundamental differences between Buddhism and Christianity, one significant element being that while Christianity is at its core [[monotheistic]] and relies on a [[God in Christianity|god as a creator]], while Buddhism is generally [[non-theistic]] and rejects the notion of a Creator God which provides divine values for the world.&lt;ref name=Numrich10&gt;''The Boundaries of Knowledge in Buddhism, Christianity, and Science'' by Paul D Numrich (Dec 31, 2008) {{ISBN|3525569874}} page 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lim34&gt;''Communicating Christ in the Buddhist World'' by Paul De Neui and David Lim (Jan 1, 2006) {{ISBN|0878085106}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The central [[iconography|iconic imagery]] of the two traditions underscore the difference in their belief structure, when the peaceful death of [[Gautama Buddha]] at an old age is contrasted with the harsh image of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] as a willing sacrifice for the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement for the sins]] of humanity.&lt;ref name=Leslie140/&gt; Buddhist scholars such as [[Masao Abe]] see the centrality of crucifixion in Christianity as an irreconcilable gap between the two belief systems.&lt;ref name=Abe99&gt;''Buddhism and Interfaith Dialogue'' by [[Masao Abe]] and Steven Heine (Jun 1, 1995) pages 99-100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Suzuki113&gt;''Mysticism, Christian and Buddhist'' by Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki ((Aug 4, 2002)) {{ISBN|1605061328}} page 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 3rd–4th century Christian writers such as [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] and [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] write of one [[Scythianus]] who visited India around 50 CE, whence he brought the "doctrine of the Two Principles". Scythianus' pupil [[Terebinthus]] supposedly presented himself as a "Buddha" ("he called himself Buddas" [[Cyril of Jerusalem]]) and became well known in [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] and was said to have conversed with the apostles and to have brought books back from his trade with India. The same author says his books and knowledge were taken over by [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], and became the foundation of the [[Manicheism|Manichean doctrine]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Cyril of Jerusalem, Sixth Catechetical Lecture Chapter 22-24:
"22. There was in Egypt one Scythianus, a Saracen by birth, having nothing in common either with Judaism or with Christianity. This man, who dwelt at Alexandria and imitated the life of Aristotle, composed four books, one called a Gospel which had not the acts of Christ, but the mere name only, and one other called the book of Chapters, and a third of Mysteries, and a fourth, which they circulate now, the Treasure. This man had a disciple, Terebinthus by name. But when Scythianus purposed to come into Judaea, and make havoc of the land, the Lord smote him with a deadly disease, and stayed the pestilence.&lt;br&gt;
23. But Terebinthus, his disciple in this wicked error, inherited his money and books and heresy, and came to Palestine, and becoming known and condemned in Judaea he resolved to pass into Persia: but lest he should be recognised there also by his name he changed it and called himself Buddas. However, he found adversaries there also in the priests of Mithras: and being confuted in the discussion of many arguments and controversies, and at last hard pressed, he took refuge with a certain widow. Then having gone up on the housetop, and summoned the daemons of the air, whom the Manichees to this day invoke over their abominable ceremony of the fig, he was smitten of God, and cast down from the housetop, and expired: and so the second beast was cut off.&lt;br&gt;
24. The books, however, which were the records of his impiety, remained; and both these and his money the widow inherited. And having neither kinsman nor any other friend, she determined to buy with the money a boy named Cubricus: him she adopted and educated as a son in the learning of the Persians, and thus sharpened an evil weapon against mankind. So Cubricus, the vile slave, grew up in the midst of philosophers, and on the death of the widow inherited both the books and the money. Then, lest the name of slavery might be a reproach, instead of Cubricus he called himself Manes, which in the language of the Persians signifies discourse. For as he thought himself something of a disputant, he surnamed himself Manes, as it were an excellent master of discourse. But though he contrived for himself an honourable title according to the language of the Persians, yet the providence of God caused him to become a self-accuser even against his will, that through thinking to honour himself in Persia, he might proclaim himself among the Greeks by name a maniac." &lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia (Public Domain, quoted in [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310106.htm])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jerome|Saint Jerome]] (4th century CE) mentions that the Buddhist belief of Buddha's birth from a virgin as their "opinion [...] authoritatively handed down that Budda, the founder of their religion, had his birth through the side of a virgin,"&lt;ref&gt;Jerome-Against-Jovinianus, 815, Online Viewing: http://www.patriarchywebsite.com/bib-patriarchy/Jerome-Against-Jovinianus.txt&lt;/ref&gt; (the Buddha was, according to Buddhist tradition, born from the hip of his mother).&lt;ref&gt;Andre Grabar "Christian iconography, a study of its origins", p129&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this virgin birth legend of Buddhism influenced Christianity.&lt;ref name="McEvilley, p391"&gt;McEvilley, p391&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gnosticism===
{{main|Buddhism and Gnosticism}}
[[Image:Saint Irenaeus.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Irenaeus of Lyon]] first used the term "gnostic" in the 2nd century to describe heresies]]
[[Gnosticism]] comprised a number of small Christian sects which existed in the 2nd-5th centuries, and were rejected by mainstream Christians as [[heretics]]. There were some contacts between Gnostics and Indians, e.g. Syrian [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] theologian [[Bar Daisan]] describes in the 3rd century his exchanges with missions of holy men from India (Greek: Σαρμαναίοι, Sramanas), passing through [[Syria]] on their way to [[Elagabalus]] or another [[Severan dynasty]] [[Roman Emperor]]. His accounts are quoted by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (De abstin., iv, 17 {{ref|Porphyry}}) and [[Stobaeus]] (Eccles., iii, 56, 141).

This has given rise to suggestions by Zacharias P. Thundy that Buddhist tradition may have influenced Gnosticism and hence Christianity.&lt;ref name=Thundy&gt;{{cite book|author=Zacharias P. Thundy|title=Buddha and Christ: Nativity Stories and Indian Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1C1HPQW2QsgC|year=1993|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-09741-4|pages= 206-208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thundy has also considered possible influences through the Jewish sect [[Therapeutae]], which he suggests could have been Buddhists in the first century.&lt;ref name=Thundy-a&gt;''Buddha and Christ'' by Zacharias P. Thundy (Jan 1, 1993) {{ISBN|9004097414}} pages 244-245&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Gnosticism was harshly rejected by Christians and c. 180 [[Irenaeus]] wrote against them at length in his ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis]]'', generally called ''Against Heresies''.&lt;ref name=Magill&gt;''The Ancient World: Dictionary of World Biography (Vol 1) by Frank N. Magill (Mar 1, 1999) {{ISBN|1579580408}} page 597&lt;/ref&gt; By the third century non-Christian Indians were also considered heretics by the Christians who condemned their practices.&lt;ref name=Thundy/&gt;

[[Elaine Pagels]] has encouraged research into the impact of Buddhism on Gnosticism, but she holds that although intriguing, the evidence of any influence is inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Grau&gt;''Philosophers Explore The Matrix'' by Christopher Grau (Sep 1, 2005) {{ISBN|0195181069}} Oxford Univ Press page 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pagel/&gt; She further concludes that these parallels might be coincidental since parallel traditions may emerge in different cultures.&lt;ref name=Grau/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pagel&gt;{{cite book |first=Elaine |last=Pagels |title=The Gnostic Gospels |location=New York |publisher=Random House |origyear=1979|year=1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9839">The '''Cité Catholique''' is a [[Traditionalist Catholic]] organisation created in 1946 by [[Jean Ousset]], originally a follower of [[Charles Maurras]] (founder of the [[monarchist]] ''[[Action Française]]'' in 1899) and Jean Masson (1910–1965), not to be confused (as F.

==History==
An advance party of the Cité catholique arrived in Argentina in 1958, in the middle of the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62) and after the [[Revolución Libertadora|military]] deposed [[Juan Perón]] in 1955.&lt;ref name=Verbitsky&gt;[[Horacio Verbitsky]] in ''The Silence'', extract transl. in English made available by [[openDemocracy]]: [http://www.opendemocracy.net/content/articles/PDF/2709.pdf Breaking the silence: the Catholic Church in Argentina and the "dirty war"], July 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Cité Catholique brought to Argentina a doctrine of [[counter-revolutionary warfare]] and repression against terrorism, justified as part of [[Thomism|Thomist]] dogmatism.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} They would thus provide the [[ideological]] support of the future "[[Dirty War]]" carried out by the [[Argentine Armed Forces|Argentine military]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Verbitsky/&gt;

Many members of the group had taken part in the pro-"French Algeria" [[Organisation de l'Armée Secrète|OAS]] terrorist group created in Madrid, which attempted to block the implementation of the March 1962 [[Évian Accords]] and also tried several times to assassinate General [[Charles de Gaulle]], whom the French far-right felt had deceived them.&lt;ref name=Verbitsky/&gt; Following the dismantlement of the OAS and execution of some of its members, the OAS [[chaplain]], Fr. [[Georges Grasset]], organised the flight of OAS members, from a route going from Paris to [[Franquist Spain]] and finally to Argentina.&lt;ref name=Verbitsky/&gt; Grasset arrived in 1962 in Buenos Aires to take charge of the Argentine branch of the Cité Catholique.&lt;ref name=Verbitsky/&gt;

[[Charles Lacheroy]], a member of this group, was the first person to reflect on the reasons behind the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|1954 French defeat at Dien Bien Phu]], which all but put an end to the [[First Indochina War|Indochina War]] (1946–54). [[Roger Trinquier]], who theorised the systemic use of torture in counter-insurgency in ''Modern Warfare: A French View of Counterinsurgency'' (1961), was also a member of this organisation.&lt;ref name=Verbitsky/&gt; 

Along with Colonel [[Jean Gardes]], chief French expert in [[psychological warfare]], Jean Ousset developed the concept of "[[subversion (politics)|subversion]]".&lt;ref name=Verbitsky/&gt; According to Argentine journalist [[Horacio Verbitsky]], "this conceived a protean, quintessential enemy who, rather than being defined by his actions, was seen as a force trying to subvert Christian order, [[natural law]] or the Creator's plan." According to Ousset, "the revolutionary apparatus is ideological before it is political, and political before it is military.&lt;ref name=Verbitsky/&gt;"

==''Le Marxisme-Léninisme''==
In ''Le Marxisme-Léninisme'', Jean Ousset wrote that Marxists could only be combatted by "a profound faith, an unlimited obedience to the [[Pope|Holy Father]], and a thorough knowledge of the Church's doctrines."&lt;ref name=Verbitsky/&gt; The first translated version of this book was in Spanish, published in Argentina in 1961 and for which [[Antonio Caggiano]], Archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1959 to 1965, wrote a prologue, where he thanked the "men of ''La Ciudad Católica'' of Argentina."&lt;ref name=Verbitsky/&gt; In this prologue, Caggiano explained that Marxism was born of "the negation of Christ and his Church put into practice by the [[Revolution]]" and spoke of a Marxist conspiracy to take over the world, for which it was necessary to "prepare for the decisive battle," although the enemy had not yet "taken up arms."&lt;ref name=Verbitsky/&gt; The Argentine journalist [[Horacio Verbitsky]] commented this: "As often happens in a continent that imports ideas, the doctrine of annihilation preceded that of the revolutionary uprising." Caggiano compared this vigilance to the one that preceded the 1571 [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] "to save Europe from domination by the Turks."&lt;ref name=Verbitsky/&gt; Ousset's book also included a list of the [[papal bull]]s condemning communism.

Colonel Jean Gardes arrived in Argentina in 1963.&lt;ref name=Verbitsky/&gt; Her daughter showed in 2003 to French journalist [[Marie-Monique Robin]] notes from her father, which show that in March 1963, a naval lieutenant commander, [[Federico Lucas Roussillon]], offered Gardes Argentine government protection if he would deliver counter-insurgency courses at the [[Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics|ESMA]], the Navy Mechanic Schools.&lt;ref name=Robin&gt;[[Marie-Monique Robin]], ''Escadrons de la mort, l'école française'', 453 pages.

''[http://www.mefeedia.com/entry/2926696/ La Escuela Francesa, escuadrones de la muerte]'' (French, English, Spanish — Spanish subtitles), broadcast on [[Mefeedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, then Lieutenant Roussillon took part in the ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'', the Catholic nationalist movement led by [[Eduardo Lonardi]] which overthrew [[Juan Domingo Perón]]. Major Juan Francisco Guevara, one of Lonardi's general staff, proposed that the conspirational password be "God is Just." Roussillon became in 1963 a member of the [[Argentine Navy|Naval intelligence]] service, and retired in 1979 with the rank of Captain. Soon after Gardes met Roussillon, the Cadets at the ESMA were shown the film ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'', which described one of the first counter-insurgency battles, during which General [[Marcel Bigeard]] and [[Jacques Massu]] made a systemic use of [[Torture during the Algerian War|torture]], the [[block warden system]], and [[death flight]]s (dubbed "''Crevettes Bigeard''", or "Bigeard's Shrimps").&lt;ref name=Robin/&gt;

{{Criticism of religion sidebar}}
[[Sikhism]] has been criticized in one way or another by proponents of other theories. These critics include both Sikhs and non-Sikhs under different motives. These criticisms extend across a large portion of the beliefs and practices of Sikhism and even question the authenticity of the origin of the faith. As a result, Sikhs continue to face discrimination due to their presence and past activities.

==Theology==
Scholar [[W H McLeod|William Hewat McLeod]] cited the tension between the doctrine of God's [[Transcendence (religion)#Sikhism|transcendence]] in Sikhism and a supposed ability of God to communicate with people. McLeod says Sikh thinkers have been unable to give a convincing account of how God can communicate with people at all if this being is indeed transcendent.&lt;ref&gt;Mandair, A.-P. S., ''Religion and the Specter of the West'' ([[Columbia University Press]], 2009), p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Although, this is what makes Sikh teachings different from other schools of thought i.e., that God is transcendental, formless and infinite but still can communicate to people as if a physical being.

Hindu leader [[Dayanand Saraswati]], in his book ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]'', criticized [[Sikhism]], describing [[Guru Nanak]] as a "rogue",&lt;ref&gt;"Reduced to Ashes: The Insurgency and Human Rights in Punjab ..., Volume 1", p.16&lt;/ref&gt; the hymns of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] as falsehood, and Sikhism as a snare to rob and cheat simple folk of their wealth and property. A Sikh wrote a response, to which Dayanand Saraswati answered that his opinion had undergone a change when he visited [[Punjab]], and the remarks about Sikhism would be deleted in the subsequent edition of his work. However, these remarks were never removed after the untimely death of Dayanand Saraswati, and later editions of ''Satyarth Prakash'' were even more critical of Sikhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sikhinstitute.org/jan_2007/3-gansi.htm|title=Institute of Sikh Studies, Chandigarh|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious text===
[[File:Guru Granth Sahib Sikh scripture with Chauri on the left.jpg|thumb|Guru Granth Sahib being read.]]
[[Ernest Trumpp]] had concluded that [[Guru Granth Sahib|Adi Granth]] was not worth translating in full--"the same few ideas, he thought, being endlessly repeated," and referring to the heterogeneous language (mostly Sadhukkadi or Saint's tongue, a mixture of Indian dialects, used by saints to preach in North India)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guru Granth Sahib|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=esp. Kabir, Ravidas and most of Nanak's Shlokas}}&lt;/ref&gt; that consisted of various dialects, he described the text as "incoherent and shallow in the extreme, and couched at the same time in dark and perplexing language, in order to cover these defects. It is for us Occidentals a most painful and almost stupefying task, to read only a single Rag."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tony Ballantyne|title=Between Colonialism and Diaspora: Sikh Cultural Formations in an Imperial World|date=26 Jul 2006|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822388111|pages=52–3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Even for Sikhs the language of the Guru Granth Sahib is considered archaic and hard to understand without an interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S.

Regarding the [[Dasam Granth]], the second scripture of Sikhs written by the 10th [[Guru Gobind Singh]], there is much controversy among Sikh scholars regarding its authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robin Rinehart|title=Debating the Dasam Granth|date=5 Jan 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199842476|page=8}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

===Monotheism===
Sikhism defines the concept of one God as [[Ik Onkar|Ek Onkar]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/sikhismrev2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sikhs in Europe: Migration, Identities and Representations|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3v3t9bjPAcC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=sikhism+gurus+onkar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D3NXUu3LOMXUrQe6pICQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sikhism%20gurus%20onkar&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the concept of [[monotheism]] was already taught in the [[Vedas]],&lt;ref&gt;"Divine Message Of God To Mankind Vedas" by J.M.

Guru Nanak opposed [[polytheistic]] practices. According to a legend, Nanak during his trip to [[Mecca]] had debate with [[mullahs]] of Mecca, in his debate, Nanak had asserted that the [[Kaaba]] was only a black stone, which is [[Lingam]], of Lord [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham Cust|first=Robert|title=Linguistic and Oriental Essays|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_AIAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However it has been alleged that later gurus of Sikhism added the practices that can be linked with polytheism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruthi|first=Raj|title=Sikhism and Indian Civilization|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KxndvJs3wUkC&amp;pg=PA16}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably waving fans over Guru Granth Sahib during worship.&lt;ref&gt;"The Guru Granth Sahib and Sikhism", p. 28, by Anita Ganeri&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hindu Religion: Customs and Manners; Describing the Customs and Manners, Religious, Social and Domestic Life, Arts and Sciences of the Hindus", p. 78, by Paul Thomas&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhism also permits the veneration and [[Intercession of saints]] (such as to the Sikh martyr [http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Bhai_Maharaj_Singh%20Bhai Bhai Maharaj Singh]) and views its Gurus as the "embodiment of Divine Light" and "Divine in Spirit",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concept of Guru|url=http://searchsikhism.com/concept-of-guru|website=Search Sikhism|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are seen by some religious groups as forms of polytheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rajesh Rai|author2=Peter Reeves|title=The South Asian Diaspora: Transnational Networks and Changing Identities|date=25 Jul 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134105953|page=188}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kelly Pemberton|author2=Michael Nijhawan|title=Shared Idioms, Sacred Symbols, and the Articulation of Identities in South Asia|date=25 Oct 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135904777|pages=143, 161}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syncretism===
{{see also|Islam and Sikhism|Hinduism and Sikhism}}

One view of Sikhism is that it is a [[syncretism]] of Hinduism (particularly the [[Bhakti]] movement) and Islam (particularly [[Sufism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Propositional Religions 5 - Sikhism|url=http://www.biblestudying.net/mysticism5.html|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flawed Definitions of Sikhism|url=http://www.sikhcoalition.org/flawed-definitions-of-sikhism|website=THE SIKH COALITION|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Sikhs|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), having evolved from Hinduism in the context of a multiplicity of syncretic movements in [[Medieval India]], while taking the idea of monotheism from Islam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Griffin|authorlink1=Roger Griffin|title=Terrorist's Creed: Fanatical Violence and the Human Need for Meaning|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137284723|edition=illustrated|quote=By hybridizing Hinduism - particularly elements of Vaishnavism with its stress on active devotion ('bhakti') - with Islam - especially its monotheism and Sufi mystic tradition - a new monotheistic religion was born...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shashi Tharoor|title=[[India: From Midnight to the Millennium]]|date=2006|publisher=Arcade Publishing|isbn=9781559708036|page=368|edition=reprint, revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John McCannon|title=AP World History, 6th ed.|date=2014|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=9781438092669|quote=While many consider Sikhism to have emerged as an independent tradition, it is categorized by others as a syncretic faith, joining certain aspects of Hindu theology with the monotheism associated with Islam.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Holm|editor1-first=Jean|editor2-last=Bowker|editor2-first=John|title=Picturing God|date=1994|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781441120311|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the incorporation of selected hymns from Hindu and Muslim saints (such as [[Kabir]], [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar]] and other [[Bhagat]]) into the [[Guru Granth Sahib]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This view was commonly believed, but is outdated within scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Dhanjal, B., "Sikhism" in Holm &amp; Bowker (eds.), ''Picturing God'' ([[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]], 1994), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Harjot Oberoi]], until the 19th century the Sikhs had shown "little collective interest in distinguishing themselves from the Hindus" and "Sikh notions of time, space, corporality, holiness, kinship, social distinctions, purity and pollution and commensality were hardly different from those of the Hindus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Girja Kumar|title=The Book on Trial: Fundamentalism and Censorship in India|date=1 Jan 1997|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|isbn=9788124105252|page=385}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikh belief in [[Reincarnation]] is also often used as proof of the syncretic influence of Hinduism on Sikhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q: What happens after death?|url=http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1248308791&amp;ucat=7|website=RealSikhism|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Douglas A.

===Ethnoreligious group===

The tenth Guru was an avid hunter, noting in his autobiography his success in killing antelope, elk, bears, and lions.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  He is often portrayed with his hunting hawk and hunting dogs, and regarded as a huntsman.

==In academia==
Sikh groups have put pressure on universities, and there has been a movement among some Sikhs to stifle academic criticism of Sikhism in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Hawley &amp; Mann, "Introduction" in ''Studying the Sikhs'' ([[SUNY Press]], 1993), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with other religions and communities==
[[File:Jacques Chirac.jpg|thumb|right|125px|A ban on [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|religious symbols]] that included Sikh signs was introduced in France under the presidency of [[Jacques Chirac]].]]
There is a history of tension between Sikhism and Islam. This goes back to the persecution of Sikhs by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors in India, but has manifested in more recent distrust between the communities in the UK, including hostility to inter-community romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hundal|first=Sunny|title=Sikhs v Muslims: why the debate on grooming isn’t about the women themselves|url=http://liberalconspiracy.org/2013/09/12/sikhs-v-muslims-why-the-debate-on-grooming-isnt-about-the-women-themselves/|work=Liberal Conspiracy|accessdate=9 October 2013|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1947 [[Partition of India]] promises of a Sikh majority state were outlined, however following the divide of India and the creation of Pakistan, renegation on such promises was the approach taken by the Indian government of the time. Following this, the actions occurring in [[Operation Blue Star]] which were seen as atrocities by Sikhs, led to worldwide protests and renewed demands for a separate nation as was previously promised, they called it "[[Khalistan movement]]", during this movement, some Sikhs had been involved in retaliatory-terrorism, the most well-known incident being [[Air India Flight 182]], in which 268 Canadian citizens died. Many of the Sikh groups were [[Khalistan movement#Khalistan militant outfits|banned]] from the numerous countries, who had been convicted with terrorist activities. Due to such negative impact, the support for [[Khalistan Movement]] has been commonly regarded as act of terrorism, many have been arrested for affirming support for the movement.&lt;ref&gt;"Congressional Record, V. 152, PT. 17, November 9, 2006 to December 6, 2006", p. 606&lt;/ref&gt;

The present situation in Punjab is usually regarded as a cautionary tension with elements of peace; and the militant movement (Khalistan) has been weakened.

In 2004, [[France]] had passed the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]], which banned many religious signs in schools. This ban most notably included [[Dastar|turbans]], a religious garment and central characteristic of Sikh religious code and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16547479|title=UN human rights body backs French Sikhs on turbans|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the number of Sikhs in France is a small minority, the French education minister claimed ignorance of the consequences such an act would have for the Sikh population residing in France. This law led to Sikhs protesting against the law across [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3448239.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Sikhs protest against French ban|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-16/india/37132455_1_french-turban-ban-sikh-children-ban-on-religious-symbols|title=India News, Latest Sports, Bollywood, World, Business &amp; Politics News - Times of India|work=The Times of India|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other regions. This issue is heatedly debated as exploitation of secularism appears to infringe on the universal right and principal - freedom of expression. [[European Court of Human Rights]] dismissed the petition. Although [[United Nations|UN]]'s human right body supported the petition in January 2012, citing that turbans do not pose a threat to ground security.

In [[Canada]], a 2013 poll concluded that 39% of Canadians had a negative view of Sikhism, second after [[Islam]], which was negatively viewed by 54%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angusreidglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Canadians-view-non-Christian-religions-with-uncertainty-dislike.pdf Canadian Public Opinion Poll], 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mikvé Israel-Emanuel Synagogue''' ({{lang-he|'''בית הכנסת מקווה ישראל-עמנואל'''}}; {{lang-en|'''The Hope of Israel-Emanuel Synagogue'''}}), in [[Willemstad, Curaçao]], is the [[Oldest synagogues in the world#South America and Caribbean|oldest surviving synagogue]] in the Americas. It is commonly known as the ''Snoa'' (short for [[esnoga]], an old Portuguese and Ladino word for [[synagogue]]) and is a major tourist attraction in Curaçao, with one notable group of visitors including [[Queen Beatrix]] of the Netherlands and her family, in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=106837 |title=Dwindling Community of Curacao Maintains Oldest Synagogue in West |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106225008/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=106837 |archivedate=2014-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community (congregation ''Mikvé Israel'') dates from the 1650s, and consisted of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] from the Netherlands and Brazil. In the nineteenth century there was a breakaway [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] community (Emanu El); the two merged to form the present community in 1964. The community is now affiliated with [[Reconstructionist Judaism]].

The first synagogue building was purchased in 1674; the current building dates from 1730.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Curacao.html|title=Curacao Virtual Jewish History Tour|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One visitor to the synagogue observed, upon entering through a quiet courtyard, viewing the azure stained glass windows and walking across a sand covered floor toward the carved mahogany Holy Ark that the sand floors remind congregants "of how its Jewish ancestors on the Iberian peninsula covered the floors of their makeshift prayer houses so that their footsteps would be muffled and the suspicion of potential denouncers would not be aroused."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Curacao1.html | title=A Journey to Jewish Curaçao}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its three high vaulted ceilings, the Holy Ark and the pulpit, the galleries, the benches and the chandeliers, the interior of the synagogue bears a marked resemblance to the [[Portuguese Synagogue]] in [[Amsterdam]]. Attached to the synagogue is the Jewish Historical Cultural Museum, whose collection includes replicas of artistic tombstones from the '''Beit Chaim Bleinheim''' in Curaçao, the oldest Jewish cemetery still in use in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snoa.com |publisher=Synagogue Mikvé Israel-Emanuel | title=Welcome to Mikvé Israel-Emanuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] island in the Caribbean with a historical synagogue is [[Sint Eustatius]], where the ruins of the '''Honen Dalim synagogue''' of 1739 still stand impressively on the 'Synagoge Pad'. An even older synagogue existed at [[Jodensavanne]], [[Suriname]], ''Beracha ve Shalom'' ("Blessings and Peace"), built between 1665 and 1671. Unlike the Curaçao synagogue, however, these other synagogues are no longer in use.

'''Dakshinapatha''' is a historical region including:

*the "Ancient South of the [[Indian subcontinent]]" below [[Uttarapatha]]. The term can encompass [[South India|Dravida]], [[Sri Lanka|Simhala]], the [[Lakshadweep|Kollam]] region, and the [[Maldives]].In the south region? 
* the "great southern highway" in India, traveling from [[Magadha]] to [[Pratishthana]],&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|author=Singh, U.|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9788131711200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC|page=289|accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
* a kingdom on the [[Godavari River]] in southern India&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historytoday.com/historical-dictionary/d/dakshinapatha&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="palikanon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/d/dakkhinaapatha.htm|title=Dakkhināpatha|publisher=palikanon.com|accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dakshinapatha trade route was one of two great highways that have connected different parts of the sub-continent since the [[Iron Age in India|Iron Age]]. The other highway was the [[Uttarapatha]] or the great northern road that ran from Taxila in Afganisthan, through the modern Punjab up to the western coast of Yamuna. Following the course of Yamuna it went southwards up to Mathura, from there it passed on to Ujjain in Malwa and to Broach on western coast. According to "Land of the Seven Rivers: A Brief History of India's Geography" by [[Sanjeev Sanyal]], the trajectory of the northern road has remained roughly the same from pre-Mauryan times and is now NH2.{{cn|date=May 2017}} However, the southern road appears to have drifted. Rama's route into exile in the epic may have been an early version of the road, but by the time of Buddha it started at Varanasi and ran through Vidisha in central India, to Pratishthana (Paithan).{{cn|date=May 2017}} It probably extended all the way to Chola, Chera and Pandya kingdoms of the extreme south. By the Mauryan period there would have been a branch from Ujjain to the ports of Gujarat. This made Ujjain a major city by Gupta times. Today Dakshinapatha is known as NH7, which runs much further east of the old road but still meets NH2 at Varanasi.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

'''David Harold Chilton''' (1951–1997) was an American [[reformed]] [[pastor]], [[Christian reconstructionist]], speaker, and author of several books on [[economics]], [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] and Christian Worldview from Placerville, California.  He contributed three books on eschatology: ''Paradise Restored'' (1985), ''The Days of Vengeance'' (1987), and ''The Great Tribulation'' (1987).

His book ''Productive Christians in an Age of Guilt-Manipulators: A Biblical Response to Ronald J. Sider'' (1981) was a response to Ronald J. Sider's best-selling book, ''Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger: A Biblical Study'' (1977), which promoted various programs of wealth redistribution by the government. Chilton argued that the Bible either does not authorize such programs or explicitly teaches against them.

His book ''Power in the Blood: A Christian Response to AIDS'' (1987) was primarily dealing with the Church's relationship with the world.

==Early years==

David Chilton was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1951. At the age of one, he moved with his Christian missionary parents to the Philippines. At the age of 8, the family returned to the United States where his father became a pastor in Southern California. Growing up in California in the 1970s youth movement and [[hippie]] culture, he experienced a conversion to Christianity while listening to a missionary speak at his father's church. He began reading the Bible and teaching Bible studies. The young Chilton consequently became deeply involved in the nascent [[Jesus People]] movement, and started a singing group with his sister Jayn and some friends called [[The Children of Light]]. He frequently spoke, performed music, and taught Bible studies at Christian coffeehouses in Los Angeles, California region. He was ordained in the Jesus People Movement by Pat Boone.

Chilton came to prominence as a writer for the [[Chalcedon Report]] edited by [[R.J. Rushdoony]] after a Christian friend recommended one of Rushdoony's books. At the same time, Chilton discovered the writings of the [[Puritans]], and was exposed for the first time to [[Reformed theology]] as a result of reading these books, and to the doctrines of predestination, election, and perseverance of the saints. After meeting Rushdoony, Chilton was asked to write a monthly column for Chalcedon Report while alternating speaking for Dr. Rushdoony at his church in Hollywood (which was affiliated with the [[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]]) while pastoring a church in Anaheim, California. At this time Chilton was also influenced by fellow Christian Reconstructionists [[Greg Bahnsen]] and [[James B. Jordan]]. He married his wife, Darlene, and had 3 children, Nathan, Jacob, and Abigail.

In 1981, after several years of pastoring in Anaheim, Chilton wrote his first book, ''Productive Christians in an Age of Guilt-Manipulators: A Biblical Response to Ronald J. Sider'' over the course of a month with a pencil and paper at a coffeehouse. Not long after the completion of the book, he moved to Placerville, CA to pastor a church for a year, during which he wrote a newsletter for Christian teachers and [[homeschoolers]] called [[The Biblical Educator]]. Chilton also used his influence to help launch [[World Magazine]] with [[Joel Belz]] and wrote a monthly column for the publication for years, which was very popular.

Although Chilton loved the people of Placerville and did not want to leave, he accepted a job offer from prominent Reconstructionist (and Rushdoony son-in-law) [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]] as a research assistant at [[The Institute for Christian Economics]] in [[Tyler, Texas]]. It was during his three-year stay in Texas that North commissioned Chilton to write his two books for North's imprint Dominion Press: Paradise Restored and Days of Vengeance.

==Later years==

In 1986 Chilton accepted an offer to return to Placerville to pastor the church there. He continued to work in pastoral ministry, speak at conferences, write a weekly column for [[The Sacramento Union]] newspaper, was counsel for [[The Fieldstead Co.]] at an economic conference in Switzerland and wrote his last two books, The Great Tribulation and Power in the Blood.

Whitefield Theological Seminary awarded him with 2 degrees:  The Master of Divinity in the field of Pastoral Theology in 1990 and the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the field of Christian Thought in 1992, primarily for his work on Days of Vengeance.

==Death==

In 1994, Chilton suffered a massive heart attack and went into a six-week coma. He slowly began to recover, though he had difficulty speaking. During this time, he wrote a monthly column on the family for [[Ligonier Ministries]]. He took his second speaking trip to Australia for a month of engagements and also spoke at a church in The Bahamas.

In 1997, Chilton suffered his second heart attack and died at the age of 45 years.

'''Deir El Aachayer''' ({{lang-ar|ديرالعشاير}}) is a village north of [[Rashaya]], in the [[Rashaya District]] and south of the [[Beqaa Governorate]] in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-1164909&amp;fid=3678&amp;c=lebanon Geographic.org - Entry about Deir El Aachayer from data supplied by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Bethesda, MD, USA  a member of the Intelligence community of the United States of America]&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipality is located on the border frontier of the Kaza of Rashaya, one of eight [[mohafazat]]s (governorates). It sits at a height of {{convert|1250|m|ft}} above sea level and its surface area covers {{convert|2563|ha|mi2}} hectares. The registered population of the village is around 500, predominantly [[Druze]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishdruze.org.uk/popups/detailed_druzes.html British Druze Society - Druze communities in the Middle East] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911063025/http://www.britishdruze.org.uk/popups/detailed_druzes.html |date=September 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual residents may number only around 250, distributed among about 90 households. The village has a municipal council made up of nine members, and a town mayor. Residents rely on farming as a main source of income, especially [[grapes]], [[fruit]] and [[wheat]]. Residents also raise and herd [[sheep]] and [[cows]], which have been a good source of [[milk]]. Farmers in the village have had difficulty selling their products in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localiban.org/spip.php?article3484 Localiban Entry about Deir El Aachayer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Deir El Aachayer has a number of local springs, including ''Ain Halalweh'', ''Ain Shayeb'', ''Ain Rouk'', ''Ain Dibb''. The village was once known by the name ''Deir Mar Sema’an'', owing to the Monastery of Saint [[Simonianism|Simon]], known locally as ''Al Borj'', said to have been built by the Romans for preaching, religious ceremonies and practices by disciples of Saint Simon the Baptist. The monastery having been a stronghold for the students, enabling them to expand their teaching in [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tourism.leb961.com/brochures/rachaya.pdf Qada' (Caza) Rachaya - Promenade Tourist Brochure, published by The Lebanese Ministry of Tourism - Entry about Deir El Achayer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713193822/http://tourism.leb961.com/brochures/rachaya.pdf |date=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Fudoki'''''|風土記|}} are ancient reports on [[provinces of Japan|provincial]] culture, geography, and [[oral tradition]] presented to the reigning [[Emperor of Japan|monarchs of Japan]], also known as local [[gazetteers]]. They contain agricultural, geographical, and historical records as well as [[Japanese mythology|mythology]] and [[Japanese folklore|folklore]].{{Sfn|Sakamoto|2011|pp=16-17}} ''Fudoki'' manuscripts also document local myths, rituals, and [[Waka (poetry)|poems]] that are not mentioned in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' chronicles, which are the most important literature of the ancient national mythology and history. In the course of national unification, the imperial court enacted a series of criminal and administrative codes called ''[[ritsuryō]]'' and surveyed the provinces established by such codes to exert greater control over them.{{Sfn|Sakamoto|2011|pp=4-5}}

== Kofudoki ==
[[Image:Harima Fudoki.jpg|thumb|250px|A scroll of the oldest extant Fudoki from [[Harima Province]]  preserved at [[Tenri Central Library]] in [[Tenri, Nara]]]]
In the narrower sense, ''Fudoki'' refer to the oldest records written in the [[Nara period]], later called {{nihongo|'''''Kofudoki'''''|古風土記}} (Old-Fudoki). Compilation of ''Kofudoki'' began in 713 and was completed over a 20-year period.{{Sfn|Sakamoto|2011|pp=16-17}} Following the [[Taika Reform]] in 646 and the [[Code of Taihō]] enacted in 701, there was need to centralize and solidify the power of the imperial court. This included accounting for lands under its control. According to the ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'', [[Empress Genmei]] issued a decree in 713 ordering each {{nihongo|provincial government|[[:ja:国衙]]|kokuga}} to collect and report the following information:{{Sfn|Sakamoto|2011|pp=16-17}}{{Sfn|Kojima|Naoki|Nishimiya|Kuranaka|2007|pp=310-311}}
*Names of [[districts of Japan|districts]] and townships
*Natural resources and living things
*Land fertility
*Etymology of [[Japanese place name#Geographic features|names for geographic features]], such as mountains, plains, and rivers 
*Myths, legends, and folktales told orally by old people

==Names==

[[Empress Genmei]] ordered in 713 that [[Japanese place names|place names]] in the provinces, districts, and townships should be written in two [[kanji]] characters with positive connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://crd.ndl.go.jp/reference/modules/d3ndlcrdentry/index.php?page=ref_view&amp;id=1000151739 | title= 好字令 (good names) | publisher=National Diet Library | work=Collaborative Reference Database | accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Sakamoto|2011|pp=16-17}} This occasionally required name changes. For example, {{nihongo|Hayatsuhime|速津媛|}} became {{nihongo|Hayami|速見|}} and {{nihongo|Ishinashi no Oki|無石堡|}} became {{nihongo|Ishii|石井|}}.

==Manuscripts==

At least 48 of the [[Gokishichidō]] provinces contributed to their records but only that of [[Izumo Province|Izumo]] remains nearly complete. Partial records of [[Hizen Province|Hizen]], [[Bungo Province|Bungo]], [[Harima Province|Harima]] and [[Hitachi Province|Hitachi]] remain and a few passages from various volumes remain scattered throughout various books.{{Sfn|Sakamoto|2011|pp=16-17}} Those of Harima and Hizen are designated [[List of National Treasures of Japan (writings: Japanese books)#History books and historical tales|National Treasures]].

Below is a list of extant manuscripts and scattered passages.{{Sfn|Sakamoto|2011|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage2.nifty.com/toka3aki/geography/fudoki_itsu.html 国土としての始原史～風土記逸文] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130104042845/http://homepage2.nifty.com/toka3aki/geography/fudoki_itsu.html |date=2013-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parks==

In 1966 the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs (Japan)|Agency for Cultural Affairs]] called on the prefectural governments to build [[open-air museums]] and parks called {{Nihongo|Fudoki no Oka|風土記の丘|"Fudoki Hills"}} near historic sites such as tombs (''[[kofun]]'') and [[provincial temple]]s.{{Sfn|Sakamoto|2011}} These archaeological museums preserve and exhibit cultural properties to enhance public understanding of provincial history and culture.

The '''Hari-namamrta-vyakarana''' is a [[Sanskrit]] [[grammar]] composed by [[Jiva Goswami]]
in which all the technical terms in the sutras are names of [[Krishna]] or his associates.

Sri Jiva's inspiration for composing this book originated in Sri [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]'s explanation of grammar in terms of [[Krishna]]'s holy names, when he was a [[pandit]] in [[Nabadwip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dasa Thakura|first=Vrindavana|title=Chaitanya Bhagavata, Madhya Khanda, chapter 1|url=http://nitaaiveda.com/Compiled_and_Imp_Scriptures/Chaitanya_Bhagavata/Chaitanya_Bhagavata_Translation/Madhya_Khanda/1..htm|work=NItaaiveda|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This grammar was composed in two parts:Laghu-hari-namamrta-vyakarnana and Brhad-hari-namamrta-vyakarnana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prabhupada|first=A C Bhaktivedanta Swami|title=Introduction, Srimad Bhagavatam|url=http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_Introduction?terms=Hari-n%C4%81m%C4%81m%E1%B9%9Bta-vy%C4%81kara%E1%B9%87a&amp;first=In%20this%20school%20He%20would%20simply%20explain%20K%E1%B9%9B%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%87a,%20even%20in&amp;last=with%20the%20scholar,%20for%20Nim%C4%81i%20Pa%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Dita%20was%20only%20a%20boy.|work=Vanisource|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shorter version of the texts, known as Samksepa-Hari-namamrta-Vyakarana, ascribed to either Sri Jiva or Sri [[Sanatana Goswami]] is also extant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goswami|first=Jiva/Sanatana|title=Samkshepa-hari-namamrta-vyakarana|url=http://www.granthamandira.com/index.php?show=entry&amp;e_no=496|work=Gaudiya Grantha Mandira|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chapters==
The Hari-Namamrta Vyakarana consists of seven chapters, or ''prakaranas''.The ''prakaranas'' of the book are given below.
*Samjna-Sandhi Prakarana
*Vishnupada Prakarana: this chapter deals with declension of nouns

*Karaka Prakarana: This chapter deals with cases(nominative, etc.)
*Kridanta Prakarana: This chapter deals with suffixes of Sanskrit nouns, which can change the meaning of the word

But in ''Hari-nämämåta-vyäkaraëa'' the ''varëa-krama'' is traced back to Lord Näräyaëa, who is glorified throughout the Vedic literature as the Supreme Lord.  ----[[# msoanchor 1|[BE1]]]Between this heading and the first sutra there is a note in course about the format of translation and order of commentaries etc.
'''''Saàçodhiné—'''''The Sanskrit word ''varëa'' is most literally translated as a phoneme, or speech-sound. To translate the word ''varëa'' as a letter is erroneous, because a letter is defined as a written or printed symbol employed to represent a speech-sound. The phonemes, having arisen from Näräyaëa, are eternal whereas the letters used to represent them may vary. For example, before the introduction of printing into India in the eighteenth century, the script in which Sanskrit was written and taught varied from place to place and was the same, or almost the same as that used in writing the local vernacular language. The dissemination of printed Sanskrit texts, however, encouraged the predominance of one form of writing, the Devanägaré script of central India in which the modern languages Hindé and Maräöhé are also written. Today most Sanskrit publications are printed in this [null script][[# msocom 1|[BE1]]] .

'''Explanation of ''varëa-krama:'''''

According to MW, ''varëa-krama'' means “order or series of letters, alphabetical arrangement, alphabet.”

''Amåta'' explains ''varëa-krama'' as ''varëänäà kramaù kramaço nirgamanam'' (“the issuing forth sequentially by the ''varëas''[[# ftn1|[1]]][[# msocom 2|[MA2]]] ”).

''Bäla'' offers the following explanation: ''varëäni udbhütäni tat-kramaç ca udbhüta ity arthaù'' (“Both the ''varëas'' and their order appeared from Näräyaëa”).
----[[# ftnref1|[1]]] ''Amåta'' further explains that the word ''krama'' is formed by applying the ''kåt pratyaya'' ''[gh]a[ë]'' after the ''dhätu'' ''kram[u]'' ''päda-vikñepe'' (1P or 4P, “to step, walk”) in ''bhäve prayoga.'' Thus the word ''varëänäm'' is not ''sambandha-ñañöhé'' here, rather it is the ''anukta-kartä'' taking ''ñañöhé'' by ''kartå-karmaëoù ñañöhé kåd-yoge'' (). All of this will become clear in the ''Käraka-prakaraëa.''
----[[# msoanchor 1|[BE1]]]This samsodhini has one more sentence in course: " The sounds (''varëas'') of the Sanskrit alphabet are enumerated below in both Devanägaré script and roman transliteration."

----[[# ftnref1|[1]]] The ''våttis'' (“fundamental explanations of the ''sütras''”) were also written by Jéva Gosvämé. In the ''våttis,'' Jéva Gosvämé clarifies the ''sütra,'' gives examples, supplies extra information, and mentions the opinions of other grammarians. The ''Dhätu-saìgraha'' (“list of ''dhätus''”) was also composed by Jéva Gosvämé''.'' The ''Avyaya-çabda-saìgraha'' (“list of ''avyayas''”), however, is an anonymous appendix, probably composed by Purédäsa, found only in some of the printed editions of the ''Hari-nämämåta,'' and the ''Gaëa-päöha'' (“list of ''gaëas''”) belongs to Päëini. 
----[[# msoanchor 1|[MA1]]]Put a sentence like refer to the BBT pronunciation guide ..

'''''Saàçodhiné—'''''It will be explained in ''sütra'' 17 that all the ''varëas'' from ''ka'' to ''ha,'' the consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet, are dependent on the vowels for their pronunciation. That is to say, it is impossible to pronounce a consonant without the aid of a vowel. For this reason all the ''varëas'' from ''ka'' to ''ha'' are listed with an inherent ''a.'' But actually these ''varëas'' refer to the consonants themselves, regardless of the adjacent vowel. Thus the ''varëa'' ''ka'' refers to ''k,'' the ''varëa kha'' to ''kh,'' and so on. One should not be confused by the various labels such as “the ''varëa ka,''” ''ka-räma, ka-kära,'' and ''k;'' they all refer to the same consonant ''k,'' never to ''k+a.'' This is the case for all the ''varëas'' from ''ka'' to ''ha.'' One should also be careful not to mistake ''kh, gh, ch,'' and so on, to be a combination of ''k+h, g+h, c+h,'' and so on, because in roman transliteration the ''h'' in ''kh'' and so on is employed merely to indicate that the ''varëa'' is an aspirated consonant. It is impossible for ''kh'' and so on to be conjunct consonants since in Sanskrit there are no conjunct consonants that have ''h'' as their second member.

The ''varëas'' from ''a'' to ''au,'' the vowels of the Sanskrit alphabet, are written differently when they come after a consonant. ''A,'' however, has no post-consonantal symbol and is assumed to come after every consonant unless there is another vowel or a ''viräma'' in its place. The post consonantal forms of the vowels are shown below with the consonant ''k'' to indicate their proper placement.

k( ''ka,'' k(A ''kä,'' ik( ''ki,'' k(L ''ké,'' ku( ''ku,'' kU( ''kü,'' k{( ''kå,'' k|( ''kè,'' k}( ''kÿ,'' k}{ ''k ÿ‾,'' ke( ''ke,'' kE( ''kai,'' k(Ae ''ko,'' k(AE ''kau.''

 In the following special cases the post consonantal symbols of ''u, ü,'' and ''å'' are put in different places:

 ç&amp; ''ru,'' è&amp; ''rü,'' [null ä{"] [[# msocom 1|[MAD1]]] ''då,'' ô$ ''hå.''

The ''viräma'' ( ''',''') is a small oblique stroke, placed at the foot of a consonant, that is used to signal the deletion of its inherent ''a''. Thus ''ak'' would be written in Devanägaré as @k,(. The symbol called ''avagraha'' (') and the various conjunct consonants will be explained in ''Saàçodhiné'' 67 and ''Saàçodhiné'' 82 respectively. Extra symbols are also employed in the Devanägaré script for the purpose of basic punctuation. For example, the sign '''/''' is used at the end of a half-verse or sentence, and the sign '''//''' at the end of a verse or paragraph. The numbers of the Devanägaré script are as follows:

'''''Pratyähära-sütras'''''

Generally the alternate monosyllabic names found in the ''våttis'' of the ''Saàjïä-sandhi-prakaraëa,'' like the name ''al'' here, should be assumed to be ''pratyähäras'' from Päëini's ''Añöädhyäyé.'' Where this is not the case, we will list the source of the name separately. ''Pratyähära'' literally means “withdrawal.” In grammar, however, the term ''pratyähära'' refers to the abbreviation of a series of ''varëas'' into one syllable by combining the first member with the indicatory letter of the last member. It is said that Lord Çiva revealed the following 14 ''pratyähära-sütras'' (often called the ''Maheçvara-sütras'' or ''Çiva-sütras'') unto the sage Päëini, author of the famous ''Añöädhyäyé'' (literally, “a collection of eight chapters”), by sounding his ''òamaru'' drum. All the ''pratyähäras'' like ''al'' are formed by means of these ''sütras:''

'''1.''' ''a i u[ë];''  '''2.''' ''å ÿ[k];''  '''3.''' ''e o[ì];''  '''4.''' ''ai au[c];''  '''5.''' ''ha ya va ra[ö];''  '''6.''' ''la[ë];''  '''7.''' ''ïa ma ìa ëa na[m];''  '''8.''' ''jha bha[ï];''  '''9.''' ''gha òha dha[ñ];''  '''10.''' ''ja ba ga òa da[ç];''  '''11.''' ''kha pha cha öha tha ca öa ta[v];''  '''12.''' ''ka pa[y];''  '''13.''' ''ça ña sa[r];''  '''14.''' ''ha[l].''

In these ''pratyähära-sütras'' the letters in brackets are indicatory letters, not to be counted among the group of ''varëas'' indicated by the ''pratyähära''. And ''a, i , u, å,'' and ''ÿ'' in the first two ''sütras'' stand for both the long and short forms of those vowels--''a'' and ''ä, i'' and ''é, u'' and ''ü, å'' and ''è,'' and ''ÿ'' and ''ÿ‾'' respectively. The ''pratyähära'' ''al'' therefore indicates the group of ''varëas'' beginning from ''a'' in the first ''pratyähära-sütra'' and ending with ''ha,'' which has the indicatory letter ''l,'' in the fourteenth ''pratyähära-sütra.'' Thus the ''pratyähära'' ''al'' indicates the whole alphabet. Similarly The ''pratyähära'' ''ac'' indicates the group of ''varëas'' beginning from ''a'' in the first ''pratyähära-sütra'' and ending with ''au,'' which has the indicatory letter ''c,'' in the fourth ''pratyähära-sütra.'' Thus the ''pratyähära'' ''ac'' indicates all the vowels''.'' Other ''pratyähäras'' are made in the same way. In these ''sütras'' both ''ha'' and the indicatory letter ''ë'' appears twice. Although this may seem to cause problems, they are resolved as follows: The ''pratyähära aë'' is conventionally understood to be formed with the indicatory ''ë'' in the first ''sütra,'' while the ''pratyähära ië'' is conventionally understood to be formed with the indicatory letter ''ë'' in the sixth ''sütra.'' It was necessary to repeat ''ha'' twice in these ''sütras'' so that it could be included in such ''pratyähäras'' as ''haç'' and ''ië,'' and at the same time be included in ''pratyähäras'' like ''val, jhal,'' and ''çal.'' In ''pratyähäras'' like ''al'' and ''hal'' where ''ha'' appears twice it should not be taken as two separate ''varëas.''[[# ftn1|[1]]]

'''Alternate readings of the ''varëa-krama:'''''

 In the Haridäsa edition the ''viñëucäpa'' is included in the alphabet as coming after the ''viñëucakra,'' but this is unfounded as both commentaries don’t include it and its place of pronunciation is given only later in ''våtti'' 15. If it were meant to be included here in the alphabet its place of pronunciation should have been given here in this ''våtti'' as was done for all the other members of the alphabet.

In the Haridäsa, Purédäsa, and Caitanya Maöha editions, which are all based on ''Bäla,'' ''kña'' is included as the final member of the alphabet. But in the Kåñëadäsa edition, which is based on ''Amåta,'' ''kña'' is not to be found. Indeed, its absence is confirmed by the following excerpts from the ''Amåta'' commentary on this ''sütra:'' ''a-rämädi-ha-rämänto varëa-kramaù'' (“the alphabet beginning with ''a'' and ending with ''ha''”) and ''varëänäm ekona-païcäçat-prakäratvaà darçitaà'' (“the alphabet is shown as being 49- fold”). Furthermore, ''kña'' is generally not included in the alphabets listed in other Sanskrit Grammars [null also][[# msocom 1|[BE1]]] .

 On the other hand, Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains in his book ''Manträrtha-dépikä'' that ''Harinämämåta-vyäkaraëa'' lists fifty ''varëas'' in total and that the ''Rädha-kåñëa-sahasra-näma-stotra'' of Båhan-Näradéya Puräëa mentions ''païcäçad-varëa-rüpiëé'' (“she who is the embodiment of the fifty ''varëas''”) as one of the names of Çrématé Rädhäräëé. Similarly, even though ''Bäla'' also says ''a-rämädi-ha-rämänto varëa-kramaù'' (“the alphabet beginning with ''a'' and ending with ''ha''”), it contains an extra phrase: ''atra ka-ña-saàyoge kña iti vakñyamäëatve ’pi kña-rämaç ca darçitaù'' (“Although it will be explained in ''våtti'' 17 that ''kña'' is the combination of the consonants ''ka'' and ''ña, kña'' is also shown here”). The ultimate deciding point, however, is that Jéva Gosvämé does list ''kña'' in the alphabet when he elaborates upon the ''varëas'' in his ''Krama-sandarbha'' commentary for ''Bhägavatam'' 11.12.17 (see Appendix II). Furthermore, Jéva Gosvämé also uses the word ''kña-rämasya'' in ''sütra'' 283 which indicates beyond a doubt that ''kña'' is considered an additional ''varëa'' because according to ''sütra'' 37 the word ''räma'' could not be added to it as we understand from ''sütra'' 37 that the word ''räma'' is only used to refer to a ''varëa.'' Even though ''kña'' is accepted as a ''varëa'' in this way, it is not counted as a ''viñëujana'' because, in ''våtti'' 17, Jéva Gosvämé clearly says ''ka-kärädayo ha-käräntä varëä viñëujana-nämäno bhavanti [null ...]''[[# msocom 2|[MAD2]]]  ''ka-ña-saàyoge tu kñaù'' (“The ''varëas'' beginning with ''ka'' and ending with ''ha'' are called ''viñëujanas. Kña,'' however, is only the combination of ''ka'' and ''ña''”). But even this statement suggests that ''kña'' is actually included as the final member of the alphabet, otherwise there would be no need to exclude it from the ''viñëujanas''. Taking these reasons into consideration, we also have included ''kña'' as the final member of the alphabet in this edition.

Çréla Prabhupäda also gives an interesting explanation of the name Adhokñaja which supports the inclusion of ''kña'': “And in Sanskrit, as in English it is A to Z, similarly in Sanskrit, ''a, ä, i, u,'' and the end is ''kña.'' So ''a'' and ''kña,'' that is called ''akña. Akña-ja.'' And ''ja'' means generated. So we also compose words, those who are Sanskrit scholars, they compose words from ''a'' to ''kña,'' just like English they compose words from A to Z. So our mental speculation and advancement of education is limited between this ''a'' and ''kña, akña. Akña-ja.'' But Kåñëa is ''adhokñaja.'' ''Adhokñaja'' means where these kinds of speculation, beginning from ''a'' to ''kña,'' will not act. Therefore His name is Adhokñaja. ''Adhaù kåta,'' cut down.” (Lecture on ''Çrémad-Bhägavatam'' 1.8.19—Mäyäpura, September 29, 1974).

'''''Amåta—'''''Someone may wonder, “It was stated that the ''varëas'' and their order appeared from Näräyaëa[[# msocom 3|[MA3]]] [[# ftn2|[2]]], but from where did each ''varëa'' appear?” To answer this, Jéva Gosvämé specifies each ''varëa’s'' place of appearance:

'''''Våtti—'''''The place of appearance of these ''varëas'' is as below and so on[[# ftn3|[3]]].

The place of appearance of ''a, ä, ka-varga'' (''ka, kha, ga, gha, ìa''), ''ha,'' and ''visarga'' (''ù'') is the throat of Näräyaëa.

The place of appearance of ''i, é, ca-varga'' (''ca, cha, ja, jha, ïa''), ''ya,'' and ''ça'' is the palate of Näräyaëa.

The place of appearance of ''u, ü,'' and ''pa-varga'' (''pa, pha, ba, bha, ma'') is the lips of Näräyaëa.

The place of appearance of ''å, è, öa-varga'' (''öa, öha, òa, òha, ëa''), ''ra,'' and ''ña'' is the top of the palate of Näräyaëa.

The place of appearance of ''ÿ, ÿ‾, ta-varga'' (''ta, tha, da, dha, na''), ''la,'' and ''sa'' is the teeth of Näräyaëa.

The place of appearance of ''e'' and ''ai'' is the throat and the palate of Näräyaëa.

The place of appearance of ''o'' and ''au'' is the throat and the lips of Näräyaëa.

The place of appearance of ''v'' is the teeth and the lips of Näräyaëa.

The place of appearance of ''anusvära'' (''à'') is either the head or nose of Näräyaëa.

'''''Saàçodhiné—'''''Because the ''varëas'' appeared from Näräyaëa in these specific places, these are the proper places to pronounce the ''varëas.'' The ''varëas'' ''a, ä, ka-varga'' (''ka, kha, ga, gha, ìa''), ''ha,'' and ''visarga'' (''ù'') are called ''kaëöhya'' because their place of pronunciation is the throat (''kaëöha''). The ''varëas'' ''i, é, ca-varga'' (''ca, cha, ja, jha, ïa'')'', ya,'' and ''ça'' are called ''tälavya'' because their place of pronunciation is the palate (''tälu''). Other names, also made according to the place of pronunciation, are shown below along with their English equivalents.

'''''Amåta—''Explanation of Näräyaëa:'''
----[[# ftnref1|[1]]] The ''pratyähäras'' have been dealt with only briefly in this book; for more details consult ''Añöädhyäyé'' or ''Siddhänta-kaumudé.''

[[# ftnref2|[2]]] In this ''sütra'' Näräyaëa is the ''apädäna'' (“origin”) by ''prabhave tat-sthänam'' (982), because the eternal ''varëas,'' already existing within the Lord, are manifest from Him. The word ''näräyaëa'' then becomes ''näräyaëät'' as an ''apädäna'' takes ''païcamé'' (“the fifth case ending”) by ''apädäne païcamé'' (981)''.'' Here ''Bäla'' says Näräyaëa is an ''apädäna'' by ''janane prakåtiù'' (983), but that is incorrect as the ''varëas'' are eternal sounds and thus are not produced at any time. In this regard, Jéva Gosvämé defines the difference between ''prabhava'' and ''janana'' in ''våtti'' by saying ''prabhavaù prathama-darçanam, jananam utpattir iti bhedaù'' (“''Prabhava'' is the first sight of something that already exists, while ''janana'' is the appearance of something that didn’t exist previously”).

[[# ftnref3|[3]]] The meaning of the word ''ity-ädéni,'' “these and so on”, at the end of this ''våtti'' will be seen in ''sütras'' 15, 25, 131, and 132 where further ''varëas'' and their places of pronunciation are mentioned.
----[[# msoanchor 1|[BE1]]]"Either" would be better than "also" here.

[[# msoanchor 2|[MAD2]]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;check with an editor how to use the elypsis

[[# msoanchor 3|[MA3]]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;reference the ''sütra''s in the footnote

[[# msoanchor 4|[BE4]]]This is not the right aksara.

Here the word ''nara'' (“human”) means a Vraja-väsé (“resident of Våndävana”), and the whole community of Vraja-väsés is called ''nära.'' The ''vigraha'' (“separation of the constituent words”) of the compound word ''näräyaëa'' is: ''näram ayanam yasya saù näräyaëaù'' (“Näräyaëa is He whose shelter is the Vraja-väsés”) Thus the word ''näräyaëa'' here means Çré Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead who appears in a human-like form.

This understanding is backed up by the ''Bhägavatam'' (10.25.18): ''tasmän mac-charaëaà goñöhaà / man-näthaà mat-parigraham,'' where Kåñëa Himself states that the Vraja-väsés are His shelter, His protectors, and His family. In this verse the word ''goñöham'' implies the ''goñöha-väsés'', and ''goñöha-väsés'' means ''vraja-väsés'' because the word ''goñöha'' is a synonym of the word ''vraja''[[# ftn1|[1]]]. Kåñëa says that the Vraja-väsés are His shelter because He, being controlled by their love, is unable to even bathe, drink, eat, sleep, or enjoy without them. Thus in the ''Ädi Puräëa'' Kåñëa tells Arjuna:

''sahäyä guravaù çiñyä''

''bhujiñyä bändhaväù striyaù''

 ''satyaà vadämi te pärtha''

 ''gopyaù kià me bhavanti na''

“The ''gopés'' are My assistants, My gurus, My disciples, My maidservants, My relatives, and My consorts. O son of Påthä, I tell you the truth. What aren’t the ''gopés'' for Me?”

Even though the word ''näräyaëa'' can be used to express any ''viñëu-tattva,'' it primarily refers to Kåñëa, because He is the original Näräyaëa and because the ''avatäras'' headed by Matsya and Vämana, and even the three Puruñas are His parts (''aìgas''). This is corroborated by Lord Brahmä's statement in ''Bhägavatam'' (10.14.14):

''näräyaëas tvaà na hi sarva-dehinäm''

  ''ätmäsy adhéçäkhila-loka-säkñé''

''näräyaëo ’ìgaà nara-bhü-jaläyanät''

  ''tac cäpi satyaà na tavaiva mäyä''

“Are You not the original Näräyaëa, O supreme controller, since You are the Soul of every embodied being and the eternal witness of all created realms? Indeed, Lord Näräyaëa is Your expansion, and He is called Näräyaëa because He is the generating source of the primeval water of the universe. He is real, not a product of Your illusory Mäyä.”[[# msocom 1|[MA1]]]

In his commentary on this verse, Çrédhara Svämé gives the following definitions of the name Näräyaëa: ''näro jéva-samüho ’yanam äçrayo yasya saù'' (“He whose abode is the aggregate of ''jévas''”), and ''närasyäyanaà pravåttir yasmät saù'' (“He from whom the aggregate of ''jévas'' arises”). In explaining the phrase ''näräyaëo ’ìgam'' in this verse, Çrédhara Svämé gives an alternate etymology of the word ''näräyaëa'' for when it is used to refer to the well-known Näräyaëa who is a plenary portion of Kåñëa: ''naräd udbhütä ye ’rthäç catur-viàçati-tattväni tathä naräj jätaà yaj jalaà tad-ayanäd yo näräyaëa'' ''prasiddhaù so ’pi tavaiväìgaà mürtiù'' (“That Näräyaëa who is well-known because of His entering the twenty-four elements that appeared from Nara and the water that was produced from Nara, is also Your plenary portion[[# ftn2|[2]]]”).

In his ''Bhägavatam'' commentary named ''Krama-sandarbha,'' Jéva Gosvämé defines Näräyaëa in the following way: ''naräëäà dvitéya-tåtéya-puruña-bhedänäà samüho näraà tat-samañöi-rüpaù prathama-puruña eva; tasyäpy ayanaà pravåttir yasmät sa näräyaëaù'' (“Nära means the first Puruña, Käraëodaka-çäyé Viñëu, the aggregate form of the Naras who are the second and third Puruñas, Garbhodaka-çäyé Viñëu and Kñérodaka-çäyé Viñëu. Näräyaëa is He from whom even Käraëodaka-çäyé Viñëu arises”).

'''''Saàçodhiné—'''''It is well known that Lord Caitanya often called Advaita Äcärya, the celebrated incarnation of Mahä Viñëu (Käraëodaka-çäyé Viñëu), by the name Näòä. This is recorded both in the ''Caintanya-bhägavata'' and in the ''Caitanya-caritämåta.'' For example, in ''Caitanya-bhägavata'' (Madhya 2.264), Lord Caitanya says “By your loud chanting and Näòä's roaring I left Vaikuëöha and came here with My associates.” In his ''Gauòéya-bhäñya'' commentary to this verse, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarvasvaté Öhäkura explains the word ''näòä'' as follows:

“The editor of ''Çré Sajjana-toñaëé,'' Çrémad Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura, has written in Volume 7, Part 11, as follows: “Çréman Mahäprabhu often addressed Çréla Advaita Prabhu as Näòä. I have heard a number of meanings of the word ''näòä.'' Some Vaiñëava scholar has said that the word ''närä'' refers to Mahä-Viñëu because ''nära,'' the total aggregate of all living entities, is situated within Him. Is the word ''näòä'' a corruption of the word ''närä''? The people of Räòha-deça often use ''òa'' in place of ''ra.'' Is this the reason that the word ''närä'' has been written as ''näòä''? This meaning is often applicable.” The word ''nära'' or ''närä'' (''näòä'') is explained by Çrédhara Svämipäda in his ''Bhävärtha-dépikä'' commentary on ''Çrémad-Bhägavatam'' (10.14.14) as follows: “The word ''nära'' refers to the aggregate of living entities, and the word ''ayana'' refers to the shelter. You are Näräyaëa Himself because You are the supreme shelter of all embodied souls. You are Näräyaëa because all the propensities (''ayana'') of the living entities (''nära'') emanate from You. You are the supreme Näräyaëa because You know (''ayana'') all living entities (''nära''). You are renowned as Näräyaëa because You are the supreme shelter (''ayana'') of the water that emanates from Nara.” In the ''småtis'' it is stated: “All the truths born from Nara are known as ''närän'' by the learned scholars. Since the Supreme Lord is the shelter of this ''närän'', learned scholars glorify Him as Näräyaëa.” In the ''Manu-saàhitä'' (1.10) it is stated: “The waters are called ''nära,'' for they emanate from the Supersoul, Nara. As they are His original resting place (''ayana''), He is named Näräyaëa.””
----[[# ftnref1|[1]]] See the last ''sütra'' of ''Kådanta-prakaraëa.''

[[# ftnref2|[2]]] The Näräyaëa referred to here is Garbhodaka-çäyé Viñëu. Garbhodaka-çäyé Viñëu is also called Nara. When Nara entered the universe, He saw that within the universe there was only darkness and space, without a resting place. Thus He filled half of the universe with water from His own perspiration and laid Himself down on the same water. Because this water in the form of perspiration was produced from Nara, it is called Nära, and because Nara lies down on this water he is called Näräyaëa (“One whose resting place is the water called Nära”).

'''Heber Carl Jentzsch''' (born November 30, 1935)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/10-000-scientologists-got-this-e-mail-today-about-disconnection-their-church-president-and-a-mysterious-death-6723502|title=10,000 Scientologists Got This E-Mail Today About "Disconnection," their Church President, and a Mysterious Death|last=Ortega|first=Tony|date=2012-07-09|website=Village Voice|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; has served as president of the [[Church of Scientology International]] since 1982.

==Early life==
Heber Jentzsch was born in 1935 in Salt Lake City&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/07/scientology_heber_jentzsch_karen_de_la_carriere_email.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711223401/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/07/scientology_heber_jentzsch_karen_de_la_carriere_email.php |archivedate=2012-07-11 |df= }} ''Village Voice'', 10 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ybE9AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Heber+Jentzsch+1935&amp;dq=Heber+Jentzsch+1935&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uKqMVfGKCdWEyQTCnJOYAw&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg]&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in a [[Mormon]] family and named after Latter-day Saint apostle [[Heber C. Kimball]].&lt;ref name="slctrib921209"/&gt; Though he was never baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he identified himself as a "believing Mormon",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Inside the Church of Scientology | series = Larry King Live | serieslink = Larry King Live | airdate = 1993-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the son of polygamist Carl Jentzsch and Carl's third wife Pauline; Heber has 42 siblings.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientologists march on courthouse", UPI 20.5.1985&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 Carl was arrested, and excommunicated from [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref name="slctrib921209"/&gt;

Heber Jentzsch was educated at [[Weber College]] in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], [[Utah]] and the [[University of Utah]], where he graduated in 1959 with a degree in communications.&lt;ref name="slctrib921209"&gt;"Utah-Born Scientology President Says the Religion Saved His Life", ''The Salt Lake Tribune'', 9.12.1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alumni.utah.edu/u-news/april04/postit.htm University of Utah Alumni Association, April 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied Eastern religions.&lt;ref name="naisbitt"&gt;Jentzsch biography in John Naisbitt, ''High Tech High Touch: Technology and Our Accelerated Search for Meaning'', p. 253. Nicholas Brealey Publishing, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1967, Jentzsch worked as a journalist for the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://losangelesfreepress.com/about-2/ About | Los Angeles Free Press]&lt;/ref&gt;'' and an actor, having a bit part in the movie ''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=LA Weekly| first=Ron|last=Curran|date=April 4, 1986 |volume=9 |issue=19|title=Scientology: The other side of the looking glass}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Scientology - The Road to Total Freedom?  |series=Panorama |serieslink=Panorama_(TV_series) |network=[[BBC]] |station=BBC1 |airdate=27 April 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a small part in an episode of the 1960s television series ''[[Combat!]]'', and an uncredited role in the movie ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0421803|name=Heber Jentzsch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientology==

Jentzsch joined the Church of Scientology in 1967 after allegedly being cured by the Scientology [[Purification Rundown]] of radiation burns he had suffered since he was 15.&lt;ref name="slctrib921209"/&gt;

During the 1970s, Jentzsch became the public relations director of the later-notorious [[Guardian's Office]], serving as the Church of Scientology's chief press spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;Omar V. Garrison, ''Playing Dirty'', p. 142. Ralston-Pilot, 1980. {{ISBN|0-931116-04-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has continued in this role since his promotion to the post of President of the Church of Scientology International in 1982. In January 1986, Jentzsch faced the press on behalf of the Church to announce the death of [[L. Ron Hubbard]].&lt;ref&gt;Jon Atack, ''A Piece of Blue Sky'', p. 354. Lyle Stuart, 1990. {{ISBN|0-8184-0499-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has often appeared in newspaper interviews, aggressively defending the church on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xenutv.com/us/geraldo-heber.htm |title=Jentzsch appears on talk show Geraldo in 1991 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228092004/http://www.xenutv.com/us/geraldo-heber.htm |archivedate=2009-12-28 |df= }} (available at  as of 8 Feb 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his media prominence, Jentzsch has been called a [[titular head|titular]] president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951938-6,00.html Mystery of the Vanished Ruler], TIME, January 31, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes described as "the leading spokesperson for the Church of Scientology International" in Church publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/scnnews/jentzsch.htm |title=Heber C.

==Arrest and trial in Spain==

In 1988 Heber Jentzsch was arrested in [[Spain]] along with 69 other members of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = UPI | title = 51 Scientology leaders charged | newspaper = The Ottawa Citizen | pages = A13 | date = 1988-11-22 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Stephen | last = Koff | title = Judge orders Scientology leader jailed | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/51428680.html?FMT=FT&amp;dids=51428680:51428680&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT | work =  | publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 1988-11-24 | accessdate = 2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jentzsch was incarcerated in a Spanish jail for about three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1989/01/16/71535/index.htm FOLLOW-UPS: SHAMED IN SPAIN], Fortune, January 16, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; He was released and fled to the United States after Scientology paid a bail bond of approximately $1 million. Sixteen people, including Jentzsch, were charged with "illegal association" and various other crimes including tax fraud and endangering public health. The trial of the indictees began in February 2001, but Jentzsch himself did not appear; the prosecution called for him to be given a 56-year prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=15 Scientologists on Trial|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 8, 2001|author=[[Agence France-Presse]]|page=13; Section A; Column 6; Foreign Desk; Late Edition - Final; Dateline: Madrid, Feb. 7; Length: 87 words}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Madrid Provincial Court dismissed all but the conspiracy charge and eventually ruled ([[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]) that the prosecution had presented insufficient evidence to prove this charge as well,&lt;ref&gt;"Spanish Court Acquits Scientologists", Associated Press, December 3, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 2002, the last charge was formally dropped. The court ordered the bail bond be returned to Scientology with interest, nearly doubling the original 1988 bond amount.&lt;ref&gt;"Spanish court drops charges against Scientology chief after 14 years", Agence France Presse, April 11, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hellespontine Phrygia''' ({{lang-grc|Ἑλλησποντιακὴ Φρυγία}}, ''Hellēspontiakē Phrygia'') or '''Lesser Phrygia''' ({{lang|grc|μικρᾶ Φρυγία}}, ''mikra Phrygia'') was a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] [[satrapy]] (province) in northwestern [[Anatolia]], directly southeast of the [[Hellespont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jona Lendering|title=Hellespontine Phrygia|url=http://www.livius.org/articles/place/hellespontine-phrygia/|website=Livius|publisher=Livius.org|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its capital was [[Dascylium]], and for most of its existence it was ruled by the hereditary Persian [[Pharnacid dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jona Lendering|title=Hellespontine Phrygia|url=http://www.livius.org/articles/place/hellespontine-phrygia/|website=Livius|publisher=Livius.org|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Greater Phrygia, it made up the administrative provinces of the [[Phrygia]] region.{{sfn|Scott|1995|page=183}}

==History==
The satrapy was created in the beginning of the fifth century BC, during the time of administrative reorganisations of the territories in western [[Asia Minor]],{{sfn|Kinzl|2008|page=551}} which were amongst the most important Achaemenid territories. It was ruled by a hereditary [[Iran]]ian dynasty, that of the [[Pharnacid dynasty|Pharnacids]], who were directly related to the [[Achaemenid dynasty]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jona Lendering|title=Hellespontine Phrygia|url=http://www.livius.org/articles/place/hellespontine-phrygia/|website=Livius|publisher=Livius.org|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jona Lendering|title=Pharnabazus (2)|url=http://www.livius.org/articles/person/pharnabazus-2/|website=Livius|publisher=Livius.org|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Alexander the Great]] was conquering and incorporating the [[Achaemenid Empire]], he appointed [[Calas (general)|Calas]], a [[Macedon]]ian General to govern Hellespontine Phrygia in 334 BC, after he had sent Parmenio to secure [[Dascylium]], the provincial capital.{{sfn|Lyons|2015|page=30}} Calas, being the very first non-Achaemenid ruler of the province, was awarded the Persian title of "satrap", rather than a Macedonian title, and Alexander instructed him to collect the same tribute from his subjects that had been paid to [[Darius III]].{{sfn|Lyons|2015|page=30}} After [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s death in 323, the satrapy was awarded to [[Leonnatus]], who was killed in action in the [[Lamian War]]. The region was seized by [[Lysimachus]], was added to the [[Seleucid Empire]] after the [[Battle of Corupedium]] (281 BC), and was finally integrated in the [[Bithynia#Kingdom of Bithynia|Bithynian kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jona Lendering|title=Hellespontine Phrygia|url=http://www.livius.org/articles/place/hellespontine-phrygia/|website=Livius|publisher=Livius.org|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irreligion in Uruguay is not a new phenomenon, although is growing considerably. Uruguay in religious and irreligious terms is similar to Europe, where modernization, economic growth, have brought atheism, since 1990, Uruguayans referred Easter Week as "Tourism Week". Uruguay is also the most democratic country in the region observed for its civic culture.

===Venezuela===
In Venezuela secularization has been influencing the country, this is due to the increasing modernization of the country and improvement of education, during the 20th century Venezuela was one of the most religious countries with a dominant Catholicism, although in the early twenty-first century Protestants, atheists, agnostics, among other religions have grown in the country, the most professional people (scientists, doctors, writers, etc.) are often less believers. According to a study by the University of Cambridge, 11.7% of Venezuelans are without religion (atheists 6% and 5.7% of non-religious), also a national study estimated that 6% of Venezuelans are agnostics and 2% atheists (in total of 8% of the population).

A '''jiangshi''', also known as a Chinese "hopping" [[vampire]], is a type of reanimated corpse in [[Chinese folklore|Chinese legends and folklore]]. "Jiangshi" is read '''goeng-si''' in Cantonese, '''cương thi''' in Vietnamese, '''gangshi''' in Korean, '''kyonshī''' in Japanese, and "hantu pocong" in Malay and Indonesia. It is typically depicted as a stiff corpse dressed in official [[Hanfu|garments]] from the [[Qing Dynasty]], and it moves around by hopping, with its arms outstretched. It kills living creatures to absorb their ''[[qi]]'', or "life force", usually at night, while in the day, it rests in a coffin or hides in dark places such as caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mythicalcreaturesguide.com/page/JiangShi|title=Search Results - Mythical Creatures Guide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jiangshi legends have inspired a [[Jiangshi fiction|genre of jiangshi films]] and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia.

==Genesis==
The [[Qing Dynasty]] scholar [[Ji Xiaolan]] mentioned in his book ''Yuewei Caotang Biji'' (閱微草堂筆記) that the causes of a corpse being reanimated can be classified in either of two categories: a recently deceased person returning to life, or a corpse that has been buried for a long time but does not decompose. Some causes are described below:

* The use of supernatural arts to resurrect the dead.
* [[Spirit possession]] of a dead body.
* A corpse absorbs sufficient [[yin and yang|yang]] ''[[qi]]'' to return to life.
* A person's body is governed by [[Hun and po|three ''huns'' and seven ''pos'']]. The Qing Dynasty scholar [[Yuan Mei]] wrote in his book ''[[Zi Bu Yu]]'' that "A person's ''hun'' is good but his ''po'' is evil, his ''hun'' is intelligent but his ''po'' is not so good". The ''hun'' leaves his body after death but his ''po'' remains and takes control of the body, so the dead person becomes a Jiangshi.
* The dead person is not buried even after a funeral has been held. The corpse comes to life after it is struck by a bolt of lightning, or when a pregnant cat (or a black cat in some tales) leaps across the coffin.
* When a person's soul fails to leave the deceased's body, due to improper death, suicide, or just wanting to cause trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.ufo.org.tw/news/2009/020209-1.htm 充滿詭異色彩 文獻記載湘南恐怖僵屍村傳說] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228204529/http://www.ufo.org.tw/news/2009/020209-1.htm |date=2009-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://ck101.com/viewthread.php?tid=672267 殭屍的七個等級]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A person injured by a Jiangshi is infected with the "Jiangshi Virus" and gradually changes into a Jiangshi over time, as seen in the ''[[Mr. Vampire]]'' films.

==Appearance==
Generally, a Jiangshi's appearance can range from unremarkable (as in the case of a recently deceased person) to horrifying (rotting flesh, ''[[rigor mortis]]'', as with corpses that have been in a state of decay over a period of time). The Chinese character for "jiang" (僵) in "Jiangshi" literally means "hard" or "stiff". It is believed that the Jiangshi is so stiff that it cannot bend its limbs and body, so it has to move around by hopping while keeping its arms stretched out for mobility. Jiangshi are depicted in popular culture to have a paper [[fulu|talisman]] (with a sealing spell) attached onto and hanging off the forehead in portrait orientation, and wear a uniform coat-like robe and round-top tall rimmed hat characteristic of a [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] (Chinese official from during the Qing dynasty). A peculiar feature is its greenish-white skin; one theory is that this is derived from [[fungus]] or [[mould]] growing on corpses. It is said to have long white hair all over its head&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Groot|first=JJM|title=The Religious System of China|year=1892–1910|publisher=The Hague}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may behave like animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://blog.qq.com/qzone/945012937/1210169439.htm 世界上真的有僵尸吗？] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218160340/http://blog.qq.com/qzone/945012937/1210169439.htm |date=2009-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of western vampire stories brought the blood-sucking aspect to the Chinese myth in more modern times in combination with the concept of the [[hungry ghost]], though traditionally they feed solely on the qi of a living individual for sustenance and in order to grow more powerful.

==Methods and items used to counter Jiangshis==
* Mirrors: [[Li Shizhen]]'s medical book ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' mentioned, "A mirror is the essence of liquid metal. It is dark on the external but bright inside." (鏡乃金水之精，內明外暗。) Jiangshis are also said to be terrified of their own reflections.
* Items made of wood from a [[peach]] tree: The ''Jingchu Suishi Ji'' (荊楚歲時記) mentioned, "Peach is the essence of the [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]]. It can subjugate evil auras and deter evil spirits." (桃者，五行之精，能厭服邪氣，制御百鬼。)
* A rooster's call: [[Yuan Mei]]'s book ''[[Zi Bu Yu]]'' mentioned, "Evil spirits withdraw when they hear a rooster's call" (鬼聞雞鳴即縮。), because the rooster's call usually occurs with the rise of the sun.
* [[Jujube]] seeds: ''Zi Bu Yu'' mentioned, "Nail seven jujube seeds into the [[acupuncture point]]s on the back of a corpse." (棗核七枚，釘入屍脊背穴。)
* Fire: ''Zi Bu Yu'' mentioned, "When set on fire, the sound of crackling flames, blood rushes forth and bones cry." (放火燒之，嘖嘖之聲，血湧骨鳴。)
* Hooves of a black donkey: Mentioned in Zhang Muye's fantasy novel ''[[Ghost Blows Out the Light]]''
* Vinegar: Mentioned by coroners in eastern [[Fujian]]
* [[Ba gua]] sign
* ''[[I Ching]]''
* ''[[Zhou Dunyi#Tong Shu|Tong Shu]]''
* [[Glutinous rice]], rice chaff
* [[Adzuki bean]]s
* [[Handbell]]

==Origin stories==
A supposed source of the jiangshi stories came from the folk practice of "transporting a corpse over a thousand ''[[li (unit)|li]]''" ({{zh|t=千里行屍|s=千里行尸|p=qiān lǐ xíng shī}}). The relatives of a person who died far away from home could not afford vehicles to have the deceased person's body transported home for burial, so they would hire a Taoist priest to conduct a ritual to reanimate the dead person and teach him/her to "hop" their way home. The priests would transport the corpses only at night and would ring bells to notify others in the vicinity of their presence because it was considered bad luck for a living person to set eyes upon a jiangshi. This practice, also called ''Xiangxi ganshi'' ({{zh|t=湘西趕屍|s=湘西赶尸|p=Xiāngxī gǎn shī|l=driving corpses in Xiangxi}}), was popular in [[Xiangxi]], where many people left their hometown to work elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.zjol.com.cn/05gotrip/system/2004/02/26/006054504.shtml 湘西“赶尸”习俗]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://read.anhuinews.com/system/2004/10/22/001023100.shtml 神秘骇人的湘西“赶尸”揭秘(图) ]&lt;/ref&gt; After they died, their bodies were transported back to their hometown because it was believed that their souls would feel homesick if they were buried somewhere unfamiliar to them. The corpses would be arranged upright in single file and be tied to long bamboo rods on the sides, while two men (one at the front and one at the back) would carry the ends of the rods on their shoulders and walk. When the bamboo flexed up and down, the corpses appeared to be "hopping" in unison when viewed from a distance away.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.zaobao.com/special/newspapers/2004/10/others221004.html 湘西赶尸骗局被揭穿]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110719162437/http://www.51766.com/xinwen/11011/1101189265.html 无法破译的湘西三邪：赶尸、放蛊、落花洞女！]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://travel.sohu.com/20090914/n266715927.shtml 湘西“赶尸匠”后人揭秘真相 (图)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two oral accounts of transporting corpses are included in [[Liao Yiwu]]'s ''The Corpse Walker''. One account describes how corpses would be transported by a two-man team. One would carry the corpse on his back with a large robe covering both of them and a mourning mask on top. The other man would walk ahead with a lantern and warn his companion about obstacles ahead of him. The lantern was used as a visual guide for the corpse carrier to follow since they could not see with the robe covering them. It is speculated in the accounts in the book that corpses would be carried at night to avoid contact with people and the cooler air would be more suitable to transporting bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233578030 Liao, Yiwu. ''The Corpse Walker: Real Life Stories, China from the Bottom Up''. New York: Pantheon Books, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{Who|date=October 2010}} speculate that the stories about jiangshi were originally made up by smugglers who disguised their illegal activities as corpse transportation and wanted to scare off law enforcement officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://liubowen.tripod.com/history/t-cadaver.htm 「湘西趕屍」說法和其真偽]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their modern visual depiction as horrific Qing officials may have been derived by the [[anti-Manchuism|anti-Manchu]] or [[anti-Qing sentiment]]s of the [[Han Chinese]] population during the Qing Dynasty, as the officials were viewed as bloodthirsty creatures with little regard for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lam|first=Stephanie|year=2009|title=Hop on Pop: Jiangshi Films in a Transnational Context|journal=CineAction|issue=78|pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the conventional wisdom of [[feng shui]] in Chinese architecture that a [[threshold (door)|threshold]] ({{zh|t=門檻|s=门槛|p=ménkǎn}}), a piece of wood approximately 15&amp;nbsp;cm (6&amp;nbsp;in) high, be installed along the width of the door at the bottom to prevent a jiangshi from entering the household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pennyblood.com/chinesevampires.html|title=Hopping Mad: A Brief Look at Chinese Vampire Movies|work=Penny Blood Magazine|accessdate=2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library's collection has not remained intact, although some original documents remain.  The existing building, built in 1990, houses the existing collection.

The art collection of the Kanazawa Bunko includes [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] portraits, [[East Asian calligraphy|calligraphy]], Chinese and Japanese classics, Buddhist sutras, and [[Zen]] writings. It is housed in a building within the [[Shōmyōji temple]]'s precincts, though in a separate building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen (ed.)|first1=Susan|title=History and Cultural Heritage of Chinese Calligraphy|date=2010|publisher=IFLA|isbn=978-3-598-22046-3|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb5sJ5NGVvIC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=kanazawa+bunko+library&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=59AKwhX-i_&amp;sig=ppBftCgdTF-lr1oT4HLJZCyR8Gw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3q6Gdh9fSAhWIWSYKHbsAC3sQ6AEIQTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=kanazawa%20bunko%20library&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection includes an eleven-headed [[Kannon]] (Goddess of Mercy), a [[Maitreya|Miroku]], [[Map of Japan (Kanazawa Bunko)|a map of Japan]], and other images designated as [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Properties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Prefecture Website|url=https://www.planet.pref.kanagawa.jp/city/kanazawa.htm|website=Kanagawa Prefectural Kanazawa-Bunko Museum|publisher=Kanagawa Prefecture|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2949">A gaurav '''''kanthi''''' , or simply '''''kanthi''''' ({{lang-sa|कण्ठी}}, ''kaṇṭhī'', &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit|literally}}.&lt;/small&gt; "necklace"), is a [[necklace]] worn by some adherents of [[Hinduism]].

==In Vaishnavism==
[[File:Hansadutta.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Hansadutta Swami]] of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] wearing [[Ocimum tenuiflorum|tulsi]] ''kanthi mala''.]]
Followers of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] wear ''kanthi malas'' made of ''[[Ocimum tenuiflorum]]'' (known in Hinduism as tulsi or ''tulasī'').&lt;ref name=z&gt;{{cite book|title=Plants of life, plants of death|first=Frederick J. |last=Simoons|year=1998|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KEUAbrBoeBAC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=kanthi+mala+krishna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6U0WT-SMKojqrAeg98Ra&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=kanthi%20mala%20krishna&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Vaishnavas will be given their ''kanthi'' by their [[guru]] at the time of [[diksha]], or spiritual initiation.

It is said [[Krishna]] – who is revered as ''svayam bhagavān'', or the [[monotheistic]] God, in Gaudiya Vaishnavism – was very fond of tulsi, and as such the plant is worshipped as ''"Tulasī [[devi]]"'' by followers of Krishna.&lt;ref name=z/&gt; Tulsi devi is considered to be "one of Krishna's most intimate servants"&lt;ref name=K&gt;{{cite web|last=devi dasi|first=Govinda|title=Tulasi Devi, Beloved of Krishna|url=http://www.krishna.com/tulasi-devi-beloved-krishna}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provide protection to his devotees, and as such, Gaudiya Vaishnavas will try to avoid removing their tulsi ''kanthis'' under any circumstances.

==In Shaivism==
[[Shaivism|Shaivite]]s wear ''kanthi'' made of [[rudraksha]].&lt;ref name=z/&gt; The name "rudraksha" is derived from the Sanskrit ''rudrākṣa'', meaning "[[Shiva]]'s eyes".

==In other traditions==
''Kanthi malas'' are also worn by followers of the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]] and the [[Kabir panth]]. [[Swaminarayan]] instructed his followers to wear a double-stranded ''kanthi'' made of [[tulsi]], symbolising [[Radha Krishna|Radha–Krishna]], while [[Kabir]] instructed his disciples to wear triple-stranded ''kanthis'' – symbolising the Hindu trinity of [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]] – with one large bead made from either tulsi or rudraksha for ''Satya Purush'', the "supreme lord who dwells within, who is above all else."&lt;ref name="isbn8120606515"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Behramji Merwanji Malabari |author2=Krishnalal M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7365">'''Kukuraja''' was a [[mahasiddha]] within the lineages of [[Esoteric Buddhism]] and he was contemporaneous with [[Indrabhuti]] of [[Sahor]] i.e.
 modern day [[Lahore]] in [[Oddiyana]] (also known as King Ja)  and [[Kambalapada]] (also known as Lawapa).

Some sources hold that it was Kukuraja who prophesied the birth of [[Garab Dorje]], the founder of the human lineage of the [[Nyingma]]pa [[Dzogchen]] Tantra teachings though the chronology is problematic. The tradition holds that there may be multiple Kukaraja's which are conflated (a view also propounded by modern scholarship) or the different Kukkaraja according to Nyingma tradition may be understood as a lineage of [[mindstream]] emanations.

==Instruction==
According to Nyingma tradition, King Ja taught himself intuitively from "the Book" of the Tantric Way of Secret Mantra (that is Mantrayana) that magically fell from the sky along with other sacred objects and relics "upon the roof of King Ja" according to [[Dudjom Rinpoche|Dudjom]] (1904–1987),'' et al.'' (1991: p.&amp;nbsp;613 History) took place on the [[Tibetan calendar]] year of the Earth Monkey, which Dudjom '' et al.'' identify as 853 BC[E].&lt;ref&gt;Dorje, Jikdrel Yeshe ([[Dudjom Rinpoche]], author), &amp; translated and edited: [[Gyurme Dorje]] and [[Matthew Kapstein]] (1991). ''The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History''. Boston, USA: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-199-8}}, p.613 History.&lt;/ref&gt; Kukuraja received instruction drawn from "the Book" on what may be understood as the [[Outer Tantras]] from King Ja, then King Ja received instruction on what may be understood as the [[Inner Tantras]] from Kukuraja (Kukkuraja taught King Ja after Kukkuraja received a direct revelation of [[Vajrasattva]] wherein Vajrasattva prophesied the imminent [[esoteric transmission]] of [[Vajrapani]], the Lord of Secrets, to Kukuraja which was only made possible through the quickening of Kukuraja by King Ja with his intuitive knowledge drawn from "the Book") as [[Dudjom Rinpoche|Dudjom]] (1904–1987),'' et al.'' (1991: p.&amp;nbsp;460) of the principally [[Nyingma]] [[View (Buddhism)|view]] relates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Then King Ja taught the book to master Uparaja, who was renowned as a great scholar throughout the land of Sahor, but he could not understand their symbolic conventions and meaning. The king then taught them to the master Kukkuraja. He intuitively understood the chapter on the "Vision of Vajrasattva", from the ''Tantra of the Magical Net of Vajrasattva'' [Wylie: rdo rje sems dpa' sgyu 'phrul drva ba (also known as the [[Guhyagarbha Tantra]])], and practiced it, whereupon Vajrasattva revealed himself and predicted that the Lord of Secrets would reveal the meanings of this tantra thereafter. When he had practised more, the Lord of Secrets actually appeared and granted him [Kukkuraja] the complete empowerment of the authentic teaching and of all vehicles. Then he told him to request the verbal teaching from the Licchavi Vimalakirti. It is said that, following the transmitted precepts of the Lord of Secrets, master Kukkuraja divided [the [[Mahayoga#Mahayoga textual tradition|Mahayoga tantras]]] into the Eighteen Great Tantrapitaka (tantra chen-po sde bco-brgyad) and taught them to King Ja."&lt;ref&gt;Dorje, Jikdrel Yeshe ([[Dudjom Rinpoche]], author), &amp; translated and edited: [[Gyurme Dorje]] and [[Matthew Kapstein]] (1991). ''The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History''. Boston, USA: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-199-8}}, p.460 History.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interpreter==
Kukuraja interpreted Tantras for King Indrabhuti. Indrabhuti is held in some sources to be the father of [[Padmasambhava]].

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
Kukuraja, Kukkuraja, Kukuradza, Kukkuradza and many other permutations.

==Indonesian or Malay Mantranaya==
There is a Dancing Ganesha at [[Candi Sukuh]] that holds a small dog, a marked Buddhadharma motif of the Hindu deity which holds iconic salience with the narrative and motifs of the "Dog King", Kukuraja. This is important for identifying the date of the tantric lineage(s) that disseminated to the Indonesian archipelago, refer: [[Vajrayana Buddhism in Southeast Asia]].

'''[[Candi Sukuh]] ''' is a fifteenth-century [[Javanese people|Javanese]]-[[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] temple ([[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]) that demonstrates strong [[tantra|tantric]] influence. Candi Sukuh is located on the western slope of [[Mount Lawu]] ([[elevation|elev.]] 910&amp;nbsp;m or {{convert|3000|ft|m}} [[above sea level]]) on the border between [[Central Java|Central]] and [[East Java]] provinces. The monument was built around 1437, as written as a [[chronogram]] date on the western gate, meaning that the area was under the rule of the [[Majapahit Kingdom]] during its end (1293–1500). The distinctive Dancing Ganesha relief in Candi Sukuh has a similarity with the [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] ritual found in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|history of Buddhism in Tibet]] written by [[Taranatha]].&lt;ref name="oconnor"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Indonesia |title=Metallurgy and Immortality at Caṇḍi Sukuh, Central Java |url=http://cip.cornell.edu:80/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/seap.indo/1107006615 |volume=39 |year=1985 |pages=53&amp;ndash;70 |author=Stanley J. O'Connor |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AMetallurgy+and+Immortality+at+Ca%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Di+Sukuh%2C+Central+Java&amp;as_publication=Indonesia&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |doi=10.2307/3350986 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830202846/http://cip.cornell.edu/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/seap.indo/1107006615 |archivedate=August 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tantric ritual is associated with several figures, one of whom is described as the "King of Dogs" (Sanskrit: Kukuraja), the [[mahasiddha]] who taught his disciples by day, and by night performed ''[[Ganacakra]]'' in a burial ground or [[charnel ground]]. Importantly, Ganesha also appears in Buddhism, not only in the form of the Buddhist god {{IAST|Vināyaka}}, but also portrayed as a Hindu [[demon]] form also called {{IAST|Vināyaka}}.&lt;ref&gt;Getty, pp. 37-45. "Chapter 4: Ganesha in Buddhism".&lt;/ref&gt;  Ganesha's image may be found on Buddhist sculptures of the late [[Gupta period]].&lt;ref&gt;Getty, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Buddhist god {{IAST|Vināyaka}}, Ganesha is often shown dancing, a form called Nṛtta Ganapati that was popular in North India and adopted in Nepal and then into Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Getty, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this Dancing Ganesha form which is evident in Candi Sukuh. For more information on different permutations of Ganesha beyond 'Hinduism' proper, refer [[Ganesha in world religions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5290">In [[Greek mythology]], '''Larissa''' or '''Larisa''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Λάρισσα}}) was the name of two different figures that appears in various accounts:

== Larisa, daughter of Pelasgus ==
[[File:Thessaly Larissa Drachm.xcf|alt=Silver drachm of Larissa|thumb|251x251px|Silver drachm from Larissa with front-facing portrait of the nymph Larissa. Dated c. 380-365 BC. References:  L-S Series 5, BCD Thessaly II 292, HGC 4, 446]]
Larisa was a [[nymph]] from [[Thessaly]]. She was described by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] as a daughter of [[Pelasgus]], son of [[Triopas]], king of&amp;nbsp;Argos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.24.1&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 Pausanias, ''Description of Greece Book 2.24.1''] with an English Translation by W.H.S. Jones, Litt.D., and H.A. Ormerod, M.A., in 4 Volumes. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hellanicus of Lesbos|Hellanicus]] states that the sons of [[Poseidon]] and Larissa were [[Achaeus (son of Poseidon)|Achaios]], [[Phthius (mythology)|Phthios]], and Pelasgus. These sons left Argos and arrived in Haemonia (Thessaly) where they drove out the barbarian inhabitants and divided the country into three parts, calling them, after the their names, [[Phthiotis]], [[Achaea|Achaia]] and [[Pelasgiotis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html Dionysius of Halicarnassus,&amp;nbsp;''The Roman Antiquities, 1.17.3'']&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Larissa (Argolis)|arx of Argos]] and two towns ([[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]] and one in the Peneus) are believed to have derived their name (meaning "citadel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*la%2Frisa Λάρισα], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) from her.&lt;ref&gt;Smith p.722&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=February 2013}}&lt;!--this does not make sense. The Pelasigan word means "citadel". The Greek nymph is named after this, not vice versa--&gt;[[File:Larissa drachma.jpg|thumbnail|right|Silver [[drachma]] from [[Larissa]], 410&amp;ndash;405 BC, depicting the nymph Larissa. Reverse: Bridled horse galloping, inscriptions IA, ΛΑΡΙΣΑ.|250x250px]]She was represented on the obverse of common drachms produced by the city of [[Larissa]] between 400 BCE and at least 340 BCE, as a three-quarters face with outward flowing hair.&lt;ref name="Morkholm"&gt;Mørkholm  p.85&lt;/ref&gt; This style was copied from the head of [[Arethusa (mythology)|Arethusa]] by [[Cimon]], depicted on [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusan]] tetradrachms.&lt;ref name="Morkholm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larson p.166&lt;/ref&gt;  According to hoard evidence from Thessaly, this coinage was produced down to c. 320 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Bellinger&lt;/ref&gt; Other coins depict Larissa seated, holding a [[hydria]] and with a spring nearby, confirming her status as a [[nymph]].&lt;ref&gt;Larson p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Larissa (moon)|moon of Neptune]] was discovered by Harold J. Reitsema, William B. Hubbard, Larry A. Lebofsky and David J. Tholen on May 24, 1981 and later given the name Larissa. Larissa is also designated as "Neptune VII", S/1981 N 1 and "S/1989 N 2".

== Larisa, daughter of Piasus ==
Larissa was the daughter of the Pelasgian prince, [[Piasus]] and wife of [[Cyzicus (mythology)|Cyzicus]], king of the [[Dolionians]], the people of northwestern Asia Minor visited by the Argonauts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/Parthenius2.html#28 Parthenius'', Love Romances 28.1'']. Translated by Edmonds, J M and Gaselee, S. Loeb Classical Library Volume 69. Cambridge, Massachusetts. Harvard University Press. 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] reported that "before her marriage, her father Piasus fell in love with her and, having violated her, paid the penalty for the outrage; on that account Larisa, observing him leaning over a cask of wine, seized him by the legs, raised him, and plunged him into the cask, drowning him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Strab.+13.3.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198 Strabo.''Geography 13.3.4.''] Edited by H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6093">The main function of '''Lozi mythology''' is to show that the original [[Lozi people]] (the Luyi or Luyana) were dwellers on the [[Barotse Floodplain]] of the upper [[Zambezi River]] and that they are, therefore, entitled to claim unchallenged title to that homeland. Secondly, Lozi mythology gives legitimacy to the Lozi kingdom's foundations, by linking the [[monarchy]] and the people to a creator god, whom the Lozi call Nyambe.

Nyambe's wife was Nasilele (which means "she who is associated with long things") and his mother was Ngula (which means "she who is pregnant"). Nyambe is said to have created both his wife and his mother. He is also said to have created everything else that exists, including the [[heaven]], the [[Earth]] and all the [[plants]] and [[animals]].

== The founding myths ==
The [[Lozi people|Lozi]] [[founding myth]] is not cast in stone, there are several versions of it, depending on who is telling the [[Narrative|story]]. Like any other [[oral tradition]], it has changed with the passage of time, but there are some elements that do not change, such as the name of the [[Creator deity|creator]] god, the name of the [[List of first men or women in mythology and religion|first man]], and the name of the first sovereign.

The three versions of the Lozi founding myth given below are not the only ones.

=== Nyambe flees from Kamunu ===

One of Nyambe's creations was Kamunu, the first [[human being]]. Nyambe gave Kamunu the task of naming all the other creations and told the human being that all the animals were his siblings. As such he should look after them.

Kamunu, being the most intelligent of all Nyambe's creations, rapidly learned and copied Nyambe's various skills: the mastery over [[fire]]; the [[forging]] of [[metal]]; the art of moulding [[pottery]]; the [[Wood carving|carving]] of spoons, plates and canoes; the [[sowing]] of crops; and the [[domestication]] of animals. Although Nyambe was at first impressed, he soon became tired of Kamunu's mimicry, especially when the man started killing the animals and [[cooking]] their meat for [[food]]. Nyambe told Kamunu not to kill the other creatures but Kamunu would not stop. To punish this misbehaviour, Nyambe begun taking away Kamunu's possessions: first his pot broke, then his dog died and eventually his son died. This, according to the Lozi, was the way that [[death]] came to the [[human race]].

In frustration, Nyambe moved away from Kamunu on several occasions but, wherever Nyambe moved to on the [[Zambezi]] floodplains, Kamunu would follow. Eventually Nyambe decided to cross the [[Zambezi]] River, but Kamunu carved a [[canoe]] and followed. Nyambe built a [[mountain]] and lived on its summit, but Kamunu climbed the mountain and found Nyambe. Finally, Nyambe decided to move away from [[Earth]] into [[heaven]] (called Litooma in Lozi [[mythology]]). To accomplish this, and to prevent Kamunu from following, Nyambe instructed a [[spider]] to weave a web. Once Nyambe had used the spider's web to climb into Litooma, he blinded the spider so that it would not tell Kamunu how to get to heaven.

That is how Kamunu remained on Earth, condemned to live and die here after Nyambe refused to provide [[medicine]] to prevent [[disease]] and [[death]]. Hence death is Kamunu's divine punishment for his disobedient behaviour.

=== Nyambe founds the Lozi nation ===

In this version, Nyambe is shown to be the founder of the Lozi nation. Nyambe and his wife Nasilele had a daughter Mwambwa (which means "one who is being talked about"). In a variation on this theme, Nyambe is said to have created many wives for himself and had children by all of them. (This story also legitimises [[polygyny]] in the Lozi nation.) When Mwambwa had grown up, Nyambe fell in love with her and had [[incestuous]] [[sexual intercourse]] with her. When Nasilele found out what had happened between her husband and her daughter, she quarrelled with her husband and beat her daughter. Nyambe was so upset by his wife's behaviour that he called his servant, Sasisho, and announced his decision to return to heaven. Nyambe ordered a spider to spin a web, so that he and his servant could climb to heaven leaving Nasilele on Earth. Due to her remorse, Nasilele died a few weeks later.

Mwambwa, the daughter of Nyambe and Nasilele, later became the first Luyi sovereign and, therefore, founder of the nation. Her eldest daughter, whose name was Mbuyu and who was presumably [[Conceive a child|conceive]]d from the incest with Nyambe, took over the sovereignty from her mother.

=== Nyambe founds the Lozi nation as the first person ===

In this version of the founding myth, Nyambe was not the [[Creator deity|creator]] god but was the first human being. All Luyi peoples were said to have originated from him. In this account, the identity of the Creator is not stated explicitly. Instead, the people in the myth are simply stated to have been living on the Zambezi floodplains. Nyambe's village was called Litooma-mundi-wa-Nyambe (which means "heaven, the home of Nyambe" in Luyana) and his first wife was called Mwambwa. She later became the first female chief of the Luyi people. Through this myth, the Lozi royalty was said to originate from Mwambwa. She was, therefore, given the title Njemakati (which means "a woman from whom the kingdom originates"). She is also said to have given birth to nine other children, including a daughter named Mbuyu, who took over the sovereignty from her mother.

{{lang|la|'''Mater ter admirabilis'''}}, literally "Mother thrice admirable", is a [[Latin]] invocation from the [[Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].

==History==
It was first used by the [[Jesuit]] Father [[Jakob Rem]], head of the [[Sodality of Our Lady]], in [[Ingolstadt]], [[Bavaria]]  on April 5, 1604. The most common [[litany]] used nowadays, the [[Litany of Loreto]], uses the invocation ''Mater admirabilis'', which means "Mother admirable".

On April 4, 1604, the [[Colloquium Marianum]]  of the [[Jesuit Sodality at Ingolstadt]] was praying the [[Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]. As they came to the prayer,  ''“Mother most admirable, pray for us”'' Father Rem asked for a repeat and again for a repeat of the prayer. Since that time, the Colloquium Marianum and the sodalities used the triple prayer. ''Mater ter admirablilis''  continues to be used as a part of the sodality prayers worldwide.

Since 1915, Mater ter admirablilis is a part of the Marian prayers of the [[Schönstatt]] movement. Mater ter admirabilis is also a Marian altar in the Cathedral of Ingolstadt, where the solidarities used to meet on a daily basis for [[Holy Mass]]. It was never clarified whether the triple prayer refers to the [[Holy Trinity]], to the triple virginity of the Virgin Mary (before, during and after birth), or, to the [[Mother of God]], mother of the [[Redemption (theology)|Redeemer]] and mother of the [[Redemption (theology)|redeem]]ed.

==History==
Matrixism, also referred to as "The path of the One," was primarily introduced in 2004. A website on Yahoo GeoCities created by an anonymous source provided the basis for the religion. Matrixism is inspired by the [[Matrix trilogy]] and its associated stories (including the Animatrix).&lt;ref name="p"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circleofpneuma.blogspot.com/2005/04/matrixism.html|title=Matrixism|author=Johnson, Phil|publisher= Circle of Pneuma|date=April 10, 2005|accessdate= 2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these stories are not the sole foundation. The ideals of Matrixism can be traced back to the early 20th century to [[The Promulgation of Universal Peace]], the record of talks by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] during his [[`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="R&amp;PC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Rachael.

==Tenets==
Matrixism carried with it four main beliefs that are described as "The Four Tenets of Matrixism". Briefly these were: belief in a messianic prophecy, use of [[psychedelic drugs]] as [[sacrament]], a perception of reality as multi-layered and semi-subjective, and adherence to the principles of at least one of the world's major religions.&lt;ref name="sj"&gt;[[Sam Jordison|Jordison, Sam]] (2005). ''The Joy of Sects: An A-Z of Cults, Cranks and Religious Eccentrics: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sects But Were Afraid to Ask'', pp 127-9, Robson Books. {{ISBN|1861059051}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Matrixism website singles out April 19 as a holiday - otherwise known as [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide#"Bicycle_Day"|Bicycle Day]], April 19 marks the anniversary of [[Albert Hofmann]]'s 1943 experiment with LSD.&lt;ref name="hofmann"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hofmann |first=Albert |title=LSD: My Problem Child |year=1980 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0070293250 |pages=29 |chapter=From Remedy to Inebriant |chapterurl=http://www.flashback.se/archive/my_problem_child/chapter5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbology==
The adopted symbol for Matrixism was the Japanese ''[[kanji]]'' symbol for "red". This symbol was used in the video game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]''. The color is a reference to the [[Red pill and blue pill|red pill]], which represented an acceptance of and ability to see truth, as established early in the first Matrix film.&lt;ref name="matrix"&gt;{{cite video | people = [[Wachowski Brothers]]  | title = The Matrix | medium = DVD  | publisher = [[Warner Bros.]] | date = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1146">'''Milbourn Bloom''' (died 1766) was a Welsh Independent minister. He may have been related to the Blooms of Castell Pigyn (Abergwili). The records of the Methodist Association (1743) describe him as a ‘public exhorter’ (i.e. itinerant), with charge of several locations south of the Towy. According to H.J. Hughes, 'Life of Howell Harris' Bloom soon (in September 1743) left the Methodist church, entering  Independent ministry (being admitted a member of Pant Teg church, then under Christmas Samuel). After serving for a period as an ordained assistant to Christmas Samuel he is recorded as appointed pastor of [[Pen-y-Graig]] (1748 to 1757), and later of [[Gwernogle]], and of [[Pentre-ty-Gwyn]] (1757). According to Thomas Morgan he died in 1766.

A '''military chaplain''' ministers to [[military personnel]] and, in most cases, their families and [[civilians]] working for the [[military]]. In some cases they will also work with local civilians within a military area of operations.

Although the term ''[[chaplain]]'' originally had [[Christian]] roots,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hugh H. |last=Morgan |url=http://chaplains.iphc.org/stories/etymology.html |title=The Etymology of the Word Chaplain |work=International Pentecostal Holiness Church |accessdate=9 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905050247/http://chaplains.iphc.org/stories/etymology.html |archivedate=5 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is generally used today in military organizations to describe all professionals specially trained to serve any spiritual need, regardless of religious affiliation. In addition to offering [[pastoral care]] to individuals, and supporting their religious rights and needs, military chaplains may also advise the executive on issues of religion, and [[ethics]], [[morale]] and [[morals]] as affected by religion.  They may also [[wikt:liaison|liaise]] with local religious leaders in an effort to understand the role of religion as a factor both in hostility and war and in reconciliation and peace.&lt;ref name=TakingFaith&gt;{{cite web | first=Jane | last=Lampman | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1999/0304/p15s1.html | title=Taking faith to the 'new' front lines | quote=In all the hot spots – yet rarely mentioned – military chaplains are some of today's unsung heroes. | work=The [[Christian Science Monitor]] | date=4 March 1999 |accessdate=9 September 2010}} On the role of chaplains in multinational operations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military chaplains normally represent a religion or faith group but work with military personnel of all faiths and none. Some countries, like the Netherlands and Belgium,&lt;ref name="www2.canada.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/world/story.html?id=6a433205-7093-448b-b61e-d5be32aa3cb4 |title=Spiritual guidance without all that religion |publisher=.canada.com |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714113118/http://www2.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/world/story.html?id=6a433205-7093-448b-b61e-d5be32aa3cb4 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also employ ''[[Secular humanism|humanist]]'' chaplains who offer a non-religious approach to chaplain support.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] employs chaplains, but their authority comes from their sending church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/chaplains/whoweare/endorsingauthorities.cfm |title=RAF Chaplains - Endorsing Authorities |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Navy chaplains undertake a 16-week [[bespoke]] induction and training course, including a short course at [[Britannia Royal Naval College]], and specialist fleet time at sea alongside a more experienced chaplain. Naval chaplains called to service with the Royal Marines undertake a commando course at [[Commando Training Centre Royal Marines]], Lympstone and if successful serve with a front-line Royal Marines unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/Careers/Explore-Opportunities/Job-Finder/Roles/~/media/Files/CNR-PDFs/Chaplain.pdf |title=Chaplaincy |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Army chaplains undertake seven-weeks training at The Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre [[Amport House]] and the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.army.mod.uk/rolefinder/role/25/chaplain/&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Air Force chaplains must complete 12 weeks Specialist Entrant course at the [[RAF College Cranwell]] followed by a Chaplains' Induction Course at Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre [[Amport House]] of a further 2 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/chaplains/visitorjoin/joinfulltime.cfm |title=RAF Chaplains - Becoming a full time Commissioned RAF Chaplain |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the term, ''nomination'', is not generally applied to the process of becoming a military chaplain. Individuals volunteer, and if they are accepted, they are ''commissioned'' as military staff officers in the Chaplain Corps. Members of the clergy who meet the qualifications for service as an officer in the military are free to apply for service with any of the three United States Chaplain Corps: the Army, Navy, and Air Force each has a Chaplain Corps, with Navy chaplains also assigned to serve with Marine Corps units, Coast Guard units, and the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|Merchant Marine Academy]]. Some clergy, like rabbis, can apply without permission from any individual or organization within their faith group; others, in faith groups that have a hierarchy established to make decisions on the postings or positions of their members, must be granted permission from the appropriate official, such as the appropriate Bishop. As the application process proceeds, and the military determines whether the applicant will meet standards in areas such as health, physical fitness, age, education, citizenship, past criminal history, and ''suitability'' for service, which includes supporting the ''free exercise of religion'' for men and women of all faiths, an ''endorsement'' from an ''endorsing agency'' that is recognized by the Department of Defense, representing one or more faith groups in the United States, will be required, in part to ensure that the separation of church and state is honored. Neither the government as a whole nor the military in particular will be put into the position of determining whether an individual is a ''bona fide'' priest, minister, rabbi, imam, etc. (The requirement for such an endorsement has been in force since 1901, and today many of the various religious endorsing agencies work together under such non-governmental voluntary umbrella groups as the [[National Conference on Ministry to the Armed Forces]].) Although ordination is usually required for chaplain service, some "equivalent" status is accepted for individuals from religious groups which do not have ordination, such as the [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]]. Additionally, in cases where an endorsing agency is not yet established for an individual's religion, it is possible for him or her to be endorsed by the endorsing agency of another group, a process which was followed for the first Muslim chaplains in the military. In any event, this endorsement is recognized as ''necessary, but not sufficient'' for acceptance as a chaplain: in other words, the military will not accept an individual for service as a chaplain, nor allow him or her to continue to serve, without such an endorsement remaining in force; however, the decision as to whether to accept that individual remains with the military service, and the individual can be rejected for a number of reasons, including the needs of the military, even with the endorsement of an endorsing agency.

==Non-combatant status==
The [[Geneva Conventions]] are silent on whether chaplains may bear arms. However, the Conventions do state ([[Protocol I]], 8 June 1977, Art 43.2) that chaplains are [[non-combatants]]: they do not have the right to participate directly in hostilities.

It is generally assumed that during [[World War II]], chaplains were unarmed. Crosby describes an incident where a US chaplain became a trained tank gunner and was removed from the military for this "entirely illegal, not to mention imprudent" action.&lt;ref name="Crosby"&gt;{{cite book | last=Crosby | first=Donald F. | year=1994 | title=Battlefield Chaplains: Catholic Priests in World War II | place=Lawrence, KS | publisher=University Press of Kansas | isbn=0-7006-0814-1 | pages=xxi, xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least some British chaplains serving in the Far East, however, were armed: [[George MacDonald Fraser]] recalls&lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;{{cite book | last=Fraser | first=G.M. | year=1995 | edition=trade paperback | title=Quartered Safe Out Here: A Recollection of the War in Burma | place=London | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-272687-4 | pages=109, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the tall figure of the battalion chaplain, swinging along good style with his .38 on his hip" immediately behind the lead platoon during a battalion attack. Fraser asks, "if the padre shot [an enemy], what would the harvest be ... apart from three ringing cheers from the whole battalion?"&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt;
The Reverend [[Leslie Hardman]], the British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army's]] senior Jewish chaplain, who became well known for his work amongst the liberated prisoners after the capture of [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], was another who insisted on being armed while on active service.&lt;ref name="GuardianObituary"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/secondworldwar-judaism | title=Obituary: The Rev Leslie Hardman | work=The Guardian | date=October 13, 2008 | accessdate=15 April 2014 | author=Alderman, Geoffrey | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, both the UK and US have required chaplains, but not [[medical personnel]], to be unarmed in combat, although the US does not prohibit chaplains from earning marksmanship awards or participating in marksmanship competitions. Other nations, notably Norway, Denmark and Sweden, and also Australia,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJDmclwxTEU&amp;list=UUuuTCooIMbBFHNbPcSS7 "Afghanistan: Chaplains provide comfort to troops"], ''[[SBS World News]]'', 29 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; make it an issue of individual conscience. There are anecdotal accounts that even US and UK chaplains have at least occasionally unofficially borne weapons: Chaplain (then Captain) James D. Johnson, of the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]], Mobile Riverine Force in Vietnam describes (''Combat Chaplain: A Thirty-Year Vietnam Battle'') carrying the M-16 rifle while embedded with a combat patrol. Since 1909 US chaplains on operations have been accompanied by an armed chaplain assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usachcs.army.mil/TACarchive/AC71M/before_the_chaplain_assistant.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624212250/http://www.usachcs.army.mil/TACarchive/AC71M/before_the_chaplain_assistant.htm |date=June 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, perhaps on this occasion it was felt that an unarmed uniformed man would draw unwelcome attention.

Captured chaplains are not considered [[prisoners of war]] and must be returned to their home nation unless retained to minister to prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Third Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949, Chapter IV Art 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Inevitably, serving chaplains have died in action. The [[US Army]] and [[US Marines|Marines]] lost 100 chaplains killed in action during World War II: the third highest casualty rate behind the [[infantry]] and the [[Army Air Forces]].&lt;ref name="Crosby"/&gt; Many have been decorated for bravery in action (five have been awarded Britain's highest award for gallantry, the [[Victoria Cross]], and nine have received the [[Medal of Honor]]). The [[Chaplain's Medal for Heroism]] is a special [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|US military decoration]] given to military chaplains who have been killed in the line of duty, although it has to date only been awarded to the famous [[Four Chaplains]], all of whom died in the {{SS|Dorchester||2}} sinking in 1943 after giving up their lifejackets to others.

In 2006, training materials obtained by US intelligence showed that insurgent snipers fighting in Iraq were urged to single out and attack engineers, medics, and chaplains on the theory that those casualties would demoralize entire enemy units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pensitoreview.com/2006/10/25/iraqi-insurgent-snipers-target-us-medics-engineers-and-chaplains/ |title=Iraqi Insurgent Snipers Target U.S. Medics, Engineers and Chaplains |publisher=Pensito Review |date=25 October 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |first=Jon |last=Ponder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the training materials, there included an insurgent sniper training manual that was posted on the Internet. Among its tips for shooting US troops, there read: "Killing doctors and chaplains is suggested as a means of psychological warfare."

==Chief of chaplains/chaplain general==
[[File:Riley Chaplain-General.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Anglican Archbishop Riley addressing a crowd as 'Chaplain-General to the AIF']]
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}

Military chaplains are often supervised by a [[chaplain general]] or chief of chaplains, on the staff of the leader of the nation's military forces. In some countries, like Israel, Canada, and South Africa, one chief of chaplains/chaplain general serves in that position for all chaplains of all religions, in all branches of the military.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In many other countries, such as France, there is a separate chaplain general/chief of chaplains for each faith group represented by chaplains.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In other countries, like the United States, there is one chaplain general/[[Chiefs of Chaplains of the United States|chief of chaplains]] for each branch of the military. So, for example, in the United States, there is an [[Chief of Chaplains of the United States Army|Army]], [[Chief of Chaplains of the United States Navy|Navy]], and [[Chief of Chaplains of the United States Air Force|Air Force]] chief of chaplains. They meet on as representatives to the [[Armed Forces Chaplains Board]],&lt;ref name=AFCB&gt;[http://www.mfr.usmc.mil/HQ/Chaplains/Instructions/DOD%205120.08p%20Armed%20Forces%20Chaplains%20Board.pdf Armed Forces Chaplains Board]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (AFCB). Instruction Number 5120.08 (August 20, 2007). US Department of Defense. Retrieved 2010-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss issues that cross service lines, but each reports as a staff officer of his or her service, to the Chief of Staff of the Army or Air Force, or the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] of the Navy. (In the United States, Navy chaplains serve Navy, [[Chaplain of the United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and [[Chaplain of the Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] personnel. Navy chaplains also assigned to the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|Merchant Marine Academy]], for Merchant Marine personnel.)

==International organization==
The [[International Military Chiefs of Chaplains Conference]] grew out of a conference [[NATO]] chiefs of chaplains organized by the [[United States European Command]] (USEUCOM) in 1990.&lt;ref name=OpeningOfTheFirstInternational&gt;{{cite web|first=S Lt L.A |last=Benjamin |title=Opening of the First International Military Chief of Chaplains Conference |url=http://www.navy.mil.za/archive/0902/090204_Chaplains_conference/article.htm |accessdate=2011-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927075245/http://www.navy.mil.za/archive/0902/090204_Chaplains_conference/article.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It welcomes any chief of chaplains (or ''chaplain general'', an equivalent term used by many nations).

==Religions and faith group organization==
===Christianity===

====Roman Catholic Church====
{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
[[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] chaplains are generally organized into [[military ordinariate]]s, such as the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA|Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA]]. Potential Roman Catholic chaplains must seek permission from their [[diocesan bishop|diocesan]] [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] or [[religious superior]] to serve as a military chaplain. While serving as a chaplain, the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] or [[deacon]] remains [[incardinated]] in his home [[diocese]], but is temporarily under the direction of the [[prelate]] of the ordinariate for the duration of his service.

====Protestant denominations====
Each of the various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Christian denominations may set its own requirements for certification as a minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.robis.net/uploads/JID44_Military%20Chaplaincy%20guidelines%20final.pdf Serving the Lord as a Chaplain in the Armed Forces of the United States of America]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (adopted by the Home Missions Commission, June 2000). North American Baptist Conference. Retrieved 2010-09-10. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
[[File:Jewish service during World War I.jpg|thumb|Austrian Jewish military service during WWI (1914-18).]]
Besides the [[Military Rabbinate]] of Israel, today, military [[rabbi]]s serve throughout several countries of the world, most notably in the US military forces, and various European armies.
Since the rise of the Christian religion in Europe and worldwide, as a matter of course Christians fought against Christians over and over again. During World War I, for the first time a substantial number of Jews served on all sides of the war, and so did military rabbis. As a result of 18th and 19th centuries` emancipation, ''military field rabbis'' served on all fronts and in all combating nations.

==Badges and insignia==
[[File:Usnavy worshippennant.GIF|thumb|right|110px|Worship Pennant, flying over the National Ensign (American flag) on a US Navy ship.&lt;ref&gt;Per Navy customs, traditions and etiquette, [[Pennant (church)#United States Navy|Worship Pennants]] may be flown above the Ensign {{cite web | title=Naval Customs, Traditions, &amp; Etiquette – Church Pennant | url=http://www.public.navy.mil/usff/Pages/customs.aspx#churchpennant | work=US Fleet Forces | publisher=United States Navy | date= | accessdate= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613045812/http://www.public.navy.mil/usff/Pages/customs.aspx#churchpennant | archive-date=2015-06-13 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Badges and insignia vary widely across nations and services; though generally include some form of symbol specific to the individual chaplain's religion.

In addition to badges and insignias for individual chaplains, certain nations, including the United States, fly a [[Pennant (church)|Church or Worship Pennant]] during the time a chaplain leads a religious worship service, especially on ships at sea.  On United States Navy ships it is the only pennant that flies above the United States flag.

==Military chaplains by country==

===Argentina===

Roman Catholic military chaplains served in the Argentine armed forces since the early nineteenth century, and wore officers´ uniforms and ranks.
However, the use of these was discontinued in the 1970s in the Army and the Air Force, and in the 2000s in the Navy, due to allegations of some chaplains supposedly abusing their military position and thus discouraging their subordinates to approach them when in need. Nevertheless, chaplains continue to wear combat uniform (but no rank insignia) when accompanying the troops in field operations or exercises, and are still considered as a part of the officers corps.
No specific provisions exist for the spiritual support to non-Catholics.

===Australia===

====Army and Air Force====
[[File:Small box respirator.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An Australian chaplain wearing the "Large Box Respirator" also known as the "Respiratory Tower" during the First World War, Bois Grenier Sector on 5th June 1916.]]

{{See also|Royal Australian Army Chaplains' Department}}
Chaplains in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have almost the same status as chaplains in the British armed services. Chaplains in the [[Australian Army]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) are [[commissioned officers]] and wear the uniform of officers of their particular branch of the services as well as the rank to which they are qualified. Chaplains in the [[Australian Army]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] begin their commission as a Captain (Army) or Flight Lieutenant (RAAF) respectively. There are five levels or "divisions" for the seniority of chaplains in the Australian Army and Air Force with each division corresponding to a worn rank. The highest "division" is Division 5 who are "principal chaplains," of which there are three per service representing the three major Christian denominations: [[Catholic]], [[Anglican]] and [[Protestant]]. The principal chaplains of the Army wear the rank of brigadier and in the RAAF, air commodore. Australian Army chaplains, whatever their rank, are mostly referred to as "Padre" by officers and soldiers alike. The title is also widely used in the RAAF for their chaplains.

====Navy====
:''See: [[Royal Australian Navy#Chaplains]]''
Like chaplains in the [[Australian Army]] and RAAF, [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) chaplains are [[commissioned officers]] and wear the uniform of an RAN officer, but like chaplains in the British Royal Navy (RN) they do not wear a rank. Rather they wear the same cross and anchor emblem worn by RN chaplains on their shoulder rank slides and do not have gold braided rings or executive loops on their winter sleeve coat or summer shoulder boards. Like other chaplains in the ADF, Navy chaplains have five divisions of seniority. Whilst Australian Navy chaplains do not wear rank, they are accorded a certain rank for protocol and ceremonial occasions and for saluting purposes. Division 1, 2 and 3 Australian Navy chaplains are accorded the rank and status as [[Commander]] (Lieutenant Colonel equivalent in the Australian Army). Division 4 Australian Navy chaplains are accorded the rank and status of Captain (equiv. of Colonel). Division 5 Australian Navy chaplains are "principal chaplains," and these three chaplains, representing the three major Christian denominations: [[Catholic]], [[Anglican]] and [[Protestant]], are accorded the rank and status of [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]]. The title "Padre" for chaplains is less common and not officially encouraged in the Royal Australian Navy, although it is known to be used by some sailors and Navy chaplains in preference to the more formal title of "chaplain" or form of address towards an officer such as "sir." Like British Royal Navy chaplains, Royal Australian Navy chaplains wear a slightly different peaked cap to other Navy officers which apparently was designed by [[Winston Churchill]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

====Heads of denominations====
In the Australian Defence Force (ADF), the heads of military chaplaincy for those Christian denominations and of the Jewish faith that have an official association with the ADF, are also members of the ADF's "Religious Advisory Committee" (RAC). With respect to the [[Catholic]] and [[Anglican]] churches, their Bishops are members of RAC and they and the other members of RAC have the status of a two star General (US) or Major General (Australian Army), or Rear Admiral (RAN) or Air Vice-Marshal (RAAF).

The Anglican and Roman Catholic strands of Australian Defence Force Chaplaincy have websites that explain their church's mission within the Australian Defence Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceanglicans.org.au|title=Defence Anglicans - Home|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.catholic.org.au|title=Catholic Diocese of the Australian Defence Force|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Protestant strand does not have a website, one of their chaplains has a representative blog site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.padresponderings.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
Belgium has chaplains for its army, and is mainly a Catholic chaplaincy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.army-chaplaincy.be/befr/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

[[File:Aumôniers militaires de la Place de Strasbourg, juin 2013.jpg|thumb|right|upright|French military chaplains Jewish, Muslim and Catholic, Place de Strasbourg 2013]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], the cloak of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]] of Tours, (''cappa Sancti Martini''), one of the most sacred [[relic]]s of the Frankish kings, would be carried everywhere the king went, even into battle, as a holy relic upon which [[oath]]s were sworn. The clergyman who served as custodian for the cloak in its [[reliquary]] was called a ''capellānus'', and, by extension, all clergymen who officiated in reliquaries, sanctuaries, or chapels were eventually called ''cappellāni''. This eventually gave ''chapelain'' in Old French and was borrowed into English.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Henri Joseph Brahain Ducange|Ducange]], ''Glossarium'', s.v "Capella)", noted in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911, ''s.v.'' "Chapel".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] was the king who gave legal status to the military chaplains, since chaplains serving under their lord in the Crusades were the first to be militarized. In 1531, during the [[Battle of Kappel]], the Swiss reformist [[Huldrych Zwingli]] became the very first Protestant military chaplain to be killed on the battlefield.

The modern French ''Aumônerie militaire'' (military chaplaincy) was created and instituted by a July 8, 1880 Act of Parliament, which sets forth how the chaplaincy functions with regard to the Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish faiths. The Secularism Act (1905), which establishes a strict [[separation of church and state]] in the French government, does not however apply to the military. The defense minister appoints three command-level military chaplains—one per faith—in charge of all chaplains. The chaplains, serving in the army, are assigned by one of these three military chaplains. The first Muslim chaplain-general, Abdelkader Arbi, was commissioned in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/article/index.jsp?docId=2289423&amp;rubId=4078 |title=Ils sont les tout premiers aumôniers généraux musulmans |language=fr |publisher=La-Croix.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French military chaplains wear a uniform since [[World War II]], but have no rank or rank insignia. The modern military chaplaincy is rooted in that war, where military chaplains were incorporated in almost every [[Free French Forces]] fighting unit and made up of personnel from England, France, or any of its imperial domains. After the war, military chaplains were sent to occupation zones in Germany and Austria.

In the 1950s, military chaplains where sent in the [[French Union]]'s territories, including [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]]. In 1954, pastor Tissot was one of the last paratrooper volunteers to jump over the besieged [[Dien Bien Phu]] fortified camp in northern [[Vietnam]]. On May 7, he was made prisoner of the [[Viet Minh]] and sent to a re-education camp, deep in the jungle.

Since 1984, French military chaplains are involved in every military operation—including the [[Gulf War]]—from [[Rapid Reaction Force]] (''Force d'Action Rapide'') units to navy ships.

In [[France]], the existence of military chaplains has come under debate because of the separation of Church and State; however, their position has been maintained {{As of|2004|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ema/orgs_ext/aumoneries/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925085650/http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ema/orgs_ext/aumoneries/ |date=September 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially only Christian chaplains worked in German armies. Only after the [[French Revolution]] did Jews become citizens with equal rights in Germany for the first time. An integration of Jewish soldiers within the army gave the German Reich the opportunity to recognize the Jewish urge to fight for the German “Fatherland”. The times of common Christian suppression and supremachy status changed and more and more German Jews served in the liberal French Armies of the German territories under French influence, e.g. in the Bavarian army.

In Prussia, king [[Frederick the Great]] also showed religious tolerance, but in case of the Jews he exerted intolerance. The Jews were divided into six classes, and only the privileged first class had ''de facto'' equal rights as citizens. Very few Jewish soldiers in the Prussian army of the 18th century left historical traces, e.g. Konstantin Nathanel of Salomon, who was promoted to general in 1760. Although the Jewish presence in Germany is older than Christianity,&lt;ref name=bergerM&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Michael|title=Eisernes Kreuz und Davidstern : die Geschichte jüdischer Soldaten in deutschen Armeen|year=2006|publisher=Trafo|location=Berlin|isbn=3-89626-476-1|edition=1. Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first "field rabbinat" was introduced during World War I. The German Kaiserreich appointed c. 30 military rabbis. Field rabbi Dr. [[Leo Baeck]] wrote the “Israelite Field Prayer Book”.

====World War II====

Germany had a tradition of appointing Catholic and Evangelical military chaplains and Jewish military field rabbis. This was continued in the Army and Navy of the [[Wehrmacht]], for the Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations only. A total of 95% of all Germans being Christian, German soldiers during Nazi times continued to belong to the churches and had the words "Gott mit uns" (''God with us'') on the belt buckles of every Army and Navy enlisted men and non-commissioned officers.&lt;ref name=bergen2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="Susannah_Heschel_2008"/&gt; Despite this proportion of Christians, the totalitarian national socialistic government of the German Reich tried to weaken the authority and influence of the churches over their German adherents. Besides the international ''[[Jewish question]]'', the international character of the Catholic church was another challenge. A few Catholics who devoutly resisted the Nazis, suffered imprisonment and hardship. The case was solved by the [[Reichskonkordat]] (1933) between the [[Holy See]] and Nazi Germany. The government of the German Reich early established an pastoral ministry for the German Army and the Reichskonkordat settled the appointment of an Army bishop. Therefore, the military chaplains could more freely operate out of the Catholic hierarchy. [[Franz Justus Rarkowski]], [[Society of Mary (Marists)|S.M.]], became ordained the Catholic military Field Bishop (''Feldbischof'') of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938 until 1945.

German military chaplains who served the Wehrmacht were part of the German mainstream and lent the Nazi war effort legitimacy. The Christian military chaplains served between strange poles. While the Nazi ideology was at its core pagan (the elite [[SS]] units never allowed chaplains), 95% of Germans were baptized Christians. German soldiers during the Nazi era continued to belong to the churches and had the words "Gott mit uns" (''God with us'') on their belt buckles. “Being a chaplain in the German army had always been a prestigious position and the Nazis wanted people who represented that old military tradition (..) and not sow discord or division. They wanted people who were not troublemakers.2&lt;ref name=bergen2013/&gt; The German military chaplains mostly wanted to bring the word of the Christian God to men in the field and to deliver the sacraments, make their families proud and serve their country. “The motives of the chaplains were not unusual, (..) their noble, personal and professional motives turned them into a legitimating force in a war of annihilation.”&lt;ref name=bergen2013/&gt; Military chaplains in Nazi Germany were rigorously screened. First, names were put on the desks of the local civilian bishops, and then the names had to be approved by the according ministry for church affairs. Eventually the names were cleared by the military’s chaplaincy office and the [[Gestapo]] ("Secret State Police").&lt;ref name=bergen2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergen|first=Prof. Dr. Doris|title=German military chaplains caught between word of God and horror of man|url=http://life.nationalpost.com/2011/11/06/military-chaplains-caught-between-word-of-god-and-horror-of-man/|work=Holy Post|publisher=2013 National Post|accessdate=26 August 2013|display-authors=etal|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111107113447/http://life.nationalpost.com/2011/11/06/military-chaplains-caught-between-word-of-god-and-horror-of-man/|archive-date=2011-11-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bergen2&gt;{{cite web|last=BERGEN|first=Prof. Doris L.|title=German Military Chaplains in World War II and the Dilemmas of Legitimacy|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/German+Military+Chaplains+in+World+War+II+and+the+Dilemmas+of...-a076751697|publisher=2001 American Society of Church History|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Organization and clothing=====
Throughout the [[Third Reich]] period, only the Army and Navy had military chaplains. When needed, other branches of the armed forces acquired chaplains from the Army or Navy or from nearby parish. In the Heer (Army), military chaplains were organized into Group 3b (Pastoral Group) of the General Army Office under the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|Army High Command]]. In mid 1935, four groups of military chaplains were introduced. In 1936, similar groups were introduced for the [[Kriegsmarine]] although the evolution over time was different. The groups are as follow.&lt;ref name=hayden&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayden|first=Mark|title=German military chaplains in World War II|year=2005|publisher=Schiffer Pub.|location=Atglen, PA|isbn=9780764321566}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oberpfarrer''' (Higher Priest)
* '''Pfarrer''' (Priest)
* '''Standortpfarrer im Hauptamt''' (Garrison Priest in Main Office)
* '''Standortpfarrer im Nebenamt''' (Garrison Priest for Outside Appointment)

German military chaplains did not get into the ordinary military rank system, but received privileges like any other regular officers. Army chaplains had four different types of clothing:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Uniformen der Deutschen Wehrmacht: einschließlich Ausrüstung und Seitenwaffen|year=1939|publisher=Verlag Otto Dietrich|location=Berlin|isbn=3931533379}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Feldbluse''' (''Field Dress''). Field dress was identical for enlisted men, non-commissioned officers, and officers, and was worn on the battlefield. For military chaplains, the field dress was worn with officer-quality collar patches and without shoulder boards. Long trousers with shoes or breeches with officer boots could be worn. Two-pronged officer's belt was used.
* '''Dienstrock''' (''Service Dress''). Service dress was the typical dress for officers, with high quality materials and tailor made. For military chaplains, the field dress was worn with officer-quality collar patches and without shoulder boards. Service dress was normally used behind the lines although photographic evidences also show this kind of uniform was worn on the battlefield. Long trousers with shoes or breeches with officer boots could be worn. Two-pronged officer's belt was used, sometimes with cross strap.
* '''Überrock''' (''Frock Coat''). Frock coat was used for formal occasions and when ordered, and worn over the service dress. The piping was violet.
* '''Mantel''' (''Overcoat''). Overcoat worn by military chaplains was identical to those worn by officers. However, no shoulder boards were attached. This was worn over the field dress or service dress.

No weapon was permitted to be carried by chaplains, but one photographic evidence shows a chaplain with a pistol holster on his left waist.

For the headdresses of the Army chaplains, the most common were:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* '''Schirmmütze''' (''Visor Cap''). Officer-quality visor cap with violet as the branch color (''[[Waffenfarbe]]'') for military chaplains. Between the national eagle and cockade, there was a small Gothic cross, either made of metal or embroidered.
* '''Feldmütze''' (''Field Cap''). Officer-quality field cap with silver pipings and violet soutache as the ''Waffenfarbe''. Between the national eagle and cockade, there was a small Gothic cross, usually embroidered.

All the buttons, national eagles, cockades, Gothic crosses, and cap chinstraps were silver for military chaplains and gold for Field Bishops.
The collar patches had violet underlay and violet piping for Catholic chaplains, and field grey underlay and violet piping for Protestant (Evangelist) chaplains.

For the Kriegsmarine, the uniform was identical to naval jacket of regular officers, but without sleeve laces and with chaplain collar patches. The collar patches were different to those of the Army. Two-prong officer's belt or brocade belt could be worn.

Although the official regulation states that military chaplains had to wear golden [[pectoral cross]], there were two standard-issue crosses that were worn:&lt;ref name=hayden/&gt;
* For Catholic chaplains, [[Crucifix|Corpus Christi]] was present on the cross. The cross itself was made either of metal or silver, with black wood insert. Long metal chains went through a loop at the top of the cross to be worn around the neck.
* For Protestant (Evangelist) chaplains, the cross was plain and made of metal or silver. Long metal chains went through a loop at the top of the cross to be worn around the neck.

Photographic evidences show numerous variety of pectoral crosses worn by German military chaplains during World War II.

Oftentimes, German military chaplains were issued an armband with a red cross sign and violet stripe to show their neutrality on the battlefield. This was called ''Armbinde mit Neutralitätsabzeichen '' (Armband with Neutrality Sign).

Among other things, military chaplains also wore standard liturgical [[Vestment|vestments]] such as chasuble, cope, and stole.

German religious constitutional law and its state-church law is involved in the democratic national identity of modern Germany, especially in various articles of the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]]. Initially, a "military-chaplaincy" contract was only signed between the state and the Protestant Church, but was extended to all other religious communities for reasons of parity.&lt;ref name=pschnabel&gt;{{cite web|last=Schnabel|first=Patrick Roger|title=About the Relationship of State and Religion|url=http://fit-for-gender.org/downloads/P-Schnabel-Staat-Religion_eng.pdf|publisher=2007 fit-for-gender.org|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the 1930s '''Reichskonkordat''' between the Holy See and Germany is still in force. In Germany, military chaplains of the [[Bundeswehr]] have no rank but have a special civilian status as part of the armed forces.

The Military Rabbinate is a unit in the Israel Defense Forces that provides religious services for military personnel, Jewish and non-Jewish, and makes decisions on issues of religion and military affairs. The Military Rabbinate is headed by the Chief Military Rabbi, who carries the rank of a Brigadier General.

The Military Rabbinate constitutes the body responsible for religious institutions in the military. In every unit or military base there are Military Rabbinate military personnel assigned responsibility for conducting or coordinating religious services, overseeing the [[Kashrut|kosher operation]] of the kitchen, and the maintenance of the synagogue and religious supplies. Actively serving military personnel can request Military Rabbinate representatives to perform marriage ceremonies and [[Brit Milah|''brit mila'']], circumcision ceremonies, for babies. The unit also oversees the legal and religious certification of marriages and divorces of individuals during their military service.

The Military Rabbinate is responsible for treating the bodies of soldiers in accordance with religious law, including the identifications and post-mortem treatment of bodies, and conducting military funerals. The Military Rabbinate also coordinates the burial of enemy soldiers and the exhuming of bodies in conjunction with prisoner exchanges.

The Military Rabbinate was founded in 1948 by Rabbi Shlomo Goren, who headed it until 1968.

===The Netherlands===
The Netherlands has chaplains of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and humanist faiths, provided by the De Diensten Geestelijke Verzorging (DGV) or the Spiritual Care Services. Chaplains are trained in Vormingscentrum Landgoed Beukbergen.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.defensie.nl/onderwerpen/personeelszorg/geestelijke-verzorging&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fumanekile Gqiba.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Fumanekile Gqiba]], former Chaplain General of the S. African National Defense Force, and former South African Ambassador to Israel, 1998]]
Prior to 1968, chaplains wore badges of rank as [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniforminsignia.net/index.php?p=show&amp;id=42&amp;sid=1312 Rank Insignia – Army Land Forces: South Africa: Military Chaplains since 2002]. International Encyclopedia of Uniform Insignia Association. Retrieved 2010-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1968, however, all chaplains have been senior officers and accorded the protocol status of [[colonel]] / [[captain (navy)]]. They carry the military rank of [[chaplain]] and the rank insignia, which is unique to the Chaplains Service, comprises a [[Chi Rho]] monogramme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/carolrb/Christianity/christian_symbols.html |title=Christian Symbols |publisher=Atschool.eduweb.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723094739/http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/carolrb/christianity/christian_symbols.html |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded by a triangle. The monogramme represents the first two letters of Christ in [[Greek language|Greek]]. It originates from the days of [[Constantine I|Constantine]], the first [[Roman Emperor|Emperor of Rome]] to grant religious freedom to [[Christian]]s. His own conversion to the Christian faith was initiated by a dream in which the Chi-Rho monogramme appeared to him. The triangle surrounding the monogramme is the symbolic representation of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].

During the vision of the monogramme, Constantine [[Constantine I#War against Maxentius|heard the Latin words ''in hoc signo vinces'']]. The English translation of these [[Latin]] words is: "In this sign, you will conquer". This is the motto of the Chaplains Service and forms part of the [[Corps]] Badge.

In 1998, after working as chaplain general in exile for the ANC, the [[African National Congress]], during the fight against apartheid, [[Fumanekile Gqiba]] was appointed as the first black chaplain general for SANDF, the [[South African National Defense Force]]. In 2004, Major General Gqiba left the military to accept his appointment as South African Ambassador to Israel.

In the SANDF Chaplain Service, the [[Hindu]] faith is represented by a Regular Force chaplain. The rank is Cpln (Vipra) and the mode of address Vipra. The rank insignia is a deepa (lamp) with flame. This is the symbolic representation of enlightenment, the life objective of all Hindus.

The [[Muslim]]s do not have Regular Force chaplains in the SANDF because they are small in number. They are however served by part-time workers through the Chaplains Service of the SANDF and are addressed according to their religious customs as [[imam]]s.

Christian chaplains are generally referred to and addressed as Padre. They may however, be addressed according to the practice of their religious bodies e.g., Father, [[Pastor]], Umfundisi ([[Zulu people|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]), Moruti ([[Sotho people|Sotho]]), Dominee ([[Afrikaans]]) etc. The official written form of address is ''Cpln'' (for chaplain) followed by the appropriate ecclesiastical title of the respective chaplain e.g., Cpln (Rev), Cpln (Fr), Cpln (Pastor), Cpln, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chaplain.mil.za/aboutus/about_us.htm |title=SANDF |publisher=Chaplain.mil.za |date=2007-01-23 |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202091248/http://www.chaplain.mil.za/aboutus/about_us.htm |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with chaplains from many other nations in the southern region of the continent of Africa, South African chaplains participate in SARMCA, the ''South Africa Regional Military Chaplains Association'', which is a component organization of SADC, the ''[[Southern African Development Community]]''.

[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 B10582.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Father C. V. Murphy carries out [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in a Dutch field in the front line, 6 October 1944.]]
The first [[England|English]] military-oriented chaplains were priests on board proto-naval vessels during the eighth century AD. Land based chaplains appeared during the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]], although their duties included jobs that today would come under the jurisdiction of [[military engineer]]s and [[medical]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]]. A priest attached to a feudal noble household would follow his [[Feudalism|liege]] lord into battle. In 1796 the Parliament of [[Great Britain]] passed a [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] that established the [[Army Chaplains' Department]] in the [[British Army]]. The Department was awarded its "Royal" prefix in 1919 in recognition of their chaplains' service during World War I.

The current form of military chaplain dates from the era of the [[World War I|First World War]]. A chaplain provides spiritual and pastoral support for service personnel, including the conduct of religious services at sea or in the field. In the Royal Navy chaplains are traditionally addressed by their Christian name, or with one of many nicknames (Bish; Sin-Bosun; Devil Dodger; Sky-Pilot etc.). In the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]], chaplains are traditionally referred to (and addressed) as ''padre'' or as Sir/Ma'am (although not the latter in the RAF).

In the [[Royal Navy]] chaplains have no rank other than "chaplain" while in the [[British Army]] they hold commissioned relative rank but are universally referred to as Padre.  On the foundation of the [[Royal Air Force]] Chaplains' Branch an attempt was made to amalgamate these differing systems creating "Relative Rank", where rank is worn but without executive authority. In practice chaplains of all three services work in similar ways using what influence and authority they have on behalf of those who consult them or seek their advice.

During World War II the head of chaplaincy in the British Army was an ([[Anglican]]) [[chaplain-general]], (a [[major-general]]), who was formally under the control of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State.&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Symons, Chaplain-General to the Forces&lt;/ref&gt; An assistant chaplain-general was a chaplain 1st class (full [[colonel]]) and a senior chaplain was a chaplain 2nd class ([[lieutenant colonel]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brumwell, P. Middleton (1943) ''The Army Chaplain: the Royal Army Chaplains' Department; the duties of chaplains and morale''. London: Adam &amp; Charles Black&lt;/ref&gt;

All chaplains are [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]] and wear uniform. [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]] chaplains bear ranks and wear rank insignia, but [[Royal Navy]] chaplains do not, wearing a cross and a special version of the officers' [[cap badge]] as their only insignia.

Chaplains in the armed forces were previously all [[Christianity|Christian]] or [[Judaism|Jewish]]. The first Jewish chaplain was appointed in 1892 and some 20 to 30 were commissioned during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Phil Groom |url=http://www.ccj-hillingdon.org.uk/news.htm |title=Military Chaplaincy, Christian and Jewish perspectives, November 2005 |publisher=Ccj-hillingdon.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625042626/http://ccj-hillingdon.org.uk/news.htm |archivedate=2014-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recent times, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) has employed only Christian chaplains, with the Jewish community providing an honorary chaplain under long-standing arrangements, although Jewish chaplains have served in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. In October 2005 the Ministry of Defence appointed four chaplains to the military; one each from the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Islam|Muslim]] and [[Sikhism|Sikh]] faith communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4355896.stm | work=BBC News | title=Non-Christian chaplains appointed | date=2005-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Museum of Army Chaplaincy]] holds information and archive material relating to the history of the [[RAChD|Army Chaplains' Department.]]

In the [[United States]], military chaplains have an officer's rank based on their years of service and promotion selection from among their peers. Chaplains serving in the US Armed Forces wear the uniform of their respective branch of service, and normally wear clerical attire only during the performance of a religious service. The position of rank and chaplain faith group insignia [[Religious symbolism in the United States military|varies in each military department]] and may vary significantly from one type of uniform to another within a military department.

The [[Civil Air Patrol]], the volunteer Auxiliary of the USAF, also has chaplains, who must meet the same standards for appointment as active-duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard chaplains.

US military chaplains, both individuals and in groups, have been involved in a number of controversies. Complaints have been made against chaplains for mandatory prayers, coercion, and using government money to promote Evangelical Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armytimes.com/news/2008/09/airforce_lakenheath_suit_093008/ LaGrone, S.

The [[United States military chaplains#Constitutionality|constitutionality of the US chaplaincy]] has been the subject of legal challenges and scholarly dispute. One appellate case, ''Katcoff v. Marsh'' (1985) upheld the system as a permissible attempt to support service members in the "free exercise" of their religious beliefs, though others have described the details of the chaplaincy system as violations of the legal principles that the federal government maintain neutrality and avoid becoming entangled in religious affairs.

The murder of '''Jeannette DePalma''' (August 3, 1956 – c. August 7, 1972) is believed to have occurred sometime on or around August 7, 1972 in [[Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey|Springfield Township, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="coffee"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coffeehouse Aides Discount Murder Tie-In|publisher=The Elizabeth Daily Journal|date=October 3, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case, currently unsolved, has become a matter of significant controversy due, in part, to coverage in ''[[Weird NJ]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Haunt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Haunting Tales Told in County|agency=The Union County Local Source|date=October 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hist"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unsolved Case of Jeannette DePalma|url=http://weirdnj.com/stories/mystery-history/jeannette-depalma/|website=Weird NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hudson" /&gt;

==Discovery of the body==
On the afternoon of Monday, August 7, 1972, 16-year-old Jeannette DePalma left her home on Clearview Road in [[Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey|Springfield Township, New Jersey]], telling her mother that she was going to take a train to a friend's house.&lt;ref name="Haunt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weird NJ, Issue #22"&gt;{{cite book|title=Weird NJ, Issue #22|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she did not arrive at her friend's home or return later that evening, her parents filed a [[missing person]] report with the Springfield Police Department.

Six weeks later, on September 19 her remains were found atop a cliff inside of Springfield's [[Houdaille Quarry]]. This occurred after a local dog brought her decomposing right forearm and hand back to its owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Find Body Atop Cliff|agency=The Elizabeth Daily Journal|date=September 20, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Springfield Cops Find Girl's Body"&gt;{{cite news|title=Springfield Cops Find Girl's Body|agency=The Star-Ledger|date=September 21, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WeirdNJ81" /&gt;

According to several witnesses at the scene, Jeannette's skeletal remains were surrounded by a series of strange and possibly [[Occult#occultism|occult]] objects.&lt;ref name="coffee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hist" /&gt; Descriptions vary, but the most commonly agreed upon account states that the remains were found inside a coffin-shaped perimeter of fallen branches and logs, and inside this perimeter were several small makeshift wooden crosses.&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;{{cite news|title=Murder Probe Sheds Light on Witchcraft Cult|agency=The Star-Ledger|date=October 8, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="priest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Priest's Theory: Devil's Disciples Killed Girl|agency=The New York Daily News|date=October 4, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Girl Sacrificed in Witch Rite"&gt;{{cite news|title=Girl Sacrificed in Witch Rite?|agency=The Elizabeth Daily Journal|date=September 29, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Weird NJ, Issue #22|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, some Springfield residents claimed that DePalma's remains were actually found lying on a [[pentagram]], surrounded by mutilated animal remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Weird NJ, Issue #22|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement authorities have denied that this was true. Further controversy was aroused when it was discovered that the body had been found on a cliff known to locals for several decades as "The Devil's Teeth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Weird NJ, Issue #22|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hudson" /&gt;

==Investigation==
The Springfield Police Department began an investigation of Jeannette DePalma's death after an autopsy did not reveal a cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dead Girl in N.J. May Have Been Strangled|agency=Bucks County Courier Times|date=September 21, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haunt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weird NJ, Issue #22"/&gt;

Her remains and clothing showed no evidence of bone fractures, bullet wounds, or knife strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Weird NJ Volume 2|publisher=Sterling|isbn=978-1-4027-3941-5|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; No drug paraphernalia was found on or around the body. For undisclosed reasons, the coroner suspected that strangulation was the cause of death,&lt;ref name="Springfield Cops Find Girl's Body"/&gt; leading the [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] Prosecutor's Office to treat the case as an unsolved homicide. The coroner also discovered an unusually high amount of [[lead]] in the remains, but no explanation was found for this occurrence either.&lt;ref name="Weird NJ, Issue #22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Weird NJ Volume 2|publisher=Sterling|isbn=978-1-4027-3941-5|pages=81, 82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the investigation, the Springfield Police Department received a tip regarding a homeless man living in the woods near the place where the body was found. This man was known to locals simply as "Red", and it was alleged that he fled his campsite in the woods shortly after DePalma went missing. While this lead initially looked promising, the Union County Prosecutor's Office ultimately decided that "Red" had nothing to do with Jeannette's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Death on the Devil's Teeth: The Strange Murder That Shocked Suburban New Jersey|publisher=The History Press|isbn=1626196281|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators continued to attempt to find leads, but due to the DePalma family's private nature, along with inconsistent stories told by her friends and peers, the case eventually went cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Glen Jones Radio Programme featuring X. Ray Burns, July 13, 2014|url=http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/56436|website=WFMU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of human sacrifice==
Around two weeks after the discovery of DePalma's remains, several newspapers, including the ''[[The Star-Ledger|Star-Ledger]]'' and the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', began reporting that she may have been the victim of an occult sacrifice&lt;ref name="priest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite news|title='Witchcraft' Implicated in DePalma Murder|agency=The Star-Ledger|date=October 3, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; carried out either by [[Satanists]] or by a local [[Coven|coven of witches]] who operated inside nearby [[Watchung Reservation]].&lt;ref name="Weird NJ, Issue #22"/&gt;

This coverage was spurred by reports that the body had been found surrounded by strange objects, and by the theories of the DePalma family's [[Evangelical]] pastor, James Tate of the Assemblies of God Evangel Church.&lt;ref name="Star" /&gt;&lt;ref name="priest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Rumors about the case set off a panic in several [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] communities, which were still recovering from the shock of the [[John List]] murders, which had occurred only 10 months earlier.&lt;ref name="Girl Sacrificed in Witch Rite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haunt" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, ''Weird NJ'' magazine began to report on the decades-old cold case after receiving several anonymous letters regarding Jeannette's death.&lt;ref name="WeirdNJ81"&gt;{{cite book|title=Weird NJ, Issue #20|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Editor and co-founder [[Mark Moran (writer)|Mark Moran]] began investigating the case and wrote about many purportedly suspicious details, including the allegation that the Springfield Police Department had lost or destroyed the case file.

The Springfield Police Department maintains that the file was lost due to flooding caused by [[Hurricane Floyd]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="WeirdNJ81" /&gt; Others allege that a copy of it is still on file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Weird NJ, Issue #22|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moran eventually teamed up with ''Weird NJ'' correspondent Jesse P. Pollack to write the book ''Death on the Devil's Teeth: The Strange Murder That Shocked Suburban New Jersey''.&lt;ref name="Hudson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conspiracy or serial killer? Two theories offered on unsolved 1974 murder of NB teens|url=http://hudsonreporter.com/view/full_story/26402295/article-Conspiracy--or-serial-killer----Two-theories-offered-on-unsolved-1974-murder-of-NB-teens-?instance=north_bergen|website=The Hudson Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death on the Devil's Teeth: The Strange Murder That Shocked Suburban New Jersey|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1626196281|website=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the course of their research, Pollack and Moran discovered several instances of a possible cover-up, connections to other unsolved murders, and previously unknown suspects.&lt;ref name="Hudson" /&gt;

The '''naga morsarang''', also known as '''sahan''', is a container which is used to store magic ritual potions in the culture of [[Toba people]] of [[North Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. The naga morsarang is created out of the horn of the [[water buffalo]]. 

==Description==
Naga morsarang is one of several types of container in which the ''datu'' (Batak people's ritual specialist) kept a supernaturally powerful potion. The naga morsarang is made of horn of a [[water buffalo]]. A large naga morsarang vessel measures {{convert|20.5|inch|cm}} long and {{convert|10.25|inch|cm}} wide. As a container of a powerful potion, the naga morsarang is extensively decorated with complex patterns. The outer surface is incised thoroughly with complex designs. The pointed end of the horn is carved into the shape of a seated figure of a man, or sometimes more. The opening of the horn is plugged with a wooden stopper. This wooden stopper is always shaped into a figure of the [[Singa (mythology)|singa]], a [[Nāga|Naga]]-like underground figures. Many additional figures are sometimes carved as mounting the singa e.g. the lizard [[Boraspati ni Tano]], a human figure, or several human figures. These human figures may represent the ''datu'', owner of the naga morsarang, and the former ''datu''s, former owners of the naga morsarang. Others think that these figures represent characters from Batak mythology.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/315889 |title=Container for Magical Substances (Naga Morsarang) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018 |website=Met Museum |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art. All rights reserved. |access-date=July 1, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A figure of a lizard, which represents the earth deity [[Boraspati ni Tano]], is sometimes carved inside the hollow of the horn.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;

==Potions==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Toverhoorn voor de opslag van pupuk TMnr 137-599.jpg|thumb|left|A naga morsarang]]
[[Toba people]] believed that the spirits of the dead were able to influence the fate of the living. To gain favor from the spirits, the Toba performed elaborate rituals or sacrifices with the help of the datu, a male ritual specialist  who acted as intermediaries between the human and supernatural world. The datu created magic books known as the [[pustaha]] which was used by him and by his disciples as a reference for his magic rituals. Among the contents of the pustaha are methods to create different kind of potions used for both [[white magic]] and [[black magic]] in a kind of complex magic ritual. Naga morsarang are used as container for these potions.{{sfn|Kozok|2009|pp=44-5}} 

One example of a white magic potion is the ''pagar'', a potion used as a kind of amulet to protect from evil. The creation of ''pagar'' is very difficult, and can only be done on certain auspicious days. Most of the ingredients of a ''pagar'' are derived from plants, although sometimes chicken head, its entrails, and its feathers are included in the mixture. The ingredients for a ''pagar'' can only be gathered on certain sacred sites known as the ''sombaon''. Creation of a pagar took days or weeks. All the ingredients are then cooked and finely crushed into a kind of paste which is then stored in the naga morsarang.{{sfn|Kozok|2009|pp=44-5}}

==Similar vessel==
The [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo]] version of the vessel known as ''perminaken/parminaken'' or ''guri-guri''. Instead of strictly a bull's horn, the ''perminaken'' may use other types of material for the vessel e.g. a bamboo, a gourd, or even a Ming period jar imported from China.{{sfn|Bonatz|Miksic|Neidel|2009|p=139}} The ''perminaken'' similarly use a wooden stopper with carvings of a figure of the [[singa (mythology)|singa]], a person, or a person riding the singa.{{sfn|Sitepu|1980|p=45}}

A '''Natin''' ({{lang-he|נתין}}) is an alleged descendant of the [[Gibeonites]]. In [[Judaism]], special regulations apply to such people; they are not, for example, traditionally permitted to marry ordinary [[Jews]] ([[Yebamot]], 8:3). For more information, see also [[Nethinim]].

'''Our Lady of Guadalupe''' ({{lang-es|Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe}}), also known as the '''Virgin of Guadalupe''' ({{lang-es|Virgen de Guadalupe}}), is a Catholic title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] associated with a venerated image enshrined within the Minor [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in [[Mexico City]]. The basilica is the most visited Catholic pilgrimage site in the world, and the world's third most-visited sacred site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/worlds-most-visited-sacred-sites "World's Most-Visited Sacred Sites", ''Travel and Leisure'', January 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/ZSHRINE.HTM "Shrine of Guadalupe Most Popular in the World", ''Zenit'', June 13, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Leo XIII]] granted  the venerated image  a [[Canonical Coronation]] on 12 October 1895.
== Marian apparitions ==
Official [[Catholic]] accounts state that [[Marian apparitions|the Virgin Mary appeared]] four times before [[Juan Diego]] and once more before Juan Diego's uncle. According to these accounts the first apparition occurred on the morning of December 9, 1531, when it is said that a native Mexican peasant named Juan Diego experienced a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of a young woman at a place called the Hill of [[Tepeyac]], which would become part of [[Villa de Guadalupe, Mexico City|Villa de Guadalupe]], a suburb of [[Mexico City]]. Speaking to Juan Diego in his native [[Nahuatl]] language (the language of the [[Aztec empire]]), the woman identified herself as the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], "mother of the very true deity"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sousa |first=Lisa|authorlink=Lisa Sousa |author2=[[Stafford Poole]]; [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] (trans. and trans.) |year=1998 |title=The Story of Guadalupe: Luis Laso de la Vega's ''Huei tlamahuiçoltica'' of 1649 |series=UCLA Latin American studies, vol. 84; Nahuatl studies series, no. 5 |location=Stanford &amp; Los Angeles, California|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Latin American Center Publications|isbn=0-8047-3482-8 |oclc=39455844|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}} p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and asked for a church to be built at that site in her honor.
 
Based on her words, Juan Diego then sought out the archbishop of Mexico City, Fray [[Juan de Zumárraga]], to tell him what had happened. Not unexpected the bishop did not believe Diego, on the same day, Juan Diego saw the Virgin Mary for a second time (the second apparition); she asked him to keep insisting.

On Sunday, December 10, Juan Diego talked to the archbishop for a second time. The latter instructed him to return to Tepeyac Hill, and ask the lady for a miraculous sign to prove her identity. That same day, the third apparition occurred when Diego returned to Tepeyac and encountering the Virgin Mary, reported the bishop's request for a sign; she consented to provide one on the following day (December 11).&lt;ref&gt;This apparition is somewhat elided in the ''Nican Mopohua'' but is implicit in three brief passages (Sousa ''et al''., pp. 75, 77, 83).  It is fully described in the ''Imagen de la Virgen María'' of Miguel Sánchez published in 1648.&lt;/ref&gt;

By Monday, December 11, however, Juan Diego's uncle Juan Bernardino had fallen sick and Juan Diego was obliged to attend to him. In the very early hours of Tuesday, December 12, Juan Bernardino's condition having deteriorated overnight, Juan Diego set out to [[Tlatelolco, Mexico City|Tlatelolco]] to fetch a priest to hear Juan Bernardino's confession and minister to him on his death-bed.

[[File:Dibujo Escudo de Armas de México.jpg|thumb|left|Preliminary drawing of the Mexican Coat of arms, ca. 1743]]
In order to avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on the Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around the hill, but the Virgin intercepted him and asked where he was going (fourth apparition); Juan Diego explained what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having had recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe event and are inscribed over the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked, “¿No estoy yo aquí que soy tu madre?” (Am I not here, I who am your mother?). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and she told him to gather flowers from the top of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in the cold of December. Juan followed her instructions and he found [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there. The Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan's ''[[Tilmàtli|tilma]]'', or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak before archbishop Zumárraga on December 12, the flowers fell to the floor, and on the fabric was the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.&lt;ref&gt;English translation of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071022042328/http://www.interlupe.com.mx/nican-e.html ''Nican Mopohua''], a 17th-century account written in the native Nahuatl language.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, on December 13, Juan Diego found his uncle fully recovered, as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted that he too had seen her, at his bed-side (fifth apparition); that she had instructed him to inform the bishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; and that she had told him she desired to be known under the title of Guadalupe.

The bishop kept Juan Diego's mantle first in his private chapel and then in the church on public display where it attracted great attention. On December 26, 1531 a procession formed for taking the miraculous image back to Tepeyac where it was installed in a small hastily erected [[chapel]].&lt;ref&gt;The date does not appear in the ''Nican Mopohua'', but in Sanchez's ''Imagen''.&lt;/ref&gt; In course of this procession, the first miracle was allegedly performed when an Indian was mortally wounded in the neck by an arrow shot by accident during some stylized martial displays executed in honour of the Virgin. In great distress, the Indians carried him before the Virgin's image and pleaded for his life. Upon the arrow being withdrawn, the victim made a full and immediate recovery.&lt;ref&gt;The procession and miracle are not part of the ''Nican Mopohua'' proper, but introduce the ''Nican Mopectana'' which immediately follows the ''Nican Mopohua'' in the ''Huei tlamahuiçoltica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan Diego's tilma has become Mexico's most popular religious and cultural symbol, and has received widespread ecclesiastical and popular support. In the 19th century it became the rallying call of American-born Spaniards in New Spain, who saw the story of the apparition as legitimizing their own Mexican origin and infusing it with an almost messianic sense of mission and identity – thus also legitimizing their armed rebellion against Spain.&lt;ref name = "Poole"&gt;Poole, Stafford. ''Our Lady of Guadalupe: The Origins and Sources of a Mexican National Symbol, 1531–1797'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Taylor"&gt;Taylor, William B., ''Shrines and Miraculous Images: Religious Life in Mexico Before the Reforma'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe did not lack significant clerical opposition within Mexico and elsewhere, especially in the early years, and in more recent times some Catholic scholars, and even a former abbot of the basilica, [[Guillermo Schulenburg|Monsignor Guillermo Schulenburg]], have openly doubted the historical existence of Juan Diego, referring to the devotion as merely symbolic, propagated by a sensational [[cult]] looking to bolster Catholic devotion from amongst the indigenous. Nonetheless, Juan Diego was canonized in 2002, under the name Saint Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin.

While the image garners much religious devotion and fervent Mexican patriotism, scholarly criticism on the image is also notable, considering the artistic disproportion of the image, the similarity of the image to Spanish pre-colonial artwork closely related to the Aztec colony at the time, the alleged relationship of [[Marcos Cipac de Aquino]] in either inventing or amending the tilma cloak, and the public declaration of the abbot of the Guadalupe shrine pertaining to the false existence of the Marian apparitions.

Note the similarity of the [[aureola]] and [[cherub]] underneath the Virgin.]]

Following the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]] in 1519–21, the Spanish destroyed a temple of the [[mother goddess]] [[Tonantzin]] at [[Tepeyac]] outside Mexico City, and built a chapel dedicated to the Virgin on the site. Tonantzin (the beloved mother of the gods) was celebrated each [[winter solstice]]&lt;ref name="Mansueto"&gt; Mansueto, Anthony E.,

What is purported by some to be the earliest mention of the miraculous apparition of the Virgin is a page of parchment (the ''[[Codex Escalada]]'') which was discovered in 1995 and, according to investigative analysis, dates from the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Castaño, Victor Manuel: coordinador general, "Estudio físico-químico y técnico del códice 1548", Colección Privada Herdez (1997); ''Ciencia Hoy'', "La detectivesca ciencia de los documentos antiguos: el caso de códice 1548", (a) 29 April, (b) 6 May, and (c) 13 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This document bears two pictorial representations of Juan Diego and the apparition, several inscriptions in [[Nahuatl]] referring to Juan Diego by his Aztec name, and the date of his death: 1548, as well as the year that the Virgin Mary appeared: 1531. It also contains the [[glyph]] of [[Antonio Valeriano]]; and finally, the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahagun that was authenticated by experts from the [[Banco de Mexico]] and [[Charles E. Dibble]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://basilica.mxv.mx/web1/-apariciones/Documentos_Historicos/Mestizos/Codice_1548.html Códice 1548 o "Escalada"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nican-mopohua.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|[[Nican mopohua]].]]
A more complete early description of the apparition occurs in a 16-page manuscript called the ''[[Nican mopohua]]'', which was acquired by the New York Public Library in 1880, and has been reliably dated in 1556. This document, written in Nahuatl, but in Latin script, tells the story of the apparitions and the supernatural origin of the image. It was probably composed by a native Aztec man, called Antonio Valeriano, who had been educated by Franciscans. The text of this document was later incorporated into a printed pamphlet which was widely circulated in 1649.&lt;ref name = "Brading"/&gt;&lt;ref name="leon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burrus S. J. 1981"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Oldest Copy of the Nican Mopohua |first=Ernest J. |last=Burrus S.

In spite of these documents, there are no written accounts of the Guadalupe vision by Catholic clergymen of the 16th century, as there ought to have been if the event had the importance it is claimed to have had.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ricard, ''The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico''. Translated by Lesley Byrd Simpson. Berkeley: University of California Press 1966, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the canonical account of the vision features archbishop [[Juan de Zumárraga]] as a major player in the story, but, although Zumárraga was a prolific writer, there is nothing in his extant writings that can confirm the story.

The written record that does exist suggests the Catholic clergy in 16th century Mexico were deeply divided as to the orthodoxy of the cult springing up around the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, with the [[Franciscan order]] (who had custody of the chapel at Tepeyac) being strongly opposed to the cult, while the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] supported it.&lt;ref&gt;Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main promoter of the cult was the Dominican [[Alonso de Montúfar]], who succeeded the Franciscan Juan de Zumárraga as archbishop of Mexico. In a 1556 sermon Montúfar commended popular devotion to "Our Lady of Guadalupe," referring to a painting on cloth (a tilma) in the chapel of the Virgin Mary at Tepeyac, where certain miracles had occurred. Days later, Fray Francisco de Bustamante, local head of the Franciscan order, delivered a sermon denouncing the cult. He expressed concern that the Archbishop was promoting a superstitious regard for an image:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The devotion at the chapel...to which they have given the name Guadalupe was prejudicial to the Indians because they believed that the image itself worked miracles, contrary to what the missionary friars had been teaching them, and because many were disappointed when it did not."{{sfn|Poole, p. 60}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Estandarte de Cortes en anno 1521.jpeg|thumbnail|The banner of conquistador [[Hernan Cortes]] from year 1521, which remained within the Archbishop's villa during the time of the Guadalupe apparitions, allegedly serving as inspiration for [[Marcos Cipac de Aquino]]'s invention of the image. Note the disproportionate, uncentered hairline and separated [[little finger]].]]
The next day Archbishop Montúfar opened an inquiry into the matter. At the inquiry, the Franciscans repeated their position that the image encouraged idolatry and superstition, and four witnesses testified to Bustamante's claim that the image was painted by an Indian, with one witness naming him "the Indian painter Marcos".{{sfn|Poole, pp. 60–62}} This could refer to the Aztec painter [[Marcos Cipac de Aquino]], who was active at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4201|number=201|date=13 April 2010|title=The Virgin of Guadalupe|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Nickell, "Image of Guadalupe: myth – perception". ''Skeptical Inquirer'' 21:1 (January/ February 1997), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; But "if he did, he did so without making a preliminary sketch – in itself a near-miraculous procedure.[...] Cipac may well have had a hand in painting the Image, but only in painting the additions, such as the angel and moon at the Virgin's feet",&lt;ref&gt;Jody Brant Smith, The image of Guadalupe, Mercer University Press, 1994, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; claims Prof. Jody Brant Smith (referring to Philip Serna Callahan's examination of the tilma using infrared photography in 1979).

Ultimately Archbishop Montúfar (himself a Dominican) decided to end Franciscan custody of the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Johnston, ''The Wonder of Guadalupe,'' TAN Books, 1981, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; From then on the shrine was served by diocesan priests under the authority of the archbishop.&lt;ref&gt;Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Archbishop Montúfar authorized the construction of a much larger church at Tepeyac, in which the tilma was mounted and displayed.

The report of this 1556 inquiry is the most extensive documentation concerning the Virgin of Guadalupe from the 16th century, and significantly, it makes no mention of Juan Diego, the miraculous apparition, or any other element from the legend.

In the late 1570s, the Franciscan historian [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] denounced the cult at Tepeyac and the use of the name "Tonantzin" to call Our Lady in a personal digression in his ''General History of the Things of New Spain'', in the version known as the [[Florentine Codex]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;At this place [Tepeyac], [the Indians] had a temple dedicated to the mother of the gods, whom they called Tonantzin, which means Our Mother. There they performed many sacrifices in honor of this goddess...And now that a church of Our Lady of Guadalupe is built there, they also call her Tonantzin, being motivated by the preachers who called Our Lady, the Mother of God, Tonantzin.  It is not known for certain where the beginning of this Tonantzin may have originated, but this we know for certain, that, from its first usage, the word means that ancient Tonantzin. And it is something that should be remedied, for the correct [native] name of the Mother of God, Holy Mary, is not Tonantzin, but ''Dios inantzin''. It appears to be a Satanic invention to cloak idolatry under the confusion of this name, Tonantzin.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardino de Sahagún, ''Florentine Codex: Introduction and Indices'', Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble, translators. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1982, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sahagún's criticism of the cult seems to have stemmed primarily from his concern about a [[syncretism|syncretistic]] application of the native name ''Tonantzin'' to the Virgin Mary. However, Sahagún often used the same name in his sermons as late as the 1560s.&lt;ref&gt;L. Burkhart (2001). ''Before Guadalupe: the Virgin Mary in early colonial Nahuatl literature.'' Austin: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century and probably continuing into the early 17th century, the image was modified by adding the [[mandorla]]-shaped sunburst around the Virgin, the stars on her cloak, the moon under her feet, and the angel with folded cloth supporting her—as was determined by an infrared and ocular study of the tilma in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;P. Callahan (1981). ''The Tilma under Infrared Radiation: CARA Studies in Popular Devotion, vol. II, Guadalupe Studies, n° 3''. Washington D.C.: Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, pp. 6–13, esp. conclusions at pp. 9, 10, 13; summary conclusions 2 and 3 at p. 18; and speculations at p. 19 as to the circumstances in which the additions were made&lt;/ref&gt;

===First printed accounts ===
[[File:Virgin of Guadalupe - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|''Virgin of Guadalupe'' circa 1700s featuring a novelty crown on the Virgin's head, later removed on 23 February 1888]]
One of the first printed accounts of the history of the apparitions and image occurs in ''[[Image of the Virgin Mary Mother of God of Guadalupe|Imagen de la Virgen Maria, Madre de Dios de Guadalupe]]'', published in 1648 by [[Miguel Sánchez]], a diocesan priest of Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sCBtj0462_sC&amp;dq=Brading,+D.+A.+%282001%29.+Mexican+Phoenix:&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CGA4TPWMGM2HkAWsnI3AAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false D. A. Brading, ''Mexican Phoenix: Our Lady of Guadalupe''], (Cambridge University Press, 2001) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Another account is the [[Codex Escalada]], dating from the sixteenth century, a sheet of parchment recording apparitions of the Virgin Mary and the figure of Juan Diego, which reproduces the [[glyph]] of Antonio Valeriano alongside the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahagún. It also contains the following glosses: "1548 Also in that year of 1531 appeared to Cuahtlatoatzin our beloved mother the Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico. Cuahtlatoatzin died worthily"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insigne y Nacional Basílica de Santa María de Guadalupe|url=http://basilica.mxv.mx/web1/-apariciones/Documentos_Historicos/Mestizos/Codice_1548.html|website=basilica.mxv.mx|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next printed account was a 36-page tract in the Nahuatl language, ''[[Huei tlamahuiçoltica]]'' ("The Great Event"), which was published in 1649. This tract contains a section called the ''[[Nican mopohua]]'' ("Here it is recounted"), which we have already touched on above. The composition and authorship of the ''Huei tlamahuiçoltica'' is assigned by a majority of scholars to [[Luis Laso de la Vega]], vicar of the sanctuary of Tepeyac from 1647–1657.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sousa |first=Lisa |authorlink=Lisa Sousa |author2=[[Stafford Poole]]; [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] (trans. and trans.) |year=1998 |title=The Story of Guadalupe: Luis Laso de la Vega's ''Huei tlamahuiçoltica'' of 1649 |series=UCLA Latin American studies, vol. 84; Nahuatl studies series, no. 5 |location=Stanford &amp; Los Angeles, California|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Latin American Center Publications|isbn=0-8047-3482-8 |oclc=39455844|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}} pp. 42–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of Guadalupe: Luis Laso de la Vega's Huei tlamahuiçoltica of 1649.''

Nevertheless, the most important section of the tract, the ''[[Nican Mopohua]]'', appears to be much older. It has been attributed since the late 1600s to [[Antonio Valeriano]] (ca. 1531–1605), a native Aztec man who had been educated by the Franciscans and who collaborated extensively with [[Bernardino de Sahagún]].&lt;ref name = "Brading"&gt;D.

appears to be datable to the mid-1500s, and may have been the original work by Valeriano that was used by Laso in composing the ''Huei tlamahuiçoltica''. Most authorities agree on the dating and on Valeriano's authorship.&lt;ref name="leon"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tonantzin Guadalupe : pensamiento náhuatl y mensaje cristiano en el "Nicān mopōhua" |first=Miguel |last=León-Portilla |author2=Antonio Valeriano |publisher=Colegio Nacional: Fondo de Cultura Económico |location=Mexico |year=2000 |language=Spanish |isbn=968-16-6209-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burrus S.

On the other hand, in 1666, the scholar [[Luis Becerra Tanco]] published in Mexico a book about the history of the apparitions under the name "Origen milagroso del santuario de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe," which was republished in Spain in 1675 as "Felicidad de Mexico en la admirable aparición de la virgen María de Guadalupe y origen de su milagrosa Imagen, que se venera extramuros de aquella ciudad."&lt;ref&gt;Brading, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, in 1688, Jesuit Father Francisco de Florencia published "La Estrella del Norte de México" with the history of the same apparitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Treviño|first1=Eduardo Chávez ; translated from Spanish by Carmen|last2=Montaño|first2=Veronica|title=Our Lady of Guadalupe and Saint Juan Diego : the historical evidence|date=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0742551059|page=121 of 212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two separate accounts, one in Nahuatl from Juan Bautista del Barrio de San Juan from the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;Anales de Juan Bautista Folio 6r&lt;/ref&gt; and the other in Spanish by [[Servando Teresa de Mier]]&lt;ref&gt;Cartas Sobre la Tradición de Ntra. Sra. de Guadalupe de México, Servando Teresa De Mier 1797 p 53&lt;/ref&gt; date the original apparition and native celebration on September 8 of the [[Julian calendar]], but also note that the Spaniards celebrate it on December 12 instead.

With the help of the ''[[Informaciones Jurídicas de 1666]]'', a feast day in name of Our Lady of Guadalupe was requested and approved, as well as the transfer of the date of the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe from September 8 to December 12, the latest date on which the Virgin supposedly appeared to Juan Diego. The initiative to perform them was made by Francisco de Siles who proposed to ask the Church of Rome a Mass itself with allusive text to the apparitions and stamping of the image, along with the divine office itself, and the precept of hearing Mass on December 12, the last date of the apparitions of the Virgin to Juan Diego as the new date to commemorate the apparitions (which until then was on September 8, the birth of the Virgin).&lt;ref name="1666-1"&gt;Informaciones sobre la Milagrosa Aparición de la Santísima Virgen de Guadalupe, recibidas en 1666 y 1723, Amecameca, Imprenta Católica, 1889, por Fortino Hipólito Vera&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify |reason=language makes this paragraph unclear |date=March 2016}}

In 1666, the Church in México began gathering information from people who reported having known Juan Diego, and in 1723 a formal investigation into his life was ordered, where more data was gathered to support veneration. Because of the ''Informaciones Jurídicas de 1666'' in the year 1754, the [[Sacred Congregation of Rites]] confirmed the true value of the apparitions and granted celebrating Mass and Office for the feast of Guadalupe on December 12.&lt;ref name="1666-2"&gt;[http://www.enciclopedicohistcultiglesiaal.org/diccionario/index.php/GUADALUPE;_Informaciones_jur%C3%ADdicas_de_1666 GUADALUPE; Informaciones jurídicas de 1666] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208155310/http://www.enciclopedicohistcultiglesiaal.org/diccionario/index.php/GUADALUPE;_Informaciones_jur%C3%ADdicas_de_1666 |date=December 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://luxdomini.net/_gpe/contenido1/guadalupe_1666.htm Informaciones de 1666]&lt;/ref&gt;

These published accounts of the origin of the image venerated in Tepeyac increased interest in the identity of Juan Diego, the original recipient of the vision. A new Basilica church was built to house the image. Completed in 1709, it is now known as the Old Basilica.

==The crown ornament==
The image had originally featured a 12-point crown on the Virgin's head, but this disappeared in 1887–88. The change was first noticed on 23 February 1888, when the image was removed to a nearby church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IgnDSA8LgbYC&amp;redir_esc=n Stafford Poole, ''The Guadalupan Controversies in Mexico''], Stanford University Press, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IgnDSA8LgbYC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=%22onlookers+were+surprised+by+the+fact+that+there+was+no+crown+on+the+Virgin%27s+head%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sElW2GPsRe&amp;sig=Z7Vqmtq86Q8d1HPa-JaEMXBbJvw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lexxUMb2DYrTtAaIyYDYCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22onlookers%20were%20surprised%20by%20the%20fact%20that%20there%20was%20no%20crown%20on%20the%20Virgin%27s%20head%22&amp;f=false p. 60]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually a painter confessed on his deathbed that he had been instructed by a clergyman to remove the crown. This may have been motivated by the fact that the gold paint was flaking off of the crown, leaving it looking dilapidated. But according to the historian [[David Brading]], “the decision to remove rather than replace the crown was no doubt inspired by a desire to 'modernize' the image and reinforce its similarity to the nineteenth-century images of the Immaculate Conception which were exhibited at Lourdes and elsewhere… What is rarely mentioned is that the frame which surrounded the canvas was adjusted to leave almost no space above the Virgin's head, thereby obscuring the effects of the erasure."&lt;ref&gt;Brading (2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9_OP2FIUGQC&amp;redir_esc=n ''Mexican Phoenix''], p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; it is unclear why the frame was lowered, which makes the covering of the crown not easily noticeable.

[[File:Eternal father painting guadalupe.jpg|left|thumb|An 18th-century [[hagiographic]] painting of [[God the Father]] fashioning the image]]
A different crown was installed to the image. On 8 February 1887, a [[Papal bull]] from [[Pope Leo XIII]] granted permission a [[Canonical Coronation]] of the image, which occurred on 12 October  1895.&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopedia Guadalupana'', p. 267 (vol. II)&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Virgin of Guadalupe has been proclaimed "Queen of Mexico", "Patroness of the Americas", "Empress of Latin America", and "Protectress of Unborn Children" (the latter two titles given by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1999).&lt;ref name="mariologia.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariologia.org/aparicionesguadalupeespanol09.htm |title=Virgen de Guadalupe |publisher=Mariologia.org |accessdate=August 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426045240/http://www.mariologia.org/aparicionesguadalupeespanol09.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/629932/Our-Lady-of-Guadalupe Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Under this title, she was also proclaimed "Heavenly Patroness of the [[Philippines]]" on 16 July 1935 by [[Pope Pius XI]] both witnessed and signed by Cardinal [[Eugenio Pacelli]], a designation he later rescinded on 12 September 1942 upon becoming [[Pope Pius XII]].

On 25 March 1966, [[Pope Paul VI]] presented a [[Golden Rose]] to the sacred image. Finally, under Pope John Paul II the move to [[beatification|beatify]] Juan Diego intensified. John Paul II took a special interest in non-European Catholics and saints. During his leadership, the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] declared Juan Diego "venerable" (in 1987), and the pope himself announced his beatification on 6 May 1990, during a Mass at the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in Mexico City, declaring him “protector and advocate of the indigenous peoples," with December 9 established as his feast day.

At that time historians revived doubts as to the quality of the evidence regarding Juan Diego. The writings of bishop [[Juan de Zumárraga|Zumárraga]], into whose hands Juan purportedly delivered the miraculous image, did not refer to him or the event. The record of the 1556 ecclesiastical inquiry omitted him, and he was not mentioned in documentation before the mid-17th century. In 1996 the 83-year-old abbot of the [[Basilica of Guadalupe]], [[Guillermo Schulenburg]], was forced to resign following an interview published in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] magazine ''Ixthus,'' in which he was quoted as saying that Juan Diego was "a symbol, not a reality", and that his canonization would be the “recognition of a cult. It is not recognition of the physical, real existence of a person.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailycatholic.org/issue/archives/1999Dec/232dec7,vol.10,no.232txt/dec7nv4.htm ''Daily Catholic''], December 7, 1999, accessed November 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883 [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta]], historian and biographer of Zumárraga, in a confidential report on the Lady of Guadalupe for [[Bishop]] Labastida, had been hesitant to support the story of the vision. He concluded that Juan Diego had not existed.&lt;ref&gt;''Juan Diego y las Apariciones el pimo Tepeyac'' (Paperback) by Joaquín García Icazbalceta {{ISBN|970-92771-3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Father Xavier Escalada, a Jesuit whose four volume Guadalupe encyclopedia had just been published, announced the existence of a sheet of parchment (known as ''[[Codex Escalada]]''), which bore an illustrated account of the vision and some notations in Nahuatl concerning the life and death of Juan Diego. Previously unknown, the document was dated 1548. It bore the signatures of Antonio Valeriano and Bernardino de Sahagún, which are considered to verify its contents. The codex was the subject of an appendix to the Guadalupe encyclopedia, published in 1997.&lt;ref name = "Deerskin"/&gt; Some scholars remained unconvinced, one describing the discovery of the Codex as "rather like finding a picture of St. Paul's vision of Christ on the [[road to Damascus]], drawn by St. Luke and signed by St. Peter."&lt;ref name="brading" /&gt;

===  Marian title ===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Virgin of Guadalupe - Isidro Escamilla - overall.jpg|thumbnail| ''Virgin of Guadalupe'', 1 September 1824. Oil on canvas by Isidro Escamilla. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
In the earliest account of the apparition, the ''[[Nican Mopohua]]'', the Virgin Mary tells Juan Bernardino, the uncle of [[Juan Diego]], that the image left on the tilma is to be known by the name "the Perfect Virgin, Holy Mary of Guadalupe."&lt;ref&gt;[http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/nahuatl/nican/nican7.html "Nican Mopohua: Here It Is Told,"], p. 208, UC San Diego&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars do not agree as to how the name "Guadalupe" was ascribed to the image.&lt;ref name="Chavez Eduardo 2009, p. 205"&gt;Anderson Carl and Chavez Eduardo, ''Our Lady of Guadalupe: Mother of the Civilization of Love,'' Doubleday, New York, 2009, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the Spanish transcribed or transliterated a [[Nahuatl]] name, as the site had long been an important sacred spot. Others hold that the Spanish name ''Guadalupe'' is the original name, and refers to the Spanish [[Our Lady of Guadalupe, Extremadura]], whose cult had been important in Spain in the 16th century and had been brought to the New World with the Spanish conquest.

The first theory to promote a [[Nahuatl]] origin was that of Luis Becerra Tanco.&lt;ref name="Chavez Eduardo 2009, p. 205"/&gt; In his 1675 work ''Felicidad de Mexico'', Becerra Tanco claimed that Juan Bernardino and [[Juan Diego]] would not have been able to understand the name Guadalupe because the "d" and "g" sounds do not exist in [[Nahuatl]].

He proposed two [[Nahuatl]] alternative names that sound similar to "Guadalupe", ''Tecuatlanopeuh'' {{IPA-nah|tekʷat͡ɬaˈnopeʍ|}}, which he translates as "she whose origins were in the rocky summit", and ''Tecuantlaxopeuh'' {{IPA-nah|tekʷant͡ɬaˈʃopeʍ|}}, "she who banishes those who devoured us."&lt;ref name="Chavez Eduardo 2009, p. 205"/&gt;

Ondina and Justo Gonzalez suggest that the name is a Spanish version of the [[Nahuatl]] term, ''[[Coatlaxopeuh|Coātlaxopeuh]]'' {{IPA-nah|koaːt͡ɬaˈʃopeʍ|}}, which they interpret as meaning “the one who crushes the serpent,” and that it may be referring to the feathered serpent [[Quetzalcoatl]]. In addition, Mary was portrayed in European art as crushing the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] of the Garden of Eden.&lt;ref&gt;González, Ondina E. and Justo L. González, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8TO3FpclI-gC&amp;dq ''Christianity in Latin America: A History''], p. 59, Cambridge University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another theory the juxtaposition of Guadalupe and a snake may indicate a nexus with the Aztec goddess of love and fertility, [[Tonantzin]] (in Nahuatl, "Our Revered Mother"), who was also known by the name [[Coatlicue|Coatlícue]] ("The Serpent Skirt"). This appears to be borne out by the fact that this goddess had had a temple dedicated to her on the very Tepeyac Hill where Juan Diego had his vision, temple which had recently been destroyed at the behest of the new Catholic authorities. In the 16th century the Franciscans were suspicious that the cult of Guadalupe showed, or was susceptible to, elements of [[syncretism]], i.e. the importation of an object of reverence in one belief system into another (see above).

The theory promoting the [[Spanish language]] origin of the name claims that:

*[[Juan Diego]] and Juan Bernardino would have been familiar with the [[Spanish language]] "g" and "d" sounds since their baptismal names contain those sounds.
*There is no documentation of any other name for the Virgin during the almost 144 years between the apparition being recorded in 1531 and Becerra Tanco's proposed theory in 1675.
*Documents written by contemporary Spaniards and Franciscan friars argue that for the name to be changed to a native name, such as ''Tepeaca'' or ''Tepeaquilla,'' would not make sense if a [[Nahuatl]] name were already in use, and suggest the Spanish ''Guadalupe'' was the original.&lt;ref name="Chavez Eduardo 2009, p. 205"/&gt;

== The venerated image as artifact==

=== Iconographic description ===
* The image features a full-length representation of a [[mestiza]] girl or young woman with high cheek-bones, delicate features, and straight, unbraided black hair simply parted in the middle framing her face.
* The subject matter is in a standing posture showing in contemplative prayer with hands joined and [[little finger]] separated and head slightly inclined; she gazes with heavy-lidded eyes at a spot below and to her right, and to left in viewpoint of the observer. 
*  She is dressed from neck to feet in a pink robe and blue-green [[cerulean]] mantle, one side folded within the arms, emblazoned with eight-point stars with two black tassels tied at high waist, wearing a neck brooch featuring a colonial styled cross. 
* The robe is spangled with a small gold [[quatrefoil]] motif ornamented with vines and flowers, its sleeves reaching to her wrists where the cuffs of a white undergarment appear. 
* The subject stands on a crescent moon, allegedly color silver in the past and now have turned dark. 
* A feathered [[cherub]]ic angel with outstretched arms carries the robe on her exposed feet which is uncolored. 
* A sunburst of straight and wavy gold rays interchange behind while projecting behind the Virgin are enclosed within a [[mandorla]]. Beyond the mandorla to right and left is an unpainted expanse, white in colour with a faint blue tinge. The present image shows the 1791 nitric acid spill on the top right side, unaffecting the subject matter's [[aureola]].&lt;ref&gt;See Callahan Philip Serna, ''The Tilma under Infrared Radiation'', CARA Studies on Popular Devotion, vol. II: Guadalupanan Studies No.3, pp. 6–16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical description ===
The portrait was executed on a fabric support of natural material constituted by two pieces (originally three) joined together.  The join is clearly visible as a seam passing from top to bottom, with the Virgin's face and hands and the head of the angel on the left piece. It passes through the left wrist of the Virgin.  The fabric is mounted on a large metal sheet to which it has been glued for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan, Philip Serna, ''The Tilma under Infrared Radiation'', CARA Studies on Popular Devotion, vol. II: Guadalupanan Studies No.3, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The image, currently set in a massive frame protected behind bullet-proof glass, hangs inclined at a slight angle on the wall of the basilica behind the altar.  At this point, there is a wide gap between the wall and the sanctuary facilitating closer viewing from moving walkways set on the floor beneath the main level of the basilica, carrying people a short distance in either direction.  Viewed from the main body of the basilica, the image is located above and to the right of the altar and is retracted at night into a small vault (accessible by steps) set into the wall.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief description of the vault, see Callahan, Philip Serna, ''The Tilma under Infrared Radiation'', CARA Studies on Popular Devotion, vol. II: Guadalupanan Studies No.3, at p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  An intricate metal crown designed by the painter Salomé Pina according to plans devised by Rómulo Escudero and Pérez Gallardo, and executed by the Parisian goldsmith, Edgar Morgan, is fixed above the image by a rod, and a massive Mexican flag is draped around and below the frame.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Enciclopedia Guadalupana'', p. 267 (vol. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of the fabric is discussed below.  Its measurements were taken by José Ignacio Bartolache on December 29, 1786 in the presence of Joseph Bernardo de Nava, a public notary: height {{cvt|170|cm|in}}, width {{cvt|105|cm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Enciclopedia Guadalupana'', p. 536f. (vol. 3).  The December 2001 issue (special edition) of ''Guia México Desconocido'' (p. 86) dedicated to the Virgen de Guadalupe has a fact box on p.&amp;nbsp;21 which gives slightly different dimensions: height {{cvt|178|by|103|cm|in|adj=mid|wide}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The original height (before it was first shielded behind glass in the late 18th century, at which time the unpainted portion beyond the Virgin's head must have been cut down) was {{cvt|229|cm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;See Fernández de Echeverría y Veytia (1718–1780), Baluartes de México, (publ. posthumously, 1820), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical analyses===
[[File:Our Lady of Guadalupe.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The original ''tilma'' of [[Saint Juan Diego]], which hangs above the high altar of the Guadalupe Basilica. The suspended crown atop the image dates back to its [[Canonical Coronation]] on October 12, 1895.  The image is protected by bulletproof glass and low-oxygen atmosphere.]]

Neither the fabric ("the support") nor the image (together, "the tilma") has been analyzed using the full range of resources now available to museum conservationists.  Four technical studies have been conducted so far. Of these, the findings of at least three have been published. Each study required the permission of the custodians of the tilma in the Basilica. However, Callahan's study was taken at the initiative of a third party: the custodians did not know in advance what his research would reveal.

:MC &amp;nbsp;– in 1756 a prominent artist, [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], published a report entitled ''[[Maravilla Americana]]'', containing the results of the ocular and manual inspections by him and six other painters in 1751 and 1752.&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera, Miguel: ''Maravilla Americana y conjunto de varias maravillas observadas con la direccíon de las reglas del arte de la pintura en la prodigiosa imagen de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, Mexico'', 1756, facs. ed. Mexico, 1977; summary in Brading, D.A.: ''Mexican Phoenix: Our Lady of Guadalupe: Image and Tradition Across Five Centuries'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, pp. 169–172&lt;/ref&gt;

:G&amp;nbsp;– José Antonio Flores Gómez, an art restorer, discussed in a 2002 interview with the Mexican journal ''[[Proceso (magazine)|Proceso]],'' certain technical issues relative to the tilma. He had worked on it in 1947 and 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Vera, Rodrigo: [http://www.proceso.com.mx/rv/hemeroteca/detalleHemeroteca/127963 "Un restaurador de la guadalupana expone detalles técnicos que desmitifican a la imagen"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Revista ''Proceso'' N° 1343, July 27, 2002, pp. 17–18, cf.

&lt;/ref&gt;

:PC&amp;nbsp;– in 1979 Philip Callahan, (biophysicist, USDA entomologist, NASA consultant) specializing in [[infrared imaging]], was allowed direct access to visually inspect, and photograph, the image. He took numerous infrared photographs of the front of the tilma. Taking notes that were later published, his assistant noted that the original art work was neither cracked nor flaked, while later additions (gold leaf, silver plating the moon) showed serious signs of wear, if not complete deterioration. Callahan could not explain the excellent state of preservation of the un-retouched areas of the image on the tilma, particularly the upper two-thirds of the image.  His findings, with photographs, were published in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan, Philip: "The Tilma under Infrared Radiation", ''CARA Studies in Popular Devotion'', vol. II, ''Guadalupan Studies,'' No. III (March 1981, 45pp.), Washington, D.C.; cf. Leatham, Miguel (2001).

:R&amp;nbsp;– In 2002 ''Proceso'' published an interview with José Sol Rosales, formerly director of the Center for the Conservation and Listing of Heritage Artifacts (Patrimonio Artístico Mueble) of the National Institute of Fine Arts (INBA) in México City. The article included extracts from a report which Rosales had written in 1982 of his findings from his inspection of the tilma that year using raking and [[UV]] light. It was done at low magnification with a stereo microscope of the type used for surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Vera, Rodrigo: [http://www.proceso.com.mx/rv/hemeroteca/detalleHemeroteca/127581 "el análisis que ocultó el vaticano"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Revista ''Proceso'' N° 1333, May 18, 2002; cf.

Summary conclusions ("contra" indicates a contrary finding)
* Canvas Support: The material of the support is soft to the touch (almost silken: MC; something like cotton: G) but to the eye it suggested a coarse weave of palm threads called "pita" or the rough fiber called "cotense" (MC), or a [[hemp]] and linen mixture (R). It was traditionally held to be made from ''[[ixtle]],'' an [[agave]] fiber.
* Ground, or primer: R asserted (MC and PC contra) by ocular examination that the tilma was primed, though with primer "applied irregularly." R does not clarify whether his observed "irregular" application entails that majorly the entire tilma was primed, or just certain areas&amp;nbsp;– such as those areas of the tilma extrinsic to the image&amp;nbsp;– where PC agrees had later additions.  MC, alternatively, observed that the image had soaked through to the reverse of the tilma.&lt;ref&gt;Brading (2001), ''Mexican Phoenix'', p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:El Rostro de la Virgen.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Detail of the face. Note the discoloration on the top part of the head, where a crown is claimed to have been present at some point, now obscured by an enlarged frame for unknown reasons.]]
*  Under-drawing: PC asserted there was no under-drawing.
*  Brush-work: R suggested (PC contra) there was some visible brushwork on the original image, but in a minute area of the image ("her eyes, including the irises, have outlines, apparently applied by a brush").
* Condition of the surface layer: PC reports that the un-retouched portions of the image, particularly the blue mantle and the face, are in a very good state of preservation, with no flaking or peeling. The three most recent inspections (G, PC and R) agree (i) that additions have been made to the image (gold leaf added to the sun's rays—which has flaked off; silver paint or other material to depict the moon—which has discolored; and the re-construction or addition of the angel supporting the Marian image),  and (ii) that portions of the original image have been abraded and re-touched in places.  Some flaking is visible, though only in retouched areas (mostly along the line of the vertical seam, or at passages considered to be later additions).
*  Varnish: The tilma has never been varnished.
*  Binding Medium: R provisionally identified the [[pigments]] and binding medium (distemper) as consistent with 16th-century methods of painting sargas (MC, PC contra for different reasons), but the color values and luminosity are in good condition.
:The technique of painting on fabric with water-soluble pigments (with or without primer or ground) is well-attested. The binding medium is generally animal glue or [[gum arabic]] (see: [[Distemper (paint)|Distemper]]).  Such an artifact is variously discussed in the literature as a [[tüchlein]] or sarga.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford, David and Roy, Ashok: "The Technique of Two Paintings by Dieric Bouts," ''[[National Gallery]] Technical Bulletin'' vol. 10, 1986, pp. 42–57;  Santos Gómez, Sonia and San Andrés Moya, Margarita: "La Pintura de Sargas," ''Archivo Español de Arte,'' LXXVII, 2004, 305, pp. 59–74&lt;/ref&gt; Tüchlein paintings are very fragile, and are not well preserved,&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, T., &amp; Woollett, A.

==Trans-religious significance==
Religious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe appears in Roman Catholic parishes, especially those with Latin American heritage.&lt;ref name="Johnson2015"/&gt; In addition, due to the growth of [[History of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States|Hispanic communities in the United States]], religious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe has started appearing in some [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]], and [[Methodist]] churches.&lt;ref name="Johnson2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Maxwell E.|title=The Church in Act: Lutheran Liturgical Theology in Ecumenical Conversation|date=1 April 2015|publisher=Fortress Press|language=English|isbn=9781451496680|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbol of Mexico===

Anonymous (Mexican) author, 18th century.]]

''Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe'' became the recognized symbol of Catholic Mexicans. [[Miguel Sanchez (writer)|Miguel Sánchez]], the author in 1648 of the first published account of the vision, identified Guadalupe as ''Revelation's'' [[Woman of the Apocalypse]], and said:&lt;blockquote&gt;"...this New World has been won and conquered by the hand of the Virgin Mary&amp;nbsp;... [who had] prepared, disposed, and contrived her exquisite likeness in this her Mexican land, which was conquered for such a glorious purpose, won that there should appear so Mexican an image."&lt;ref name="brading" &gt;D.A. Brading, ''Mexican Phoenix Our Lady of Guadalupe:Image and Tradition Across Five Centuries'' (2001) p 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Throughout the Mexican national history of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Guadalupan name and image have been unifying national symbols; the first [[President of Mexico]] (1824–29) changed his name from José Miguel Ramón Adaucto Fernández y Félix to [[Guadalupe Victoria]] in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe.&lt;ref name="krauze"/&gt; Father [[Miguel Hidalgo]], in the [[Mexican War of Independence]] (1810), and [[Emiliano Zapata]], in the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910), led their respective armed forces with Guadalupan [[flag]]s emblazoned with an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. In 1999, the Church officially proclaimed her the ''Patroness of the Americas'', the ''Empress of Latin America'', and the ''Protectress of Unborn Children''.

[[File:Guadalupano.jpg|Guadalupanflag|thumb|The revolutionary banner carried by [[Miguel Hidalgo]] and his insurgent army during the [[Mexican War of Independence]]]]

In 1810 [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] initiated the bid for Mexican independence with his ''[[Grito de Dolores]],'' with the cry "[[Death]] to the [[Spaniards]] and long live the Virgin of Guadalupe!" When Hidalgo's mestizo-indigenous army attacked [[Guanajuato]] and [[Morelia|Valladolid]], they placed "the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which was the insignia of their enterprise, on sticks or on reeds painted different colors" and "they all wore a print of the Virgin on their hats."&lt;ref name="krauze" &gt;Krauze, Enrique. Mexico, Biography of Power. A History of Modern Mexico 1810–1996. HarperCollins: New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; After Hidalgo's death leadership of the revolution fell to a [[mestizo]] priest named [[José María Morelos]], who led insurgent troops in the Mexican south. Morelos adopted the Virgin as the seal of his [[Congress of Chilpancingo]], inscribing her feast day into the [[Chilpancingo]] constitution and declaring that Guadalupe was the power behind his victories:&lt;blockquote&gt;New Spain puts less faith in its own efforts than in the power of God and the intercession of its Blessed Mother, who appeared within the precincts of Tepeyac as the miraculous image of Guadalupe that had come to comfort us, defend us, visibly be our protection.&lt;ref name="krauze" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Simón Bolívar]] noticed the Guadalupan theme in these uprisings, and shortly before Morelos's execution in 1815 wrote: "the leaders of the independence struggle have put [[fanaticism]] to use by proclaiming the famous Virgin of Guadalupe as the queen of the patriots, praying to her in times of hardship and displaying her on their [[flag]]s&amp;nbsp;... the [[veneration]] for this image in Mexico far exceeds the greatest reverence that the shrewdest prophet might inspire."&lt;ref name="brading" /&gt;

In 1912, [[Emiliano Zapata]]'s peasant army rose out of the south against the government of [[Francisco Madero]]. Though Zapata's rebel forces were primarily interested in [[land reform]]&amp;nbsp;– "tierra y libertad" ('land and liberty') was the [[slogan]] of the uprising&amp;nbsp;– when his peasant troops penetrated [[Mexico City]] they carried Guadalupan banners.&lt;ref&gt;Documentary footage of Zapata and Pancho Villa's armies entering Mexico City can be seen at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_wAoEqeHKU YouTube.com], Zapata's men can be seen carrying the flag of the Guadalupana about 38 seconds in.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the contemporary Zapatista National Liberation Army ([[EZLN]]) named their "mobile city" in honor of the Virgin: it is called Guadalupe Tepeyac. EZLN spokesperson [[Subcomandante Marcos]] wrote a humorous letter in 1995 describing the EZLN bickering over what to do with a Guadalupe statue they had received as a gift.&lt;ref&gt;Subcomandante Marcos, [https://web.archive.org/web/20000523012900/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/mexico/ezln/marcos_virgin_mar95.html Flag.blackened.net], "Zapatistas Guadalupanos and the Virgin of Guadalupe" March 24, 1995, accessed December 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexican culture===
[[File:LA Cathedral Lady of Guadalupe statue.jpg|left|thumb| Reliquary in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]] in Los Angeles, California, containing a fragment of the tilma of [[Juan Diego]]]]
Harringon argues that:
:The Aztecs&amp;nbsp;... had an elaborate, coherent symbolic system for making sense of their lives. When this was destroyed by the Spaniards, something new was needed to fill the void and make sense of New Spain&amp;nbsp;... the image of Guadalupe served that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Patricia. "Mother of Death, Mother of Rebirth: The Virgin of Guadalupe." ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion.'' Vol. 56, Issue 1, pp. 25–50. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hernán Cortés]], the Conquistador who overthrew the [[Aztec empire]] in 1521, was a native of [[Extremadura]], home to [[Our Lady of Guadalupe, Extremadura|Our Lady of Guadalupe]]. By the 16th century the Extremadura Guadalupe, a statue of the Virgin said to be carved by [[Saint Luke]] the Evangelist, was already a national icon. It was found at the beginning of the 14th century when the Virgin appeared to a humble shepherd and ordered him to dig at the site of the apparition. The recovered Virgin then miraculously helped to expel the Moors from Spain, and her small shrine evolved into the great Guadalupe monastery.

According to the traditional account, the name of Guadalupe was chosen by the Virgin herself when she appeared on the hill outside Mexico City in 1531, ten years after the Conquest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sancta.org/nameguad.html Sancta.org], "Why the name 'of Guadalupe'?", accessed November 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Literature and Film===
One notable reference in literature to La Virgen of Guadalupe and her predecessor, the Aztec Earth goddess [[Tonantzin|Tonantzín]], is in Sandra Cisneros' short story "Little Miracles, Kept Promises," from her collection ''Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories'' (1991).  Cisneros' story is constructed out of brief notes that people give Our Lady of Guadalupe in thanks for favors received, which in Cisneros' hands becomes a portrait of an extended Chicano community living throughout Texas.  "Little Miracles" ends with an extended narrative (pp.&amp;nbsp;124–29) of a feminist artist, Rosario "Chayo" De Leon, who at first didn't allow images of La Virgen de Guadalupe in her home because she associated her with subservience and suffering, particularly by Mexican women.  But when she learns that Guadalupe's shrine is built on the same hill in Mexico City that had a shrine to Tonantzín, the Aztec Earth goddess and serpent destroyer, Chayo comes to understand that there's a deep, syncretic connection between the Aztec goddess and the Mexican saint; together they inspire Chayo's new artistic creativity, inner strength, and independence.  In Chayo's words, "I finally understood who you are.  No longer Mary the mild, but our mother Tonantzín.   Your church at Tepeyac built on the site of her temple" (128).&lt;ref&gt;Cisneros, Sandra.  "Little Miracles, Kept Promises."  ''Woman Hollering Creed and Other Stories''.  New York: Random House, 1991. 116-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Our Lady of Guadalupe, Juan Diego, and the tilma have been investigated through film several times in recent history. One of the most notable and thorough filmic investigations was done by director Tim Watkins in the 2013 film [[The Blood &amp; The Rose]].&lt;ref name="The Blood &amp; The Rose"&gt;http://www.thebloodandtherose.com&lt;/ref&gt; Documentarians have been portraying the message of Our Lady of Guadalupe since the 1990s in an attempt to bring the message of the apparition to the North American audience.

==Catholic Church==

===Papal Honors===
Several [[Pontiff]]s have honored the image, specifically:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* [[Pope Benedict XIV]], in the [[Papal bull]] ''Non Est Equidem'' of 25 May 1754, declared Our Lady of Guadalupe patroness of what was then named New Spain, corresponding to Spanish Central and Northern America, and approved liturgical texts for the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the [[Breviary]] in her honor. 
* [[Pope Leo XIII]] granted new texts in 1891 and on 8 February 1887 authorized the [[canonical coronation]] of the image, which occurred on 12 October   1895. 
* [[Pope Pius X]] proclaimed her patron of Latin America in 1910.
* [[Pope Pius XI]] declared Our Lady of Guadalupe the "Heavenly Patroness of the Philippines" on 16 July 1935 and the relevant [[Apostolic Letter]] was signed by [[Vatican Secretary of State]] Cardinal [[Eugenio Pacelli]] (later [[Pope Pius XII]]).&lt;ref name="mariologia.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 28 (1936), pp. 63f.  – 16 Iulii (July) 1935.

* [[Pope Pius XII]] accorded her the title "Queen of Mexico and Empress of the Americas" in 1945, and "Patroness of the Americas" in 1946. 
* [[Pope John XXIII]] invoked her as "Mother of the Americas" in 1961, referring to her as Mother and Teacher of the Faith of All American populations.
* [[Pope Paul VI]] gave the image a [[Golden Rose]] on 20 March 1966.&lt;ref name="popes" &gt;In accordance with tradition he blessed the rose, the work of the Roman sculptor Giuseppe Pirrone, on [[Laetare Sunday]], 20 March 1966 and consigned it to Cardinal Confalonieri as his [[Papal legate|legate]], who presented it at the Basilica on 31 May 1966; Notitiae, bulletin of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, 2002, pages 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/es/speeches/1966/documents/hf_p-vi_spe_19660531_rosa-oro.html the speeches] delivered by Bl. Pope Paul VI on each occasion.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pope John Paul II]] visited her shrine on 26 January 1979, and again when he beatified Juan Diego there on 6 May 1990. In 1992, he dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe a chapel within [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. At the request of the Special Assembly for the Americas of the Synod of Bishops, he reiterated her title of Patroness of the Americas on 22 January 1999 and granted the rank of [[solemnity]] in that region. The same [[Supreme Pontiff]] included in the [[General Roman Calendar]] as an optional [[memorial (liturgy)|memorial]] the liturgical celebration of Our Lady of Guadalupe on 12 December.&lt;ref name="popes" /&gt;
* [[Pope Francis]] granted the image a second [[Golden Rose]] via [[Marc Ouellet|Cardinal Marc Ouellet]] for presentation at the Basilica on 18 November  2013.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic News Agency report of 22 November 2013 [http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-sends-golden-rose-to-our-lady-of-guadalupe/], accessed 25 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The same [[Supreme Pontiff]] granted a new gold-plated silver crown with an accompanying prayer to the image during his apostolic visit to the Basilica on 13 February 2016. On the crown was inscribed "''Mater Mea, Spes Mea"'' ("My Mother [and] My Hope"). This crown is stored within the chancery and is not publicly worn by the  image enshrined at the altar.

==Pious Beliefs and Devotions==

===Protection from damage===
[[File:Mercado de Xochimilco - Altar de la Virgen de Guadalupe.jpg|thumbnail|right|Altar in a market of [[Mexico City]]]]
Roman Catholic sources claim that the original image has many miraculous and supernatural properties, including that the [[Tilmàtli|tilma]] has maintained its structural integrity for approximately 500 years despite exposure to soot, candle wax, incense, constant manual veneration by devotees, the historical fact that the image was displayed without any protective glass for its first 115 years, while replicas normally endure for only circa 15 years before degrading,&lt;ref name="giulio" &gt;Guerra, Giulio Dante. [http://www.alleanzacattolica.org/indici/articoli/guerragd205_206.htm AlleanzaCattolica.org], "La Madonna di Guadalupe". 'Inculturazione' Miracolosa. Christianita. n. 205–206, 1992; accessed December 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and that it repaired itself with no external assistance after a 1791 accident in which nitric acid was spilled on its top right, causing considerable damage but leaving the aureola of the Virgin intact.

Furthermore,  on 14 November 1921 a bomb hidden within a basket of flowers and left under the tilma by an anti-Catholic [[secularist]] exploded and damaged the altar of the Basilica that houses the original image, but the tilma was unharmed. A brass standing crucifix, bent by the explosion, is now preserved at the shrine's museum and is believed to be miraculous by devotees.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''Mexican Phoenix. Our Lady of Guadalupe: Image and Tradition Across Five Centuries'', Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, (2001), p. 314; Stafford Poole, ''The Guadalupan Controversies in Mexico'', Stanford, California: Stanford University Press (2006), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Supernatural Qualities===
In 1929 and 1951 photographers claimed to have found a figure reflected in the Virgin's eyes; upon inspection they said that the reflection was tripled in what is called the [[Purkinje images|Purkinje effect]], commonly found in human eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071209175102/http://www.interlupe.com.mx/8-e.html Web.archive.org]{{unreliable source?|date=February 2016}}. "The Eyes" Interlupe. Accessed December 3&lt;/ref&gt; An ophthalmologist, Dr. Jose Aste Tonsmann, later enlarged an image of the Virgin's eyes by 2500x and claimed to have found not only the aforementioned single figure, but images of all the witnesses present when the [[Tilmàtli|tilma]] was first revealed before Zumárraga in 1531, plus a small family group of mother, father, and a group of children, in the center of the Virgin's eyes, fourteen people in all.&lt;ref name="catholiceducation.org"&gt;[https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/science-sees-what-mary-saw-from-juan-diegos-tilma.html "Science Sees What Mary Saw From Juan Diego's Tilma", catholiceducation.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620110845/http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0447.html |date=June 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous Catholic websites repeat the claim&lt;ref name="experiencefestival.com"&gt;[http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Our_Lady_of_Guadalupe_-_The_Tilma/id/1825094 Experiencefestival.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710211917/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Our_Lady_of_Guadalupe_-_The_Tilma/id/1825094 |date=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that in 1936 [[biochemistry|biochemist]] [[Richard Kuhn]] analyzed a sample of the fabric and announced that the pigments used were from no known source, whether animal, mineral, or vegetable.&lt;ref name="catholiceducation.org"/&gt;. According to ''The Wonder of Guadalupe'' by Francis Johnston, this was requested by Professor Hahn and Professor Marcelino Junco, retired professor of organic chemistry at the National University of Mexico. 

Dr. Philip Serna Callahan, who photographed the icon under [[infrared]] light, declared from his photographs that portions of the face, hands, robe, and mantle had been painted in one step, with no sketches or corrections and no visible brush strokes.&lt;ref&gt;Sennott, Br. Thomas Mary. [http://www.motherofallpeoples.com/2011/12/the-tilma-of-guadalupe-a-scientific-analysis/ MotherOfAllPeoples.com ], "The Tilma of Guadalupe: A Scientific Analysis".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veneration===
The shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe is the most visited Catholic pilgrimage destination in the world. Over the Friday and Saturday of December 11 to 12, 2009, a record number of 6.1 million pilgrims visited the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City to commemorate the anniversary of the apparition.&lt;ref name="zenit.org"&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-27841?l=english Znit.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113113813/http://www.zenit.org/article-27841?l=english |date=November 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virgin of Guadalupe is considered the Patroness of Mexico and the Continental Americas; she is also venerated by Native Americans, on the account of the devotion calling for the conversion of the Americas. Replicas of the tilma can be found in thousands of churches throughout the world, and numerous [[parish]]es bear her name.

Due to a claim that her black [[girdle]] indicates pregnancy on the image, the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under this title is popularly invoked as ''Patroness of the Unborn'' and a common image for the [[Pro-Life]] movement.

{{canon law|expanded=matrimonial}}
The '''Pauline privilege''' ({{lang-la|privilegium Paulinum}}) is the allowance by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] of the [[divorce|dissolution of marriage]] of two persons not [[baptism|baptized]] at the time the marriage occurred.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Story/TabId/2672/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/13797/The-Pauline-Privilege.aspx |title=Mannion, M. Francis. "The Pauline Privilege", The Catholic Answer, '&amp;#39;OSV Newsweekly'&amp;#39;, January 3, 2014 |publisher=Osv.com |date=2014-01-03 |accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pauline privilege is drawn from the [[Paul the Apostle|apostle Paul]]'s instructions in the [[1 Corinthians|First Epistle to the Corinthians]].

==Origin==

The Pauline privilege is the allowance by the Church of the [[divorce|dissolution of marriage]] of two persons not [[baptism|baptized]] at the time the marriage occurred.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

[[1 Corinthians 7]]:10–15 states:
{{quote|To the married I give charge, not I but the Lord, that the wife should not separate from her husband ... and that the husband should not divorce his wife. To the rest I say, not the Lord, ... But if the unbelieving partner desires to separate, let it be so; in such a case the brother or sister is not bound. For God has called us to peace.&lt;ref&gt;({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:10–15}} [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first section, "not I but the Lord", roughly matches [[Jesus]]' teaching on divorce, found in an [[Six Antitheses|antithesis]] ([[Matthew 5:32]]) with parallels in [[Matthew 19]]:9, [[Luke 16]]:18, and [[Mark 10]]:11. The second section, "I say, not the Lord", gives Paul's own teaching on divorce,&lt;ref name=Caridi/&gt; and was initiated to address a serious pastoral problem in the Church in Corinth where problems apparently developed in marriages between believers and unbelievers. Therefore, in instances where the unbaptized spouse left the newly baptized spouse, Paul allowed the latter to enter into a new marriage.&lt;ref name=Gantley/&gt; 

In the [[Catholic Church]] and in some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations this is interpreted as allowing the dissolution of a [[marriage]] between two non-baptized persons in the case that one (but not both) of the partners seeks baptism and [[Conversion to Christianity|converts to Christianity]] and the other partner leaves the marriage.&lt;ref name=Caridi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canonlawmadeeasy.com/2013/04/04/what-is-the-pauline-privilege/ |title=Caridi, Cathy. "What is the Pauline Privilege?", Canon Law Made Easy, April 4, 2013 |publisher=Canonlawmadeeasy.com |date=2013-04-04 |accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming it is established that both spouses were un-baptized at the time of their marriage, and subsequently obtained a civil divorce, should the now baptized party wish to enter into a sacramental marriage, the Pauline Privilege ("in favor of the faith") takes place ''ipso facto'' at the time of that marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archspm.org/sections/procedures-favor-faith-pauline-petrine-privilege/ |title="Procedures: Favor of the Faith", Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis |publisher=Archspm.org |date= |accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Latin Church]], the subject is covered in canons 1143–1147 and can be handled on the diocesan level.&lt;ref name=Gantley&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/v/experts/showmessage.asp?number=410268 |title=Gantley, Mark J., "Petrine or Pauline Privilege", EWTN, September 3, 2004 |publisher=Ewtn.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] the applicable canons are found in the ''[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]]'', canons 854–858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010430_favor-fidei_en.html |title=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. "Norms on the Preparation of the Process for the Dissolution of the Marriage Bond in Favour of the Faith", April 30, 2001 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church's canon law]], the Pauline privilege does not apply when either of the partners was a Christian at the time of marriage. It differs from [[annulment]] because it dissolves a valid natural (but not sacramental) marriage whereas an annulment declares that a marriage was invalid from the beginning.

The related [[Petrine privilege]], which also allows remarriage after divorce, may be invoked if only one of the partners was baptized at the time of the first marriage.

'''Pushkalavati''' ([[Pashto]] and {{Lang-ur|پُشْكَلآوَتي}}; {{IAST3|Puṣkalāvatī}}) was the capital of the [[Gandhara]] kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sagar|first1=Krishna Chandra|title=Foreign Influence on Ancient India|date=1992|publisher=Northern Book Centre|isbn=9788172110284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ruins are located on the outskirts of the modern city of [[Charsadda]], in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province of [[Pakistan]]. Its ruins are located on the banks of [[Swat River]], near its junction with [[Kabul River]]. Pushkalavati was the capital of the ancient [[Gandhara]] kingdom before the 6th century BCE, when it became an [[Achaemenid]] regional capital, and it remained an important city until the 2nd century CE.

The region around ancient Pushkulavati was recorded in the Zoroastrian ''[[Zend Avesta]]'' as ''Vaēkərəta'', or the [[Avestan geography|seventh most beautiful place on earth]] created by [[Ahura Mazda]]. It was known as the "crown jewel" of [[Bactria]], and held sway over nearby [[Taxila|ancient Taxila]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9035986/Gandhara Encyclopædia Britannica: Gandhara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929225502/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9035986/Gandhara |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Pushkalavati ([[Sanskrit]]: पुष्कलावती, {{IAST3|Puṣkalāvatī}}) means ''Lotus City'' in [[Sanskrit]]. According to the ''[[Ramayana]]'', it was named Pushkalavati because it was founded by Pushkala, the son of [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharat]] (and hence nephew of Hindu deity [[Rama]]).

==Ruins==
The ruins of Pushkalavati consist of many stupas and the sites of two ancient cities.

===Bala Hisar===
Bala Hisar site in this area was first occupied in the 2nd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/balar-hisar/bh-home Investigating ancient Pushkalavati] Pushkalavati Archaeological Research Project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali et al. 1998: 6–14; Young 2003: 37–40; Coningham 2004: 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later 6th century BCE, Pushkalavati became the capital of the [[Achaemenid]] Gandhara satrapy.&lt;ref&gt;Rafi U. Samad, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pNUwBYGYgxsC&amp;pg=PA33 ''The Grandeur of Gandhara: The Ancient Buddhist Civilization of the Swat, Peshawar, Kabul and Indus Valleys.''] Algora Publishing, 2011, p. 32 {{ISBN|0875868592}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location was first excavated in 1902 by the archaeologist [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]]. Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]] conducted some excavations there in 1962, and identified various Achaemenid remains.

Later in the regions historical chronology, King [[Ashoka]] built a stupa there which was described by [[Xuanzang]] when he visited in 630 CE, which to this day remains unidentified and undiscovered.

===Peucela and Shaikhan Dheri===
The [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Bactrian Greeks]] built a new city ('''Peucela''' or '''Peucelaitis''') at this site which lies one kilometre from [[Bala Hissar, Peshawar|Bala Hissar]] on the other side of the branch of [[River Jinde]]. This city was occupied by [[Parthian empire|Parthian]], [[Saka]]s and [[Kushan]]s and subsequently{{When|date=May 2011}} became known as '''Shaikhan Dheri''' (AKA '''Shaikhn Dher''', etc.). In the 2nd century CE, river changed its course and city was flooded. The town moved to the site of the modern village of [[Rajjar]].

The former city's ruins were partly excavated by [[Ahmad Hasan Dani]] in 1960s. There are still many mounds at Mir [[Ziarat]], at Rajar and [[Shahr-i-Napursan]] which are still unexcavated.

The city of Pushkalavati was situated at the confluence of [[Swat River|Swat]] and Kabul rivers. Three different branches of Kabul river meet there. That specific place is still called Prang and considered sacred. A grand graveyard is situated to the north of Prang where the local people bring their dead for burial. This graveyard is considered to be among the largest graveyards in the world.

==Pushkalavati in the Ramayana==
In the concluding portion of the ([[Ramayana]]) Uttarakhanda or Supplemental Book (chaps. 101, 113-41, 200), the descendants of [[Rama]] and his brothers are described as the founders of the great cities and kingdoms which flourished in Western India.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=k8kGAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Pushkalavati+uttarakhanda&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Pushkalavati+uttarakhanda  Gandhara and Its Art Tradition, Ajit Ghose, Mahua Publishing Company, 1978, p. 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] the brother of [[Rama]] had two sons, Taksha and Pushkala. The former founded Taksha-sila or Taxila, to the east of the [[Indus]], and known to Alexander and the Greeks as [[Taxila]]. The latter founded Pushkala-vati or Pushkalavati, to the west of the Indus, and known to Alexander and the Greeks as Peukelaotis. Thus the sons of Bharat are said to have founded kingdoms which flourished on either side of the Indus river.

[[Antarctica]] has various places of worship and an increasing demand for religious services and construction of [[sacred architecture]] on the continent. In spite of the famous saying "below [[40th parallel south|40 degrees south]] there is no law; below [[50th parallel south|50 degrees south]] there is no God"&lt;ref&gt;Melinda Mueller: ''What the Ice Gets: Shackleton's Antarctic Expedition 1914–1916'', Van West &amp; Co., 2000, {{ISBN|0-9677021-1-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the exploration of the continent was in fact closely connected to religious activities with contributions from many adherents (e.g. [[Jesuit]] geophysicists). Some of the early religious buildings are now protected as important historical monuments.
Christian buildings are the only religious buildings on the continent.

== Beginnings ==
[[File:Memorial Cross at Cape Evans.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial cross at [[Cape Evans]]]]

A cross on Wind Vane Hill, Cape Evans, was erected by the Ross Sea Party, led by Captain Aeneas Mackintosh, of Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]’s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 1914–1917, in memory of three members of the party who died in the vicinity in 1916. The cross has been designated a [[Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica|Historic Site or Monument]] (HSM 17), following a proposal by New Zealand and the United Kingdom to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting]].&lt;ref name=ats/&gt;

The first complete religious service in Antarctica was performed in 1947 by [[William Menster]] (1913–2007), [[Lieutenant Commander]] of the [[United States Navy]] during [[Operation Highjump]].&lt;ref name="menster"&gt;William Menster, Strong Men South, 1949 Bruce Pub. Co. Milwaukee&lt;/ref&gt; During a Catholic  service held in a tent set up on land, he consecrated Antarctica. Ministering to approximately 2,000 men from a variety of Christian denominations gave him experience in leading ecumenical services.

Although they are used mostly for Christian worship, the [[Chapel of the Snows]] has also been used for [[Buddhist]] and [[Bahai]] ceremonies. Some of the buildings are among historically important sites and under protection, such as the Chilean [[Captain Arturo Prat Base]]'s wooden cross and a Statue of Our Lady of the Carmel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ats.aq/devPH/apa/ep_protected_detail.aspx?type=1&amp;id=112&amp;lang=e HSM 35: Virgin of Carmen Statue] in Antarctic Protected Areas Database)&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1900, whaling stations and expedition camps were erected in the larger area. After World War II, some military expeditions explored the region. The [[International Geophysical Year]] (1957–1958) marked the end of a long period during the Cold War when scientific interchange between East and West had been seriously interrupted and has since contributed to civil scientific exploration. Since the 1950s, most stations in Antarctica have been constructed exclusively for scientific research. Extended stays in the region can be an extremely stressful experience for the researchers who often have been separated from their families for months at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Geology and Religion: A History of Harmony and Hostility, Martina Kölbl-Ebert, S. 142, Geological Society, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Jesuits, which have had a long tradition of geophysical research in Antarctica, contributed as well to the early Antarctic missions. Notable Jesuit seismicity scholars like Edward A. Bradley (compare [[Bradley Nunatak]]), Henry F. Birkenhauer (compare [[Birkenhauer Island]]) and J. Joseph Lynch and Daniel J. Linehan have been among those.&lt;ref&gt;William H.K. Lee, Paul Jennings, Carl Kisslinger, Hiroo Kanamori: ''International Handbook of Earthquake &amp; Engineering Seismology'', Teil 1, Academic Press, 27.

The first churches south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]] and north of 60° S latitude (and thus not part of the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]) are [[Notre-Dame des Vents]] at [[Port-aux-Français]] on the main island of [[Kerguelen Islands|Kerguelen]] and the [[Norwegian Lutheran Church (Grytviken, South Georgia)]], a [[Church of Norway|Lutheran]] [[chapel]] in [[Grytviken]], [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] (since 1913). After years of abandonment and weathering the harsh elements of the region (roof damaged in 1994), the Grytviken church was renovated by the keepers of [[South Georgia Museum]] and volunteers in 1996–1998 and now serves for occasional church services and marriage ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/An/SubAntarctic/SouthGeorgia/GrytvikenChurch.htm|title=Grytviken Church (Whalers Church)|publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some churches north of the Antarctic Convergence serve Antarctic territories, such as the [[Christ Church Cathedral (Falkland Islands)|Christ Church Cathedral]] in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], which is the southernmost Anglican cathedral in the world.  It serves as the parish church not only for the Falkland Islands, but also [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] and the [[British Antarctic Territory]]. [[Punta Arenas]] in the southern tip of the South American mainland (just north of Tierra del Fuego) also has a Roman Catholic cathedral, which serves the [[Chilean Antarctic Territory]].

Christians have increasingly turned toward Internet communications for fellowship in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/24/priests-no-longer-needed-as-digital-antarctica-embraces-online-religion |title= Priests No Longer Needed as Digital Antarctica Embraces Online Religion |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]], syndicated by [[Australian Associated Press]] |date=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of nearly 90 stations in Antarctica, half are only used in summer months. Most research stations have a small meeting room dual-purposed for religious assemblies.&lt;ref name =walk&gt;Gabrielle Walker: ''Antarctica: An Intimate Portrait of a Mysterious Continent'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013, {{ISBN|0-15-101520-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger stations and communities use a separate room, often a makeshift steel container for religious purposes.&lt;ref name =walk/&gt;

The [[Chapel of the Snows, Antarctica|Chapel of the Snows]] was erected in 1956 as a Christian chapel used by several denominations, at [[McMurdo Station]], [[Ross Island]]. The Chapel offers various Protestant and Catholic services, but also allows for meetings of other religions, such as Latter Day Saints, [[Bahai]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and is used as well for secular groups (e.g. [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]). The chapel had been rebuilt after a fire in 1978 and was reconsecrated in 1989. 

=== Catholic sites ===
The majority of Catholic Antarctic sites exist due to the Argentine and Chilean presence on the Continent. The Worldwide Antarctic Program proposes building a Catholic chapel at [[Mario Zucchelli Station]], [[Terra Nova Bay]], Antarctica; while the first Catholic chapel (named after [[Saint Francis of Assisi]]) was built in 1976 at the Argentine [[Esperanza Base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuevaalejandria.com/antartida/base_esperanza.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518065204/http://www.nuevaalejandria.com/antartida/base_esperanza.htm |archivedate=2007-05-18 |df= }} [http://www.laautenticadefensa.com.ar/noticias.php?sid=12309] www.marambio.aq/esperanza.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The southernmost Christian chapel (in fact, the southernmost place of worship of any religion) lies at the Argentine [[Belgrano II]] Base at [[Coats Land]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://desperatepastor.blogspot.com/2010/03/be-grateful-for-your-place-of-worship.html Inside the Belgrano II Chapel]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a permanent Catholic chapel made entirely of ice.&lt;ref&gt;Worldwide Antarctic Program [http://www.waponline.it/ChurchinAntarctica/tabid/65/Default.aspx Church in Antarctica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722065855/http://www.waponline.it/ChurchinAntarctica/tabid/65/Default.aspx |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further dedicated religious buildings are the [[Chapel of Santisima Virgen de Lujan, Antarctica]], a Catholic chapel at [[Marambio Base]], [[Seymour Island]], San Francisco de Asis Chapel, a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] chapel at [[Esperanza Base]], [[Antarctic Peninsula]] and Santa Maria Reina de la Paz Church, a Catholic church at the [[Villa Las Estrellas]], [[South Shetland Islands]]. Santa María Reina de la Paz is a repurposed container allowing for 36 persons to convene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waponline.it/ChurchinAntarctica/tabid/65/Default.aspx Church in Antarctica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722065855/http://www.waponline.it/ChurchinAntarctica/tabid/65/Default.aspx |date=2011-07-22 }} www.waponline.it&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small Catholic shrine near McMurdo Station called "Our Lady of the Snows." Popularly known as "Roll Cage Mary," the shrine was dedicated to a United States Navy [[Seabee]] who was killed during the construction of the station. It has been maintained by [[Carmelite]] nuns in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigblueglobe.blogspot.com/2007/09/roll-cage-mary.html Roll Cage Mary] bigblueglobe.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eastern Orthodox Christian revival ===
[[Image:2005-02-25 Trinity Church at Bellingshaussen, Antarctica.jpg|thumb|A view of Trinity Church, 2005.]]

Religious activities were halted during the [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]]. However, this changed with the fall of the Soviet Union and the Communism within [[Central and Eastern Europe]].

The [[St. Ivan Rilski Chapel|St.&amp;nbsp;Ivan Rilski Chapel]], a [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Orthodox]] chapel at [[St. Kliment Ohridski Base]], [[South Shetland Islands]] was built in 2003 and is the first Eastern Orthodox edifice in Antarctica, and was the southernmost Eastern Orthodox building of worship in the world till 2011 when St Volodymyr ([[Vladimir the Great]]) Chapel at Ukrainian [[Vernadsky Research Base]] was erected. 

The [[Buromsky Island]] cemetery belongs among the most important monuments in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ats.aq/devPH/apa/ep_protected_detail.aspx?type=1&amp;id=88&amp;lang=e HSM 9: Buromsky Island Cemetery] Antarctic Protected Areas Database&lt;/ref&gt; A Russian orthodox cross has been erected in the meanwhile to mark the site. The island holds a [[cemetery]] for about 60 citizens of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[German Democratic Republic]] and [[Switzerland]] who died in the performance of their duties while serving as members of Soviet and Russian Antarctic expeditions. It has been designated a [[Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica|Historic Site or Monument]] (HSM 9) following a proposal by Russia to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting]].&lt;ref name=ats&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ats.aq/documents/ATCM35/WW/atcm35_ww003_e.pdf|title= List of Historic Sites and Monuments approved by the ATCM (2012)|accessdate=2013-10-25 |work= |first= |last= |publisher=Antarctic Treaty Secretariat |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sāma is composition of words in Rigvedic hymns from notes. The hymns of Rigveda form the base of ''Sāmagāna''. Sāmagāna is not merely a name given to singing hymns of Veda but represents the philosophy and science of uniting thought, sound and music. Sāmagāna is purpose of creation of [[Samaveda]].

==Sāma Veda==
Sāma is singing of hymns from [[Rigveda]] alone and not from other Veda-s. "richi adhyoodham sama" ऋचि अध्यूढ्रम साम (Chhandog Upnishad 1.6.1). Hence Sāma is composition of words in Rigvedic hymns into notes. The richā-s or hymns of Rigveda are called yoni or ādhāra as they form the base of Sāmagān. In musicological parlance Sāma Veda has taken mātu (words) from Rigveda and provided dhātu (notes) to these words. (Bharatiya Sangeet Ka Itihaas. Dr. Thakur Jaidev Singh. Calcutta: Sangeet Research Academy, 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;35 – 72)

==Parts of Sāma Veda==
Ārchika.आर्चिक् Only a few hymns in Sāma Veda Samhita were not based upon richa-s taken from Rigveda. The bulk being based on Rigveda is known as Ārchika. It has two parts.

Poorvārchika. पूर्वार्चिक 585 Richa-s are sub-grouped into 6 Prapāthaka-s. Each Prapāthaka has two Ardha-s. Each Ardha has 10 Dashati-s. A collection of ten (here, hymns) is called a Dashati.

Uttarārchika. उत्तरार्चिक It has 1225 richa-s contained in 9 Prapāthaka-s, first five having two ardha-s each and the remaining four having three ardha-s each.

Āranyaka Samhita. अरण्यक सम्हिता It is merely a collection of verses that could be sung.

==Branches of Sāma==
Patanjali's statement, "sahasravartma samvedaha" सहस्रवर्त्म समवेदः gives rises to speculation that there were a thousand branches of Sām, while he poetically indicated there could be a thousand ways in which Sāma could be sung. In 'Sāmatarpana' there are a maximum of 13 Āchārya-s but today there are only three branches.
1. Rān#aneeya राणानीय
2. Kouthumeeya कौथ्हुमीय
3. Jaimineeya जैमिनीय

==Relationship of Ārchika and Gāna-grantha==
Ārchika grantha (treatises) contains hymns that are yoni or base to Gāna or singing. The collections of suitably modified richa-s are known as Gāna-grantha. These are the true Sāma.
Sāma created on richa-s of Poorvārchika are called Grāma-gāna,ग्रामगान् Grāmegeya-gāna, ग्रामगेयोगान् Prakriti-gāna प्रकृतिगान or Veya-gāna वेयगान्.
Sāma created on richa-s of Āranyak Samhita are termed Aranya-gāna अरण्यागान or Aranyageya-gāna अरण्यगेयोगान्.
Sām created on richa-s of Uttarārchik are known as Ooha-gāna.ऊहगान्
The Sanskrit root ooh means 'to modify according to need'. (Caland in preface to PanchaVimshaBrahmin)

==Application of Gāna-s==
Gramgeyo-gāna: Sung in villages or towns.
Aranyageya-gāna: Practiced in solitude of forest. Also called Rahasyageyo-gān.
Ooh-gān: Pragatha-s specially created for yajna on basis of Gramgeyo-gāna.
Oohya-gāna ऊह्यगान: Pragath-s created for yajna on basis of Rahasyageyo-gāna.

There is a difference in number of songs attributed to different branches. Shri Satvalekar in preface to Sāmaveda Samhita has given the following table of songs.

==Grām or Scale of Sāmaveda==
Fox Strangways in Music of Hindustan says, "Vocal scales are conceived downwards. They are so conceived, because the telling notes of the voice in its upper register, and this presents itself, therefore as the starting point for a vocal scale." The Sāyana#-bhāshya (critique) on Sāma-vidhāna Brāhmana establishes that note of Sāma were of nidhana prakriti (diminishing nature) and followed a descending order.

==Swara of Sāma==
In Naradiya Shiksha the seven notes of Sāma are First, Second, Third, Fourth, Mandra, Krushta and Atiswāra. This indicates that initially only three or four notes were used for Sāmagāna.
Ārchika songs were sung on the basis of just one note, e.g. Sa Sa Sa, or Ni Ni Ni. This kind of chanting was well suited to Havana, Mantra-pātha and Japa
Gāthik songs were hymns in praise of deities and used two notes, e.g. Ni Ni Ni Ni, Sa Sa Sa Sa.
Sāmic songs for the first time used three notes. The word Sāmic is taken to mean three notes. The songs were like Ga Ga Re Re Sa Sa Sa.

Apart from these three basic notes, the singers came across a fourth which they called Swarāntara. When they discovered a note lower than the lowest known note they called it Mandra. When a still lower note than Mandra was found they called it Atiswāra. A higher note determined was called Krushta after Sanskrit root Krush (to scream, speak loudly). So the complete Sāmic Saptaka in descending order contains:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! First Note
! Second Note

|Atiswāra
|-
|क्रुश्ट
|प्रथम
|द्वितीय
|तृतीय
|चतुर्थ

|-
|}

To preserve the Sāmik notes, [http://www.omenad.net/articles/sameshwari_t.htm Raga Sāmeshwari] was created. Dr. Lalmani Misra first translated the notes M G R S D N P into Shadja gram—S N D P G M R—and then created a Raga which is performed in the evening.

==Shruti Jāti==
Shruti-jāti is defined as the way in which a particular note could be applied to make the song appealing. There are five with individual signs for three shruti-jāti-s.

==Rishis==
A Rishi in Rig Veda is an author of a ''Rik'', a hymn mantra, derived from oral tradition and direct insight, not from reasoning or intellect. The term Rishi is defined as "rishati jnānena samsāra-pāram” meaning one who goes beyond the mundane world by means of knowledge. Further, some scholars think the root 'drish' (sight) might have given rise to root 'rish' meaning 'to see'.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[Sri Aurobindo]] described Shruthi as "divine recordings of cosmic sounds of truth" heard by the Rishis. The Vedas are thus Shruthis, revealed scriptures.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The Rig Veda contains 10,552 hymns; grouped into 1,028 Sukthas each of roughly ten mantras, spread over ten Mandalas (Books). The Mandalas are of differing sizes. These mantra songs are authored by some 400 Rishis of whom about 30 were women.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Certain texts called Anukramani (also called Anukramanika) serve as Index to the Rig Veda and provide information about each hymn of the Rig Veda. The most well-known of the Aukramani is Katyayana’s sarvanukramani and is dated around the 2nd century.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3537">'''Scapulimancy''' (also spelled ''scapulomancy'' and ''scapulamancy'', also termed ''omoplatoscopy'' or ''speal bone reading'') is the practice of [[divination]] by use of [[scapula]]e or speal bones (shoulder blades). In the context of the [[oracle bone]]s of ancient [[China]], which chiefly utilized both scapulae and  the [[plastron]]s of turtle, ''scapulimancy'' is sometimes used in a very broad sense to jointly refer to both scapulimancy and [[plastromancy]] (similar divination using plastrons). However, the term ''osteomancy'' might be more appropriate, referring to divination using [[bone]]s. Many archaeological sites along the south coast and offlying islands of the [[Korean peninsula]] show that deer and pig scapulae were used in divination during the [[Korea]]n [[Samhan|Protohistoric Period]], c. 300 BC - AD 300/400.

Historically, scapulimancy has taken two major forms. In the first, "apyromantic", the scapula of an animal was simply examined after its slaughter. This form was widespread in [[Europe]], [[Northern Africa]] and the [[Near East]]. However, the second form, [[pyromancy|"pyromantic"]] scapulimancy, involving the heating or burning of the bone and interpretation of the results, was practiced in [[East Asia]] and [[North America]].

Scapulimancy was also mentioned in Chapter 5 of the [[Kojiki]], the [[Japan]]ese Record of Ancient Matters, in which the heavenly deities used this process of divination during a consultation by lesser gods.

It is also a method of divination among [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Serbs|Serb]] farmers, even today. It is probably of extremely ancient origin. More recently, references are found in the memoirs of several warriors who fought during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. Whenever they had a feast, they used to roast [[lamb meat|lambs]] or [[goat meat|kids]], and after the meal, anyone who knew how to "read" the scapula would clean it of any remaining flesh and, lifting it up to the light, would interpret the various shadowy bits showing on the transparent part of the bone. A clear scapula was a good omen. Shadowy bits had their interpretation and by this they used to predict the outcome of a battle on the morrow, death or survival.

In [[Renaissance magic]], scapulimancy (known as "spatulamancy") was classified as one of the seven "forbidden arts," along with [[necromancy]], [[geomancy]], [[aeromancy]], [[pyromancy]], chiromancy ([[palmistry]]), and [[hydromancy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannes Hartlieb]] (Munich, 1456) ''The Book of All Forbidden Arts''; quoted in Láng, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5342">The [[Constitution of Australia]] prevents the Commonwealth from establishing any religion or requiring a religious test for any office:—

: Ch 5 § 116 ''The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.''

The language is derived from the United States' constitution, but has been altered. Following the usual practice of the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], it has been interpreted far more narrowly than the equivalent US sections and no law has ever been struck down for contravening the section. Today, the Commonwealth Government provides broad-based funding to religious schools and also funds school chaplains for public and private schools. All Australian parliaments are opened with a Christian prayer, and the preamble to the Australian Constitution refers to a "humbl[e] rel[iance] on the blessing of Almighty God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/preamble.htm Preamble to ''Commonwealth of Australian Constitution Act''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520151519/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/preamble.htm |date=2009-05-20 }} (Imp.) 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Australian monarch is Queen [[Elizabeth II]], also British monarch and Governor of the [[Church of England]], her Australian title is unrelated to her religious office and she has no role in the [[Anglican Church of Australia]]. The prohibition against religious tests has allowed former Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane [[Peter Hollingworth]] to be appointed [[Governor-General of Australia]], the highest domestic constitutional officer; however, this was criticised.&lt;ref name="hogan"&gt;Hogan, M. (2001, May 16). [http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2001/05/hogan.html Separation of church and state?] ''Australian Review of Public Affairs''. Retrieved 2010-10-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite inclusion in the "States" chapter, Section 116 does not apply to states because of changes during drafting, and they are free to establish their own religions. Although no state has ever introduced a state church (NSW restricted religious groups during the early colonial period), the legal body corresponding to many religious organisations is established by state legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|act|acoaca1960408|Anglican Church of Australia Constitution Act 1960}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|act|lcoavdia1971629|Lutheran Church of Australia Victorian District Incorporation Act 1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been two referenda to extend Section 116 to states, but both failed. In each case the changes were grouped with other changes and voters did not have the opportunity to expressly accept only one change. Most states permit broad exemptions to religious groups from anti-discrimination legislation; for example, the NSW act allowing same-sex couples to adopt permits religious adoption agencies to refuse them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Advocate.com Editors |url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/09/03/NSW_Parliament_Passes_Adoption_Bill/ |title=Adoption Bill Passed in NSW &amp;#124; News |publisher=The Advocate |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130072816/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/09/03/NSW_Parliament_Passes_Adoption_Bill/ |archivedate=2011-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|num_act|aasca2010n66377|Adoption Amendment (Same Sex Couples) Act 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current situation, described as a "principle of state neutrality" rather than "separation of church and state",&lt;ref name="hogan"/&gt; has been criticised by both secularists and religious groups. On the one hand, secularists have argued that government neutrality to religions leads to a "flawed democrac[y]"&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M. (2005). [http://www.hsnsw.asn.au/MaxWallace.html Is there a separation of church and state in Australia and New Zealand?] ''Australian Humanist'', ''77''. Retrieved 2010-10-10.&lt;/ref&gt; or even a "pluralistic theocracy"&lt;ref&gt;Secular Party of Australia. (nd). [http://www.secular.org.au/mnu-viewpoints/mnu-separation-of-church-and-state The Separation of Church and State] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812090044/http://www.secular.org.au/mnu-viewpoints/mnu-separation-of-church-and-state |date=2013-08-12 }}. Retrieved 2010-10-10.&lt;/ref&gt; as the government cannot be neutral towards the religion of people who do not have one. On the other hand, religious groups and others have been concerned that state governments are restricting them from exercising their religion by [[Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001#Criticism|preventing them from criticising other groups]] and preventing them from refraining to do acts that they may deem unconscionable to their faith.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, S.

'''Shimon Attie''' (born Los Angeles in 1957&lt;ref name=rutgers&gt;{{cite web|title=Shimon Attie|url=http://bildnercenter.rutgers.edu/shimon-attie|work=Bildner Center for the Study of Jewish Life, Rutgers|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) is an American visual artist. He was awarded a [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 2008|Guggenheim Fellowship in 2008]], The Rome Prize in 2001 and a Visual Artist Fellowship from Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Advance Study in 2007.  His work spans a variety of media, including photography, site-specific installation, multiple channel immersive video installation, performance, and new media.  Much of Attie's practice explores how a wide range of contemporary media may be used to re-imagine new relationships between space, time, place, and identity.  Much, though not all, of Attie's work in the 90s dealt with the history of the second world war.   He first garnered significant international attention by slide projecting images of past Jewish life onto contemporary locations in Berlin.&lt;ref name=hodes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodes|first=Laura|title=Shimon Attie Projects Past Into Present|journal=Forward|date=November 16, 2012|url=http://forward.com/articles/165439/shimon-attie-projects-past-into-present/?p=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent projects have involved using a range of media to engage local communities to find new ways of representing their history, memory and potential futures.  Attie's artworks and interventions are site-specific and immersive in nature, and tend to engage subject matter that is both social, political and psychological. In 2013, Five monographs have been published on Attie's work, which has also been the subject of a number of films, which have aired on PBS, BBC, and ARD. Since receiving his MFA Degree in 1991, Attie has realized approximately 25 major projects in ten countries around the world. Most recently, in 2013-14, Shimon Attie was awarded the Lee Krasner Lifetime Achievement Award in Art.

==Life==
He was born in 1957 and received an MFA in 1991.&lt;ref name=rutgers/&gt; In 1991 he moved to Germany from his previous home in Northern California, and began to make work initially about Jewish identity and the history of the second world war.  His work later evolved to engage broader issues of memory, place and identity more generally. Shimon Attie
moved to New York City in 1997.

==Critical reaction==

Shimon Attie's work has been extensively reviewed by a wide variety of publications, including features and/or reviews in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, Art in America, Art News, Art Forum, The Village Voice, The Boston Globe, and many others.

Samples include:

Yasaman Alipour, writing in "The Brooklyn Rail: Critical Perspectives on Arts, Politics, and Culture", on Shimon Attie's solo exhibition "Facts on the Ground" at Jack Shainman Gallery in New York City:

"Celebrated for his approach, which blurs the line between installation and photography, Attie has spent his career moving from one city to the next to explore the trauma and history of the marginalized and to reflect on social memory and the construction of Identity.  Seductive, daring, and clever, Facts on the Ground dives into the inherently charged and polarized politics of its subject matter. Attie achieves something profound: he presents a unique opportunity to contemplate Israel/Palestine without the distraction that is simultaneously a manifestation of the limitations of visual of written language and the possibilities of their alliance."  June 3, 2016

Holland Cotter, writing in "The New York Times" on one of Attie's works in the traveling exhibition "Art, AIDS, America":

"…Less familiar work makes the strongest impression, benefiting from the element of surprise.  A beautiful 1998 photograph by Shimon Attie of a life-size projection of a male's image on a bed, is one."   July 28, 2016

Norman Kleeblatt, writing in a cover story for "Art in America" on Shimon Attie's survey exhibition at Boston's ICA:

"Like many other artists in the wake of Marcel Broodthaers, Attie is first and foremost an artist-anthropologist, a practitioner who digs into archives and then reconfigures his nonartistic source material into complicated art works." June 2000

Amei Wallach, writing a feature in the "Sunday New York Time"s on Shimon Attie's public art installation, "Between Dreams and History", in Manhattan's Lower East Side:

"…like the best of evanescent public projects, from Christo and Jeanne-Claude's "Wrapped Reichstag" to Mr. Attie's "Writing on the Wall," this one will animate real anxieties in real time. Not to mention a sense of wonder."   Sept 13, 1998

Laura Hodes in ''Forward'' felt his 2012 show at Northwestern succeeded in creating a space that was at once dream like and a memorial to the dead, involving the viewer in the historical situation: "we become simultaneously the hidden Jew, the marching Nazi, the Dutch passersby, the voyeur and even the medium itself."&lt;ref name=hodes/&gt;

'''Thirukkalyana Ekanai''' was an important part in [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] the religious book of [[Ayyavazhi]], in which [[Ayya Vaikundar]] unified all the [[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]s (souls) of this universe into Himself.

'''Tomás Cipriano Ignacio María de Mosquera-Figueroa y Arboleda-Salazar''' (September 26, 1798 – October 7, 1878) was a Colombian general and [[political figure]]. He was president of Colombia four times. The first time was as president of [[Republic of New Granada]] from 1845 to 1849. During the [[Colombian Civil War (1860–1862)|Colombian Civil War of 1860–1862]] he led liberal forces in a civil war against conservative factions. After the liberals won, a new, federalist constitution was implemented,  which established a two-year presidency, and the nation renamed the [[United States of  Colombia]]. Mosquera served twice as president of the new government. From 1861 to 1862 he served in a non-elected, interim manner, while the constitution was written. From 1862 to 1864 he served in an elected manner. He had a fourth term from 1866 to 1867. Due to the liberal reforms carried out under his leadership, he is considered one of the most important persons in Colombian history of the 19th century.

Due to large facial wounds received during a battle in 1824, he required the use of a metal [[prosthesis]] in his jaw. This affected his ability to speak, which was marked by blowing and whistling sounds. As a result, Mosquera was derisively nicknamed "Mascachochas" ([[Dementia|Gaga]]-[[Mastication|chew]]) by some of his contemporary critics.

== Personal life==

=== Family ===
Mosquera was born in [[Popayán]], on September 26, 1798. His parents were wealthy farm-owner José María de Mosquera-Figueroa y Arboleda and María Manuela de Arboleda y Arrachea, both from prestigious families. His brother [[Joaquín Mosquera|Joaquín]] was President of [[Gran Colombia]], his brother Manuel José was Archbishop of [[Archbishopric of Bogotá|Bogotá]], and his brother Manuel María was a diplomat.

=== Marriage and Children ===
General Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera married twice. As was the custom among bourgeoisie at the time, both times he married maternal relatives. His first marriage was to Mariana Benvenuta Arboleda Arroyo, but it has been characterized as unhappy as a result of the frequent cheating of Mosquera, who had a number of children outside of marriage. When Mariana died, he contracted marriage on 1872 to María Ignacia Arboleda Arboleda. Mosquera was 78 at the time, and reportedly when he proposed to her he said, 'Would you like to be the widow of General Mosquera?' In total he had eight children (with: Mariana Arboleda -Anibal Mosquera and Amalia Mosquera-; María Ignacia Arboleda -José Bolívar Mosquera-; Paula Luque -Clelia Mosquera, Teodulia Mosquera, Isabel Mosquera-; María Lorza -María Engracia Mosquera-; Candelaria Cervantes -Tomás Cervantes Mosquera-).

=== Academic life ===
Mosquera was a self-taught mathematician, historian, and writer, well-versed in [[Latin]], English, French and Italian and wrote different books about philosophy and politics that have academical recognition.

== Military and political career==

=== Beginnings ===
[[File:Tomas Cipriano de Mosquera-Busto-Medellin.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Bust of Tomas Cipriano de Mosquera, in Medellín, Colombia]]

Already by 1814 he was involved in the independence movement and he was under command of General [[Simón Bolívar]]. By 1824 he had already been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and in that year he battled the royalist Spanish Army under the command of Lieutenant Colonel [[Agustín Agualongo]], in Barbacoas, ([[Nariño]]). It was in this battle that he received the shot that broke his lower jaw and impaired his speech, and that made him the object of the infamous nickname of "Mascachochas." His prowess in battle was awarded by a promotion to colonel, and he became governor of a number of provinces in the southwest of the country ([[Buenaventura (Valle del Cauca)|Buenaventura]], [[Guayaquil]], [[Cauca (Colombia)|Cauca]]), at the same time raising among the ranks, and being promoted to general in 1829.

Mosquera was a diplomat in [[Perú]] between 1829 and 1830, and subsequently he was a diplomat in various countries in Europe and in the United States (1830–1833). At his return he became a congressman (1834–1837), and later Secretary of War for the conservative government of [[José Ignacio de Márquez]]. As secretary of war, Mosquera commanded and was victorious in the [[War of the Supremes]] in 1840. He was later sent as ambassador to [[Perú]], [[Chile]] and [[Bolivia]], between 1842 and 1845.

=== First Presidential Term (1845–1849) ===

In 1845, the so-called ministerial sector (who later would form the Conservative Party) supported Mosquera as a candidate for Presidency, and he was victorious. During his administration he emphasized economic opening up. In 1846 his administration signed the [[Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty]] with the United States. He also was influential in the suppression of remnant colonial taxes, and reinvigorated the tobacco industry. It was also during his term that the [[International System of Units]] was implemented. Mosquera also started political measures to separate the State and Catholic Church. He also hired [[Thomas Reed (architect)|Thomas Reed]] to direct the building of [[Capitolio Nacional]]. His administration was also first one in the history of the Country to conduct a census. Finally, he promoted steam navigation over the [[Magdalena River]], when he authorized in 1849 that exports could pass by the port of [[Barranquilla]].

His political measures were frowned upon by the sectors that had previously supported him in his presidential election, and he was much closer to liberals. By the end of his term he moved to New York city to devote in his family business, and he created an international trade house in there which went bankrupt. While in New York, he wrote his 'Memoria sobre geografía física y política de Nueva Granada', one of his many treatises in Colombian geography. He was member of a number of scientific societies in Latin America and Europe. He went back to Colombia some years later to fight the so-called artisans' revolution, and to defeat the dictatorship of [[José María Melo]] in 1854. By then he had fully converted to the liberal party, and as such he was a representative and senator in the Congress, as well as a candidate to presidential reelection in 1857, which he lost to conservative [[Mariano Ospina Rodríguez]]. With the creation of [[Granadine Confederation]], Mosquera was elected president of the [[Cauca State]], a position from which he made opposition to president Ospina, to whom he accused of disrespecting the states' autonomy.

=== Civil War 1860–1862 ===
[[File:Patio Mosquera.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Statue of Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera by Ferdinand von Miller (1883) in the National Capitol in ([[Bogotá]]).]]
In 1860 Mosquera declared the secession of the [[Cauca State]] and declared war to the Granadine Confederation. He soon received support from the states of [[Santander State|Santander]] and [[Tolima Department|Tolima]], which proclaimed him governor. After heavy battles [[Colombian Civil War (1860–1862)|Colombian Civil War]], Mosquera was able to seize the power in 1861, after which he promoted the creation of the [[United States of Colombia]].

=== Second and Third Presidential Terms (1861–1864) ===

During his second term as president (1861–1863), Mosquera enacted a number of decrees aimed to control the power of Catholic Church, selling a lot of its properties -to impulse the economy giving them to the poor Colombian people-, and banning Jesuits from the country for their open support for the Conservative faction. Despite some dissent, a federal and liberal constitution was proclaimed that guaranteed rights to citizens and was supported by all the signers. It was decided that Mosquera should complete the first two-year term as President of the United States of Colombia, until April 1864.

This third term included a war to [[Ecuador]] in 1863, and he commanded personally the Colombian army to victory. This would be the only international conflict to date between the two countries. At the end of his term he travelled to Paris as ambassador.

=== Fourth Presidential Term (1866–1867), retirement and death ===
In 1866 Mosquera went back to Colombia, to be elected President for the fourth time, despite the opposition of radical liberals. Nevertheless, tensions with the Catholic Church led to strong intervention by [[Pope Pius IX]], and his use of dictatorial measures (such as the closing of the ordinary sessions of Congress in 1867) led the opposition to orchestrate a coup d'état on May 23, 1867. His enemies were besides aware that Mosquera was ready to sue corrupted politicians that had taken advantage of the properties that belonged to the Catholic Church and were assigned to the poor ones. He was exiled for the three next years, during which he lived in [[Lima]], where he wrote his book 'Cosmogonía. Estudio sobre los diversos sistemas de la creación del universo' (Cosmogony. A study of the diverse systems of the creation of the universe). Back in Colombia by 1871, he ran for president again but failed, although he was elected to the presidency of [[Cauca State]] until 1873. He was a senator again in 1876.

He died October 7, 1878 in his farm Coconuco, in [[Puracé]], close to [[Popayán]]. He was buried in the Panteón de los Próceres cemetery in Popayán.
