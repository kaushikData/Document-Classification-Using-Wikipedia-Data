}}

'''''Agostini v. Felton''''', 521 U.S. 203 (1997), is a landmark decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. In this case, the Court overruled its decision in ''[[Aguilar v. Felton]]'' (1985), now finding that it was not a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] for a state-sponsored education initiative to allow public school teachers to instruct at religious schools, so long as the material was secular and neutral in nature and no "excessive entanglement" between government and religion was apparent. This case is noteworthy in a broader sense as a sign of evolving judicial standards surrounding the First Amendment, and the changes that have occurred in modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence.

==Background==
In 1965, [[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act with the goal of providing adequate education to all children in the United States, regardless of individual economic conditions. This service, abbreviated as Title I, distributed federal funds to state governments, which, in turn, disbursed the funds to local education agencies. This funding was to be put towards providing remedial education services for low-income students who were at significant risk of failing to meet state academic performance standards. By law, these education services were to be provided to eligible students, whether enrolled in public school or not. Further, the services offered to children attending private schools were to be "equitable in comparison" to the services offered to children attending public school. All educational services were to be of a secular, neutral, and non-ideological nature.

In 1966, the Board of Education of the City of New York ("Board") applied for Title I funding. In the eligible districts in New York City, 10% of schoolchildren attend private school, and of those 10%, 90% attended schools of a particular religious ideology. To prevent First Amendment complications, the Board arranged to bus private school attendees to public schools for after-school instruction. This plan failed, and another one was adopted, which failed as well. The Board then moved on to a plan whereby public school teachers would be permitted to provide instruction in the private school buildings themselves. A number of stipulations were attached to this, aimed at preventing a violation of the Establishment Clause, including mandatory surprise visits by state-employed supervisors and removal of all religious articles from the room to be used for Title I instruction. This plan was reviewed by the Supreme Court in ''[[Aguilar v. Felton]]'', where it was deemed to create a constitutionally impermissible "entanglement" between government and religion. The District Court, on [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]], issued an injunction, enjoining the Board from following a Title I plan that violated the decision.

After the Court's decision in Aguilar, the Board had to devise a new plan to provide Title I services without creating a conflict between Church and State. This plan involved spending over $100,000,000 in leasing property and vehicles to provide areas for public school teachers to instruct their students. This money, incurred annually over a series of years, had to be deducted from the Title 1 grant before the grant money was to be used for actual services provided, resulting in a net decrease in available funds for remedial education. In 1995, the Board, along with a group of parents of eligible parochial school attendees, filed motions in District Court, seeking an exemption from the Aguilar decision under [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|Federal Rule of Civil Procedure]] 60(b). This rule states, in part, that an exemption from a final judgment may be granted if it is found that it is, "no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application." They argued that cases decided by the Supreme Court between Aguilar and 1995 had eroded the meaning of Aguilar, and that it was no longer good law. The District Court appeared sympathetic, and said that they were pursuing the appropriate method of relief, but denied the motion, noting that Aguilar was still in effect and it was unable to offer the exemption the Board sought. The [[Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] affirmed the denial of the motion. The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] and heard arguments on April 15, 1997. Chief Corporation Counsel Paul Crotty argued on behalf of New York City, marking the last time that the city's chief attorney has appeared before the nation's highest court.

==Arguments==
The [[petitioner]]s argument for relief revolved around three primary points.

* 1. The tremendous costs involved with running their Title I program in accordance with Aguilar constituted a substantial change of fact. They argued that, because these costs were not expected to be so high at the start, it was now imprudent to force them to continue in this fashion. The [[respondent]]s countered by saying that the costs of implementing the program were, in fact, known when Aguilar was decided, which would mean that no change in circumstances had occurred.
* 2. Prevailing agreement in the judiciary had turned against Aguilar, with a majority of Justices having expressed their opinion that Aguilar should be reversed or, at least, reconsidered.
* 3. Subsequent Establishment Clause rulings by the Supreme Court had undermined the legal basis upon which Aguilar was decided. The argument was that, if the case's decision had been so considerably weakened over the years, it was no longer good law and should be reversed.

==Decision==
On June 23, 1997, [[Supreme Court Justice|Justice]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor|O'Connor]] delivered the opinion of the court. The decision was generally divided along ideological lines, with [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]] and Justices [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]], [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]], and [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]] joining the majority, and Justices [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]], [[David H. Souter|Souter]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] and [[Stephen G. Breyer|Breyer]] dissenting.

The Court accepted the respondents' argument that there was no substantial change in factual circumstances. While there was obviously an increase in Board expenditures in maintaining their program, the Court noted that cost increases were not only predicted in Aguilar, they had been practically guaranteed. Furthermore, since the applicable case law had not changed since the Aguilar decision, there was nothing the Court could see as constituting a substantial change in factual circumstances.

On the second argument, the Court again sided with the respondents. It noted that, indeed, five of the Justices had advocated a reconsideration of Aguilar when deciding another case. However, the Court said, this did not necessarily mean there had been a change in their jurisprudence or reasoning, because Aguilar's propriety was not in question when those comments were made. The Court stated that the views of its members, outside of a judgment to this effect, did not constitute a change in Establishment Clause law.

The third argument is given the most examination by the Court. In order to determine if decisions subsequent to Aguilar have actually undermined it or the basis for its findings, the Court examines the cases and the changes in views since that decision was made. The Court notes that it has moved away from the idea that a public employee teaching in a parochial school will necessarily inculcate some of the religious messages inherent in their pervasively sectarian environment. It notes, for example, that in ''[[Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist.]]'' the Court ruled that it was permissible for a deaf student to have a state-sponsored interpreter attend his Catholic high school in the performance of her duties. In this vein, the Court concludes that to consider a public employee's presence in a religious school inappropriate in and of itself would put far too much emphasis on form over substance.

Another change in the Court's approach was that it no longer considered impermissible the use of government money to directly aid the educational functions of a religious school. As long as the money was given without government stipulations as to how it was spent, it was acceptable for such funding to be made available. Citing ''[[Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind]]'', the Court noted that it was not impermissible for the government to give vocational grants, even if the grant would be used to train for some religious job in the future, as long as there was an intervening "genuinely independent and private" choice of where the money would be spent. The Court compared this with a government employee receiving his paycheck, noting that it was certainly acceptable for the government to pay this employee even if it were clear he was going to donate a large portion of it to a religious organization.

The idea of a public employee teaching in a religious school, the Court went on to say, was no longer commonly considered to foster a "symbolic union" between Church and State. Noting that the Dissent believed that, in fact, this did foster such a symbolic union, the Court countered by stating that it cannot be shown that such a symbolic union would vanish once the students and teachers were moved off campus. Taking that reasoning to its logical conclusion, it would forbid Title I entirely, as the union would be unavoidable. Further, the Court rejected the idea that Title I would be financing religious indoctrination if instruction could be conducted on religious campuses; Title I specifically notes that it is designed to "supplement, not supplant" the school's curriculum.

Applying these rationales to the Board's case, the Court determined that the program, previously found unconstitutional in Aguilar, was neither aiding nor inhibiting religion in an impermissible fashion. Reasoning that the aid was distributed according to secular criteria, and offered to all eligible students regardless of school choice, the system of distributing aid was neutral with respect to religion. The program as enacted by the Board did not give any incentive for anyone to alter their religious views.

The Court ultimately overruled Aguilar. It noted that, while [[stare decisis]] is an important doctrine, the Court is not prohibited by precedent to review changes in law or making alterations to previous decisions. It concluded that prevailing Establishment Clause law had changed significantly since Aguilar was decided, making Aguilar no longer good law. In summarizing its position, the Court notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;New York City's Title I program does not run afoul of any of three primary criteria we currently use to evaluate whether government aid has the effect of advancing religion: it does not result in governmental indoctrination; define its recipients by reference to religion; or create an excessive entanglement. We therefore hold that a federally funded program providing supplemental, remedial instruction to disadvantaged children on a neutral basis is not invalid under the Establishment Clause when such instruction is given on the premises of sectarian schools by government employees pursuant to a program containing safeguards such as those present here. The same considerations that justify this holding require us to conclude that this carefully constrained program also cannot reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In closing, the Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals, [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]]ing the case down to them, and giving the lower court instructions to vacate its injunction. Because Aguilar was no longer good law, and the plan constructed by the Board did not create an excessive entanglement with religion, the Court concluded that the Board was entitled to the relief it had sought; moreover, the relief was not simply based on a federal rule, the decision removed the need for the Board to seek the exemption at all.

==Dissent==
Justice [[David H. Souter|Souter]] authored a dissent, in which Justices [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] and [[Stephen G. Breyer|Breyer]] joined.

The dissent was somewhat formalistic in its objections to the majority finding. It stated that the principle of [[stare decisis]] was of too great weight to overrule a previous decision so easily, and that the case presented appeared to be more of a re-hearing of Aguilar than a new proceeding. The Dissent cited the Supreme Court's guidelines surrounding rehearings, accusing the Court of veiling its decision as a "rethinking" instead of a reversal of Aguilar. The Dissent summarized its own position, remarking:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That cause lies in the maintenance of integrity in the interpretation of procedural rules, preservation of the responsive, non agenda setting character of this Court, and avoidance of invitations to reconsider old cases based on "speculat[ions] on chances from changes in [the Court's membership].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In short, the Dissent felt that the ruling in this case was contrary to the integrity and stability of the Court, and did not comport with the apolitical nature of the judiciary.

The '''Agreement concerning the Manufacture of, Internal Trade in and Use of Prepared Opium''', also known as the '''Agreement concerning the Suppression of the Manufacture of, Internal Trade in, and Use of, Prepared Opium''', was a treaty promulgated in [[Geneva]] on 11 February 1925. The treaty was ratified by the [[State of Vietnam]], [[France]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Laos]], [[Netherlands]], [[Thailand]], and [[United Kingdom]].

The Agreement stated that the signatory nations were "fully determined to bring about the gradual and effective suppression of the manufacture of, internal trade in and use of prepared opium".  Article I required that, with the exception of retail sale, the importation, sale and distribution of [[opium]] be a monopoly of government, which would have the exclusive right to import, sell, or distribute opium.  Leasing, according, or delegating this right was specifically prohibited.  Article II prohibited sale of opium to minors, and Article III prohibited minors from entering smoking divans.  Article IV required governments to limit the number of opium retail shops and smoking divans as much as possible.  Articles V and VI regulated the export and transport of opium and dross.  Article VII required governments to discourage the use of opium through instruction in schools, literature, and other methods.

The Agreement was superseded by the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].

'''Anti-Heroin Act of 1924''' is a [[Law of the United States|United States federal law]] prohibiting the importation and possession of [[opium]] for the [[chemical synthesis]] of an [[Addiction|addictive]] [[narcotic]] known as diamorphine or [[heroin]]. The [[Act of Congress]] amended the Smoking Opium Exclusion Act of 1909 which authorized the importation of the [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] [[Papaver somniferum|plant]] for medicinal purposes utilizing an [[opium pipe]] or [[Opium lamp|vaporization]] to consume the [[Euphoria|euphoric]] [[opiate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/60/publaw-221.pdf |title=Smoking Opium Exclusion Act of 1909 - P.L. 60-221 |work=35 Stat. 614 ~ House Bill 27427 |date=February 9, 1909 |publisher=Legis★Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The H.R. 7079 [[Bill (law)|legislation]] was passed by the 68th United States Congressional session and enacted into law by the 30th President of the United States Calvin Coolidge on June 7, 1924.

==Repeal of Anti-Heroin Act==
The 1924 [[Public law|United States public law]] was repealed by the enactment of [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970|Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act]] on October 27, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2015-title21/pdf/USCODE-2015-title21-chap13-subchapII.pdf |title=21 U.S.C. ~ Subchapter II - Import and Export § 952 |work=Title 21 - Food and Drugs ~ Chapter 13 - Drug Abuse Prevention and Control |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Conference on Narcotic Education== 
[[File:GlycoHeroin.jpg|thumb|100px|left]]
The [[League of Nations]] and [[United States]] began participating in world narcotic conferences in the early 1900s. In 1924, United States House of Representatives passed a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] for international conferences better known as [[International Opium Convention|The Hague Opium Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/68/pubres-20.pdf |title=Opium and Narcotic Drugs Control Conferences ~ Public Resolution 68-20 |date=May 15, 1924 |series=43 Stat. 119 ~ House Joint Resolution 195 |publisher= Legis★Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, [[69th United States Congress]] held hearings on a House resolution for the United States participation in the first narcotic education conference to be conducted in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] from July 5 to July 9, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Middlemiss |first=Herbert Samuel |year=1926 |title=Narcotic Education: Proceedings of the First World Conference on Narcotic Education, July 5-9, 1926, Philadelphia |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=H.S. Middlemiss |pages=1-403 |oclc=2736915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, the World Conference on Narcotic Education meetings were held at the [[Hotel McAlpin]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] where the [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|31st President of the United States]] Herbert Hoover issued public statements stressing narcotic drugs as a "fearful menace" and a "menace to society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=22523 |title=Herbert Hoover: "Message to the World Conference on Narcotic Education.," February 21, 1930 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=22987 |title=Herbert Hoover: "Message to the World Conference on Narcotic Education.," February 20, 1931 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=23451 |title=Herbert Hoover: "Message to the World Conference on Narcotic Education.," February 18, 1932 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6634">The '''Basoche''' was the [[guild]] of legal clerks of the [[Paris]] court system under the pre-revolutionary [[French monarchy]], from among whom legal representatives (''procureurs'') were recruited.  It was an ancient institution whose roots are unclear.  The word itself derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''basilica'', the kind of building in which the legal trade was practiced in the [[Middle Ages]].

It dated{{efn|Esmein, 1911, writes "no doubt", suggesting this is a presumed origin}} from the time when the profession of ''procureur'' (procurator, [[advocate]] or legal representative) was still free in the sense that persons rendering that service to others when so permitted by the law were not yet public and ministerial officers. For this purpose there was established near each important juridical centre a group of [[law clerk|clerks]], that is to say, of men skilled in law (or reputed to be so), who at first would probably fill indifferently the rôles of representative or advocate. Such was the origin of the Basoche of the [[parlement]] of Paris; which naturally formed itself into a gild, like other professions and trades in the Middle Ages.

But this organization eventually became disintegrated, dividing up into more specialized bodies: that of the advocates, whose history then begins; and that of legal representatives, whose profession was regularized in 1344, and speedily became a saleable charge. The remnant of the original clerks constituted the new Basoche, which thenceforward consisted only of those who worked as clerks for the procureurs, the richer ones among them aspiring themselves to attain the position of procureur. They all, however, retained some traces of their original conditions. "They are admitted," writes an 18th-century author, "to plead before M. le lieutenant civil ''sur les réferés''{{efn|A procedure for obtaining a provisional judgment on urgent cases}} and before M. le juge auditeur; so that the procureurs of these days are but the former clerks of the Basoche, admitted to officiate in important cases in preference to other clerks and to their exclusion."

From its ancient past the Basoche had also preserved certain picturesque forms and names. It was called the "kingdom of the ''Basoche''," and for a long time its chief, elected each year in general assembly, bore the title of "king." This he had to give up towards the end of the 16th century, by order, it is said, of [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], and was thenceforth called the "chancellor." At this time it is said that the order included 6,000 clerks.{{sfn|Gilman|1905}} The Basoche had besides its ''maîtres des requêtes'', a grand court-crier, a [[referendary]], an [[Advocate General|advocate-general]], a ''procureur-général'', a [[chaplain]], etc. In early days, and until the first half of the 16th century, it was organized in companies in a military manner and held periodical reviews or parades (''montres''), sometimes taking up arms in the king's service in time of war. Of this there survived later only an annual ''cavalcade'', when the members of the Basoche went to the royal forest of [[Bondy]] to cut the [[maypole]], which they afterwards set up in the courtyard of the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]], to the sound of tambourines and trumpets. We hear also of satirical and literary entertainments given by clerks of the Palais de Justice, and of the moralities played by them in public, which form an important element in the history of the national theatre; but at the end of the 16th century these performances were restricted to the great hall of the Palais.

To the last the Basoche retained two principal prerogatives. (1) In order to be recognized as a qualified procureur it was necessary to have gone through one's "stage" in the Basoche, to have been entered by name for ten years on its register. It was not sufficient to have been merely clerk to a procureur during the period and to have been registered at his office. This rule was the occasion of frequent conflicts during the 17th and 18th centuries between the members of the Basoche and the procureurs, and on the whole, despite certain decisions favouring the latter, the parlement maintained the rights of the Basoche. Opinion was favourable to it because the ''certificats de complaisance'' issued by the procureurs were dreaded. These certificats held good, moreover, in places where there was no Basoche. (2) The Basoche had judiciary powers recognized by the law. It had disciplinary jurisdiction over its members and decided personal actions in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] brought by one clerk against another or by an outsider against a clerk. The judgment, at any rate if delivered by a ''maître des requêtes'', was authoritative, and could only be contested by a civil petition before the ancient council of the Basoche.

The [[Grand Châtelet|Châtelet of Paris]] had its special basoche, which claimed to be older even than that of the Palais de Justice, and there was contention between them as to certain rights. The clerks of the procureurs at the ''cour des comptes'' of Paris had their own Basoche of great antiquity, called the "empire de Galilée." The Basoche of the Palais de Justice had in its ancient days the right to create [[Provost (civil)|provostships]] in localities within the jurisdiction of the parlement of Paris, and thus there sprang up a certain number of local basoches. Others were independent in origin; among such being the "regency" of [[Rouen]] and the Basoche of the [[Parlement of Toulouse]].

Its powers faded over the years and towards the end, it had little genuine authority.  It was abolished in the [[French revolution]] by the general decree of February 13, 1791.{{sfn|Gilman|1905}} In modern [[French language|French]], ''basoche'' is a [[Pejorative|pejorative term]] for the legal trade as a whole.

==1988 protocol==
{{Prose|section|date=July 2018}}
In May 1988, Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] and Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] signed a protocol intended to regularize the canonical status of the SSPX.&lt;ref name="LefebvreRatzinger1988"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ratzinger |first1=Joseph |last2=Lefebvre |first2=Marcel |date=5 May 1988 |title=Protocol of agreement between the Holy See and the Priestly Society of Saint Pius X |website=unavoce.org |location= |publisher=|publication-date= |url=http://unavoce.org/protocol.htm|access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990819134353/http://unavoce.org/protocol.htm |archivedate=19 August 1999 |deadurl=yes}} Unofficial English translation of French original.&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the protocol was doctrinal in which Lefebvre agreed that the SSPX would:
*promise fidelity to the [[Catholic Church]] and its [[pope]]
*accept the doctrine of the magisterium found in ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' section 25
*pledge to avoid all polemics and to have a positive attitude of study and of communication with the Holy See
*recognise the validity of the Mass and of the sacraments as promulgated by Popes [[Paul VI]] and [[John Paul II]]
*promise to respect the common discipline of the church and her laws, including special provisions granted to the SSPX

The second part of the protocol was juridical which negotiated rights and responsibilities of the SSPX as a group, and conditions of individuals affiliated with the SSPX that included that:
*the existing SSPX would be canonically erected as a clerical [[society of apostolic life]] of pontifical right within the [[Latin Church]] with special provisions for public worship, care of souls, and other apostolic activity
*the statutes of the canonical society of apostolic life would require approval by the pope to assure doctrinal compliance
*either the local bishops or the Holy See would confer SSPX priests jurisdiction "with regard to the faithful"
*the canonical society of apostolic life would be granted the right to celebrate Tridentine liturgical rites
*lay SSPX adherents would "remain under the jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop" but could request sacraments administered by SSPX priests
*a special seven member pontifical commission, which would include two SSPX members, would be established to coordinate relations with the Curia and diocesan bishops, to resolve problems and conflicts, and to "exercis{{interp|e}} vigilance and lending assistance to consolidate the work of reconciliation and to regulate questions relative to the religious communities having a juridical or moral bond with" the SSPX
*a proposal to licitly consecrate an SSPX member as a bishop would be submitted to John Paul II
*the Superior General of the society of apostolic life would send dimissorial letters to any bishop who agrees to ordain members of the society of apostolic life
*an amnesty could be granted to illicit SSPX places of worship which were erected without the authorization of the local bishops
*convalidation of existing invalid marriages celebrated by SSPX priests could be resolved by decree
*regularization of existing illicit ordinations of SSPX priests could be resolved by decree

Ratzinger and Lefebvre suggested in the protocol that:
*the consecration of an SSPX member as bishop seems useful for "practical and psychological reasons"
*on the doctrinal level, the [[superior general]] should not be the SSPX member who would consecrated as bishop but should be a member of the pontifical commission for stability

The protocol was to be submitted to John Paul II for his approval. However, Lefebvre quickly developed misgivings and declared his intention to consecrate a bishop as his successor, even without a pontifical mandate.&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1988"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lefebvre |first=Marcel |date=30 June 1988 |title=The sermon of His Excellency Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre on the occasion of the episcopal consecration&amp;nbsp;... |website=sspxasia.com |location=Singapore |publisher=Society of Saint Pius X, District of Asia |publication-date= |url=http://www.sspxasia.com/Documents/Archbishop-Lefebvre/Episcopal-Consecration.htm |access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204051026/http://sspxasia.com/Documents/Archbishop-Lefebvre/Episcopal-Consecration.htm |archivedate=February 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meeting took place in Rome on 24 May. It is said{{by whom|date=September 2015}} that John Paul II promised to Lefebvre that he would appoint an SSPX member as a bishop, chosen according to the normal procedures, and that episcopal ordination would take place on 15 August. In return, Lefebvre would have to request reconciliation with the church on the basis of the protocol of 5 May. Lefebvre presented three requests:
*the proposed episcopal ordination must take place on 30 June
*not one, but three bishops, must be consecrated
*a majority of members in the proposed pontifical commission must be SSPX members{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==The Holy See's view==

Following the 1988 episcopal consecrations without a pontifical mandate, Pope John Paul II declared that the illicit consecrations were a schismatic act which "impli{{interp|ed}} in practice the rejection of the Roman primacy" and that all six bishops involved in the ceremony had incurred automatic excommunication under the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]].&lt;ref name="EcclesiaDei1988"/&gt;{{rp|at=n3}} John Paul II wrote, in ''[[Ecclesia Dei]]'', that "the root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete and contradictory notion of Tradition."&lt;ref name="EcclesiaDei1988"/&gt;{{rp|at=n4}} John Paul II reminded "that formal adherence to the schism is a grave offence against God" and schism is a [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P52.HTM delict against religion and the unity of the church] with a penalty of excommunication.&lt;ref name="EcclesiaDei1988"/&gt;{{rp|at=n5}} The individual excommunications of each of the SSPX bishops did not extend to the other SSPX members.&lt;ref name="Caridi2011"/&gt;

===''Ecclesia Dei'' commission===

At the same time, John Paul II set up the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei|Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'']] (PCED) to help SSPX members and adherents who wished "to remain united to the Successor of Peter in the Catholic Church while preserving their spiritual and liturgical traditions" to enter "full ecclesial communion".&lt;ref name="EcclesiaDei1988"/&gt;{{rp|at=n6a}}&lt;ref name="PCEDprofile"&gt;{{cite web |last1= |first1=|author-link1= |date=20 May 1996 |title={{interp|Profile of the}} Pontifical Council ''Ecclesia Dei''|website=vatican.va|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_commissions/ecclsdei/documents/rc_com_ecclsdei_pro_20051996_en.html|access-date=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCED issued many formal written clarifications about the canonical situation of people involved with the SSPX.

===Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts===

In 1996, the [[Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative Texts]] (PCILT) responded to an enquiry from Bishop [[Norbert Brunner]], of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sion|Diocese of Sion]], Switzerland, that "in the case of the Lefebvrian deacons and priests there seems no doubt that their ministerial activity in the ambit of the schismatic movement is a more than evident sign of the fact that the two requirements" for formal adherence to the schism "have been met".&lt;ref name="PCILT1996"&gt;{{cite web |author=Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative Texts |date=24 August 1996 |others=Translation and commentary by Canon Law Society of Great Britain and Ireland |title=The Excommunication of Followers of Archbishop Lefebvre |website=catholicculture.org |location= |publisher=|publication-date= |url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=1224|access-date=19 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919030109/http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=1224 |archivedate=19 September 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=nn5-6}}{{efn|Some statements about attendance at Mass and reception of the sacraments from an SSPX priest are given in {{cite journal |last=Devillers |first=Arnaud |date=Summer 2002 |title=A response to Christopher Ferrara |journal=The Latin Mass |volume= |issue= |location=Ramsey, New Jersey |publisher=Keep the Faith |page= |issn=1064-556X |url=http://www.latinmassmagazine.com/articles/articles_2002_SU_Devillers.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040414032730/http://www.latinmassmagazine.com/articles/articles_2002_SU_Devillers.html |archivedate=14 April 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}}} The PCILT added: "On the other hand, in the case of the rest of the faithful it is obvious that an occasional participation in liturgical acts or the activity of the Lefebvrian movement, done without making one's own the attitude of doctrinal and disciplinary disunion of such a movement, does not suffice for one to be able to speak of formal adherence to the movement."&lt;ref name="PCILT1996"/&gt;{{rp|at=n7}} It stated that its judgment was about the existence of the ''sin'' of schism, since for the existence of the ''canonical crime'' of schism, which entails excommunication, the conditions listed in canons 1323–1324 of the Code of Canon Law must also be met.&lt;ref name="PCILT1996"/&gt;{{rp|at=nn8-9}} While its reply concerned only one diocese, the PCILT said that, if there was serious general pastoral confusion about the canonical situation of SSPX members, the Holy See could issue a general decree on the matter. The Holy See has not yet done so.

===Likelihood of schism===
In 1999, the PCED stated that it was likely, but not certain, that the SSPX members were adhering to a schism, which would mean that they were excommunicated, but that people who, "because of their attraction to the traditional Latin Mass and not because they refuse submission to the Roman Pontiff or reject communion with the members of the Church subject to him", attended Mass celebrated by SSPX priests, were not excommunicated, although, the longer they frequented SSPX chapels, the greater the likelihood of imbibing a schismatic mentality that would seem to involve adherence to the schism and so excommunication.&lt;ref name="PCED1999"&gt;{{cite web |author=Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'' |date=28 September 1999 |title=N. 539/99 |type=letter of response to personal questions |website=unavoce.org |location= |publisher=|publication-date= |url=http://unavoce.org/resources/protocol-53999/|access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621005522/http://unavoce.org/resources/protocol-53999 |archivedate=21 June 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|SSPX clergy and adherents "who take positions regarding both the authority of the Pope, and the validity of the Mass and other sacraments when celebrated according to the post-conciliar liturgical books, which essentially put these individuals in a state of schism."&lt;ref name="Caridi2011"/&gt;}} The PCED judged that documentation sent to it in 1998 clearly indicated the extent to which "many in authority in" the SSPX conform with the formal definition of schism.&lt;ref name="PCED1998"&gt;{{cite web |location=Irondale, Alabama |publisher=[[Eternal Word Television Network]] |website=ewtn.com |author=Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'' |date=27 October 1998 |title=N. 343/98 |type=letter of response to personal questions |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CEDSSPX2.HTM|access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000528222530/http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CEDSSPX2.HTM |archivedate=28 May 2000 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral impediment===
In 1995, PCED explained that it "morally illicit for the faithful to participate in" SSPX Masses "unless they are physically or morally impeded from participating in a Mass celebrated by a Catholic priest in good standing" and added that not being able to assist at a Tridentine Mass "is not considered a sufficient motive for attending such Masses."&lt;ref name="PCED1995"&gt;{{cite web |location=Irondale, Alabama |publisher=[[Eternal Word Television Network]] |website=ewtn.com |author=Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'' |date=29 September 1995 |title=N. 117/95 |type=letter of response to personal questions |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CEDSSPX.HTM|access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000306044305/http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CEDSSPX.HTM |archivedate=6 March 2000 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCED explained that although the ordinations of SSPX priests by SSPX bishops are valid, SSPX priests are prohibited from exercising a priestly function because SSPX priests are not incardinated into local diocese or [[religious institute]]s which are in full communion with the Catholic Church. The PCED also explained that the Masses celebrated by SSPX priests are valid but illicit, and that Penance and Matrimony by SSPX priests are invalid because SSPX priests lack conferred faculties.{{efn|The Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'' reaffirmed various statements in 2003.&lt;ref name="PCED2003"&gt;{{cite web |author=Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'' |date=18 January 2003 |title=Letter by Msgr.

===Separation but not schism===
Apart from the formal declarations by the Catholic Church, Cardinal [[Darío Castrillón Hoyos]], president of the PCED, commented about the status of the SSPX in a 2005 interview that the 1988 consecrations, without a pontifical mandate, created a "situation of separation&amp;nbsp;... even if it was not a formal schism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Castrillón Hoyos |first=Darío |others=Interview with Gianni Cardinale |date=2005 |title=Rapprochement by unhasty stages, but not too slow either |website=30giorni.it |location=Rome |publisher= |url=http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo_stampa.asp?id=9360|access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213203514/http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo_stampa.asp?id=9360 |archivedate=13 February 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castrillón Hoyos commented in 2005, about a 2004 meeting between [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and Fellay, that it was said at that meeting that, in Castrillón Hoyos words, "It cannot be said in correct, exact, and precise terms that there is a schism.&amp;nbsp;... They are within the Church. There is only the fact that a full, more perfect communion is lacking&amp;nbsp;... a fuller communion, because communion does exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Castrillón Hoyos |first=Darío |date=27 January 2006 |title=They are within the Church |website=cardinalrating.com |others=Translation by unknown of Italian television interview |location= |publisher=|publication-date= |url=http://www.cardinalrating.com/cardinal_17__article_2883.htm|access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212195828/http://cardinalrating.com/cardinal_17__article_2883.htm |archivedate=12 February 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castrillón Hoyos commented in 2007, when asked "Does the Indult support ecumenism, 'ad intra' (internal)?" Castrillón Hoyos answered that he "reject{{interp|s}} the term '{{thinsp}}''ecumenism ad intra''{{thinsp}}'." He explained that the SSPX priests and adherents "are not schismatics" since,
{{quote|It is Lefebrve who has undertaken an illicit Episcopal consecration and therefore performed a schismatic act. It is for this reason that the Bishops consecrated by him have been suspended and excommunicated. The priests and faithful of the society have not been excommunicated. They are not heretics. I do, however, share Saint Jerome's fear that heresy leads to schism and vice versa. The danger of a schism is big, such as a systematic disobedience vis-à-vis the Holy Father or by a denial of his authority. It is after all a service of charity, so that the Priestly Society gains full communion with the Holy Father by acknowledging the sanctity of the new Mass.&lt;ref name="CastrillonHoyos2007"&gt;{{cite web |last=Castrillón Hoyos |first=Darío |date=8 February 2007 |title=The President of the Ecclesia Dei Commission, Cardinal Hoyos hopes for reconciliation with the Society of St Pius X |website=blogspot.com |others=Translation by unknown of German interview |location= |publisher= |url=http://cathcon.blogspot.com/2007/02/president-of-ecclesia-dei-commission.html|access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214062629/http://cathcon.blogspot.com/2007/02/president-of-ecclesia-dei-commission.html |archivedate=14 February 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===2009 declaration of no canonical status and no legitimate ministry===
In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed that: "Until the doctrinal questions are clarified, the Society has no canonical status in the Church, and its ministers&amp;nbsp;– even though they have been freed of the ecclesiastical penalty&amp;nbsp;– do not legitimately exercise any ministry in the Church."&lt;ref name="BenedictXVI2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20090310_remissione-scomunica_en.html|title=Letter of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI to the bishops of the Catholic Church concerning the remission of the excommunication of the four bishops consecrated by Archbishop Lefebvre|date=10 March 2009|website=vatican.va|publisher=|location=|publication-date=|access-date=|author=Pope Benedict XVI|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109020201/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20090310_remissione-scomunica_en.html|archivedate=9 January 2015|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of the SSPX was not changed by Benedict in 2009.&lt;ref name="Caridi2011"/&gt; This has to some extent been superseded with regard to the exercise by SSPX ministers of ministry within the Catholic Church, but not as regards the canonical status of the society as viewed by the Holy See.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

On 20 November 2016, [[Pope Francis]] personally extended for priests of the society, until further provisions are made, the faculty by which "those faithful who, for various reasons, attend churches officiated by the priests of the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Pius X, can validly and licitly receive the sacramental absolution of their sins", a faculty he had already granted for the duration of the 2015–16 Jubilee Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_letters/documents/papa-francesco-lettera-ap_20161120_misericordia-et-misera.html|title=Apostolic Letter ''Misericordia et misera'' (20 November 2016)|website=w2.vatican.va|access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confession, along with marriage, requires the granting of the required faculty for validity: "The valid absolution of sins requires that the minister have, in addition to the power of orders, the faculty of exercising it for the faithful to whom he imparts absolution" (Code of Canon Law 966.1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3G.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a document from the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, published on 4 April 2017, local ordinaries are authorized to grant SSPX priests faculties to validly assist at marriages. For validity of marriage, marital consent must be declared "before the local ordinary, pastor, or a priest or deacon delegated by either of them" (Canon 1108).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P40.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This priest, deacon or lay person (see can. 1112) is called the one who "assists" (is present). The one who assists is necessary in all cases except when one who is described as "competent to assist" cannot be found and either of these situations apply: "danger of death; [or] outside the danger of death provided that it is prudently foreseen that the situation will continue for a month". In that case, the parties may exchange consent before witnesses alone (Can. 1116.1).

For any priest, other than the pastor (parish priest) or local ordinary of the parties, to be "competent to assist", he must receive the faculty from the parties' pastor or local ordinary. The 2017 letter from the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith specifically grants local ordinaries (not the pastors) permission, in some  circumstances, to delegate SSPX priests to assist at the celebration of marriages of faithful who follow the pastoral activity of the society. Insofar as possible, the local ordinary is to delegate a priest of his diocese (or at least "a fully regular priest") to receive the consent of the parties during the marriage rite, which is then followed by Mass celebrated perhaps by a priest of the society. If this is not possible and "if there are no priests in the Diocese able to receive the consent of the parties, the Ordinary may grant the necessary faculties to the priest of the Society who is also to celebrate the Holy Mass".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/04/04/new_pastoral_provisions_for_sacrament_of_marriage_for_sspx/1303274|title=New pastoral provisions for Sacrament of Marriage for SSPX|access-date=5 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Holy See and sanctions at the diocesan level===

In 1991 Bishop [[Joseph Ferrario]], of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu|diocese of Honolulu]], declared that six adherents of the SSPX movement were excommunicated for, among other things, procuring the services of SSPX Bishop [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]] to illicitly administer [[confirmation]]. They sought hierarchical recourse from the Holy See to reverse the decree. The Holy See found in a review of the case that the submitted facts of the case were not formal schismatic acts so the decree lacked foundation under the cited canons and was therefore invalid; Ferrario should have, instead, imposed penalties under canon 1373.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|author-link1=|date=|title=Honolulu diocese and the "Hawaii six"|website=sspx.org|location=|publisher=Society of St. Pius X|publication-date=|url=http://www.sspx.org/diocesan_dialogues/honolulu_&amp;_hawaii6.htm|access-date=17 May 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040502040436/http://www.sspx.org/diocesan_dialogues/honolulu_%26_hawaii6.htm|archivedate=2 May 2004|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Bishop [[Marcello Semeraro]], of the [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Albano|diocese of Albano]], Italy, issued a warning that Catholics within that diocese would incur excommunication for attending SSPX Masses or receiving sacraments from SSPX priests "because the society has no canonical status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=3 November 2014 |title=Bishop forbids attendance at SSPX services |website=thetablet.co.uk |location=London |publisher= |url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/1346/0/bishop-forbids-attendance-at-sspx-services|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The society's view==

===Extraordinary jurisdiction===
The SSPX considers itself faithful to the Catholic Church and to the popes, up to and including [[Pope Francis]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The SSPX bishops do not claim ''ordinary'' jurisdiction over SSPX adherents, which would make the latter subject to them, not to the local diocesan bishops,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_PB.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 107] and [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P7.HTM canon 65]&lt;/ref&gt; and would amount to an obvious challenge to the [[Holy See]]'s authority and an act of schism. Instead the SSPX claims to possess ''extraordinary'' jurisdiction. This is of specific importance in Catholic canon law in relation to the sacraments of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]] and [[Catholic marriage|marriage]].

===Absolution of sins and assistance at marriage===
To absolve sins validly, a priest must be given the faculty to do so,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3F.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 966]&lt;/ref&gt; a faculty that, normally, only the local bishop can give.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3F.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 969]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in normal circumstances a marriage can be contracted validly only in the presence of the local bishop or the parish priest or of a priest or deacon delegated by one of these.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3Z.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1108]&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome this difficulty, the SSPX argues that absolution and marriage under its auspices are valid,&lt;ref name="Angles"&gt;{{cite web |last=Angles |first=Ramon |date= |title=The validity of confessions &amp; marriages in the chapels of the SSPX |website=sspx.org |location= |publisher= |url=http://sspx.org/miscellaneous/supplied_jurisdiction/validity_of_confessions_1.htm|access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018145356/http://sspx.org/miscellaneous/supplied_jurisdiction/validity_of_confessions_1.htm |archivedate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of its interpretation of canon law. For example, canon 144 §1 states, "In common error, whether of fact or of law, and in positive and probable doubt, whether of law or of fact, the Church supplies executive power of governance for both the external and the internal forum."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_PE.HTM canon 144 §1]&lt;/ref&gt; Canon 1335 states, {{quote|If a censure prohibits the celebration of the sacraments or sacramentals or the exercise of a power of governance, the prohibition is suspended whenever this is necessary to provide for the faithful who are in danger of death. If a latae sententiae censure has not been declared, the prohibition is also suspended whenever one of the faithful requests a sacrament or sacramental or an act of the power of governance; for any just reason it is lawful to make such a request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P4V.HTM canon 1335]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The SSPX also argues that if one believes they are outside of the church,{{efn|Bishop Chandler Holder Jones of the [[Continuing Anglican movement|Continuing Anglican]] [[Anglican Province of America]], wrote that the SSPX, "now appears to be, by the description of its Superior General Bishop Fellay, Old Catholic. That is, its position is precisely analogous to the status of the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands,&amp;nbsp;... as it has refused definitively to accept the ordinary magisterial authority of the modern papacy."&lt;ref name="Jones2013"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Chandler Holder |date=11 January 2013 |title=SSPX |website=blogspot.fr |location= |publisher=|publication-date= |url=http://philorthodox.blogspot.fr/2013/01/sspx.html|access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920224305/http://philorthodox.blogspot.fr/2013/01/sspx.html |archivedate=20 September 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=seems like a rumor that never materialized|date=September 2015}}}} This opinion has been argued for a recipient who bound to believe that canon 844 §2 applies, which declares that,
{{quote|whenever necessity requires or a genuine spiritual advantage commends it, and provided that the recipient avoids the danger of error or [[indifferentism]], the recipient who is physically or morally impossible to approach a Catholic minister, may lawfully receive the sacraments of penance, the Eucharist and anointing of the sick from non-Catholic ministers in whose Churches these sacraments are valid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM canon 844 §2]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The website ''advancedchristianity.com'' published a tract to support the SSPX opinion, the tract claims that in 1989 Cardinal [[Paul Augustin Mayer]] confirmed this in a letter that the "principle of 'common error', whether on the part of only one faithful or on the part of the community, can be applied in this case, and such acts are thereby valid"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advancedchristianity.com/pages/MPC/Docs/SSPX_Supplied_Jurisdiction.htm|title=S.S.P.X.

Fr. GLOVER, J.C.D. and of the priests of CAMPOS - Brazil - cf. "Cor Unum" #16 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{discuss|section=advancedchristianity.com}}

The Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'' explained that the sacraments of Penance and Matrimony are invalid because SSPX priests are not granted faculty to administer those sacraments, but that the principle of common error applies to the sacrament of Penance, so if a recipient is genuinely ignorant that the priest in question lacks the faculty to absolve. Such private letters to individuals do not have the force of law for the faithful in general. However, "statements of dicasteries and organisms of the Holy See which touch on faith and morals are not considered infallible, but should be taken as norms of moral certitude."&lt;ref name="PCED1998"/&gt;
In a letter dated 23 May 2008, the PCED stated:
{{quote|The Sacraments of Penance and Matrimony, however, require that the priest enjoys the faculties of the diocese or has proper delegation. Since that is not the case with these priests, these sacraments are invalid. It remains true, however, that, if the faithful are genuinely ignorant that the priests of the Society of St. Pius X do not have proper faculty to absolve, the Church supplies these faculties so that the sacrament is valid (cf.

===Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy confessions===
During the [[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy]], which starts in December 2015 and lasts for a year, Pope Francis established that those people who approach SSPX priests to hear their confession during the [[Jubilee (Christianity)|jubilee]] "shall validly and licitly receive the absolution of their sins."&lt;ref name="Francis2015"&gt;{{cite web |author=Pope Francis |date=1 September 2015 |title=To my venerable brother Archbishop Rino Fisichella President of the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelization |website=iubilaeummisericordiae.va |location= |publisher=|publication-date= |url=http://www.iubilaeummisericordiae.va/content/gdm/en/giubileo/lettera.html|access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907212028/http://www.iubilaeummisericordiae.va/content/gdm/en/giubileo/lettera.html |archivedate=7 September 2015 |deadurl=no |quote=... through my own disposition, I establish that&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope also granted all priests "the discretion to absolve" from the sin of [[Catholic Church and abortion|abortion]]&lt;ref name="Francis2015"/&gt; (which usually must be absolved either by the bishop, or by priests authorized to do so by him&amp;nbsp;– there are usually, but certainly not always, many of those made available). The SSPX priests only have the faculty of being able to absolve sins during that Jubilee Year; outside of that time frame they do not have it, and they are still to be considered by Catholics who follow the Vatican to be suspended from all ministries except absolution.

In November 2016 in ''Misericordia et misera'', Francis announced that he had "personally decided to extend this faculty beyond the Jubilee Year, until further provisions are made, lest anyone ever be deprived of the sacramental sign of reconciliation through the Church's pardon."&lt;ref&gt;https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_letters/documents/papa-francesco-lettera-ap_20161120_misericordia-et-misera.html s. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage impediments===
The SSPX provides, for the faithful who request it, a review of marriage annulment decrees emanated from diocesan tribunals, since in its view many tribunals have been granting them without sufficient grounds to do so;{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} in this manner, the faithful can acquire a greater degree of moral certitude when an annulment is doubtful. Critics{{Who|date=September 2015}} have interpreted this service as a usurping of the authority to dispense from marriage impediments and to declare marriage annulments, which belongs to the ordinary jurisdiction of diocesan bishops, and which would be schismatic in kind. This has led some priests to leave the SSPX.&lt;ref name="Neville1997"&gt;{{cite web |last=Neville |first=Robert L. |date=17 December 1997 |title=Letter to Bishop Bernard Fellay |website=traditionalmass.org |location=Richmond, MI |publisher=St. Gertrude the Great Church|publication-place=West Chester, Ohio |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/articles/article.php?id=49&amp;catname=12|access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050313213444/http://www.traditionalmass.org/articles/article.php?id=49&amp;catname=12 |archivedate=13 March 2005 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first=|author-link= |date= |title=Is the Society of St. Pius X in schism? |website=sspx-schism.com |location= |publisher= |url=http://www.sspx-schism.com/main.htm|access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991014015149/http://sspx-schism.com/main.htm |archivedate=14 October 1999 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party inline|date=September 2015}}

==Canonical censures on members==

===The Holy See lifts excommunication of bishops===
Lefebvre died in 1991 as an excommunicated person.&lt;ref name="Caridi2011"/&gt; In their 2008 petition, the four surviving SSPX bishops "acknowledged the supreme authority of the Holy Father, and noted that 'the current situation causes us much suffering'."&lt;ref name="Caridi2011"/&gt; In 2009, the [[Congregation for Bishops]] remitted the excommunication of the four surviving SSPX bishops.&lt;ref name="CatholicEW2009"&gt;{{cite web |author= |date=27 January 2009 |title=Catholic Bishops' Conference statement on lifting of excommunications of SSPX Bishops |type=Press release |website=catholic-ew.org.uk |location= |publisher=Catholic Communications Network |url=http://www.catholic-ew.org.uk/ccb/catholic_church/media_centre2/press_releases/press_releases_2009/catholic_bishops_conference_statement_on_lifting_of_excommunications_of_sspx_bishops|access-date=17 May 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131092743/http://catholic-ew.org.uk/ccb/catholic_church/media_centre2/press_releases/press_releases_2009/catholic_bishops_conference_statement_on_lifting_of_excommunications_of_sspx_bishops |archivedate=31 January 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; "By definition, their request carried with it an acknowledgement of the Pope's authority over the Church here on earth."&lt;ref name="Caridi2011"/&gt; Pope Benedict XVI explained that the SSPX has no canonical status in the Catholic Church for doctrinal reasons and that SSPX ministers "do not legitimately exercise any ministry in the Church."&lt;ref name="BenedictXVI2009"/&gt;

===Suspension ''a divinis''===
Although the 1988 excommunication of the four SSPX bishops was remitted in 2009, the SSPX bishops and priests were still unable to exercise any episcopal or priestly ministry in the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="BenedictXVI2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CatholicEW2009"/&gt;

According to [https://web.archive.org/web/20080327064146/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM canon 1383 of the Code of Canon Law], a [[suspension (punishment)#Roman Catholic canon law|suspension ''a divinis'']] affects SSPX clergy who have been ordained to the priesthood illegitimately.

[[File:Tilden or blood.jpg|thumb|250px|''A truce – not a compromise, but a chance for high-toned gentlemen to retire gracefully from their very civil declarations of war.''&lt;br&gt;By [[Thomas Nast]] in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', February 17, 1877, p. 132.]]

A '''ceasefire''' (or '''truce'''), also called '''cease fire''', is a temporary stoppage of a [[war]] in which each side agrees with the other to suspend aggressive actions. Ceasefires may be declared as part of a formal [[treaty]], but they have also been called as part of an informal understanding between opposing forces.  A ceasefire is usually more limited than a broader [[armistice]], which is a formal agreement to end fighting. Successful ceasefires may be followed by armistices, and finally by [[peace treaty|peace treaties]].

==Historical examples==
===World War I===
During [[World War I]], on December 24, 1914, there was an [[Christmas truce|unofficial ceasefire]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as [[French Third Republic|France]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and [[German Empire|Germany]] observed [[Christmas]]. There are accounts that claimed the unofficial ceasefire took place through the week leading to Christmas and British and German troops exchanged seasonal greetings and songs between their trenches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Long Shadow of Emile Cailliet: Faith, Philosophy, and Theological Education|last=Evans|first=Abigail|last2=Bartollas|first2=Clemens|last3=Graham|first3=Gordon|last4=Henke|first4=Kenneth|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|year=2011|isbn=9781610971126|location=Eugene, OR|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was brief but spontaneous, beginning when German soldiers lit [[Christmas tree|Christmas trees]], and it quickly spread up and down the Western Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/12/24/the-christmas-truce-miracle-soldiers-put-down-their-guns-to-sing-carols-and-drink-wine/|title=The Christmas Truce miracle: Soldiers put down their guns to sing carols and drink wine|last=Brockell|first=Gillian|date=December 24, 2017|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; One account described this development in the following words:&lt;blockquote&gt;It was good to see the human spirit prevailed amongst all sides at the front, the sharing and fraternity. All was well until the higher echelons of command got to hear about the effect of the ceasefire, whereby their wrath ensured a return to hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Heritage of the Great War in Britain|last=Wilson|first=Ross|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409445739|location=Oxon|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;There was no treaty signed during this [[Christmas truce]] and the war resumed after a few days.
[[File:The Liberation of Bergen-belsen Concentration Camp, April 1945 BU4068.jpg|thumb|right|British and German officers after arranging the German handover of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] and the surrounding area, negotiated during a temporary truce, April 1945]]

===Korean War===
On November 29, 1952, the newly [[President-elect of the United States|U.S. president-elect]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], went to Korea to learn what might end the [[Korean War]]. With the [[United Nations]]' acceptance of India's proposed Korean War armistice, the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA), the [[People's Volunteer Army]] (PVA), and the [[UN Command]] ceased fire with the battle line approximately at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]]. Upon agreeing to the ceasefire agreement, the [[belligerents]] established the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ), which has since been patrolled by the KPA and the joint [[Republic of Korea Army|ROKA]], US, and UN Command. The Korean Demilitarized Zone runs northeast of the 38th parallel; to the south, it travels west. The old Korean capital city of [[Kaesong]], site of the armistice negotiations, originally lay in the pre-war ROK, but now is in the DPRK. The United Nations Command (supported by the United States), the North Korean Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, signed the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Agreement]] on July 27, 1953, to end the fighting. The Armistice also called upon the governments of South Korea, North Korea, China, and the United States to participate in continued peace talks. For his part, [[President of South Korea|ROK President]] [[Syngman Rhee]] attacked the peace proceedings. The war is considered to have ended at this point, even though there was no peace treaty.

===Vietnam War===
On January 15, 1973, President [[Richard Nixon]] of the [[United States|USA]] ordered a ceasefire of the aerial bombings in [[North Vietnam]].  The decision came after Dr. Henry Kissinger, the National Security Affairs advisor to the president, returned to Washington from Paris, France with a draft peace proposal. Combat missions continued in [[South Vietnam]]. By January 27, 1973, all warring parties in the [[Vietnam War]] signed a ceasefire as a prelude to the [[Paris Peace Accord]].

===Persian Gulf War===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
After Iraq was driven by U.S.-led coalition forces out of Kuwait during [[Operation Desert Storm]], Iraq and the [[U.N. Security Council]] signed a ceasefire agreement on March 3, 1991. Throughout the 1990s, the U.N. Security Council passed 16 Resolutions calling for Iraq to disarm the WMDs program unconditionally and immediately. Because no peace treaty was signed after the Gulf War, the war still remained in effect, such as an assassination attempt of former U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] by Iraqi agents while on a visit to Kuwait and [[Cruise missile strikes on Iraq (June 1993)|Iraq was bombed in June 1993]] as a response, Iraqi forces firing on coalition aircraft patrolling the [[Iraqi no-fly zones]], U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]'s bombing of Baghdad in 1998 during [[Operation Desert Fox]], and an earlier 1996 bombing of Iraq by the U.S. during [[Cruise missile strikes on Iraq (1996)|Operation Desert Strike]]. The war remained in effect until 2003 when U.S. and United Kingdom forces [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invaded Iraq]] and toppled Saddam Hussein's regime from power.

===Kashmir conflict===
{{Main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948|UN mediation of the Kashmir dispute}}
A United Nations-mediated ceasefire was agreed between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] on 1 January 1949, ending the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]] (also called the `1947 Kashmir War'). Fighting broke out between the two newly independent countries in [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Kashmir]] in October 1947, with India intervening on behalf of the princely ruler of Kashmir who had joined India and the rebels, who were supported by Pakistan. The fighting was limited to Kashmir but, apprehensive that it might develop into a full-scale international war, India referred the matter to the UN Security Council under Article 35 of the UN Charter, which addresses situations `likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace'. The Security Council set up a dedicated [[United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan]], which mediated for an entire year as the fighting continued. After several UN resolutions outlining a procedure for resolving the dispute via a [[plebiscite]], a ceasefire agreement was reached between the countries towards the end of December 1948, which came into effect in the New Year. The Security Council set up a [[United Nations Military Observer Group for India and Pakistan]] (UNMOGIP) to monitor the ceasefire line.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Victoria |last=Schofield |authorlink=Victoria Schofield |title=Kashmir in Conflict |publisher=I.

===Betrayal of the Assyrians during ceasefire===
{{Main|Assyrian genocide}}
During [[World War I]], [[Turkey]], which was an ally of [[Germany]], had its troops stationed both in the Balkan States in the west and at the Russian-Iranian border in the north and east. The Russian army was holding its positions against Turkey in the [[Caucasus mountains]] on the north and at the Turkish-Iranian border on the east, but when the Russian army withdrew from the war zone in this area due to Lenin's Revolution, its army stationed in the Caucasus was no longer there to protect the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]] minorities. The [[Politics of Turkey|Turkish government]], who were angry at the Christians, had been kept under pressure by the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]]. In the absence of Russian power in the area, however, the Turkish Army, under the leadership of General Mustafa Kemal Pasha, who later was named [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Kemal Atatürk]], and his close associate [[Enver Pasha]], had some time to reconsolidate their positions on the two eastern borders.

In the meantime, the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] chieftain [[Simko Shikak]] was secretly working with both the Turkish and Iranian governments for the annihilation of the Assyrians. Simko's hope{{cn|date=July 2018}} was that by annihilating the Assyrians he would get an autonomous rule for his people, who lived in both Turkey and [[Iran]].
Simko requested a [[summit meeting]] for peace with [[Shimun XIX Benyamin]], who was at the time both top religious leader of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and political leader of the Assyrians. Shimun accepted Simko's invitation for a peace mission, and took on March 3, 1918, an entourage after approximately 150 well armed men with him, because Simko was known{{cn|date=July 2018}} to be untrustworthy.
As the carriage carrying Shimun reached Simko headquarters, he was greeted by Simko's guards. As Shimun approached the interior of Simko's inner quarters, the Kurdish leader received him with all honour. The two leaders' discussions were amicable. One of Shimun's men had observed the shadows of some men on the very large roof of the headquarters, not realizing that there were actually several hundred of Simko's armed men hiding on the rooftop and all around the buildings. Simko later escorted Shimun to the gate, kissed his hand, and his horsemen were ready to conduct him on his way. When Shimun and his entourage stepped outside of the yard, Simko's men opened fire, killing the religious leader and about 140 of his men. Of the ten men who escaped, six were wounded.

The Assyrians, who were now left without both a political and a religious leader, fled their homes and villages while being persecuted by the Turks of the [[Ottoman empire]] and the Kurds.

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
An example of a ceasefire in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] was announced between [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian National Authority]] on February 8, 2005. When announced, chief [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Negotiation|negotiator]] [[Saeb Erekat]] publicly defined the ceasefire as follows: "We have agreed that today President Mahmoud Abbas will declare a full cessation of violence against Israelis anywhere and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will declare a full cessation of violence and military activities against Palestinians anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Provisional IRA – British government ===
Throughout the period of [[The Troubles]], the [[Provisional IRA]] and other paramilitary groups have called ceasefires. The most notable of these being the IRA ceasefire which was called on August 31, 1994, and ended on February 9, 1996, with the [[Docklands bombing]]. Another ceasefire was declared in July 1997 after negotiations were reopened.

The IRA traditionally called a Christmas truce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-24/news/mn-5192_1_christmas-truce | work=Los Angeles Times | title=IRA Declares Usual Christmas Truce | date=December 24, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spanish government – ETA ===
[[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] has declared several ceasefires during its long running campaign against the Spanish state. A ceasefire declared in March 2006, was broken on December 30, 2006, when a car bomb exploded in Madrid killing two people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6233431.stm Second Madrid blast victim found]&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 September 2010 ETA declared a ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11191395 Spain's ETA 'declares ceasefire']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charter 88''' was a  [[United Kingdom|British]] [[pressure group]] that advocated constitutional and electoral reform and owes its origins to the lack of a written constitution. It began as a special edition of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine in 1988 and it took its name from [[Charter 77]] – the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] dissident movement co-founded by [[Václav Havel]]. It also has a faint echo of the far more popular mid-19th century [[Chartist Movement]] of [[England]] that resulted in an unsuccessful campaign for a [[Chartism|People's Charter]] and also [[Magna Carta]] or 'Great Charter' of 1215.  In November 2007 Charter 88 merged with the [[New Politics Network]] to form [[Unlock Democracy]].

==History==

===Formation===
Charter 88 was created by 348 mainly [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic]] British intellectuals and activists. They signed a letter to the [[New Statesman]] magazine as "a general expression of dissent" following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 General Election]] victory of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]. This was then followed by further advertisements in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'' . Five thousand signatures were published in ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper in January 1989, followed by the establishment of an organisation.

The organisation was offered space within the offices of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine, then based in [[Shoreditch]]. For several years it was based in offices in Exmouth Market, Clerkenwell. It later moved to the Institute of Community Studies (now The [[Young Foundation]]) in [[Bethnal Green]]. Its initial activity resulted in the creation of a Charter which the public was invited to sign and to support with financial contributions. [[Anthony Barnett (writer)|Anthony Barnett]] was the first Director and Andrew Puddephatt, former General Secretary of [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]], became the director of Charter 88 in 1995.

===Source of inspiration===
Charter 88 was the brainchild of ''New Statesman'' editor Stuart Weir and came into existence as a direct response to Thatcherism in Britain in the 1980s. It closely followed the methodology that had been employed by [[Charter 77]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] during 1977. Charter 77 originally appeared as a manifesto published in a [[West German]] newspaper that was signed by Czechoslovak citizens representing various occupations, political viewpoints, and religions. The manifesto was  reprinted and circulated as a document inviting other signatures and by the mid-1980s it had been signed by 1,200 people.

===The Original Charter 88===
The Original Charter of Charter 88 was explicitly concerned with institutional change:

{{cquote|We have had less freedom than we believed. That which we have enjoyed has been too dependent on the benevolence of our rulers. Our freedoms have remained their possession, rationed out to us as subjects rather than being our own inalienable possession as citizens. To make real the freedoms we once took for granted means for the first time to take them for ourselves. The time has come to demand political, civil and human rights in the United Kingdom. We call, therefore, for a new constitutional settlement which will:
*Enshrine, by means of a Bill of Rights, such [[civil liberties]] as the [[Freedom of assembly|right to peaceful assembly]], to [[freedom of association]], to freedom from discrimination, to freedom from [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|detention without trial]], to [[Right to a fair trial|trial by jury]], to [[privacy]] and to [[freedom of expression]]. 
* Subject Executive powers and prerogatives, by whomsoever exercised, to the rule of law. 
* Establish [[freedom of information]] and [[open government]]. 
* Create a fair electoral system of [[proportional representation]]. 
* [[Reform of the House of Lords|Reform the Upper House]] to establish a democratic, non-hereditary Second Chamber. 
* Place the Executive under the power of a democratically renewed Parliament and all agencies of the state under the rule of law. 
* Ensure the independence of a reformed judiciary. 
* Provide legal remedies for all abuses of power by the state and by officials of central and local government. 
* Guarantee an equitable distribution of power between the nations of the United Kingdom and between local, regional and central government. 
* Draw up a written constitution anchored in the ideal of universal citizenship, that incorporates these reforms.
 
The inscription of laws does not guarantee their realisation. Only people themselves can ensure freedom, democracy and equality before the law. Nonetheless, such ends are far better demanded, and more effectively obtained and guarded, once they belong to everyone by inalienable right. Add your name to ours. sign the charter now!}}

===Support===
Since 1988, approximately 85,000 people have signed the Charter, over which time the aim of the movement has changed considerably.

Among its early supporters in the British entertainment industry was singer [[Billy Bragg]].&lt;ref name="Charter88PDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alamedapublicaffairsforum.org/Charter88.pdf|title=Charter 88|website=alamedapublicaffairsforum.org/|publisher=Charter 88|format=PDF|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRe6_Lk6WIYC&amp;pg=PA271|title=Billy Bragg: Still Suitable for Miners|author=Andrew Collins|date=14 February 2013|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=978-0-7535-4923-0|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had earlier given his support to the [[left-wing]] [[Red Wedge]] British youth political movement. Red Wedge closely allied itself with Labour Party leader [[Neil Kinnock]] in his unsuccessful attempt to defeat the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. The writer [[Harold Pinter]], composer [[Simon Rattle]], actor [[John Cleese]] and actress [[Emma Thompson]] were also early supporters.&lt;ref name="Charter88PDF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCall2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTAFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171|title=Monty Python: A Chronology, 1969-2012, 2d ed.|author=Douglas McCall|date=12 November 2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-1311-6|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other signatories from the entertainment world included actor [[Ray McAnally]], who played the left-wing Prime Minister in the TV film ''[[A Very British Coup (mini-series)|A Very British Coup]]'', whilst other famous names included novelists [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Ian McEwan]], [[Julian Barnes]], [[A.S. Byatt]], [[Margaret Drabble]], and [[Angela Carter]].

Other famous signatories included [[Martin Amis]],&lt;ref name="Charter88PDF" /&gt; [[Melvyn Bragg]],&lt;ref name="Charter88PDF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/melvyn-bragg-anthony-barnett/melvyn-bragg-versus-anthony-barnett-on-magna-carta-today|title=Melvyn Bragg versus Anthony Barnett on the Magna Carta continued|last1=Bragg|first1=Melvyn|date=17 June 2015|work=Open Democracy|accessdate=30 November 2015|last2=Barnett|first2=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timothy Clement-Jones|Tim Clement-Jones]], [[Judi Dench]], [[Terry Eagleton]], [[Antonia Fraser]], [[Clement Freud]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]],&lt;ref name="Charter88PDF" /&gt; and [[Christopher Hitchens]].&lt;ref name="Charter88PDF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWxpkcQUCeo#t=2367|title=Thomas Paine - Christopher Hitchens Lecture|author1=hitch archive|website=YouTube|format=video|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signatory [[Lord Scarman]] chaired the launch in the House of Commons of Charter 88's strategy document 'We can Make it Happen in the Next Ten years', and remained a behind the scenes influence.

The intellectual left provided notable signatories however in the form of [[Ralph Miliband]], [[Robin Blackburn]] and feminist [[Sheila Rowbotham]].

In 1988 [[Neil Kinnock]] is alleged to have described Charter 88 as a movement of "whiners, whingers and wankers", though he and his wife [[Glenys Kinnock]] later signed the charter.&lt;ref name="Foley1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Foley|title=The Politics of the British Constitution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPyt_Kx0HegC&amp;pg=PA179|year=1999|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4552-3|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Blair]] acknowledged his agreement with many of the aims and intentions of Charter 88.

===Today===

In June 2003, the chair of the Charter 88 executive and management committee and active contributor [[Paul Hirst]] died suddenly. Along with this, the organisation's financial situation and a period of resignations and redundancies, created a crisis situation in late 2003.
 
From 2004, Charter 88 developed partnerships with two organisations:
*The [[New Politics Network]] was created in 2000 following the winding up of [[Democratic Left (United Kingdom)|Democratic Left]].
*[[Active Citizens Transform]]', founded in 2004 by [[Charles Secrett]], former Executive Director of the environmental organisation [[Friends of the Earth]] and by Ron Bailey.

On 8 February 2005, Charter 88 and the New Politics Network launched the [[Reform of the House of Lords#Combination|Elect the Lords]] Campaign, which began with an advert in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.

It worked to get the [[Armed Forces (Parliamentary Approval for Participation in Armed Conflict) Bill]] passed through Parliament in cooperation with [[Clare Short]]. In 2006, Active Citizens Transform was wound up and subsumed within Charter 88. [[Local Works]], ACT's campaign for the [[Sustainable Communities Act|Sustainable Communities Bill]] continued successfully and the legislation received Royal Assent in October 2007.

Members of Charter 88 and the New Politics Network were balloted in March 2007 on a proposed merger of the two organisations. The proposal was passed and the new organisation called [[Unlock Democracy]] was established in November 2007.

The '''Commission Directive 91/71/EEC''' was an [[EU Directive]] passed by the [[European Commission]] in 1991 regarding the level of sweeteners, flavourings and [[Food additive|additives]] used in foods by states within the [[European Union]] and banning foods that did not comply. The directive was repealed in 2011.&lt;ref name=lex&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31991L0071 |title=EURLex – 31991L0071 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulations ==
The directive required that all foodstuffs containing colouring, additives or flavouring, within member states in the EU, would have to be identified clearly on the packaging. The directive was an attempt to harmonise the identification of sweeteners and prohibit additives within certain foods.&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite book | first =David | last =Vogel  | title =Trading Up: Consumer and Environmental Regulation in a Global Economy| publisher = Harvard University Press |location= | volume =   | year = 2009 | isbn =0674044681  | page =43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive would come into force in 1994, at which time all foods that did not conform would be banned from sale within the EU.&lt;ref name=lex /&gt;

== Prawn cocktail crisps ==
One particular [[euromyth]] about the directive was that it would lead to a ban of [[prawn cocktail]]-flavoured [[Potato chip|crisps]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver |first=Christian |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6b31460a-d96b-11e5-a72f-1e7744c66818.html |title=Fact or fiction?

The potential ban was later proven to be as a result of a mistake on the part of the United Kingdom's civil service, who forgot to include specifically flavoured crisps when compiling a list of the nation's food items that were to be exempt from the directive. When the food industry pointed out this omission, the mistake was rectified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/ec-to-ban-prawn-cocktail-crips/ |title=EC to ban prawn cocktail crips |publisher=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was parodied in "[[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|The Thin Blue Line]]" sitcom where a French [[EU Commissioner]] stated "You [British] insist on eating prawn cocktail crisps, despite the fact we have told you not to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

The '''Danegeld''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|n|ɡ|ɛ|l|d}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Catherine Sangster; Lena Olausson |title=Oxford BBC guide to pronunciation |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2006 |page=92 |isbn=978-0-19-280710-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Danish tax", literally "Dane tribute") was a [[tax]] raised to pay [[tribute]] to the [[Viking]] raiders to save a land from being ravaged.  It was called the ''geld'' or ''gafol'' in eleventh-century sources.  It was characteristic of royal policy in both [[England]] and [[Francia]] during the ninth through eleventh centuries, collected both as [[Tribute|tributary]], to buy off the attackers, and as [[stipend]]iary, to pay the defensive forces. The term ''Danegeld'' did not appear until the early twelfth century. In Anglo-Saxon England tribute payments to the Danes was known as ''gafol'' and the levy raised to support the standing army, for the defence of the realm, was known as ''heregeld'' (army-tax). Danegeld was mostly taken by the [[Norsemen]] from [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]].

==England==
In England, a [[Hide (unit)|hide]] was an area of land sufficient to support one family. It was a measurement of value and was the basis for the [[Land value tax|land-tax]] that became known as  Danegeld.  Initially it was levied as a tribute to buy off the Danes but when the Viking threat diminished it was retained as a permanent land-tax to pay for the realm's defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=E. |last=Lipson |title=The Economic History of England |edition=12th |volume=1 |location=London |publisher=Adam &amp; Charles Black |year=1959 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Viking expeditions to England were usually led by the [[King of Denmark|Danish kings]], but they were composed of warriors from all over [[Scandinavia]], and they eventually brought home more than 100 tonnes of [[silver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stockholms.lans.museum/runriket/runriket.pdf |title=Runriket Täby-Vallentuna&amp;nbsp;– en handledning |publisher=stockholms.lans.museum |first=Rune |last=Edberg |language=Swedish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216070152/http://stockholms.lans.museum/runriket/runriket.pdf |archive-date=16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglo-Saxon era===
An English payment of 10,000 [[Roman pound]]s (3,300&amp;nbsp;kg) of silver was first made in 991 following the Viking victory at the [[Battle of Maldon]] in Essex, when Æthelred was advised by [[Sigeric the Serious]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and the aldermen of the south-western provinces to buy off the Vikings rather than continue the armed struggle. One manuscript of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' said [[Olaf I of Norway|Olav Tryggvason]] led the Viking forces.{{efn |name="asc1"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=E.V. |title=The Battle of Maldon |location=London |publisher=Methuen's Old English Library |year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 994 the Danes, under King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] and Olav Tryggvason, returned and laid siege to London. They were once more bought off, and the amount of silver paid impressed the Danes with the idea that it was more profitable to extort payments from the English than to take whatever booty they could plunder.{{efn |name="asc1"}}

Further payments were made in 1002, and in 1007 Æthelred bought two years peace with the Danes for 36,000 [[troy weight|troy pounds]]&lt;!--troy pounds were used for this conversion, not sure if that identification isn't an anachronism as well--&gt; (13,400&amp;nbsp;kg) of silver. In 1012, following the capture and murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the sack of [[Canterbury]], the Danes were bought off with another 48,000 troy pounds (17,900&amp;nbsp;kg) of silver.{{efn |name="asc1"}}

In 1016 Sweyn Forkbeard's son, [[Cnut the Great|Canute]], became King of England. After two years he felt sufficiently in control of his new kingdom to the extent of being able to pay off all but 40 ships of his invasion fleet, which were retained as a personal bodyguard, with a huge Danegeld of 72,000 troy pounds (26,900&amp;nbsp;kg) of silver collected nationally, plus a further 10,500 pounds (3,900&amp;nbsp;kg) of silver collected from London.

[[File:U 194, Väsby.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[England runestones#U 194|runestone U 194]], in a grove near Väsby, [[Uppland]], [[Sweden]], was raised by a Viking in commemoration of his receiving one danegeld in England.]]
This kind of extorted tribute was not unique to England: according to [[Snorri Sturluson]] and [[Rimbert]], [[Finland]] and the [[Baltic states]] (see also Grobin, now [[Grobiņa]]) paid the same kind of tribute to the [[Swedes]]. In fact, the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' relates that the [[Rus' Khaganate|regions paying protection money]] extended east towards [[Moscow]], until the Finnish and Slavic tribes [[Vadim the Bold|rebelled and drove the Varangians overseas]]. Similarly, the [[Sami people]]s were frequently forced to pay tribute in the form of pelts. A similar procedure also existed in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], where the contemporary Christian states were largely supported on tribute gold from the [[taifa]] kingdoms.{{efn|The taifa kingdoms paid ''[[parias]]'', a tribute in lieu of raids (''[[Ghazi (warrior)|razzias]]'').}}

It is estimated that the total amount of money paid by the Anglo-Saxons  amounted to some sixty million [[penny (English coin)|pence]]. More Anglo-Saxon pennies of this period have been found in Denmark than in England,&lt;ref name="Jansson 1980, p. 35"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jansson |first=Sven B. |year=1980 |title=Runstenar |location=Stockholm |publisher=STF |isbn=91-7156-015-7 |p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the farm where the [[Viking runestones#Sö 260|runestone Sö 260]] talks of a voyage in the West, a hoard of several hundred English coins was found.&lt;ref name="Jansson 1980, p. 35"/&gt;

===Norman era===
In southern England the danegeld was based on [[hide (unit)|hidages]], an area of agricultural land sufficient to support a family, with the exception of Kent,{{efn|The former [[Kingdom of Kent]] maintained many endemic traditions.}} where the unit was a [[Hide (unit)|sulung]] of four yokes, the amount of land that could be ploughed in a season by a team of oxen;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Hide (unit)]].&lt;/ref&gt; in the north the typical unit was the carucate, or ploughland, equivalent to Kent's sulung, and East Anglia was assessed by the [[hundred (county division)|hundred]]. Everywhere the [[farm (revenue leasing)|tax was farmed]] (collected) by local sheriffs. Records of assessment and income pre-date the Norman conquest, indicating a system which James Campbell describes as "old, but not unchanging".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. |last= Campbell |contribution= The Anglo Norman State in administrative History |title= Essays in Anglo-Saxon History |publisher= Hambledon &amp; London |year=1986 |pages= 172–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Bates, it was "a national tax of a kind unknown in western Europe;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D. |last=Bates |title=William the Conqueror |publisher=George Philip Ltd |location=London |year=1989 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, {{nowrap|J. A. Green}} asserts that the national system of [[taxation in medieval England|land taxation]] developed to raise the Danegeld was the first to reappear in Western Europe since the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Green 1981 p. 241"&gt;{{harvnb|Green|1981|p=241}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used by [[William the Conqueror]] as the principal tool for underwriting continental wars, as well as providing for royal appetites and the costs of conquest, rather than for buying-off the [[Vikings|Viking]] menace. He and his successors levied the geld more frequently than the Anglo-Saxon kings, and at higher rates; the six-shilling geld of 1084 is infamous, and the geld in Ely of 1096, for example, was double its normal rate.&lt;ref name="Green 1981 p. 241"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.O. |last=Prestwich |title=War and Finance in the Anglo-Norman State |journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society |series=5th Series |volume=4 |year=1954 |pages=19–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Green states that from 1110, war and the [[White Ship]] calamity led to further increases in taxation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Judith |last=Green |title=The Government of England under Henry I |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1130 [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] was taxing the danegeld annually, at two shillings on the [[hide (unit)|hide]]. That year, according to the chronicle of [[John of Worcester]] the king promised to suspend the danegeld for seven years, a promise renewed by [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]] at his coronation but which was afterwards broken. [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] revived the danegeld in 1155–1156, but 1161–1162 marks the last year the danegeld was recorded on a [[pipe rolls|pipe roll]], and the tax fell into disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|1981|p=242}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the danegeld to the [[Exchequer]] may be assessed by its return of about £2400 in 1129–1130, which was about ten per cent of the total (about £23,000) paid that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|1981|p=254}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judged by an absolute rather than a contemporary standard, there is much to criticise in the collection of the danegeld by the early 12th century: it was based on ancient assessments of land productivity, and there were numerous privileged reductions or exemptions, granted as marks of favour that served to cast those left paying it in an "unfavoured" light: "Exemptions were very much a matter of royal favour, and were adjusted to meet changing circumstances... in this way danegeld was a more flexible instrument of taxation than most historians have been prepared to allow."&lt;ref&gt;Judith Green 1986, notes: {{harvnb|Green|1981|p=252}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] granted tax liberties to [[London]] in 1133, and exempted the city from taxes such as [[wikt:scot|scot]], danegeld, and [[murdrum]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Roy C.|last1= Cave|first2=Herbert H.|last2=Coulson|title= A Source Book for Medieval Economic History|publisher=Biblo and Tannen|location=New York|year= 1965|page= 367|url= https://www.questia.com/read/7678665/a-source-book-for-medieval-economic-history.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the late twelfth century, a levy on moveables, which required the consent of parliament, replaced the geld. The principle of 'no consent, but exemption', gave way to that of 'consent, but no exemption'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=John Maddicott |first=J.R. |last=Maddicott |title=The Origins of the English Parliament, 924–1327 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |pages=424–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Francia==

===Brittany===
That a country-wide danegeld was ever collected in the [[Duchy of Brittany]] is uncertain. Certainly they were paid off on more than one occasion, and such payouts may have included money (besides other valuables), but the imposition of a tax on the people to pay either a [[stipend]] or a [[tribute]] is not recorded in the sources, although it is possible that some monies were raised this way. It is more likely that purely local danegeld were raised in times of emergency.&lt;ref name="joranson248"&gt;{{cite book |first=Einar |last=Joranson |year=1923 |title=The Danegeld in France |location=Rock Island |publisher=Augustana |pages=248 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 847 the Breton leader [[Nominoe]] was defeated three times by some [[Danes|Danish]] Vikings before finally opening negotiations with their leaders and enticing them to leave by offering them gifts, as recorded in the contemporary ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'':
{{Quote|
''{{lang|la|Dani partem inferioris Galliae quam Brittones incolunt adeuntes, ter cum eisdem bellantes, superant; Nomenogiusque victus cum suis fugit, dein [per] legatos muneribus a suis eos sedibus amovit.}}''&lt;ref name="joranson248"/&gt;

A smaller group of Danes left Gaul intending to settle among the Bretons. Thrice doing battle with the same, they overcame them. The vanquished Nominoe fled with his own, then through messengers bearing gifts removed the same Danes from their settlements.
}}
The possibility that the Danes were bought off by methods other than the raising of cash is raised by an incident in 869, recorded in the aforementioned ''Annales'' and by [[Regino of Prüm]]. In that year [[Salomon, King of Brittany]], put an end to some pagan raids by payment of five hundred heads of cattle.&lt;ref name=joranson248/&gt;

The more local type of danegeld is exemplified by two chronologically close events in the [[County of Vannes]]. According to a record in the [[cartulary]] of [[Redon Abbey]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vannes|bishop]] Courantgenus was ransomed from Viking captivity in 854.&lt;ref name=joranson248/&gt; His ransom was quite probably raised on a local level. In 855 the monks of Redon had to ransom the count, [[Pascweten|Pascwet]], from a similar captivity by handing over a [[chalice]] and a [[paten]], weighing together sixty-seven ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]'' in gold. Sometime later Pascwet managed to redeem the sacred vessels from the pagans, and this payment too may have been raised as a sort of danegeld. Certainly, according to Regino of Prüm, Pascwet later (in 873) paid a stipendiary danegeld of an undisclosed amount to hire as mercenaries some Vikings with which to harass his opponent for the ducal throne of Brittany, [[Gurvand|Vurfand]], [[Count of Rennes]].&lt;ref name=joranson248/&gt;

===East Francia===
The most important danegeld raised in [[East Francia]] was that used by [[Charles the Fat]] to end the [[Siege of Elsloo]] and convert the Viking leader [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia|Godfrid]] into a Christian and a [[Duke of Frisia]] (882).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joranson|1923|pp=239–246}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Local danegeld may have been raised in the Eastern kingdom as needed, such as by one Evesa to ransom her son, Count Eberhard, at a "very great price" in 880, according to [[Regino of Prüm]].&lt;ref name=joranson247&gt;{{harvnb|Joranson|1923|p=247}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frisia===
The first danegeld ever raised was collected in [[Frisia]] in 810.&lt;ref name=joranson236&gt;{{harvnb|Joranson|1923|p=236}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year a Danish fleet of some two hundred vessels landed in Frisia, harassing first all the coastal islands and then the mainland before defeating the Frisians in three battles. The victorious Danes then demanded a large tribute from the conquered. Soon after, a report was sent to [[Charlemagne]], then at [[Aachen]] contemplating a campaign against the Danish king, [[Godfred]], stating that the Frisians had already collected through taxation and paid a sum of one hundred pounds of silver. These events are recorded in the ''[[Annales regni Francorum]]'' and the ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'', both works of Charlemagne's court historian, [[Einhard]], and in the separate ''[[Reichsannalen]]'' called the ''[[Annales Mettenses]]'' and the ''Annales Maximiniani'', as well as the work of the so-called "[[Poeta Saxo]]".&lt;ref name=joranson236/&gt; The total sum paid out is unknown, but it was without doubt raised through taxes, as Einhard in his ''Vita'' explicitly says: "And the victorious Danes imposed a tribute on the vanquished, by means of taxes one hundred pounds of silver from the Frisians is already released" (''Danosque victores tributum victis inposuisse, et vectigalis nomine centum libras argenti a Frisionibus iam esse solutas'').&lt;ref name=joranson236/&gt;

No further danegeld was collected in Frisia until late in the reign of [[Louis the Pious]] (died 840). In 836 some Northmen, having burnt [[Antwerp]] and the marketplace at [[Wintla]], agreed to leave on the payment of some tribute, the amount of which the ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'' do not specify.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joranson|1923|pp=236–237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 837, either because the Frisians were unprepared or defected from their Frankish overlords, some Vikings managed to land on [[Walcheren]], capture several counts and other leading men and kill them or hold them for ransom.&lt;ref name=joranson237&gt;{{harvnb|Joranson|1923|p=237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They then proceeded to exact a ''census'' wherever they could, funnelling an "infinite" amount of money "of diverse kinds" into their coffers. They then moved to the mainland, where they assaulted [[Dorestad]] and extorted a tribute from the population of the region before leaving.&lt;ref name=joranson237/&gt; This event is recorded in the ''Annales Fuldenses'', ''Annales Bertiniani'', ''[[Annales Xantenses]]'', and the ''Vita Hludowici imperatoris'' of [[Thegan of Trier]]. In 846, during the reign of Louis's son [[Lothair I]], the Vikings compelled the Frisians to collect a ''census'' to pay them off.&lt;ref name=joranson237/&gt; The ''Bertiniani'' and ''Xantenses'' annals record how Lothair, though aware of the outrage, was unable to stop it, and the Vikings left Frisia laden with booty and captives.

The last recorded danegeld raised by the Frisians was paid in 852. In that year 252 Viking ships laid anchor off the Frisian coast and demanded tribute (of what kind we do not know), which was procured. Their demands met, the Vikings left without devastating the territory, as recorded in the ''Annales Bertiniani'' and the ''Miracula sancti Bavonis'', a life of [[Saint Bavo]].&lt;ref name=joranson237/&gt; That these various Viking impositions were paid by the taxation of the Frisians is made evident in a record of events in 873. In that year, according to the annals ''Fuldenses'', ''Bertiniani'', and ''Xantenses'', the Viking leader [[Rodulf (Viking)|Rodulf]] sent messengers to the [[Ostergau]] calling for tribute. The Frisians replied that they owed taxes only to their king, [[Louis the German]], and his sons ([[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]], [[Louis the Younger|Louis]], and [[Charles the Fat|Charles]]), and a battle ensued, in which Rodulf was killed and his troops routed.&lt;ref name=joranson237/&gt; One later, tenth-century source, [[Dudo of Saint-Quentin]]'s ''De moribus et actis primorum Normanniae ducum'', records that [[Rollo]] forced the Frisians to pay tribute, but this is unlikely.&lt;ref name=joranson237/&gt; All the various Frisian danegeld was purely local in nature, raised by the local leaders and the people without royal aid or approval.

===Lotharingia===
In [[Lotharingia]] the danegeld was only collected once. In 864 [[Lothair II]] exacted four ''[[denarii]]'' from every ''[[mansus]]'' in the kingdom, as well as large number of cattle and much flour, wine, and beer.{{efn|{{harvnb|Joranson|1923|p=239 |loc=and n. 2}}, indicates that the word generally translated "beer", ''sicera'', is derived from [[Ancient Hebrew writings|ancient Hebrew]] and can refer to any [[alcoholic beverage]] that is not wine. It has been translated as [[Sharbat|sherbet]].}} The whole amount is not recorded, nor whether it was paid as a [[stipend]] or as a [[tribute]], but it was paid to a Viking band led by one [[Rodulf (Viking)|Rodulf]]. It has been suggested that Lothair was imitating the example set by Charles the Bald in 860, when he hired the Vikings of [[Wayland the Smith|Weland]] to attack those encamped on the island of ''Oscellus'' in the [[Seine]]. Neither the reason for Lothair's payment nor the result is recorded in the only source to mention it, the contemporary ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'':
&lt;blockquote lang="la-FR" style="font-style: italic"&gt;
Hlotharius, Hlotharii filius, de omni regno suo quattuor denarios ex omni manso colligens, summam denariorum cum multa pensione farinae atque pecorum necnon vini ac sicerae Rodulfo Normanno, Herioldi filio, ac suis locarii nomine tribuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joranson|1923|p=239}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{Quote|
Lothair, son of Lothair, collecting from his whole kingdom four ''denarii'' from every ''mansus'', allotted the sum of the ''denarii'' with a great payment of flour and cattle and even wine and beer to the Northman Rodulf, son of Heriold, and to his hirelings.
}}
There is also a story told by [[Dudo of Saint-Quentin]] in his ''De moribus et actis primorum Normanniae ducum'' of how [[Reginar Langhals]] was ransomed by his wife in 880 for all the gold in [[County of Hainaut|Hainault]], but this is probably a legend.&lt;ref name=joranson247/&gt;

===West Francia===
The first payment of the danegeld to the Vikings in West Francia took place in 845 when, under [[Ragnar Lothbrok]], they tried to attack [[Paris]]. The Viking army was bought off from destroying the city by a massive payment of nearly six tons of silver and gold bullion. In November 858 a danegeld was being collected, probably to pay off [[Bjørn (Viking)|Bjørn (Berno)]], who had ravaged the Seine and its district for the whole previous year (857).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Simon |last=Coupland |year=1998 |title=From Poachers to Gamekeepers: Scandinavian Warlords and Carolingian Kings |journal=Early Medieval Europe |volume=7 |number=1 |pages=103–104 |doi=10.1111/1468-0254.00019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 862 two groups of Vikings—one the larger of two fleets recently forced out of the [[Seine]] by [[Charles the Bald]], the other a fleet returning from a [[Mediterranean]] expedition—converged on [[Brittany]], where one (the Mediterranean group) was hired by the Breton duke [[Salomon, King of Brittany|Salomon]] to ravage the [[Loire valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joranson|1923|p=59–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert the Strong]], [[Margrave of Neustria]], captured twelve of their ships, killing all on board save a few who fled. He then opened negotiations with the former Seine Vikings, and hired them against Salomon for 6,000 pounds of silver. The purpose of this was doubtless to prevent them from entering the service of Salomon.{{efn|Robert probably expected Salomon to hire them to replace the defeated Mediterranean Vikings, then to attack Neustria from two sides, with the Viking ships ascending the Loire and Breton troops invading by land.}} Probably Robert had to collect a large amount in taxes to finance what was effectively a non-[[Tribute|tributary]] Danegeld designed to keep the Vikings out of Neustria.{{efn|In 860–861 Charles the Bald had collected a general tax to pay a Danegeld of 5,000 pounds. The king had probably authorised Robert's payment.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} }} The treaty between the Franks and the Vikings did not last more than a year: in 863 Salomon made peace and the Vikings, deprived of an enemy, ravaged Neustria.{{citation needed||date=October 2017|reason=for all the facts since the last citation in the paragraph (currently Joranson(1923)}}

==Russia==
In Russia during the rule of the Swedish ''Rus'' (from where the name Russia derives), the Slavs had to pay an annual tribute to the Vikings known as the ''dan'' from at least 859 onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ward |first=Grace Faulkner |title=The English Danegeld and the Russian Dan |pages=299–318 |journal=The American Slavic and East European Review |volume=13 |number=3 |date=October 1954 |ref=harv |doi=10.2307/2491815}} p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]], who was a relative of Rurik the Viking, after moving to Kiev, imposed a ''dan'' on the people of Novgorod of 300 ''griveni''/per year "for the preservation of peace".{{sfn|Ward|1954|p=305}} The payments to Kiev continued until 1054 with the death of Prince Jaroslav of Kiev.{{sfn|Ward|1954|p=305}} When Prince Oleg made his expedition against Constantinople in 907, he demanded that the Romans "pay tribute to his men on his 2, 000 ships at the rate of 12 ''griveni'' per man, 40 men reckoned to a ship".{{sfn|Ward|1954|p=305}} The treaty negotiated between Oleg and the Roman Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]] committed the emperor to pay 1 ''grivna'' to every man on Oleg's ships in exchange for going away.{{sfn|Ward|1954|p=306}} According to the Russian chronicles, the followers of Prince [[Igor of Kiev|Igor]] in 945 : &lt;blockquote&gt;"...said to him "The servants of Sveiald are adored with weapons and fine raiment, but we are naked. Go forth with us, oh Prince, that you and we may profit thereby". Igor heeded their words and attacked Dereva in search of tribute (''dan''). He demanded the previous tribute and collected by violence from the people with the assistance of his followers...".{{sfn|Ward|1954|p=308}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==

===In literature===
[[William Shakespeare]] made reference to Danish tribute in ''[[Hamlet, Prince of Denmark]]'', [http://tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/hamlet/hamlet.3.1.html Act 3, scene 1] (King Claudius is talking of Prince Hamlet's insanity):
{{Quote|&lt;poem&gt;
... he shall with speed to England,
For the demand of our neglected tribute
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Danegeld is the subject of the poem "[[Dane-geld (poem)|Dane-geld]]" by [[Rudyard Kipling]], whose most famous lines are "once you have paid him the Danegeld/ You never get rid of the Dane." The poem ends thus:&lt;ref name="Kipling"&gt;[http://poetryloverspage.com/poets/kipling/dane_geld.html Full text of danegeld]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
It is wrong to put temptation in the path of any nation,
   For fear they should succumb and go astray;
So when you are requested to pay up or be molested,
   You will find it better policy to say: –

"We never pay ''any''-one Dane-geld,
   No matter how trifling the cost;
For the end of that game is oppression and shame,
   And the nation that plays it is lost!"
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Kipling's poem was set to music by [[filk]] musician [[Leslie Fish]] on her 1991 album, ''The Undertaker's Horse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Fish|first1=Leslie|last2=Kipling|first2=Rudyard|title=Songs by Rudyard Kipling, set to music by Leslie Fish|publisher=Firebird Arts &amp; Music|location = Portland, OR|year=1990|type=Music cassette|oclc= 31275334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In politics===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the term "Danegeld" has come to refer to a general warning and a criticism of any coercive payment, whether in money or kind. For example, as mentioned in the [[British House of Commons]] during the debate on the [[Belfast Agreement]]:
{{quote|I feared that the Belfast agreement might be built on sand, but I hoped otherwise. But as we have seen, Danegeld has been paid, and the thing about Danegeld is that one keeps on having to pay it. Concession after concession has been made. What will be the next one?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mr. Andrew Robathan (Blaby) (Con) |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/debtext/51123-32.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 23 Nov 2005: Column 1610 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311144442/http://www.publications.parliament.uk:80/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/debtext/51123-32.htm |archive-date=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To emphasise the point, people often quote Kipling's poem "Dane-Geld", especially its two most famous lines. For example, journalist [[Tony Parsons (British journalist)|Tony Parsons]] quoted the poem in ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', when criticising the Rome daily ''[[La Repubblica]]'' for writing "Ransom was paid and that is nothing to be ashamed of," in response to the announcement that the Italian government paid $1 million for the release of two hostages in Iraq in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=We'll all pay for ransom |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/well-all-pay-for-ransom-540684 |first=Tony |last=Parsons |publisher=The Daily Mirror |date=October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain the phrase is often coupled with the experience of [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain's]] [[Appeasement]] of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].{{efn|"There are many examples of appeasement in history, whether it be the danegeld or more recently, and we know that appeasement does not work" ({{cite web |author=Mr Brady  |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo000125/debtext/00125-30.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 25 Jan 2000 (pt 30)] Column 233}}).}} On 22 July 1939, two British newspapers, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and the ''[[News Chronicle]]'', reported that [[Robert Hudson, 1st Viscount Hudson|Robert Hudson]] of the Department of Overseas Trade had visited the German Embassy in London two days before, to meet the German Ambassador [[Herbert von Dirksen]] and Helmuth Wohlthat of the Four Year Plan Organisation, to offer Germany a huge loan worth hundreds of  millions of pound sterling in exchange for not attacking Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watt |first=D.C |title=How War Came |location=London |publisher=Parthenon |year=1989 |page=400 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media reaction to Hudson's proposed loan was overwhelmingly negative with the newspapers calling Hudson's plan "paying the Danegeld".{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=400}} Much to Hudson's humiliation, Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that Hudson was acting on his own, and Britain would not offer Germany any such loan as a solution to the Danzig crisis.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=401}}

Defensive medicine is a reaction to the rising costs of [[malpractice insurance]] premiums and patients’ biases on suing for missed or delayed diagnosis or treatment but not for being overdiagnosed. U.S. physicians are at highest risk of being sued, and overtreatment is common. The number of lawsuits against physicians in the USA has increased within the last decades and has had a substantial impact on the behavior of physicians and medical practice. Physicians order tests and avoid treating high-risk patients (when they have a choice) to reduce their exposure to lawsuits, or are forced to discontinue practicing because of overly high insurance premiums.&lt;ref name="Studdert"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Studdert D. M. |author2=Mello M. M. |author3=Sage W. M. |author4=DesRoches C. M. |author5=Peugh J. |author6=Zapert K. |author7=Brennan T. A. | year = 2005 | title = Defensive medicine among high-risk specialist physicians in a volatile malpractice environment | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 293 | issue = 21| pages = 2609–2617 | doi=10.1001/jama.293.21.2609 | pmid=15928282}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior has become known as defensive medicine, "a deviation from sound medical practice that is indicated primarily by a threat of liability".

== Forms ==
Defensive medicine takes two main forms: assurance behavior and [[avoidance behavior]]. Assurance behavior involves the charging of additional, unnecessary services to a) reduce adverse outcomes, b) deter patients from filing [[medical malpractice]] claims, or c) preempt any future legal action by documenting that the practitioner is practicing according to the [[standard of care]]. Avoidance behavior occurs when providers refuse to participate in high risk procedures or circumstances.&lt;ref name="Studdert"/&gt;

== Examples ==
In 2004, the case of Dr. Daniel Merenstein triggered an intensive debate in scientific journals and media on defensive medicine (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hurwitz B | year = 2004 | title = How does evidence based guidance influence determinations of medical negligence? | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 329 | issue = 7473| pages = 1024–1028 | doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7473.1024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Atkins D., Siegel J., Slutsky J. | year = 2005 | title = Making policy when the evidence is in dispute | url = | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 102–113 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.102}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Following the guidelines of several well-respected national organizations, Merenstein had explained the pros and cons of [[prostate-specific antigen]] (PSA) testing to a patient, rather than simply ordering the test. He then documented the shared decision not to order the test. Later, the patient was diagnosed with incurable advanced [[prostate cancer]], and Merenstein and his residency were sued for not ordering the test. Although Merenstein was acquitted, his [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] was found liable for $1 million.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Merenstein D |date=7 January 2004 | title = A piece of my mind. Winners and losers | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 291 | issue = 1| pages = 15–16 |pmid=14709561 |doi=10.1001/jama.291.1.15 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ever since this ordeal, he regards his patients as potential plaintiffs: ‘I order more tests now, am more nervous around patients: I am no longer the doctor I should be’.
&lt;ref&gt;Lapp, T. (2005) Clinical guidelines in court: it’s a tug of war. American Academy of Family Physicians Report, 2005. Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.aafp.org/x33422.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410191120/http://www.aafp.org/x33422.xml |archivedate=2005-04-10 |df= }} (last accessed 12 February 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of [[Caesarean section]] have been found to increase by an average of 8% as seen after 2.5 years following a related medical error.&lt;ref name="Shurtz2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shurtz|first1=Ity|title=The impact of medical errors on physician behavior: Evidence from malpractice litigation|journal=Journal of Health Economics|volume=32|issue=2|year=2013|pages=331–340|issn=01676296|doi=10.1016/j.jhealeco.2012.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study with 824 US surgeons, obstetricians, and other specialists at high risk of litigation, 93% reported practicing defensive medicine, such as ordering unnecessary [[CT scans]], [[biopsies]], and [[MRIs]], and prescribing more [[antibiotics]] than medically indicated.&lt;ref name="Studdert"/&gt;
In Switzerland, where litigation is less common, 41% of general practitioners and 43% of internists, reported that they sometimes or often recommend PSA tests for legal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Steurer J. |author2=Held U. |author3=Schmidt M. |author4=Gigerenzer G. |author5=Tag B. |author6=Bachmann L. M. | year = 2009 | title = Legal concerns trigger PSA testing | url = | journal = Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 390–392 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2753.2008.01024.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of defensive medicine also expresses itself in discrepancies between what treatments doctors recommend to patients, and what they recommend to their own families. In Switzerland, for instance, the rate of [[hysterectomy]] in the general population is 16%, whereas among doctors’ wives and female doctors it is only 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Domenighetti G. |author2=Casabianca A. |author3=Gutzwiller F. |author4=Martinoli S. | year = 1993 | title = Revisiting the most informed consumer of surgical services: The physician-patient | url = | journal = International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 505–513 | doi=10.1017/s0266462300005420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==

=== Financial ===
Defensive medical decision making has spread to many areas of clinical medicine and is seen as a major factor in the increase in health care costs, estimated at tens of billions of dollars annually in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anderson R. E. | year = 1999 | title = Billions for defense: the pervasive nature of defensive medicine | url = | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 159 | issue = 20| pages = 2399–2402 | doi=10.1001/archinte.159.20.2399}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of a random sample of 1452 closed malpractice claims from five U.S. liability insurers showed that the average time between injury and resolution was 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Studdert D. M. |author2=Mello M.M. |author3=Gawande A. A. |author4=Gandhi T.K. |author5=Kachalia A. |author6=Yoon C. |author7=Puopolo A. L. |author8=Brennan T.A. | year = 2006 | title = Claims, errors, and compensation payments in medical malpractice litigation | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 354 | issue = | pages = 2024–33 | doi=10.1056/nejmsa054479}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indemnity costs were $376 million, and defense administration cost $73 million, resulting in total costs of $449 million. The system’s overhead costs were exorbitant: 35% of the indemnity payments went to the plaintiffs' attorneys, and together with defense costs, the total costs of litigation amounted to 54% of the compensation paid to plaintiffs.

=== Patient care ===
Theoretical arguments based on [[utilitarianism]] conclude that defensive medicine is, on average, harmful to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9456202 | volume=18 | title=Is the defensive use of diagnostic tests good for patients, or bad? |vauthors=DeKay ML, Asch DA | journal=Med Decis Making | pages=19–28 | doi=10.1177/0272989x9801800105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malpractice suits are often seen as a mechanism to improve the quality of care, but with custom-based liability, they actually impede the translation of evidence into practice, harming patients and decreasing the quality of care. [[Tort]] law in many countries and jurisdictions not only discourages but actively penalizes physicians who practice [[evidence-based medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Monahan J | year = 2007 | title = Statistical literacy. A prerequisite for evidence-based medicine | url = | journal = Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume = 8 | issue = | page = i-ii | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6053.2008.00033_1.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar phenomena outside healthcare ==
Defensive decision making do not only occur in health care but also in business and politics. For instance, managers of large international companies report making defensive decisions in one third to half of all cases, on average.&lt;ref&gt;Gigerenzer, G. (2014) Risk savvy: How to make good decisions. New York: Viking.&lt;/ref&gt; That means, these managers pursue options that are second best for their company but protect themselves in case something goes wrong.

{{Disability}}
A '''disability pension''' is a form of [[pension]] given to those people who are permanently or temporarily unable to [[employment|work]] due to a [[disability]]. It is distinct from [[welfare]].

== North America ==
An example of a disability pension is from a private or Public Pension Plan, or the [[Canada Pension Plan]]. Another example is [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] (SSDI) in the United States.

Generally, there is a minimum time of service required to be eligible for the disability retirement benefit. The claimants might be directed to sign a waiver for their medical records to be disclosed and commonly is scheduled for an independent medical evaluation (IME) to confirm they are permanently disabled. The pension is calculated based on years worked, so the disability retiree can retire earlier (since they are unable to work), but receives an equitable pension based on years of service.

== Australasia ==
=== Australia ===
Australian residents of working age who are unable to work for 15 hours a week for the next two years are eligible for the '''Disability Support Pension'''. Those intending to claim the DSP need to provide a report from their treating doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/payments/qual_how_dsp.htm |author=[[Centrelink]] |title=Who can get Disability Support Pension? |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2009-01-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730235334/http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/payments/qual_how_dsp.htm |archivedate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beneficiaries of the Disability Support Pension receive significantly more than those on [[unemployment benefit]]s; as of 1 January 2009 the basic rate is [[Australian dollar|A$]]562.10 per [[fortnight]] for singles and A$469.50 for each member of a couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/payments/pay_how_dsp.htm |author=[[Centrelink]] |title=How much Disability Support Pension do I get? |date=2008-12-16 |accessdate=2009-01-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822213430/http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/payments/pay_how_dsp.htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Disability Support Pension, previously known as the Invalid Pension, were first introduced in the state of [[New South Wales]] in 1908. The [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth government]] introduced a nationwide Invalid Pension on [[December 1910|December 5, 1910]].&lt;ref&gt;"Commonwealth Old-Age and Invalid Pensions Schemes", by T.H. Kewley, ''Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society'' (1953) p153&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/8e72c4526a94aaedca2569de00296978!OpenDocument |author=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |title=1301.0 - Year Book Australia, 1971: History of Pensions and Other Benefits in Australia |date=1971-01-01 |accessdate=2009-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517120206/http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs%40.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/8e72c4526a94aaedca2569de00296978%21OpenDocument |archivedate=2013-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australians who are temporarily unable to work due to illness, injury or a short-term disability may be eligible for '''Sickness Allowance'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/centrelink/sickness-allowance |author=[[Centrelink]] |title=Sickness Allowance |date=2007-02-09 |accessdate=2009-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sickness Allowance pays less than the DSP; as of 1 January 2009, single recipients were entitled to a basic rate of A$449.30 per fortnight and couples A$405.30 for each person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/payments/pay_how_sck.htm |author=[[Centrelink]] |title=How much Sickness Allowance do I get? |date=2008-12-16 |accessdate=2009-01-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726124219/http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/payments/pay_how_sck.htm |archivedate=2008-07-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all [[Social Security (Australia)|Australian social security]] payments, eligibility for the DSP and the Sickness Allowance is not dependent on individual contributions; rather, benefits are paid out of general Commonwealth government revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/progdesc/ssptw/2004-2005/asia/australia.html |author=[[Social Security Administration]] (United States) |title=Social Security Programs Throughout the World: Asia and the Pacific, 2004 |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]] income support exists for people with physical or mental health issues.  The two main disability benefits are the '''Sickness Benefit''', and the '''Invalid's Benefit'''. A doctor's referral and medical certificate (or equivalent) is needed to claim the benefits.  The Invalid's Benefit is for someone who has a severe disability, and/or long term sickness, which is paid slightly more than the Sickness Benefit.  In addition, there is the '''Disability Allowance''', to supplement medical costs.  If the Disability Allowance does not pay for all medical costs, then '''Temporary Additional Support''' is provided, but obtaining it is more difficult.  All of these benefits have maximum limits, depending on such things as income (both the individual and their partner) and cash assets.  Note that the Sickness Benefit and Invalid's Benefit are for people aged less than 65 but the Disability Allowance is for anyone over 18 years.

== Europe ==
=== United Kingdom ===
The [[United Kingdom]] equivalents are:

* '''[[Disability Living Allowance]]''' (DLA) which is a benefit for children who have walking difficulties or need personal care due to physical, mental or sensory disability. It was historically also available to people of working age (up to the age of 65)
* '''[[Personal Independence Payment]]''' (PIP) which is a new benefit for people of working age (between 18 and state pension age), who need help with personal care and/or mobility due to physical or mental disability. PIP will continue to be paid to claimants after they reach state pension age.
* '''[[Attendance Allowance]]''' (AA) which is a benefit for people over the state pension age (65), who need help with personal care due to physical or mental disability. Since PIP claims continue beyond pension age, AA will effectively be gradually superseded, taking a couple of decades to fade away.

In order to cover loss of income from illness and disability, there is also [[Statutory Sick Pay]], and its long term equivalent - [[Employment and Support Allowance]] (ESA). The new [[Universal Credit]] scheme will include an equivalent element for those with long-term unfitness to work; ESA will consequently be abolished by the roll out of Universal Credit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6362">The '''''Electronic Commerce Protection Act''''' (ECPA) (the ''Act'') is anti-[[Spam (electronic)|spam]] [[List of Acts of Parliament of Canada|legislation]] introduced in 2009 by the [[Government of Canada]] at the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2009/04/24/anti-spam-legislation.html CBC News: Conservatives introduce anti-spam bill]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Spam legislation in Canada was first introduced in 2004 when the ''Anti‐Spam Action Plan for Canada'' was launched. The Government of Canada assembled a group of industry representatives, scholars, and experts to examine the problems created by spam in Canada and how to potentially address them.  The first Canadian bill directly addressing spam was Senator Yoine Goldstein’s Bill S‐202. Bill S-202 was introduced in 2008 and sought to prohibit unsolicited commercial messages, requiring explicit consent from the recipient.  In 2009, the Minister of Industry, Tony Clement, introduced Bill C‐27 or the ''Electronic Commerce Protection Act'' (ECPA).  The ECPA died on the order paper in December 2009, after the bill cleared the House of Commons committee.  The ECPA was quickly re‐introduced as the ''Fighting Internet and Wireless Spam Act'', Bill C‐28 ("FISA") – a name that more closely reflected the original political message of the Conservative Party of Canada (May 25, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Lawford, John, Lo, Janet, &amp; De Santis, Michael.  (December 2010).  "PIAC Report: Can We CAN SPAM in Canada?".  Retrieved on March 7, 2014. - http://www.piac.ca/files/can_we_can_spam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, December 15, 2010, the Government of Canada passed the ''Fighting the Internet and Wireless Spam Bill''. The coming into force of the ECPA had been delayed for three and a half years because of very intense lobbying efforts by industry groups. The ''Electronic Commerce Protection Act'' (SPAM bill) selectively came into effect on July 1, 2014. Because of ongoing fierce lobbying other parts of the ''Act'' relating to the unsolicited installation of computer programs was delayed until January 15, 2015.

==Government information==

The government website offers insight and detailed information on both the implementation and the enforcement of spam legislation. According to the Canadian government, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/home-accueil.htm (CRTC)]&lt;/ref&gt; will be the enforcement agency and issue administrative monetary penalties for violations of the spam legislation. Additionally, the Competition Bureau is supposed to seek "administrative monetary penalties and criminal sanctions under the Competition Act." The Office of the Privacy Commissioner is given "new powers under an amended ''Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act''" ([[PIPEDA]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://fightspam.gc.ca/eic/site/030.nsf/eng/h_00039.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The purpose of the ''Act'' is "to promote the efficiency and adaptability of the Canadian economy by regulating commercial conduct that discourages the use of electronic means to carry out commercial activities because that conduct:&lt;br&gt;
* (a) impairs the availability, reliability, efficiency and optimal use of electronic means to carry out commercial activities;
* (b) imposes additional costs on businesses and consumers;
* (c) compromises privacy and the security of confidential information; and
* (d) undermines the confidence of Canadians in the use of electronic means of communication to carry out their commercial activities in Canada and abroad." &lt;ref&gt;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-1.6/page-2.html#h-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penalties===

The maximum penalty for a violation is "$1,000,000 in the case of an individual and $10,000,000 in  the case of any other person." &lt;ref&gt;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-1.6/page-8.html#h-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulations===

The following provisions &lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-1.6/page-11.html#h-18]&lt;/ref&gt; will come into force with the implementation of the anti-spam laws: Liable persons include but are not limited to employees acting in the scope of their employment. "An officer, director, agent or mandatory of a corporation that commits a violation is liable for the violation if they directed, authorized, assented to, acquiesced in or participated in the commission of the violation, whether or not the corporation is proceeded against."&lt;ref&gt;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-1.6/page-11.html#h-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbying==

Intense industrial lobbying efforts against this bill by a number of paid lobbyists from marketing survey companies, real estate agencies, or copyright stakeholders &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geist|first=Michael|title=ECPA Passes House of Commons|url=https://www.straight.com/article-273004/vancouver/electronic-commerce-protection-act-passes-house-commons-moves-senate|publisher=Straight.com|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  include changes to the bill to counter fears that bill C-28 might interfere with their ability to seek or attract new potential customers or affect the growth of businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nowak|first=Peter|title=Marketers want anti-spam bill altered|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/marketers-want-anti-spam-bill-altered-1.811901|publisher=CBC|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill was challenged by businesses that are built on strong relationships with clients, for example, real estate agents. While the Liberal Party agrees that the ECPA restricts businesses in a number of ways, they support the ECPA because it restricts spam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geist|first=Michael|title=ECPA Passes House of Commons|url=https://www.straight.com/article-273004/vancouver/electronic-commerce-protection-act-passes-house-commons-moves-senate|publisher=Straight.com|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Engineers Without Borders Ireland''' is an [[international development]] organisation for students and professionals from [[Ireland]] who share a common interest in [[sustainable development]] through engineering and [[appropriate technologies]].

The organisation was initially founded in 2007, and partook in a 2-week project in the [http://www.sonairte.ie/ Sonairte: The National Ecology Centre] in Co. Meath, Ireland. After a lull in activities, a small group of engineers began discussions on reviving EWB-Ireland in 2009. These discussions led to the formation of EWB-Ireland's first ever national committee in January 2010. The committee is a small group of committed engineers from numerous disciplines, located throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/history EWB-Ireland Website - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, EWB-Ireland has branches in [[University College Dublin]] and [[Queens University Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/branches EWB Ireland Website - Branches]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Executive Order 11905''' is a [[United States President]]ial [[Executive Order (United States)|Executive Order]] signed on February 18, 1976, by President [[Gerald R. Ford]] as an attempt to reform the [[United States Intelligence Community]], improve oversight on foreign intelligence activities, and ban political [[assassination]].&lt;ref name="eorea1"&gt;{{cite web|title=President Gerald R.

==Background==

The Executive Order was created and signed by Gerald Ford after the [[Church Committee]] and [[Pike Committee]] had divulged secrets about the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]] in the 1970s, particularly regarding the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[assassination]] operations. The committees had been investigating the CIA's activity and EO 11905 was signed in an attempt to ban assassination and reform the intelligence community.&lt;ref name="capeo"/&gt;  

==Intelligence innovations==

EO 11905 made four major changes to the intelligence community but would not bring overwhelming, effective reform. First, the EO created a new National Security Committee on Foreign Intelligence, to be chaired by the [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. Second, the EO replaced the [[Oversight of United States covert operations#40 Committee|40 Committee]], which was responsible for oversight of covert activities, with the [[Oversight of United States covert operations#Operations Advisory Group|Operations Advisory Group]]. The Operations Advisory Group would have similar responsibilities and be composed of senior [[White House]], [[CIA]], [[U.S. State Department|State Department]] and [[U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] representatives. Third, the EO created a part-time [[Intelligence Oversight Board]] which was initially chaired by the former ambassador [[Robert Daniel Murphy]].  The chair of the Intelligence Oversight Board was to report illegal activity to the [[U.S. Attorney General|Attorney General]] and improprieties to the [[U.S. President|President]].&lt;ref name="eorea1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eorea2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="capeo"/&gt;

Lastly, the EO offered the United States' first ban on [[assassination]] (political): "No employee of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, political assassination." This ban on assassination would be superseded and strengthened with [[Executive Order 12036]].&lt;ref name="eorea1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eorea2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="capeo"/&gt;

'''Executive Order 13769''', titled '''Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States''', often referred to as the '''Muslim ban'''&lt;ref name="Muslim ban"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41382585 US expands travel ban to include N Korea], [[BBC]] "Mr Trump's original ban was highly controversial, as it affected six majority-Muslim countries, and was widely labelled a 'Muslim ban'."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- DO NOT remove references to "muslim ban" without first discussing on talk page, thank you. --&gt; or the '''travel ban''', was an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] issued by [[United States]] President [[Donald Trump]]. Except for the extent to which it was blocked by various courts, it was in effect from 27 January 2017, until 16 March 2017, when it was superseded by [[Executive Order 13780]]. Executive Order 13769 lowered the number of refugees to be admitted into the United States in 2017 to 50,000, suspended the [[United States Refugee Admissions Program|U.S. Refugee Admissions Program]] (USRAP) for 120 days, suspended the entry of [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]] indefinitely, directed some [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet secretaries]] to suspend entry of those whose countries do not meet adjudication standards under [[Immigration and Nationality Act|U.S. immigration law]] for 90 days, and included exceptions on a case-by-case basis. [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] lists these countries as [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Executive Order 13769 of January 27, 2017: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States. Executive Office of the President. {{Federal Register|82|8977}}–8982. February 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 700 travelers were detained, and up to 60,000 [[Visa policy of the United States|visas]] were "provisionally revoked".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/03/513306413/state-department-says-fewer-than-60-000-visas-revoked-under-travel-order|date=February 3, 2017|title=Federal Judge Stays Trump Travel Order, But Many Visas Already Revoked|work=[[NPR]]|quote=The State Department said today "roughly 60,000 individuals' visas were provisionally revoked" as a result of Trump's Jan. 27 executive order barring refugees from seven countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The signing of the order provoked widespread [[Reactions to Executive Order 13769|condemnation and protests]] and resulted in [[legal challenges to the Trump travel ban|legal intervention against the enforcement of the order]] with some calling it a "Muslim ban" because Trump had previously called for temporarily banning Muslims from America soon after the [[2015 San Bernardino attack|2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack]], and because all of the affected countries had a Muslim majority.&lt;ref name="Muslim ban" /&gt; A nationwide [[temporary restraining order]] (TRO) was issued on 3 February 2017 in the case ''[[Washington v. Trump]]'', which was upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] on 9 February 2017. Consequently, the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) stopped enforcing portions of the order and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] re-validated visas that had been previously revoked. Later, other orders ([[Executive Order 13780]] and [[Presidential Proclamation 9645]]) were signed by Trump and superseded order 13769. On June 26, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the third executive order (Presidential Proclamation 9645) and its accompanying travel ban in a [[Trump v. Hawaii|5-4 decision]], with the majority opinion being written by Chief Justice John Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump’s Travel Ban Is Upheld by Supreme Court|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-travel-ban.html|publisher=nytimes.com|work=Adam Liptak and Michael D.

==Background==
===Statutory authorization and related prohibitions===

Key provisions of executive orders 13769 and 13780 cite to paragraph (f) of [[Title 8 of the United States Code]] § 1182, which discusses inadmissible aliens. Paragraph (f) states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.{{efn |{{USCSub |8 |1182 |f}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The act that underlies this, known as the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (a.k.a. the McCarran–Walter Act)]], was amended by the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (a.k.a. the Hart−Celler Act)]], which included a provision stating 

&lt;blockquote&gt;No person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.{{efn |{{USCSub |8 |1152 |a}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The language in the INA of 1965 is among the reasons District of Maryland [[Theodore D. Chuang|Judge Chuang]] issued a temporary restraining order blocking Section 2(c) of Executive Order 13780.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cato.org/blog/court-rules-president-violated-1965-law-executive-order|first=David|last=Bier|publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |date=March 17, 2017|title=Court Rules the President Violated the 1965 Law with Executive Order}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restrictions by Obama administration===
In 1986, the [[Visa Waiver Program]] was initiated by President Ronald Reagan, allowing alien nationals of select countries to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without a visa, in return for reciprocal treatment of U.S. nationals. By 2016, the program had been extended to 38 countries.&lt;ref name="CBPVWPinfo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/visa-waiver-program/visa-waiver-program-improvement-and-terrorist-travel-prevention-act-faq|website=U.S. Customs and Border Protection|publisher=United States Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Congress passed a [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016|Consolidated Appropriations Act]] to fund the government, and Obama signed the bill into law. The Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015, which was previously passed by the House of Representatives as H.R. 158, was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act as Division O, Title II, Section 203. The Trump administration's executive order relied on H.R. 158, as enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/158/text|title=H.R.158 – Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015|last=|first=|date=2015|publisher=Congress.gov|access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act originally affected four countries: Iraq, Syria, and countries on the [[State Sponsors of Terrorism]] list (Iran and Sudan). Foreigners who were nationals of those countries, or who had visited those countries since 2011, were required to obtain a visa to enter the United States, even if they were nationals or dual-nationals of the 38 countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Boyle | first=Danny | date=January 20, 2016 | title=BBC journalist stopped from boarding plane to America over Iranian dual-nationality - Telegraph | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/12109545/BBC-journalist-stopped-from-boarding-plane-to-America-over-Iranian-dual-nationality.html | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | access-date=March 22, 2017 | quote=But the new restrictions mean anybody who has travelled to Iran, Iraq, Syria and Sudan since 2011 will have to apply for a visa.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libya, Yemen, and Somalia were added later as "countries of concern" by [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Jeh Johnson]] during the Obama administration.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/30/donald-trump/why-comparing-trumps-and-obamas-immigration-restri/|title=Why comparing Trump's and Obama's immigration restrictions is flawed|last=Qiu|first=Linda|date=January 30, 2017|website=[[PolitiFact.com]]|publisher=Tampa Bay Times|access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.snopes.com/trump-immigration-order-obama/|title=Wherever Visa Is Accepted|last=LaCapria|first=Kim|date=January 30, 2017|publisher=[[Snopes.com]] |access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Blaine | first1 = Kyle | last2 = Horowitz | first2 = Julia | url = http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/how-the-trump-administration-chose-the-7-countries/index.html | title = How the Trump administration chose the 7 countries in the immigration executive order | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = January 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38798588|title=US travel ban: Why these seven countries?|date=January 30, 2017|publisher=[[BBC News]] |last1=Goodman|first1=Jack|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShelbourneMallory20170129"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shelbourne|first=Mallory|title=Spicer: Obama administration originally flagged 7 countries in Trump's order|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/316733-spicer-obama-administration-originally-flagged-7-countries |newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=January 29, 2017 |accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Department of Homeland Security|url=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/02/18/dhs-announces-further-travel-restrictions-visa-waiver-program|date=February 18, 2016 |title=DHS Announces Further Travel Restrictions for the Visa Waiver Program |access-date=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The executive order refers to these countries as "countries designated pursuant to Division O, Title II, Section 203 of the 2016 consolidated Appropriations Act".&lt;ref name="Qiu 2017"&gt;{{cite web|author-last=Qiu|author-first=Linda|editor-last=Sharockman|editor-first=Aaron|title=Why comparing Trump's and Obama's immigration restrictions is flawed|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/30/donald-trump/why-comparing-trumps-and-obamas-immigration-restri|website=[[PolitiFact.com]]|date=January 30, 2017 |accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, in 2011, additional background checks were imposed on the nationals of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arango |first1=Tim |authorlink=Tim Arango |title=Visa Delays Put Iraqis Who Aided U.S. in Fear|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/world/middleeast/13baghdad.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 12, 2011 |accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July, Pence, who as governor of Indiana attempted to suspend settlement of Syrian refugees to the state but was prevented from doing so by the courts, said that decision was based on the fall 2015 FBI assessment that there is risk associated with bringing in refugees. Pence cited the [[Bowling Green massacre#Terrorism-related arrests in Bowling Green|infiltration of Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green Kentucky who were arrested in 2011 for attempting to provide weapons to ISIS]] and Obama's suspension of the Iraqi refugee program in response as precedent for a U.S. President's "temporarily suspend[ing] immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/07/15/mike-pence-explains-why-is-running-with-donald-trump/|first=Mike|last=Pence |authorlink=Mike Pence |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=July 15, 2016|title=Mike Pence explains why he is running with Donald Trump|interviewer=Sean Hannity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/al-qaeda-kentucky-us-dozens-terrorists-country-refugees/story?id=20931131|publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=November 20, 2013|title=US May Have Let 'Dozens' of Terrorists Into Country As Refugees|first=James Gordon|last=Meek|first2=Cindy|last2=Galli|first3=Brian|last3=Ross |author3link=Brian Ross (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 5 suspends the [[United States Refugee Admissions Program|U.S. Refugee Admissions Program]] (USRAP) for at least 120 days but stipulates that the program can be resumed for citizens of the specified countries if the Secretary of State, Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence agree to do so.&lt;ref name="nyt-annotated"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The suspension for Syrian refugees is indefinite.&lt;ref name="nyt-annotated"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox_foreign_nat_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/27/u-s-backed-iraqi-fighters-say-trumps-refugee-ban-feels-like-betrayal.html|title=U.S.-backed Iraqi fighters say Trump's refugee ban feels like 'betrayal'|first=Hollie|last=McKay |authorlink=Hollie McKay |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=January 25, 2017|accessdate=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of new refugees allowed in 2017 is capped to 50,000 (reduced from 110,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/2-iraqis-file-lawsuit-after-being-detained-in-ny-due-to-travel-ban|title=Judges temporarily block part of Trump's immigration order, WH stands by it|publisher=[[CNN]] |date=January 29, 2017|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the resumption of USRAP refugee applications will be prioritized based on religion-based persecutions only in the case that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/514820|title=Where Christian Leaders Stand on Trump's Refugee Policy|last=Green|first=Emma|date=January 27, 2017|publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-trump-christians-muslims-20170128-story,amp.html|title=Trump's refugee policy raises a question: How do you tell a Christian from a Muslim?|last=Bulos|first=Nabi|date=January 29, 2017|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration-visas-refugees-syria-iraq-terrorism-isis-attacks-most-victims-a7550936.html|title=Donald Trump immigration ban: Most Isis victims are Muslims despite President's planned exemption for Christians|date=January 28, 2017|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|last1=Dearden|first1=Lizzie|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly, has stated to Congress that DHS is considering a requirement that refugees and visa applicants reveal social media passwords as part of security screening. The idea was one of many to strengthen border security, as well as requesting financial records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/02/us-visitors-may-have-to-reveal-social-media-passwords-to-enter-country|title=US visitors may have to reveal social media passwords to enter country|newspaper=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the Obama administration released a memo revealing a similar plan to vet social media accounts for visa applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/homeland-security-rejected-plan-vet-visa-applicants-social-media-n481681|title=Homeland Security Failed to Adopt Plan to Vet Visa Applicants' Social Media|publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=December 17, 2015 |accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Kelly has stated that the temporary ban is important and that the DHS is developing what "extreme vetting" might look like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=January 31, 2017 |url=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2017/01/31/john-kelly-extreme-vetting|title=Homeland Security Secretary: We Are Developing What Extreme Vetting Might Look Like |publisher=[[KYW-TV|CBS Philly]] |accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green-card holders===
There was some early confusion about the status of green-card holders (i.e., lawful [[permanent residence (United States)|permanent residents]]). According to the lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota, dated February 3, the government had changed its position five times to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/04/17-35105%20motion.pdf|title=C17-00141-JLR-- State of Washington and State of Minnesota v. Donald Trump|publisher=United States Courts for the Ninth Circuit|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, on the evening of Friday January 27, the Department of Homeland Security sent out a guidance to airlines stated "lawful permanent residents are not included and may continue to travel to the USA". CNN reported that it was overruled by the White House overnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban/index.html|title=Inside the confusion of the Trump executive order and travel ban|author=Evan Perez |author2=[[Pamela Brown (journalist)|Pamela Brown]] |author3=Kevin Liptak |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Saturday, January 28, the Department of Homeland Security's Acting Press Secretary Gillian Christensen said in an e-mail to Reuters that the order barred green-card holders from the affected countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/316670-trump-refugee-ban-bars-green-card-holders-report|title=Immigration ban includes green card holders: DHS|last=Greenwood|first=Max|date=2017-01-28|newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Saturday afternoon White House officials said they would need a case-by-case waiver to return.&lt;ref name="nyt_impact"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html|title=Judge Blocks Part of Trump's Immigration Order|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=January 28, 2017 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |last2=Feuer|first2=Alan |accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Sunday White House Chief of Staff [[Reince Priebus]] said that green-card holders would not be prevented from returning to the United States.&lt;ref name=nyt_greencard/&gt;

According to the [[Associated Press]] no green-card holders were ultimately denied entry to the U.S. although several initially spent "long hours" in detention.&lt;ref name="nyt_greencard"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/politics/white-house-official-in-reversal-says-green-card-holders-wont-be-barred.html|title=White House Official, in Reversal, Says Green Card Holders Won't Be Barred|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|last=Shear|first=Michael|date=January 29, 2017|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/29/tears-and-detention-for-us-visitors-as-trump-travel-ban-hits.html|title=Tears and detention for US visitors as Trump travel ban hits|date=January 29, 2017 |publisher=[[Fox News]]l |accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29 the Secretary of Homeland Security [[John F.

=== Dual citizens ===
There was similar confusion about whether the order affected dual citizens of a banned country and a non-banned country. The State Department said that the order did not affect U.S. citizens who also hold citizenship of one of the seven banned countries. On January 28 the State Department stated that other travelers with dual nationality of one of these countries—for example, an Iranian who also holds a Canadian passport—would not be permitted to enter. However, the [[International Air Transport Association]] told their airlines that dual nationals who hold a passport from a non-banned country would be allowed in.&lt;ref name="cnn_dual"&gt;{{cite news|last=Merica|first=Dan|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-green-card-dual-citizens|title=How Trump's travel ban affects green card holders and dual citizens|publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] issued a press release that the restrictions apply to those traveling from the listed countries not those that merely have their citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/presidential-executive-order-on-inbound-migration-to-us|title=Presidential executive order on inbound migration to US|date=January 29, 2017|publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129211109/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/presidential-executive-order-on-inbound-migration-to-us|archivedate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confusion led companies and institutions to take a more cautious approach; for example, [[Google]] told its dual-national employees to stay in the United States until more clarity could be provided.&lt;ref name=cnn_dual/&gt; On January 31 the State Department updated the restrictions to allow persons holding dual citizenship to enter the US provided they possessed a US visa and entered using a passport from an unrestricted country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/officials-clarify-impact-dual-nationals-trumps-immigration-executive/story?id=45178731| title=Officials Aim to Clarify Impact on Dual Nationals From Trump's Immigration Executive Order|publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=February 1, 1017|accessdate=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===All entrants who are subject to adjudication===
Section 4 orders development of a uniform screening procedure as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits; components of the screening procedure are suggested but not determined.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Section 1 ("Purpose") requires screening to identify those who would "place violent ideologies higher than American law" or "oppress Americans of any ... gender or sexual orientation".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; The only suggested component of the uniform screening procedure in section 4 that specifically mentions a potential entrant's mindset is "a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Trump's August 15 speech proposed an ideological test for all immigrants to screen out people who might harbor violent or oppressive attitudes toward women or gays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/14/politics/donald-trump-isis-fight/|date=August 15, 2016|title=Trump proposes values test for would-be immigrants in fiery ISIS speech|publisher=[[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, immigration expert [[Stephen Yale-Loehr]] suggested that an ideological test could involve screening immigration applicants' social media pages as part of a routine background check.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/trump-immigration-plan-us-constitution|title=Trump's 'deeply un-American' stance on immigration prompts legal concerns|first=Lauren|last=Gambino|date=August 17, 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trump administration has formally proposed adding optional collection of social media account information for visa applicants from China affecting approximately 3.6 million people annually.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register Notice and Request for Comments of February 21, 2017: Agency Information Collection Activities: Electronic Visa Update System.

===Deleted provision regarding safe zones in Syria===
{{Further|Safe zone (Syria)}}
A leaked prior draft of the order (published by ''The Washington Post'' before the order went into effect) would have ordered that "the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense, is directed within 90 days of the date of this order to produce a plan to provide safe areas in Syria and in the surrounding region in which Syrian nationals displaced from their homeland can await firm settlement, such as repatriation or potential third-country resettlement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Draft executive order would begin 'extreme vetting' of immigrants and visitors to the U.S.|date=January 25, 2017|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/draft-executive-order-would-begin-extreme-vetting-of-immigrants-and-visitors-to-the-us/2017/01/25/17a27424-e328-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Read the draft of the executive order on immigration and refugees|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/read-the-draft-of-the-executive-order-on-immigration-and-refugees/2289|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provision was omitted from the final order.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Rex Tillerson]], Trump's Secretary of State, had not yet taken office at the time the executive order went into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/30/chuck-schumer-wants-delay-rex-tillerson-vote-possi|date=February 1, 2017|title=Chuck Schumer wants delay on Rex Tillerson vote, possibly other nominees, after executive order|first=Sherfinski|last=David|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after his campaign Trump proposed establishing safe zones in Syria as an alternative to Syrian refugees' immigration to the U.S. In the past "safe zones" have been interpreted as establishing, among other things, no-fly zones over Syria. During the Obama administration [[Turkey]] encouraged the U.S. to establish safe zones; the Obama administration was concerned about the potential for pulling the U.S. into a war with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-syria-safezones-idUSKBN1592O8|title=Trump says he will order 'safe zones' for Syria|date=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first weeks of Trump's presidency Turkey renewed its call for safe zones and proposed a new plan for them, the Trump administration has spoken with several other Sunni Arab States regarding safe zones, and Russia has asked for clarification regarding any Trump administration plan regarding safe zones. The UN High Commissioner on Refugees and [[Bashar Assad]] have dismissed safe zones as unworkable.

==Impact==
===Terrorism===
Trump's stated reason for issuing the executive order was to prevent terrorism.&lt;ref name="SalamaCaldwell"&gt;Vivian Salama &amp; Alicia A. Caldwell, [http://bigstory.ap.org/article/39f1f8e4ceed4a30a4570f693291c866/dhs-intel-report-disputes-threat-posed-travel-ban-nations AP Exclusive: DHS report disputes threat from banned nations], Associated Press (February 24, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; An internal report compiled by the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] Intelligence and Analysis Unit, however, concluded that people from the seven nations affected by the travel ban pose no increased terror risk.&lt;ref name="Nixon"&gt;Ron Nixon, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/25/us/politics/travel-ban-nations-terror-risk.html People From 7 Travel-Ban Nations Pose No Increased Terror Risk, Report Says], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (February 25, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that "country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity" and that few individuals from the seven affected countries access the U.S. in any case, since the State Department grants a small number of visas to citizens of those countries."&lt;ref name="SalamaCaldwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nixon"/&gt; The report found that of 82 people determined to have inspired by a [[foreign terrorist organization]] "to carry out or try to carry out an attack in the United States, just over half were U.S. citizens born in the United States," while the rest came from a group of 26 countries, only two of which were among the seven nations included in the ban.&lt;ref name="SalamaCaldwell"/&gt; White House and DHS officials downplayed the significance of the report, saying it was only a draft.&lt;ref name="Nixon"/&gt;

''The New York Times'' reported that "for an action aimed at terrorism, the order appeared to garner little or no support among experts and former officials of every political stripe with experience in the field."&lt;ref name="Shane"&gt;[[Scott Shane]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/politics/a-sweeping-order-unlikely-to-reduce-terrorist-threat.html "Immigration Ban Is Unlikely to Reduce Terrorist Threat, Experts Say"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (January 28, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Experts on terrorism, such as [[Charles Kurzman]] of the [[University of North Carolina]], [[Brian Michael Jenkins]] of the [[RAND Corporation]], and [[Daniel Benjamin]] of [[Dartmouth College]], formerly the State Department's top counterterrorism official. Benjamin said that the order was unlikely to reduce the terrorist threat, and "many experts believe the order's unintended consequences will make the threat worse."&lt;ref name="Shane"/&gt; Kurzman noted that since the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, no one has been killed in the U.S. in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from the seven affected countries.&lt;ref name="Shane"/&gt; Jenkins explained that of the 147 Jihadist plots and attacks since 9/11, 105 were perpetrated by U.S. citizens and 20 involved legal permanent residents. "In other words, 85 percent of the terrorists lived in the U.S. a long time before carrying out an attack—they were radicalized within the nation's borders."&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=Brian Michael |authorlink=Brian Michael Jenkins |title=Why a Travel Restriction Won't Stop Terrorism at Home|url=http://www.rand.org/blog/2017/02/why-a-travel-restriction-wont-stop-terrorism-at-home.html|website=The RAND Blog|publisher=[[RAND Corporation]] |accessdate=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins went on to say: "Had this temporary prohibition been in effect since 9/11, how many lives would have been saved Not one."&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; While Jenkins conceded that there were two individuals whose entry would have been prevented had the ban been in place since 9/11, both were in the country for years prior to engaging in terrorist related activities. According to Jenkins, the "... failure to identify these individuals before they entered the United States is not a flaw in the vetting process; it is our inability to predict human behavior years into the future."&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'' reporter [[Scott Shane]], the seven countries in the executive order had a "random quality"; the list excluded [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Egypt]] (where many jihadist groups were founded) and [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] (where extremism has a long history, and which have "produced militants who have occasionally reached the United States").&lt;ref name="Shane"/&gt; Benjamin stated that the order might be counterproductive in terms of counterterrorism cooperation and feeding into "the jihadist narrative" of a West at war with Islam.&lt;ref name="Shane"/&gt; [[Jonathan Schanzer]] of the conservative [[Foundation for the Defense of Democracies]] said that "The order appears to be based mainly on a campaign promise," and did not appear to be tied to any effort to improve vetting or other procedures.&lt;ref name="Shane"/&gt;

===Implementation at airports===
Shortly after the enactment of the executive order, at 4:42&amp;nbsp;pm on January 27, border officials across the country began enforcing the new rules. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported people with various backgrounds and statuses being denied entry or sent back; this included refugees and minority Christians from the affected countries as well as students and green-card holders returning to the United States after visits abroad.&lt;ref name=nyt_impact/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jorgensen |first1=Sarah |title=Syrian Christian family, visas in hand, turned back at airport |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/us/syrian-family-trump-travel-ban/ |accessdate=January 29, 2017 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3 attorneys for the DOJ's [[Office of Immigration Litigation]] advised a judge hearing one of the legal challenges to the order that more than 100,000 visas have been revoked as a consequence of the order.

The effect of the order was far broader, however, than the number of people detained. In terms of barred visa-holders, the federal government reported that more than "100,000 visas for foreigners inside and outside the United States have also been revoked, at least temporarily."&lt;ref name="SinghviParlapiano"&gt;{{cite news|authors=Anjali Singhvi &amp; Alicia Parlapiano|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/31/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-groups.html|date=January 31, 2017 |title=Trump's Immigration Ban: Who Is Barred and Who Is Not|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' fact-checker, citing State Department figures, reported that 60,000 U.S. visas were issued in the seven affected countries in fiscal year 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/30/the-number-of-people-affected-by-trumps-travel-ban-about-90000/|title=Fact check: White House claims 109 affected by travel ban - it's more like 90,000|first=Glenn|last=Kessler |authorlink=Glenn Kessler (journalist) |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] Fact Checker blog |date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that 86,000 nonimmigrant, temporary visas (mostly for tourism, business travel, temporary work, or education) has been granted to citizens in the seven affected countries in the 2015 fiscal year.&lt;ref name="SinghviParlapiano"/&gt; The executive order also barred people from the seven countries from obtaining new immigrant visas. In 2015, 52,365 people from the seven affected countries had been issued green cards (which are typically awarded soon after the arrival of an immigrant visa-holder to the United States); "[i]n general, about half of recent new legal permanent residents are new arrivals to the country, and the other half had their status adjusted after living in the United States."&lt;ref name="SinghviParlapiano"/&gt;

In the weeks of 2017 prior to the executive order, the U.S. admitted approximately 1,800 refugees per week (total) from the seven countries covered by the order. While the executive order was in effect, the U.S. received two refugees from those countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/26/us/trump-refugees-muslim.html|title=Muslim Refugees Were Admitted at a Lower Rate During Trump’s Refugee Ban|date=February 26, 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Audrey|last=Carlsen|first2=K.K.

===Impact on U.S. industry===
Google called its traveling employees back to the U.S. in case the order prevented them from returning. About 100 of the company's employees were thought to be affected by the order. Google CEO [[Sundar Pichai]] wrote in a letter to his staff that "it's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues. We've always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump executive order prompts Google to recall staff|publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=January 28, 2017|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38781420|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google recalling staff from abroad following Trump's immigration ban |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=January 28, 2017|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-muslim-ban-google-recalls-staff-immigration-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-tech-silicon-a7550876.html |last=Worley |first=Will |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amazon.com Inc.]], citing disruption in travel for its employees, and [[Expedia, Inc.|Expedia Inc.]], citing impact to its customers and refund costs, filed declarations in support of the states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Minnesota (state)|Minnesota]] in their case against the executive order, ''[[Washington v.

One effect of Trump's election and policies, and in particular, Trump's executive order, is the "Trump Slump" on the U.S. tourism industry, which contributed $1.47 trillion to the country's GDP in 2014. As reported by [[Frommer's]], according to Global Business Travel Association, as well as local tourist offices, with policies such as Executive Order 13769 making foreigners feeling less welcome, fewer tourists began traveling to the U.S., with all foreign tourism down 6.8%, online searches for flights from foreign countries down 17%, and foreign business travel dropping by $185 million during the first week of the immigration suspension.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Frommer|Frommer, Arthur]] (February 2017).

===Travelers and patients===
According to [[Trita Parsi]], the president of the [[National Iranian American Council]], the order distressed citizens of the affected countries including those holding valid green cards and valid visas. Those outside the U.S. fear that they will not be allowed in, while those already in the country fear that they will not be able to leave, even temporarily, because they would not be able to return.&lt;ref name="nyt_iran_reaction"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/world/middleeast/trump-visa-muslim-ban.html|title=In Iran, Shock and Bewilderment Over Trump Visa Crackdown|first1=Thomas|last1=Erdbrink|first2=Jeffrey|last2=Gettleman |author2link=Jeffrey Gettleman |date=January 27, 2017 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources have stated that the executive order, if upheld, is likely to contribute to a doctor shortage in the United States, disproportionately affecting rural areas and underprovided specialties.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/health/trump-travel-ban-doctors.html|title=Trump's Travel Ban, Aimed at Terrorists, Has Blocked Doctors|last=McNeil Jr|first=Donald G. |authorlink=Donald McNeil Jr. |date=2017-02-06|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an analysis by a [[Harvard Medical School]] group of professors, research analysts and physicians, the executive order is likely to reduce the number of physicians in the United States as approximately 5% of the foreign-trained physicians in the United States were trained in the seven countries targeted by the executive order. These doctors are disproportionately likely to practice medicine in rural, underserved regions and specialties facing a large shortage of practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-immigration-order-could-make-it-harder-to-find-a-psychiatrist-or-pediatrician|title=Trump's Immigration Order Could Make It Harder To Find A Psychiatrist Or Pediatrician|last=Jena|first=Anupam B. |author2=Andrew Olenski |author3=Daniel M.

Members of the United States Congress, including U.S. Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] (D-MA) and U.S. Representative [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] (D-GA) joined protests in their own home states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/28/warren-lewis-other-congressional-members-attend-trump-immigration-ban-protests/97207200|title=Warren, Lewis, headline Congressional members at Trump immigration ban protests|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google co-founder [[Sergey Brin]] (who emigrated to the United States with his family from the Soviet Union at the age of five)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-more-migrants-please-especially-the-clever-ones-2368622.html "Dominic Lawson: More migrants please, especially the clever ones"], ''[[The Independent]]'', October 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] president [[Sam Altman]] joined the protest at San Francisco airport.

== Social media presence  ==

Following Trump's announcement of the order, the topic began to trend on social media. Hashtags such as #MuslimBan, #TravelBan and #BanTrumpFromUK emerged. Shortly after, protests arose urging for the cancellation of Trump's UK visit, garnering up to 1.5 million signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/30/internet-reacted-donald-trumps-controversial-travel-ban/|title=How the internet reacted to Donald Trump's controversial travel ban|last=Molloy|first=Mark|date=2017|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, Trump tweeted "Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage..."&lt;ref name="News"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/timeline-president-trumps-immigration-executive-order-legal-challenges/story?id=45332741|title=A timeline of Trump's immigration executive order|last=News|first=A.

Celebrities, including [[Seth Rogen]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]] and many others expressed their opinions on the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/celebrities-donald-trump-immigration-ban-2017-1/#sarah-paulson-7|title=Celebrities are 'horrified' by Trump's 'un-American' immigration ban|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== #MuslimBan ===
On June 13, Trump proposed to suspend [[immigration]] from "areas of the world" with a history of terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states|title=EXECUTIVE ORDER: PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES|date=2017-01-27|work=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a change from his previous proposal to suspend Muslim immigration to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/news/politics/trumps-travel-ban-reportedly-replaced-even-restrictions/2078333|title=New Travel Restrictions Replacing Trump’s Travel Ban Are Even More Strict, According To Report|last=Golden|first=Hannah|work=Elite Daily|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hashtag became popular on Twitter and opposition to the Executive Order widely spread among all social media platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://memeburn.com/2017/03/trump-revised-travel-ban/|title=Trump revises travel ban, social media remains divided - Memeburn|date=2017-03-07|work=Memeburn|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== #GrandParentsNotTerrorists ===
Under the new policy, citizens from Libya, Syria, Iran, Somalia, Yemen and Sudan would be banned from entering the U.S. if they couldn't prove that they have a "bona fide relationship" with families in America, which excludes grandparents, aunts, uncles or any other "distant relatives." &lt;ref name="Blumberg"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/travel-ban-grandparents_us_59556d8ae4b05c37bb7d1790|title=Twitter Protests Trump's Travel Ban With #GrandparentsNotTerrorists|last=Blumberg|first=Antonia|date=2017-06-29|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; To express the opposition to the order, the hashtag #GrandParentsNotTerrorists was launched by the [[National Iranian American Council]] (NIAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/travel-ban-grandparents_us_59556d8ae4b05c37bb7d1790|title=Twitter Protests Trump's Travel Ban With #GrandparentsNotTerrorists|last=Blumberg|first=Antonia|date=2017-06-29|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hashtag allowed residents of the six countries to use Twitter and post photos of their grandparents to protest the policy.&lt;ref name="Blumberg"/&gt;

==Legal challenges==

Legal challenges to the order were brought almost immediately after its issuance. From January 28 to January 31 almost 50 cases were filed in federal courts. The courts, in turn, granted temporary relief, including a nationwide [[temporary restraining order]] (TRO) that bars the enforcement of major parts of the executive order. The TRO specifically blocks the executive branch from enforcing provisions of the executive order that (1) suspend entry into the U.S. for people from seven countries for 90 days and (2) place limitations on the acceptance of refugees, including "any action that prioritizes the refugee claims of certain religious minorities."&lt;ref name="LiptakStands"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Where Trump’s Travel Ban Stands|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/us/politics/trumps-travel-ban.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=6 February 2017|page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TRO also allows "people from the seven countries who had been authorized to travel, along with vetted refugees from all nations, to enter the country." The Trump administration appealed the TRO.&lt;ref name="LiptakStands"/&gt; According to the DHS Inspector General, [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers then violated the court orders by continuing to prevent some foreign passengers from boarding flights bound for the United States.&lt;ref name=NYT20january18/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGreport/&gt;  DHS officials contest the DHS Inspector General's finding that the court orders were violated.&lt;ref name=NYT20january18/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGreport/&gt;

The plaintiffs challenging the order argue that it contravenes the [[United States Constitution]], federal [[statute]]s, or both. The parties challenging the executive order include both private individuals (some of whom were blocked from entering the U.S. or detained following the executive order's issuance) and the states of Washington and Minnesota, represented by their [[state attorneys general]]. Other organizations such as the ACLU also challenged the order in court. Additionally, fifteen Democratic state attorneys general released a joint statement calling the executive order "unconstitutional, un-American and unlawful", and that "[w]e'll work together to fight it".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Isaac Dovere, [http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-immigration-attorneys-general-234338 Democratic state attorneys general vow action against refugee order], ''[[Politico]]'' (January 29, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Official Twitter account of New York State Attorney General Eric T.

In response to the lawsuits the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement on January 29 that it would continue to enforce the executive order and that "prohibited travel will remain prohibited". On the same day a White House spokesperson said that the rulings did not undercut the executive order. On January 30 Acting Attorney General [[Sally Yates]], an Obama administration holdover pending the confirmation of Trump's nominee barred the Justice Department from defending the executive order in court; She said she felt the order's effects were not in keeping "with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right".&lt;ref name="wsj 1/30"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/acting-attorney-general-orders-justice-dept-not-to-defend-trumps-travel-ban-1485819447|title=Acting Attorney General Orders Justice Dept.

Judge Alex Kozinski of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed a late dissent on March 17, 2017 to the 9th Cir. opinion in ''Washington v. Trump'' arguing against the State of Washington's Establishment Clause claims on grounds that Trump's speech during the campaign was political protected by the [[First Amendment]]. (Even though the 9th Circuit had declined to address that issue in reaching its ruling on ''Washington v. Trump'' and U.S. courts do not typically rule on issues that are not before them, Kozinski argued it was ok for him to address the issue because the District Judge in Hawaii had cited the 9th Cir. opinion in reaching its Establishment Clause ruling.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/03/the_9th_circuit_s_alex_kozinski_defends_trump_s_travel_ban_on_first_amendment.html|first=Richard|last=Hasen|title=Does the First Amendment Protect Trump’s Travel Ban?|date=March 20, 2017|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/03/17/17-35105_Amd_Order.pdf|date=March 17, 2017|title= No. 2:17-cv-00141 Amended Order}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 13 Judge [[Leonie Brinkema]] of the Eastern District of Virginia ordered a [[preliminary injunction]] against the federal defendants in ''Aziz v.

On March 15, 2017, United States District Judge [[Derrick Watson]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Hawaii]] issued a [[temporary restraining order]] preventing executive order 13780 from going into effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Levine, Dan |author2=Rosenberg, Mica |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-court-idUSKBN16M17N|title=U.S. judge in Hawaii puts emergency halt on Trump's new travel ban|date=March 15, 2017|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nuckols, Ben |author2=Johnson, Gene|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/03/15/ban/925aot1WCkjHXToUd3sTJK/story.html|title=Trump travel ban put on hold again|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the State of [[Hawaii]] showed a strong likelihood of success on their [[Establishment Clause]] claim in asserting that Executive Order 13780 was in fact a "Muslim ban". Judge Watson stated in his ruling, "When considered alongside the constitutional injuries and harms discussed above, and the questionable evidence supporting the Government's national security motivations, the balance of equities and public interests justify granting the Plaintiffs.

'''Family reunification''' is a recognized reason for [[immigration]] in many countries because of the presence of one or more family members in a certain country, therefore, enables the rest of the [[divided family]] or only specific members of the family to immigrate to that country as well.

Family reunification laws try to balance the right of a family to live together with the country's right to control immigration. However, what this balance looks like, e.g. which members of the family can be reunited, differs largely between countries.

A sub-case of family reunification is marriage migration, where one spouse immigrates to the country of the other spouse. Marriage migration can take place before marriage, in which case it falls under its own special category, or it can take place after marriage, in which case it falls under family reunification laws. Some countries allow family reunification for unmarried partners, provided they can prove an ongoing intimate relationship that also lasted longer than a certain period of time.

In recent years, there have been several cases of [[Minor (law)|minor]]s sent out on hazardous journeys in order to apply for [[political asylum]] status which, once granted, would enable the rest of the family to join them. However, in some countries only over 18 years old can apply for family reunification and it is only possible to be reunited with child dependants under 16 or partners, and not for parents or siblings.

==Legal framework==
===Europe===

A major part of immigrants to [[Europe]] do so through family reunification laws. Many countries in Europe have passed laws in recent years to limit people's ability to do so.

* [[Denmark]] – In the case of marriage, Danish law requires both spouses to be at least 23 1/2 years old. This is known as the [[24 year rule]]. Additionally, the couple's connection to Denmark must be stronger than to the country of origin (meaning in practice that the spouse in Denmark must have resided there for 12 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Danish spouse's attachment to Denmark|url=https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to_dk/familyreunification/spouses/attachment-requirement/den-herboende-aegtefaelle.htm|website=newtodenmark.dk|publisher=Danish Immigration Service|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), unless one spouse has lived in Denmark for more than 26 years or been a Danish citizens over 26 years (this exemption was recently suspended by a court ruling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Change in the attachment requirement in family reunification cases|url=https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/News/News/danish_immigration_service/2016/change_in_the_attachment_requirement.htm|website=newtodenmark.dk|publisher=Danish Immigration Service|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The non-Danish spouse is required to pass the Danish A1 language exam within 6 months of receiving their residence visa. A collateral of 52.490,12 DKK is submitted by the Danish-spouse to support the non-Danish spouse during their residence, up to 60% of this collateral is returned on successful completion of subsequent Danish language tests (A1 and A2).
* The [[Netherlands]] – In case of marriage, Dutch law requires the Dutch spouse to be at least 21 years old, and to earn a salary of at least 120% the minimum wage. The non-Dutch spouse is required to pass integration exams at the Dutch embassy in their home country, showing a basic mastery of Dutch. Where a law case would take years and thousands of euros, the EU-rules of free movement give right to family life immediately without costs more than that of an identity card. Therefore, some Dutch people move to Belgium or Germany for at least six months, in order to be governed by the EU family unification rules instead of the Dutch family unification rules. This has become known as the "[[Belgian Route]]" or "[[EU Route]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkskrant.nl/buitenland/article152295.ece/Belgie_vindt_Nederlands_vreemdelingenbeleid_te_streng België vindt Nederlands vreemdelingenbeleid te streng] ; {{cite web |url=http://ejw.sagepub.com/content/20/1/61.abstract |first1=Saskia |last1=Bonjour |first2=Betty |last2=de Hart |year=2013 |title=A proper wife, a proper marriage. Constructions of us and them in Dutch family migration policy |publisher=European Journal of Women's Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Germany]] – Since 2007, law requires each spouse to be at least 18 years old. The spouse living in Germany may not be dependent on social benefits and must possess adequate living space. The immigrating spouse needs to prove basic spoken and written knowledge of German language. The law applies to German and foreign citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15718166-12342031] Block &amp; Bonjour 2013 'Fortress Europe or Europe of Rights. The Europeanisation of Family migration policies in France, Germany and the Netherlands' in European Journal of Migration and Law&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Norway]] – The sponsor must have an income of at least NOK&amp;nbsp;251,856 (US$37,000) pre-tax during 2014 and have earned at least NOK&amp;nbsp;246,136 in 2013 pre-tax. The reference person cannot have received social security benefits during the last 12 months. The income requirement must be proven to the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration every year.
* [[UK]] – The Immigration Rules, under the [[Immigration Act 1971]], were updated in 2012 to create a strict minimum income threshold for non-EU spouses and children to be given [[Indefinite leave to remain|leave to remain in the UK]]. Since 2012, the applicant must meet the financial requirement of £18,600 per year if they’re applying only for themselves, £22,400 per year for themselves and one child, and £2,400 per year for each additional child. These rules were challenged in the courts, and in 2017 the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] found that while "the minimum income threshold is accepted in principle" they decided that the rules and guidance were defective and unlawful until amended to give more weight to the interests of the children involved, and that sources of funding other than the British spouse's income should be considered.&lt;ref name=guardian-20170222&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/feb/22/supreme-court-backs-minimum-income-rule-for-non-european-spouses |title=Supreme court backs minimum income rule for non-European spouses |first=Alan |last=Travis |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 February 2017 |accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cco-201508&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.jcwi.org.uk/sites/jcwi/files/CCO-Family-Friendly-Report-090915.pdf |title=The impact on children of the Family Migration Rules |publisher=Children's Commissioner for England |date=August 2015 |accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Settlement visa approval rate for 2017 was 76%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.swiftimmigration.co.uk/uk-spouse-and-settlement-visa/|title=UK Spouse and Settlement Visa – Swift Immigration|website=www.swiftimmigration.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===

====Canada====

Under the [[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]] and associated Regulations, a [[Canadian citizen]] or permanent resident of Canada aged at least 18 is allowed, subject to certain conditions, to sponsor specific members of their immediate family for permanent residence in Canada.
 
The eligible persons are the sponsor's spouse, common-law partner, or conjugal partner aged 16 and over, parents and grandparents, a dependent child of the sponsor, a child whom the sponsor intends to adopt, and orphaned brothers, sisters, nieces, or grandchildren under the age of 18 and who are not married or living in a common-law relationship. As an exception to the rules, if there are no eligible persons from the preceding list who may be sponsored and the sponsor has no relatives in Canada, the ''''last-remaining family member'''' may be sponsored, but applications of this type are rare.

Some families spend many years apart before reuniting, even going as far as children having little to no memories of being all together in their home country. Once a family has been reunited in Canada, they must go through the process of getting to know one another again &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This process is not always easy, as at times children describe the parents who moved to Canada first as strangers. Living together once again and settling into a new culture, language, jobs, and schools can be stressful for families and leave a lot for them to work through &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====United States====
{{Expert needed|law|date=November 2008}}
{{See also|Immigration to the United States|History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States}}
Family reunification is the most common legal basis for immigration to the United States, and it is governed by the terms of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]], as amended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/propub/ProPubVAP.jsp?dockey=cb90c19a50729fb47fb0686648558dbe Immigration and Nationality Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821091032/http://www.uscis.gov/propub/ProPubVAP.jsp?dockey=cb90c19a50729fb47fb0686648558dbe |date=21 August 2008 }}, as retrieved from the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the emphasis on family reunification in American immigration law began in that 1965 act by allotting 74% of all new immigrants allowed into the United States to family reunification visas. Those included, in descending preference, unmarried adult children of U.S. citizens (20%), spouses and unmarried children of permanent resident aliens (20%), married children of U.S. citizens (10%), and brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens over age 21 (24%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel J. |last=Tichenor |title=Dividing Lines: The Politics of Immigration Control in America |publisher=Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press |year=2002 |page= 216}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2016, advocates of more restrictive immigration laws have often criticized family reunification as [[Chain migration]], however, scholars typically use that term for the broader process by which people from particular towns or regions follow each other to new cities and occupations.

Citizens and permanent residents of the United States may sponsor relatives for immigration to the United States in a variety of ways. Citizens of any age may sponsor their spouses and their children, but only citizens who have reached the age of 21 may sponsor siblings and parents.  (The Supreme Court decision ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' ruled in 2013 that same-sex spouses must be treated the same as opposite-sex spouses.)  Permanent residents may only sponsor spouses and unmarried children. In all cases, the sponsor must demonstrate the capacity to support their relative financially at 125% of the poverty level, and provide proof of the relationship. Immediate relatives of United States citizens (spouses, parents, and unmarried children under 21 years of age) are automatically eligible to immigrate upon approval of their application. All other people eligible to immigrate through a family member must wait for a place; a preference system governs the order at which these places become available. Citizens may only sponsor siblings, spouses, parents, and children. They cannot sponsor aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, grandparents, or grandchildren, though in some cases such relations may enjoy [[derivative status]].&lt;ref name="USCIS1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=0775667706f7d010VgnVCM10000048f3d6a1RCRD |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716030831/http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=0775667706f7d010VgnVCM10000048f3d6a1RCRD |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 July 2008 |title=Immigration through a Family Member |publisher=[[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] |accessdate=19 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On December 23, 2017, [[James Robart]], a [[United States federal judge|Senior US District Judge]], granted a nationwide injunction that blocks [[Presidency of Donald Trump|the administration]]’s restrictions on the process of reuniting refugee families and has partially lifted a ban on refugees from 11 mostly Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;washingtonpost.com: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/judge-partially-lifts-trump-administration-ban-on-refugees/2017/12/23/d8ed123a-e843-11e7-927a-e72eac1e73b6_story.html ''Judge’s partial lifting of Trump ban gives refugees hope'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

=====Immigration of parents of adult children=====
Under the [[Citizenship Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ''All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.''

Under existing law, parents of United States citizens may be sponsored for immigration by their adult citizen children (those at least 21 years of age) under certain conditions.&lt;ref name="USCIS1"/&gt; The child must demonstrate the financial ability to provide for the parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignborn.com/visas_imm/immigrant_visas/bring_other_family/3bringing_my_parents.htm|title=Green Card for Parents - Sponsoring Parents for Green Card|website=www.foreignborn.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this under current law and USCS policy individuals who entered illegally (EWI or Entry without Inspection) may not adjust in the country. However, leaving the United States triggers a ban on entering the U.S. If the parent was present in the U.S. for only between 180–364 days, the parent will receive a three-year ban. However, as is more common if the parent was present for 365 days or more, the parent will receive a ten-year ban on entering the United States. Unless the parent is willing to live out the ban outside the country, the parent may not regularize their status through the child. Parents who enter legally will not have to leave the U.S. to adjust their status unless they entered on K visas or entered on J visas and did not obtain a waiver for the foreign-stay period.

=====Immigration of parents of minors=====
Having U.S.-citizen minor children is beneficial in deportation proceedings when there is "extreme and profound hardship on the child" for the parent to be deported. The number of such hardship waivers is capped at 5000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fed-soc.org/publications/pubID.367/pub_detail.asp|title=Five Questions on Immigration Reform|first1=Margaret|last1=Stock|first2=John|last2=Eastman|date=2 May 2006|publisher=Federalist Society|accessdate=20 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817222914/http://www.fed-soc.org/publications/pubID.367/pub_detail.asp|archivedate=17 August 2009|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal appellate courts have upheld the refusal by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] to stay the deportation of illegal immigrants merely on the grounds that they have U.S.-citizen, minor children.&lt;ref name="CRSReport"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/data/2006/upl-meta-crs-9011/RL33079_2006May12.pdf?PHPSESSID=1ca373c497c7db6a81c7ca74a1445530.pdf|title=U.S. Citizenship of Persons Born in the United States to Alien Parents|last=Lee|first=Margaret Mikyung|date=12 May 2006|publisher=Congressional Research Service Report for Congress|pages=10, 17|accessdate=16 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some 3.1 million United-States-citizen children with at least one illegal immigrant parent as of 2005.

==Political Opposition to Family Reunification==
===United States===
Opponents of the current United States family reunification policy (who generally refer to the policy by the term, "[[chain migration]]") argue that the Hart-Celler Act's emphasis on family reunification resulted in the dramatic increase in migration in general.

According to the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] (FAIR), an immigration-restrictionist think tank, "chain migration--and the expectations and long lines it produces--increases illegal immigration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer?pagename=iic_immigrationissuecenters3e2a Home | Federation for American Immigration Reform]. Fairus.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally FAIR argues that "illegal aliens given amnesty by Congress in 1986 are now fueling naturalization in record numbers. As these former illegal aliens become citizens, all of their immediate relatives qualify to come immediately to the United States, and start new migration chains of their own." It is inaccurate, however, to suggest that relatives of new citizens "immediately" qualify for immigration to the United States, because strict restrictions on the numbers of family reunification visas mean that the average wait time for such qualification is in fact 18 to 23 years.&lt;ref name="Lind"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lind|first1=Dara|title=What 'Chain Migration' Really Means|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/29/16504272/chain-migration-family-how-trump-end|website=vox.com|publisher=Vox|accessdate=29 December 2017|date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NumbersUSA]], a group that lobbies Congress for lower levels of immigration, says that family reunification (which they refer to as "chain migration") is a main cause for creating incentives for illegal immigration.&lt;ref name="numbersusa1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120601002432/https://www.numbersusa.com/content/chain-migration.html-1 Chain Migration]. numbersusa.com&lt;/ref&gt;

NumbersUSA, FAIR, and other groups lobby to change immigration law to place limits on the US family reunification policy. NumbersUSA cites a specific bill it supports. “On Feb. 4, 2009, Rep. [[Phil Gingrey]] (R-GA) introduced the Nuclear Family Priority Act (H.R. 878). The bill would eliminate the extended family visa categories (e.g., married sons and daughters of citizens, etc.), thus ending 'chain migration' as recommended by the bi-partisan [[Barbara_Jordan#Career|Barbara Jordan Commission]] in 1997.”&lt;ref name="numbersusa1"/&gt;

President Donald Trump tweeted on November 1, 2017: “CHAIN MIGRATION must end now! Some people come in, and they bring their whole family with them, who can be truly evil. NOT ACCEPTABLE!” Trump’s wife, Melania, sponsored her Slovenian parents for [[Permanent residence (United States)|green cards]] in the United States, leading to them becoming naturalized citizens in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/nyregion/melania-trumps-parents-become-us-citizens.html|title=Melania Trump’s Parents Become U.S. Citizens, Using ‘Chain Migration’ Trump Hates|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gosselin (Tutor of) v Quebec (AG)''''', 2005 SCC 15, [2005] 1 SCR 238 is a [[leading case]] of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on the constitutional protection of [[minority language]] rights under [[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 23]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. The case was part of a trilogy of minority language rights cases including ''Solski (Tutor of) v Quebec (AG)'', 2005 SCC 14 and ''Okwuobi v Lester B Pearson School Board; Casimir v Quebec (AG); Zorrilla v Quebec (AG)'', 2005 SCC 16.

A number of [[French language|French]]-speaking families who wanted their children educated in English but did not qualify under the ''[[Charter of the French Language]]'' for English schooling challenged the French Charter as a violation of their equality rights under sections 10 and 12 of the ''[[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]''.

The Court rejected the claim. It held that the parents were not protected under the minority language rights provision in section 23 of the ''Canadian Charter''. The Court also found that the equality right cannot be used to invalidate other rights under the Constitution; consequently there was no violation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3932">'''Impeachment of the President of the Russian Federation''' — initiated by the Parliament's legal procedure, providing for the termination of the [[Russian President]] of his powers.

The impeachment procedure was carried out three times. All three times it was held against [[President of Russia|President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]], and all three times had failed.

== Legal procedure ==

In accordance with the current Russian legislation, the removal from office of the President are regulated by article 93 of the [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://constrf.ru/razdel-1/glava-4/st-93-krf Article 93 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation]&lt;/ref&gt; It provides for indictment by the [[State Duma]], should be accompanied by the opinion of the [[Supreme Court of Russia]] and [[Constitutional Court of Russia]] on observance of prescribed procedure for charging. The decision to impeach the President accepts the [[Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council]].

The decision of the State Duma on bringing charges and the decision of the Federation Council on dismissal of the President from office must be adopted by two-thirds of the total number in each of chambers (300 and 114 respectively) on the initiative of not less than one third (150) of deputies of the State Duma and with the conclusion of the special Commission formed by the State Duma. The decision of the Federation Council on impeachment of the President of the Russian Federation from office must be adopted not later than within three months after the extension of the State Duma of the charges against the President. If within this period the Federation Council's decision is not accepted, charges against the President shall be considered rejected.

The '''International Association of Insurance Supervisors''' ('''IAIS''') is a voluntary membership-driven [[standards organization|standards-setting]] organization of insurance supervisors and regulators from over 190 jurisdictions in more than 140 countries. Founded in 1994, it seeks to "supervise the insurance industry in order to develop and maintain fair, safe, and stable insurance markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Association Of Insurance Supervisors|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0850031D:SW-international-association-of-insurance-supervisors|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its members, approximately 135 observers representing international institutions, professional associations and insurance and reinsurance companies, as well as consultants and other professionals participate in IAIS activities. 

==Structure==
The IAIS is a nonprofit organisation formed under Article 60 of the Swiss Civil Code, domiciled in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. Its activities are supported by its secretariat and headed by a secretary general. The IAIS is hosted by the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS).

===Committees===
Under the direction of its Members, the IAIS conducts activities through a Committee system designed to achieve its mandate and objectives.
The IAIS Committee system is led by an Executive Committee whose members come from different regions of the world. It is supported by five Committees established by the By-Laws – the Audit, Budget, Financial Stability, Implementation, and Technical Committees – as well as by the Supervisory Forum. Committees may establish subcommittees or working parties to help carry out their duties.

==Activities==
Activities undertaken in furtherance of its mission can be divided into three categories:
# '''Standard setting:''' The IAIS develops supervisory material (principles, standards and guidance) for effective supervision of insurance-related activities. The IAIS also prepares supporting papers that provide background on specific areas of interest to insurance supervisors.
# '''Implementation:''' The IAIS actively promotes the implementation of its supervisory material. Working closely with international organisations, regional groups and supervisors, it supports training seminars and conferences and addresses financial inclusion. In addition, the IAIS conducts assessments and peer reviews of observance of supervisory material, consistent with the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted by the IMF and the World Bank.
# '''Financial stability:''' The IAIS plays a central role in financial stability issues, including developing a methodology for the identification of any global [[Systemically important financial institution|systemically important insurers]] (G-SIIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gary Hirst|year=2013|title=The International Association of Insurance Supervisors and Insurers that are Too Big to Fail|publisher=The Gary Hirst Insurance Blog|url=http://garyhirst.com/by-gary-hirst-the-international-association-of-insurance-supervisors-and-insurers-that-are-too-big-to-fail/|accessdate=2013-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assists its Members in developing enhanced macroprudential surveillance tools.

===Global coordination===
The IAIS coordinates its work with other international financial policymakers and associations of supervisors or regulators, and assists in shaping financial systems globally. In particular, the IAIS is a:
* Member of the [[Financial Stability Board]] (FSB)
* Founding member and co-parent of the [[Joint Forum]], along with the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] (BCBS) and the [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO)
* Member of the Standards Advisory Council of the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB)
* Partner in the Access to Insurance Initiative (A2ii)

The IAIS also participates as an observer or partner with numerous other organisations, including the Arab Forum of Insurance Regulatory Commissions (AFIRC), Asian Forum of Insurance Regulators (AFIR), Association of Latin American Insurance Supervisors (ASSAL), Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), Financial Action Task Force (FATF), International Actuarial Association (IAA), International Organisation of Pension Supervisors (IOPS), Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), Offshore Group of Insurance Supervisors (OGIS), Insurance and Private Pensions Committee (IPPC), [[OECD]], [[IMF]], and the World Bank.

===Global involvement===
The IAIS holds Committee meetings four times a year, as well as Working Party meetings as needed, throughout the world. At its June meetings, the IAIS hosts a Global Seminar affording insurance supervisors and industry representatives a unique opportunity to discuss current and globally significant matters impacting the insurance sector, as well as to learn about new international standards.

To further encourage multilateral discussions on topical issues for insurance supervisors and other insurance professionals, the IAIS holds an Annual Conference. In conjunction with this conference, it convenes an Annual General Meeting of Members where it conducts official business. 

==Publications==

The Global Insurance Market Report (GIMAR) collects and reports data reflecting the performance of primary insurers and reinsurers as well as key developments in the global insurance market. It builds on the previously issued Global Reinsurance Market Report, which has been incorporated as an integral part of the GIMAR. Publication of the GIMAR by the IAIS Secretariat began in October 2012. The GIMAR is based on publicly available data as well as confidential data submitted to the IAIS by about 50 reinsurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Insurance Market Report (GIMAR) Global Insurance Market Report (GIMAR)|url=https://www.iaisweb.org/page/supervisory-material/financial-stability-and-macroprudential-policy-and-surveillance/global-insurance-market-report-gimar|website=International Association of Insurance Supervisors|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage''' ('''BUNKER''') is an [[International treaty]] listed and administered by the [[International Maritime Organization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (BUNKER)|url=http://www.imo.org/en/About/conventions/listofconventions/pages/international-convention-on-civil-liability-for-bunker-oil-pollution-damage-(bunker).aspx|website=www.imo.org|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed in [[London]] on {{dts|23 March 2001}} and in force generally on {{dts|21 November 2008}}.  The purpose is to adopt uniform international rules and procedures for determining questions of liability and providing adequate compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/2009/14.html "International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage 2001 (London, 23 March 2001) – ATS 14 of 2009”]. Australasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Retrieved on 18 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the convention, Bunker Oil is fuel used to power the ship. The convention covers leakage of that oil, and requires signatories to the convention to have their ships appropriately insured against such leakages.

It is associated with and references:
* [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]]
* [[International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage]] (CLC [Convention])
* [[HNS Convention|International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea]] (HNS Convention)
* [[MARPOL 73/78|International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships]] (MARPOL)

While BUNKER is apparently similar to CLC Convention – they are substantially different. Unlike the CLC, the BUNKER Convention is not limited to persistent fuel oils and will apply to any hydrocarbon used to operate the ship.&lt;ref name="Gard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry into force of Bunker Convention – GARD|url=http://www.gard.no/web/updates/content/52003/entry-into-force-of-bunker-convention|website=www.gard.no|accessdate=30 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State parties==
While the convention has been widely adopted, notable exceptions includes [[Bolivia]], [[Honduras]], and [[Lebanon]]—which are generally [[flag of convenience]] states—have not ratified the treaty.&lt;ref name="marisec"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shipping Industry Flag State Performance Table |last=MARISEC |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=Maritime International Secretariat Services |location=London |isbn= |page= |pages=1–2 |url=http://www.marisec.org/shippingfacts/uploads/File/FlagStatePerformanceTable09.pdf?SID=lghwfzybi |accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the CLC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIABILITY AND COMPENSATION FOR SHIP-SOURCE OIL POLLUTION|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/dtltlb20114_en.pdf|website=unctad.org|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|accessdate=30 June 2017|pages=20, 23|date=31 January 2012|quote=[p20:] However, in some cases, substantial compensation may be available under applicable national law, as for instance in the case of the United States Oil Pollution Act 1990 (OPA 1990). [and p23:] [Non-signatories] includes notably the United States, where, however, strong national legislation to provide for liability and compensation has been enacted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States of America]] was a driver behind the BUNKER convention, and had legislation in place similar to BUNKER provisions, the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990]], hence it claimed, the treaty did not need to be signed.&lt;ref name="Gard" /&gt;

As of November 2018, the treaty has been ratified by 90 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, 2001|url=https://www.ecolex.org/details/international-convention-on-civil-liability-for-bunker-oil-pollution-damage-2001-tre-001377/participants/?|website=www.ecolex.org|accessdate=30 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jury nullification''' is a concept where members of a [[trial]] [[jury]] find a defendant not guilty if they do not support a government's law, do not believe it is constitutional or humane, or do not support a possible punishment for breaking the law. This may happen in both [[civil trial|civil]] and [[criminal trial]]s. In a criminal trial, a jury nullifies by [[Acquittal|acquitting]] a defendant, even though the members of the jury may believe that the defendant did commit the alleged crime. This may occur when members of the jury disagree with the law the defendant has been charged with breaking, or believe that the law should not be applied in that particular case. A jury can similarly convict a defendant on the ground of disagreement with an existing law, even if no law is broken (although in jurisdictions with [[double jeopardy]] rules, a conviction can be overturned on [[appeal]], but an acquittal cannot).

A jury verdict that is contrary to the [[letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]] pertains only to the particular case before it. If a pattern of acquittals develops, however, in response to repeated attempts to prosecute a statutory offence, this can have the [[Defacto|de facto]] effect of invalidating the statute. A pattern of jury nullification may indicate public opposition to an unwanted legislative enactment.

In the past, it was feared that a single judge or panel of government officials might be unduly influenced to follow established legal practice, even when that practice had drifted from its origins. In most modern Western legal systems, however, judges often instruct juries to act only as "[[finder of fact|finders of facts]]", whose role it is to determine the veracity of the evidence presented, the weight accorded to the evidence,&lt;ref name=jurisdictionaryfact /&gt; to apply that evidence to the law as explained by the judge, and to reach a verdict; but not to question the law or decide what it says. Similarly, juries are routinely cautioned by courts and some attorneys not to allow sympathy for a party or other affected persons to compromise the fair and dispassionate evaluation of evidence. These instructions are criticized by advocates of jury nullification. Some commonly cited historical examples of jury nullification involve jurors refusing to convict persons accused of violating the Fugitive Slave Act by assisting runaway slaves or being fugitive slaves themselves, and refusal of American colonial juries to convict a defendant under [[English law]].&lt;ref name= GaspeeAffair /&gt;

Juries have also refused to convict due to the perceived injustice of a law in general,&lt;ref name= PennsTrial1 /&gt;&lt;ref name= PennsTrial2 /&gt; or of the way the law is applied in particular cases.&lt;ref name= Ponting1985/&gt; There have also been cases where the jury has refused to convict due to their own [[prejudice]]s (for example, about the [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] of one of the [[party (law)|parties]] in the case).&lt;ref name= Kennedy1997/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:The Jury by John Morgan.jpg|thumb|right|A 19th-century jury]]

Jury nullification is the source of much debate. Some maintain that it is an important safeguard of last resort against wrongful imprisonment and government tyranny.&lt;ref name=Heffernan&amp;Kleinig2000/&gt;&lt;ref name= Jonakait2006/&gt; Others view it as a violation of the right to a [[jury trial]], which undermines the law.&lt;ref name= Jonakait2006/&gt; Some view it as a violation of the [[juror's oath|oath]] sworn by jurors. In the United States, some view the requirement that jurors take an oath to be unlawful in itself, while still others view the oath's reference to "deliverance" to ''require'' nullification of unjust law: "will well and truly try and a true deliverance make between the United States and the defendant at the bar, and a true verdict render according to the evidence, so help [me] God". {{cite court|litigants=United States v. Green|vol=556|reporter=F.2d|opinion=71|court=D.C. Cir.|date=1977}}&lt;ref name= Shapiro2003/&gt; Some fear that nullification could be used to permit violence against socially unpopular factions.&lt;ref name= jurylaw2007/&gt; They point to the danger that a jury may choose to convict a defendant who has not broken the letter of the law. However, judges retain the rights both to decide sentences and to [[judgment notwithstanding verdict|disregard juries' guilty verdicts]], acting as a check against malicious juries. Jury nullification may also occur in civil suits, in which the verdict is generally a finding of liability or lack of liability (rather than a finding of guilty or not guilty).&lt;ref name= Noah2001/&gt;

Nevertheless, there is little doubt as to the ability of a jury to nullify the law. Today, there are several issues raised by jury nullification, such as:
#whether juries can or should be instructed or informed of their power to nullify.
#whether a judge may remove jurors "for cause" when they refuse to apply the law as instructed.
#whether a judge may punish a juror for exercising the power of jury nullification.
#whether all legal [[argument]]s, except perhaps on motions ''[[in limine]]'' to exclude evidence, should be made in the presence of the jury.

In some cases in the United States, a [[stealth juror]] will attempt to get on a jury in order to nullify the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Stealth Juror: Reality or Rarity?|url=http://www.abanet.org/litigation/mo/premium-lt/articles/trialpractice/0707_gilleland.html|publisher=American Bar Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121134850/http://www.abanet.org/litigation/mo/premium-lt/articles/trialpractice/0707_gilleland.html|archivedate=2008-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lawyers use a [[shadow defense]] to get information entered into the record that would otherwise be inadmissible hoping that evidence will trigger a jury nullification.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Putting on a Jury Nullification Defense and Getting Away with It|author=Hall Jr., John Wesley|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Using Theories and Themes to Acquit the Guilty|author=Conrad, Clay|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common law precedent==
[[File:Sir Nicholas Throckmorton from NPG.jpg|thumb|Even prior to [[Bushel's Case]], Sir [[Nicholas Throckmorton]], a [[Episcopacy|non-Episcopalian]] [[English Dissenter]] or [[Nonconformists|Nonconformist]] outside of the established [[Church of England]], was acquitted by a jury, despite the hostility of the judges.]]
The early history of juries supports the recognition of the ''de facto'' power of nullification. By the 12th century, common law courts in England began using juries for more than administrative duties. Juries were composed primarily of "laymen" from the local community. They provided a somewhat efficient means of [[dispute resolution]] with the benefit of supplying legitimacy.

The general power of juries to decide on verdicts was recognised in the English [[Magna Carta]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html Magna Carta of 1215] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910155351/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html |date=September 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1215, which put into words existing practices:

{{quote|No free man shall be captured, and or imprisoned, or disseised of his freehold, and or of his liberties, or of his free customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed, nor will we proceed against him by force or proceed against him by arms, but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.

For a trivial offence, a free man shall be fined only in proportion to the degree of his offence, and for a serious offence correspondingly, but not so heavily as to deprive him of his livelihood. In the same way, a merchant shall be spared his merchandise, and a husbandman the implements of his husbandry, if they fall upon the mercy of a royal court. None of these fines shall be imposed except by the assessment on oath of reputable men of the neighbourhood.}}

Largely, the earliest juries returned verdicts in accordance with the judge or the Crown. This was achieved either by "packing the jury" or by "[[writ of attaint]]". Juries were packed by hand-selecting or by [[Bribery|bribing]] the jury so as to return the desired verdict. This was a common tactic in cases involving [[treason]] or [[sedition]]. In addition, the writ of attaint allowed a judge to retry the case in front of a second jury when the judge believed the first jury returned a "false verdict". If the second jury returned a different verdict, that verdict was imposed and the first jury was imprisoned or fined.

This history, however, is marked by a number of notable exceptions. In 1554, a jury acquitted Sir [[Nicholas Throckmorton]], but was severely punished by the court. Almost a century later in 1649, in the first known attempt to argue for jury nullification, a jury likewise acquitted [[John Lilburne]] for his part in inciting a rebellion against the [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] regime. The theoretician and politician [[Eduard Bernstein]] wrote of Lilburne's trial:

{{quote|His contention that the constitution of the Court was contrary to the fundamental laws of the country was unheeded, and his claim that the jury was legally entitled to judge not only as to matters of fact but also as to the application of the law itself, as the Judges represented only 'Norman intruders', whom the jury might here ignore in reaching a verdict, was described by an enraged judge as 'damnable, blasphemous heresy'. This view was not shared by the jury, which, after three days' hearing, acquitted Lilburne—who had defended himself as skilfully as any lawyer could have done—to the great horror of the Judges and the chagrin of the majority of the Council of State. The Judges were so astonished at the verdict of the jury that they had to repeat their question before they would believe their ears, but the public which crowded the judgment hall, on the announcement of the verdict, broke out into cheers so loud and long as, according to the unanimous testimony of contemporary reporters, had never before been heard in the Guildhall. The cheering and waving of caps continued for over half an hour, while the Judges sat, turning white and red in turns, and spread thence to the masses in London and the suburbs. At night bonfires were lighted, and even during the following days the event was the occasion of joyful demonstrations.&lt;ref name= Bernstein1895/&gt;}}

In 1653, Lilburne was on trial again and asked the jury to acquit him if it found the death penalty "unconscionably severe" in proportion to the crime he had committed. The jury found Lilburne "Not guilty of any crime worthy of death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Birch |editor-first=Thomas |title=A Collection of the State Papers of John Thurloe, Volume 1, 1638-1653 | publisher=Fletcher Gyles |location=London| publication-date=1742 |pages=435–445 |chapter= Slate Papers, 1653: August (5 of 5) |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/thurloe-papers/vol1/pp435-445 |access-date=1 December 2016 |via=British History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1670, a [[grand jury]] refused to convict [[William Penn]] of unlawful assembly in [[Bushel's Case]]. The judge attempted to find the jury in contempt of court; this was ruled inappropriate by the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]].

In 1681, a grand jury refused to [[Indictment|indict]] the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]]. Then in 1688, a jury acquitted the [[Seven Bishops]] of the [[Church of England]] of [[seditious libel]]. Juries continued, even in non-criminal cases, to act in defiance of the Crown. In 1763 and 1765, juries awarded £4,000 and £300 to [[John Wilkes]] and [[John Entick]] respectively, in separate suits for [[trespass]] against the Crown's messengers. In both cases, messengers were sent by Lord Halifax to seize allegedly [[libel]]ous papers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In [[Scotland]], jury nullification had the profound effect of introducing (or as others believed, reviving) the verdict of "[[Not proven#Not guilty|not proven]]". It was in 1728 that one [[Carnegie of Finhaven]] accidentally killed the Scottish [[Charles Lyon, 6th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earl of Strathmore]]. As the defendant had undoubtedly killed the Earl, the law (as it stood) required the jury merely to look at the facts and pass a verdict of "proven" or "not proven" depending on whether they believed the facts proved the defendant had killed the Earl.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, if the jury brought in a "proven" verdict they would in effect cause this innocent man to die. To avert this injustice, the jury decided to assert what it believed to be their "ancient right" to judge the whole case and not just the facts, rendering the verdict of "not guilty", which remains in Scotland to this day. Over time, however, juries have tended to favour the "not guilty" verdict over "not proven" and with this the interpretation has changed. Now the "not guilty" verdict has become the normal verdict when a jury is convinced of innocence and the "not proven" verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Standard jury trial practice in the United States during the Founding Era and for several decades afterward was to argue all issues of law in the presence of the jury, so that the jury heard the same arguments the bench did in reaching his rulings on motions. This is evidenced by such decisions as the 1839 case ''[[Stettinius v. United States|Stettinius v. U.S.]]'', in which it was held that "The defense can argue law to the jury before the court gives instructions."&lt;ref name= StettiniusvsUSrefFenwick1836/&gt; Later, judges began to demand the parties submit motions in writing, often before the jury was empaneled, to be argued and decided without the jury being present. This transition began with motions ''in limine'', to exclude evidence on which it was felt the jury should not hear the argument because they would be informed of the evidence to be excluded. Later that was expanded to include all legal argument, so that today, that earlier practice of arguing law before the jury has been largely forgotten, and judges even declare [[mistrial (law)|mistrials]] or overturn verdicts if legal argument is made to the jury.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Specific jurisdictions==

===Canada===
Although extremely rare, jury nullification does occur in Canada. However, as the prosecution has powers to [[Double jeopardy#Canada|appeal the resulting acquittal]], it lacks the finality found in the United States. That being said, the Crown cannot appeal on grounds of an unreasonable conviction but can only appeal on errors of law. In ''[[R. v. Latimer]]'', 2001 SCC 1,&lt;ref name= RvLatimer2001/&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] discussed jury nullification, and indicated it is a duty of the presiding justice to try to prevent it from occurring.

Perhaps the most famous cases of jury nullification in Canada were the various trials of [[Henry Morgentaler]], who openly operated a private abortion clinic in violation of the Criminal Code. Repeated attempts at prosecuting Morgentaler resulted in acquittals at jury trials in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1988 Supreme Court case, ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'', 1988 SCR 30,&lt;ref name= RvMorgentaler1988/&gt; a nullification was appealed all the way to the country's highest court, which struck down the law in question. In ''[[obiter dicta]]'', [[Chief Justice Dickson]] wrote:

{{quote|The contrary principle contended for by Mr. Manning, that a jury may be encouraged to ignore a law it does not like, could lead to gross inequities. One accused could be convicted by a jury who supported the existing law, while another person indicted for the same offence could be acquitted by a jury who, with reformist zeal, wished to express disapproval of the same law. Moreover, a jury could decide that although the law pointed to a conviction, the jury would simply refuse to apply the law to an accused for whom it had sympathy. Alternatively, a jury who feels antipathy towards an accused might convict despite a law which points to acquittal. To give a harsh, but I think telling example, a jury fueled by the passions of racism could be told that they need not apply the law against murder to a white man who had killed a black man. Such a possibility need only be stated to reveal the potentially frightening implications of Mr. Manning's assertions. ...

It is no doubt true that juries have a de facto power to disregard the law as stated to the jury by the judge. We cannot enter the jury room. The jury is never called upon to explain the reasons which lie behind a verdict. It may even be true that in some limited circumstances the private decision of a jury to refuse to apply the law will constitute, in the words of a Law Reform Commission of Canada working paper, "the citizen's ultimate protection against oppressive laws and the oppressive enforcement of the law" (Law Reform Commission of Canada, Working Paper 27, The Jury in Criminal Trials (1980)). But recognizing this reality is a far cry from suggesting that counsel may encourage a jury to ignore a law they do not support or to tell a jury that it has a right to do so.}}

The Supreme Court more recently issued a decision, ''R. v. Krieger'', 2006 SCC 47,&lt;ref name=RvKrieger2006/&gt; which confirmed that juries in Canada have the power to refuse to apply the law when their consciences require that they do so. Within this decision, it is stated that "juries are not entitled as a matter of right to refuse to apply the law—but they do have the power to do so when their consciences permit of no other course".&lt;ref name=RvKrieger2006/&gt;

===England and Wales===
By the late 17th century, the court's power to punish juries was removed in ''[[Bushel's Case]]''&lt;ref name= BushellsCase /&gt; involving a juror on the case against [[William Penn]]. Penn and [[William Mead (merchant)|William Mead]] had been arrested in 1670 for illegally preaching a [[Quaker]] sermon and disturbing the peace, but four jurors, led by Edward Bushell, refused to find them guilty. Instead of dismissing the jury, the judge sent them back for further deliberations. Despite the judge demanding a guilty verdict, the jury this time unanimously found Penn guilty of preaching but acquitted him on the charge of disturbing the peace and acquitted Mead of all charges. The jury was then subsequently kept for three days without "meat, drink, fire and tobacco" to force them to bring in a guilty verdict; when they failed to do so the judge ended the trial. As punishment the judge ordered the jurors imprisoned until they paid a fine to the court. Four jurors refused to pay the fine, and after several months, Edward Bushell sought a [[writ of habeas corpus|writ of ''habeas corpus'']]. Chief Justice Vaughan, sitting on the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], discharged the writ, released them, called the power to punish a jury "absurd", and forbade judges from punishing jurors for returning a verdict the judge disagreed with.&lt;ref name= Stern2002/&gt; This series of events is considered a significant milestone in the history of jury nullification.&lt;ref name= Abramson1994/&gt; The particular case is celebrated in a plaque displayed in the Central Criminal Court (the [[Old Bailey]]) in London.

In a criminal libel case, ''R. v. Shipley'' (1784), 4 Dougl. 73, 99 E.R. 774, at p.&amp;nbsp;824, [[Lord Mansfield]] disparaged the practice of jury nullification:

{{quote|So the jury who usurp the judicature of law, though they happen to be right, are themselves wrong, because they are right by chance only, and have not taken the constitutional way of deciding the question. It is the duty of the Judge, in all cases of general justice, to tell the jury how to do right, though they have it in their power to do wrong, which is a matter entirely between God and their own consciences.

To be free is to live under a government by law ... Miserable is the condition of individuals, dangerous is the condition of the State, if there is no certain law, or, which is the same thing, no certain administration of law, to protect individuals, or to guard the State.

...

In opposition to this, what is contended for? – That the law shall be, in every particular cause, what any twelve men, who shall happen to be the jury, shall be inclined to think; liable to no review, and subject to no control, under all the prejudices of the popular cry of the day, and under all the bias of interest in this town, where thousands, more or less, are concerned in the publication of newspapers, paragraphs, and pamphlets. Under such an administration of law, no man could tell, no counsel could advise, whether a paper was or was not punishable.}}

A 2016 study exploring the history of juror punishment in England and Wales after Bushel's Case found no clear examples of jurors being punished solely for returning the "wrong" verdict. The closest a jury came to this was in 1917, when a jury acquitted two teenage boys of arson. The boys had confessed at their pre-trial hearing, but had entered pleas of not guilty at their trial. Home Office civil servants suspected the difference between the pleas could be explained by the difference between the boys' admittance that they had caused the fire, and their denial that they had done so maliciously. The trial judge either did not consider this possibility or was not satisfied with it. On receiving the jury's verdict, he told them "you have been absolutely regardless of your oath. These men have pleaded guilty, and the evidence is of the clearest possible nature. You are none [''sic''] of you fit to serve on a Jury, but you will remain here until the end of the Sessions." The foreman, George Lathan, considered this a form of punishment for the jury, as the jurors were not going to be permitted to serve on any more juries, but were nonetheless required to keep attending court or face contempt proceedings. Lathan considered this a tacit form of imprisonment. Officials in the Lord Chancellor's Office noted that while the judge's conduct "was ill-judged and arbitrary, he did not, so far as I can see, do any act which would justify the Lord Chancellor in removing him from the Bench". Home Office officials wrote to the judge, advising him that his actions "would be impossible for the Home Secretary to defend as constitutional or right", and after several days the jurors were relieved of their duties. Home Office minutes suggest they did not think this kind of informal punishment of jurors who had returned the "wrong" verdict was unheard of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crosby|first1=Kevin|title=Before the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015: juror punishment in nineteenth- and twentieth-century England|journal=Legal Studies|date=2016|volume=36|issue=2|page=179 |doi=10.1111/lest.12098|url=https://www.academia.edu/33924828/Before_the_Criminal_Justice_and_Courts_Act_2015_Juror_Punishment_in_Nineteenth-and_Twentieth-Century_England_2016_36_2_Legal_Studies_179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, during the [[Falklands War]], the British [[Royal Navy]] sank an Argentine cruiser, the [[ARA General Belgrano|ARA ''General Belgrano'']]. Three years later a civil servant (government employee) named [[Clive Ponting]] leaked two government documents concerning the sinking of the cruiser to a Member of Parliament ([[Tam Dalyell]]) and was subsequently charged with breaching section 2 of the [[Official Secrets Act 1911]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Rosenbaum [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13430012 "Clive Ponting case: Where is the investigators' report?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504181302/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13430012 |date=May 4, 2016 }} ''[[BBC News]]''. 18 May 2011. Retrieved on 13 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution in the case demanded that the jury convict Ponting as he had clearly contravened the Act by leaking official information about the sinking of the Belgrano during the Falklands War. His main defence, that it was in the [[public interest]] that this information be made available, was rejected on the grounds that "the public interest is what the government of the day says it is", but the jury nevertheless acquitted him, much to the consternation of the Government. He had argued that he had acted out of "his duty to the interests of the state"; the judge had argued that [[civil servants]] owed their duty to the government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===United States===
{{Main article|Jury nullification in the United States}}
In the United States, jury nullification first appeared just before the [[American Revolutionary War]], when colonial juries frequently exercised their nullification power, principally in maritime cases and cases implicating free speech. Jury nullification became so common that many British prosecutors gave up trying maritime cases because conviction seemed hopeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKnight|first1=Aaron|title=Jury Nullification as a Tool to Balance the Demands of Law and Justice|url=http://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2890&amp;context=lawreview|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, juries sometimes refused to convict for violations of the [[Fugitive Slave Act]]. Later, during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], juries often nullified alcohol control laws,&lt;ref name= UMKC /&gt; possibly as often as 60% of the time.&lt;ref name= COUNTERPUNCH /&gt; This resistance may have contributed to the adoption of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first amendment]] repealing [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth amendment]].

In a well-known example of jury nullification, at the end of [[Wild Bill Hickok]]'s trial for the [[Wild Bill Hickok – Davis Tutt shootout|manslaughter of Davis Tutt]] in 1865, Judge [[Sempronius Boyd]] gave the jury two instructions. He first instructed the jury that a conviction was its only option under the law; he then instructed them that they could apply the unwritten law of the "fair fight" and acquit. Hickok was acquitted, a verdict that was not popular with the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/ucla/lubet48.htm "Legal Culture, Wild Bill Hickok and the Gunslinger Myth"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213073825/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/ucla/lubet48.htm |date=February 13, 2007 }} [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] Tarlton Law Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Richard (1959).

====Fugitive slave law====
Jury nullification was practiced in the 1850s to protest the federal [[Fugitive Slave Act]], which was part of the [[Compromise of 1850]]. The Act had been passed to mollify the slave owners from the South, who were otherwise threatening to secede from the Union. Across the North, local juries acquitted men accused of violating the law. Secretary of State [[Daniel Webster]] was a key supporter of the law as expressed in his famous "Seventh of March" speech. He wanted high-profile convictions.

The jury nullifications ruined his presidential aspirations and his last-ditch efforts to find a compromise between North and South. Webster led the prosecution when defendants were accused of rescuing [[Shadrach Minkins]] in 1851 from Boston officials who intended to return Minkins to his owner; the juries convicted none of the men. Webster tried to enforce a law that was extremely unpopular in the North, and his [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] passed over him again when they chose a presidential nominee in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Collison, {{"'}}This Flagitious Offense': Daniel Webster and the Shadrach Rescue Cases, 1851-1852", ''New England Quarterly'' Vol. 68, No. 4 (December 1995), pp. 609-625 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/365877 in JSTOR] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509175407/http://www.jstor.org/stable/365877 |date=May 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post Civil War====
White defendants accused of crimes against blacks and other minorities have often been acquitted by all-white juries, especially in the South, even in the face of irrefutable evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, Clay S. (1998). ''Jury Nullification, The Evolution of a Doctrine'', Carolina Academic Press, pp. 167–185. {{ISBN|0890897026}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====21st century====
In the 21st century, many discussions of jury nullification center on drug laws that some consider unjust either in principle or because they are seen to discriminate against certain groups.&lt;ref&gt;Fukurai, Hiroshi, and Richard Krooth (2003). ''Race in the jury box: affirmative action in jury selection''. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press. p. 178. {{OCLC|872139501}}&lt;/ref&gt; A jury nullification advocacy group estimates that 3–4% of all jury trials involve nullification,&lt;ref name= FIJA /&gt; and a recent rise in [[hung jury|hung juries]] is seen by some as being indirect evidence that juries have begun to consider the validity or fairness of the laws themselves.&lt;ref name= WashPost /&gt;

====Judicial opinion====
In the 1895 case of ''[[Sparf v. United States]]'' written by Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]], the United States Supreme Court held 5 to 4 that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Sparf v. United States|156|51|1895}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision, often cited, has led to a common practice by [[United States]] judges to penalize anyone who attempts to present a nullification argument to jurors and to declare a mistrial if such argument has been presented to them. In some states, jurors are likely to be struck from the panel during ''[[voir dire]]'' if they will not agree to accept as correct the rulings and instructions of the law as provided by the judge.&lt;ref name= PeoplevEstrada2006/&gt;

In recent rulings, the courts have continued to prohibit informing juries about jury nullification. In a 1969, [[Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals|Fourth Circuit]] decision, ''[[U.S. v. Moylan]]'', 417 [[F.2d]] 1002 (4th Cir.1969), the Court affirmed the concept of jury nullification, but upheld the power of a court to refuse to permit an instruction to the jury to this effect.&lt;ref name= USvsMoylan1969/&gt; In 1972, in ''[[United States v. Dougherty]]'', 473 [[F.2d]] 1113, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] issued a ruling similar to ''Moylan'' that affirmed the ''de facto'' power of a jury to nullify the law but upheld the denial of the defense's chance to instruct the jury about the power to nullify.&lt;ref name= USvsDougherty1972/&gt;

In 1988, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit]] upheld a jury instruction: "There is no such thing as valid jury nullification." In ''United States v. Thomas'' (1997), the Second Circuit ruled that jurors can be removed if there is evidence that they intend to nullify the law. The Supreme Court has not recently confronted the issue of jury nullification.

In 2017, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] upheld the first three sentences of the jury's instruction and overruled the second half. The jury instructions were "You cannot substitute your sense of justice, whatever that means, for your duty to follow the law, whether you agree with it or not. It is not for you to determine whether the law is just or whether the law is unjust. That cannot be your task. There is no such thing as valid jury nullification. You would violate your oath and the law if you willfully brought a verdict contrary to the law given to you in this case." However, they deemed this a [[harmless error]] and affirmed the conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reason.com/blog/2017/06/20/although-juries-can-acquit-the-guilty-9t|title=Juries Can Acquit the Guilty, 9th Circuit Says, but 'There Is No Right to Nullification'|date=2017-06-20|work=Reason.com|access-date=2017-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3812">'''Karly’s Law''' is a law that reformed [[child abuse]] investigation standards and procedures in the state of [[Oregon]]. Karly’s Law is named for a three-year-old girl, Karly Sheehan, who died as a result of child abuse and [[child neglect|neglect]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="saragelser"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saragelser.com/karly |title=Karly's Law |publisher=saragelser.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Karly's Law was first introduced as House Bill 3328 in 2007. It was created as a result of the death of Karly Sheehan in 2005. Karly was a three-year-old girl who died as a result of neglect and abuse from her mother's boyfriend. Her situation was brought to the attention of the Department of Health and Human Services as well as Law Enforcement, who interviewed Karly's mother, father and mother's significant other, and Karly twice and concluded that her injuries were not a result of child abuse.&lt;ref name="leg.state"&gt;Zacharias, Karen. A Silence of Mockingbirds. MacAdam/Cage {{ISBN|9781596923751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedural history==
The bill was proposed and sponsored by Rep Sara Gelser in 2007. It passed the [[Oregon House of Representatives]] unanimously on 30 April 2007, where it went on to the Oregon state Senate Human Services Committee.&lt;ref name="gazettetimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/house-gives-karly-s-law-unanimous-ok/article_ca4137f2-3475-59d2-b59d-c5a3497cc769.html |title=House gives 'Karly's Law' unanimous OK |publisher=Gazettetimes.com |date=2007-05-01 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oregon Senate]] also passed the bill unanimously, and it was sent back to the House with minor clarifying amendments. The House passed these amendments, and Gov. [[Ted Kulongoski]] signed it into law.&lt;ref name="gazettetimes_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/senate-passes-karly-s-law/article_064bd026-1328-52c4-994e-66bb8ddae10d.html |title=Senate passes ‘Karly’s law’ |publisher=Gazettetimes.com |date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law requirements==
The law mandates children with suspicious injuries during the course of an abuse investigation receive medical treatment within 48 hours.  The Oregon Department of Human Services and trained medical providers are to assess the injuries.  The law sets protocol and procedures if abuse is suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karly's Law|url=http://www.doj.state.or.us/victims/pages/karlys_law.aspx|work=State of Oregon|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After Karly's law was passed, the quantity of children who have been assessed for abuse in the state of Oregon rose by 140%.&lt;ref name="saragelser" /&gt; This does not imply a rise in the child abuse rates in the State of Oregon, simply that the number of children being inspected for possible child abuse-related injuries has gone up. In 2009, Oregon had 67,885 total referrals for child abuse and neglect. Of those, 28,584 reports were referred for investigation.&lt;ref name="cwla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwla.org/advocacy/statefactsheets/2011/oregon.pdf |title=Oregon's Children 2011 |publisher=Cwla.org |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the passage of HR 3328 in 2007, these numbers were: 46,524 total referrals for child abuse and neglect, 23,529 were referred for investigation in 2004.&lt;ref name="cwla_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwla.org/advocacy/statefactsheets/2006/oregon.pdf |title=Oregon's Children 2006 |publisher=Cwla.org |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy of law]], '''law as integrity''' is a theory of [[law]] put forward by the legal philosopher [[Ronald Dworkin]]. In general, it can be described as interpreting the law according to a [[community]].&lt;ref&gt;

In the many [[unidentified decedent]] cases in the world, there are several cases where the individual is eventually identified. Most bodies are provisionally identified within a matter of hours, with the formal identification following a few days, weeks, or months later. This list is for those bodies where that initial provisional identification failed for some reason. The majority of people in the list will be murder victims although it is not exclusive to them.

|On June 1, 1969 (some sources state June 2), a young white woman's body was found near a hiking trail on Pine Mountain, [[Harlan, Kentucky]]. She had been dead for several days to several weeks and was decomposed beyond recognition, possibly having been killed at another location before being taken to Pine Mountain. Near her body, fragments of a man's sweater and a ticket stub originating from an Ohio restaurant were found. The victim was between 16 and 22 years old and had been stabbed to death. Because of the condition of her body, it is not known if she had been sexually assaulted. She was later identified as 21-year-old Sonja Blair-Adams of Kentucky.

The location of her remains also indicated she could have come from any place in the country, a similar predicament as the [[Hudson County Jane Doe]]. Her hair was a dark blond and was worn in a ponytail, bound with a purple ribbon. The victim was between five feet five to five feet eight inches tall at a weight of 110 to 130 pounds.

A '''mandarin''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|官}}}} ''guān'') was a [[bureaucrat]] [[scholar-official|scholar]] in the government of [[Imperial era of Chinese history|imperial China]], [[Joseon|Korea]] and [[Nguyen Dynasty|Vietnam]].

The term is generally applied to the officials appointed through the [[imperial examination]] system; it sometimes includes and sometimes excludes the [[Chinese eunuch|eunuchs]] also involved in the governance of the two realms.

==History and use of the term==
The [[English language|English]] term comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mandarim'' (spelled in [[Old Portuguese]] as ''mandarin'' {{IPA-pt|ˌmɐ̃n.ðaˈɾĩn|pron}}). The Portuguese word was used in one of the earliest Portuguese reports about China: letters from the imprisoned survivors of the [[Tomé Pires]]' embassy, which were most likely written in 1524,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Letters from Portuguese captives in Canton, written in 1534 &amp; 1536: with an introduction on Portuguese intercourse with China in the first half of the sixteenth century
|publisher=Educ. Steam Press, Byculla|year= 1902
|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4njUAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=mandaris&amp;q=mandaris#v=snippet&amp;q=mandaris&amp;f=false
}}. The letters were not published at the time, but apparently distributed in manuscript form; Ferguson published the copy found in a Paris library. While Ferguson accepted the 1534 and 1536 dates given in the Paris manuscripts, later researchers concluded that in reality the letters were sent in 1524 ({{harvnb|Boxer|Pereira|Cruz|de Rada|1953|p=xxi}}). In the letters the word occurs numerous times in its  plural form, both with a final n/m: ''mandarĩs'', ''manderĩs'', ''manderỹs'' and without it: ''mandaris'',  ''manderys'', ''mandarys''. (Note that in the 16th-century Portuguese orthography, one would often put a tilde over a final vowel instead of writing an ''n'' or ''m'' after the vowel; thus ''ĩ'' or ''ỹ'' would be transcribed as ''in''/''im'' or ''yn''/''ym'' in most modern reprints.)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Fernão Lopes de Castanheda|Castanheda]]'s ''História do descobrimento e conquista da Índia pelos portugueses'' (c. 1559).&lt;ref&gt;Fernão Lopes de Castanheda, ''História do descobrimento e conquista da Índia pelos portugueses'', Vol. VI, cap II, 26. Castanheda's spelling (in plural) is still ''mandarins''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matteo Ricci]], who entered mainland China from Portuguese [[Macau]] in 1583, also said the Portuguese used the word.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matteo Ricci]], ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]''. Page 45 in the English translation, "China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci", Random House, New York, 1953. In the [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ original Latin], vol. 1, p. 51: "Lusitani Magistratus illos, à mandando fortasse, ''Mandarinos'' vocant, quo nomine iam etiam apud Europæos Sinici Magistratus intelliguntur".&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese word was thought by many to be related to ''mandador'' ("one who commands") and ''mandar'' ("to command"), from [[Latin]] ''mandare''.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Samuel |title=Dictionnary of the English Language |year=1827 |publisher=Longman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2dMJOBI0xukC&amp;pg=PT692}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Modern dictionaries, however, agree that it was in fact borrowed by Portuguese from the [[Malay language|Malay]] {{IPA-may|ˈməntəri|}}, which ultimately came from the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[mantri]]'' (''[[Devanagari]]: मंत्री'', meaning [[Political minister|counselor or minister]] – [[Etymology|etymologically]] linked to ''[[mantra]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mandarin Mandarin], [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mandarin Mandarin] [[Merriam-Webster]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"mandarin", {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
According to Malaysian Royal Professor [[Ungku Abdul Aziz]], the term had its origin when the Portuguese living in Malacca during the [[Malacca Sultanate]] wanted to meet with the higher officials in China, and used the term "menteri", but with an added "n" due to their poor grasp of the language, to refer to higher officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = PPSMI satu kesilapan | author = Ku Seman Ku Hussain | author2 = Hafizahril Abdul Hamid | work = Mingguan Malaysia | publisher = Utusan Melayu (M) Berhad | location = Kuala Lumpur | date = 19 July 2009 | page = 7 | language = Malay |trans-title=PPSMI a mistake | quote = Jadi perkataan menteri itu disebut kepada "menterin" dan apabila mereka pergi ke negeri China untuk berjumpa dengan pegawai tinggi akhirnya perkataan "menterin" tadi bertukar kepada "Mandarin". }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, before the term ''mandarin'' became widespread in the European languages, the word ''Loutea'' (with various spelling variations) was often used in Europeans' travel reports to refer to Chinese [[scholar-official]]s. It is frequently used, for example, in [[Galeote Pereira]]'s account of his experiences in China in 1548–1553, which was published in Europe in 1565, or (as ''Louthia'') in [[Gaspar da Cruz]]' ''Treatise of China'' (1569). As [[C.R. Boxer]] explains, the word comes from the Chinese 老爷 (Mandarin Pinyin: ''lǎoye''; [[Amoy dialect]]: ''ló-tia''; [[Quanzhou]] dialect: ''lāu-tia''), which was commonly used by people in China to address officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In the West, the term ''mandarin'' is associated with the concept of the [[scholar-official]], who immersed himself in poetry, literature, and [[Confucian]] learning in addition to performing [[civil service]] duties.

The [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|speech standard of the Ming and Qing empires]] was called "Mandarin language" by European missionaries, translating the Chinese name ''Guanhua'' ("the language of the officials") for this speech standard, which was current already in the Ming Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;''Guanhua'' is transcribed by [[Matteo Ricci]] and other early European writers as ''Quonhua'', in accordance with Ricci's transcription system that remained in use by [[Jesuits]] for a long time after his death. See pages 28–29 in the English translation, ''China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci'', Random House, New York, 1953. In the [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ original Latin],  ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]] suscepta ab Societate Jesu'' (1617), vol. 1, p. 31: "Præter hunc tamen cuique Provinciæ vernaculum sermonem, alius est universo regno communis, quem ipsi ''Quonhua'' vocant, quod curialem vel forensem sonat."&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "Mandarin" is also used to refer to modern [[Standard Chinese]], which evolved out of the earlier standard, and to the broader group of [[Mandarin dialects]] spoken across northern and southwestern China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History==
From 605 to 1905, mandarins were selected by merit through the extremely rigorous [[imperial examination]].

China has had civil servants since at least the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. However, most high ranking positions were filled by relatives of the sovereign and the [[Chinese nobility|nobility]].  It was not until the [[Tang Dynasty]] when the final form of the mandarin was completed with the replacement of the [[nine-rank system]].  The mandarins were the founders and core of the [[gentry (China)|Chinese gentry]]. A governmental office (for example, a central government department or a provincial civil governorate) headed by a mandarin is called a ''[[yamen]]''. The mandarins were replaced with a modern civil service after the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. 

[[Vietnam]], after becoming free of Chinese rule and setting up its own independent monarchy, emulated the Chinese system of mandarins in its civil service. The last mandarins in history were in service of the [[State of Vietnam]] (1949-1955).

==Ranks under the Qing dynasty==
The [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) divided the bureaucracy into civil and military positions, both having nine grades or ranks, each subdivided into primary and secondary categories.&lt;ref name="Jackson &amp; Hugus"&gt;Beverly Jackson and David Hugus ''Ladder to the Clouds: Intrigue and Tradition in Chinese Rank ''(Ten Speed Press, 1999) pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil appointments ranged from attendant to the emperor or a Grand Secretary in the Forbidden City (highest) to being a [[County magistrate (China)|county magistrate]], prefectural tax collector, deputy jail warden, deputy police commissioner or tax examiner.  Military appointments ranged from being a field marshal or chamberlain of the imperial bodyguard to a third class sergeant, corporal or a first or second class private.&lt;ref name="Jackson &amp; Hugus"/&gt;

In the table below, "''n''a" is shorthand for the "''n''th rank, primary" (正''n''品), which is a higher sub-rank than "''n''th rank, secondary" (從''n''品), denoted as  "''n''b" in the table.

During the Qing dynasty, the governor of a [[Provinces of China|Chinese province]], was signified by wearing a mandarin hat-pin made of [[ruby]].  The lower ranks of mandarins were signified by hat-pins made of [[coral]], [[sapphire]], [[lapis lazuli]], white [[jade]], [[gold]], and [[silver]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonavia, David ''Peking'' New York:1978 Time-Life Books ''Great Cities of the World'' series Page 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figurative meaning==
In modern [[English language|English]], ''mandarin'' is also used to refer to any (though usually a senior) [[civil servant]], often in a satirical context,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. as in the titles of such works as ''[[The Mandarins]]'' by [[Simone de Beauvoir]], Chomsky's [[American Power and the New Mandarins]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]].

August 15, 1967 in [[Bremen]], [[Germany]]) is Inge Rennert Professor of Law at [[New York University]] School of Law, as well as holding a Research Professorship on "Globalization and the Rule of Law" at the [[Social Science Research Center Berlin|Social Science Research Center]] (''Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung, WZB'') and [[Humboldt University]] in Berlin.

He has taught and lectured at leading universities worldwide and was a Visiting Professor and John Harvey Gregory Lecturer on World Organization at [[Harvard Law School]]. Kumm holds a JSD from Harvard Law School and has pursued studies in law, philosophy and [[political science]]s at the [[University of Kiel]], [[Paris]] I Pantheon [[Sorbonne]] and Harvard University. Kumm is on the editorial board of several journals.

Kumm's research and teaching focuses on basic issues in Global, European and Comparative Public Law. His work emphasizes the analytical and normative connection between law, claims to legitimate authority and public reason and the institutional conditions under which such claims can be made plausible. He argues for the need to reconceive the liberal-democratic constitutional tradition in [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] and [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] terms. Among his intellectual influences are [[Hans Kelsen]], [[Robert Alexy]], and [[Ronald Dworkin]].

Professor Mattias Kumm lives and works in New York City and Berlin.

A '''politician''' is a person active in [[Political party|party]] [[politics]], or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = politician {{!}} someone who is active in government usually as an elected official|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/politician|website = www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a "politician" can be anyone who seeks to achieve [[political power]] in any [[bureaucratic]] institution.

== Identity ==
Politicians are people who are politically active, especially in party politics. Positions range from local offices to executive, legislative, and judicial offices of regional and national governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/politician |title=politician - Webster's New World College Dictionary |publisher=Yourdictionary.com |date=2013-05-21 |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordfind.com/word/politician/ |title=politician - Princeton Wordnet dictionary |publisher=wordfind.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some elected law enforcement officers, such as [[sheriff]]s, are considered politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaines, Miller|first=Larry, Roger LeRoy|title=Criminal Justice in Action|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|isbn=978-1111835576|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant, Grant|first=Donald Lee, Jonathan|title=The Way It Was in the South: The Black Experience in Georgia|year=2001|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0820323299|page=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media and rhetoric==
Politicians are known for their rhetoric, as in speeches or campaign advertisements. They are especially known for using common themes that allow them to develop their political positions in terms familiar to the voters.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Charteris-Black, ''Politicians and rhetoric: The persuasive power of metaphor'' (Palgrave-MacMillan, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians of necessity become expert users of the media.&lt;ref&gt;Ofer Feldman, ''Beyond public speech and symbols: Explorations in the rhetoric of politicians and the media'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians in the 19th century made heavy use of newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets, as well as posters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Dinkin, ''Campaigning in America: A History of Election Practices'' (1989) [https://www.questia.com/library/1904945/campaigning-in-america-a-history-of-election-practices online]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, they branched into radio and television, making television commercials the single most expensive part of an election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Hall Jamieson and Keith Spillette, ''The Press Effect: Politicians, Journalists, and the Stories that Shape the Political World'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, they have become increasingly involved with the social media based on the Internet and smart phones.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel G. Pearlman, ''Margin of Victory: How Technologists Help Politicians Win Elections'' (2012) [https://www.questia.com/library/120087477/margin-of-victory-how-technologists-help-politicians online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rumor#Political communication strategy|Rumor]] has always played a major role in politics, with negative rumors about an opponent typically more effective than positive rumors about one's own side.&lt;ref&gt;David Coast and Jo Fox, "Rumour and Politics" ''History Compass'' (2015), 13#5 pp 222-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bureaucracy and spoils==
Once elected, the politician becomes a government official and has to deal with a permanent bureaucracy of non-politicians. Historically, there has been a subtle conflict between the long-term goals of each side.&lt;ref&gt;Joel D. Aberbach,  Robert D. Putnam, and Bert A. Rockman, eds., '' Bureaucrats and politicians in western democracies'' (Harvard University Press, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; In patronage-based systems, such as the United States and Canada in the 19th century, winning politicians replace the bureaucracy with local politicians who formed their base of support, the "[[spoils system]]". Civil service reform was initiated to eliminate the corruption of government services that were involved.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Schultz, and Robert Maranto, eds., ''The politics of civil service reform'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in many less developed countries, the spoils system is in full-scale operation today.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Szeftel, "Political graft and the spoils system in Zambia—the state as a resource in itself." ''Review of African Political Economy'' 9.24 (1982): 4-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Careers==
Mattozzi and Merlo argue that there are two main career paths which are typically followed by politicians in modern democracies. First come the career politicians. They are politicians who work in the political sector until retirement. Second are the "political careerists". These are politicians who gain reputation for expertise in controlling certain bureaucracies, then leave politics for a well-paid career in the private sector making use of their political contacts.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Mattozzi and Antonio Merlo, "Political careers or career politicians?." ''Journal of Public Economics'' 92#3 (2008): 597-608.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Numerous scholars have studied the characteristics of politicians, comparing those at the local and national levels, and comparing the more liberal or the more conservative ones, and comparing the more successful and less successful in terms of elections.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy S. Prinz, "The career paths of elected politicians: a review and prospectus." in Shirley Williams and Edward L. Lascher, eds. ''Ambition and beyond: career paths of American politicians'' (1993) pp: 11-63.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, special attention has focused on the distinctive career path of women politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Elina Haavio-Mannila and Torild Skard, eds. ''Unfinished Democracy: women in Nordic politics'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are studies of the "Supermadre" model in Latin American politics.&lt;ref&gt;Elsa M. Chaney, ''Supermadre: Women in Politics in Latin America'' (University of Texas Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many politicians have the knack to remember thousands of names and faces and recall personal anecdotes about their constituents—it is an advantage in the job, rather like being seven-foot tall for a basketball player. United States Presidents [[George W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] were renowned for their memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Iwan W. Morgan|title=Assessing George W. Bush's Legacy: The Right Man?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WfFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|year=2010|page=45|isbn=9780230114333}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James E. Mueller|title=Tag Teaming the Press: How Bill and Hillary Clinton Work Together to Handle the Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dw8SBZ6KRqYC&amp;pg=PA32|year=2008|page=32|isbn=9780742563926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many critics attack politicians for being out of touch with the public. Areas of friction include the manner in which politicians speak, which has been described as being overly formal and filled with many euphemistic and metaphorical expressions and commonly perceived as an attempt to "obscure, mislead, and confuse".&lt;ref&gt;Invitation to Critical Thinking - Page 319, Vincent E. Barry - 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the popular image, politicians are thought of as clueless, selfish, incompetent and [[Political corruption|corrupt]], taking money in exchange for goods or services, rather than working for the general public good.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold J. Heidenheimer and Michael Johnston, eds. ''Political corruption: Concepts and contexts'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians in many countries are regarded as the "most hated professionals".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold J. Heidenheimer and Michael Johnston, eds. ''Political corruption: Concepts and contexts'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ex-politicians who could not bear the leadership in politics that causes reprisals for critical thought criticize those who remain politicians for lacking critical thought.&lt;ref&gt;Knapptryckarkompaniet, Anne-Marie Palsson, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "RECAP" derives from "PACER", spelled backward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCullagh |first1=Declan |authorlink1=Declan McCullagh |title=Plug-in opens up federal courts, with your help |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/plug-in-opens-up-federal-courts-with-your-help/ |accessdate=May 16, 2017 |work=CNET |date=August 14, 2009 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PACER continued charging per page fees after the introduction of RECAP.&lt;ref name="Singel2009"&gt;{{cite news|title=FBI Investigated Coder for Liberating Paywalled Court Records|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=October 5, 2009|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=Condé Nast|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/10/swartz-fbi/|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the introduction of RECAP, activist [[Aaron Swartz]] set up an automatic download from an official library entry point to PACER. Swartz downloaded 2.7 million documents, all public domain, representing less than 1 percent of the documents in PACER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Timothy B.|title=The inside story of Aaron Swartz’s campaign to liberate court filings|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=2013-05-31|date=2013-02-08|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/02/the-inside-story-of-aaron-swartzs-campaign-to-liberate-court-filings/}}&lt;/ref&gt; These public domain documents were later uploaded to RECAP and made available to the public for free. However, the automated downloading triggered a government investigation. No criminal charges were filed, because PACER had provided lawful access and the documents copied were in the public domain, and the case was closed. 

Some courts have acknowledged RECAP's free distribution of documents. A small handful of PACER users receive fee-exempt access (fee waivers are granted on a district-by-district basis), and a condition of the fee waiver generally requires that fee exempt users not further distribute documents they receive under the waiver, pursuant to Judicial Conference policy.&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;{{cite web|

'''RedFox''' (formerly '''SlySoft''') is a software development company based in [[Belize]]. The company is most prominently known for its software [[AnyDVD]], which can be used to bypass [[copy protection]] measures on [[optical media]], including [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] media, as well as [[CloneCD]], which is used to back up the contents of optical discs.

The company formerly operated as the  [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St. John's]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]]-based '''SlySoft'''. At some point in February 2016, SlySoft shut down, with its home page replaced by a message citing "recent regulatory requirements".&lt;ref name="ars-slysoft"&gt;{{cite web|title=DRM defeaters defeated?

SlySoft developers also revealed that none of the company's staff were actually based in Antigua, that the company was not involved in legal settlements from AACS LA, and that key staff members still had access to SlySoft's technical infrastructure—including [[build system]]s and licensing servers—feasibly allowing development of AnyDVD to continue.&lt;ref name="tf-mulling"&gt;{{cite web|title=AnyDVD Admins &amp; Developers Mull Comeback|url=https://torrentfreak.com/anydvd-admins-developers-mull-comeback-160229/|website=TorrentFreak|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AACS and BD+==
SlySoft was the first to offer [[Advanced Access Content System|AACS]] circumvention that worked for any disc available; previous programs only cracked "compatible" discs using a database of known keys.

On 8 November 2007, SlySoft claimed to have completely cracked [[BD+]].  However, this turned out to be incorrect, as subsequent versions of BD+ security code have caused SlySoft to re-design its software.  On 3 March 2008, SlySoft updated AnyDVD HD allowing the full decryption of BD+,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://forum.slysoft.com/showthread.php?t=14786 |title=SlySoft Press Release |publisher=Forum.slysoft.com |date=2008-03-19 |accessdate=2012-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210011713/http://forum.slysoft.com/showthread.php?t=14786 |archivedate=10 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for not only the viewing of the film itself but also playing and copying disks with third-party software.  A third iteration of BD+ was released in November 2008, and was announced to be cracked by SlySoft with the release of AnyDVD HD 6.5.0.2 on 29 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://forum.slysoft.com/showthread.php?t=24602 |title=SlySoft defeats Blu-ray's BD+ DRM scheme again |publisher=Forum.slysoft.com |date=2008-12-29 |accessdate=2012-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223230155/http://forum.slysoft.com/showthread.php?t=24602 |archivedate=23 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A fourth version of BD+ security code was discovered with the movie ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'' on 17 February 2009, thwarting the effectiveness of SlySoft's software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://forum.slysoft.com/showthread.php?t=27330|title=BD+ discs that may not work properly with AnyDVD HD|publisher=Forum.slysoft.com|date=|accessdate=2012-06-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930155346/http://forum.slysoft.com/showthread.php?t=27330|archivedate=30 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/16313.cfm |title=BD+ re-secured, SlySoft beaten |publisher=Afterdawn.com |date=2008-12-13 |accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 19 March 2009, SlySoft updated AnyDVD HD to version 6.5.3.1 which allowed the decryption of the new version of BD+ used by ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slysoft.com/download/changes_anydvd.txt |title=AnyDVD Version Change Log |date= |accessdate=2012-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118095900/http://slysoft.com/download/changes_anydvd.txt |archivedate=18 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Licensing ==
{{Cleanup section|reason=post-2011 info lists no sources, and isn't written in an encyclopedic tone.|date=May 2016}}
On 1 December 2008 SlySoft announced it would for the first time begin charging its customers for updates to its software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://forum.slysoft.com/showthread.php?t=23279 |title=Press release: SlySoft announces new update policy |publisher=Forum.slysoft.com |date=2008-12-01 |accessdate=2012-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119172249/http://forum.slysoft.com/showthread.php?t=23279 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, SlySoft initially announced the discontinuation of the lifetime licensing option beginning January 2011. An e-mail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediasmartserver.net/2010/11/26/slysoft-to-discontinue-lifetime-subscriptions-for-anydvd/ |title=Original text of the announcement |publisher=Mediasmartserver.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; announcing the change ahead of time was sent to all registered customers allowing everyone the chance to purchase the lifetime option "while it is still possible;" and the notice was posted to their official forums. In January 2011, all announcements regarding the change were deleted without comment and a new structured licensing plan was put into place; including the lifetime licensing option at the highest priced tier. SlySoft was able to balance the internal cost matter and the licensing strategy in such a way as to allow continuation of the "lifetime" license option.  The 'update service' will only allow updates with a valid license and users are warned if they attempt to install an update beyond the license expiry date. If the user cancels the update the current paid-up license will continue to work. If the user continues then a "renewal" is required.

Following the collapse of Slysoft, holders of a SlySoft AnyDVD/AnyDVD HD Lifetime License are required to purchase a new license for use with the RedFox software beginning with Version 8.0.2.0. Version 7.6.9.5 will be able to use the prior license interminably, however it will not have access to updates for the latest decryption of copy-protection.&lt;ref&gt;https://forum.redfox.bz/threads/redfox-licensing-pricing.69083/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Refuge Water Supply Program (RWSP)''' is administered by the [[United States Department of the Interior]] jointly by the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] and [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] and tasked with acquiring a portion and delivering a total of 555,515 [[acre feet]] (AF) of water annually to 19 specific protected wetland areas in the Central Valley of California as mandated with the passing of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act signed on October 30, 1992 by President [[George H. W. Bush]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/mp/cvpia/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== The Central Valley Project (CVP) ===
The [[Central Valley (California)]] once contained over 4 million acres of naturally occurring wetlands that provided habitat: land, food, and shelter for resident and migratory birds and wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fwspubs.org/doi/suppl/10.3996/012014-JFWM-003/suppl_file/012014-jfwm-003.s10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Valley, historically and today, constitutes a significant portion of the [[Pacific Flyway]] used by millions of migrating birds each year.

The Central Valley's winter flood-prone geography and summer dry climate were natural constraints to permanent human settlement. The [[Central Valley Project]] (CVP); an interconnected engineered system of reservoirs, aqueducts and flood control measures, constructed by the US Bureau of Reclamation; managed flooding and provided reliable water supplies year-round with highly managed and calculated water storage, release and conveyance infrastructure. Along with the construction of similar facilities by others, the CVP's flood control and water delivery systems created a stable environment suitable for permanent human development in the Central Valley.

Controlling and manipulating the water supply for human benefit dramatically and quickly transformed the landscape. All but 400,000 acres of natural wetlands were transformed for development, a reduction in wetland area of 90%. The loss of wetlands concentrated the migrating and resident wildlife on less land and required their sharing of and dependence on less water. This unhealthy crowding caused bird populations to decline as they suffered from disease and the lack of necessary food, shelter, and water. Compounding the problem, human activity, in some cases, polluted the waters that flowed into the remaining wetlands. The [[Kesterson Reservoir]] disaster provided a clear indication that wildlife was suffering in the modified Central Valley and helped inspire actions to mitigate for the CVP's effects to bird and fish populations.

=== Central Valley Project Improvement Act ===
The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) was signed into law on October 30, 1992 as mitigation and remedy for some of the CVP's adverse environmental effects, specifically, to increase the population and improve the health of the Central Valley's [[anadromous]] fish and increase the acreage and health of wetlands used by migratory birds and other resident wildlife. The CVPIA is managed by the United States Department of Interior through collaboration between the Bureau of Reclamation and the Fish and Wildlife Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/mp/cvpia/title_34/public_law_complete.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Refuge Water Supply Program ==
[[File:RWSP Refuge Map.jpg|thumbnail|left|Map of the Refuges Supported by the RWSP]]
CVPIA Section 3406(d) mandates that 555,515 AF of water of suitable quality be delivered to maintain and improve wetland habitat areas in 19 wetland areas specifically identified in the ''Report on Refuge Water Supply Investigations (March 1989)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usbr.gov/mp/cvpia/3406d/resc_docs/Report%20on%20Refuge%20Water%20Supply%20Investigations%20('89%20Report).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''San Joaquin Basin Action Plan/Kesterson Mitigation Action Plan (December 1989)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm15911.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15911coll2/id/24110}}&lt;/ref&gt; collectively referred to as 'the Refuges'. These Refuges comprise nearly 200,000 acres of wetlands and as such represent almost 50% of the wetlands remaining in California's Central Valley. Reclamation created the Refuge Water Supply Program (RWSP) to manage and administer the activities necessary to ensure the acquisition and delivery of this water as required under this section. Like the CVPIA, the RWSP is administered jointly by the Bureau of Reclamation (from the Mid-Pacific Regional Office in Sacramento, CA) and the Fish and Wildlife Service (from the Pacific Southwest Regional Office in Sacramento, CA)

=== The Refuges ===

==== National Wildlife Refuges ====
The following Refuges, benefiting from CVPIA legislation, are administered by the Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service as National Wildlife Refuges. In some instances the specific Refuge named in the CVPIA is currently a constituent part of a FWS administrative complex of refuges that includes several such refuges and/or other non-benefiting lands.

The following CVPIA benefiting refuges are components of the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex: [[Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Delevan National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Colusa National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Sutter National Wildlife Refuge]].

The following CVPIA benefiting Refuges are components of the [[San Luis National Wildlife Refuge]] Complex: San Luis Unit, West Bear Creek Unit, East Bear Creek Unit, Kesterson Unit, Freitas Unit and [[Merced National Wildlife Refuge]]. The refuges currently identified as 'Units' were separate refuges at the time the legislation was written and passed.

The following CVPIA benefiting Refuges are components of the Kern National Wildlife Refuge Complex: [[Kern National Wildlife Refuge]] and [[Pixley National Wildlife Refuge]]

==== California State Wildlife Areas ====
The following Refuges, benefiting from CVPIA legislation, are administered by the State of California, Department of Fish and Wildlife as Wildlife Areas. In some instances the specific Refuge named in the CVPIA is currently a part of a DFW administrative unit that includes several such refuges and/or other non-benefiting lands.

Gray Lodge Wildlife Area; Los Banos Wildlife Area (portion); the following currently designated 'units' of the North Grasslands Wildlife Area, China Island Unit and Salt Slough Unit; and the Volta Wildlife Area (portion). Note: 'portion', is used to indicate that the current existing wildlife area boundary is larger than it was in the defining report. CVP water obligated for the RWSP is only permitted to be used on that portion of the wildlife area specifically described in the defining report and legislation.

==== The Grasslands Resource Conservation District ====
The Grassland Resource Conservation District (GRCD) comprises 75,000 acres of land including: the Grassland Water District (GWD) which provides water to 165 hunting clubs; the Kesterson and Freitas Units of the San Luis National wildlife Refuge (NWR); Volta Wildlife Management Area (WMA); Los Banos WMA; and privately owned wetlands. As such, the GRCD includes 60,000 acres of privately owned hunting clubs, 12,000 acres of land owned by the Federal and state governments, and 3,000 acres of cropland. The federal and state Refuges identified in the CVPIA legislation that are within the GRCD do not share GRCD's water allocation. 
[[File:RWSP Water Types.jpg|thumbnail|right|Full Level 4 Water Delivery Totals by Water Type]]
[[File:RWSP Contract Quantities.jpg|thumbnail|right|RWSP Contract Quantities]]

=== The Water ===
The water associated with the program is either categorized as Level 2 or Incremental Level 4 and there are different supply quantities and characteristics of each. The goal of the program is to provide the 'Full Level 4' water quantity which is the cumulative sum of the full quantity of each category for each Refuge. Program-wide, typically between 75% and 85% of Full Level 4 is delivered annually.

The water the RWSP provides accounts for varying portions of an individual Refuge's total water supply. Because some Refuges do not have adequate conveyance capacity to them (Pixley NWR, Merced NWR, Sutter NWR, East Bear Creek Unit and Gray Lodge WA) delivered water supplies vary annually with hydrological and climactic conditions.  Construction projects enabling these Refuges to receive water supplies have been identified and in some cases are progressing but funding limitations will likely cause this condition to persist.

==== Full Level 4 ====
The amount of water identified as being required for the optimal management of a designated wetland is defined as that refuge's 'Full Level 4' quantity. The 555,515AF of water the RWSP is tasked with providing is the sum of all of the specified refuges' Full Level 4 quantities. Full Level 4 is a contractually obligated amount of water that consists of 2 blocks, Level 2 and Incremental Level 4. Each refuge has a 'Full Level 4' quantity which is the sum of its total Level 2, and total Incremental Level 4 quantity of water. These amounts are provided in the table "RWSP Contract Water Quantities".

==== Level 2 Water ====
Each of the 19 benefiting Refuges has its own Level 2 water quantity which is based on the average water supplies necessary to maintain the wetland areas in existence prior to the passing of the CVPIA or equate to its prior dependably delivered quantity (regardless of water quality) and collectively totals 422,251 AF. For this reason the delivery of a Refuge's Level 2 allocation is considered to be essential for a Refuge's successful operation.

For those refuges that have the infrastructure to receive it, Level 2 water comes from the CVP, meaning a fixed portion of the federal water supply stored and delivered by the CVP Project is automatically dedicated annually for Refuge use and thus provides a perennially reliable water source. The RWSP manages and funds several long-term contracts (5 – 40 years) with a variety of water agencies to convey this water from its CVP source to a Refuges' boundaries.

It is important to note that the individual Refuges determine the amount of this water to be delivered, per month, at their discretion. This is a unique condition because most CVP water contracts impose limitations on both the total monthly delivery amount and the months in which deliveries may occur.

==== Incremental Level 4 Water ====
The incremental difference between the Refuges' Full Level 4 allocation and its Level 2 allocation defines Incremental Level 4 (IL4) and represents the quantity of water necessary for Refuges to ideally manage all lands identified in the refuge reports for the benefit of waterfowl. In most cases IL4 water is needed to fully support an expanded wetland footprint. Like Level 2 water, each refuge has its own Incremental Level 4 quantity but unlike Level 2 supplies, this water is not dedicated from CVP supply and must be acquired from other sources, such as willing sellers or from those relinquishing their federal or state supplies. The RWSP manages and funds contracts of varied duration to acquire and convey this water from its source to the refuges' boundaries. The suppliers, availability and cost of water available as Incremental Level 4 is less predictable than Level 2 supplies because of unpredictable region-wide water needs and usage; the potential lack of sufficient conveyance infrastructure; inconsistent annual natural conditions, specifically rainfall; and occasional water quality concerns.

Additionally, Individual refuges retain the right to refuse to accept water that the RWSP has the ability to acquire if it is not of suitable quality or does not benefit the refuge at the time it is available. Thus, water supplied delivered in a year may be less than those that were potentilly available.

=== RWSP Program Components ===
[[File:San Luis Reservoir 1.jpg|thumbnail|right|The San Luis Reservoir is a storage facility that holds water destined for many refuges in the San Joaquin Valley and other uses.]]
[[File:Shasta dam 2.jpg|thumbnail|right|Lake Shasta is the ultimate source of much of the refuges' Level 2 Water Supply]]
[[File:Delta-Mendota Canal.jpg|thumbnail|right|A Portion of the Delta Mendota Canal]]
The RWSP's efforts are concentrated into 3 components, Water Acquisition, Facility Construction and Water Conveyance.

==== Water Acquisitions ====
CVPIA Section 3406(d)(2) requires the acquisition of IL4 Water for critical wetland habitat supporting resident and migratory waterfowl, threatened and endangered species, and wetland dependent aquatic biota on the Refuges. These supplies are ideally used to allow refuges to optimally manage the preserved land for the improvement of waterfowl populations.

IL4 water consists of long-term and annual purchases from willing sellers of both surface and groundwater supplies; supplies at no cost, e.g., water exchanges; water delivered under a mitigation agreement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and 'permanent water', water that the program has purchased a permanent right to take under specific conditions.

===== North Valley Regional Recycled Water Program =====
California, and the Central Valley, experienced persistent drought conditions for much of the early part of the twenty first century. With global warming expected alter historic conditions the long-term availability oh IL4 supplies is questionable. To meet its acquisition and delivery mandate the RWSP was challenged to find reliable and affordable sources for Incremental 4 water to deliver to the refuges well into this uncertain future. The North Valley Regional Recycled Water Program will make treated, recycled water from the Cities of [[Turlock]] and [[Modesto, California|Modesto]] available for re-use at the Refuges. The RWSP took an active role in this pioneering program's development and in return, in 2016, signed a 40-year contract for water deliveries from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nvr-recycledwater.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usbr.gov/mp/nepa/documentShow.cfm?Doc_ID=25647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Facility Construction ====
CVPIA Section 3406(d)(5) provides for facilities construction to benefit the mandate of supplying refuge water. This component funds projects that identify, construct and/or maintain infrastructure projects supporting the long-term delivery of firm, reliable water supplies to the boundary of the Refuges. The RWSP's goal is to have the necessary facilities in place allowing for the delivery of Full L4 water supplies to the Refuges that meet their timing and scheduling requirements. A total of 46 new or modifications to major structures and/or actions were identified to provide needed capacity for the delivery of Full Level 4 surface supplies to these refuges.

==== Water Conveyance (Wheeling) ====
CVPIA Sections 3406(d)(1),(2) and (5) of the CVPIA describe the functions and responsibilities of the Refuge Water Conveyance (Wheeling) Component. The use of a water conveyance facility by someone other than the owner or operator to transport water is referred to as "wheeling." The conveyance component is responsible for ensuring the delivery of a refuge's level 2 and acquired water supplies through contracts and agreements that allow for these water supplies to move from source to refuge destination.

The reservoirs that hold water destined for a refuge are connected to the refuges by a network of channels, owned and operated by multiple entities. Similar to a network of roadways there are conveyance channels of many kinds (with names like: aqueduct, canal, slough and ditch) and sizes. Some channels are free to use by the RWSP, like rivers, and some require payment, such as those built and maintained by a water district.  The RWSP negotiated contracts coordinating the delivery of water.  Reclamation currently has nine long-term (15–50 years) conveyance agreements that are administered by the RWSP, one Service 40-year conveyance agreement, cooperative agreements to reimburse delivering entities for costs of conveying L2 and IL4 water supplies through federal, state, and private water distribution systems to the refuges and agreements to reimburse costs for groundwater pumping in instances where groundwater is pumped at the refuge itself. Deliveries are monitored throughout the system as water enters and exits metered channels.

Water that is transferred any distance suffers what are termed 'conveyance losses' which means that the amount of water released at the start is not the same amount that ultimately arrives. The difference between what is sent versus what is received are conveyance losses and can be the result of evaporation or seepage (soaking into the land). In some cases water travels over 300 miles to reach its final refuge destination.

== Accomplishments and Benefits to Nature ==
The CVPIA was enacted to increase the population and improve the health of the Central Valley's anadromous fish and increase the acreage and health of wetlands used by migratory birds and other resident wildlife both of which suffered as a result of the construction of the CVP. The RWSP focuses on the health of wetlands by acquiring and conveying necessary water supplies. Since CVPIA was enacted numerous biological benefits have resulted from supplying the Refuges with a reliable year-round water supply that adequately meets the refuge-specific water delivery schedules developed for individual wetland management requirements. Prior to CVPIA, refuge managers had to concentrate the majority of their water use in the fall and early winter months, when Central Valley waterfowl numbers peaked. With the passage of CVPIA, the habitat calendar was expanded to the full year. These increased and reliable supplies of water enable managers to enhance existing habitats, expand their wetland base, and provide increased benefits to a greater number of wetland-dependent species.

=== Habitat and Biodiversity ===
Refuge activities are water dependent. Having a firm and adequate supply of water available when most beneficial throughout the year enables managers to implement improved management techniques and allows them to better manage lands and activities. This increased efficiency and reliability has both increased wetland acreage and improved wetland health by affording refuge managers with the ability to manage a diverse mix of habitat types that more fully satisfied year-round environmental requirements of many wildlife species.

==== Benefits of Water Reliability ====
Before the CVPIA, refuge managers concentrated the majority of water use in fall and early winter months (October - December), when Central Valley waterfowl numbers peaked. With the passage of CVPIA, the habitat calendar was expanded to the full year, allowing refuge managers' the ability to provide habitat to an extended group of migratory birds as well as other wildlife and grow plant materials that provide a food supply or habitat for food sources. Under CVPIA programs, moist soil food plant irrigations are carried out since water is reliably available during August and September to satisfy the needs of the early arriving migrant waterfowl and shorebirds, maintenance flows are applied throughout the winter months to improve water quality and decrease avian disease outbreaks, and during spring and summer, when wetland habitat can be particularly limited by hydrology, water provides critical nesting habitat for waterfowl and colonial birds as well as habitat for resident wildlife and their young. Wintering wildlife also benefit from this habitat diversity, as seasonal wetlands are now managed to coincide with peak migration times of shorebirds and waterfowl.

With the increased frequency and acreage of irrigated moist soil food plants there has been a doubling in desirable plant biomass, which equates to more high-quality, high energy food available to waterfowl. In some refuges waterfowl food production has increased tenfold. Timely de-watering and irrigation promote the germination and irrigation of important moist-soil food plants, such as swamp timothy and watergrass. These plants provide a high-energy food source through both their seeds and associated invertebrate communities. The increase in supply reliability allows wetland managers to lower water depths to make seeds and invertebrates available without the fear of having wetlands completely evaporate.

==== Benefits of Increased Wetland Acreage ====
Waterfowl, shorebirds and other wetland-dependent wildlife have benefited as their habitats have been expanded and enhanced. Central Valley wetlands receiving CVP water supplies have increased by more than 20,000 acres since the passage of the CVPIA while tens of thousands of acres of habitat have been enhanced. This wetland acreage helps explain the 75% decrease in waterfowl disease-related mortality in some wetland areas as the birds spread out over a greater area.

==== Benefits of Improved Water Quality ====
At least as important as the increase in acreage, improvement in the quality of previously existing wetlands that has resulted from the delivery of suitable water. Increasing water supplies to wetlands also has the effect of improving water quality, both on and off refuges. For example, providing firm, quality water supplies has reduced the exposure of waterfowl and shore birds spending the winter in the Grasslands area of the valley to contaminents. In a report on selenium in aquatic birds from the Central Valley, 1986-1994, FWS scientists noted that application of freshwater resulted in the decline of selenium contamination. Improved maintenance water flows through refuge ponds to improve water quality and reduce avian disease. The ability to battle avian disease outbreaks, such as botulism and cholera, is greatly assisted by applying additional water and creating a "flow through" system of water delivery and drainage. This "flow through" also helps deal with wetland areas high in salinity, which are often lower in productivity and diversity. CVPIA water allows wetland managers to "flush" salts from wetland basins and improve soil quality.

=== Migratory Waterfowl ===
Since the passage of the CVPIA, Sacramento Valley areas receiving CVP water have seen a 20% increase in waterfowl use and a significant decline in water-borne wildlife diseases. Waterfowl use in the early fall have recorded increases of 800 percent, from 2 million to over 18 million waterfowl use days per year.

White-faced ibis and sandhill cranes are excellent examples of how the availability of adequate water supplies enabled refuge managers to provide habitat for endemic species that had been in severe decline for decades. Improved water supplies first led to an increase in the numbers of frogs, snails, aquatic insects, and small fish. This, in turn, provided the ibis and cranes with habitat for late-spring and summer nesting, essential components for these species. The increased and improved breeding habitat resulted in a steady upswing in bird numbers.

=== Other Wildlife ===
Wetlands are diverse ecosystems. The increased wetland acreage and improved water quality has benefited more than bird populations. Improved water supplies led to an increase in the numbers of frogs, snails, aquatic insects, and small fish. Habitat that is now available during the months of August and early September is utilized by resident wildlife and their young during a critical time of the year when wetland habitat is otherwise reduced. Introducing water for semi-permanent and permanent wetland habitat in the spring and summer directly benefits the recovery of special status species such as the giant garter snake and tri-colored blackbirds.

== Budget ==
The CVPIA is a federal program and receives funding every year through Congressional appropriation.  It would require between $50 - $60 Million annually to achieve the goals of the RWSP. The most recent budget (FY 2017) provided approximately $22 Million.

The '''Renunciation Act of 1944''' (Public Law 78-405, {{USStat|58|677}}) was an act of the [[78th United States Congress|78th Congress]] regarding the [[renunciation of United States citizenship]]. Prior to the law's passage, it was not possible to lose U.S. citizenship while in U.S. territory except by conviction for treason; the Renunciation Act allowed people physically present in the U.S. to renounce citizenship when the country was in a state of war by making an application to the [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]]. The intention of the 1944 Act was to encourage [[Japanese American internment|Japanese American internees]] to renounce citizenship so that they could be deported to [[Japan]].

After the end of [[World War II]], those who wanted their [[Citizenship of the United States|U.S. citizenship]] restored were generally successful at arguing before federal courts that their renunciations pursuant to the 1944 Act had been made under duress and were therefore invalid. The law remained in effect but received little further attention until the 2000s, when a prisoner interested in renouncing U.S. citizenship won a ruling from a federal court that the U.S. was indeed in a "state of war" at the time for purposes of the 1944 Act. Other prisoners sought to renounce citizenship under the 1944 Act but could not fulfill an administrative requirement that they appear in person at a [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] office for an interview — a requirement whose legality was upheld twice by federal courts — or that they depart from the United States immediately after having their renunciation application approved. A [[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013|2013 immigration reform bill]] contained provisions to repeal the 1944 Act.

The Renunciation Act of 1944 has no official [[short title]]; its [[long title]] was "A bill to provide for the loss of United States nationality under certain circumstances".&lt;ref name="CREC19440201"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/congressionalrec90aunit#page/n517/mode/1up|chapter=Public bills and resolutions|title=Congressional Record|date=1944-02-01|accessdate=2013-07-03|page=H1035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another unofficial name for it is the Denationalization Act of 1944.&lt;ref name="Daniels"/&gt; It is also officially referred to as the Act of July 1, 1944,&lt;ref name="INSInterpretation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-45077/0-0-0-52328.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216054436/http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-45077/0-0-0-52328.html|title=Interpretation 349.7 Expatriation by formal renunciation of United States citizenship|publisher=[[Immigration and Naturalization Service]]|archivedate=2010-02-16|accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; a name it shares with the [[Public Health Service Act]]. It added the following item to the list of actions in [[Nationality Act of 1940]] § 401 ({{USCSub|8|801}}) which would result in loss of nationality by a United States citizen or [[United States national|non-citizen national]]:

:making in the United States a formal written renunciation of nationality in such form as may be prescribed by, and before such officer as may be designated by, the Attorney General, whenever the United States shall be in a state of war and the Attorney General shall approve such renunciation as not contrary to the interests of national defense.

Due to immigration law reforms and the removal of other items from the list of actions causing loss of nationality, the exact subsection number of this provision has changed over the years. It appeared in the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] at § 349(a)(7).&lt;ref name="INSInterpretation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|66|268}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] did not alter § 349 at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|79|911}} et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; It currently stands at INA § 349(a)(6) ({{USCSub|8|1481|a|6}}).&lt;ref name="Kennedy2006"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jpri.org/publications/workingpapers/wp110.html|first=Ellen Clare|last=Kennedy|title=The Japanese-American Renunciants: Due Process and the Danger of Making Laws During Times of Fear|journal=JPRI Working Papers|issue=110|date=October 2006|accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Nationality Act of 1940 as it stood originally, renunciation of citizenship could only be performed before a United States diplomatic officer overseas. In December 1943, [[Martin Dies, Jr.]] (D-TX) asked Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]] to appear before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] to testify on the handling of internees seeking to depart from the United States for Japan; Biddle recommended amending the 1940 Act to permit loss of nationality by persons on U.S. soil.&lt;ref name="BarnhartMatson"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6il2D3OdrMC&amp;pg=PA174|first=Edward Norton|last=Barnhart|first2=Floyd W.|last2=Matson|chapter=Chapter 3: History of the Evacuation|title=Prejudice, War, and the Constitution|publisher=University of California Press|year=1954|isbn=9780520012622|pages=174–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biddle and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] drafted a bill to that effect and were significantly involved in efforts to lobby Congress for support. [[Edward Ennis]] of the Department of Justice estimated that between one and three thousand Japanese Americans would renounce citizenship under the law's provisions. Ennis saw the bill as crucial to the DOJ's efforts to retain custody of Japanese Americans suspected of disloyalty; he feared that the courts would find continued internment of U.S. citizens to be unconstitutional, and hoped that "militants" among Japanese American internees would voluntarily renounce citizenship under the bill's provisions, in which case the DOJ could continue to detain them until they could be deported to Japan.&lt;ref name="Daniels"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eiQE317r3mgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA165|first=Roger|last=Daniels|title=Asian America: Chinese and Japanese in the United States Since 1850|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1988|isbn=9780295801186|pages=265–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. Leonard Allen]] (D-LA) introduced the bill on February 1, 1944.&lt;ref name="CREC19440201"/&gt; It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization|House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization]], which unanimously reported the bill two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/congressionalrec90aunit#page/n616/mode/1up|chapter=Reports of committees on public bills and resolutions|title=Congressional Record|date=1944-02-03|accessdate=2013-07-03|page=H1233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen first spoke about the bill on the House floor on February 8; he described it as "a bill to expatriate certain Japanese nationals ... who have openly avowed their disloyalty to the United States and have disclaimed loyalty to the United States, although they were born in this country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/congressionalrec90aunit#page/n719/mode/1up|chapter=Extension of remarks|title=Congressional Record|date=1944-02-08|accessdate=2013-07-03|pages=H1439–1441}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was further debate on the bill on February 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/congressionalrec90aunit#page/n891/mode/1up|title=Providing for loss of United States nationality under certain circumstances|work=Congressional Record|date=1944-02-16|accessdate=2013-07-03|pages=H1778–1789}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] representatives criticized it as insufficiently far-reaching for its failure to consider alleged renunciations of citizenship prior to the bill's enactment. [[J. Leroy Johnson]] (R-CA) thus moved an amendment to the bill to allow the Attorney General to consider all statements of renunciation of citizenship as far back as October 1940. In support, [[Clair Engle]] (D-CA) pointed to the refusal of 5,376 internees to "swear unqualified allegiance to the United States and renounce Japan" as an example of the type of alleged renunciations of citizenship which the original bill failed to consider, while [[Bertrand W. Gearhart]] (R-CA) noted that many internees who had earlier expressed enthusiasm for Japan were less vocal due to the defeats the country had suffered in battle and urged that their statements not go unpunished.&lt;ref name="SanJoseEveningNews"/&gt; The previous week, Gearhart had also introduced a bill which would strip Japanese Americans of citizenship unless they swore an oath of allegiance to the United States in a court of naturalization within 60&amp;nbsp;days after the date of his bill's passage rejecting the divinity of the [[Emperor of Japan]] and the "divine mission" of the "[[Yamato race]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_FpQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ng4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6870,2254512|title=Bill puts U.S. Japs on spot|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=1944-02-07|accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that "I am convinced that the method I propose, constitutional in all of its aspects, will reveal a large number of Japanese who are earnestly hoping for our defeat, secretly doing everything they can to insure a victory for our despicable foes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pSlWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=deQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4347,1725197|title=House bill hits disloyal Japs|work=The Spokesman-Herald|date=1944-02-07|accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Samuel Dickstein (congressman)|Samuel Dickstein]] (D-NY), chairman of the House immigration committee, opposed Johnson's amendment, stating that Congress had no authority to revoke the citizenship of birthright citizens.&lt;ref name="SanJoseEveningNews"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ux1KAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TiANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1518,3579879|title=Bill would take away citizenship|work=San Jose Evening News|date=1944-02-16|accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earl C. Michener]] (R-MI) warned of the potential for abuse, saying that "if the amendment were adopted, it would mean that anybody who at any time said anything which might be construed as unpatriotic could be brought in." Bill sponsor [[A. Leonard Allen]] (D-LA) and [[Richard F. Harless]] (D-AZ) also spoke out against the amendment, sympathizing with the motivations of the amendment's proponents while stating that it was probably unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3ghQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FVUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3903,5871185|title=Group Would Block Backsliding Japs|work=The Evening Independent|date=1944-02-17|accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Johnson's amendment was defeated by a narrow margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4kolAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j-MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2559,1490684|title=Capital Report|work=Berkeley Daily Gazette|date=1944-07-21|accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill itself in its original form passed the House on February 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/congressionalrec90aunit#page/n992/mode/1up|title=Loss of United States nationality under certain circumstances|work=Congressional Record|date=1944-02-23|accessdate=2013-07-03|pages=H1981–1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate Committee on Immigration reported the bill without amendment on June 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/congressionalrec90cunit#page/n318/mode/1up|chapter=Reports of committees|work=Congressional Record|date=1944-06-22|accessdate=2013-07-04|page=S6459}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rufus C. Holman]] (R-OR) initially objected, suggesting that the bill should be amended to insert the word "voluntarily", but [[Wallace H. White, Jr.]] (R-ME) pointed out to him that the Nationality Act of 1940 already required that any action specified as causing loss of nationality would only have that effect if it were undertaken voluntarily, and Holman withdrew his objection. White brought the bill up for consideration on June 23, stating that "[t]he reason I have asked to have the bill considered at this time is that we are hopeful that a number of Japanese will take advantage of the procedure outlined in the bill so that we may offer them to the Imperial Government of Japan in exchange for American citizens who are now being held", and the bill passed that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/congressionalrec90cunit#page/n396/mode/1up|title=Renunciation of American citizenship by certain citizens of Japanese ancestry|work=Congressional Record|date=1944-06-23|accessdate=2013-07-03|pages=S6616–6617}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the bill passed the Senate, President [[Franklin D.

==World War II renunciations==
[[File:Tule Lake Relocation Center, Newell, California. A view in the lunch shed at the farm. Trucks from . . . - NARA - 538339.tif|thumb|right|The vast majority of renunciants came from the [[Tule Lake]] internment camp ''(pictured)''.]]

Biddle and the Department of Justice began implementing procedures under the Act in October 1944. Each internee seeking to renounce citizenship would have to fill out a standard application form identifying him or herself and signing a statement that "I fully understand that if permitted to renounce my United States nationality I will divest myself of all rights and privileges thereunto pertaining". This application would be followed by an administrative hearing to determine whether or not Biddle should grant approval in his capacity as Attorney General. Each renunciant whose application was successful would receive a "Notice of Approval of Renunciation" as proof.&lt;ref name="BarnhartMatson"/&gt;

Many renunciants would later face stigmatization in the Japanese American community, during and after the war, for having made that choice, although at the time they were not certain what their futures held were they to remain American and remain interned. These renunciations of American citizenship have been highly controversial, for a number of reasons. Some apologists for internment have cited the renunciations as evidence that "disloyalty" or [[anti-Americanism]] was well represented among the interned peoples, thereby justifying the internment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malkin|first=Michelle|title=In Defense of Internment; The Case for 'Racial Profiling' in World War II and the War on Terror|date=2004|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians have dismissed the latter argument, for its failure to consider that the small number of individuals in question were in the midst of persecution by their own government at the time of the "renunciation":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ng|first=Wendy L.|title=Japanese American Internment During World War II|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date=2002|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YmXeGYlOXu4C&amp;pg=PA61 61]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="niiya293"&gt;{{cite book|last=Niiya|first=Brian|title=Japanese American History: An A-to-Z Reference from 1868 to the Present|publisher=Japanese American National Museum|date=1993|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C&amp;pg=PA293 293]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he renunciations had little to do with "loyalty" or "disloyalty" to the United States, but were instead the result of a series of complex conditions and factors that were beyond the control of those involved. Prior to discarding citizenship, most or all of the renunciants had experienced the following misfortunes: forced removal from homes; loss of jobs; government and public assumption of disloyalty to the land of their birth based on race alone; and incarceration in a "segregation center" for "disloyal" ISSEI or NISEI...&lt;ref name="niiya293" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Minoru Kiyota, who was among those who renounced his citizenship and swiftly came to regret the decision, has stated that he wanted only "to express my fury toward the government of the United States," for his internment and for the mental and physical duress, as well as the intimidation, he was made to face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ngai|first=Mae M.|title=Impossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=2004|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=X1dzAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192 192]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[M]y renunciation had been an expression of momentary emotional defiance in reaction to years of persecution suffered by myself and other Japanese Americans and, in particular, to the degrading interrogation by the FBI agent at [[Topaz War Relocation Center|Topaz]] and being terrorized by the guards and gangs at [[Tule Lake War Relocation Center|Tule Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kiyota|first=Minoru|last2=Keenan|first2=Linda Klepinger|title=Beyond Loyalty: The Story of a Kibei|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|date=1997|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=I8wfFPtRskgC&amp;pg=PA129 129]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

San Francisco attorney [[Wayne M. Collins]] helped many people who had renounced citizenship under the provisions of the 1944 Act to have the government's recognition of their renunciations reversed.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2006"/&gt; On [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in 1967, the Department of Justice promulgated regulations which would make it unnecessary for renunciants to resort to the courts; they could instead fill out a standard form to request an administrative determination of the validity of their earlier renunciations.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCFR|8|349|1}}, "Japanese renunciation of nationality".&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all renunciants sought to regain their citizenship; [[Joseph Kurihara]], for example, chose instead to accept repatriation to Japan, and lived out the rest of his life there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Eileen H.|last=Tamura|title=In Defense of Justice: Joseph Kurihara and the Japanese American Struggle for Equality|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later case law==

===Definition of "state of war"===
Later case law on the Renunciation Act of 1944 focused on the meaning of the term "state of war". Congress passed a [[joint resolution]] that July 25, 1947 "shall be deemed to be the date of the termination of any state of war heretofore declared by the Congress and of the national emergencies proclaimed by the President on September 8, 1939, and on May 27, 1941" in the interpretation of a large number of statutes, including the Renunciation Act of 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|80|S.J.Res|123}}; Public Law 80-219; {{USStat|61|449}} et seq. The Renunciation Act of 1944 is specifically listed in Section 3 of the joint resolution, at {{USStat|61|454}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive branch interpreted "state of war" to exclude the [[Vietnam War]]. The [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] wrote that "It has also been determined that, for purposes of current section 349(a)(7), the United States has not been in a state war during the period of the Viet Nam hostilities, and is not now in a state of war by reason of that conflict. Accordingly, any attempt to renounce citizenship within the United States under the current provision, based upon the Viet Nam conflict, should be regarded as ineffectual."&lt;ref name="INSInterpretation"/&gt; In an ''[[obiter dictum]]'' in a 1970 [[Board of Immigration Appeals]] decision on the deportation case against [[Thomas Jolley]], a North Carolina man who renounced U.S. citizenship in Toronto but later returned to the United States, Anthony Montaquila noted that "[t]he Immigration and Naturalization Service receives communications from persons in the United States imprisoned for crime who wish to renounce their citizenship, and those who wish to avoid military service. ... However, there are no procedures in the present laws as was the case involving Japanese renunciants during World War II."&lt;ref name="A18168808"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/intdec/vol13/2039.pdf|title=Matter of Jolley In Deportation Proceedings A-18168808|publisher=United States Department of Justice|date=1970-03-19|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, James Kaufman, a [[Wisconsin]] prisoner, attempted to use the Renunciation Act of 1944 to renounce his U.S. citizenship. When his application was ignored, he filed a ''[[pro se]]'' suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]], which ruled against him. Kaufman's legal battles would go on for several years, and in 2008 he made another attempt to renounce his citizenship under the same law. He appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]], where Judges [[Judith W. Rogers]], [[A. Raymond Randolph]] and [[Harry T. Edwards]] remanded Kaufman's case to the District Court for another hearing, writing that "we do not understand the government to suggest that a congressionally created right can be nullified by government inaction". In 2010, Judge [[Richard W. Roberts]] ruled that the U.S. was indeed in a state of war in both 2004 and 2008, rejecting assertions by the Department of Justice that the law was ambiguous and that the DOJ should be permitted to interpret the term "state of war" as it saw fit in administering the statute. The DOJ appealed Roberts' ruling to the D.C. Circuit Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202457435187&amp;DOJ_Challenges_Sex_Offenders_Effort_to_Renounce_Citizenship&amp;slreturn=20130530112536|first=Mike|last=Scarcella|title=DOJ Challenges Sex Offender's Effort to Renounce Citizenship|work=The National Law Journal|date=2010-04-30|accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, attorneys for the Department of Justice abandoned the appeal in August 2010, while declining to make public comment on their reasons for that decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202470006780&amp;slreturn=20130530112538|first=Mike|last=Scarcella|title=DOJ Abandons Challenge of Sex Offender's Desire to Renounce Citizenship|work=The National Law Journal|date=2010-08-18|accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requirement to renounce in person===
In various instances in 2011, other U.S. citizens serving prison sentences enquired with [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) about renouncing their U.S. citizenship under the Renunciation Act of 1944. USCIS responded that they would have to appear in person at a designated USCIS office for an interview, a requirement which they could not fulfill due to their imprisonment, and that until the interview USCIS would hold their applications in abeyance.&lt;ref name="DUSPIL2012"&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/211872.pdf|chapter=Chapter 1: Nationality, Citizenship, and Immigration|title=Digest of United States Practice in International Law|publisher=Department of State|location=Washington, D.C.|year=2012|pages=22–25|accessdate=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two filed separate suits in the District Court for the District of Columbia.

====''Sluss v. USCIS''====
One ''pro se'' case, ''Sluss v. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services'', came before Judge [[Ellen Segal Huvelle]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2012cv00417/153335/19|title=SLUSS v. UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES et al|publisher=Justia.com|date=2012-10-20|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaintiff Matthew David Sluss argued that the requirement to appear at a USCIS office in person violated the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] (APA) because that requirement did not appear anywhere in the text of the Renunciation Act of 1944. Huvelle disagreed, writing in her memorandum opinion that "the statute requires the agency to assess the voluntariness of an applicant’s renouncement without stating how such an assessment should occur", and thus found that no APA violation had occurred.&lt;ref name="DUSPIL2012"/&gt;

====''Schnitzler v. United States''====
In another case, ''Schnitzler v. United States'', plaintiff Aaron Schnitzler first appeared ''pro se'', but later gained representation. In the initial District Court case, Judge [[Reggie Walton]] construed Schnitzler's filing as a motion for a [[writ of mandamus]] against USCIS compelling them to process his application for renunciation, as well as a declaration that the Renunciation Act of 1944 was unconstitutional. Walton declined to grant relief, writing in his [[memorandum opinion]] that Schnitzler lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute and that USCIS had already acted on his application; with regards to Schnitzler's right to renounce his citizenship, Walton quoted the Supreme Court case ''Hewitt v. Helms'', where it was stated that "[l]awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dc.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.20120525_0000495.DDC.htm/qx|title=Aaron L. Schnitzler A.K.A. Tyson Q. Becht v. United States of America et al|publisher=FindACase.com|date=2012-05-25|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.justice.gov/civil/docs_forms/ImmigrationBulletin/May_2012.pdf|title=This Month's Topical Parentheticals|work=Immigration Litigation Bulletin|volume=16|number=5|date=May 2012|accessdate=2014-07-13|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Represented by students in [[Georgetown University Law Center]]'s Appellate Litigation Program, in 2014 Schnitzler challenged Walton's decision in the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, before Chief Judge [[Merrick B. Garland]] and Circuit Judges [[Robert L. Wilkins]] and [[Douglas H. Ginsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/DB41AEB1927849CF85257D2E004E3FC8/$file/12-5200-1506785.pdf |title=''Schnitzler v. United States'', No. 12-5200 |publisher=Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit |date=2014-08-08 |accessdate=2015-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403142443/http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/DB41AEB1927849CF85257D2E004E3FC8/$file/12-5200-1506785.pdf |archivedate=April 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling first disagreed that Schnitzler lacked standing to challenge the renunciation statutes, stating that as he remained a citizen against his wishes, he had grounds to seek redress against what he viewed as an injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/08/08/235860/appeals-court-allows-inmate-to.html|first=Michael|last=Doyle|title=Appeals court allows inmate to try to renounce U.S. citizenship|work=McClatchy|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling further criticized the lower court for construing Schnitzler's filings as a motion for a writ of mandamus and concluding that USCIS' response meant he had obtained the relief he sought, and for stating that Schnitzler had no standing to challenge USCIS' policy either. Garland noted that the government "offered a blizzard of constantly changing explanations for why it could not process [Schnitzler]'s request", and in the end USCIS did not actually inform Schnitzler of the in-person interview policy before he filed his initial challenge in the District Court (a letter informing Schnitlzer of the policy did not get mailed out). Schnitzler's case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/dc_circuit/2014/08/sd-prisoner-can-try-to-renounce-citizenship-from-behind-bars.html|first=Mark|last=Wilson|title=S.D.

===Requirement to depart from the United States after renunciation===
In a separate instance in 2012, Alan Horowitz, a dual citizen of the United States and Israel, also inquired with USCIS about renouncing U.S. citizenship under the Renunciation Act of 1944. USCIS responded that he must attend an interview at a USCIS office and demonstrate that he met all of the legal requirements to renounce his citizenship, in particular that he had the "ability and intention to depart the [United States] immediately upon having [his] renunciation request granted." Horowitz had just been released from a New York state prison, but the [[New York Attorney General]] directed, pursuant to the state's Mental Hygiene Law, that Horowitz either remain in custody of the [[New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision|Department of Corrections and Community Supervision]] (DOCCS) pending further proceedings or be committed to a custodial treatment facility. The [[New York Supreme Court]] granted Horowitz' motion for an order directing DOCCS to produce him at a USCIS office for the in-person interview. However, he failed to actually secure the right to depart from the United States: the court rejected his argument that differing treatment of alien and dual-citizen offenders — in particular, the fact that an alien in his circumstances would be deported after completion of sentence, whereas citizens faced barriers to leaving — violated his right to [[equal protection]] and [[substantive due process]]. Horowitz appealed, but in 2014 the [[New York Court of Appeals]] affirmed the lower court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/appellate-division-third-department/2014/517502.html|title=Matter of State of New York v Horowitz|publisher=Justia.com|date=2014-07-03|accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/this-weeks-news/id=1202662402396/Panel-Denies-Sex-Offenders-Citizenship-Renouncement?mcode=1202615038803&amp;curindex=9&amp;slreturn=20140609044257|first=Joel|last=Stashenko|title=Panel Denies Sex Offender's Citizenship Renouncement|work=New York Law Journal|date=2014-07-09|accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed repeal==
Section 3713 of the [[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013]] would repeal {{USCSub|8|1481|a|6}}, under the rubric of "preventing criminals from renouncing citizenship during wartime". This provision was contained in the initial version of the bill sponsored by the [[Gang of Eight (immigration)|Gang of Eight]], and remained in the version that passed the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on June 27, 2013.&lt;ref name="THOMAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:s744:|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status, 113th Congress (2013 - 2014): S.744|publisher=[[THOMAS]]|date=2013-06-27|accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same provision was also contained in the version of the bill introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] on October 2, 2013 by [[Joe Garcia]] and 180 co-sponsors.&lt;ref name="THOMAS-HOUSE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:h.r.00015:|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status, 113th Congress (2013 - 2014): H.R.15|publisher=[[THOMAS]]|date=2013-10-02|accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">'''Rocket Kitten''' or the '''Rocket Kitten Group''' is a [[hacker group]] thought to be linked to the [[Iran]]ian government.&lt;ref name="CP"/&gt; The threat actor group has targeted organizations and individuals in the Middle East, particularly Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran as well as the United States and Europe.

==Origins==
Cybersecurity firm [[FireEye]] first identified the group as '''Ajax Security Team''',&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt; writing that the group appears to have been formed in 2010 by the hacker personas "Cair3x" and "HUrr!c4nE!". By 2012, the threat actor group turned their focus to Iran's political opponents.&lt;ref name="FireEye" /&gt; Their targeted attack campaigns, dubbed "Rocket Kitten", have been known since mid-2014.&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt; By 2013 or 2014, Rocket Kitten had shifted its focus to malware-based cyberespionage.&lt;ref name="FireEye" /&gt;

Security firm [[Check Point]] describes Rocket Kitten as an "attacker group of Iranian origin."&lt;ref name="CP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rocket Kitten: A Campaign With 9 Lives|url=http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rocket-kitten-report.pdf|publisher=Check Point|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocket Kitten's code uses [[Persian language]] references. The group's targets are involved in defense, diplomacy, international affairs, security, policy research, human rights, and journalism. According to Check Point, the group has targeted Iranian dissidents, the [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]], Israeli nuclear scientists, and [[NATO]] officials. Security researchers found that they carried out a "common pattern of spearphishing campaigns reflecting the interests and activities of the Iranian security apparatus."&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt; Other researchers determined that Rocket Kitten's attacks bore a similarity to those attributed to Iran's [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]].&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt; Intelligence officials from the Middle East and Europe linked Rocket Kitten to the Iranian military establishment.&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt; Rocket Kitten favours a [[Remote Access Trojan]],&lt;ref name="SC" /&gt; and by 2015, researchers found it was using customised malware.&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt;

==History==
===Operation Saffron Rose===
Cybersecurity firm FireEye released a report in 2013 finding that Rocket Kitten had conducted several cyberespionage operations against United States [[defense industrial base]] companies. The report also detailed the targeting of Iranian citizens who use anti-censorship tools to bypass Iran's Internet filters.&lt;ref name="FireEye"&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Saffron Rose|url=https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-operation-saffron-rose.pdf|publisher=FireEye|accessdate=26 December 2016|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Woolen-Goldfish===
Trend Micro identified the Operation Woolen-Goldfish campaign in a March 2015 paper. The campaign included improved spearphishing content.&lt;ref name="CP"/&gt;

===Oyun===
In November 2015, security errors by Rocket Kitten allowed the firm Check Point to gain password-less root access to "Oyun", the hackers' back-end database. They discovered an application that  was able to generate personalized phishing pages and contained a list of over 1,842 individual targets.&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Infosec"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muncaster|first1=Phil|title=Opsec Blunders Expose Rocket Kitten Masterminds|url=http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/opsec-blunders-expose-rocket/|work=Infosecurity Magazine|date=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Rocket Kitten's spearphishing targets from June 2014 to June 2015, 18% were from Saudi Arabia, 17% were from the United States, 16% were from Iran, 8% were from the Netherlands, and 5% were from Israel.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Sam|title=Cyber warfare: Iran opens a new front|url=https://www.ft.com/content/15e1acf0-0a47-11e6-b0f1-61f222853ff3|work=Financial Times|date=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts used credentials to access [[Keystroke logging|key logs]] of the group's victims and found that Rocket Kitten had apparently tested their malware on their own workstations and failed to erase the logs from the data files.&lt;ref name="Infosec"/&gt; Check Point identified an individual named Yaser Balaghi, going by Wool3n.H4t, as a ringleader of the operation.&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carman|first1=Ashley|title=Supposed mastermind behind 'Rocket Kitten' APT identified in research paper|url=https://www.scmagazine.com/check-point-publishes-report-on-rocket-kitten-techniques/article/533439/|work=SC Magazine US|date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telegram hack===
In August 2016, researchers identified Rocket Kitten as being behind a hack of [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]], a cloud-based instant messaging service. The hackers exploited Telegram's reliance on SMS verification, comprising over a dozen accounts and stealing the user IDs and telephone numbers of 15 million Iranians who use the software. Opposition organizations and reformist political activists were among the victims.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Menn|first1=Joseph|last2=Torbati|first2=Yeganeh|title=Exclusive: Hackers accessed Telegram messaging accounts in Iran - researchers|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-cyber-telegram-exclusive-idUSKCN10D1AM|work=Reuters|date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, a '''salvage title''' is a form of [[vehicle title branding]], which notes that the [[vehicle]] has been damaged and/or deemed a [[total loss]] by an insurance company that paid a [[insurance claim|claim]] on it.  The criteria for determining when a salvage title is issued differ considerably by each state, province or territory. In a minority of states and Canadian provinces, regulations require a salvage title for stolen or vandalized vehicles which are not recovered by police within 21 days. In such cases insurance companies declare a vehicle total loss and pay off the previous owner;&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Keith|title=Understand Used Car Salvage Titles: Salvage Titles Not Always a Bad Proposition If You Act Carefully|url=http://usedcars.about.com/od/safetyratings/a/SalvageTitle.htm|work=About.com:  Used Cars|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, in others, it is issued only for losses due to damage.

==Determination of salvage status==
In general, a vehicle is deemed "salvage" when the insurer determines that the repair or replacement cost is in excess of approximately 70% of its [[market value]] at the time of the accident or theft.&lt;ref name=Griffin /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eversman /&gt;  Thresholds range between 50% and 95% of the vehicle's value, while "total loss states" leave the specifics to the insurer.  In the state of Michigan, the issuance of a salvage title does ''not'' mean that the vehicle is also deemed a total loss.&lt;ref name="Eversman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eversman|first=E.L.|title=The Purpose Behind Salvage Title Laws|url=https://www.vehicleinfo.com/articles.php?id=26|work=AutoMuse|publisher=Vehicle Information Systems, Inc.|accessdate=3 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009035944/https://www.vehicleinfo.com/articles.php?id=26|archivedate=9 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michigan issues a salvage title when the damage equals 75-90% of the pre-damage value; if the loss is 91% or greater the vehicle is eligible only for a "scrap" title, which cannot be subsequently upgraded by any means.

&lt;!--This paragraph is poorly written and subjective--&gt;
Many people {{who|date=July 2018}} are confused about the actual repair cost that insurance companies use to deem the vehicle a salvage title. Skeptical shoppers automatically assume that 50-70% repair to value ratio of a vehicle would suggest that the vehicle is completely totaled and beyond reasonable repair. This is not always true and the shoppers who understand this are the ones who can obtain very good bargains. Although it is true that salvage titles are typically issued to vehicles when the repair costs exceed 50-70% of the vehicle value, this percentage needs to be considered in detail before assumptions are made.

Upon paying the claim, the insurer may offer to return the vehicle to the owner as an insurance buy-back, in which case the owner is responsible for having the repairs made and having the car inspected by a State-designated facility.  Depending on the state, this inspection may remove the salvage brand from the vehicle's title.&lt;ref name=Ets-Hokin /&gt;  The exact percentage of value that triggers the decision to total the vehicle is guided by applicable laws and regulations.  The damage estimate is calculated at retail repair rates, which may be more than the cost of wholesale repair.  Vehicles that are not bought back are auctioned as salvage to an auto recycler or a rebuilder and given a salvage title.

==Resale value with a salvage title==

In the US, motorcycles and cars which carry a salvage title may not be registered and driven on public roads in most states,&lt;ref name="Ets-Hokin 2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ets-Hokin|first=Gabe|title=Buying a Motorcycle Part IV: Where It Comes From A Day at a Wholesale Dealer's Auction|url=http://www.motorcycle.com/how-to/buying-a-motorcycle-part-iv-where-it-comes-from-3428.html|work=Motorcycle.com|publisher=Verticalscope Inc.|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which impacts resale value.&lt;ref name="Ets-Hokin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ets-Hokin|first=Gabe|title=Buying a Motorcycle for the Compulsive or Impulsive- Part II|url=http://www.motorcycle.com/how-to/buying-a-motorcycle-for-the-compulsive-or-impulsive-part-ii-3425.html|work=Motorcycle.com|publisher=Verticalscope Inc.|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rebranding of the title is not permitted without having an inspection to verify that they meet all safety standards.&lt;ref name="CR 1999"&gt;{{cite book|title=Congressional Record:  Proceedings and Debates of the 106th Congress, First Session|year=1999|publisher=United States Printing Office|pages=4808|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eiS9sOjyL8MC&amp;pg=PA4808&amp;dq=%22salvage+title%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OLSHTIy5I8HflgfGhJXoDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22salvage%20title%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inspection procedure may be complex,&lt;ref name=Parks /&gt; and attempts to illegally circumvent the inspections are periodically reported.&lt;ref name="Futty"&gt;{{cite web|last=Futty|first=John|title=Ex-clerk gets 4 years in vehicle-title fraud|url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2010/09/08/ex-clerk-gets-4-years-in-vehicle-title-fraud.html?sid=101|work=The Columbus Dispatch|accessdate=8 September 2010|date=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry standards followed by the [[National Automobile Dealers Association]] Appraisal Guides, [[Kelley Blue Book]] Market Report Official Guide, and the International Society of Automotive Appraisers devalue a motor vehicle that has a salvage title.  The Kelley Blue Book automatically rates any salvage vehicle as "poor" and does not value it at all.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Thomas|first2=Cynthia |last2=Benzing |title=The Determinants of Price in Internet Auctions of Used Cars|journal=Atlanta Economic Journal|volume=35|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s11293-006-9045-7|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/16006124631934l7/|accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of a vehicle with a salvage title is generally 65-75% lower than the vehicle's estimated value.

If the vehicle is rebuilt to a road worthy condition and has passed State inspection, the difference in price is 60-70% of fair KBB. These cars have "rebuild" or "rebuild salvage" annotation in the title and can be registered and operated just like a new car.

Cars that previously had "junk" title and were restored to road worthy condition get a new title and VIN after state inspection. The new VIN will not match any other VIN numbers on the vehicle doors or panels. Year of the vehicle is determined by title issue date. These are considered to be self assembled cars.

''Title washing'' refers to transferring a vehicle's registration for the express purpose of removing a title brand.&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Philip|title=Vehicle History Report: Your Key to a Good Used Car|url=http://www.edmunds.com/advice/buying/articles/48118/article.html|work=Edmunds.com|publisher=Edmunds Inc.|accessdate=8 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803164131/http://www.edmunds.com/advice/buying/articles/48118/article.html|archivedate=3 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice is legal, and practiced by the insurance companies themselves.&lt;ref name="BSB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wawanesa Insurance Found Liable for Bad Faith|url=http://www.bodyshopbusiness.com/Article/78789/wawanesa_insurance_found_liable_for_bad_faith.aspx|work=Body Shop Business|publisher=Babcox Publications|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Title brands such as "salvage," "junk," and "rebuilt" are not standardized, and a vehicle which has such a designation may receive a clean title when registered in a different jurisdiction.  Further, vehicles imported to or exported from the United States and Canada are issued a clean title, even if they have been involved in an accident.  Other states have relatively lax inspection criteria to remove the salvage brand.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

[[File:Messenoire.jpg|Engraving by Henry de Malvost in the book ''Le Satanisme et la Magie'' by [[Jules Bois]] depicting a [[Black Mass]]|thumb |325px]]

'''Satanic ritual abuse''' ('''SRA''', sometimes known as '''ritual abuse''', '''ritualistic abuse''', '''organised abuse''', '''sadistic ritual abuse''', and other variants) was the subject of a [[moral panic]] (often referred to as the '''satanic panic''') that originated in the [[United States]] in the 1980s, spreading throughout many parts of the world by the late 1990s. Allegations of SRA involved reports of [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]] of people in the context of [[occult]] or [[Theistic Satanism|Satanic]] rituals. In its most extreme form, allegations involve a conspiracy of a worldwide SRA organisation that includes the wealthy and powerful of the world elite in which children are abducted or bred for sacrifices, [[child pornography|pornography]] and [[prostitution]].

Nearly every aspect of SRA was controversial, including its definition, the source of the allegations and proof thereof, testimonies of alleged victims, and court cases involving the allegations and criminal investigations. The panic affected lawyers', therapists', and social workers' handling of allegations of [[child sexual abuse]]. Allegations initially brought together widely dissimilar groups, including religious fundamentalists, police investigators, child advocates, therapists, and clients in [[psychotherapy]]. The movement gradually secularized, dropping or deprecating the "satanic" aspects of the allegations in favor of names that were less overtly religious such as "sadistic" or simply "ritual abuse" and becoming more associated with [[dissociative identity disorder]] and anti-government [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].

Initial publicity came via the book ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' (1980), and was sustained and popularized throughout the decade by the [[McMartin preschool trial]]. Testimonials, symptom lists, rumors, and techniques to investigate or uncover memories of SRA were disseminated through professional, popular, and religious conferences, as well as through the attention of [[talk show]]s, sustaining and further spreading the moral panic throughout the United States and beyond. In some cases, allegations resulted in criminal trials with varying results; after seven years in court, the McMartin trial resulted in no convictions for any of the accused, while other cases resulted in lengthy sentences, some of which were later reversed. Scholarly interest in the topic slowly built, eventually resulting in the conclusion that the phenomenon was a moral panic, which, as Sarah Hughes observed in 2017, "involved hundreds of accusations that devil-worshipping paedophiles were operating America's white middle-class suburban daycare centers."&lt;ref&gt;BERNIER, C., SEWELL, B., MOYNIHAN, S., &amp; WITHAM, N. (2017). Editors' Note. Journal of American Studies, 51(3), V-Vii. doi:10.1017/S0021875817000858&lt;/ref&gt;

Official investigations produced no evidence of widespread conspiracies or of the slaughter of thousands; only a small number of verified crimes have even remote similarities to tales of SRA.&lt;ref name="Goleman1994"/&gt; In the latter half of the 1990s, interest in SRA declined and skepticism became the default position, with very few researchers giving any credence to the existence of SRA.

The underpinnings for the contemporary moral panic were found in a rise of five factors in the years leading up to the 1980s: the establishment of [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christianity]] and political organization of the [[Moral Majority]]; the rise of the [[anti-cult movement]] which spread ideas of abusive [[cult]]s kidnapping and [[brainwashing]] children and teens; the appearance of the [[Church of Satan]] and other explicitly [[Satanist]] groups that added a kernel of truth to the existence of Satanic cults; the development of the [[social work]] or child protection field, and its struggle to have [[child sexual abuse]] recognized as a social problem and a serious crime; and the popularization of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], [[repressed memory]], and corresponding survivor movement.{{sfn|Bromley|Richardson|Best|1991 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yt1uw2QOmDQC&amp;pg=PA5 5–10]}}

''Michelle Remembers'', written by Michelle Smith and her husband, the psychiatrist [[Lawrence Pazder]], was published in 1980.

The early 1980s, during the implementation of [[mandatory reporting]] laws, saw a large increase in child protection investigations in [[United States|America]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and other developed countries, along with a heightened public awareness of [[child abuse]]. The investigation of incest allegations in [[California]] was also changed, with cases led by [[social work]]ers who used leading and coercive interviewing techniques that had been avoided by police investigators. Such changes in the prosecution of cases of alleged incest resulted in an increase in confessions by fathers in exchange for [[plea bargain]]s.{{sfn|Nathan|Snedeker|1995|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, some children in child protection cases began making allegations of horrific physical and sexual abuse by caregivers within organized rituals, claiming sexual abuse in Satanic rituals and the use of Satanic symbols.

In 1983, charges were laid in the [[McMartin preschool trial]], a major case in California, which received attention throughout the United States and contained allegations of satanic ritual abuse. The case caused tremendous polarization in how to interpret the available evidence.{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |p=58}} Shortly afterward, more than 100 preschools across the country became the object of similar sensationalist allegations, which were eagerly and uncritically reported by the press.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA117 117]}} Throughout the McMartin trial, media coverage of the defendants (Peggy McMartin and Ray Buckey) was unrelentingly negative, focusing only on statements by the prosecution.{{sfn |Eberle |Eberle |1993}} Michelle Smith and other alleged survivors met with parents involved in the trial, and it is believed that they influenced testimony against the accused.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA15 15]}}{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=205–13}}{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA56 56]}}{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |p=89}}

[[Kee MacFarlane]], a social worker employed by the [[Children's Institute International]], developed a new way to interrogate children with [[anatomically correct doll]]s and used them in an effort to assist disclosures of abuse with the McMartin children. After asking the children to point to the places on the dolls where they had allegedly been touched and asking [[leading question]]s, MacFarlane diagnosed sexual abuse in virtually all the McMartin children.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |pp=79–80}} She coerced disclosures by using lengthy interviews that rewarded discussions of abuse and punished denials. The trial testimony that resulted from such methods was often contradictory and vague on all details except for the assertion that the abuse had occurred.{{sfn |Eberle |Eberle |1993}} Although the initial charges in the McMartin case featured allegations of Satanic abuse and a vast conspiracy, these features were dropped relatively early in the trial, and prosecution continued only for non-ritual allegations of child abuse against only two defendants.&lt;ref name=Intimate&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=P |title=Intimate enemies: moral panics in contemporary Great Britain |publisher=[[Transaction Publishers|Aldine de Gruyter]] |location=New York |year=1992 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JQQWfqtES5MC&amp;pg=PA151 151–76] |isbn=0-202-30435-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of testimony, McMartin and Buckey were [[acquittal|acquitted]] on 52 of 65 counts, and the jury was deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges against Buckey, with 11 of 13 jurors choosing not guilty. Buckey was re-charged and two years later released without conviction.{{sfn |Eberle |Eberle |1993}}

===Conspiracy accusations===
In 1984 MacFarlane warned a congressional committee of [[scatological]] behavior and animals being slaughtered in bizarre rituals that children were forced to watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacFarlane |first=K |title=Child Abuse and Day Care: Joint hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight of the Committee of Ways and Means, and Select committee on Children, Youth, and Families" (testimony by [[Kee MacFarlane]]) |date=1984-09-17 |pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the [[United States Congress]] doubled its budget for child-protection programs. Psychiatrist [[Roland Summit]] delivered conferences in the wake of the McMartin trial and depicted the phenomenon as a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] that involved anyone skeptical of the phenomenon.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |pp=102–03}} By 1986, social worker Carol Darling argued to a [[grand jury]] that the conspiracy reached the government.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |pp=102–03}} Her husband Brad Darling gave conference presentations about a Satanic conspiracy of great antiquity which he believed now permeated American communities.{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA60 60–62]}}

By the late 1980s, therapists or patients who believed someone had suffered from SRA could suggest solutions that included [[Christian psychology|Christian psychotherapy]], [[exorcism]], and support groups whose members self-identified as "anti-Satanic warriors."{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA69 69]}} Federal funding was increased for research on child abuse, with large portions of the funding allocated for research on child sexual abuse. Funding was also provided for conferences supporting the idea of SRA, adding a veneer of respectability to the idea as well as offering an opportunity for prosecutors to exchange advice on how to best secure convictions—with tactics including destruction of notes, refusing to tape interviews with children, and destroying or refusing to share evidence with the defense.{{sfn|Nathan|Snedeker|1995}} Had proof been found, SRA would have represented the first occasion where an organized and secret criminal activity had been discovered by mental health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=1-55798-521-9 |editor=DeRivera J |editor2=Sarbin T |title=Believed-In-Imaginings: The Narrative Construction of Reality |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |year=1998 |location=Washington, D.C. |page=203 |chapter=Construction of Satanic Ritual Abuse and the Creation of False Memories |last=Victor |first=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 [[Geraldo Rivera]] produced a national television special on the alleged secret cults, claiming "Estimates are that there are over one million Satanists in [the United States and they are] linked in a highly organized, secretive network."{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA32 32–33]}} Tapings of this and similar talk show episodes were subsequently used by [[Fundamentalism|religious fundamentalists]], [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapists]], [[social work]]ers and police to promote the idea that a conspiracy of Satanic cults existed and was committing serious crimes.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA45 45], [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA69 69], [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA166 166], [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA254 254] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA343 343]}}

In the 1990s psychologist D. Corydon Hammond publicized a detailed theory of ritual abuse drawn from [[hypnotherapy]] sessions with his patients, alleging they were victims of a worldwide conspiracy of organized, secretive [[Clandestine cell system|clandestine cells]] who used torture, [[mind control]] and ritual abuse to create [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personalities]] that could be "activated" with code words; the victims were allegedly trained as assassins, prostitutes, drug traffickers, and child sex workers (to create [[child pornography]]). Hammond claimed his patients had revealed the conspiracy was masterminded by a Jewish doctor in [[Nazi Germany]], but who now worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] with a goal of worldwide domination by a Satanic cult. The cult was allegedly composed of respectable, powerful members of society who used the funds generated to further their agenda. Missing memories among the victims and absence of evidence was cited as evidence of the power and effectiveness of this cult in furthering its agenda. Hammond's claims gained considerable attention, due in part to his prominence in the field of [[hypnosis]] and psychotherapy.{{sfn |McNally |2003 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=88Axi0huzYwC&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 235–37]}}

===Religious roots and secularization===
Satanic ritual abuse brought together several groups normally unlikely to associate, including psychotherapists, self-help groups, religious fundamentalists and law enforcement.&lt;ref name = DeYoung1994/&gt;  Initial accusations were made in the context of the rising political power of [[Christian right|conservative Christianity]] within the United States,&lt;ref name=Donner/&gt; and religious fundamentalists enthusiastically promoted rumors of SRA.&lt;ref name=Intimate/&gt; Psychotherapists who were actively Christian advocated for the diagnosis of [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID); soon after, accounts similar to ''Michelle Remembers'' began to appear, with some therapists believing the alter egos of some patients were the result of [[demonic possession]].&lt;ref name=Spanos/&gt; [[Protestantism]] was instrumental in starting, spreading, and maintaining rumors through sermons about the dangers of SRA, lectures by purported experts, and prayer sessions, including showings of the 1987 Geraldo Rivera television special.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA46 46–47] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA68 68–70]}} Secular proponents appeared,{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA2 2], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA12 12], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA18 18] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}} and child protection workers became significantly involved. Law enforcement trainers, many themselves strongly religious, became strong promoters of the claims and self-described "experts" on the topic. Their involvement in child sexual abuse cases produced more allegations of SRA, adding credibility to the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Donner/&gt; As the explanations for SRA were distanced from [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christianity and associated with "survivor" groups, the motivations ascribed to purported Satanists shifted from combating a religious nemesis, to mind control and abuse as an end to itself.&lt;ref name=Frankfurter2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frankfurter |first=D |year=2003 |volume=50 |journal=Numen |title=The satanic ritual abuse panic as religious-studies data |pages=108–17 |doi=10.1163/156852703321103265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinicians, psychotherapists and social workers documented clients with alleged histories of SRA,&lt;ref name = Donner/&gt;&lt;ref name=VS&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinason |first=V |title=Treating survivors of satanist abuse |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=New York |year=1994 |isbn=0-415-10543-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jonker1991&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jonker |first=F |author2=Jonker-Bakker P  |year=1991 |title=Experiences with ritualist child sexual abuse: a case study from the Netherlands |journal=Child Abuse and Neglect |volume=15 |pages=191–96 |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=EJ429991 |accessdate=2007-10-20 |pmid=2043971 |doi=10.1016/0145-2134(91)90064-K |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the claims of therapists were unsubstantiated beyond the testimonies of their clients.&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt;{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA86 86–87]}}{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA192 192–95]}}

===International spread===
In 1987 a list of "indicators" was published by Catherine Gould,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=C |title=Satanic ritual abuse: child victims, adult survivors, system response |journal=California Psychologist |year=1987 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=9–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a broad array of vague symptoms that were ultimately common, non-specific and subjective, capable of diagnosing SRA in most young children.&lt;ref name=Intimate/&gt; By the late 1980s allegations began to appear throughout the world (including [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Scandinavia]]), in part enabled by [[English language|English]] as a common international language and in the United Kingdom, assisted by Gould's list of indicators. Belief in SRA spread rapidly through the ranks of mental health professionals (despite an absence of evidence) through a variety of continuing education seminars, during which attendees were urged to believe in the reality of Satanic cults their victims, and not to question the extreme and bizarre memories uncovered. Proof was provided in the form of unconnected bits of information such as pictures drawn by patients, heavy metal album covers, historical folklore about devil worshipers, and pictures of mutilated animals. During the seminars, patients provided testimonials of their experiences and presenters stressed that recovering memories was important for healing.{{sfn |McNally |2003 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=88Axi0huzYwC&amp;pg=PA244#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 244]}}

Some [[Feminism|feminist]] critics of the SRA diagnoses maintained that, in the course of attempting to purge society of evil, the panic of the 1980s and 1990s obscured real child-abuse issues, a concern echoed by Gary Clapton.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |p=1}} In England, the SRA panic diverted resources and attention from proven abuse cases; this resulted in a hierarchy of abuse in which SRA was the most serious form, physical and sexual abuse being minimized and/or marginalized, and "mere" physical abuse no longer worthy of intervention.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |pp=14–18}} In addition, as criticism of SRA investigation increased, the focus by social workers on SRA resulted in a large loss of credibility to the profession.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |pp=23–28}} SRA, with its sensational makeup of many victims abused by many victimizers, ended up robbing the far more common and proven issue of [[incest]] of much of its societal significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Armstrong |first=L |title=Rocking the Cradle of Sexual Politics |publisher=[[Addison–Wesley]] |year=1994 |location=Reading, Mass. |pages=257–59 |isbn=0-7043-4460-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Center for Abuse and Neglect devised the term "religious abuse" to describe [[exorcism]], [[poison]]ing, and drowning of children in non-satanic religious settings in order to avoid confusion with SRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodman |first=G |last2=Qin |first2=J |last3=Bottoms |first3=BL |last4=Shaver |first4=PR |title=Characteristics and Sources of Allegations of Ritualistic Child Abuse |publisher=Center for Abuse and Neglect |year=1994 |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=99–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA223 223–24]}}

By the early 1990s, the phrase "Satanic ritual abuse" was featured in media coverage of ritualistic abuse but its use decreased among professionals in favour of more nuanced terms such as multi-dimensional child sex rings,&lt;ref name=Lanning&gt;{{Cite journal |format=PDF |first=Kenneth V. |last=Lanning |title=Investigator's Guide to Allegations of "Ritual" Childhood Abuse |year=1992 | url = http://www.pointnet.ca/media/igtaorca.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20031025012607/http://www.pointnet.ca/media/igtaorca.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2003-10-25}}; &lt;/ref&gt; ritual/ritualistic abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hudson |first=PS |title=Ritual child abuse: discovery, diagnosis, and treatment |publisher=R&amp;E Publishers |location=Saratoga, Calif |year=1991 |isbn=0-88247-867-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; organised abuse{{sfn |Bibby |1996}} or [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] abuse,&lt;ref name=VS/&gt; some of which acknowledged the complexity of abuse cases with multiple perpetrators and victims without projecting a religious framework onto perpetrators. The latter in particular failed to substantively improve on or replace "Satanic" abuse as it was never used to describe any rituals except the Satanic ones that were the core of SRA allegations. Abuse within the context of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] or any other religions failed to enter the SRA discourse.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |p=25}}

===Cult-based abuse===
Allegation of cult-based abuse is the most extreme scenario of SRA.{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}} During the initial period of interest starting in the early 1980s the term was used to describe a network of [[Satan]]-worshipping, secretive intergenerational cults that were supposedly part of a highly organized [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] engaged in criminal behaviors such as forced [[prostitution]], [[Illegal drug trade|drug distribution]] and [[pornography]]. These cults were also thought to sexually abuse and [[torture]] children in order to coerce them into a lifetime of [[Theistic Satanism#Preconceptions and myths|Devil worship]].{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA3 3–4]}} Other allegations included bizarre sexual acts such as [[necrophilia]], forced [[ingestion of semen]], [[blood]] and [[feces]], [[cannibalism]], [[orgies]], liturgical parody such as pseudosacramental use of feces and urine; [[infanticide]], sacrificial abortions to eat [[fetus]]es and [[human sacrifice]]; satanic police officers who covered up evidence of SRA crimes and desecration of Christian [[grave (burial)|graves]].{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}}{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA127 127]}} No evidence of any of these claims has ever been found;&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt;{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA3 3–4]}}&lt;ref name=Putnam1991&gt;{{cite journal |last=Putnam |first=F.W. |year=1991 |title=The Satanic Ritual Abuse Controversy |journal=Child Abuse and Neglect: the International Journal |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=175–79 |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=EJ429989 |accessdate=2008-06-10 |doi=10.1016/0145-2134(91)90062-I}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998}} the proof presented by those who alleged the reality of cult-based abuse primarily consisted of the memories of adults recalling childhood abuse,{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |p=55}}{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}} the testimony of young children{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |p=55}}{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}}{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA16 16–17]}} and extremely controversial confessions.{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}} The idea of a murderous Satanic conspiracy created a controversy dividing the professional [[child abuse]] community at the time, though no evidence has been found to support allegations of a large number of children being killed or abused in Satanic rituals.&lt;ref name=Putnam1991/&gt;{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PR13 xiii]}} From a law enforcement perspective, an intergenerational conspiracy dedicated to ritual sacrifice whose members remain completely silent, make no mistakes and leave no [[physical evidence]] is unlikely; cases of what the media incorrectly perceived as actual cult sacrifices (such as the 1989 case of [[Adolfo Constanzo]]) have supported this idea.&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt;

===Criminal and delusional satanism===
A third variation of ritual abuse involves non-religious ritual abuse in which the rituals were [[delusion]]al or [[obsessive compulsive disorder|obsessive]].&lt;ref name=Finkelhor/&gt; There are incidents of extreme sadistic crimes that are committed by individuals, loosely organized families and possibly in some organized cults, some of which may be connected to Satanism, though this is more likely to be related to [[sex trafficking]]; though SRA may happen in families, extended families and localized groups, it is not believed to occur in large, organized groups.{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |pp=64–65}}

===Acting out===
Investigators considered [[graffiti]] such as the [[pentagram]] to be evidence of a Satanic cult. Ambiguous crimes in which actual or erroneously believed symbols of Satanism appear have also been claimed as part of the SRA phenomenon, though in most cases the crimes cannot be linked to a specific belief system; minor crimes such as vandalism, trespassing and graffiti were often found to be the actions of teenagers who were acting out.&lt;ref name="pmid1471565"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8356163"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1962303"/&gt;

===Polarization===

There was never any consensus on what actually constituted Satanic ritual abuse.&lt;ref name=deYoung2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Young |first=M |authorlink=Mary de Young |year=2007 |title=Two decades after McMartin: a follow-up of 22 convicted day care employees |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYZ/is_4_34/ai_n25466116/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925172921/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYZ/is_4_34/ai_n25466116/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-25 |accessdate=2008-08-11 |journal=Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=9–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of a single definition, as well as confusion between the meanings of the term "ritual" ([[Ritual#Religious|religious]] versus [[Ritual#Psychology|psychological]]) allowed a wide range of allegations and evidence to be claimed as a demonstration of the reality of SRA claims, irrespective of which "definition" the evidence supported.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=205–13}} Acrimonious disagreements between groups who supported SRA allegations as authentic and those criticizing them as unsubstantiated resulted in an extremely polarized discussion with little middle ground.&lt;ref name=Fraser&gt;{{cite book |last=Fraser |first=GA |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |year=1997 |title=The Dilemma of Ritual Abuse: Cautions and Guides for Therapists |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4CMHRXz5qsQC&amp;pg=PA105 105–17] |isbn=0-88048-478-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}} The lack of credible evidence for the more extreme interpretations often being seen as evidence of an effective conspiracy rather than an indication that the allegations are unfounded. The atheistic or religious beliefs of the disputants have also resulted in different interpretations of evidence, and as well as accusations of those who reject the claims being "anti-child".{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}}{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |pp=18–22}} Both believers and skeptics have developed networks to disseminate information on their respective positions.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=27–28}} One of the central themes of the discussion among English child abuse professionals was the assertion that people should simply "believe the children", and that the testimony of children was sufficient proof, which ignored the fact that in many cases the testimony of children was interpreted by professionals rather than the children explicitly disclosing allegations of abuse. In some cases this was simultaneously presented with the idea that it did not matter if SRA actually existed, that the [[empiricism|empirical]] truth of SRA was irrelevant, that the testimony of children was more important than that of doctors, social workers and the criminal justice system.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |pp=18–22}}

==Evidence==
The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect conducted a study led by [[University of California, Davis|University of California]] psychologist [[Gail Goodman]], which found that among 12,000 accusations of satanic ritual abuse, there was no evidence for "a well-organized intergenerational satanic cult, who sexually molested and tortured children", although there was "convincing evidence of lone perpetrators or couples who say they are involved with Satan or use the claim to intimidate victims."&lt;ref name="Goleman1994"/&gt; One such case Goodman studied involved "grandparents [who] had black robes, candles, and Christ on an inverted crucifix--and the children had chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease, in their throats", according to the report by a [[district attorney]].&lt;ref name="Goleman1994"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/31/us/proof-lacking-for-ritual-abuse-by-satanists.html?sq=satanic+ritual+abuse&amp;scp=1&amp;st=nyt|title=Proof Lacking for Ritual Abuse by Satanists|last=Goleman|first=Daniel|year=1994|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|language=English|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence for SRA was primarily in the form of testimonies from children who made allegations of SRA, and adults who claim to remember abuse during childhood,&lt;ref name=Utah&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saferchildren.net/print/utahrataskforce.pdf |date= 1992-05-01 |accessdate=2007-11-26 |title=Report of Utah State Task Force on Ritual Abuse |publisher=Utah Governor's Commission for Women and Families |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA79 79]}} that may have been forgotten and [[Recovered memory therapy|recovered during therapy]].{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |p=55}}{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}}{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |p=18}}{{sfn|Perrin|Miller-Perrin|2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AJgxUqce5GcC&amp;pg=PA318 318–20]}}&lt;ref name=Furies&gt;{{cite book |last=Underwager |first=Ralph C. |last2=Wakefield |first2=Hollida |title=Return of the furies: an investigation into recovered memory therapy |publisher=Open Court |location=La Salle, Ill |year=1995 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iE1-i0umaTsC&amp;pg=PA317 317–21] |isbn=0-8126-9272-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; With both children and adults, no corroborating evidence has been found for anything except [[#Pseudo-satanism|pseudosatanism]] in which the satanic and ritual aspects were secondary to and used as a cover for sexual abuse.{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}} Despite this lack of objective evidence, and aided by the competing definitions of what SRA actually was, proponents claimed SRA was a real phenomenon throughout the peak and during the decline of the moral panic.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |p=18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Devine |first=Susan E. |last2=Sakheim |first2=David K. |title=Out of darkness: exploring satanism and ritual abuse |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year=1992 |page=173 |isbn=0-669-26962-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite allegations appearing in the United States, Netherlands, Sweden, New Zealand and Australia, no material evidence has been found to corroborate allegations of organized cult-based abuse that practices human sacrifice and cannibalism.&lt;ref name=Furies/&gt;{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA123 123]}} Though trauma specialists frequently claimed the allegations made by children and adults were the same, in reality the statements made by adults were more elaborate, severe, and featured more bizarre abuse.

For several years, a conviction list assembled by the [[Believe the Children]] advocacy group was circulated as proof of the truth of satanic ritual abuse allegations, though the organization itself no longer exists and the list itself is "egregiously out of date".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=0-7864-1830-3 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC&amp;pg=PA54 54] |title=The day care ritual abuse moral panic |last=de Young |first=M |authorlink=Mary de Young |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations===
Two investigations were carried out to assess the evidence for SRA. In the United States, evidence was reported but was based on a flawed methodology with an overly liberal definition of a substantiated case. In the United Kingdom, a government report produced no evidence of SRA, but several examples of false satanists faking rituals to frighten their victims.

====United States====
[[David Finkelhor]] completed an investigation of child sexual abuse in daycares in the United States, and published a report in 1988. The report found 270 cases of sexual abuse, of which 36 were classified as substantiated cases of ritual abuse.&lt;ref name=Finkelhor/&gt; [[Mary de Young]] has pointed out that the report's definition of "substantiated" was overly liberal as it required only that one agency had decided that abuse had occurred, even if no action was taken, no arrests made, no operating licenses suspended. In addition, multiple agencies may have been involved in each case (including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], local police, social services agencies and childhood protective services in many cases), with wide differences in suspicion and confirmation, often in disagreement with each other. Finkelhor, upon receiving a "confirmation", would collect information from whoever was willing or interested to provide it and did not independently investigate the cases, resulting in frequent errors in their conclusions. No data is provided beyond case studies and brief summaries.{{sfn |de Young |2004 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC&amp;pg=PA102 102]}} Three other cases considered corroborating by the public—the [[McMartin preschool trial]], the [[Day-care sex-abuse hysteria#Country Walk|Country Walk case]] and the murders in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], by [[Adolfo Constanzo]]—ultimately failed to support the existence of SRA. The primary witness in the Country Walk case repeatedly made, then withdrew accusations against her husband amid unusual and coercive inquiries by her lawyer and a psychologist. The Matamoros murders produced the bodies of 12 adults who were ritually sacrificed by a drug gang inspired by the film ''[[The Believers]]'', but did not involve children or sexual abuse. The McMartin case resulted in no convictions and was ultimately based on accusations by children with no proof beyond their coerced testimonies.{{sfn |Faller |2003 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FkT2wTGTUAoC&amp;pg=PA29 29–33]}} A 1996 investigation of more than 12,000 allegations of satanic, ritual and religious abuse resulted in no cases that were considered factual or corroborated.&lt;ref name=Bottoms1996&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bottoms |first=B.L. |last2=Shaver |first2=P.R. |last3=Goodman |first3=G.S. |year=1996 |title=An analysis of ritualistic and religion-related child abuse allegations |journal=Law and Human Behavior |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1–34 |doi=10.1007/BF01499130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
A British study published in 1996 found 62 cases of alleged ritual abuse reported to researchers by police, social and welfare agencies from the period of 1988 to 1991, representing a tiny proportion of extremely high-profile cases compared to the total number investigated by the agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes &amp; Parker in Bibby, 1996, pp. 215–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Jean LaFontaine spent several years researching ritual abuse cases in Britain at the behest of the government, finding that all of the cases of alleged satanic ritual abuse that could be substantiated were cases where the perpetrators' goal was sexual gratification rather than religious worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/94959.article | title = Satanic Disabuser | last = Kitzinger | first = Celia | date = 1995-08-28 | accessdate = 2014-10-16 | journal = [[Times Higher Education]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producing several reports and the 1998 book ''Speak of the Devil'', after reviewing cases reported to police and children's protective services throughout the country LaFontaine concluded that the only rituals she uncovered were those invented by child abusers to frighten their victims or justify the sexual abuse. In addition, the sexual abuse occurred outside of the rituals, indicating the goal of the abuser was sexual gratification rather than ritualistic or religious. In cases involving satanic abuse, the satanic allegations by younger children were influenced by adults, and the concerns over the satanic aspects were found to be compelling due to cultural attraction of the concept, but distracting from the actual harm caused to the abuse victims.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=205–13}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=LaFontaine |first=J S. |title=The extent and nature of organised and ritual abuse: research findings |publisher=HMSO |location=London |year=1994 |isbn=0-11-321797-8 |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=157278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, discredited allegations of SRA have been levelled against [[Jimmy Saville]] during [[Operation Yewtree|the posthumous investigation]] into [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|his sexual abuse of children]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=French|first1=Chris|title=Satanic child abuse claims are almost certainly based on false memories|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/18/satanic-child-abuse-false-memories-scotland|accessdate=27 February 2017|work=The Guardian|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as against former Prime Minister [[Ted Heath]] (who was previously falsely accused of SRA within his lifetime).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Martin|title=Sir Edward Heath sex investigation could be shut down as police expert says satanic ritual abuse claims are 'pernicious fabrication'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/26/sir-edward-heath-sex-abuse-investigation-could-shut/|accessdate=27 February 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient allegations===
The majority of adult testimonials occurred as a result of adults undergoing psychotherapy, in most cases therapy designed to elicit memories of SRA.&lt;ref name=Frankfurter2003/&gt;{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}} Therapists claimed the pain expressed by the patients, internal consistency of their stories and similarity of allegations by different patients was evidence for SRA, but despite this, the disclosures of patients never resulted in any corroboration;{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA86 86]}} Allegations of alleged victims that were obtained from mental health practitioners lacked verifiable evidence, were [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] and involved incidents that were years or decades old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Final Report of the Task Force Studying Ritual Crime |publisher=Crime Commission Task Force Studying Ritual Criminal Activity |location=Richmond, VA |year=1991}}; cited in Victor, 1993, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA263 263–64].&lt;/ref&gt; The concern for therapists revolved around the pain of their clients, which is for them more important than the truth of their patients' statements.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=27–28}} A sample of 29 patients in a medical clinic reporting SRA found no corroboration of the claims in medical records or in discussion with family members.&lt;ref name=Coons&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coons |first=PM |title=Reports of satanic ritual abuse: further implications about pseudomemories |journal=Percept Mot Skills |volume=78 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=1376–78 |date=June 1994 |pmid=7936968 |doi=10.2466/pms.1994.78.3c.1376}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a survey of 2,709 American therapists found the majority of allegations of SRA came from only sixteen therapists, suggesting that the determining factor in a patient making allegations of SRA was the therapist's predisposition.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA257 257–58]}} Further, the alleged similarities between patient accounts (particularly between adults and children) turned out to be illusory upon review, with adults describing far more elaborate, severe and bizarre abuse than children. Bette Bottoms, who reviewed hundreds of claims of adult and child abuse, described the ultimate evidence for the abuse as "astonishingly weak and ambiguous" particularly given the severity of the alleged abuse. Therapists however, were found to believe patients more as the allegations became more bizarre and severe.{{sfn |McNally |2003 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=88Axi0huzYwC&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 238]}}

In cases where patients made claims that were physically impossible, or evidence found by police was contradictory, the details reported will often change. If patients pointed to a spot where a body was buried, but no body was found and no earth was disturbed, therapists resort to [[special pleading]], saying the patient was hypnotically programmed to direct investigators to the wrong location, or that they were fooled by the cult into believing a crime was not committed. If alleged bodies were cremated and police point out ordinary fires are inadequate to completely destroy a body, stories include special industrial furnaces. The patients' allegations change and creatively find "solutions" to objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Showalter |isbn=0-231-10459-6 |year=1998 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lTL34npiiV0C&amp;pg=PA179 179–80] |title=Hystories : hysterical epidemics and modern media |first=E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's allegations===
The second group to make allegations of SRA were young children. During the "satanic panic" of the 1980s, the techniques used by investigators to gather evidence from witnesses, particularly young children, evolved to become very leading, coercive and suggestive, pressuring young children to provide testimony and refusing to accept denials while offering inducements that encouraged false disclosures.&lt;ref name=Frankfurter2003/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schreiber et al."/&gt;{{sfn|Nathan|Snedeker|1995}} The interviewing techniques used were the factors believed to have led to the construction of the bizarre disclosures of SRA by the children{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA56 56ff], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA61 61–65], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA73 73f] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA192 192–95]}} and changes to forensic and interviewing techniques since that time has resulted in a disappearance of the allegations.&lt;ref name=Donner/&gt; Analysis of the techniques used in two key cases (the McMartin preschool and [[Wee Care Nursery School]] trials) concluded that the children were questioned in a highly suggestive manner. Compared with a set of interviews from [[Child Protective Services]], the interviews from the two trials were "significantly more likely to (a) introduce new suggestive information into the interview, (b) provide praise, promises, and positive reinforcement, (c) express disapproval, disbelief, or disagreement with children, (d) exert conformity pressure, and (e) invite children to pretend or speculate about supposed events."&lt;ref name="Schreiber et al."/&gt;

A variety of these allegations resulted in criminal convictions; in an analysis of these cases [[Mary de Young]] found that many had had their convictions overturned. Of 22 day care employees and their sentences reviewed in 2007, three were still incarcerated, eleven had charges dismissed or overturned, and eight were released before serving their full sentences.

In his book ''Satanic Panic'', Jeffery Victor writes that, in the United States, the groups most likely to believe rumors of SRA are rural, poorly educated, religiously [[Christian right|conservative]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] families with an unquestioning belief in [[Culture of the United States|American values]] who feel significant anxieties over job loss, economic decline and family disintegration. Victor considers rumours of SRA a symptom of a moral crisis and a form of [[scapegoat]]ing for economic and social ills.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA55 55–56]}}

===Origins of the rumors===
Information about SRA claims spread through conferences presented to religious groups, churches and professionals such as police forces and therapists as well as parents. These conferences and presentations served to organize agencies and foster communication between groups, maintaining and spreading disproven or exaggerated stories as fact.&lt;ref name=CA/&gt; Members of local police forces organized into loose networks focused on cult crimes, some of whom billed themselves as "experts" and were paid to speak at conferences throughout the United States. Religious revivalists also took advantage of the rumors and preached about the dangers of Satanism to youth and presented themselves at paid engagements as secular experts.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA22 22–23]}} At the height of the panic, the highly emotional accusations and circumstances of SRA allegations made it difficult to investigate the claims, with the accused being assumed as guilty and skeptics becoming co-accused during trials, and trials moving forward based solely on the testimony of very young children without corroborating evidence.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA16 16–17]}} No [[forensic evidence|forensic]] or corroborating evidence has ever been found for religiously based cannibalistic or murderous SRA, despite extensive investigations.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=205–13}}&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA213 213]}} The concern and reaction expressed by various groups regarding the seriousness or threat of SRA has been considered out of proportion to the actual threat by satanically motivated crimes, and the rare crime that exists that may be labeled "satanic" does not justify the existence of a conspiracy or network of religiously motivated child abusers.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins |first=T |title=Satanic Panic: The Creation of a Contemporary Legend – book reviews |journal=Sociology of Religion |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0SOR/is_n3_v55/ai_15729291/pg_1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924132924/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0SOR/is_n3_v55/ai_15729291/pg_1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-24 |year=1994 |accessdate=2008-06-27 |doi=10.2307/3712069 |volume=55 |last2=Victor |first2=Jeffrey S. |jstor=3712069 |issue=3 |pages=373–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA20 20–21]}}

===Scholarly and law enforcement investigations===
Jeffrey Victor reviewed 67 rumors about SRA in the United States and Canada reported in newspapers or television, and found no evidence supporting the existence of murderous satanic cults.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA330 330–54]}} LaFontaine states that cases of alleged SRA investigated in the [[United Kingdom]] were reviewed in detail and the majority were unsubstantiated; three were found to involve sexual abuse of children in the context of rituals, but none involved the [[Witches' Sabbath]] or devil worship that are characteristic of allegations of SRA.{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}} LaFontaine also states that no material evidence has been forthcoming in allegations of SRA; no bones, bodies or blood, in either the United States or Britain.

Kenneth Lanning, an [[FBI]] expert in the investigation of child sexual abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress02/heimbach050102.htm |title=Testimony of Michael J. Heimbach, Crimes Against Children Unit |last=Heimbach |first=MJ |date=2002-05-01 |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=2008-04-30 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061230100851/http://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress02/heimbach050102.htm | archivedate = 2006-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; has stated that pseudo-Satanism may exist but there is "little or no evidence for ... large-scale baby breeding, human sacrifice, and organized satanic conspiracies".&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;There are many possible alternative answers to the question of why victims are alleging things that don't seem to be true....I believe that there is a middle ground—a continuum of possible activity. Some of what the victims allege may be true and accurate, some may be misperceived or distorted, some may be screened or symbolic, and some may be "contaminated" or false. The problem and challenge, especially for law enforcement, is to determine which is which. This can only be done through active investigation. I believe that the majority of victims alleging "ritual" abuse are in fact victims of some form of abuse or trauma.&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lanning produced a [[monograph]] in 1994 on SRA aimed at child protection authorities, which contained his opinion that despite hundreds of investigations no corroboration of SRA had been found. Following this report, several convictions based on SRA allegations were overturned and the defendants released.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |p=230}}

Reported cases of SRA involve bizarre activities, some of which are impossible (like people flying),&lt;ref name="Schreiber et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schreiber |first=Nadja |last2=Bellah |first2=Lisa |last3=Martinez |first3=Yolanda |last4=McLaurin |first4=Kristin |last5=, Renata Stok, Sena Garven and James Wood |title=Suggestive interviewing in the McMartin Preschool and Kelly Michaels daycare abuse cases: A case study |journal=Social Influence |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=16–46 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2006 |url=http://digitalcommons.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=james_wood |doi=10.1080/15534510500361739}}&lt;/ref&gt; that makes the credibility of victims of child sexual abuse questionable. In cases where SRA is alleged to occur, Lanning describes common dynamics of the use of fear to control multiple young victims, the presence of multiple perpetrators and strange or ritualized behaviors, though allegations of crimes such as human sacrifice and cannibalism do not seem to be true. Lanning also suggests several reasons why adult victims may make allegations of SRA, including "pathological distortion, traumatic memory, normal childhood fears and fantasies, misperception, and confusion".&lt;ref name="Lanning2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Search/Abstracts.aspx?id=159841&amp;library=Publications_Lib&amp;query=%26lt%3BRecordset%26gt%3B%26lt%3BLibrary%20name%3D%26quot%3BPublications_Lib%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3BField%20name%3D%26quot%3BDOC_BODY%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3BQuery%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%21%5BCDATA%5BLanning%5D%5D%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Query%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Field%26gt%3B%26lt%3BField%20name%3D%26quot%3Bis_full_text%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3BQuery%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%21%5BCDATA%5BN%5D%5D%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Query%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Field%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Library%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Recordset%26gt%3B|title=Satanic Ritual Abuse of Children Is Not Widespread|last=Lanning|first=K|publisher=[[Greenhaven Press]], Inc|year=1994|editor=Bender D|series=Opposing Viewpoints Series|accessdate=2008-04-29|editor2=Leone, B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court cases==
{{Main article |List of satanic ritual abuse allegations}}
Allegations of SRA have appeared throughout the world. The failure of certain high-profile legal cases generated worldwide media attention, and came to play a central feature in the growing controversies over child abuse, memory and the law.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, DP, Scheflin, AW &amp; Hammond, DC |title=Memory, trauma treatment, and the law |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=0-393-70254-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source |date=August 2008}} The testimony of children in these cases may have led to their collapse, as juries came to believe that the sources of the allegations were the use of suggestive and manipulative interviewing techniques, rather than actual events. Research since that time has supported these concerns and without the use of these techniques it is unlikely the cases would ever have reached trial.&lt;ref name=Donner/&gt;

In one analysis of 36 court cases involving sexual abuse of children within rituals, only one quarter resulted in convictions and the convictions had little to do with ritual sex abuse.&lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Charlier |first=T |author2=Downing S  |year=1988 |title=Allegations Rife, Evidence Slight |publisher=[[The Commercial Appeal]] |location=Memphis, TN}}; cited in Victor, 1993, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 survey of more than 11,000 psychiatric and police workers throughout the US, conducted for the [[National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect]], researchers investigated approximately 12,000 accusations of group cult sexual abuse based on satanic ritual. The survey found no substantiated reports of well-organized satanic rings of people who sexually abuse children, but did find incidents in which the ritualistic aspects were secondary to the abuse and were used to intimidate victims.&lt;ref name="NCCAN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02EEDD1E3FF932A05753C1A962958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=satanic+ritual+abuse&amp;st=nyt|title=Proof Lacking for Ritual Abuse by Satanists|last=Goleman|first=D|date=1994-10-31|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor reviewed 21 court cases alleging SRA between 1983 and 1987 in which no prosecutions were obtained for ritual abuse.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=355–61}}

During the early 1980s, some courts attempted ''[[ad hoc]]'' accommodations to address the anxieties of child witnesses in relation to testifying before defendants. Screens or [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]] technology are a common feature of child sexual assault trials today; children in the early 1980s were typically forced into direct visual contact with the accused abuser while in court. SRA allegations in the courts catalyzed a broad agenda of research into the nature of children's testimony and the reliability of their oral evidence in court. Ultimately in SRA cases, the coercive techniques used by believing district attorneys, therapists and police officers were critical in establishing, and often resolving, SRA cases. In courts, when juries were able to see recordings or transcripts of interviews with children, the alleged abusers were acquitted. The reaction by successful prosecutors, spread throughout conventions and conferences on SRA, was to destroy, or fail to take notes of the interviews in the first place.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |pp=224–27}} One group of researchers concluded that children usually lack the sufficient amount of "explicit knowledge" of satanic ritual abuse to fabricate all of the details of an SRA claim on their own.&lt;ref name=Goodman1997&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodman, G.S. |author2=Quas, J.A. |author3=Bottoms, B.L. |author4=Qin, J. |author5=Shaver, P.R. |author6=Orcutt, H. |author7= Shapiro, C.  |year=1997 |title=Children's religious knowledge: Implications for understanding satanic ritual abuse allegations |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1111–30 |doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(97)00070-7 |pmid=9422831}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same researchers also concluded that children usually have the sufficient amount of general knowledge of "violence and the occult" to "serve as a starting point from which ritual claims could develop."&lt;ref name=Goodman1997/&gt;

In 2006, psychologist and attorney [[Christopher Barden]] drafted an ''amicus curiae'' brief to the California Supreme Court signed by nearly 100 international experts in the field of human memory emphasizing the lack of credible scientific support for repressed and recovered memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barden|first=R.C.|title=Amicus Brief in Taus v.

Other members of the panel included psychiatrist George Ganaway, anthropologist Sherrill Mulhern, and psychologist [[Richard Noll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Braun|first=Bennett G.|title=Dissociative Disorders, 1990: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Multiple Personality/Dissociative States...November 9–11, 1990|year=1990|publisher=Dissociative Disorders Program, Dept. of Psychiatry, Rush University|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Putnam, a skeptic, was viewed by SRA advocates in attendance as using fellow skeptics such as Noll and Mulhern as allies in a disinformation campaign to split the SRA-believing community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lockwood | first = C | title = Other Alters: Roots and Realities of Cultic and Satanic Ritual Abuse and Multiple Personality Disorder | year = 1993 | publisher = CompCare Publishers | location=Minneapolis, MN | pages = 14, 17|isbn=0-89638-363-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coons also pointed out that existing injuries could have been self-inflicted, that the experiences reported were "strikingly similar" and that "many of the SRA reports developed while patients were hospitalized".&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt; The reliability of memories of DID clients who alleged SRA in treatment has been questioned and a point of contention in the popular media and with clinicians; many of the allegations made are fundamentally impossible and alleged survivors lack the physical scars that would result were their allegations true.&lt;ref name=Van1990/&gt;

Many women claiming to be SRA survivors have been diagnosed as sufferers of DID, and it is unclear if their claims of childhood abuse are accurate or a manifestation of their diagnosis.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA89 89]}} Of a sample of 29 patients who presented with SRA, 22 were diagnosed with dissociative disorders including DID.

==False memories==
One explanation for the SRA allegations is that they were based upon false memories caused by the over-use of [[hypnosis]] and other suggestive techniques by therapists underestimating the suggestibility of their clients.&lt;ref&gt;Loftus &amp; Ketcham, 1996, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=13JZozT2kMYC&amp;pg=PA85 85].&lt;/ref&gt; The altered state of consciousness induced by hypnosis rendered patients an unusual ability to produce [[confabulation]]s, often with the assistance of their therapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ellis, Bill |title=Raising the devil: Satanism, new religions, and the media |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Ky |year=2000 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oLcqlypMCe8C&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 87–97] |isbn=0-8131-2170-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of [[false memory syndrome]] (FMS), a controversial term promoted by the [[False Memory Syndrome Foundation]], claim that the purported "memories" of ritual abuse are actually false memories, created [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenically]] through suggestion or coercion.&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt; The FMSF has used the idea of ritual abuse as a strategy to illustrate their position that most allegations of sexual abuse uncovered by the suggestive techniques used during recovered memory therapy are false "memories" of events that never happened. According to Kathleen Faller this has contributed to the sensationalization of the ritual abuse cases in the media.{{sfn |Faller |2003 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AJgxUqce5GcC&amp;pg=PA 51]}}

[[Paul R. McHugh]], professor of psychiatry at [[Johns Hopkins University]] discusses in his book ''Try to Remember'' the developments that led to the creation of false memories in the SRA moral panic and the formation of the FMSF as an effort to bring contemporary scientific research and political action to the polarizing struggle about false memories within the mental health disciplines. According to McHugh, there is no coherent scientific basis for the core belief of one side of the struggle, that sexual abuse can cause massive systemic repression of memories that can only be accessed through hypnosis, coercive interviews and other dubious techniques. The group of psychiatrists who promoted these ideas, whom McHugh terms "[[Mannerism|Mannerist]] Freudians", consistently followed a [[deductive reasoning|deductive approach]] to diagnosis in which the theory and causal explanation of symptoms was assumed to be childhood sexual abuse leading to dissociation, followed by a set of unproven and unreliable treatments with a strong [[confirmation bias]] that inevitably produced the allegations and causes that were assumed to be there. The treatment approach involved isolation of the patient from friends and family within psychiatric wards dedicated to the treatment of dissociation, filled with other patients who were treated by the same doctors with the same flawed methods and staff members who also coherently and universally ascribed to the same set of beliefs. These methods began in the 1980s and continued for several years until a series of court cases and [[medical malpractice]] lawsuits resulted in hospitals failing to support the approach. In cases where the dissociative symptoms were ignored, the coercive treatment approach ceased and the patients were removed from dedicated wards, allegations of satanic rape and abuse normally ceased, "recovered" memories were identified as fabrications and conventional treatments for presenting symptoms were generally successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McHugh |first=PR |authorlink=Paul R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6337">[[File:Ims aerial.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] has the largest seating capacity of any venue in the world.]]
'''Seating capacity''' is the number of [[people]] who can be seated in a specific space, in terms of both the physical space available, and limitations set by [[law]]. Seating capacity can be used in the description of anything ranging from an [[automobile]] that seats two to a [[stadium]] that seats hundreds of thousands of people. The largest sporting [[Sports venue|venue]] in the world, the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], has a permanent seating capacity for more than 235,000 people and infield seating that raises capacity to an approximate 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/jayski/cup/2017/story/_/id/20095750/analyzing-brantley-gilbert-big-machine-brickyard-400|title=Statistical Advance: Analyzing the Brantley Gilbert Big Machine Brickyard 400|publisher=''[[ESPN]]''|date=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In venues==
[[File:MCG stadium.jpg|right|thumb|An aerial view of the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] during the 1992 [[Cricket World Cup]] final packed with 90,000 people.]]
Safety is a primary concern in determining the seating capacity of a venue: "Seating capacity, seating layouts and densities are largely dictated by legal requirements for the safe evacuation of the occupants in the event of fire".&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Lawson, ''Conference, Convention, and Exhibit Facilities'' (1981), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The International Building Code specifies, "In places of assembly, the seats shall be securely fastened to the floor" but provides exceptions if the total number of seats is fewer than 100, if there is a substantial amount of space available between seats or if the seats are at tables.&lt;ref&gt;International Building Code (2006), 1025.12 Seat stability.&lt;/ref&gt; It also delineates the number of available exits for interior balconies and galleries based on the seating capacity,&lt;ref&gt;International Building Code (2006), 1025.5 Interior balcony and gallery means of egress.&lt;/ref&gt; and sets forth the number of required [[wheelchair]] spaces in a table derived from the seating capacity of the space.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Building Code]] (2006), 1108.2.2.1 General seating, Table 1108.2.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Fire Code, portions of which have been adopted by many jurisdictions, is directed more towards the use of a facility than the construction. It specifies, "For areas having fixed seating without dividing arms, the occupant load shall not be less than the number of seats based on one person for each 18 inches (457 mm) of seating length".&lt;ref&gt;International Fire Code (2006), 1004.7 Fixed seating.&lt;/ref&gt; It also requires that every public venue submit a detailed site plan to the local fire code official, including "details of the means of egress, seating capacity, [and] arrangement of the seating...."&lt;ref&gt;International Fire Code (2006), 1701.4 Site Plans.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once safety considerations have been satisfied, determinations of seating capacity turn on the total size of the venue, and its purpose. For sports venues, the "decision on maximum seating capacity is determined by several factors. Chief among these are the primary sports program and the size of the market area".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Wilkes, Robert T. Packard, ''Encyclopedia of Architecture: Design, Engineering &amp; Construction, Vol. 4'' (1989), p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt; In motion picture venues, the "limit of seating capacity is determined by the maximal viewing distance for a given size of screen", with image quality for closer viewers declining as the screen is expanded to accommodate more distant viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Society of Motion Picture Engineers, ''Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers'', Vol. 26 (1936), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seating capacity of venues also plays a role in what media they are able to provide and how they are able to provide it. In contracting to permit performers to use a theatre or other performing space, the "seating capacity of the performance facility must be disclosed".&lt;ref name="Grippo"&gt;Charles Grippo, ''The Stage Producer's Business and Legal Guide'' (2002), p. 43-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Seating capacity may influence the kind of contract to be used and the royalties to be given.&lt;ref name="Grippo"/&gt; The seating capacity must also be disclosed to the copyright owner in seeking a license for the copyrighted work to be performed in that venue.&lt;ref name="Grippo"/&gt;

Venues that may be leased for private functions such as [[ballroom]]s and auditoriums generally advertise their seating capacity. Seating capacity is also an important consideration in the construction and use of sports venues such as [[stadium]]s and [[arena]]s. When entities such as the [[National Football League]]'s [[Super Bowl]] Committee decide on a venue for a particular event, seating capacity, which reflects the possible number of tickets that can be sold for the event, is an important consideration.

==In restaurants==
The seating capacity for restaurants is reported as 'covers'; a restaurant that can seat 99 is said to have 99 covers.

==Legal capacity and total capacity==
Seating capacity differs from ''total capacity'' (sometimes called ''public capacity''), which describes the total [[number]] of people who can fit in a venue or in a [[vehicle]] either sitting or standing. Where seating capacity is a [[legal]] requirement, however, as it is in [[movie theatre]]s and on [[aircraft]], the law reflects the fact that the number of people allowed in should not exceed the number who can be seated.

Use of the term "public capacity" indicates that a venue is allowed to hold more people than it can actually seat. Again, the maximum total number of people can refer to either the physical space available or limitations set by law.

A '''sheriff officer''' is an officer of the Scottish [[sheriff court]], responsible for serving documents and enforcing [[court order]]s.

The [[jurisdiction]] of a sheriff officer is limited to the area of their commission (the relevant [[sheriffdom]] or [[Sheriff Court district]]), unlike [[messenger-at-arms|messengers-at-arms]] (the equivalent officers of the [[Court of Session]], who have jurisdiction throughout Scotland).  Both messengers-at-arms and sheriff officers are employed by private businesses and charge fees that are set by [[Act of Sederunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Act of Sederunt (Sheriff Court Ordinary Cause Rules) 1993 |url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/library/rules/ordinarycause/ordinary_cause_rules/Chapter%2005.doc |publisher=[[Scottish Court Service]] |accessdate=2007-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930123448/http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/library/rules/ordinarycause/ordinary_cause_rules/Chapter%2005.doc |archivedate=September 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Act of Sederunt (Fees of Sheriff Officers) 2004 :  {{cite web|title=Scottish Statutory Instrument 2004 No. 513 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2004/513/contents/made |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] | accessdate=2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheriff officers have been under the control of the local [[Sheriff#Scotland|Sheriff]] for centuries.  The office of sheriff officer is thought to be one of the oldest in the [[Scots law|Scottish legal system]], and may derive from the pre-feudal office of mair (an official who attended a sheriff for arrestment or executions).&lt;ref&gt;Messengers-at-Arms and Sheriff Officers:  {{cite web|title=Background |url=http://www.smaso.org/background.html |publisher=The Society of Messengers-at-Arms and Sheriff Officers | accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 60 of the [[Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Act 2007]] would have abolished the offices of messenger-at-arms and sheriff officer and replaced them by a new office of "judicial officer". Judicial officers would have held a commission from the [[Lord President of the Court of Session]] under section 57 of the Act, granted on the recommendation of a Scottish Civil Enforcement Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Act 2007:  {{cite web|title=Section 60 - Abolition of offices of messenger-at-arms and sheriff officer |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2007/3/part/3/crossheading/abolition-of-offices-of-messengeratarms-and-sheriff-officer |publisher=[[UK Statute Law Database]]| accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 30 January 2008 the Scottish Government announced as part of a package of public service reform that the Scottish Civil Enforcement Commission would not be established and that its functions would be discharged by existing organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/PublicServiceReform/simplifyingpublicservices/simplifyannexeB |title=Scottish Government website |publisher=Scotland.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provisions of the 2007 Act were not brought into force, and are to be repealed by the [[Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010, section 13 and Schedule 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, the Scottish Government issued a consultation on the designation of a professional organisation for officers of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/11/officersofcourt |title=Scottish Government consultation |publisher=Scotland.gov.uk |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Subject-matter jurisdiction''' is the authority of a [[court]] to hear cases of a particular type or cases relating to a specific subject matter.  For instance, bankruptcy court only has the authority to hear bankruptcy cases.

Subject-matter jurisdiction must be distinguished from [[personal jurisdiction]], which is the power of a court to render a judgment against a particular defendant, and [[territorial jurisdiction]], which is the power of the court to render a judgment concerning events that have occurred within a well-defined territory. Unlike personal or territorial jurisdiction, lack of subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived. A judgment from a court that did not have subject-matter jurisdiction is forever a nullity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhode Island vs. Massachusetts, 37 U.S. 657 (1838)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6577896363025029999|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=3 July 2017}} (“However late this objection has been made, or may be made in any cause, in an inferior or appellate court of the United States, it must be considered and decided, before any court can move one further step in the cause; as any movement is necessarily the exercise of jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine the subject matter in controversy between parties to a suit, to adjudicate or exercise any judicial power over them; the question is, whether on the case before a court, their action is judicial or extra-judicial; with or without the authority of law, to render a judgment or decree upon the rights of the litigant parties.”)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce v. United States, 474 F.2d 215 (3d Cir.1973)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=976528109182731737|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=3 July 2017}} ("Where there is no jurisdiction over the subject matter, there is, as well, no discretion to ignore that lack of jurisdiction.")&lt;/ref&gt; To decide a case, a court must have a combination of subject (''subjectam'') and either personal (''personam'') or territorial (''locum'') jurisdiction.

Subject-matter jurisdiction, personal or territorial jurisdiction, and adequate [[notice]] are the three most fundamental constitutional requirements for a valid judgment.

==State courts==
In the [[United States]], many state court systems are divided into divisions such as [[Criminal law|criminal]], [[civil law (common law)|civil law]], [[family court|family]], and [[probate]].  A court within any one of those divisions would lack subject-matter jurisdiction to hear a case regarding matters assigned to another division.  Most [[U.S. state]] court systems, however, include a [[superior court]] that has "general" jurisdiction; that is, it is competent to hear any case over which no other state court has [[exclusive jurisdiction]]. Because the United States federal courts have [[exclusive jurisdiction]] over a very small percentage of cases, such as [[copyright]] disputes, [[patent]] disputes, and [[United States bankruptcy court]] disputes, state courts have the authority to hear the vast majority of cases.

==U.S. federal courts==
Subject-matter jurisdiction is significantly more limited in [[United States federal courts]]. The maximal constitutional bounds of federal courts' subject-matter jurisdiction are defined by [[Article III of the United States Constitution|Article III Section 2]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Federal courts' actual subject-matter jurisdiction derives from Congressional enabling statutes, such as {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1330|1369}} and {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1441|1452}}. The [[United States Congress]] has not extended federal courts' subject-matter jurisdiction to its constitutional limits. For example, the [[amount-in-controversy]] requirement for [[diversity jurisdiction]] is based on {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1332}}, not a constitutional restriction. Moreover, Congress could constitutionally overrule the complete-diversity rule in diversity cases.

By far the most important two categories of federal subject-matter jurisdiction in non-criminal cases are [[federal question jurisdiction]] and diversity jurisdiction. The enabling statute for federal question jurisdiction, {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1331}}, provides that the district courts have original jurisdiction in ''all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States''. As mentioned before, this jurisdiction is ordinarily not exclusive; states too can hear claims based on federal law. The enabling statute for diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332, grants the district courts jurisdiction in an action that meets two basic conditions:

*''Complete diversity requirement''. No defendant is a citizen of the same state as any plaintiff.
*''Amount in controversy requirement''. The matter in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Federal courts also have [[removal jurisdiction]], which is the authority to try cases removed by defendants from state courts. The contours of removal jurisdiction are almost identical to those of original jurisdiction.

According to Rule 12(b)(1) of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], a federal court has the authority to dismiss a case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction upon motion of a party or ''[[sua sponte]]'', upon its own initiative.[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule12.htm]

In federal criminal cases (offenses against the laws of the United States), the federal district courts of the United States have subject matter jurisdiction granted under {{UnitedStatesCode|18|3231}}.

[[File:Fund Structure.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Structure of a private equity or hedge fund, which shows the carried interest and [[management fee]] received by the fund's investment managers. The [[general partner]] is the financial entity used to control and manage the fund, while the [[limited partner]]s are the individual investors who receive their return as [[capital gain|capital interest]].&lt;ref name=Fleischer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fleischer|first=Victor|title=Two and Twenty: Taxing Partnership Profits in Private Equity Funds|journal=New York University Law Review|date=2008|ssrn=892440|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Private equity]] funds and [[hedge fund]]s are private investment vehicles used to pool investment capital, usually for a small group of large institutional or wealthy individual investors.  They are subject to favorable regulatory treatment in most jurisdictions from which they are managed, which allows them to engage in financial activities that are off-limits for more regulated companies.  Both types of fund also take advantage of generally applicable rules in their jurisdictions to minimize the tax burden on their investors, as well as on the fund managers.  As media coverage increases regarding the growing influence of hedge funds and private equity, these tax rules are increasingly under scrutiny by legislative bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Knoll, ''Article: The Taxation of Private Equity Carried Interests: Estimating the Revenue Effects of taxing Profit Interests as Ordinary Income'', 50 WM. &amp; MARY L. REV. 115, 117 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  Private equity and hedge funds choose their structure depending on the individual circumstances of the investors the fund is designed to attract.

==Basic structure: U.S. domestic fund==
A private equity or hedge fund located in the [[United States]] will typically be structured as a [[limited partnership]], due to the lack of an entity-level tax on [[partnership]]s and other [[flow-through entity|flow-through entities]] under the [[Taxation in the United States|U.S. tax system]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally, subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, Title 26 of the U.S. Code.&lt;/ref&gt;  The limited partners will be the institutional and individual investors.  The general partner will be an affiliate of the manager of the fund.  Typically, the manager of the hedge fund is compensated with a fee based on 2% of the gross assets of the fund, and a profits interest entitling the manager (or, more typically, its affiliated general partner) to 20% of the fund's return (subject, in many cases, to minimum guaranteed returns for the limited partners).&lt;ref name=Marples&gt;{{cite news|last=Marples|first=Donald|title=Taxation of Hedge Fund and Private Equity  Managers|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS22689.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2014|newspaper=[[Congressional Research Service]]|date=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carried interest==
{{See also|Carried interest}}
Because the manager is compensated with a profits interest in the fund, the bulk of its income from the fund is taxed, not as compensation for services, but as a return on investment.  Typically, when a partner receives a profits interest (commonly referred to as a "carried interest"), the partner is not taxed upon receipt, due to the difficulty of ascertaining the present value of an interest in future profits.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Campbell v. United States (8th Cir. 1981).  This approach was adopted as a general administrative rule by the IRS in a notice in 1993, and again in proposed regulations in 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the partner is taxed as the partnership earns income.  In the case of a hedge fund, this means that the partner defers taxation on the income that the hedge fund earns, which is typically ordinary income (or possibly short-term capital gains), due to the nature of the investments most hedge funds make.  Private equity funds, however, typically invest on a longer horizon, with the result that
income earned by the funds is long-term capital gain, taxable to individuals at a maximum 20% rate.  Because the 20% profits share typically is the bulk of the manager’s compensation, and because this compensation can reach, in the case of the most successful funds, enormous figures, concern has been raised, both in Congress and in the media, that managers are taking advantage of tax loopholes to receive what is effectively a salary without paying the ordinary 39.6% marginal income tax rates that an average person would have to pay on such income.&lt;ref name=Marples/&gt;  To address this concern, Congressman [[Sander M. Levin]] introduced {{USBill|110|H.R.|2834}}, which would eliminate the ability of persons performing investment adviser or similar services to partnerships to receive capital gains tax treatment on their income. However, the Treasury Department has suggested, both in testimony before the Senate Finance
Committee&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.senate.gov/hearings/testimony/2007test/071107testes.pdf Microsoft Word - 07.11.07 TESTIMONY Solomon on Carried Interest.doc] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726015950/http://finance.senate.gov/hearings/testimony/2007test/071107testes.pdf |date=July 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in public speaking engagements,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last=Donmoyer |first=Ryan J. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=alm0Crt0eICY |title=News |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; that altering the tax treatment of a single industry raises tax policy concerns, and that changing the way partnerships in general are taxed is something that should only be done after careful consideration of the potential impact.

Congressman [[Charles B. Rangel]] included a revised version of H.R. 2834 as part of the "Mother of All Tax Reform" and the 2007 House extenders package. A line item on taxing carried interest at ordinary income rates was included in the Obama Administration's 2008 Budget Blueprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/asset.aspx?AssetId=793 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090227032520/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/fy2010_new_era/A_New_Era_of_Responsibility2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-02-27 |title=See page 122 of the White House version of "A New Era of Responsibility - Renewing America’s Promise" |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2009, Congressman Levin introduced a new and substantially revised version of the carried interest legislation as {{USBill|111|H.R.|1935}}. On May 28, 2010, the House approved carried interest legislation as part of amendments to the Senate-passed version of {{USBill|111|H.R.|4213}}.&lt;ref name=hr4016&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4016: Carried Interest Fairness Act of 2012|publisher=Democrats of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]]|url=http://democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/bill/hr-4016-carried-interest-fairness-act-2012|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234019/http://democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/bill/hr-4016-carried-interest-fairness-act-2012|archivedate=18 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 14, 2012, Congressman Levin introduced {{USBill|112|H.R.|4016}}.&lt;ref name=hr4016/&gt;

==Publicly traded partnerships==
In mid-2007, the Blackstone group, a major private equity fund, went public.  Ordinarily, a publicly traded partnership is taxed as a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 7704(a) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  There is, however, an exception for publicly traded partnerships earning only “passive-type” income, such as interest and dividends.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 7704(c) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the investments made by a private equity fund are actively managed, Blackstone took the position that the investments they engaged in fell squarely within literal language of this exception to the usual treatment for publicly traded partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donmoyer |first=Ryan J. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aLT1S7eAbIQg |title=News |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To address what they viewed as a loophole in the law, Senators Baucus and Grassley introduced S. 1624, which would remove the ability for publicly traded partnerships performing asset-management and related services to avoid being taxed as
corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:s1624is.txt.pdf |title=FDsys - Browse Congressional Bills |publisher=Frwebgate.access.gpo.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result of this bill would be to change the tax treatment of private equity and hedge funds from a single level of taxation at a 15% rate (or 35% in the case of most hedge funds) to a corporate-level tax of 35%, plus a 15% tax on dividends when distributed.  While acknowledging that there are concerns with the current treatment of publicly traded partnerships, Treasury Secretary Paulson has declined to endorse the treatment that would be provided under S. 1624.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The House extenders package included a carried interest provision that would apply to publicly traded partnerships beginning in tax years after 31 December 2009.

Various private equity and hedge fund managers followed Fortress, the first fund manager to go public as a PTP.  The funds include Oaktree, [[Blackstone Group]], [[Och-Ziff]], [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]], [[Apollo Global Management]], and [[Carlyle Group]].

=="Blocker" corporations==
{{Main|Blocker corporation}}
Although a partnership structure is advantageous for most investors due to the elimination of an entity-level tax, it is not the desired form for all investors.  In particular, foreign investors and domestic tax-exempt organizations both have reasons to prefer to interpose a corporation in the private equity or hedge fund structure.&lt;ref name=Marples/&gt;

Foreign investors are generally not required to file tax returns unless they have “effectively connected income,” derived from the active conduct of a U.S. trade or business.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 871 &amp; 881 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Passive investment in a corporation does not give rise to a U.S. trade or business.  However, active investment management of the type performed by private equity funds or hedge funds typically does.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 864 (2007) and regulations thereunder&lt;/ref&gt;  Because partners in a partnership are treated as engaged in whatever business the partnership itself is engaged in, this means that if a foreign investor invests in a hedge fund or private equity fund, it will generally be forced to file a U.S. tax return.  To avoid this requirement, a foreign investor will often invest through a [[blocker corporation]] (usually located in the Cayman Islands or another offshore jurisdiction).  The corporation itself will be required to file U.S. tax returns, and will pay taxes at the normal U.S.
corporate tax rate, but the foreign investor will receive only dividends or capital gains from the blocker, and will therefore not be required to file a U.S. return.  As an alternative to the “blocker” structure, hedge funds seeking to attract foreign investors can also structure as partnerships, but simply restrict themselves to activities that are not treated as a U.S. trade or business.  For example, U.S. tax law provides that trading in securities for the taxpayer’s own account will not constitute a U.S. trade or business.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 864(b) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus foreign hedge funds formed as corporations do not generally pay corporate income tax.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys T, Man A. (2006). [http://www.executiveview.com/knowledge_centre.php?id=1376 Introduction to US Tax Aspects of Hedge Fund Formation]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}. Morrison &amp; Foerster LLP.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic tax-exempt entities face similar concerns when investing in funds structured as partnerships.  While tax-exempt on income related to their tax-exempt purpose, tax exempt entities are required to file tax returns and pay income tax on “unrelated business taxable income,” commonly referred to as UBTI.  Because the activities of an entity structured as a partnership flow through to its investors, if the partnership receives income that would be UBTI in the hands of the tax-exempt investor, the investor is forced to file an income-tax return and pay unrelated business income tax. To avoid this requirement, tax exempt entities use offshore blocker corporations in much the same way foreign investors do.&lt;ref name=Marples/&gt;  To date, no bill has been introduced to change this treatment, although concerns over the tax gap have led to increased scrutiny of business structures involving offshore corporations in general. For example, in May 2007, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing about offshore structures
used for tax evasion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.senate.gov/sitepages/hearing050307.htm Finance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627180810/http://finance.senate.gov/sitepages/hearing050307.htm |date=June 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Terrorist Bombings Convention''' (formally the '''International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings''') is a 1997 United Nations [[Multilateral treaty|treaty]] designed to criminalize terrorist bombings.

The convention describes terrorist bombings as the unlawful and intentional use of [[explosives]] in public places with intention to kill, to [[injury|injure]], or to cause extensive destruction to compel a government or an [[international organization]] to do or to abstain from doing some act.

The convention also seeks to promote police and judicial co-operation to prevent, investigate and [[punish]] those acts.

As of September 2018, the convention has been ratified by 170 states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVIII-9&amp;chapter=18&amp;lang=en Ratifications].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tacna–Arica compromise''' or '''Treaty of Lima''' was a series of documents that settled the territorial dispute of both [[Tacna Region|Tacna]] and [[Arica Province|Arica]] provinces of [[Peru]] and [[Chile]] respectively. According to the Treaty, the Tacna-Arica Territory was divided between both countries; Tacna being awarded to Peru and with Chile retaining sovereignty over Arica. Chile also agreed to pay up to 6 million dollars in compensation to Peru.

The Treaty was signed on June 3, 1929, in the city of [[Lima]] by then Peruvian Representative [[Pedro José Rada y Gamio]] and Chilean Representative [[Emiliano Figueroa Larrain]].

The controversy was a direct aftermath of the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883), a confrontation that involved [[Chile]] against [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]]. Chile won the war and conquered the Peruvian territories of [[Tarapacá Region|Tarapacá]], Tacna and Arica. The defeated Peruvian government was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Ancón]] in 1883.

In this Treaty, Tarapacá was annexed to Chile.  However, the fate of both Tacna and Arica was to be decided by a plebiscite to be held in 1893.  Due to different points of view, both countries were not able to agree on the conditions of this plebiscite.  So, it was not held.  Then Chile began to colonize the two territories in 1909.  Peru followed in 1911 with a break of diplomatic relations.  In 1922, Chile and Peru agreed to arbitrate the dispute with the President of the United States.  President [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge]] appointed, in 1925, the first US arbitrator, General [[John J. Pershing]]; General [[William Lassiter]] followed in 1926.  Neither negotiator was able to break the deadlock.  US Secretary of State [[Frank B. Kellogg]] suggested direct negotiations in Washington, D.C. in 1928.  It was these negotiations that led to the '''Treaty of Lima (1929)'''.

The deal that was finally reached allowed Peru to reacquire Tacna while Chile kept Arica. Chile had also to make some concessions such as building a Peruvian-administered wharf in Arica and pay a six million-[[U.S. dollar|dollar]] indemnification, among other provisions. In 1999, Chile and Peru at last agreed to fully implement the Treaty of Lima, providing Peru with access to port facilities in [[Arica]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominguez, Jorge ''et al.''

According to the '''Treaty of Vienna''' signed on 12 October 1866, the [[Austrian Empire]] ceded [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] and [[Mantua]] to the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]], which in turn would cede them to the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] in exchange for the earlier Italian acquiescence to the French annexation of [[Savoy]] and [[Nice]], under the reservation of the "consent of the people duly consulted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/amonographonple03wambgoog/amonographonple03wambgoog_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "A Monograph on Plebiscites: With a Collection of Official Documants" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represented the final division of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]], as [[Lombardy]] had been ceded to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] by the [[Treaty of Zurich]] in 1859.

{{Environmental law}}
[[War]] can heavily damage the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], and warring countries often place operational requirements ahead of environmental concerns for the duration of the war. Some [[international law]] is designed to limit this environmental harm.

==Environmental impact of war==
{{main|Environmental issues with war}}
War and military activities have obvious detrimental impacts on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthtrends.wri.org/features/view_feature.php?fid=43&amp;theme=10 World Resources Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Weaponry, troop movements, [[land mine]]s, creation and destruction of buildings, destruction of forests by defoliation or general military usage, poisoning of water sources, target-shooting of animals for practice, consumption of endangered species out of desperation etc., are just some of the examples of how both war and peacetime military activities (such as training, base construction, and transportation of weaponry) harm the environment.

==Law==

From a legal standpoint, environmental protection during times of war and military activities is addressed partially by [[international environmental law]].  Further sources are also found in areas of law such as general international law, the [[laws of war]], [[human rights law]] and local laws of each affected country.  However, this article is chiefly focused on the environment and as soon as two countries are battling it out, the issue becomes one of international concern. Thus, international environmental law that the [[United Nations Security Council]] enforces is the focus here.

The [[law of armed conflict]] is not very well developed in comparison to other areas of international law.  Only the [[United Nations Security Council]] has the [[authority]] and the [[jurisdiction]] to regulate its development and implementation, or to monitor its observance.

==UN treaties==

Several [[United Nations]] treaties, including the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], the 1972 [[World Heritage Convention]] and the 1977 [[Environmental Modification Convention]] have provisions to limit the environmental impacts of war or military activities.

===1977 Environmental Modification Convention===
The [[Environmental Modification Convention]]is an international treaty prohibiting the military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects. The Convention bans weather warfare, which is the use of weather modification techniques for the purposes of inducing damage or destruction. This treaty is in force and has been ratified (accepted as binding) by leading military powers

===Proposed Fifth Geneva Convention===

Attempts have been made to get a specific Geneva convention dealing with protection of the environment during times of armed conflict but so far this has not been successful.

==Customary international law==

[[Customary international law]] also has something to say about protection of the environment during times of armed conflict and military activities.

*Under the Rio Declaration, Principle 24 provides:

"States shall ... respect international law providing protection for the environment in times of armed conflict and cooperate in its further development, as necessary."

*UN General Assembly Resolution 47/37 (1992) provides:&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/envir.htm UN General Assembly Resolution 47/37 (1992)]&lt;/ref&gt;

"[D]estruction of the environment not justified by military necessity and carried out wantonly is clearly contrary to existing international law."

===Thermonuclear war===
The [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons]] considered the environment as a minor issue in regard to the legality of thermonuclear war but it did not find all [[thermonuclear war]] to be prohibited.

==Other sources==

*The ILC has a Code of Offences Against the Peace and Security of Mankind.

==Organisations==

The international organisations with environmental mandates may be called upon during times of armed conflict to assist with mediating or remedying damage caused by armed conflict.  Such agencies as the [[UN Environment Programme]], the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[International Maritime Organization]] will be of relevance here.  The [[UN Security Council]] has also demonstrated environmental concern in deliberations on recent conflicts, for example, during the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. [[UNEP]] and IMO were also involved in this conflict, attempting to remedy the most serious of the environmental impacts.

*UNEP
*IMO
*[[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO)
*WHO
*[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng International Committee of the Red Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Webster–Ashburton Treaty''', signed August 9, 1842, was a treaty that resolved several border issues between the United States and the [[Canada under British Imperial control (1764–1867)|British North American colonies]] (the region that became Canada). Signed under [[John Tyler]]'s presidency, it resolved the [[Aroostook War]], a nonviolent dispute over the location of the [[History of Maine|Maine]]–[[History of New Brunswick|New Brunswick]] border. It:

* Established the border between Lake Superior and the [[Lake of the Woods]], originally defined in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783
* Reaffirmed the location of the border (at the 49th parallel) in the westward frontier up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] defined in the [[Treaty of 1818]]
* Defined seven crimes subject to extradition
* Called for a final end to the [[slave trade]] on the high seas
* Agreed that the two parties would share use of the [[Great Lakes]]
The treaty retroactively confirmed the southern boundary of Quebec that land surveyors [[Collins–Valentine line|John Collins and Thomas Valentine]] had marked with stone monuments in 1771–1773. The treaty intended that the border be at 45 degrees north latitude, but is in some places nearly a half mile north of the parallel. The treaty was signed by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Daniel Webster]] and British diplomat [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton]].&lt;ref name="Francis M. Carroll 2001"&gt;{{harvp|Carroll|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the East==
[[File:Webster-Ashburton treaty map-fr.svg|thumb|Settlement in the East. The disputed area is shown in gray and the boundary established by the treaty in green.]]
An arbitration of various border issues in the East before King [[William I of the Netherlands]] in 1831 had failed to yield a binding decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision of the Arbiter, January 1831|url=http://www.upperstjohn.com/history/1831Arbitration.htm|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treaty of Paris had established the 45th parallel as part of the northern boundary of modern-day New York and Vermont. Most of that portion of the boundary had previously been surveyed in the early 1770s, but the survey line was inaccurate. Since "[[Fort Blunder]]"—an unnamed U.S. fort in what is now part of northeastern New York—had been constructed north of the actual 45th parallel, the United States wanted to follow the old survey line, and the Webster–Ashburton treaty incorporated this change, leaving the half-finished fort on U.S. soil. Following signing of the treaty, the U.S. resumed construction on the site. The new project replaced the aborted 1812-era construction with a massive [[Seacoast defense in the United States#Third System|third-system]] masonry fortification known as [[Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)|Fort Montgomery]].&lt;ref name="Francis M. Carroll 2001"/&gt;

This treaty marked the end of local confrontations between lumberjacks  (known as the [[Aroostook War]]) along the Maine border with the British colonies of Lower Canada (which later became Quebec) and New Brunswick. The newly agreed border divided the disputed territory between the two nations. The British were assigned the Halifax–Quebec road route, which their military desired because Lower Canada had no other connection in winter to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The treaty adjusted portions of the border to give the United States a little more land to the north. It also resolved issues that had led to the [[Republic of Indian Stream|Indian Stream dispute]] as well as the [[Caroline Affair|''Caroline'' Affair]]. The Indian Stream area was assigned to the United States. The Webster–Ashburton Treaty failed to clarify ownership of [[Machias Seal Island]] and nearby [[North Rock]], which remain in dispute today.&lt;ref name="Francis M. Carroll 2001"/&gt; Additionally, the signing of the treaty put an end to several building improvements planned for Upper Canadian defense forts such as [[Fort Malden]] in [[Amherstburg]], which the British government later abandoned, as they no longer served a defensive purpose.

==In the West==
[[Image:Webster-Ashburton Treaty.jpg|thumb|Plaque in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The border between Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods needed clarification because the faulty [[Mitchell Map]] used in the negotiations for the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was inadequate to define the border according to the terms of that treaty. Ambiguity in the map and treaty resulted in Minnesota's [[Arrowhead region]] being disputed, and previous negotiations had not resolved the question. The treaty had the border pass through Long Lake, but did not state that lake's location.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lass|1980|pp= 1, 11, 37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the map showed the lake flowing into Lake Superior near [[Isle Royale]], which is consistent with the Pigeon River route.

The British, however, had previously taken the position that the border should leave Lake Superior at ''Fond du Lac'' (the "head of the lake") in modern [[Duluth, Minnesota]], proceed up the [[Saint Louis River|Saint Louis]] and [[Embarrass River (Minnesota)|Embarrass]] rivers, across the [[Drainage divide|height of land]], and down Pike River and [[Lake Vermilion]] to the [[Rainy River (Minnesota–Ontario)|Rainy River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lass|1980|pp=37–39, 49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vogel|Stanley|1992|pp=E-12, E-13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter this western route, the U.S. advocated for an eastern route, used by early French explorer [[Jacques de Noyon]] in 1688, and the later a well-used fur traders' route after 1802.  This way headed north from the lake at the site of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] up the [[Kaministiquia River|Kaministiquia]] and Dog Rivers to Cold Water Lake, crossed the divide by Prairie Portage to Height of Land Lake, then went west by way of the Savanne, Pickerel, and Maligne rivers to Lake La Croix, where it joined the present border.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lass|1980|pp=37–39, 44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mitchell map had shown both of those routes, and also showed the "Long Lake" route between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lass|1980|p= 37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Long Lake was thought to be the [[Pigeon River (Minnesota–Ontario)|Pigeon River]] (despite the absence of a lake at its mouth).{{efn|On the [[:File:La Vérendrye Map.jpg|La Vérendrye Map]], series of lakes are shown, of which "Lac de Sesakinaga" ([[Saganaga Lake]]), a Height of Land, "Lac Plat", "Lac Long" and Grand Portage are shown in relative equidistance from each other, thus alluding to Mountain Lake or Arrow Lake as "Lac Long", all long lakes on the Pigeon River route.}}

The traditional traders' route left the Lake at [[Grand Portage]] and went overland to the Pigeon, up that river and a tributary across the [[Height of Land Portage]], and thence down tributaries of the Rainy River to [[Lac La Croix]], Rainy Lake and River, and [[Lake of the Woods]]. This is finally the route the treaty designated as the border.&lt;ref name=Art2&gt;{{cite web | title = Webster–Ashburton Treaty, Art. 2 | publisher = Yale Law School | year = 1842 | url = http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/britain/br-1842.htm#art2 | accessdate = September 18, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060825042901/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/britain/br-1842.htm#art2 | archivedate = August 25, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty clarified the channel that the border would follow between Lake Huron and Lake Superior, awarding [[Sugar Island (Michigan)|Sugar Island]] to the U.S.

Another clarification made in this treaty resulted in clarifying the anomaly of the [[Northwest Angle]]. Again, due to errors on the Mitchell Map, Treaty of Paris reads "... through the Lake of the Woods to the most northwesternmost point thereof, and from thence on a due west course to the river Mississippi ..." In fact, a course due west from the Lake of the Woods never intersects the Mississippi. The [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]] defined the boundary about Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains.

This 1842 treaty reaffirmed the border and further defined it by modifying the border definition to instead read as: 

{{quote|... at the Chaudiere Falls, from which the Commissioners traced the line to the most northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods, thence, along the said line to the said most northwestern point, being in latitude 49°23′55″ north, and in longitude 95°14′38″ west from the Observatory at Greenwich; thence, according to existing treaties, due south to its intersection with the 49th parallel of north latitude, and along that parallel to the Rocky Mountains ...}}

The Webster–Ashburton Treaty failed to deal with the [[Oregon boundary dispute|Oregon question]], although the issue was discussed in negotiations.

==Other issues==
Article 10 of the Webster–Ashburton Treaty identified seven crimes subject to extradition: "murder, or assault with intent to commit murder, or piracy, or arson, or robbery, or forgery, or the utterance of forged paper." It did not include slave revolt or mutiny. In addition, the United States did not press for the return or extradition of an estimated 12,000 fugitive slaves who had reached Canada.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{harvp|Jones|1975a|pages= 28–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While agreeing to call for a final end to the [[slave trade]] on the high seas, Webster and Ashburton agreed to pass over the [[Creole case]] of 1841 in the Caribbean, which was then in contention. In November 1841, a [[slave revolt]] on the American brig ''Creole,'' part of the [[coastwise slave trade]], had forced the ship to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]. Bahama officials eventually emancipated all 128 slaves who chose to stay in Nassau, as Britain had abolished slavery in its colonies, effective in 1834.&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; The U.S. initially demanded return of the slaves, then compensation. A settlement was made in 1855 as part of a much larger claims treaty of 1853, covering claims by both nations to 1814.

==Results==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
[[File:MaineBoundaryDispute.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Maine boundary dispute that led to the 1842 Webster–Ashburton Treaty]]
As a result of the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, the United States ceded {{convert|5,000|sqmi|km2}} of disputed territory along the Maine border, including the Halifax–Quebec Route, but kept {{convert|7,000|sqmi|km2}} of  the disputed wilderness.&lt;ref name="pageant"&gt;{{harvp|Kennedy|Bailey|Cohen|2006|pages= 374, 375}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the United States received {{convert|6,500|sqmi|km2}} of land along the Minnesota–Canada border, which included the [[Mesabi Range]].&lt;ref name="pageant"/&gt; Shortly after ratification of the Webster–Ashburton treaty, the [[Ojibwa]] nations about the south shore of Lake Superior ceded land to the United States in the [[Treaty of La Pointe]]. However, the news of the ratification of the international treaty did not reach either of the parties negotiating the land cession. The [[Grand Portage Band]] was mistakenly omitted from the Ojibwe treaty council. In addition, the Grand Portage Band was misinformed on the details of the Treaty of Paris; they believed that the border passed through the center of Lake Superior to the Saint Louis River, placing both Isle Royale and their band in British territory.  The Treaty of Paris specifically notes Isle Royale as in the territories of the United States. Consequently, the [[Isle Royale Agreement]] was signed between the United States and the Grand Portage Band in 1844 as an adhesion to the Treaty of La Pointe, with other Ojibwa tribes reaffirming the treaty.

Ten months of negotiations for the treaty were held largely at the [[Ashburton House]], home of the British legation on [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]] in Washington, D.C.  The house has been designated a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]].

To make the controversial treaty more popular in the United States, Webster released a map of the Maine–Canada border, which he claimed [[Benjamin Franklin]] had drawn. It showed contested areas largely resolved in favor of the United States.

{{Prerogative writs}}
A '''writ of prohibition''' is a [[writ]] directing a subordinate to stop doing something the law prohibits.  In practice, the court directs the clerk to issue the writ, and directs the [[sheriff]] to serve it on the subordinate, and the [[clerk]] prepares the writ and gives it to the sheriff, who serves it. This writ is often issued by a superior court to the lower court asking it not to proceed with a case which does not fall under its jurisdiction.

These writs are issued as "alternative" or "peremptory".  An alternative writ directs the recipient to immediately act, or desist, and "show cause" why the directive should not be made permanent. A peremptory writ directs the recipient to immediately act, or desist, and "return" the writ, with certification of its compliance, within a certain time.

When an agency of an official body is the target of the writ of prohibition, the writ is directed to the official body over which the court has direct jurisdiction, ordering the official body to cause the agency to desist.

Although the rest of this article speaks to judicial processes, a writ of prohibition may be directed by any court of record (i.e., higher than a [[misdemeanor]] court) toward any official body, whether a court or a county, city or town government, that is within the court's jurisdiction.

==In the United States==
A "writ of prohibition", in the [[United States]], is an official legal document drafted and issued by a [[supreme court]], [[superior court]] or an [[appeals court]] to a [[judge]] presiding over a suit in an inferior court.  The writ of prohibition mandates the inferior court to cease any action over the case because it may not fall within that inferior court's [[jurisdiction]].  The document is also issued at times when it is deemed that an inferior court is acting outside the normal rules and procedures in the examination of a case.  In another instance, the document is issued at times when an inferior court is deemed headed towards defeating a legal right.

In criminal proceedings, a defendant who has been committed for trial may petition to the superior court for a writ of prohibition, in this case on the ground that his conduct, even if proven, does not constitute the offense charged.

Prohibition is more often used by appellate courts.  Most often, these courts issue writs of prohibition to prevent lower courts from exceeding their jurisdiction. In some cases, this writ may also be used to prevent an inferior court from acting contrary to the rules of natural justice. The writ of prohibition may not be used to undo any previous acts, but only to prohibit acts not completed.

"Thus it was held that notwithstanding the right to an appeal, if the situation disclosed be such that to take the ordinary course by appeal would&lt;!-- OK here: don't correct it--&gt; of itself subject the complainant to irreparable loss, the writ should issue notwithstanding no objection was made below; that the matter of judicial courtesy should yield to substantial personal rights of litigants, such as a sacrifice of their liberty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marysadvocates.org/ohiocase/writofmandamus.html |title=Complaint to Ohio Supreme Court Sept. 2007 |publisher=Marysadvocates.org |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writs of prohibition are similar to [[writs of certiorari]], as both types of writs allow superior courts to manage inferior courts. However, unlike a writ of prohibition, superior courts issue writs of certiorari to review decisions which inferior courts have already made.

==In India==
A writ of prohibition is issued primarily to prevent an inferior court or [[tribunal]] from exceeding its [[jurisdiction]] in cases pending before it or acting contrary to the rules of natural justice. It is issued by a superior court to inferior courts from usurping a jurisdiction with which it was not legally vested, or in other words to compel inferior courts to keep within the limits of their jurisdiction. Thus the writ is issued in both cases where there is excess of jurisdiction and where there is absence of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;S. Govind Menon vs. union of India, AIR 1967 SC 1274.&lt;/ref&gt; Prohibition is not a continuation of the proceedings to be prohibited. Its object is on the contrary to arrest the inferior tribunal's proceedings. It is a collateral matter progress essentially between the two tribunals, an inferior one and other superior one by which the latter, by virtue its power of superintendence over the former, restrains it within its rightful competence. Its nature is held to depend upon the nature of proceeding to be prohibited. The writ can be issued only when the proceedings are pending in a court if the proceeding has matured into decision, writ will not lie. When the court, before whom the matter is pending, has ceased to exist, in that condition too, the writ of prohibition will not lie because there can be no proceedings upon which it can operate but on the other hand, if the court is functioning, the writ can be issued at any stage of the proceeding before the inferior court or tribunal. It can be issued only against a judicial and quasi-judicial bodyand not against a legislative or administrative body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Indian Polity |edition=3rd |author=M Laxmikanth |page=no.7.21 |ISBN=978-0-07-015316-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In English legal history==
The writs of prohibition were the main means by which the managing common law courts, the King's Bench and Common Pleas, restricted other courts from overstepping their jurisdictional boundaries.{{sfn |Gray The writ of prohibition |page=vii}} The writs originally functioned like administrative orders, though over time they acquired the power of legal commands.{{sfn|Plucknett A Concise History of the Common Law |page=173}} Writs could be issued against another court or an individual defendant, somewhat similar to the way an injunction works in courts today.{{sfn|Raack A History of Injunctions |page=546}} The writs of Prohibition were primarily used against the ecclesiastical courts. However, they were also used against the equity courts, admiralty courts, and local courts.{{sfn |Gray The writ of prohibition |page=viii}}{{sfn|Plucknett A Concise History of the Common Law |page=395}} The highest of the equity courts was the Chancery, but although as a fact of law the Chancery could be prohibited, it rarely, if ever, was.{{sfn|Gray Boundaries of the Equitable Function |page=197}}

Not obeying a writ could result in imprisonment, fine, or possible damages in favor of the opposing party.{{sfn|Helmholz Writs of Prohibition and Ecclesiastical Sanctions |page=1012}}

The rise in the use of writs of prohibition accompanied the consolidation of power in the English monarchy and the growth of the court system in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The Angevin kings, who split their time between England and France, needed strong and competent advisors to help run the government in England when they were gone. The growth of the royal bureaucracy accompanied the codification of much of the existing common law with the [[Statute of Westminster 1275|First Statute of Westminster (1275)]], which was passed during Edward I's reign. The common law courts and legal interpretation by common law judges began to become more formalized as judges moved from the role of primary lawmakers to the interpreters of statutes.{{sfn|Plucknett Statutes and Their Interpretation |page=55}} While the earlier courts had had more flexibility to provide both legal and equitable relief, over the period from the late thirteenth century to the end of the fourteenth century, the consideration of equity gradually disappeared in common law courts, which was one of the reasons the Chancery, which existed before to keep the King’s Great Seal and stamp it on public documents, emerged as a separate judicial court.{{sfn|Raack A History of Injunctions |pages=550-2}} As the common law courts became more formalized and rigid in their procedure and jurisprudence, they also ceased using the writ of prohibition as a remedy against individual defendants.{{sfn|Raack A History of Injunctions |page=554}}

There were occasional disputes among the courts when there were disagreements about what court was the proper place to hear a certain issue. For example, the ecclesiastical courts claimed they had the right to enforce contracts that were formalized by oath, as they involved a spiritual matter of whether the oath had properly been made, though common lawyers disagreed.{{sfn|Helmholz Writs of Prohibition and Ecclesiastical Sanctions |page=1011}} In some instances, however, the non-common law courts were able to provide relief where the common law courts could not. The Chancery, unlike the common law court, could provide remedies in cases involving trusts and uses and could give relief based on fraud, accident, or mistake to plaintiffs.{{sfn|Raack A History of Injunctions |page=555}} As courts of equity provided new relief that before had been encompassed by but limited in the common law courts, writs of prohibition helped prevent plaintiffs from being able to "[[Forum shopping|forum shop]]" for the court that would be most favorable to their position. Any plaintiff who could gain adequate relief in a common law court was prohibited from bringing his case in a different court, even if he preferred the procedure, allowable defenses, or possible remedies of a different court.

The use of the writ of prohibition also varied with the relationship between the Chancery and the common law judges. While at the beginning of the transformation of the Chancery into a judicial body, the common law judges often cooperated in helping the new court decide cases or even referred plaintiffs who had equitable claims.{{sfn|Raack A History of Injunctions |page=558}} Over time, however, the relationship declined as plaintiffs chose to seek relief in the Chancery, which was the fourth most popular major court by 1450.{{sfn|Raack A History of Injunctions |page=554}} In the first half of the fifteenth century, litigants chose to bring their cases there because, despite its growing popularity, the Chancery still saw many fewer cases than the common law court, which allowed cases to be resolved more quickly than in the common law courts, which were known for being slow.{{sfn|Raack A History of Injunctions |page=554}} Additionally, the Chancery allowed testimony of interested parties and witnesses and could compel discovery and specific relief, which the common law courts could not.{{sfn|Raack A History of Injunctions |page=554}}

===Procedure for securing a writ of prohibition ===
In the 13th century, the writs of prohibition were issued by the Chancery.{{sfn|Helmholz Writs of Prohibition and Ecclesiastical Sanctions |page=395}} However, by the later half of the 16th century, the writs of prohibition had become a judicial writ. That meant that if a party wanted to halt proceedings in another court on the grounds that the presiding court did not have proper jurisdictional authority, the party would petition the managing courts to do one of the following things: (1) eliminate liability altogether by applying common law, (2) have the case be sued ''de novo'' at common law, or (3) secure trial by the common law method of a jury or judicial ruling.{{sfn |Gray The writ of prohibition |page=xix}} Prior to deciding whether or not to grant the writ, the managing court would usually allow for open-court debate between the plaintiff seeking prohibition, the defendant opposing prohibition, and/or the judges themselves. However, writs of prohibition could be granted without such debate.{{sfn |Gray The writ of prohibition |page=xxi}}

===Contesting a writ of prohibition ===
If a party wanted to contest the granting of a writ of prohibition, they could do so in two ways. The first was a contempt proceeding called the "Attachment on Prohibition", wherein the plaintiff and defendant would plead before the managing court on the validity of the writ.{{sfn |Gray The writ of prohibition |page=xxii}} Alternatively, the parties could seek to reverse the writ of prohibition by seeking a writ of Consultation.

As writs of prohibition were rather easy to obtain, in the late thirteenth century, writs of Consultation came into use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Robert Wright |title=The Church and the English Crown 1305-1334 |year=1980 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=HbxmAAAAMAAJ |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a prohibited party or judge felt that a case rightly fell within the prohibited court's jurisdiction, they could question its appropriateness before the Chancellor. If the Chancellor agreed, he could issue a writ of Consultation, reversing the writ of prohibition and allowing the case to continue in the ecclesiastical court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert C. Palmer |title=Selling the Church: The English Parish in Law, Commerce, and Religion, 1350-1550 |year=2002 |pages=22-3 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=dXR1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justifications for writs of prohibition ===
In addition to threatening the king's authority, the existence of jurisdictional overlap jeopardized the uniformity of legal remedies by allowing for forum-shopping. For example, both the king and the Church claimed jurisdiction over disputes between executors and debtors and between creditors and executors. In the Church's eyes, the right of the executor to collect debts from a decedent's debtors and the right of creditors to enforce theirs claims against a decedent’s estate were "a proper part of probate administration".{{sfn|Helmholz Writs of Prohibition and Ecclesiastical Sanctions |page=1016}} Thus, while for most obligations a testator would have to sue under common law, an executor or creditor could choose between initiating a proceeding in a secular or ecclesiastical court. By issuing a writ of prohibition restraining executors or creditors from suing in an ecclesiastical court, this inequitable disparity in forum options could be resolved.{{sfn|Helmholz Writs of Prohibition and Ecclesiastical Sanctions |page=1017}}
