[[File:Original Act of Independence of Lithuania hand-written in Lithuanian language.jpg|thumb|right|The original hand-written Act of Independence of Lithuania with twenty original signatures of signatories]]
[[File:Nepriklausomybes aktas.gif|thumb|right|Facsimile of the Act of 16 February]]
The '''Act of Reinstating Independence of Lithuania''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos Valstybės atkūrimo aktas}}) or '''Act of 16 February''' was signed by the [[Council of Lithuania]] on 16 February 1918, proclaiming the restoration of an independent State of [[Lithuania]], governed by [[democracy|democratic]] principles, with [[Vilnius]] as its capital. The Act was signed by all [[Signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania|twenty representatives]] of the Council, which was chaired by [[Jonas Basanavičius]]. The Act of 16 February was the result of a series of resolutions on the issue, including one issued by the [[Vilnius Conference]] and the Act of 8 January. The path to the Act was long and complex because the [[German Empire]] exerted pressure on the Council to form an alliance. The Council had to carefully maneuver between the Germans, whose troops were present in Lithuania, and the demands of the Lithuanian people.

The immediate effects of the announcement of Lithuania's re-establishment of independence were limited. Publication of the Act was prohibited by the German authorities, and the text was distributed and printed illegally. The work of the Council was hindered, and Germans remained in control over Lithuania.&lt;ref name=el /&gt; The situation changed only when Germany lost [[World War I]] in the fall of 1918. In November 1918 the first Cabinet of Lithuania was formed, and the Council of Lithuania gained control over the territory of Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Vytas Stanley |last=Vardys |author2=Judith B. Sedaitis |title=Lithuania: The Rebel Nation |publisher=[[Westview Press]] |location=[[Boulder, CO]] |year=1997 |series=Westview Series on the Post-Soviet Republics |isbn=0-8133-1839-4 |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent Lithuania, although it would soon be battling the [[Lithuanian Wars of Independence|Wars of Independence]], became a reality.

The laconic Act is the legal basis for the existence of modern Lithuania, both during the [[interwar period]] and since 1990.&lt;ref name=maks /&gt; The Act formulated the basic constitutional principles that were and still are followed by all [[Constitution of Lithuania|Constitutions of Lithuania]]. The Act itself was a key element in the foundation of Lithuania's [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|re-establishment of independence in 1990]].&lt;ref name=VAR /&gt; Lithuania, breaking away from the [[Soviet Union]], stressed that it was simply re-establishing the independent state that existed between the world wars and that the Act never lost its legal power.&lt;ref name=LRS /&gt;

On 29 March 2017, the original document was found at the Diplomatic archive in Berlin, Germany.

==Historic background and Council of Lithuania==
Lithuania had a centuries long tradition of statehood following the coronation of [[Mindaugas]] the [[King of Lithuania]].

After the last [[partitions of Poland|Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1795, Lithuania was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grenoble |first=Lenore |title=Language Policy in the Soviet Union |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn3xDTiL0PQC&amp;pg=PA104 |year=2003 |volume=3 |series=Language policy |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |location=Dordrecht |pages=104 |isbn=1-4020-1298-5 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617163656/https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn3xDTiL0PQC&amp;pg=PA104 |archivedate=2016-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, both the Lithuanians and the [[Poland|Poles]] attempted to restore their independence. Lithuanians rebelled during the 1830 [[November Uprising]] and the 1863 [[January Uprising]], but their first real opportunity arose when both Russia and Germany were weakened during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Nicolson2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Nicolson|title=Longman Companion to the First World War: Europe 1914–1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttQFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA239|date=15 July 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-88826-0|page=239|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611022049/https://books.google.com/books?id=ttQFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA239|archivedate=11 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, Germany occupied western parts of the [[Russian Empire]]. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] in 1917, Germany conceived the geopolitical strategy of [[Mitteleuropa]] – a regional network of [[puppet state]]s that would serve as a buffer zone – and agreed to allow the [[Vilnius Conference]], hoping that it would proclaim that the Lithuanian nation wanted to detach itself from Russia and establish a closer relationship with Germany.&lt;ref name=el&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor = Simas Sužiedėlis | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title = Council of Lithuania | year = 1970–1978 | publisher = Juozas Kapočius | volume = I | location = Boston, Massachusetts | id = {{LCC|74-114275}} | pages = 581–585}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this strategy backfired; the conference, held on 18–22 September 1917, adopted a resolution that an independent Lithuania should be established and that a closer relationship with Germany would be conditional on Germany's formal recognition of the new state.&lt;ref name=Lina&gt;{{cite book |last= Kulikauskienė |first= Lina |chapter= 1917 metų Lietuvos Taryba |title=Gimtoji istorija.

==Path to the Act of 16 February==

===Act of 11 December===
The Act of 11 December was the second stage in the progression towards the final Act of Independence. The first draft, demanded by chancellor [[Georg von Hertling]], was prepared by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 1.&lt;ref name=eidintas /&gt; Further changes were jointly prepared by the German chancellery and by a delegation of the Council of Lithuania. The delegation's members were [[Antanas Smetona]], [[Steponas Kairys]], [[Vladas Mironas]], [[Jurgis Šaulys]], [[Petras Klimas]] and [[Aleksandras Stulginskis]].&lt;ref name=Raimundas&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=5&amp;id=8e57bf2c-f20c-494d-8b04-9bfedd6a3fbd |title=Vasario 16-osios aktas: teksto formavimo šaltiniai ir autorystės problema |first=Raimundas |last=Klimavičius |journal=Istorija.

The German representative, Kurt von Lersner, insisted that not one word be changed in the agreed-upon text and that all the Council members sign the document.&lt;ref name=Raimundas /&gt;

After the delegation returned to Vilnius, a session of the Council was held on 11 December in order to discuss the Act. It was adopted without any further changes. Fifteen voted in favor of the Act, three voted against it, one member abstained, and one did not participate.&lt;ref name=Raimundas /&gt; It is not entirely clear whether every member of the Council signed this document.&lt;ref name=Raimundas /&gt; The Act was written in [[German language|German]], and apparently no official Lithuanian translation was prepared. Therefore, different sources provide slightly different translations.&lt;ref name=Raimundas /&gt; The Act of 11 December pronounced Lithuania's independence, but also asked German government for protection (clause 2) and called for "a firm and permanent alliance" with Germany.&lt;ref name=Lina /&gt; Since the Act specified that the alliance was to be formed based on conventions concerning military affairs, transportation, customs, and currency, many Lithuanians argued that the Council had overstepped its authority: the September resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference clearly demanded that a constituent assembly decide these crucial matters of state.&lt;ref name=eidintas /&gt;

===Act of 8 January===
[[File:Jonas Basanavicius (1851-1927).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jonas Basanavičius]], the chairman of the Council when the Act of 16 February was signed]]
When peace talks started between Germany and Russia in 1918, German authorities asked the [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] representatives to prepare two notifications of independence—one for Russia, in which Lithuania's ties with Russia would be denounced and nothing would be mentioned about an alliance with Germany, and a version to be released in Germany that would essentially repeat the Act of 11 December.&lt;ref name=Raimundas /&gt; The Council decided to amend the first part of the Act of 11 December. [[Petras Klimas]] included a sentence calling for the Constituent Assembly.&lt;ref name=Skirius&gt;{{cite book |last=Skirius|first=Juozas |chapterurl=http://mkp.emokykla.lt/gimtoji/?id=1012 |accessdate=2007-01-27 |chapter=Lietuvos nepriklausomybės akto paskelbimas |title=Gimtoji istorija. Nuo 7 iki 12 klasės | year=2002| location=Vilnius |publisher=Elektroninės leidybos namai |isbn=9986-9216-9-4|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important development was the statement that democratic principles would be the basis of the new state's governance,&lt;ref name=Raimundas /&gt; something that was declared by the Vilnius Conference, but omitted in the Act of 11 December.&lt;ref name=MG&gt;{{cite journal |title=Jonas Vileišis ir Vasario 16-osios Aktas |url=http://ausis.gf.vu.lt/mg/nr/2001/12/12v.html |first=Dobilas |last=Kirvelis |journal=Mokslas ir gyvenimas |year=2001 |volume=12 |issue=528 |issn=0134-3084 |language=lt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927183000/http://ausis.gf.vu.lt/mg/nr/2001/12/12v.html |archivedate=2006-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second part, mentioning the "firm and permanent alliance with Germany", was completely omitted.&lt;ref name=Skirius /&gt; Its final version was approved on 8 January 1918, the day that [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] announced his [[Fourteen Points]]. In its essence, the Act of 8 January did not differ from the Act of 16 February.&lt;ref name=MG /&gt;

However, [[Ober Ost]], the German military administration, rejected the changes. On 26 January, in compliance with the earlier request, the two versions of the notification were approved, but they did not include the changes of 8 January.&lt;ref name=Skirius /&gt; The texts were prepared based on the Act of 11 December. These concessions to the Germans created tensions among the council members.&lt;ref name=gerutis /&gt; Four members – [[Mykolas Biržiška]], [[Steponas Kairys]], [[Stanisław Narutowicz]] and [[Jonas Vileišis]] – resigned from the Council in protest.&lt;ref name=eidintas /&gt; Chairman [[Antanas Smetona]], who supported the Act of 11 December, stepped down.&lt;ref name=MG /&gt; Jonas Basanavičius, who would later be called the patriarch of independence, was elected chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nezabitauskas |first=Adolfas |title=Jonas Basanavičius| year=1990| page=6| publisher=Vaga |location=Vilnius| isbn=5-415-00640-0|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act of 16 February===
Germany failed to recognize Lithuania as an independent state, and the Lithuanian delegation was not invited to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk negotiations]] that started on 22 December 1917, between the [[Central Powers]] and [[Russian SFSR|Russia]] in order to settle territorial claims.&lt;ref name=gerutis /&gt; During the first and final official joint session between the Council and the German authorities, it was made clear that the Council would serve only as an advisory board.&lt;ref name=Skirius /&gt; This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who were seeking independence without any ties to other countries. The prime concern at this point was to invite back those members who had left the Council. Negotiations were undertaken that led to the reformulation of previous versions of the Act.&lt;ref name=eidintas /&gt;

The four withdrawn members demanded that the Council return to the Act of 8 January and omit the mention of any alliance with Germany.&lt;ref name=Raimundas /&gt; After heated debates that lasted for several weeks, on 15 February, at 10 am, the new revision of the Act was ready. It included, with minor stylistic changes, wording of the Act of 8 January and [[promulgation]] and notification, drafted on 1 February. Promulgation and notification do not carry legal weight and do not change the meaning of a legal document.&lt;ref name=Raimundas /&gt; The Council, including the withdrawn members, was invited to return the next day for its finalization. On the next day, 16 February 1918, at 12:30 pm, all twenty Council members met in the room of Lithuanian Committee for Support of the War Victims, at 30 [[Didžioji Street]] in Vilnius.&lt;ref name=Skirius /&gt; The building has since been known as the [[House of the Signatories]] ({{lang-lt|signatarų namai}}) and houses a museum. The Council first voted to approve the first part, the first two paragraphs up to the word ''drauge'', of the Act. This section was approved unanimously.&lt;ref name=maks&gt;{{cite book| first=Mindaugas |last=Maksimaitis |title=Lietuvos valstybės konstitucijų istorija (XX a. pirmoji pusė) |publisher=Justitia |location=Vilnius |year=2005 |isbn=9955-616-09-1 |pages=36–44|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second part, however, did not receive support from the four withdrawn members because they were not satisfied with the word "''finally''" in describing the duties of the Constituent Assembly (in "''... the foundation of the Lithuanian State and its relations with other countries will be finally determined by the Constituent Assembly ...''").&lt;ref name=maks /&gt; They were afraid that this word would give a pretext for the Council to usurp the powers of the Constituent Assembly, while the majority argued that the word simply expressed the non-negotiable and non-appealable nature of the future Assembly's decisions.&lt;ref name=Raimundas /&gt; Therefore, the Act was unanimously approved ''[[:wiktionary:en bloc|en bloc]]'' but did not have full-fledged support from all twenty men.&lt;ref name=maks /&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Lithuania===
[[File:Lietuvos aidas independence.jpg|thumb|220px|The front page of ''Lietuvos aidas'' with the text of the Act. The bulk of the issue was confiscated by German authorities.]]
Soon after the signing, the Act was taken to Germany and handed to parties in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]. On 18 February, the text was reprinted in German newspapers, including ''[[Das Neue Litauen]]'', ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'', ''[[Taegliche Rundschau]]'' and ''[[Kreuzzeitung]]''.&lt;ref name=el /&gt; In Lithuania a text of the proclamation was prepared for printing in newspapers, particularly in ''[[Lietuvos aidas]]'', the Council's newspaper established by Antanas Smetona; but the German authorities prohibited this publication. Although the majority of the copies of the issue were confiscated, the newspaper's editor, [[Petras Klimas]], managed to hide about 60 of them.&lt;ref name=Skirius /&gt;

On 3 March 1918, Germany and the now-[[Bolshevik]] [[Russian SFSR|Russia]] signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. It declared that the [[Baltic states|Baltic nations]] were in the German interest zone and that Russia renounced any claims to them. On 23 March, Germany recognized independent Lithuania on the basis of the 11 December declaration.&lt;ref name=el /&gt; However, in substance, nothing had changed either in Lithuania or in the Council's status: any efforts to establish an administration were hindered.&lt;ref name=gerutis&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerutis |first=Albertas |editor= Albertas Gerutis |others= translated by Algirdas Budreckis|title= Lithuania: 700 Years |year=1984 |edition=6th |publisher= Manyland Books|location= New York|isbn=0-87141-028-1 |pages=151–162 |chapter=Independent Lithuania}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation changed when the [[German Revolution]] started and Germany lost the war in the fall of 1918 – it was no longer in a position to dictate terms. The Council of Lithuania adopted the first provisional constitution on 2 November. The functions of government were entrusted to a three-member presidium, and [[Augustinas Voldemaras]] was invited to form the first Cabinet of Ministers of Lithuania.&lt;ref name=eidintas&gt;{{cite book |last=Eidintas |first=Alfonsas |author2=Vytautas Žalys |author3=[[Alfred Erich Senn]] |editor=Edvardas Tuskenis |title=Lithuania in European Politics: The Years of the First Republic, 1918–1940 |edition=Paperback |date=September 1999 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-312-22458-3 |pages=24–31 |chapter=Chapter 1: Restoration of the State }}&lt;/ref&gt; Complete international recognition took several years; the US affirmed it on 22 July 1922.&lt;ref name="Lauterpacht2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hersch Lauterpacht|title=Recognition in International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWgEv1Qq2TwC&amp;pg=PA11|date=1 November 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-60943-3|page=11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502154217/https://books.google.com/books?id=EWgEv1Qq2TwC&amp;pg=PA11|archivedate=2 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Act===
Two copies of the Act were signed: the original and a duplicate. The original was given to Jonas Basanavičius to safeguard and protect. The original was never published or used in any public matters; its existence was first mentioned in the press in 1933.&lt;ref name=orig&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnm.lt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=64&amp;Itemid=100 |title=1918 m. vasario 16 d.

Both the original and the duplicate were missing for decades; historians and adventurers hunted for them. In 2006, a team of engineers searched the walls of the [[Vileišis Palace|former house]] of [[Petras Vileišis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006-02-13 |title=Viltis rasti Vasario 16-osios akto originalą vis labiau blėsta |url=http://www.lrytas.lt/?id=11398300311138538447&amp;view=4 |publisher=[[Lietuvos rytas]] |accessdate=2007-02-06 |language=lt |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102545/http://www.lrytas.lt/?id=11398300311138538447&amp;view=4 |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[facsimile]]s of the duplicate were produced, one in 1928 and the other in 1933. The 1928 facsimile is a closer reproduction of the Act in its original state. It contains spelling errors and the background is visually "noisy", while the 1933 facsimile shows the Act in an "improved" condition.&lt;ref name=orig /&gt;

In 2017, Lithuanian businessman [[Darius Mockus]] offered a 1-million-[[Euro]] reward to anyone who could find the original document and give it to the State of Lithuania. The offer's deadline was set to 16 February 2018, when Lithuania will commemorate the 100th anniversary of its declaration of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules – Act of Independence of Lithuania|url=http://vasario16aktas.lt/iniciatyvos-pradzia/en/|website=vasario16aktas.lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 March 2017, [[Vytautas Magnus University]] professor [[Liudas Mažylis]] announced he had found the original document in the [[Federal Foreign Office|Federal Foreign Office Political Archive]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], hand-written in the [[Lithuanian language]] and signed by the twenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlyne rastas Vasario 16-osios akto originalas – LRT|url=http://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/lietuvoje/2/168155|website=Lietuvos Radijas ir Televizija|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=lt|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329230720/http://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/lietuvoje/2/168155|archivedate=29 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also announced that he had found the German-language version of the 16 February 1918 document and the Act of 11 December 1917.

===The signatories===
{{Main|Signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania}}
Most of the signatories of the Act remained active in the cultural and political life of independent Lithuania. [[Jonas Vileišis]] served in the [[Seimas]] and as [[mayor]] of [[Kaunas]], [[temporary capital of Lithuania]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor = Simas Sužiedėlis | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title = Vileišis, Jonas | year = 1970–1978 | publisher = Juozas Kapočius | volume = VI | location = Boston, Massachusetts | id = {{LCC|74-114275}} | pages = 124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saliamonas Banaitis]] was involved in finance, opening several banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor = Simas Sužiedėlis | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title = Banaitis, Saliamonas | year = 1970–1978 | publisher = Juozas Kapočius | volume = I | location = Boston, Massachusetts | id = {{LCC|74-114275}} | pages = 282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the signatories were two future Presidents of Lithuania, [[Antanas Smetona]] and [[Aleksandras Stulginskis]]. [[Jonas Basanavičius]], chairman of the Council of Lithuania, returned to an academic life, pursuing his research in Lithuanian culture and folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor = Simas Sužiedėlis | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title = Basanavičius, Jonas | year = 1970–1978 | publisher = Juozas Kapočius | volume = I | location = Boston, Massachusetts | id = {{LCC|74-114275}} | pages =307–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five signatories died before [[World War II]] started; three died during the [[Nazi occupation of Lithuania|Nazi occupation]]. Those who did not emigrate to Western countries became [[political prisoner]]s after Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.vilnensis.vu.lt/nr-17/signatar.html |title=Vasario 16-osios Akto signatarai |first=Sigitas |last=Jegelavičius |journal=Universitas Vilnensis |publisher=[[Vilnius University]] |date=February 2002 |issue=17  |issn=1822-1513 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128041835/http://www.vilnensis.vu.lt/nr-17/signatar.html |archivedate=2007-01-28 |language=Lithuanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2651">'''Adjusted Peak Performance''' (APP) is a metric introduced by the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]]'s [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] (BIS) to more accurately predict the suitability of a computing system to complex computational problems, specifically those used in simulating [[nuclear weapons]]. This is used to determine the export limitations placed on certain computer systems under the [[Export Administration Regulations]] 15 CFR.

The (simplified) algorithm used to calculate APP consists of the following steps:

* Determine how many 64 bit (or better) floating point operations every processor in the system can perform per clock cycle (best case). This is FPO(i).
* Determine the clock frequency of every processor. This is F(i).
* Choose the weighting factor for each processor: 0.9 for vector processors and 0.3 for non-vector processors. This is W(i).
* Calculate the APP for the system as follows: APP = FPO(1) * F(1) * W(1) + ... + FPO(n) * F(n) * W(n). 

The metric was introduced in April 2006 to replace the Composite Theoretical Performance (CTP) metric which was introduced in 1993. APP was itself replaced in November 2007 when the BIS amended 15 CFR to include the December 2006 [[Wassenaar Arrangement]] Plenary Agreement Implementation's new metric - [[FLOPS|Gigaflops]] (GFLOPS), one billion floating point operations per second,  or TeraFLOPS, one trillion floating point operations per second.

The unit of measurement is Weighted TeraFLOPS (WT) to specify Adjusted Peak Performance (APP). 

The weighting factor is 0.3 for non-vector processors and 0.9 for vector processors. For example, a PowerPC 750 running at 800MHz would be rated at 0.00024 WT due to being able to execute one floating point instruction per cycle and not having a vector unit. Note that only 64 bit (or wider) floating point instructions count.

Notes:

* Processors without 64 bit (or better) floating point support have an FPO of zero.
* The current APP limit is 0.75 WT.
* Use the document referenced below (or an updated version) if you need to calculate APP for export purposes. It holds more details and a number of clarifications and exceptions. Also consult a lawyer who specializes in these things.

The '''Alte Nationalgalerie''' (Old National Gallery) in [[Berlin]] is an [[art gallery]] showing a collection of [[Neoclassicism#Painting and printmaking|Neoclassical]], [[Romanticism#Romantic visual arts|Romantic]], [[Biedermeier#Visual arts|Biedermeier]], [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] and early [[Modernism|Modernist]] artwork, part of the [[National Gallery (Berlin)|Berlin National Gallery]], which in turn is part of the [[Staatliche Museen zu Berlin]]. It is the original building of the National Gallery, whose holdings are now housed in several additional buildings. It is situated on [[Museum Island]], a [[UNESCO]]-designated [[World Heritage site]].

== History ==

=== Founding ===
The first impetus to founding a national gallery came in 1815. The idea gained momentum during the 1830s, but without an actual building. In 1841 the first real plans were created. These plans never made it out of the planning stages, but finally in 1861 the [[National Gallery (Berlin)|National Gallery]] was founded, after banker [[Johann Heinrich Wagener]] donated 262 paintings by both German and foreign artists. This donation formed the basis of the current collection. The collection was first known as ''Wagenersche und Nationalgalerie'' (Wagener and National Gallery) and was housed in the buildings of the [[Akademie der Künste]]. The current building, shaped like a Roman [[temple]] with an appended [[apse]], was designed by [[Friedrich August Stüler]] and after his death, realised in detail under [[Carl Busse (architect)|Carl Busse]].

=== Building and related developments ===
[[Image:BerlinNationalgalerie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Picture of the Alte Nationalgalerie from [[Heinrich August Pierer]]'s ''Universal-Lexikon'', 1891.]]
[[Friedrich August Stüler]] began working on a design for the building in 1863, based on a sketch by King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]].&lt;ref name=Keisch7&gt;Claude Keisch, ''The Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin'', London: Scala / Munich: Beck, 2005, {{ISBN|9783406526756}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ApOj7UXAPkYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nationalgalerie+Berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MlPLT_yKN4To2QX8oZnaCw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=based%20on%20a%20sketch%20by%20the%20king&amp;f=false p. 7].&lt;/ref&gt; Two years and two failed plans later, his third proposal was finally accepted. Stüler died before planning was completed and [[Carl Busse (architect)|Carl Busse]] handled the remaining details in 1865. In 1866, by order of the king and his [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], the ''Kommission für den Bau der Nationalgalerie'' (Commission for the construction of the national gallery) was created. Ground was broken in 1867 under the supervision of [[Heinrich Strack]]. In 1872 the structure was completed and interior work began. The opening took place on March 22, 1876 in the presence of the Kaiser.

Because of the building's modern construction using brick and iron, it was widely believed to be fireproof. The exterior and outer staircase were constructed of [[Triassic]] sandstone from [[Nebra (Unstrut)|Nebra]]. At the opening the collection was still relatively small. Next to Wagener's collection, originally, was a display of [[Cartoon#Fine art|cartoon]]s by [[Peter von Cornelius]] that had been bequeathed to the Prussian government. The initial objective of the gallery was to collect contemporary, primarily Prussian art, as Berlin did not then have any repository of modern art.

In 1874 Max Jordan became the first director of the National Gallery. In 1896 he was succeeded by [[Hugo von Tschudi]], who acquired [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] works, risking conflict with the Kaiser because this ended the collection's focus on German art. The German National Gallery thus became the most important museum for modern French Art at the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Demandt: „Schule des Sehens“. Die Nationalgalerie und die Moderne, in: Angelika Wesenberg (Hg.), Impressionismus – Expressionismus. Kunstwende, Berlin 2015, pp 13-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
In 1909, [[Ludwig Justi]] assumed the post of director, and added [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] works to the collection. Following the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]] that ended Imperial rule, he moved the modern art to the [[Kronprinzenpalais]] at the end of [[Unter den Linden]], which became known as ''National Gallery II''.

In 1933, the new [[Nazi Germany|Nazi authorities]] dismissed Justi, who was followed by [[Eberhard Hanfstaengl]]. He remained until 1937, when he too was dismissed. His successor, [[Paul Ortwin Rave]], remained until 1950, although because of World War II the building was closed during much of that time. It was heavily damaged in Allied air raids. It was partly reopened in 1949, but reconstruction continued until 1969. Between 1998 and 2001, the museum was renovated thoroughly by German architect [[HG Merz]]. Some extra halls were added on the uppermost floor and now contain the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] works. The three-year, $62 million renovation of the Alte Nationalgalerie was part of a refurbishment of [[Museum Island]] and the energetic effort by government and private institutions to re-establish Berlin as Germany's political and cultural heart.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Butler (December 2, 2001), [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/world/berlin-museum-s-revival-bolsters-german-identity.html Berlin Museum's Revival Bolsters German Identity] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The Alte Nationalgalerie, together with the [[Altes Museum]], the [[Neues Museum]], the [[Bode Museum]], the [[Pergamon Museum]], the [[Berlin Cathedral]] and the [[Lustgarten]], make up the [[Museum Island]] complex in Berlin. It is situated in the middle of the island, between the rails of the [[Berlin Stadtbahn]] and Bode Street on the eastern banks.

It is connected to the Pergamon Museum to the north, and to the Neues Museum, the Altes Museum, and the Berlin Cathedral to the south. The building was designed by [[Friedrich August Stüler]] with details by [[Carl Busse (architect)|Carl Busse]], in an architectural style that is a mix between late Classicism and early [[Neo-Renaissance]], and realised by [[Heinrich Strack]]. It was intended to express "the unity of art, nation, and history", and therefore has aspects reminiscent of a church (an apse) and a theatre (the grand staircase) as well as a temple. An equestrian statue of Frederick William IV tops the stairs, and the inside stairs have a frieze by [[Otto Geyer]] depicting German history from prehistoric times to the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Keisch7/&gt; The exterior of the building still retains its original appearance, whereas the interior has been renovated many times in order to suit the exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;Keisch, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ApOj7UXAPkYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nationalgalerie+Berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MlPLT_yKN4To2QX8oZnaCw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=seen%20as%20sacrifices%20to%20function&amp;f=false p. 8].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==

The collection contains works of the [[Neoclassicism#Painting and printmaking|Neoclassical]] and [[Romanticism#Romantic visual arts|Romantic]] movements (by artists such as [[Caspar David Friedrich]], [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]], and [[Karl Blechen]]), of the [[Biedermeier#Visual arts|Biedermeier]], French [[Impressionism]] (such as [[Édouard Manet]] and [[Claude Monet]]) and early [[Modernism]] (including [[Adolph von Menzel]], [[Max Liebermann]] and [[Lovis Corinth]]). Among the most important exhibits are Friedrich's ''[[The Monk by the Sea|Der Mönch am Meer]]'' (The Monk by the Sea), von Menzel's ''Eisenwalzwerk'' (The Iron Rolling Mill) and sculptor [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]]'s ''Prinzessinnengruppe'', a double statue of princesses [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] and [[Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Frederica of Prussia]]. The Alte Nationalgalerie houses one of the largest collections of 19th-century sculptures and paintings in Germany.&lt;ref name="AN: About" /&gt;

'''Atlant''' was the first [[atlas]] of the world in the [[Slovene language]]. It was published three centuries after the publication of the first Slovene book (1550), [[Catechismus]], by [[Primož Trubar]], and the publication of the first atlas ever, [[Theatre of the World]] (1570), by [[Abraham Ortelius]]. It was a means of placing [[Slovenes]] and the Slovene language on a world map. It consisted of six sets of three sheets, published in 1869, 1871, 1872, 1874, 1875, and 1877, altogether 18 maps. The geographical names were prepared by the lawyer [[Matej Cigale]] (1819-1889). A number of foreign names were translated into the Slovene language or Slovenised for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://giam.zrc-sazu.si/zbornik/ags46-2-4-UrbancFridlKladnikPerko_str-251-283.pdf |chapter=Atlant: the first atlas of the world in the Slovene language |title=Atlant and Slovene National Consciousness in the Second Half of the 19th Century |author=Urbanc, Mimi |author2=Fridl, Jerneja |author3=Kladnik, Drago |author4=Perko, Drago |journal=Acta Geographica Slovenica |volume=46 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=251–283 |doi=10.3986/AGS46204 |access-date=2012-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223190605/http://giam.zrc-sazu.si/zbornik/ags46-2-4-UrbancFridlKladnikPerko_str-251-283.pdf |archive-date=2012-02-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Augustenburger Briefen''' (''Augustenburg Letters'') are a collection of letters on aesthetics written by [[Friedrich Schiller]] in 1793 to [[Frederick Christian II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg|Friedrich Christian von Augustenburg]]. They represent an early draft of what would be published in 1795 as ''Über die ästhetische Erziehung des Menschen in einer Reihe von Briefen'' ("Letters on the aesthetic education of man"), but were believed lost in a fire. They were only published, on the basis of surviving copies, in 1875.

The film stars [[John Cusack]], [[Cameron Diaz]], and [[Catherine Keener]], with [[John Malkovich]] and [[Charlie Sheen]] as themselves. The film follows a puppeteer who finds a portal that leads into Malkovich's mind.

Released by [[USA Films]], the film was nominated in three categories at the [[72nd Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Jonze, [[Best Original Screenplay]] for Kaufman and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Keener.

== Plot ==
Craig Schwartz is an unemployed puppeteer in a forlorn marriage with his pet-obsessed wife Lotte. Gaining a file clerk job through Dr. Lester at LesterCorp, in the strange Floor {{frac|7|1|2}} low-ceiling offices of the Mertin-Flemmer Building in New York City, he develops an attraction to his coworker Maxine Lund, who does not return his affections. Craig discovers and enters a small door hidden behind a filing cabinet, and crawls down a tunnel. Suddenly he is quickly drawn into the opposite end of the tunnel,  and finds himself in the mind of actor [[John Malkovich]].

Craig is able to observe and sense whatever Malkovich does for fifteen minutes before he is ejected and dropped into a ditch near the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]. He reveals the portal to Maxine, who sees the profit in it, and they let others use it for $200 a turn.

Craig tells Lotte, who becomes obsessed with the experience, which had allowed her to live out her [[transgender]] desires. Lotte becomes attracted to Maxine when she is experiencing Malkovich, and she and Malkovich begin a sexual relationship with Lotte inside Malkovich's head while Maxine and Malkovich have sex. Craig, forsaken by both women, binds and gags Lotte and locks her in a cage with the chimpanzee, then enters Malkovich's mind and has sex with Maxine.

Soon Craig, with his expert puppeteer skills, discovers that he is able to control Malkovich's actions while in his head. This causes the actor to feel paranoid that he is being controlled by someone else. After Malkovich consults with his friend [[Charlie Sheen]], Malkovich trails Maxine to the Mertin-Flemmer building, where he himself tries the portal into his own head. He finds himself in a world where everyone has his face and they only say "Malkovich", and views his own lifetime history. He is then ejected and meets Craig by the turnpike. Malkovich demands that the portal be closed, but Craig refuses.

Lotte escapes with the help of her pet chimpanzee, who learned how to untie knots in Africa during a zoological capture, which is shown viewed from the chimpanzee's point of view. Lotte phones Maxine, revealing that it was Craig having sex with her while inside Malkovich. Maxine is annoyed but accepts it, because she enjoyed the experience.

Seeking help, Lotte finds Lester, who reveals himself to be Captain Mertin, the original founder of LesterCorp. Lester is aware of the portal, and has a room dedicated to Malkovich's life. Lester explains that the person who is connected to the portal becomes "ripe" for lasting occupation by others on the eve of their 44th birthday. However, when the host turns 44, the portal immediately moves to its next host, an unborn child.

If it is possible for a person to take advantage of the "ripe" host and enter the portal then, one can greatly increase one's lifespan, and then  one can eventually move on to another host. However, if one misses the brief window of "ripeness", and enters the portal even a minute too late, one will find oneself trapped within the unborn child who will be the next host. Lester, who has been using the portal in order to prolong his life, reveals his plan to use Malkovich when "ripe" as the host for him and several of his elderly friends. Offered the chance to join Lester's group, Lotte warns him that Craig currently has control of Malkovich.

Craig finds he is able to remain in Malkovich indefinitely. He spends the next eight months in Malkovich's body, and using his puppeteer's control, he is able to turn Malkovich into a world-class puppeteer. Malkovich marries Maxine. He learns that she is pregnant as their relationship grows distant.

As Malkovich's 44th birthday approaches, Lester and his friends cut a deal with Maxine, and fake her kidnapping. They call up Craig, threatening to kill her if Craig does not leave Malkovich. Craig ends the call, causing Lester to think that he is calling their bluff. Lotte loses hope and attempts to kill Maxine, but they end up at the turnpike after falling through the portal and through Malkovich's shame-ridden subconscious. Maxine reveals to Lotte that Maxine conceived when Lotte was inside Malkovich's body, and she kept the child because it is "theirs". The revelation cements their love for each other.

Craig calls Lester back, thinking Maxine is still in danger. Realizing his opportunity, Lester continues his bluff, convincing Craig to leave Malkovich's body. Lester and his friends enter the portal, taking control of Malkovich. Craig, discovering that Lotte and Maxine are together again, decides to enter the portal to become Malkovich and regain Maxine, however he has unknowingly missed the deadline for getting into Malkovich. Years later, an aging Malkovich, containing the collective mind of Lester and his friends, reveals to Sheen a plan to prolong their lives via Maxine's daughter Emily, within whom Craig is now permanently trapped. Through Emily's eyes Craig is forced to watch Maxine and Lotte living happily together as he futilely pleads that Emily look away.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Kaufman's idea of ''Being John Malkovich'' originated simply as "a story about a man who falls in love with someone who is not his wife." Gradually he added further elements to the story which he found entertaining, such as floor 7½ of the Mertin Flemmer building; among his first ideas, Malkovich was "nowhere to be seen".&lt;ref name="Salon" /&gt; He wrote the script [[Spec script|on spec]] in 1994 and though it was widely read by [[production company]] and [[film studio]] executives, all turned it down.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; Hoping to find a producer, Kaufman sent the script to Francis Ford Coppola, who passed it on to his then-son-in-law Spike Jonze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Being John Malkovich'' a quirky wonder |work=[[Arizona Daily Star]] |url=http://azstarnet.com/entertainment/movies/article_ee681184-48ef-558a-956f-8f431ab4dc0c.html |first=Phil |last=Villarreal |date=January 7, 2007 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonze first read the script in 1996 and had agreed to direct the film by 1997.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; Jonze brought the script to [[Propaganda Films]], which agreed to produce the film in partnership with production company Single Cell Pictures.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; Single Cell producers [[Michael Stipe]] and [[Sandy Stern]] pitched the film to numerous studios, including [[New Line Cinema]], who dropped the project after chairman [[Robert Shaye]] asked: "Why the fuck can't it be ''Being [[Tom Cruise]]''?".&lt;ref name="Advocate" /&gt; Jonze revealed in a September 2013 interview that Malkovich asked him the same question during their first meeting and also relayed Malkovich's attitude after filming commenced:

{{quote|Either the movie's a bomb and it's got not only my name above the title but my name in the title, so I'm fucked that way; or it does well and I'm just forever associated with this character.&lt;ref name="Chris"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spike Jonze on letting ''Her'' rip and ''Being John Malkovich'' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/sep/09/spike-jonze-her-scarlett-johansson |accessdate=September 13, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=September 9, 2013 |first=Chris |last=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jonze explained in the same interview that he didn't realize how brave Malkovich's performance in the film was.&lt;ref name="Chris" /&gt;

The puppets in the film were created by Kamela Portuges and Images in Motion.

===Casting===
Diaz's [[make-up artist]] Gucci Westman described styling Diaz in the role as "a challenge, to make her look homely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=5 Minutes with Gucci Westman |work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue Australia]] |url=http://www.vogue.com.au/beauty/five+minutes+with/5+minutes+with+gucci+westman,2819 |first=Sigourney |last=Cantelo |date=March 11, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script included minimal physical descriptions of characters, and thus when Diaz took up the role she did not know that "people weren't going to recognize me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cameron Diaz and Catherine Keener |work=CrankyCritic.com |url=http://www.crankycritic.com/qa/diaz_keener.html |first=Paul |last=Fischer |accessdate=November 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107062624/http://www.crankycritic.com/qa/diaz_keener.html |archivedate=January 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cusack read the film's script after he had asked his [[Talent agent|agent]] to present him with the "craziest, most unproduceable script you can find." Impressed with the script, he asked his agent to follow its progress and book him an audition, with which he won the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Cusack |work=[[The A.V.

Keener cited ''Being John Malkovich'' as an instance of her taking up a role based on the director's previous work. She had heard about Jonze's experience with [[music video]]s and took up the part of Maxine although she initially disliked the character and did not feel that she was right for the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Being Catherine Keener |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/style/tmagazine/t_w_1595_1597_well_keener_.html |first=Lynn |last=Hirschberg |date=August 27, 2006 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlie Kaufman]] said that there was never another actor in Malkovich's place in the script: "The screenplay was always "Being John Malkovich", even before I had any expectation that John Malkovich would even read the script."&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite web |title=Charlie Kaufman |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117792734 |first=Robert |last=Holfer |date=September 14, 1999 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose Malkovich because he believed there to be "an enigmatic quality about him that works",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mike Leigh interview, and ''Being John Malkovich'' premiere |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/nov/10/mikeleigh |date=November 10, 1999 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Malkovich was partly chosen because of the sound of his name in repetition. Kaufman explained that "When we were thinking of alternatives, we found that a lot of them weren't fun to say."&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web |title=Being Charlie Kaufman |work=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/11/11/kaufman/print.html |first=Michael |last=Sragow |date=November 11, 1999 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonze's then-father-in-law [[Francis Ford Coppola]] was able to contact Malkovich,&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=FILM; The Fun and Games of Living a Virtual Life |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/24/arts/film-the-fun-and-games-of-living-a-virtual-life.html |first=Peter |last=Kobel |date=October 24, 1999 |accessdate=November 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128172027/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/24/arts/film-the-fun-and-games-of-living-a-virtual-life.html |archivedate=November 28, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jonze flew with producer [[Sandy Stern]] to Malkovich's home in France.

Spike Jonze makes a [[cameo appearance]] as Derek Mantini's assistant; Mantini is billed in the story as the greatest puppeteer in the history of the world and arouses Schwartz's envy. [[Brad Pitt]] also has a half-second-long [[Cameo appearance|cameo]], as a miffed star in the documentary on Malkovich's career, who seems to be on the verge of saying something before the shot ends. [[Sean Penn]] appears as a fictionalized version of himself and a fan of Malkovich's puppeteer work. Film director [[David Fincher]] makes an uncredited appearance as Christopher Bing in the American Arts &amp; Culture [[pseudo-documentary]] on John Malkovich. [[Winona Ryder]], [[Andy Dick]], and the members of [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] can be seen in the audience of a Malkovich puppet show.&lt;ref name="IMDb"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120601/fullcredits#cast |title=''Being John Malkovich'' (1999) – Full Cast &amp; Crew |work=[[IMDb]] |publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review, [[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film a full four stars; he would later name it the best film of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Best 10 Movies of 1999 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19991231/COMMENTARY/40308007/1023 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=[[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]] |date=December 31, 1999 |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His comments of praise included: "Rare is the movie where the last half hour surprises you just as much as the first, and in ways you're not expecting. The movie has ideas enough for half a dozen films, but Jonze and his cast handle them so surely that we never feel hard-pressed; we're enchanted by one development after the next" and he also felt that "Either ''Being John Malkovich'' gets nominated for best picture, or the members of the Academy need portals into their brains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/being-john-malkovich-1999|title=''Being John Malkovich'' Review|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|date=October 29, 1999|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]]|accessdate=August 27, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another top critic [[Peter Rainer]], writing for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', commented that "dazzlingly singular movies aren't often this much fun" in his review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rainer |first=Peter |title=Get Outta My Face |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/reviews/1362 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |date=November 8, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Owen Gleiberman]], writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', called it "the most excitingly original movie of the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |title=''Being John Malkovich'' Review |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,271590,00.html |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=December 17, 2010 |date=November 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to ''Get Out''==
{{main|Get Out}}
Following the financial and critical success of the 2017 film ''Get Out'', varying fan theories arose delving into the social horror themes of the film. In December of that year, the film's writer/director/producer [[Jordan Peele]] had an interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in which he discussed the major fan theories surrounding the film, confirming which of the most popular were true and false. Peele stated that he and ''Being John Malkovich'' director [[Spike Jonze]] had discussed the theory that ''Get Out'' was a secret [[stand-alone sequel]] to ''Being John Malkovich'', and, although admitting that ''Get Out'' was never conceived as a sequel to ''Being John Malkovich'' or thought of as such until after the film was released, Peele stated that since hearing the theory both himself and Jonze viewed the connection as both films being set in the same continuity, saying that "as far as I'm concerned, it's true".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBvcngHRTFg | title = Jordan Peele Breaks Down "Get Out" Fan Theories from Reddit | publisher = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date = December 1, 2017 | accessdate = December 4, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory states that [[Catherine Keener]]'s "Maxine" in ''Being John Malkovich'' is the same character as "Missy" in ''Get Out''; ''Being John Malkovich'' concludes with Maxine and Lotte raising a child fathered by John Malkovich, but unbeknownst to them, the spirit of Craig is trapped inside the child's mind. With the portal to Malkovich's mind officially closed, they sought out other avenues for mind-transplant experimentation, eventually coming across Roman Armitage ([[Richard Herd]]), a neurosurgeon. Lotte entered the body of Dean Armitage ([[Bradley Whitford]]), Roman's son, and Emily, combined with the spirit of Craig, living in his own "Sunken Place", grows up to become the malevolent sociopath that is Rose Armitage ([[Allison Williams (actress)|Allison Williams]]), all completely complicit in the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1733729/jordan-peele-confirms-hilarious-get-out-theory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/get-out-jordan-peele-fan-theory-being-john-malkovich/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://io9.gizmodo.com/watch-jordan-peele-respond-to-some-great-get-out-fan-th-1820946824&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his video about the theory in the January 2018 issue of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', Peele expressed interest in casting John Malkovich in a ''Get Out'' sequel, stating that it would be "cool" to "do the full trilogy".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' January 2018 Edition

'''''Beyond the Deepening Shadow: The Tower Remembers''''' was an artistic [[Installation art|installation]] at the [[Tower of London]] in November 2018, to commemorate the [[First World War centenary|centenary]] of the end of the [[First World War]].

Each evening in the week before [[Remembrance Day]], 10,000 torches were lit in the [[moat]] of the tower, after an opening ceremony of a [[bugle call]], [[minute of silence]] and [[reveille]].&lt;ref name=DT/&gt;  The torches remained lit for several hours while loudspeakers broadcast a [[soundscape]] composed by [[Mira Calix]], based on a [[sonnet]] written by nurse [[Mary Borden]] to a [[Edward Spears|British officer]] at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]].&lt;ref name=G/&gt;  The event was conceived by [[Tom Piper]] and directed by [[Anna Morrissey]].&lt;ref name=DT/&gt;

The installation was similar to ''[[Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red]]'', an installation of [[Remembrance poppy|poppies]] at the Tower which commemorated the start of the war.  That was so popular that [[crowd control]] measures were organised to control the large number of spectators.&lt;ref name=DT/&gt;

'''Don Bombard''' (born December 16, 1948), known professionally as '''Bob Shannon''', is an American [[Radio personality|radio disc jockey]] best known for his work on [[WCBS-FM]] in [[New York City]].  He is also the author of the book ''Behind The Hits: Inside Stories of Classic Pop and Rock and Roll''.

He has a son, Scott (no relation to current WCBS-FM morning DJ [[Scott Shannon]]), and a daughter, Avery.

==Early life==
Don Bombard was first introduced on radio by sportscaster [[Marv Albert]] as the winner of a guest deejay contest, while still a junior high school student in his hometown of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

At age 15, Bombard experimented with broadcasting from his home, using a radio that had the wiring reversed to become a transmitter. The radio's antenna was hooked to a radiator, utilizing the water pipes to get the signal out to his neighborhood. In high school he partnered with  Jody Carmen and Mel Cowznofski in the Big 50 "Hits of the Week Survey, which was printed and distributed in Syracuse, NY to local record stores.

He joined the staff of Syracuse University station  [[WAER|WAER-FM]] as a freshman in 1965.

Bombard came to the attention of the local Syracuse Top 40 stations [[WSKO (AM)|WNDR]] and [[WOLF (AM)|WOLF]] when, as a teenager, he compiled and distributed his own weekly music survey known as The Big 50.

Bombard then went on to work at both stations from 1967 to 1977, where he gained experience as an announcer, music director, and programmer.  He joined WNDR in 1967 as a part-time weekend dj. In 1968 he accepted an offer by WOLF to work full-time on their night show. He became the station's music director and atarted an all-request show. In 1969, he was part of the team that returned WOLF to a Top 40 format and remained as music director and night dj until the following year, when he was hired back full-time at WNDR.

There, he hosted a late-night "Attitude Hours" progressive rock show. Later he became assistant program director and afternoon drive DJ, as well as taking over the reins of the  "Saturday Night of Gold" oldies show.

In 1975, he left radio briefly to run "Don Bombard Disco", a company formed with partner Guy Capone. He returned to WOLF the following year and became program director.

While in Syracuse, Bombard collaborated with local music historian Ron Wray (aka Ron Gersbacher) on a documentary history of WOLF ("The WOLF Story") and a series of "History of Syracuse Music" albums. He also formed (with Wray) Piece Records.

==Move to Pittsburgh==
In 1977, Bombard moved to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to work at station  13Q (WKTQ). He began as production director and then moved to afternoon drive dj. He originated and hosted “The Sunday Night Oldies Party”. Bombard also released (with record collector Frank DeMino) a compilation album called "The Pittsburgh Hall of Fame". He also did booth announcing for [[WIIC]] (now [[WPXI]]) television.

==Arrival at WCBS-FM==
In late 1981 Bombard moved to New York City to work part-time at a recording studio owned by Wendell Craig, formerly dj Windy Craig at WOLF. While there, with Craig's blessings, he launched a radio syndication company called Sirius Productions. Bombard then began as a fill-in announcer at [[WQHT|WYNY]] (now [[WQHT]]). Shortly after, he would leave WYNY for [[WCBS-FM]] and  began doing some booth announcing for [[WWOR-TV|WOR-TV]]. He used his given name on WYNY, but at CBS-FM (which already had Don K. Reed) his on-air name was changed to Bobby Shannon by program director Joe McCoy. Gradually, his air name evolved to ''Bob Shannon''.

Shannon launched a weekend overnight spin-off of his Pittsburgh show on WCBS-FM called "The Oldies Party" and continued to tape a weekly Sunday night show for airing in Pittsburgh. He also briefly hosted the Saturday night show vacated by Jack Spector. In 1982, he was promoted to the full-time 6-10PM shift and originated (with music director Richard Lorenzo) a nightly "Hall of Fame" segment. This segment played "wall-to-wall" music from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. by a selected artist or a couple artists (if the artists each had only a few big hits). For bigger artists with many hits, the hall of fame feature sometimes began at 8 p.m. In 1986, with the exit of Dick Heatherton, he took over the afternoon drive time slot, where he remained until the station's two-year "sabbatical" that began in 2005. The Hall Of Fame was revamped in evenings to feature several to half a dozen songs an hour by a selected artists mixed in with other regularly played music. Bobby Jay took over except on Wednesdays. On Wednesday, [[Bruce Morrow|Cousin Bruce Morrow]] took over. At that point, on Thursdays the Hall Of Fame was strictly 60s music and on Fridays strictly 50s.

At WCBS-FM, on the 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. timeslot, he programmed music features such as "Rockeology", "Hands Across the Water", "First and Foremost", "lost hits", "songs with the same title but are different", "Wednesday Fourplay/Three For The Road", and others.  In 1986 he collected his interviews with music acts into a book, "Behind The Hits: Inside Stories of Classic Pop and Rock and Roll", co-authored with John Javna.

Shannon hosted a number of nationally syndicated radio shows, including "The Oldies Countdown" for MJI Broadcasting and "Keeping The '70s Alive" and "Behind The Hits" for On The Radio Broadcasting. He co-hosted, with WCBS-FM's Bobby Jay, live broadcasts for [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] from the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction ceremonies in New York.

In June 2005 WCBS-FM switched to an "[[Adult Hits]]" format called [[Jack FM]] which used no live DJs.  Shannon began a weekly show with his wife, Connie T. Empress, on [[WLNG]], Long Island, NY.  He also hosted a weekly Internet program, “Behind the Hits”, on [[Vip radio]] in Europe.  He also broadcast weekly internet radio shows at [http://radiomaxmusic.com RadioMaxMusic], and was instrumental in the creation of the Across The Tracks format used there.  He worked briefly at New Jersey's "The Breeze" [[WWZY]]/[[WBHX]] in 2007, and took part in the station's Radio Greats Weekend in July 2007 after his return to WCBS-FM.

==CBS-FM Returns==
When WCBS-FM came back to New York radio on July 12, 2007, Shannon helped launch the return. On November 18, as part of CBS-FM's weekly Radio Greats feature, he hosted a show as Don Bombard.

Shannon stopped performing his mid-day shift at WCBS-FM in late December 2011 or early 2012.{{Citation needed span |It was reported that he left the station for health reasons.|date=May 2017}}He was eventually replaced by Ron Parker.

==International trade==
Canada and the United States are member states of international trade organizations, including [[NAFTA]]—replaced by the [[United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement]] (USMCA) negotiated in 2018, [[G7]], [[G20]], [[OECD]] and [[WTO]].

According to a [[Global Affairs Canada]] 2018 report, Canada's exports increased 5.7% to a record high in 2017 of $CAD546.7&amp;nbsp;billion—$29.2&amp;nbsp;billion above the exports level in 2016.&lt;ref name="international_Vesselovsky_2018"&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.international.gc.ca/economist-economiste/assets/pdfs/performance/state_2018_point/SoT_PsC_2018-Eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=Canada’s State of Trade: Trade and Investment Update |date=2018|editor-first=Mykyta |editor-last=Vesselovsky |publisher=Global Affairs Canada |agency=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|number=FR2-8/2018 |access-date=November 6, 2018 |pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} In 2017 imports also rose to an all-time high of $CAD1,108&amp;nbsp;billion.

== Purchasing power parity ==
{{main|purchasing power parity}}

Based on a [[purchasing power parity]] scale, which compares the "relative purchasing power between two or more currencies",&lt;ref name="statcan_2017"/&gt;—income levels and costs are used to calculate the difference in the affordability of a similar basket of goods—in 2014, Canada was rated as 26% more expensive than the US.&lt;ref name="stats.oecd.org"/&gt; According to a [[Statistics Canada]] report released in 2017, the [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) for [[gross domestic income]] was US$0.84 per Canadian dollar. Comparable items cost one dollar in Canada compared to 84 cents in the United States. Since 1999, the PPP had been "relatively stable".&lt;ref name="statcan_2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/170424/dq170424c-eng.htm |title=Purchasing power parities, 2015

Although wealth is more highly concentrated in the US, the [[median]] (50th percentile) worker has about 23% more purchasing power as well.  In terms of [[purchasing power parity]], the most recent statistics from the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] has Canada (US$35,494) lower than that in the United States (US$43,444).&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 representative (i.e., Ontario) tax rate for a CCPC on its first CAD$500,000 of active business income is 13.5% (a 10.0% federal tax component and a 3.5% provincial tax component).

In the United States in 2017, [[mandatory spending]] totaled $2.5&amp;nbsp;trillion or 13.1% of GDP and included [[Social security]] $939&amp;nbsp;billion or 4.9% of GDP, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] 591&amp;nbsp;billion or 3.1% GDP, [[Medicaid]] $375&amp;nbsp;billion or 2.0% of GDP, and Other 614&amp;nbsp;billion or 3.2% GDP.&lt;ref name="CBO_2017_budget"/&gt; [[Discretionary spending]] totaled $1.2&amp;nbsp;trillion or 6.3% of GDP and included [[Military budget of the United States|Defense]] 590&amp;nbsp;billion or 3.1%GDP, and Nondefense 610&amp;nbsp;billion or 3.2% GDP.&lt;ref name="CBO_2017_budget"&gt;{{cite report |url= https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53624 |title=The Federal Budget in 2017: An Infographic |work=CBO }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest on debt totaled 263&amp;nbsp;billion representing 1.4% of GDP.&lt;ref name="CBO_2017_budget"/&gt;

====Health care====
{{main|Canadian and American health care systems compared}}

The United States spends more on health care than Canada. According to the OECD 2015 report comparing 35 OECD member countries, "spending per person on health care remained highest in the United States (CDN$11,916)". Canada spent CDN$5,782 per capita on health care in 2015.&lt;ref name="CIHI_2017"/&gt; In their 2017 report, the [[Canadian Institute for Health Information]] (CIHI) estimated that total health expenditure would reach "$242.0&amp;nbsp;billion or $6,604 per Canadian in 2017" representing 11.5% of Canada’s GDP.&lt;ref name="CIHI_2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cihi.ca/sites/default/files/document/nhex2017-trends-report-en.pdf  |format=PDF |title=National Health Expenditure Trends, 1975 to 2017 |publisher=Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) |isbn= 978-1-77109-649-2  |pages=45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} and total healthcare spending is much higher - 14.6% of GDP in the US vs. 10% in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/healthcare/priceofcare.html | work=CBC News | title=CBC News In-depth: Health Care}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Healthcare coverage is universal for Canadians, and transferable outside a home province within Canada. In the United States, however, the most common complaint is that approximately 50 million people are uninsured, and thus do not have access to even the most basic healthcare services which Canadians have access to. This puts a burden on the emergency room services in the States and causes increases in healthcare costs significantly.Canadians, however, receive better care to those Americans who receive treatment, and result measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/details/health.aspx|title=Health performance - health outcomes - Canada health ranking|website=www.conferenceboard.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Canada, health care is mostly paid through employee income taxes, while in the United States most companies choose to extend [[Health benefits (insurance)|health benefits]] to full-time employees. The most common complaint regarding the Canadian system are the long lines and waiting periods that have appeared for minor and non-life-threatening procedures over the last 15 years, since the introduction of widespread cuts to public funding. Separately, a number of medical tests and screenings are not covered (or due to increasing costs, are no longer covered) by the Canadian health system, forcing patients to pay for these services out of their own pockets. For these reasons, some relatively wealthy Canadians undergo treatment at private healthcare facilities at their own expense, either in Canada, in India, or in other nations&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/healthcare/medicaltourism.html | work=CBC News | title=CBC News In-depth: Health Care}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid waiting for medical treatment, joining "[[medical tourism|medical tourists]]" from many nations, including the US.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt; Despite these sporadic problems, Canada's healthcare performance has been of higher quality on most factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/UnitedStates/Health-at-a-Glance-2013-Press-Release-USA.pdf |title=Health at a glance |date=2013 |website=www.oecd.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/files/kf/field/field_pdf/Library-reading-list-international-health-care-comparisons-Jan2013.pdf |title=Helath care companies |date=2013 |website=www.kingsfund.org.uk |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were made to reduce wait times by many provincial governments in the 1990s and 2000s, in an effort to improve care.

==Fiscal and monetary policy==

===Inflation and the consumer price index===
In Canada in September 2018, the [[consumer price index]] (CPI) rose 2.2% on a year-over-year basis. The [[Bank of Canada]]'s monthly CPI measures changes in consumer prices based on the price of a "fixed basket of goods and services" purchased by Canadian consumers,&lt;ref name="statcan_BoC_2017"&gt;{{cite report |title=Bank of Canada's Preferred Measures of Core Inflation General Information Document |url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/statistical-programs/document/2301_D63_T9_V2 |date=November 28, 2017 |access-date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as made up of goods and services that Canadians typically buy, such as food, housing, transportation, furniture, clothing, recreation, and other items,&lt;ref name="BoC_2017"/&gt; with the target of maintaining the rate of inflation (the "year-over-year increase in the total CPI) at 2%—"midpoint of an inflation-control target range of 1 to 3%".&lt;ref name="BoC_2017"&gt;{{cite report |title=Bank of Canada's Preferred Measures of Core Inflation General Information Document |url=https://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/inflation/ |date=2017 |access-date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 24, 2018 the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate to 1.75%, the highest it has reached in ten years to prevent inflation. The key interest rate had been kept low in response to the 2008 economic slowdown.&lt;ref name="CBC_BoC_2018"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-canada-interest-rate-1.4875958 |title=Bank of Canada raises interest rate to 1.75% |date=October 24, 2018 |access-date=November 5, 2018 |newspaper=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; By raising the rate, the Bank of Canada is indicating that the Canadian economy no longer needs "stimulus."&lt;ref name="CBC_BoC_2018"/&gt;

In September 2018, The US [[Federal Reserve]] raised its key interest rate to 2.25%.&lt;ref name="CBC_FR_2018"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/federal-reserve-decision-1.4839442 |title=Federal Reserve raises U.S. benchmark interest rate to 2.25% — with more to come |date=September 26, 2018 |access-date=November 5, 2018 |newspaper=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workforce productivity==

Labor or [[workforce productivity]] measures the efficiency with which labor is used to produce goods and services. According to a 2017 Conference Board of Canada article, in 2015 "Canada's level of labour productivity was US$49 per hour worked, much lower than that of the United States, at US$63." Alberta's level was 99%. The lowest was in Prince Edward Island at 58%.&lt;ref name="conferenceboard_2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/provincial/economy/labour-productivity.aspx |title=Labour Productivity Growth |work=The Conference Board of Canada |date=2017 |access-date=November 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article noted that over previous five year period, Canada "outperformed" the US on "labour productivity growth".&lt;ref name="conferenceboard_2017"/&gt; In May 2018, Statistics Canada reported that across Canada, labor productivity rose 2.2%; the increase in 2016 was 0.6%.&lt;ref name="statcan_2018_productivity"&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/180523/dq180523a-eng.htm |title=Hours worked and labour productivity in the provinces and territories (preliminary), 2017 |date=May 23, 2018  |access-date=November 3, 2018 |publisher=Statistics Canada |quote="Labour productivity is a measure of real gross domestic product per hour worked. Productivity gains occur when the production of goods and services grows faster than the volume of work dedicated to their production...Economic performance, as measured by labour productivity, must be interpreted carefully, as these data reflect changes in other inputs, in particular capital, in addition to the efficiency growth of production processes. As well, growth in labour productivity is often influenced by the degree of diversity in the industrial structure. As a result, labour productivity tends to be more volatile in the smaller provinces."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===

According to a 2004 article, Canadian workers were estimated to be 82% as productive per hour as their American counterparts.&lt;ref name="ideas_2004"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/sls/ipmsls/v9y20041.html|title=Measuring the Canada-U.S. Productivity Gap: Industry Dimensions|first1=Someshwar|last1=Rao|first2=Jianmin|last2=Tang|first3=Weimin|last3=Wang|date=2004|journal=International Productivity Monitor|volume=9|pages=3–14 |access-date=November 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industries with the largest productivity advantages for the US are the [[manufacturing]] (particularly [[electronics]] and [[computer]]), [[finance]], and [[Service Sector|service]] sectors. Industries where Canada is more productive than the US are the [[construction]] and [[natural resources]] sectors with Canadian workers achieving 129% relative productivity.&lt;ref name="ideas_2004"/&gt;

The productivity gap was even larger in the 1950s but the difference narrowed, aided by the elimination of the smaller market problem through free trade. The gap closed somewhat in the 1980s but at a much slower pace than in the 1960s. From 1961 to 1973 labour productivity rose annually by 3.3 percent in Canada and 1.7 percent in the United States. According to a 1997 IMF report, from 1973 to 1995 productivity growth was 1.1% in Canada and 0.8% in the United States.&lt;ref name="IMF_Salgado_1997"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1997/12/pdf/salgado.pdf |title= Productivity Growth in Canada and the United States |first=Ranil |last=Salgado |date= December 1997 |access-date= November 3, 2018 |website= www.imf.org |format=PDF |pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The productivity gap began to widen again in the 1990s, particularly in the manufacturing sector. According to a 2005 article, by 2000, this was called Canada's "Excellence Gap" by the Chief Economist of Canadian Manufacturers &amp; Exporters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cme-mec.ca/national/documents/Excellence_Gap.pdf Microsoft Word - Excellence Gap.DOC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029064115/http://www.cme-mec.ca/national/documents/Excellence_Gap.pdf |date=2005-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States has the second-highest productivity of the [[G8]] countries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.aber.ac.uk/sbj5/economy.htm New Page 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103171844/http://users.aber.ac.uk/sbj5/economy.htm |date=2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Canada's is 5th based on the 1997 estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/pics/pr/livstand.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303150527/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/pics/pr/livstand.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five main reasons for the productivity gap: the lower capital intensity of economic activity in Canada; an innovation gap in Canada relative to the United States; Canada's relatively underdeveloped high-tech sector; less developed human capital in Canada in terms of proportionately fewer university graduates and scientists and engineers in research and development; and more limited economies of scale and scope in Canada.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Australia==
In 1984 [[Geoffrey Blainey]], an Australian historian and academic said in response to the prediction of the "increasing Asianisation" of Australia made by Labor's Immigration Minister [[Stewart West]], "I do not accept the view, widely held in the Federal Cabinet, that some kind of slow Asian takeover of Australia is inevitable. I do not believe that we are powerless. I do believe that we can with good will and good sense control our destiny.... As a people, we seem to move from extreme to extreme. In the past 30 years the government of Australia has moved from the extreme of wanting a white Australia to the extreme of saying that we will have an Asian Australia and that the quicker we move towards it the better".&lt;ref&gt;Source: The Age, 20 March 1984&lt;/ref&gt;


In the 1996 election [[Pauline Hanson]] was elected to the federal seat of [[Division of Oxley|Oxley]]. In her controversial maiden speech to the House of Representatives, she expressed her belief that Australia "was in danger of being swamped by [[Asians]]". Hanson went on to form the [[One Nation Party]], which initially won nearly one quarter of the vote in [[Queensland]] state elections before entering a period of decline due to internal disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Goot |first = Murray | title = Pauline Hanson's One Nation: extreme right, centre party or extreme left? | journal = Labour History | volume = 89 |issue = 89 | pages = 101–119 | publisher = Australian Society for the Study of Labour History (ASSLH) | doi = 10.2307/27516078 | jstor = 27516078 | date = November 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/27516078 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "One Nation" was meant to signify national unity, in contrast to what Hanson claimed to see as an increasing division in Australian society caused by government policies favouring migrants (multiculturalism) and indigenous Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Ben-Moshe |first = Danny | title = One Nation and the Australian far right | journal = [[Patterns of Prejudice]] | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 24–40 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/003132201128811205 | date = July 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/003132201128811205 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th and 20th centuries (until the 1960s), the French-speaking Catholic minority of Canada managed to maintain its share of the population due to a high birth rate, dubbed the "revenge of the cradle."

==Estonia==
In [[Estonia]], one of the causes of the [[Singing Revolution]] was the concern over the demographic threat to the national identity posed by the influx of individuals from foreign ethnic groups to work on such large Soviet development projects as phosphate mining.&lt;ref&gt;Estonia and the Estonians,  Toivo U.

Many [[Hindu]] [[Indian people|Indians]] see Muslims as a "demographic threat" because of their large population growth due to high fertility rates&lt;ref&gt;Women, States, and Nationalism: At Home in the Nation?, By Sita Ranchod-Nilsson, Mary Ann Tétreault,  Routledge, 2000, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and because of the high rate of illegal immigration from [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;Why India is concerned about Bangladesh, Ramananda Sengupta | December 22, 2005 [http://in.rediff.com/cms/print.jsp?docpath=//news/2005/dec/22bspec.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'' Mohajir's Pakistan,''  M.K.

==Israel==
In the 1950s, Shoham Melamad found that the high fertility rate of Arabs was viewed as a demographic threat to the Jewish nation.&lt;ref name=Shenhav191&gt;Shenhav, 2006, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], however, stated that Arabs in Israel should be treated equally to any other Israeli citizens and be allowed to have children just like any other citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/924953 Does A High Arab Birthrate Threaten Israel?]&lt;/ref&gt; A 1967 ''[[Maariv_(newspaper)|Maariv]]'' editorial  suggested that Jews should be encouraged to have large families, while [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and in Israel should be encouraged to adopt [[birth control]] measures. Schnitzer also advocated for the adoption of an open policy encouraging Arabs to emigrate from Israel.&lt;ref name=Masalha&gt;Masalha, 2000, pp. 200-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] opined that if the percentage of [[Arab citizens of Israel]] rises above its current level of about 20 percent, Israel would not be able to retain a Jewish demographic majority, the basis of Israel's self-definition as a "Jewish democratic state". Netanyahu's comments were criticized as racist by Arab [[Knesset]] members and the [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/netanyahu-israel-s-arabs-are-the-real-demographic-threat-1.109045 |title=Netanyahu: Israel's Arabs are the real demographic threat |date=18 December 2003 |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |author=Sedan, Gil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/mks-slam-netanyahu-s-remarks-about-israeli-arabs-1.108963 |title=MKs slam Netanyahu's remarks about Israeli Arabs |date=17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, [[Michael Oren]] wrote an article in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' in which he discussed the "Arab Demographic Threat" as one of "Seven Existential Threats" facing Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/seven-existential-threats-15124 |title=Seven Existential Threats |publisher=www.commentarymagazine.com |accessdate=2009-05-13 |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508143226/http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/seven-existential-threats-15124 |archivedate=2009-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Shimon Peres told US officials that Israel had "lost" land in the Negev "to the Bedouin" and would need to take steps to "relieve" the "demographic threat".

==Northern Ireland==
{{Main|Politics of Northern Ireland#Political demography}}
In [[Northern Ireland]], Protestants are more likely to favour continued political union with the UK, while Catholics are more likely to favour political union with the rest of Ireland. When Ireland was partitioned in the 1920s and Northern Ireland came into existence, Protestants were roughly 60% of the population, but as a result of higher fertility rates among Catholics, their share of the population has dropped to less than 50% in the 2011 census, while Catholics numbered only slightly fewer than Protestants. There is debate over whether and to what extent this trend will continue and its possible impact on the political situation.

==Russia==
Russia fears the "demographic threat" posed by the potential for "large-scale Chinese immigration" to its thinly populated far east.&lt;ref&gt;Russia's Far East: a region at risk

Ziegler,  University of Washington Press, 2002, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;  Illegal immigration of Chinese nationals is a special concern.&lt;ref&gt;Security and Migration in Asia: The Dynamics of Securitisation, By Melissa Curley, Siu-lun Wong,  Taylor &amp; Francis, 2007, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{POV section|date=June 2018}}
Some in the United States have expressed concern about the "demographic threat" posed by millions of migrants from [[Mexico]] and [[Latin America]] and their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Keeping Out the Other: A Critical Introduction to Immigration Enforcement Today, David Brotherton, Philip Kretsedemas, Columbia University Press, 2008, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Migration Stock]] is the number of people that live in an area that they were not originally from and [[Migration Flow]] is the number of new people entering a new territory. It is important to know the difference because the main issue that is associated with immigration is the migration flow of new people entering United States. In the distant future, around 2050, the United States will be a diverse country and whites will no longer be the majority. The future economy for United States will depend heavily on the future immigrants that come to the [[United States]], according to Joel Kotkin.&lt;ref&gt;The Changing Demographics of America. (2010, August 01). Retrieved March 27, 2018, from https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/the-changing-demographics-of-america-538284/&lt;/ref&gt; United States has a high amount of debt and it does not look like it will reduce soon. Changing the immigration system to a more flexible system can help the U.S. future economy. So why the scare? It has always been thought that the more [[immigration]] there is the fewer [[Primary sector]] jobs for the population that was born in the United States.  However according to Diana Furchtgott-Roth this statement is a fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;The Economic Benefits of Immigration. (2016, March 08). Retrieved March 27, 2018, from https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/economic-benefits-immigration-5712.html&lt;/ref&gt; The United States can benefit from the immigration because they can use the migrants for [[Secondary sector]] jobs that mainly consist of intense labor that requires no skills. It does not ruin the opportunity but in turn actually raises the wages for working class Americans. If the stigma that immigration ruins the chances for working Americans ends and the United States puts in place more flexible immigration laws then the United States might see a brighter future with a better economy.

Sweden's main statistics bureau [[Statistics Sweden]] (SCB) does not keep any record of ethnicity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/faktakoll-rott-ljus-for-reinfeldt_7203940.svd|title=Faktakoll: Rött ljus för Reinfeldt|author=Jenny Stiernstedt|website=Svd.se|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but about 20% of Sweden's population is of foreign background.&lt;ref name="SCB1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____26041.aspx|title=Summary of Population Statistics 1960 - 2012|work=Statistics Sweden|date=2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012043524/http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____26041.aspx|archivedate=12 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some immigrants in Sweden feel that they experience "betweenship" which arises when others ascribe them an identity that they do not hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:440638|title=Mellanförskap - svenskhet, ursprung och invandrarskap|first=Nikula,|last=Johan|date=16 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing numbers of immigrants has coincided with the rise of the anti-immigration political party [[Sweden Democrats]] which expresses fear of a
[[demographic threat]], especially the rise of [[Islam in Sweden]]. Since the 1990s, polls show that people in Sweden have gradually become more positive to asylum refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://som.gu.se/digitalAssets/1467/1467499_svensk-migrationspolitisk-opinion-2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924103701/http://www.som.gu.se/digitalAssets/1467/1467499_svensk-migrationspolitisk-opinion-2.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the Sweden Democrats have become one of the most popular parties in Sweden which has sparked widespread debate about a possible increase of xenophobia and [[racism in Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.se/nyheter/yougov-nu-ar-sd-sveriges-storsta-parti/EVHohs!MfmMZjCjQQzJs/|title=Yougov: Nu är SD Sveriges största parti|website=Metro.se|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3502">'''Electrical system design''' is the design of [[Electricity|electrical]] [[systems]].  This can be as simple as a [[Battery (electricity)|flashlight cell]] connected through two [[wire]]s to a [[light bulb]] or as involved as the [[space shuttle]]. Electrical systems are groups of electrical components connected to carry out some operation. Often the systems are combined with other systems. They might be subsystems of larger systems and have subsystems of their own. For example, a subway [[rapid transit]] electrical system is composed of the wayside electrical power supply, wayside control system, and the electrical systems of each transit car. Each transit car’s electrical system is a subsystem of the subway system. Inside of each transit car there are also subsystems, such as the car climate control system.

==Design==
The following would be appropriate for the design of a moderate to large electrical system.
# A [[specification]] document is written. It probably would have been written by the customer. The specification document states in plain language and numerical detail what the customer expects. If it is well written, it will be used as a reference throughout the electrical system design.
# A [[functional specification]] (design) document that goes into more technical details may be created. It uses the specification document as its basis. Here calculations may be used or referenced to support design decisions.
# Functional diagrams may be made. These use block diagrams indicating information and electrical power flow from component to component. They are similar to the [[functional flow block diagram]]s used with computer programs.
# [[Schematic]] diagrams showing the electrical interconnections between the components are made. They may not show all the conductors and termination points. Except for [[one-line diagram]]s, this should show all the [[circuit nodes]]. One-line diagrams represent the three or four conductors of three-phase power circuits with one line.
# [[Wiring diagram]]s are sometimes made. These show and name the termination points and names of each conductor. In some systems enough information can be put onto the schematics so that wiring diagrams are not needed.
# Physically smaller systems that are built many times may use a [[cable harness]]. A full-sized to-scale wiring diagram can be made of a cable harness. This wiring diagram can then be laid on a peg board and used to guide the construction of more cable harnesses. Harnesses can be inserted into their equipment as an assembly. Cable harnesses that are reused many times, '''like''' automobile wiring harnesses, are created with automated machinery.
# A wire list is made in [[spreadsheet]] or list format. It shows the electrical assembly people what wires are to be connected and to where. When it is printed out on paper, it is easy for the assembly people to check off conductors as they are connected. The wire list contains at a minimum each wire name, terminal name, and wire model number or gage. It may also contain the wire termination device model numbers, voltage classes, conductor class (high-voltage, medium voltage, or control wiring), etc.

[[File:Everyman's Library in its different incarnations.jpeg|thumb|(click on thumbnail to view the image in its original size) Different incarnations of Everyman's Library throughout history. Left to right: the original J. M. Dent hardback with its distinctive yellow dust jacket, an early example of an Everyman Paperback also published by Dent from the 1960s, the present design of Everyman paperbacks published by Dent since the 1990s, an example of the initial 'plain' hardback Everyman volume published by David Campbell, an updated version of Campbell's Everyman hardbacks with a striated front cover and orange spine with black band.]]

'''Everyman's Library''' is a series of reprint of classic literature, primarily from the [[Western canon]]. It is currently published in hardback by [[Random House]]. It was originally an imprint of [[J. M. Dent]] (latterly a division of [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] and presently an imprint of Orion Books), who continue to publish '''Everyman Paperbacks'''.
==History== 
Everyman's Library was conceived in 1905 by [[London]] publisher [[Joseph Malaby Dent]], whose goal was to create a 1,000 volume library of world literature that was affordable for, and that appealed to, every kind of person, from students to the working classes to the cultural elite. Dent followed the design principles and to a certain extent the style established by [[William Morris]] in his Kelmscott Press. This was later replaced in 1935 by [[Eric Ravilious]]'s designs.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Sigfrid Henry (1961) ''Five Hundred Years of Printing''; 2nd ed. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books; pp. 356-60&lt;/ref&gt; Everyman's Library books were pocket-sized [[hardcover]]s that sold initially for what was then the remarkably low price of a [[shilling]] apiece. The original [[United States|U.S.]] distribution rights were granted to [[New York City]] publishers, [[E. P. Dutton]].

The name of the publication series was suggested by [[poet]] and [[editing|editor]] [[Ernest Rhys]], who was named head editor of the series initially, and asked to find a suitable name to encompass Dent's goal. Rhys tried and discarded many ideas before recalling a quotation from the [[medieval]] play ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'' in which the character of Knowledge says to Everyman:
:''Everyman, I will go with thee''
:''and be thy guide,''
:''In thy most need to go''
:''by thy side.''
This quotation appears on the title page of all Everyman's Library and Everyman Paperbacks volumes. 

J. M. Dent and Company commenced the series in 1906 with a [[James Boswell]]'s ''[[Life of Johnson]]'', published with a quotation on the title page from the works of [[John Milton]]: "A good book is the precious life-blood of a master-spirit, embalmed and treasured upon purpose to a life beyond life." In 1910, 500 books had been published under the Everyman trademark, and in 1956, fulfilling Dent's original goal, the thousandth volume, [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics]]'', having been selected for the honor, was published.

By 1975, Dent's vision had been well surpassed, as Everyman's Library consisted of 994 titles published in 1,239 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knopfdoubleday.com/about About Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group] Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group (retrieved 10 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Each book belonged to one of the following genres: Travel, Science, Fiction, Theology &amp; Philosophy, History, Classical, For Young People, Essays, Oratory, Poetry &amp; Drama, Biography, Reference, and Romance. The appropriate genre was printed inside and used to organize the periodically released lists of the series.&lt;ref&gt;''Atlas of Ancient &amp; Classical Geography''. London: Dent, 1907; prelims.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After ceasing publication of new titles in the 1970s, the hardback rights to Everyman's Library were sold to the newly formed David Campbell Publishers in 1991 and relaunched with the support of the Random House Group in the [[United Kingdom]] and through Alfred A. Knopf (which had been acquired by Random House in 1960)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/about/history.html About Us] Random House (retrieved 10 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States, a move praised by many notable authors. Control of Everyman's Library passed to US-based Random House in 2002, who continue to publish it under the Knopf Publishers imprint there and (albeit without changes) as Random House UK elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-miscellaneous/4656548-1.html Knopf snaps up Everyman's Library] Bookseller, 15 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  

J. M. Dent &amp; Sons was acquired by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in 1988, itself acquired by the [[Orion Publishing Group]] in 1991, now both part of [[Hachette Livre]] (UK). Orion continues to publish the unrelated Everyman Paperbacks under the J. M. Dent imprint in the UK and via [[Tuttle Publishing|Charles E. Tuttle Co.]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/history.aspx About Orion] Orion Publishing Group (retrieved 10 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Everyman's Encyclopedia'' ==
{{main|Everyman's Encyclopaedia}}
A notable addition to the library was a multi-volume encyclopedia, which was added to the range in 1913. Individual volumes could be purchased separately, enabling the set to be budgeted over time. The fifth edition was published in 1967, by which time it consisted of 12 volumes, containing 7763 pages.

The page size was {{convert|9|by|5|in|cm}}, but as the printing was 8 point, a large amount of information was contained in each volume. As a volume only weighed about 1.25 kg (2.75 lbs), it was considered a better size for use by children.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

'''Hadj Boudella''' is a citizen of Bosnia who was wrongfully detained for over six years in the [[United States]] [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]]s, in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=DoDList2&gt;

He was born in [[Algeria]], moved to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], married [[Nađa Dizdarević]] a Bosnian woman, and became a Bosnian citizen. Boudella, and five associates of his, who were also Algeria-born Bosnians were arrested by Bosnian authorities.  Local [[United States]] [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] officials said they detected "[[Chatter (terrorist)|chatter]]" that implicated the six in a conspiracy to bomb the US embassy in Bosnia.

He won his [[habeas corpus]] and [[US District Court Judge]] [[Richard J. Leon]] wrote that there was no evidence that Boudella intended to travel to Afghanistan to take up arms against [[US forces]]. Judge Leon declared Boudella's detention as unlawful and ordered his release in November 2008. He was released from Guantanamo and returned to his family in Bosnia on December 16, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2008/12/18/freed-bosnian-calls-guantanamo-the-worst-place-in-the-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hirsau kloster 5.jpg|thumb|300px|Ruins of Hirsau Abbey]]
'''Hirsau Abbey''', formerly known as '''Hirschau Abbey''', was once one of the most important [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[abbey]]s of [[Germany]]. It is located in the [[Hirsau]] borough of [[Calw]] on the northern slopes of the [[Black Forest]] mountain range, in the present-day state of [[Baden-Württemberg]]. In the 11th and 12th century, the monastery was a centre of the [[Cluniac Reforms]], implemented as "Hirsau Reforms" in the German lands. The complex was devastated during the [[Nine Years' War|War of the Palatine Succession]] in 1692 and not rebuilt.

==History==
===St Aurelius===
A [[Christianization|Christian]] chapel at Hirsau dedicated to Saint [[Nazarius and Celsus|Nazarius]] had already been erected in the late 8th century. The monastery itself was founded in about 830 by the [[Rhenish Franconia|Rhenish Franconian]] count Erlafried of Calw at the instigation of his relative, Bishop Notting of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vercelli|Vercelli]], who gave it the relics of Saint [[Aurelius of Riditio]], an [[Armenians|Armenian]] bishop who had died about 475, brought from [[Milan]] among other treasures; they were first placed in the oratory of St. Nazarius' Chapel, while the monastery at Hirsau was being built on the count's estates. It was settled by a colony of fifteen monks descending from [[Fulda Abbey]], disciples of [[Rabanus Maurus]] and [[Walafrid Strabo]], under one abbot Liudebert or Lutpert. Count Erlafried endowed the new foundation with extended lands and other gifts, and made a solemn donation of the whole into the hands of Lutpert, on condition that the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] should be observed. A first [[aisleless church]], dedicated to Saint Aurelius, was not completed until 838, when it was consecrated by Archbishop [[Odgar|Odgar of Mainz]], who at the same time translated the relics from their temporary resting place to the new church. 
[[File:Hirsau kloster 6.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Belltower]]
Abbot Lutpert died in 853, having brought about a substantial increase both in the possessions of the abbey and in the number of the monks under his rule. Regular observance flourished under him and his successors and a successful [[monastic school]] was established. Over about a hundred and fifty years, under the care of the Counts of Calw, it enjoyed great prosperity, and became an important seat of learning. However, towards the end of the 10th century the ravages of pestilence, combined with the greed of its patrons and the laxity of the community, brought it to ruin. In 988 a severe plague devastated the neighbourhood and carried off sixty of the monks including the abbot, Hartfried. Only a dozen were left to elect a successor, and they divided into two parties. The more fervent chose one Conrad, whose election was confirmed by the [[Bishopric of Speyer|Bishop of Speyer]], but some of the others, who favoured a more relaxed rule, elected an opposition abbot in the person of Eberhard, the cellarer. For some time the dispute ran high between the rival superiors and their respective followers. The Count of Calw supported the claims of Eberhard, but neither party would give way to the other and in the end the count brought in an armed force to settle the quarrel. The result was that the abbey was pillaged, the monks dispersed, and the valuable library destroyed. The count became master of the property and the abbey remained empty for over sixty years, during which time the buildings fell into a ruinous state.

In 1049 [[Pope Leo IX]], uncle of Count Adalbert of Calw and grandson of the spoliator, came to Hirschau, and required Adalbert to restore the abbey. The count had the abbey church rebuilt in the style of a Roman [[basilica]] with an attached [[cloister]]: He renovated the premises, but so slowly that they were not refurbished until 1065, when the monastery was resettled by a dozen monks from the renowned [[Einsiedeln Abbey]] in [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]], with Abbot Frederick at their head.

===Sts Peter and Paul===
[[File:Hirsau Wappenrelief.jpg|thumb|The ''Hirsch'' (deer) on the abbey's coat of arms]]
It was however Frederick's successor who revived and even surpassed the former renown and prosperity of the abbey. This was the famous [[William of Hirsau]], a monk descending from [[St. Emmeram's Abbey]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] capital [[Regensburg]], who was appointed abbot in 1069. When he came the condition of the monastery was far from satisfactory. The monks were living in cramped conditions, as the buildings were still incomplete and furthermore repeatedly affected by floods of the [[Nagold (river)|Nagold]] river. Count Adalbert still retained possession of some of the monastic property, together with a certain amount of unhelpful influence over the community, and regular discipline was very much relaxed. Abbot William's zeal and prudence by degrees remedied this unsatisfactory state of affairs and inaugurated a period of great prosperity, both spiritual and temporal. During the [[Investiture Controversy]] that shook the [[Holy Roman Empire]], he secured the independence of the abbey from the Counts of Calw and placed its finances on a sound footing.

William completed the buildings already begun and from 1082 afterwards greatly added to them, as the needs of the increasing community required, a new monastery complex on a high plateau on the opposite side of the Nagold river. The Sts [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]]'s abbey church, which was modelled on [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny II]] finished about 981 under Abbot [[Majolus of Cluny|Majolus]], was consecrated in 1091. The [[convent]] followed the next year, when it moved into the adjacent new monastic compound designed according to the [[Plan of Saint Gall]], while old St Aurelius was converted into a [[prior]]y. William also refounded the monastic school for which the abbey had formerly been famous throughout Germany.

But the abbot's greatest work, perhaps, and that for which his name is best remembered, was the reformation that he effected within the community itself. [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] was then at the height of its fame and William sent some of his monks there to learn the Cluniac customs and rule, after which the Cluniac discipline was introduced at Hirsau. By his ''Constitutiones Hirsaugienses'', a new [[religious order]], the ''Ordo Hirsaugiensis'', was formed. Known as the [[William of Hirsau|Hirsau Reforms]], the adoption of this rule revitalised Benedictine monasteries throughout Germany, such as those of [[Zwiefalten Abbey|Zwiefalten]], [[Blaubeuren Abbey|Blaubeuren]] [[Petershausen Abbey|Petershausen]], [[Abbey of Saint Peter in the Black Forest|Saint Peter]] and [[St. George's Abbey in the Black Forest|Saint George in the Black Forest]] in Swabia, as well as the Thuringian monastery of [[Reinhardsbrunn]], Franconian [[Comburg]] and [[St. Paul's Abbey in the Lavanttal]] in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]. Hirsau priories were located at [[Reichenbach Priory|Reichenbach]] and [[Schönrain Priory|Schönrain]], in Bavarian [[Fischbachau]] and Thuringian [[Rottenbach, Thuringia|Paulinzella]].

A friend and correspondent of [[Pope Gregory VII]] and Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]], William took active part in the politico-ecclesiastical controversies of his time. He was also author of ''inter alia'' the treatise ''De musica et tonis'', as well as the ''Philosophicarum et astronomicarism institutionuin libri iii''. The abbot then wrote his well-known "Consuetudines Hirsaugienses"&lt;ref&gt;P. L., CL, and Herrgott, "Vetus Disciplina Monastica",&lt;/ref&gt; which for several centuries remained the standard of monastic observance. Under William monks were sent out from Hirsau to reform other German monasteries on the same lines, and from it seven new monasteries were founded. The numbers of the community increased to 150 under his rule, manual labour and the copying of manuscripts forming an important part of their occupations. Numerous exemptions and other privileges were obtained from time to time from emperors and popes.

In the twelfth century the autocratic rule of Abbot Manegold caused for a time some internal dissensions and a consequent decline of strict discipline, but the vigorous efforts of several  abbots checked the decadence, and temporarily re-established the stricter observance. About the end of the 12th century Hirsau Abbey was again very perceptibly on the decline both materially and morally. It never afterwards again rose into importance.

In the fifteenth century, however, the famous "Customs" gradually became little more than a dead letter. Wolfram, the thirty-eighth abbot (1428–1460), introduced the contemporary [[Melk Reform]]. A few years later Hirsau adopted the Constitutions of [[Bursfelde Abbey]] and became part of the [[Bursfelde Congregation]]. Wolfram's successor, Bernhard, carried on the work of revival, freed the abbey from its debts, restored the monastic buildings, and also reformed several other monasteries.

In the days of Abbot John III (1514–1556) Hirsau fell on hard times: the [[Protestant Reformation]] began to make its influence felt, and after a brief period of struggle, the abbey, through the involvement of Duke [[Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg|Ulrich of Württemberg]], passed into Lutheran hands, though still maintaining its monastic character. In consequence of the Reformation it was secularized in 1558. In 1630 it became Catholic again for a short time, but after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) it once more came under the control of the Dukes of Württemberg and another series of Lutheran abbots presided over it.

The community eventually came to an end and the once famous Hirsau Abbey was finally destroyed during the [[Nine Years' War]] by [[Early modern France|French]] troops under General Lieutenant [[Ezéchiel du Mas, Comte de Mélac|Mélac]] in 1692. Only the ruins now remain to mark its site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8944">'''ISO 25964''' is the international standard for [[thesauri]], published in two parts as follows:
     '''''ISO 25964''''' '' Information and documentation - Thesauri and interoperability with other vocabularies''
          ''Part 1: Thesauri for information retrieval''     [published August 2011]
          ''Part 2: Interoperability with other vocabularies''     [published March 2013]

It was issued by [[ISO]], the International Organization for Standardization, and its official website &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niso.org/schemas/iso25964 ''ISO 25964 – the international standard for thesauri and [[interoperability]] with other vocabularies'']&lt;/ref&gt; is maintained by its secretariat in [[NISO]], the USA National Information Standards Organization. Each part of the standard can be purchased separately from ISO or from any of its national member bodies (such as [[ANSI]], [[British Standards Institution|BSI]], [[AFNOR]], [[DIN]], etc.). Some parts of it are available free of charge from the official website.

== History ==
The first international standard for thesauri was [[ISO 2788]], ''Guidelines for the establishment and development of monolingual thesauri'', originally published in 1974 and updated in 1986. In 1985 it was joined by the complementary standard [[ISO 5964]], ''Guidelines for the establishment and development of multilingual thesauri''.
Over the years ISO 2788 and ISO 5964 were adopted as national standards in several countries, for example Canada, France and UK. In the UK they were given alias numbers BS 5723 and BS 6723 respectively. And it was in the UK around the turn of the century that work began to revise them for the networking needs of the new millennium. This resulted during 2005 - 2008 in publication of the 5-part British Standard BS 8723, as follows:
     ''BS 8723 Structured vocabularies for information retrieval - Guide''
          ''Part 1: Definitions, symbols and abbreviations''
          ''Part 2: Thesauri''
          ''Part 3: Vocabularies other than thesauri''
          ''Part 4: Interoperability between vocabularies''
          ''Part 5: Exchange formats and protocols for interoperability''
Even before the last part of BS 8723 was published, work began to adopt and adapt it as an international standard to replace ISO 2788 and ISO 5964. The project was led by a Working Group of ISO's Technical Committee 46 (Information and documentation) Subcommittee 9 (Identification and description) known as “ISO TC46/SC9/WG8 Structured Vocabularies”.

ISO 2788 and ISO 5964 were withdrawn in 2011, when they were replaced by the first part of ISO 25964. The second part of ISO 25964 was issued in March 2013, completing the project.

==Aims and Scope==
ISO 25964 is for thesauri intended to support [[information retrieval]], and specifically to guide the choice of terms used in indexing, [[tagging]]{{dn|date=June 2018}} and search queries.

The primary objective is thus summarised in the introduction to the standard as:
{{Quote box
 |quote  = "If both the indexer and the searcher are guided to choose the same term for the same concept, then relevant documents will be retrieved."
 |width  = 85%
 |align  = center
}}

Whereas most of the applications envisaged for ISO 2788 and ISO 5964 were databases in a single domain, often in-house or for paper-based systems, ISO 25964 provides additional guidance for the new context of networked applications, including the [[Semantic Web]]. A thesaurus is one among several types of controlled vocabulary used in this context.

=== ISO 25964 Part 1 ===
A thesaurus compliant with ISO 25964-1 (as Part 1 is known) lists all the concepts available for indexing in a given context, and labels each of them with a preferred term, as well as any synonyms that apply. Relationships between the concepts and between the terms are shown, making it easy to navigate around the field while building up a search query. The main types of relationship include:
* equivalence (between synonyms and near-synonyms e.g. motor-bikes, motor-cycles and motorcycles)
* hierarchical (between broader and narrower concepts e.g. flowers and roses)
* associative (between concepts that are closely related in some non-hierarchical way, e.g. between a disease and the virus that causes that disease)
In multilingual thesauri equivalence also applies between corresponding terms in different natural languages. Establishing correspondence is not always easy, and the standard provides recommendations for handling the difficulties that commonly arise.

ISO 25964-1 explains how to build a monolingual or a multilingual thesaurus, how to display it, and how to manage its development. There is a data model to use for handling thesaurus data (especially when exchanging data between systems) and an XML schema for encoding the data. Both the model and the schema can be accessed 24/7, free of charge, on the official website hosted by NISO. The standard also sets out the features you should look for when choosing software to manage the thesaurus.

=== ISO 25964 Part 2 ===
ISO 25964-2 deals with the challenges of using one thesaurus in combination with another, and/or with some other type of controlled vocabulary or [[knowledge organization system]] (KOS). The types covered include [[classification scheme]]s, [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]], [[Subject heading|subject heading schemes]], [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]], [[Authority lists|name authority lists]], [[Terminology|terminologies]] and [[synonym ring]]s. Within a single organization it is common to find several different such KOSs used in contexts such as the records management system, the library catalogue, the corporate intranet, the research lab, etc. To help users with the challenge of running a single search across all the available collections, ISO 25964-2 provides guidance on mapping between the terms and concepts of one thesaurus and those of the other KOSs. Where mapping is not a sensible option, the standard recommends other forms of complementary vocabulary use.

Similarly on the Internet there is an opportunity to make a simultaneous search of repositories and databases that have been indexed with different KOSs, on an even wider scale. Interoperability between the different networks, platforms, software applications, and languages (both natural and artificial) is reliant on the adoption of numerous protocols and standards. ISO 25964-2 is the one to address interoperability between structured vocabularies, especially where a thesaurus is involved.

== Related standards ==
Since Part 1 of ISO 25964 was published it has been adopted by the national standards bodies in a number of countries. For example, The British Standards Institution (BSI) in the UK has adopted it and labelled it unchanged as BS ISO 25964-1. At the time of writing similar consideration is under way for Part 2.
The American standard ANSI/NISO Z39.19 - ''Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies'' covers some of the same ground as ISO 25964-1. It deals with monolingual lists, synonym rings and taxonomies as well as thesauri, but does not provide a data model, nor address multilingual vocabularies or other aspects of interoperability, such as mapping between KOSs. Where the two standards overlap, they are broadly compatible with each other.  NISO is actively involved in both standards, having participated in the work of developing ISO 25964 as well as running its secretariat.
The W3C  Recommendation ''SKOS ([[Simple Knowledge Organization System]])'' has a close relationship with ISO 25964 in the context of the Semantic Web. ''SKOS'' applies to all sorts of “simple KOSs” that can be found on the Web, including thesauri and others. Whereas ISO 25964-1 advises on the selection and fitting together of concepts, terms and relationships to make a good thesaurus, ''SKOS'' addresses the next step - porting the thesaurus to the Web. And whereas ISO 25964-2 recommends the sort of mappings that can be established between one KOS and another, ''SKOS'' presents a way of expressing the mappings when published to the Web.

{{Details|Baconian method}}
'''''Idola specus''''' (singular '''''Idolum specus'''''), normally translated as "'''Idols of the Cave'''" (or "'''Idols of the Den'''"), is a type of logical [[fallacy]] whereby the peculiar biases of individuals lead them to errors. This [[Latin]] term was coined by Sir [[Francis Bacon]] and used in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the logic and method of [[modern science]]. He described them as deriving from "the peculiar constitution, mental or bodily, of each individual; and also in education, habit, and accident".&lt;ref name=LIII&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Aphorism LIII&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''idola specus'' are [[prejudice]]s, by which individuals inappropriately extend norms or tenets that derive his or her own culture and social group, or to his or her own preferences. [[Racism]], [[sexism]] and, more generally just "[[biases]]" are examples of ''idola specus'', but the concept goes beyond them to the criticism of all forms of irreflexive [[subjectivity]] or individual predisposition.

The term is one of four such "idols" which represent "idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance is obtained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Aphorism XXXVIII&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides ''idola specus'', there are also ''[[idola tribus]]'' (Idols of the Tribe, caused by human nature), ''[[idola fori]]'', (Idols of the Market Place, caused by language) and ''[[idola theatri]]'' (Idols of the Theatre, which are caused by the influence of philosophers).

{{Quotation|The Idols of the Cave are the idols of the individual man. For everyone (besides the errors common to human nature in general) has a cave or den of his own, which refracts and discolors the light of nature, owing either to his own proper and peculiar nature; or to his education and conversation with others; or to the reading of books, and the authority of those whom he esteems and admires; or to the differences of impressions, accordingly as they take place in a mind preoccupied and predisposed or in a mind indifferent and settled; or the like. So that the spirit of man (according as it is meted out to different individuals) is in fact a thing variable and full of perturbation, and governed as it were by chance. Whence it was well observed by Heraclitus that men look for sciences in their own lesser worlds, and not in the greater or common world.|''[[Novum Organum]]'', Aphorism XLII}}

In more detail, Bacon said that there are a "great number and variety" of idols of the cave but he choose to select example which give "the most important caution", and which "have most effect in disturbing the clearness of the understanding".&lt;ref name=LIII/&gt; He judged that they "grow for the most part either out of the predominance of a favorite subject, or out of an excessive tendency to compare or to distinguish, or out of partiality for particular ages, or out of the largeness or minuteness of the objects contemplated."&lt;ref name=LVIII&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Aphorism LVIII&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning these most important variants he wrote in more detail:

*One common reason for a prejudice is that people "become attached to certain particular sciences and speculations, either because they fancy themselves the authors and inventors thereof, or because they have bestowed the greatest pains upon them and become most habituated to them."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Aphorism LIV&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bacon remarks that with respect to philosophy and science, there are two radically different types of minds. These manifest ''idola specus'' in different ways, but both suffer from it. Some "steady and acute" minds are "stronger and apter to mark the differences of things", fixing upon "the subtlest distinctions". Others are "lofty and discursive" and more prone to mark resemblances, recognizing and putting together "the finest and most general resemblances". "Both kinds, however, easily err in excess, by catching the one at gradations, the other at shadows."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Aphorism LV&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bacon also notes another distinction which causes different manifestations of ''idola specus'': "There are found some minds given to an extreme admiration of antiquity, others to an extreme love and appetite for novelty; but few so duly tempered that they can hold the mean, neither carping at what has been well laid down by the ancients, nor despising what is well introduced by the moderns. "&lt;ref&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Aphorism LVI&lt;/ref&gt;
*Finally, another common cause of ''idola specus'' when looking specifically at "contemplations of nature" is that this sometimes requires looking at things in their "simple form". This break ups and distracts the understanding. Bacon mentions [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] as compared with the other philosophies. For that school is so busied with the particles that it hardly attends to the structure. On the other hand, "contemplations of nature and bodies in their composition and configuration overpower and dissolve the understanding". And some contemplators of nature become "so lost in admiration of the structure that they do not penetrate to the simplicity of nature". As a way of avoiding these problems, Bacon recommends that these two types of contemplation should be "alternated and taken by turns, so that the understanding may be rendered at once penetrating and comprehensive, and the inconveniences above mentioned, with the idols which proceed from them, may be avoided".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Aphorism LVII&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon also drew general advice for more methodical future study of nature, aimed at avoiding the idols of the cave: "generally let every student of nature take this as a rule: that whatever his mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction is to be held in suspicion, and that so much the more care is to be taken in dealing with such questions to keep the understanding even and clear."&lt;ref name=LVIII/&gt;

In [[computer programming]], an '''indentation style''' is a convention governing the [[Indentation (typesetting)|indentation]] of [[Block (programming)|blocks]] of code to convey program structure. This article largely addresses the [[free-form language]]s, such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and its descendants, but can be (and often is) applied to most other [[programming language]]s (especially those in the [[curly bracket programming language|curly bracket family]]), where [[Whitespace character|whitespace]] is otherwise insignificant. Indentation style is only one aspect of [[programming style]].

Indenting is not a requirement of most programming languages, where it is used as [[secondary notation]]. Rather, indenting helps better convey the structure of a program to human readers. Especially, it is used to clarify the link between [[control flow]] constructs such as conditions or loops, and code contained within and outside of them. However, some languages (such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[occam (programming language)|occam]]) use indenting to determine the structure instead of using braces or keywords; this is termed the [[off-side rule]]. In such languages, indenting is meaningful to the compiler or interpreter; it is more than only a clarity or style issue.

This article uses "[[bracket]]s" to refer to what are termed ''[[Bracket#Parentheses|parentheses]]'' in American English, and "braces" to refer to what are termed ''curly brackets'' in American English.

==Brace placement in compound statements==
The main difference between indentation styles lies in the placing of the braces of the compound statement (&lt;code&gt;{...}&lt;/code&gt;) that often follows a control statement (&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;...). The table below shows this placement for the style of statements discussed in this article; function declaration style is another case. The style for brace placement in statements may differ from the style for brace placement of a function definition. For consistency, the indentation depth has been kept constant at 4 spaces, regardless of the preferred indentation depth of each style.

==Tabs, spaces, and size of indentations==
Many early programs used [[Tab key|tab]] characters to indent, for simplicity and to save on source file size. [[Unix]] editors generally view tabs as equaling eight characters, while [[Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] environments would set them to four, creating confusion when code was transferred between environments. Modern programming editors can now often set arbitrary indentation sizes, and will insert the proper mix of tabs and spaces.

The issue of using hard tabs or spaces is an ongoing debate in the programming community. Some programmers such as [[Jamie Zawinski]] state that spaces instead of tabs increase [[cross-platform]] [[Porting|portability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jwz.org/doc/tabs-vs-spaces.html |title=Tabs versus Spaces: An Eternal Holy War |first=Jamie |last=Zawinski |year=2000 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the writers of the [[WordPress]] coding standards state the opposite, that hard tabs increase portability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards#Indentation |title=WordPress Coding Standards |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the indentation is usually independent of the style. In an experiment from 1983 performed on PASCAL code, a significant influence of indentation size on comprehensibility was found. The results indicate that indentation levels in the range from 2 to 4 characters ensure best comprehensibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miara |first1=Richard J. |last2=Musselman |first2=Joyce A. |last3=Navarro |first3=Juan A. |last4=Shneiderman |first4=Ben |last-author-amp=yes |date=November 1983 |title=Program Indentation and Comprehensibility |url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/papers/Miara1983Program.pdf |access-date=3 August 2017 |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=26 |number=11 |pages=861–867 |doi=10.1145/182.358437}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], many [[shell script]]ing languages, and some forms of [[HTML]] formatting, two spaces per indentation level is generally used.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Tools==
There are many computer programs that automatically correct indentation styles (according to the preferences of the program author) and the length of indents associated with tabs. A famous one is &lt;code&gt;[[indent (Unix)|indent]]&lt;/code&gt;, a program included with many [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s.

In [[Emacs]], various commands are available to automatically fix indenting problems, including hitting &lt;code&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt; on a given line (in the default configuration). &lt;code&gt;M-x indent-region&lt;/code&gt; can be used to properly indent large sections of code. Depending on the mode, Emacs can also replace leading indentation spaces with the proper number of tabs followed by spaces, which results in the minimal number of characters for indenting each source line.

[[Elastic tabstops]] is a tabulation style which requires support from the text editor, where entire blocks of text are kept automatically aligned when the length of one line in the block changes.

==Styles==
===K&amp;R style===
{{anchor|1TBS|OTBS}}
The K&amp;R style is commonly used in C, [[C++]], and other [[curly brace programming language]]s. It was the style used in the original Unix kernel, [[Brian Kernighan|Kernighan]] and [[Dennis Ritchie|Ritchie's]] book ''[[The C Programming Language]]'', as well as Kernighan and [[P. J. Plauger|Plauger]]'s book ''[[The Elements of Programming Style]]''.

When following K&amp;R, each function has its opening brace at the next line on the same indentation level as its header, the statements within the braces are indented, and the closing brace at the end is on the same indentation level as the header of the function at a line of its own.

{{anchor|Egyptian}} The blocks inside a function, however, have their opening braces at the same line as their respective control statements; closing braces remain in a line of their own, unless followed by a keyword &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;. Such non-[[typographic alignment|align]]ed braces are nicknamed "Egyptian braces" (or "Egyptian brackets") for their resemblance to arms in some fanciful poses of ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Java Style Guide |url=https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/current/java_style.shtml#f |quote=[https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/current/images/egyptian_braces.jpg Supposed ancient Egyptian pose]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Egyptian brackets |url=http://foldoc.org/Egyptian+brackets |website=[[Foldoc]] |quote=A humourous term for K&amp;R indent style, referring to the "one hand up in front, one down behind" pose}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google JavaScript Style Guide |url=https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#formatting-nonempty-blocks |quote=Braces follow the Kernighan and Ritchie style ("Egyptian brackets") for nonempty blocks and block-like constructs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    ...
    while (x == y) {
        something();
        somethingelse();

        if (some_error)
            do_correct();
        else
            continue_as_usual();
    }

    finalthing();
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

''[[The C Programming Language#Influence|The C Programming Language]]'' does not explicitly specify this style, though it is followed consistently throughout the book. From the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The position of braces is less important, although people hold passionate beliefs. We have chosen one of several popular styles. Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In old versions of the C language, argument types needed to be declared on the subsequent line (i.e., just after the header of the function):

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
/* Original pre-ISO C style without function prototypes */
int main(argc, argv)
    int   argc;
    char  *argv[];
{
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Variant: 1TBS (OTBS)====
Advocates of this style sometimes refer to it as "the one true brace style" (abbreviated as 1TBS or OTBS&lt;ref&gt;http://catb.org/jargon/html/0/one-TBS.html&lt;/ref&gt;). The main two differences from the K&amp;R style are that functions have their opening braces on the same line separated by a space, and that the braces are not omitted for a control statement with only a single statement in its scope&lt;ref name=onetruestyle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2ality.com/2013/01/brace-styles.html |title=Brace styles and JavaScript |date=7 January 2013 |access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In this style, the constructs that allow insertions of new code lines are on separate lines, and constructs that prohibit insertions are on one line. This principle is amplified by bracing every if, else, while, etc., including single-line conditionals, so that insertion of a new line of code anywhere is always safe (i.e., such an insertion will not make the flow of execution disagree with the source code indenting).

Suggested advantages of this style are that the starting brace needs no extra line alone; and the ending brace lines up with the statement it conceptually belongs to. One cost of this style is that the ending brace of a block needs a full line alone, which can be partly resolved in if/else blocks and do/while blocks: 

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
void checknegative(x) {
    if (x &lt; 0) {
        puts("Negative");
    } else {
        nonnegative(x);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

There are many mentions of The One True Brace Style out there, but there is some confusion as to its true form. Some sources say it is the variation specified above&lt;ref name=onetruestyle&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, while others note it as just another "hacker jargon" term for K&amp;R&lt;ref name=jargon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/I/indent-style.html |title=The Jargon File |version=4.4.7 |date=29 December 2003 |access-date=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Variant: Linux kernel====
A minor variant of the K&amp;R style is the linux kernel style, which is known for its extensive use in the source tree of the [[Linux kernel]]. [[Linus Torvalds]] strongly advises all contributors to follow it. A detailed description of the style (which considers indenting, and naming conventions, comments, and various other aspects) can be found at [https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html kernel.org]. The style borrows many elements from K&amp;R:

The kernel style uses tabs (with tab stops set at 8 characters) for indenting. Opening curly braces of a function go to the start of the line following the function header. Any other opening curly braces go on the same line as the corresponding statement, separated by a space. Labels in a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement are aligned with the enclosing block (there is only one level of indents). A single-statement body of a compound statement (such as if, while, and do-while) need not be surrounded by curly braces. If, however, one or more of the substatements in an &lt;code&gt;if-else&lt;/code&gt; statement require braces, then both substatements should be wrapped inside curly braces. Line length is limited to 80 characters.

The linux kernel style specifies that "if only one branch of a conditional statement is a single statement ... use braces in both branches":

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int power(int x, int y)
{
        int result;

        if (y &lt; 0) {
                result = 0;
        } else {
                result = 1;
                while (y-- &gt; 0)
                        result *= x;

        }
        return result;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Variant: mandatory braces====
Some advocate mandatory braces for control statements with only a single statement in its scope, ie., bracing every if, else, while, etc., including single-line conditionals, so that insertion of a new line of code anywhere is always ''safe'' (i.e., such an insertion will not make the flow of execution disagree with the source code indenting).

The cost of this style is that one extra full line is needed for the last block (except for intermedia blocks in if/else if/else constructs and do/while blocks).

==== Variant: Java ====
While [[Java (programming language)|Java]] is sometimes written in other styles, a significant body of Java code uses a minor variant of the [[#K&amp;R style|K&amp;R style]] in which the opening brace is on the same line not only for the blocks inside a function, but also for class or method declarations.
This style is widespread largely because [[Sun Microsystems]]'s original [[The C Programming Language|style guide]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/cc/products/archive/whitepapers/java-style.pdf |title=Java Coding Style Guide |last=Reddy |first=Achut |publisher=Sun Microsystems |date=30 March 2000 |access-date=30 May 2008 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228095122/http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/cc/products/archive/whitepapers/java-style.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/CodeConventions.pdf |title=Java Code Conventions |publisher=Sun Microsystems |date=12 September 1997 |access-date=30 May 2008 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513084244/http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/CodeConventions.pdf |archive-date=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title=Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language

| access-date=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; used this K&amp;R variant, and as a result most of the standard source code for the [[Java Class Library|Java API]] is written in this style. It is also a popular indentation style for [[ActionScript]] and [[JavaScript]], along with the [[#Allman style|Allman style]].

====Variant: Stroustrup====
Stroustrup style is [[Bjarne Stroustrup]]'s adaptation of K&amp;R style for C++, as used in his books, such as ''Programming: Principles and Practice using C++'' and ''[[The C++ Programming Language]]''.&lt;ref name="ppp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/PPP-style-rev3.pdf |title=PPP Style Guide |first=Bjarne |last=Stroustrup |date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the variants above, Stroustrup does not use a “cuddled else”. Thus, Stroustrup would write&lt;ref name="ppp" /&gt;

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
    if (x &lt; 0) {
        puts("Negative");
        negative(x);
    }
    else {
        puts("Non-negative");
        nonnegative(x);
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Stroustrup extends K&amp;R style for classes, writing them as follows:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
    class Vector {
    public:
        Vector(int s) :elem(new double[s]), sz(s) { }   // construct a Vector
        double&amp; operator[](int i) { return elem[i]; }   // element access: subscripting
        int size() { return sz; }
    private:
        double * elem;    // pointer to the elements
        int sz;           // number of elements
    };
&lt;/source&gt;

Stroustrup does not indent the labels {{code|public:}} and {{code|private:}}.  Also, in this style, while the opening brace of a ''function'' starts on a new line, the opening brace of a ''class'' is on the same line as the class name.

Stroustrup allows writing short functions all on one line.  Stroustrup style is a named indentation style available in the editor [[Emacs]]. Stroustrup encourages a K&amp;R-derived style layout with C++ as stated in his modern ''C++ Core Guidelines''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stroustrup |first1=Bjarne |title=C++ Core Guidelines |url=https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#nl17-use-kr-derived-layout |website=GitHub |access-date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Variant: BSD KNF====
Also termed [[Kernel Normal Form]], this is the form of most of the code used in the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) operating systems. Although mostly intended for kernel code, it is also widely used in [[userland (computing)|userland]] code. It is essentially a thoroughly-documented variant of K&amp;R style as used in the Bell Labs Version 6 &amp; 7 [[Unix]] source code.&lt;ref name="C Style and Coding Standards for SunOS"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shannon |first1=Bill |title=C Style and Coding Standards for SunOS |url=http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/06cse480/data/cstyle.ms.pdf |access-date=6 February 2015 |version=1.8 |publisher=Sun Microsystems, Inc. |date=19 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SunOS kernel and userland uses a similar indenting style.&lt;ref name="C Style and Coding Standards for SunOS" /&gt; Like KNF, this also was based on AT&amp;T style documents and that is sometimes termed Bill Joy Normal Form.&lt;ref name="DTraceToolkit Style Guide"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gregg |first1=Brendan |title=DTraceToolkit Style Guide |url=http://www.brendangregg.com/DTraceToolkit/style.html |access-date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SunOS guideline was published in 1996; ANSI C is discussed briefly. The correctness of the indenting of a list of source files can be verified by the ''cstyle'' program written by Bill Shannon.&lt;ref name="illumos-gate cstyle"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shannon |first1=Bill |title=cstyle.pl |version=1.58 |url=https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/blob/master/usr/src/tools/scripts/cstyle.pl |website=illumos-gate |publisher=Sun Microsystems, Inc. |date=9 September 1998 |access-date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2015}}

In this style, the hard tabulator (ts in [[vi]]) is kept at eight columns, while a soft tabulator is often defined as a helper also (sw in vi), and set at four.  The hard tabulators are used to indent code blocks, while a soft tabulator (four spaces) of additional indentation is used for all continuing lines that must be split over multiple lines.

Moreover, function calls do not use a space before the parenthesis, although C language native statements such as &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; do (in the case where &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is used with parens). Functions that declare no local variables in their top-level block should also leave an empty line after their opening block brace.

Here follow a few samples:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
while (x == y) {
        something();
        somethingelse();
}
finalthing();
&lt;/source&gt;

&amp;nbsp;
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
if (data != NULL &amp;&amp; res &gt; 0) {
        if (JS_DefineProperty(cx, o, "data",
            STRING_TO_JSVAL(JS_NewStringCopyN(cx, data, res)),
            NULL, NULL, JSPROP_ENUMERATE) != 0) {
                QUEUE_EXCEPTION("Internal error!");
                goto err;
        }
        PQfreemem(data);
} else {
        if (JS_DefineProperty(cx, o, "data", OBJECT_TO_JSVAL(NULL),
            NULL, NULL, JSPROP_ENUMERATE) != 0) {
                QUEUE_EXCEPTION("Internal error!");
                goto err;
        }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&amp;nbsp;
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
static JSBool
pgresult_constructor(JSContext *cx, JSObject *obj, uintN argc,
    jsval *argv, jsval *rval)
{

        QUEUE_EXCEPTION("PGresult class not user-instantiable");

        return (JS_FALSE);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Allman style===
{{anchor|Allman|Allman style|BSD/Allman style}}
The Allman style is named after [[Eric Allman]]. It is also sometimes termed ''BSD style'' since Allman wrote many of the utilities for [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] Unix (although this should not be confused with the different "BSD KNF style"; see above).

This style puts the brace associated with a control statement on the next line, indented to the same level as the control statement. Statements within the braces are indented to the next level.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
while (x == y)
{
    something();
    somethingelse();
}

finalthing();
&lt;/source&gt;

This style is similar to the standard indenting used by the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] languages and [[Transact-SQL]], where the braces are equivalent to the keywords &lt;code&gt;begin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
(* Example Allman code indenting style in Pascal *)
procedure dosomething(x, y: Integer);
begin
    while x = y do
    begin
        something();
        somethingelse();
    end;
end;
&lt;/source&gt;
Consequences of this style are that the indented code is clearly set apart from the containing statement by lines that are almost all [[Whitespace character|whitespace]] and the closing brace lines up in the same column as the opening brace. Some people feel this makes it easy to find matching braces. The blocking style also delineates the block of code from the associated control statement. Commenting out or removing a control statement or block of code, or [[code refactoring]], are all less likely to introduce syntax errors via dangling or missing braces. Also, it is consistent with brace placement for the outer-function block.

For example, the following is still correct syntactically:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
// while (x == y)
{
    something();
    somethingelse();
}
&lt;/source&gt;
As is this:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
// for (int i=0; i &lt; x; i++)
// while (x == y)
if (x == y)
{
    something();
    somethingelse();
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Even like this, with conditional compilation:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
    int c;
#ifdef HAS_GETCH
    while ((c = getch()) != EOF)
#else
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
#endif
    {
        do_something(c);
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

====Variant: Allman-8====
A popular variant for use in education,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Allman-8 uses the 8-space indentation tabs and 80-column limit of the Linux Kernel variant of K&amp;R. The style purportedly helps improve readability on projectors. Also, the indentation size and column restriction help create a visual cue for identifying excessive nesting of code blocks. These advantages combine to help provide newer developers and learners implicit guidance to manage code complexity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Whitesmiths style===
The Whitesmiths style, also sometimes termed Wishart style, was originally used in the documentation for the first commercial C compiler, the [[Whitesmiths]] Compiler. It was also popular in the early days of Windows, since it was used in three influential Windows programming books, ''[[Programmer's Guide to Windows]]'' by [[David Durant|Durant]], [[Geta Carlson|Carlson]] &amp; [[Paul Yao|Yao]], ''[[Programming Windows]]'' by [[Charles Petzold|Petzold]], and ''[[Windows 3.0 Power Programming Techniques]]'' by [[Peter Norton|Norton]] &amp; Yao.

Whitesmiths, along with [[#Allman style|Allman]], have been the most common bracing styles with equal popularity according to the [[Jargon File]].&lt;ref name=jargon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/I/indent-style.html |title=The Jargon File |version=4.4.7 |date=29 December 2003 |access-date=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This style puts the brace associated with a control statement on the next line, indented. Statements within the braces are indented to the same level as the braces.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
while (x == y)
    {
    something();
    somethingelse();
    }

finalthing();
&lt;/source&gt;

The advantages of this style are similar to those of the [[#Allman style|Allman style]]. Blocks are clearly set apart from control statements. The alignment of the braces with the block emphasizes that the full block is conceptually, and programmatically, one compound statement. Indenting the braces emphasizes that they are subordinate to the control statement. The ending brace no longer lines up with the statement, but instead with the opening brace.

An example:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
if (data != NULL &amp;&amp; res &gt; 0)
    {
    if (!JS_DefineProperty(cx, o, "data", STRING_TO_JSVAL(JS_NewStringCopyN(cx, data, res)), NULL, NULL, JSPROP_ENUMERATE))
        {
        QUEUE_EXCEPTION("Internal error!");
        goto err;
        }
    PQfreemem(data);
    }
else if (!JS_DefineProperty(cx, o, "data", OBJECT_TO_JSVAL(NULL), NULL, NULL, JSPROP_ENUMERATE))
    {
    QUEUE_EXCEPTION("Internal error!");
    goto err;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;else if&lt;/code&gt; are treated as statement, much like the &lt;code&gt;#elif&lt;/code&gt; preprocessor statement.

===GNU style===
{{Main article|GNU coding standards}}
Like the [[#Allman style|Allman]] and [[#Whitesmiths style|Whitesmiths]] styles, [[GNU]] style puts braces on a line by themselves, indented by two spaces, except when opening a function definition, where they are not indented.&lt;ref name="gnu.org"&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Formatting.html
|title=Formatting Your Source Code
|work=[[GNU Coding Standards]]
|access-date=6 June 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, the contained code is indented by two spaces from the braces.

Popularised by [[Richard Stallman]], the layout may be influenced by his background of writing [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] code.&lt;ref name="gnu.org-lisp"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.html |title=My Lisp Experiences and the Development of GNU Emacs (Transcript of speech at the International Lisp Conference) |first=Richard |last=Stallman |date=28 October 2002 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lisp, the equivalent to a block (a progn) is a first-class data entity, and giving it its own indentation level helps to emphasize that, whereas in C, a block is only syntax. This style can also be found in some [[ALGOL]] and [[XPL]] programming language textbooks from the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;R. Baumann, M. Feliciano, F. L. Bauer, and K. Samuelson, ''Introduction to Algol'', 1964, https://archive.org/details/introductiontoal00baum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. M. McKeeman, J. J. Horning, and D. B. Wortman, ''A Compiler Generator'', 1970, https://archive.org/details/compilergenerato00mcke&lt;/ref&gt;{{discuss|editorial option in lieu of source}} Although not directly related to indenting, GNU coding style also includes a space before the bracketed list of arguments to a function.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
static char *
concat (char *s1, char *s2)
{
  while (x == y)
    {
      something ();
      somethingelse ();
    }
  finalthing ();
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;ref name="gnu.org"/&gt;

This style combines the advantages of [[#Allman style|Allman]] and [[#Whitesmiths style|Whitesmiths]], thereby removing the possible Whitesmiths disadvantage of braces not standing out from the block. One disadvantage is that the ending brace no longer lines up with the statement it conceptually belongs to. Another possible disadvantage is that it might waste space by using two visual levels of indents for one conceptual level, but in reality this is unlikely because, in systems with single-level indenting, each level is usually at least 4 spaces, same as 2 * 2 spaces in GNU style.

The [[GNU Coding Standards]] recommend this style, and nearly all maintainers of [[GNU project]] software use it.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The [[GNU Emacs]] text editor and the GNU systems' [[indent (Unix)|indent]] command will reformat code according to this style by default.{{dubious|GNU emacs 23.3.1 mixes spaces and tabs; it does not always indent a block 'with two spaces'|date=December 2013}} Those who do not use GNU Emacs, or similarly extensible/customisable editors, may find that the automatic indenting settings of their editor are unhelpful for this style. However, many editors defaulting to KNF style cope well with the GNU style when the tab width is set to two spaces; likewise, GNU Emacs adapts well to KNF style by simply setting the tab width to eight spaces. In both cases, automatic reformatting destroys the original spacing, but automatic line indenting will work properly.

[[Steve McConnell]], in his book [[Code Complete]], advises against using this style: he marks a code sample which uses it with a "Coding Horror" icon, symbolizing especially dangerous code, and states that it impedes readability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Code Complete: A practical handbook of software construction |last=McConnell |first=Steve |publisher=Microsoft Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-7356-1967-0 |location=Redmond, WA |pages=746–747 |authorlink=Steve McConnell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Linux kernel]] coding style documentation also strongly recommends against this style, urging readers to burn a copy of the GNU coding standards as a "great symbolic gesture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Linux kernel coding style |url=https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst |access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horstmann style===
The 1997 edition of ''Computing Concepts with C++ Essentials'' by Cay S. Horstmann adapts [[#Allman style|Allman]] by placing the first statement of a block on the same line as the opening brace. This style is also used in examples in Jensen and Wirth's ''Pascal User Manual and Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kathleen |last1=Jensen |first2=Niklaus |last2=Wirth |title=PASCAL User Manual and Report |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
while (x == y)
{   something();
    somethingelse();
    //...
    if (x &lt; 0)
    {   printf("Negative");
        negative(x);
    }
    else
    {   printf("Non-negative");
        nonnegative(x);
    }
}
finalthing();
&lt;/source&gt;

This style combines the advantages of [[#Allman style|Allman]] by keeping the vertical alignment of the braces for readability, and identifying blocks easily, with the saving of a line of the K&amp;R style. However, the 2003 edition now uses Allman style throughout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horstmann.com/bigcpp/styleguide.html Horstmann Style Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pico style===
This is the style used most commonly in the language [[Pico (programming language)|Pico]] by its designers.  Pico lacks return statements, and uses semicolons as statement separators instead of terminators. It yields this syntax:

&lt;!--no geshi support for pico--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
stuff(n):
{ x: 3 * n;
  y: doStuff(x);
  y + x }
&lt;/pre&gt;

The advantages and disadvantages are similar to those of saving screen real estate with K&amp;R style.  An added advantage is that the starting and closing braces are consistent in application (both share space with a line of code), relative to K&amp;R style, where one brace shares space with a line of code and one brace has a line alone.

===Ratliff style===
In the book ''Programmers at Work'',&lt;ref name=lammers&gt;{{cite book |last=Lammers |first=Susan |title=Programmers at Work |year=1986 |publisher=Microsoft Press |isbn=0-914845-71-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; C. Wayne Ratliff discussed using the style below. The style begins much like 1TBS but then the closing brace lines up with the indentation of the nested block. Ratliff was the original programmer behind the popular [[dBase]]-II and -III [[fourth-generation programming language]]s. He indicated that it was originally documented in material from [[Digital Research]] Inc. This style has sometimes been termed ''banner'' style,&lt;ref name=pattee&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pattee |first1=Jim |title=Artistic Style 2.05 Documentation |url=http://astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle.html |website=Artistic Style |access-date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly for the resemblance to a banner hanging from a pole. In this style, which is to [[#Whitesmiths style|Whitesmiths]] as K&amp;R is to Allman, the closing control is indented as the last item in the list (and thus properly loses salience). The style can make visual scanning easier for some, since the ''headers'' of any block are the only thing exdented at that level (the theory being that the closing control of the prior block interferes with the visual flow of the next block header in the K&amp;R and Allman styles). Kernighan and Plauger use this style in the Ratfor code in ''Software Tools''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Brian W. |last1=Kernighan |first2=P. J. |last2=Plauger |title=Software Tools |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 // In C
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
     if (i % 2 == 0) {
         doSomething(i);
         }
     else {
         doSomethingElse(i);
         }
     }
&lt;/source&gt;

or, in a markup language...

&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; lots of stuff...
      more stuff
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; alternative for short lines &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; etc. &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt; ... etc
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Lisp style===
A programmer may even go as far as to insert closing braces in the last line of a block. This style makes indenting the only way to distinguish blocks of code, but has the advantage of containing no uninformative lines. This could easily be called the Lisp style (because this style is very common in Lisp code) or the Python style (Python has no braces, but the layout is very similar, as shown in the code blocks below). In Python, layout is a part of the language, called the [[off-side rule]].

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
// In C
for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
    {if (i % 2 == 0)
        {doSomething(i);}
    else
        {doSomethingElse(i);
        doThirdThing(i);}}
&lt;/source&gt;

&amp;nbsp;
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
# In Python
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        do_something(i)
    else:
        do_something_else(i)
        do_third_thing(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

&amp;nbsp;
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
;; In Lisp
(dotimes (i 10)
    (if (= (rem i 2) 0)
        (do-something i)
        (progn
            (do-something-else i)
            (do-third-thing i))))
&lt;/source&gt;

===Haskell style===
[[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] layout can make the placement of braces optional, although braces and semicolons are allowed in the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/lexemes.html |title=The Haskell 98 Report |access-date=3 March 2016 |website=haskell.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two segments below are equally acceptable to the compiler:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
braceless = do
  text &lt;- getContents
  let
    firstWord = head $ words text
    bigWord = map toUpper firstWord
  putStrLn bigWord

braceful = do
  { text &lt;- getContents
  ; let
      { firstWord = head $ words text
      ; bigWord = map toUpper firstWord
      }
  ; putStrLn bigWord
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
In Haskell, indentation is significant, and layout can replace braces.
Usually the braces and semicolons are omitted for [[Procedural programming|procedural]] &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; sections and the program text in general, but the style is commonly used for lists, records and other syntactic elements made up of some pair of parentheses or braces, which are separated with commas or semicolons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses |title=Making Our Own Types and Typeclasses |access-date=3 February 2016 |website=learnyouahaskell.com |last=Lipovača |first=Miran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==
===Losing track of blocks===
In some situations, there is a risk of losing track of block boundaries. This is often seen in large sections of code containing many compound statements nested to many levels of indentations. By the time the programmer scrolls to the bottom of a huge set of nested statements, he or she may have lost track of which control statements go where.  However, overly-long code could have other causes, such as being too [[Cyclomatic complexity|complex]], and a programmer facing this problem might instead consider whether [[code refactoring]] would help in the longer term.

Programmers who rely on counting the opening braces may have difficulty with indentation styles such as K&amp;R, where the starting brace is not visually separated from its [[Control flow|control statement]]. Programmers who rely more on indentations will gain more from styles that are vertically compact, such as K&amp;R, because the blocks are shorter.

To avoid losing track of control statements such as &lt;code&gt;[[for loop|for]]&lt;/code&gt;, a large indentation can be used, such as an 8-unit-wide hard tab, along with breaking up large functions into smaller and more readable functions. Linux is done this way, while using the K&amp;R style.

In text editors of the [[vi]] family, one means to track block boundaries is to position the text cursor over one of the braces, and press the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; key. The cursor then jumps to the opposing brace. Since the text cursor's &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; key (viz., the &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; key) retained directional positioning information (whether the &lt;code&gt;up&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;down&lt;/code&gt; key was formerly pressed), the [[Macro (computer science)#Keyboard and mouse macros|dot macro]] (the &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; key) could then be used to place the text cursor on the next brace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Linda |last=Lamb |title=Learning the vi editor |publisher=O'Reilly}}&lt;/ref&gt; given a suitable coding style. Instead, inspecting the block boundaries using the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; key can be used to enforce a coding standard.

Another way is to use inline comments added after the closing brace:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; total; i++) {
    foo(bar);
} //for (i)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
if (x &lt; 0) {
   bar(foo);
} //if (x &lt; 0)
&lt;/source&gt;

The major disadvantage of this method is maintaining duplicate code in multiple locations.

Another solution is implemented in a [[folding editor]], which can hide or reveal blocks of code via their indentation level or compound-statement structure. Many editors will also highlight matching brackets or braces when the [[Cursor (user interface)|cursor]] is positioned next to one.

===Statement insertion===
K&amp;R style prevents another common error suffered when using the standard [[Unix]] line editor, [[Ed (text editor)|ed]]. A statement mistakenly inserted between the control statement and the opening brace of the loop block turns the body of the loop into a single trip.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
    whoops(bar);   /* repeated 10 times, with i from 0 to 9 */
{
    only_once();   /* Programmer intended this to be done 10 times */
} //for (i) &lt;-- This comment is no longer valid, and is very misleading!
&lt;/source&gt;

K&amp;R style avoids this problem by keeping the control statement and the opening brace on the same line.

'''ICOFOM''', the '''International Committee for Museology''' of the [[International Council of Museums|International Council of Museums (ICOM)]] was founded in 1977 at the initiative of Jan Jelínek, in order to promote research and theoretical thinking within the museum world. This committee became one of the most popular in [[International Council of Museums|International Council of Museums (ICOM)]]. It addresses the study of the theoretical foundation that guides museum activities around the world or, more generally, the analysis of the different forms that museums can have.  The committee includes several hundred museologists from all over the world, organizes yearly symposia and publishes, among other monographs, the annual journal ''ICOFOM Study Series'', available online.

== Origins ==

The work of the [[International Council of Museums|International Council of Museums (ICOM)]], begun in 1946, was based on much older programmes, specifically professional symposia, journals of national associations (''Museums Journal'', Great Britain, 1902; ''Museumskunde'', Germany, 1905), and of course the work of the International Office of Museums, founded in 1926 by the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, located in Paris. A large part of the research which grew out of these associations, as with international committees, focused on objectives relating to concrete professional concerns. In 1968 [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]] launched an international committee for the training of museum professionals (ICTOP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000795/079510eo.pdf#page=11 P. J. Boylan, "Museum training: a central concern of ICOM for forty years”. ''Museum'', no. 156, 1987,  pp. 225–230.]&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when museum training courses were gaining popularity, in particular in [[Brno]], Czechoslovakia (1963), [[Leicester]], UK (1966) and Paris (1970). On the other hand, the development of specific theories linked to the museum phenomenon – long referred to as "museography", which became "[[museology]]" after WWII – was not a research interest for most museum professionals. Nevertheless, this field was particularly interesting for some researchers and university professors, in particular in Eastern European countries, first of all Jan Jelínek who was director of the Antropos Museum in [[Brno]] and president of [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]]. The International Committee for Museology was founded in 1977 at the General Conference of [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]] in Moscow. Its first president was Jan Jelínek (Vinoš Sofka succeeded him in 1981&lt;ref&gt;[http://network.icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/minisites/icofom/pdf/ISS%20HISTORY%201995%20V.%20SOFKA.pdf V. Sofka. ''My adventurous life with ICOFOM, museology, museologists and anti-museologists, giving special reference to ICOFOM Study Series'', 1995, 32 p.]&lt;/ref&gt;). Since that date we can say that three generations of museologists have continued to pursue the work of ICOFOM.

== Three generations of museologists ==

[[Museology]] was already developed in Eastern Europe at the time of the cold war. From the start ICOFOM would be a unique international platform that included researchers from both sides of the Iron Curtain, who were trying to set up museology as an autonomous discipline: without this independent status museology could not be taught in universities in Eastern countries, making this task a challenge of singular importance in the countries of the [[Warsaw Pact]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Šola, "What is museology?", ''Papers in Museology, 1'', Stockholm, Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International, 1992, pp. 10–19.&lt;/ref&gt; The iconic personalities of museology, such as [[Georges Henri Rivière]], and especially [[André Desvallées]] in France, worked at the same time as influential museologists in the Eastern bloc, among whom are [[Avram Moiseevich Razgon|
Avram Razgon]] ([[USSR|URSS]]), [[Klaus Schreiner]] ([[East Germany|DDR]]), [[Jiří Neustupný]] ([[Czechoslovakia]]), [[Josef Beneš]] ([[Czechoslovakia]]), [[Wojciech Gluzinski]] ([[Poland]]), and especially [[Zbyněk Stránský]] ([[Czechoslovakia]]).&lt;ref&gt;F. Mairesse, ''Le musée, temple spectaculaire'', Lyon, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The stated aim of ICOFOM, under the dynamic leadership of [[Vinoš Sofka]] ([[Sweden]]), was to make an inventory of the different trends in museology throughout the world, and to develop this discipline in order to endow it with the status of science within the academic structure. At the beginning this essentially theoretical approach disconcerted many museum researchers who were much more pragmatic, for example [[George Ellis Burcaw]], author of an influential manual on museum work in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://network.icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/minisites/icofom/pdf/MuWoP%202%20(1981)%20Eng.pdf#page=87 G. E. Burcaw, "Reflexions on MuWop no 1", ''MuWop/Do Tram'', no. 2, 1981, pp. 83–84]; G. E.  Burcaw, ''Introduction to Museum Work'', Nashville, American Association for State and Local History, 1983 (2nd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the climate of the cold war, which was still going on, did not help in creating closer links between the two sides. On the other hand, many researchers from Latin countries, in particular [[Waldisia Russio]]&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Oleveira Bruno, ''Waldisa Rússio Camargo Guarnieri Textos e contextos de uma trajetória profissional'', Sāo Paulo, ICOM/Pinacoteca, 2010, 2 vols.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Brazil]]), are especially attracted to this approach.

Much enlarged new definitions of museology emerged, whose object of study reaches beyond the museum itself. The museum institution per se, the concept of museum as opposed to the specific museum, such as the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]],is relatively recent, and what interests museologists is a specific attitude which led to the creation of museums, as well as cabinets of curiosity, or in the future new forms linked to digital technologies ([[Virtual museum]]s): As already defined by the Czech museologist [[Anna Gregorová]] in 1980 "Museology is a science studying the specific relation of man to reality, consisting in purposeful and systematic collecting and conservation of selected inanimate material, mobile, and mainly three-dimensional objects documenting the development of nature and society" and "the museum is an institution which applies and carries out the specific relation of man to reality".&lt;ref&gt;[http://network.icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/minisites/icofom/pdf/MuWoP%201%20(1980)%20Eng.pdf#page=21 A. Grégorová,  “Museology, science or just practical museum work?”, ''MuWoP / DoTraM'', no 1, 1980, pp. 20–21.]&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, which allowed for better describing the particular activity of selecting and describing an object in a museum – a phenomenon not too far from a sacred act –  more specific concepts were developed, such as musealisation, a term used more in French and Spanish than in English, (the act of introducing an object into a museum context), and museality (the special value of the object which determines its musealisation).&lt;ref&gt;A. Desvallées, and F. Mairesse (Eds), ''Dictionnaire encyclopédique de muséologie'', Paris, Armand Colin, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zbyněk Stránský]], the Czech museologist, was of major importance in this development, through his involvement in ICOFOM and also through the International Summer School of Museology, which he founded in Brno in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Z. Stranský, ''Museology: Introduction to Studies'', Brno, Masaryk University, 1995; Zbynek Z. Stranský, "Ten years of the International Summer School of Museology", in Zbynek Z. Stranský (Ed.), ''Museology for Tomorrow’s World'', Munich, Verlag Müller-Straten (ISSOM Publications), 1997, pp. 143–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this first generation of ICOFOM researchers, under the eight year presidency of [[Vinoš Sofka]], came a second, more diverse group of researchers. A leading member of this generation was Peter van Mensch (Netherlands), author of a 1992 doctoral thesis on museology as a scientific discipline: Towards a Methodology of Museology, who followed Sofka as President of ICOFOM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muuseum.ee/et/erialane_areng/museoloogiaalane_ki/ingliskeelne_kirjand/p_van_mensch_towar/ P. van Mensch, ''Towards a Methodology of Museology'', University of Zagreb, Faculty of Philosophy, Doctor’s Thesis, 1992.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other outstanding museologists in this generation were [[Ivo Maroévić]] ([[Croatia]]), [[Bernard Deloche]] and [[Mathilde Bellaigue]] (France), [[Martin Schaerer]] ([[Switzerland]]), as well as [[Teresa Scheiner]] ([[Brazil]]), [[Tomislav Šola]] ([[Croatia]]) and [[Nelly Decarolis]] ([[Argentina]]). [[Alpha Oumar Konaré]], ([[Mali]]), who was particularly attentive to the development of new museology, had a remarkable career: he was elected President of [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]] in 1989, but did not renew his mandate when he became President of [[Mali]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000859/085994eo.pdf#page=63 A. O. Konaré "An exclusive ''Museum'' interview with Alpha Oumar Konaré, the new President of ICOM”, ''Museum'', no. 165, 1990, pp. 61–62.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Broader definitions of the museum phenomenon began at this time, in particular one by Judith Spielbauer: “The established museum is a means to an end, not the end itself. These ends have been stated in many ways. They include varying perspectives on broadening an individual’s perception of the interdependence of the social, aesthetic and natural worlds in which he lives by providing information and experience and fostering an understanding of self within this widening context. The increase and dissemination of knowledge, the improvement of the quality of life, and preservation for future generations are all included in the usual parades of rationales.”&lt;ref&gt;Judith Spielbauer, 'Museums and Museology: a Means to Active Integrative Preservation', ''ICOFOM Study Series'', no. 12, 1987, pp. 271–277.&lt;/ref&gt; Other thinkers, such as Jennifer Harris and Kerstin Smeds, further expanded the definitions and added provocative nuances.

A third generation, schooled in museology by the second one, gradually joined the work of researchers: in particular one can note Wanchen Chang ([[Taiwan]]) and Bruno Brulon Soares ([[Brazil]]). They all share a global vision of museology founded on critical thinking about the development of museums in the world and on the values that form the conditions for museum work. For the past thirty years the museum has undergone considerable changes, whether becoming more market oriented which has been the case in many countries, museums' relationship to collections, which is endlessly altered, and of course digital technologies whose development has transformed our way of seeing the world. In the light of this evolution of the museum world, it is important to understand and to prepare for the possible evolution of the museum itself.

== Museology today and the work of ICOFOM ==

Today museology – as seen by ICOFOM – can be defined as "comprising all the efforts at theorization
and critical thinking about the museum field".&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Key_Concepts_of_Museology/Museologie_Anglais_BD.pdf A. Desvallées, and François Mairesse (Eds), ''Key Concepts of Museology'', Paris, Armand Colin &amp; ICOM, 2010, p. 56.]&lt;/ref&gt; This vision, intentionally very broad, collects trends of thought that are often conflicting as they are linked to critical thinkers in different parts of the world, whether [[Benjamin Ives Gilman]] or [[Georges Brown Goode]], [[John Cotton Dana]] or Joseph Veach Noble, and, more currently, Duncan F. Cameron, Neil Postman, [[Georges Henri Rivière]], [[Zbyněk Stránský]], [[André Desvallées]], [[Stephen Weil]] or [[Roland Arpin]]. ICOFOM is harnessed to this work of research and synthesis, and strives to compile an inventory of the different ways to conceive of museums and museology and to generate, through these syntheses, the trends that emerge from the vast flux of change in the museum field. Within ICOFOM most working researchers teach at universities after having spent part of their career in a museum (or while continuing museum work at the same time). Presently there are about 700 members in the committee, of whom about 60% are from European countries and more than 20% live in Latin America.

ICOFOM is known for its expansion into parts of the world where museums are rapidly developing. In this regard, [[Nelly Decarolis]] and [[Tereza Scheiner]] started and sustained a subcommittee, ICOFOM LAM, or ICOFOM Latin America. The great success of this subcommittee prompted the formation of ICOFOM ASPAC, ICOFOM Asia and the South Pacific, under the strong leadership of Olga Truevtseva and [[Hildegard Vieregg]]. Regional subcommittees such as these provide important support and training for those interested in the work of ICOFOM but who cannot always get to annual meetings. in distant parts of the world.

Right from the start publications were a major part of ICOFOM activities. The first issues of ''Museological Working Papers'', published in 1980 and 1981, were followed by ''ICOFOM Study Series'' (ISS) published annually, which comprise in all several thousand pages and are available on line at the ICOFOM site. In general, ISS publishes papers presented at the ICOFOM symposiums. In 2007, the ICOFOM editorial committee installed a double-blind peer review of papers submitted for publication.

ICOFOM has also published syntheses of museology: ''What is a museum?'',&lt;ref&gt;A. Davis, F. Mairesse, and André Desvallées, ''What is a Museum?'' Munich, Verlag Müller-Straten, 2011.

The '''John Ward House''' is a [[National Historic Landmark]] at 132 Essex Street in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], United States. With an early construction history between 1684 and 1723, it is an excellent example of [[First Period]] architecture, and as the subject of an early 20th-century restoration by antiquarian [[George Francis Dow]], it is an important example of the restoration techniques.  Now owned by the [[Peabody Essex Museum]], it is also one of the first colonial-era houses in the United States to be opened as a museum.  It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=799&amp;ResourceType=Building John Ward House NHL listing info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002123627/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=799&amp;ResourceType=Building |date=2012-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essexheritage.org/attractions/john-ward-house] John Ward House, 1684&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Ward House was built in three distinct phases.  John Ward, a [[currier]] by profession, built the first portion of the house in 1684.  This consisted of a two-story structure with one room on each floor, and a large chimney at one end.  This portion was extended by Ward to the right-side of the chimney, giving the house a typical colonial five-bay facade, with center entry and chimney.  The last addition to the house was the [[lean-to]] at the rear, which gave the house a [[saltbox]] appearance, and was apparently added not long before Ward's death in 1734.  By this time he was apparently sharing the house with his son Benjamin, who inherited the property.  The house remained in the hands of the Ward family until 1816, when it was sold at auction as part of an estate.&lt;ref name=NHL&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=68000045}}|title=NHL nomination for John Ward House|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buyer at auction was Temple Hardy, who lived in the house for forty years, and operated a bakery on the premises.  The house was then converted to a multi-unit residential tenement, which it remained until 1910.  At some point in the 19th century a wing was added to the east end of the building; this was removed before 1905. Originally located on Prison Lane (now St. Peter Street), the house was moved to its present site in 1910 by splitting it into two and rolling it on ox-drawn logs from its original site three blocks away.  In 1912 the house underwent a careful restoration under the direction of antiquarian [[George Francis Dow]].  Dow's work included decorating the space to meet his conception of the use of the house c. 1700.

In 1911, parts of the house were opened to the public, becoming the first outdoor museum of architecture in the country.  The Peabody Essex Museum now offers guided tours of the house.  Rooms on the first floor feature 17th-century furnishings and displays in the lean-to on retail premises of the period.&lt;ref name=NHL/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:1820 Salem Massachusetts map bySaunders BPL 12094.png|thumb|Salem - 1820]]
The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a large central chimney and a side-gable roof.  The roof of the main facade has two large cross gable sections, each with a single window; these gables were removed at some time in the history of the house, and rebuilt at the time of its restoration. The windows on the first two floors of the main facade are doubled casement windows with diamond panes (all of the house's windows are diamond-paned), except that above the doorway, which is a single window.  The exterior is finished in clapboards, with very simple cornerboards and trim.  The second floor extends over the first floor by a modest amount.&lt;ref name=NHL/&gt;

The first floor interior is a somewhat typical center-chimney plan, with chambers on either side, and a narrow stairway rising to the second floor directly inside the front door.  Both the front door and the staircase are restored elements.  The room left of the chimney is the parlor, and is finished in pine.  Traces of whitewash and paint are evident on the main beams, and the summer beam and posts are chamfered.  The floor and some of its joists are partly original, and partly the work of the 1912 restorers.  The only major structural member to have restorative work done was a post supporting the chimney girt.  The right-side room, considered the kitchen, exhibits similar restorative work.&lt;ref name=NHL/&gt;

On the second floor, the left chamber is the finer of the two, but is framed in oak instead of pine.  The right-side chamber was left unrestored by the 1912 work, and exhibits faded wallpaper and a plastered ceiling, much as it would have at that time.  The roof, although many of its framing elements are numbered in a traditional way, shows evidence of having been extensively reworked during the restoration.&lt;ref name=NHL/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9722">The '''Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art''', operated by the Leslie-Lohman Gay Art Foundation, is a visual [[art museum]] in [[SoHo]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It mainly collects, preserves and exhibits [[visual arts]] created by [[LGBTQ]] artists or art about LGBTQ themes, issues, and people.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, "Arts and Education," in ''The [[Harvey Milk Institute]] Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Internet Research,'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum offers exhibitions year-round in numerous locations and owns more than 22,000 objects, including, paintings, drawings, photography, prints and sculpture. It has been recognized as one of the oldest arts groups engaged in the collection and preservation of gay art.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, "Gay Pride (and Anguish) Around the Galleries," ''New York Times,'' June 24, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, the Foundation was awarded Museum status by the New York State Board of Regents.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/read/the-leslie-lohman-museum-of-gay-and-lesbian-art&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum is a member of the [[American Alliance of Museums]] and operates pursuant to their guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leslielohman.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum maintains a Permanent Collection into which more than 1,300 objects have been accessioned.  The Permanent Collection contains works by a number of well-known gay artists such as [[Berenice Abbott]], [[David Hockney]], [[Ingo Swann]], [[Catherine Opie]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Tom of Finland]], [[Delmas Howe]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[David Wojnarowicz]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[George Platt Lynes]], [[Horst P. Horst|Horst]], [[Duncan Grant]], [[James Bidgood (filmmaker)|James Bidgood]], [[Duane Michals]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[Don Bachardy]], [[Attila Richard Lukacs]], [[Jim French (photographer)|Jim French]], [[Del LaGrace Volcano]], [[Paul Thek]], [[Peter Hujar]], [[Arthur Tress]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wmagazine.com/culture/not-a-fashion-photo/2014/08/gay-and-lesbian-art/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/arts/design/permanency-displays-gay-and-lesbian-art.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Genre"&gt;Sanchez, "Leslie-Lohman Gallery: The Ultimate Gay Portfolio," ''Genre Magazine,'' September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
To exhibit and preserve art that speaks directly to the many aspects of the LGBTQ experience, and foster the artists who create it. We embrace the rich creative history of this community by educating, informing, inspiring, entertaining, and challenging all who enter our doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.leslielohman.org/about.html|title= Leslie Lohman Missions Statement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Leslie-Lohman Gay Art Foundation was founded by J. Frederic "Fritz" Lohman and Charles W. Leslie.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Robinson, "Future Events From Art to Zippers," ''The New York Times,'' April 25, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The two men had been collecting art for several years, and mounted their first exhibition of gay art in their loft on Prince Street in New York City in 1969. They opened a commercial [[art museum|art gallery]] shortly thereafter, but this venue closed in the early 1980s at the advent of the [[AIDS]] [[pandemic]].&lt;ref name="Genre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeStefano"&gt;De Stefano, "Artistic Outlaws: Leslie and Lohman Have Fought to Preserve Gay Art for Three Decades," ''New York Blade,'' March 20, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the two men applied for nonprofit status as a precursor to establishing a foundation to preserve their collection of gay art and continue exhibition efforts. The [[Internal Revenue Service]] objected to the word "gay" in the title of the foundation and held up the nonprofit application for several years. The Foundation was granted nonprofit status in 1990.&lt;ref name="DeStefano" /&gt;

The Leslie-Lohman Gay Art Foundation's first location was in a basement at 127B Prince Street in New York City.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeStefano" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, "The Week Ahead: Jan. 22 - Jan. 28," ''The New York Times,'' January 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Foundation moved into a ground floor gallery at 26 Wooster Street in historic SoHo; gallery space will be expanding in size in 2016-2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://artforum.com/news/id=54894&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The Museum offers several principle programs, including the maintenance of its Permanent and Study Collections, 6-8 annual exhibitions at 26 Wooster Street, 4-6 annual exhibitions in the Wooster Street Windows Gallery, and multiple weekend exhibitions and drawing workshops at its Prince Street Project Space at 127b Prince Street in [[SoHo]]. The Museum's exhibitions are organized by Guest Curators who submit proposals which are reviewed by the Museum Director and Exhibition Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.leslielohman.org/get-involved/Guidelines_for_Proposing_an%20Exhibition_to_Leslie-Lohman%20Museum_of_Gay_and_Lesbian_Art.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726041157/https://www.leslielohman.org/get-involved/Guidelines_for_Proposing_an%20Exhibition_to_Leslie-Lohman%20Museum_of_Gay_and_Lesbian_Art.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Museum offers a complete year-round schedule of educational programing, including talks, lectures ([[Slava Mogutin]], [[Duane Michals]], [[Catherine Opie]], [[Jonathan David Katz]], etc.), films and books signings.&lt;ref name="Genre" /&gt; The LLGAF also publishes [https://web.archive.org/web/20101226071007/http://www.leslielohman.org/MainPgs/Journal1.html ''The Archive''] made available to its membership that includes information on the Leslie-Lohman collection, new acquisitions, events, and articles on artists and exhibitions. The Museum has a library with more than 2,500 volumes on gay art and maintains files on more than 2,000 individual artists. The Museum has begun to travel its exhibitions as its 2013 ''[[Sascha Schneider]]'' exhibition traveled to the [[Schwules Museum]] in Berlin. The Museum's ''Classical Nude: The Making of Queer History'' was on preview at the [[ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives]] gallery in West Hollywood in the summer of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://one.usc.edu/the-classical-nude/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum makes objects in its collection available for loan to qualified organizations and in recent years has borrowed works from other institutions, including the [[Library of Congress]], [[Smithsonian Institution]]. [[New York Public Library]], [[The Andy Warhol Museum]], and other organizations.

==Governance and Finances==
The Leslie-Lohman Museum is governed by an independent Board of Directors. The Foundation employs a full-time staff, and relies on the assistance of volunteers to implement its programs.&lt;ref name="Genre" /&gt; The Museum also runs a Fellowship Program.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leslielohman.org/get-involved/participate.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is financed by its endowment, contributions from private donors and foundations as well as a membership program. The Foundation expands its collection primarily by donations from artists and collectors. It files an IRS 990 tax return each year.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1404">The '''Manx Society for the Publication of National Documents''', or simply the '''Manx Society''', was a [[text publication society]] founded in February 1858 with the objective of publishing reprints of historical documents relating to the [[Isle of Man]], its people, and culture. Over its lifetime the society published 33 volumes of documents, the last appearing in 1893. Its publications included an English-[[Manx language|Manx]] dictionary based on the surviving manuscript of [[John Kelly (scholar)|John Kelly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|title=Kelly, John (1750-1809|first=Arthur William|last= Moore | authorlink=Arthur William Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; books on the laws and currency of the island, reprints of accounts of visits to the island, the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' in Manx, and a translation of the ''[[Chronicles of Mann]]''.

'''''Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference''''' is a reference book published by [[Pharmaceutical Press]] listing some 6,000 [[drug]]s and [[medicines]] used throughout the world, including details of over 180,000 proprietary preparations. It also includes almost 700 disease treatment reviews. It was first published in 1883 under the title '''''Martindale: The Extra Pharmacopoeia'''''.
''Martindale'' contains information on drugs in clinical use worldwide, as well as selected investigational and veterinary drugs, [[herbal]] and complementary medicines, pharmaceutical excipients, [[vitamins]] and nutritional agents, [[vaccine]]s, radiopharmaceuticals, [[contrast media]] and [[diagnostic agent]]s, medicinal gases, [[drugs of abuse]] and [[recreational drug]]s, toxic substances, [[disinfectant]]s, and [[pesticide]]s.

==International usefulness==
''Martindale'' aims to cover drugs and related substances reported to be of clinical interest anywhere in the world.
It provides a useful source of information for patients arriving from abroad to identify their existing medication. This may reveal that a currently taken proprietary preparation is available under another brand name. Alternatively if the drug is not available, the class of agent can be determined allowing a [[pharmacist]] or doctor to determine which alternative equivalent drugs can be substituted. Monographs include [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] (CAS), [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System]] (ATC) numbers and FDA [[Unique Ingredient Identifier]] (UNII) codes to help readers refer to other information systems.

==Arrangement==
''Martindale'' is arranged into two main parts followed by three extensive indexes:
* '''[[Monograph]]s on drugs and ancillary substances''', listing over 6,000 monographs arranged in 49 chapters based on clinical use with the corresponding disease treatment reviews. Monographs summarize the nomenclature, properties, and actions of each substance. A chapter on supplementary drugs and other substances covers some 1190 monographs on new drugs, those not easily classified, herbals, and drugs no longer clinically used but still of interest. Monographs of some toxic substances are also included.
* '''Preparations''' - including over 180,000 items from 43 countries and regions, including China.
* '''Directory of Manufacturers''' listing some 20,000 entries.
* '''Pharmaceutical Terms in Various Languages''': this index lists nearly 5,600 pharmaceutical terms and routes of administration in 13 major European languages as an aid to the non-native speaker in interpreting packaging, product information, or prescriptions written in another language.
* '''General index''': prepared from 175,000 entries it includes approved names, synonyms and chemical names; a separate Cyrillic section lists nonproprietary and proprietary names in Russian and Ukrainian.
Digital versions include an additional 1,000 drug monographs, 60,000 preparation names, and 5,000 manufacturers.

== List of the editions ==
To date there have been 39 editions of ''Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference''.  The 39th edition was published in June 2017.

[[Image:Paulo Orosio - Detalle.jpg|thumb|250px|Paulus Orosius, shown in a miniature from the Saint-Epure codex.]]

'''Paulus Orosius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɔː|l|ə|s|_|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ|ʒ|ə|s}}; born {{circa}} 375, died after 418 AD)&lt;ref&gt;David Rohrbacher, "Orosius," in ''The Historians of Late Antiquity'' (Routledge, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TLvK-_fk8TkC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=Orosius+life+OR+biography+OR+born+OR+birth&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U2atlXMBUN45DliVbnt_fLlckZInw pp. 135–137.] Rohrbacher bases the date of birth on Augustine's description of Orosius as a "young priest" and a "son by age" in the period 414–418, which would place his age at 30 or younger. Rohrbacher further speculates (p. 137) that Orosius may have died in a shipwreck while attempting to return to ''Hispania'' after visiting Palestine and Africa, since nothing is heard of him after 418, which is also the likely date of completion of his last book.&lt;/ref&gt; — less often '''Paul Orosius''' in English — was a [[Gallaeci]]an [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] priest, [[historian]] and [[theology|theologian]], a student of [[Augustine of Hippo]]. It is possible that he was born in ''[[Bracara Augusta]]'' (now [[Braga]], [[Portugal]]), then capital of the Roman province of [[Gallaecia]], and which would be the capital of the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] by his death.&lt;ref name="cavero22"/&gt;  Although there are some questions regarding his biography, such as his exact date of birth, it is known that he was a person of some prestige from a cultural point of view, as he had contact with the greatest figures of his time such as Saint Augustine of Hippo and Saint [[Jerome]]. In order to meet with them Orosius travelled to cities on the southern coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], such as [[Hippo Regius]] and [[Alexandria]].

These journeys defined his life and intellectual output. Orosius did not just discuss theological matters with Saint Augustine; he also collaborated with him on the book ''[[The City of God (book)|City of God]]''.&lt;ref name="caver35"/&gt; In addition, in 415 he was chosen to travel to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in order to exchange information with other intellectuals. He was also able to participate in a Church Council meeting in [[Jerusalem]] on the same trip and he was entrusted with transporting the [[relic]]s of [[Saint Stephen]]. The date of his death is also unclear, although it appears to have not been earlier than 418, when he finished one of his books, or later than 423.&lt;ref name="cavero57"/&gt;

He wrote a total of three books, of which his most important is his ''Seven Books of History Against the Pagans'' ({{lang-la|Historiarum Adversum Paganos Libri VII}}), considered to be one of the books with the greatest impact on [[historiography]] during the period between [[Ancient history|antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], as well as being one of the most important Hispanic books of all time. Part of its importance comes from the fact that the author shows his historiographical methodology. The book is a historical narration focusing on the pagan peoples from the earliest time up until the time Orosius was alive.&lt;ref name="rabade377"/&gt;

Orosius was a highly influential figure both for the dissemination of information (''History Against the Pagans'' was one of the main sources of information regarding Antiquity that was used up to the [[Renaissance]]) and for rationalising the study of history (his methodology greatly influenced later historians).&lt;ref name="torres81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="torres82"/&gt;

== Biographical sources ==
Despite the importance of his books many questions remain regarding his life, hampering efforts to construct a biography with any certainty. This is particularly true for sources of information regarding his birth and death.&lt;ref name="torres16"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his life has been widely studied and there are a number of authors who propose dates for both events.

The main biographical references for Orosius come from the writings of [[Gennadius of Massilia]] and [[Braulio of Zaragoza]], although his own writings should not be overlooked.&lt;ref name="torres16"/&gt; In addition, Orosius is mentioned in letters written by Saint Augustine.

== Questions regarding his identity ==

=== Name ===
While there is no doubt regarding his surname of Orosius, there are questions regarding the use of the name "Paulus". Basically the problem is that it is not completely certain if he used this name or if he was simply called Orosius and whether Paulus has been added with the passing of time. This could have happened given that the initial "P" for [[priest]] was always placed next to his name, and over time this could have led to the confusion.&lt;ref name="torres19"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this idea is flawed as authors writing immediately after Orosius's death use the name Paulus. In fact, even Casimiro Torres Rodríguez, one of the main scholars of Orosius's life, indicates that Paulus might be his Christian name and Orosius his native name, a theory that cannot be entirely dismissed.&lt;ref name="torres19"/&gt;

Whatever the truth of the matter this subject has been widely studied and the most current theory is probably that of Pedro Martínez Cavero, another important Orosius scholar.&lt;ref name="cavero26"&gt;Martínez Cavero, Pedro,  “El pensamiento…”, p. 26. In this section he refers to the author M. P. Annaud-Lindet.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birthplace ===
[[File:Vista braga.jpg|thumb|250px|Panorama of present-day Braga, the most likely birthplace for Orosius.&lt;ref name="cavero22"/&gt;]] The subject of his birthplace is still disputed although a broad consensus has now been reached.&lt;ref name="cavero22"&gt;Martínez Cavero, Pedro,  “El pensamiento…”, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Basically there are four theories regarding his birthplace, that can be summarised as follows:

* ''Born in [[Braga]]'': this idea is most widely accepted as it has the most evidence supporting it. If he was not born in Braga, it is likely he was born in the area around the town. This idea is supported by Orosius's own works and two letters written by Saint Augustine, the 166th and the 169th.&lt;ref name="cavero22"/&gt;
* ''Born in [[Tarragona]]'': this theory has been put forward because in his ''Histories'' Orosius talks of "Tarraconem nostra" (our Tarragona). The 19th-century author Teodoro de Mörner&lt;ref&gt;Theodor von Mörner was a 19th-century historian who wrote ''De Orosii Vita Eiusque Historiarum Libris Septem Adversus Paganos''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5AjSqsEt3MoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0]&lt;/ref&gt; held this opinion, but nowadays it does not seem reasonable to support the idea solely based on one indication.&lt;ref name="cavero24"&gt;Martínez Cavero, Pedro,  “El pensamiento…”, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Originated in [[A Coruña]] (Brigantia)'': this is a relatively new theory solely based on the fact that Orosius twice mentioned it in the geographical section of his ''Histories''.
* ''Originated in [[Brittany]]'': like the previous theory the supporting data for this theory rests on the fact that Orosius had some knowledge of this area.&lt;ref name="cavero25"&gt;Martínez Cavero, Pedro, “El pensamiento…”, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Date of birth ===
Lastly, his supposed date of birth varies between sources, however, a likely date has now been calculated. It is known for certain that in 415 Saint Augustine referred to Paulus Orosius as "a young priest", which means that at that time he could not have been older than 40, as he was young, and he had to be older than 30, as he was a priest.&lt;ref name="torres27"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, his date of birth can be fixed as being between 375 and 385, although the most widely accepted date is considered to be 383. This assumes that when Orosius met Saint Augustine he was 32 years old, that is, he had been an ordained priest for two years.&lt;ref name="cavero26"/&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Despite the scarcity of sources, if his date of birth is accepted as that given above or at least within the window between 375 and 385 it can be seen that Orosius grew up during a period of cultural flourishing along with [[Hydatius]] and the Ávitos.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Martínez Cavero refers to a discussion of this theme by J. E. López Pereira in his “Cultura y literatura latinas en el NO peninsular en la latinidad tardía”.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Priscillianism]] was an important doctrine at this time and it is considered likely that after entering the [[priesthood]] he took an interest in the Priscillianist [[controversy]], which was being widely debated in his native country.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The classical theories suggest that Orosius belonged to a family with good social standing,&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Martínez Cavero this time refers to author G. Fainck.&lt;/ref&gt; which would have allowed him to gain a good education. This would have developed along [[Christian]] lines, although assuming that Orosius was born in Braga, he would also have had a good knowledge of the rural culture of that time.

Contemporary histories indicate that from an early age Orosius was loquacious and erudite,&lt;ref&gt;Both Martínez Cavero and Torres Rodríguez maintain this in books mentioned in the bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; alluding to statements to this effect made by both Saint Augustine and [[Pope]] [[Pope Gelasius I|Gelasius I]].  In any case, any discussion of Orosius's youth is pure speculation and conjecture because, as discussed above, there is little knowledge regarding this period of his life.

=== Journey to Africa ===
[[Image:Viajes de Orosio.svg|thumb|450px|Schematic map showing all the journeys made by Paulus Orosius.&lt;ref&gt;Drawn by the author from information contained in Martínez Cavero, Pedro, “El pensamiento…”, Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…” and others.&lt;/ref&gt;]]It is thought that Paulus Orosius lived in [[Gallaecia]] (northwest [[Hispania]]) until 409, but after that time and up until 415, there is no concrete information regarding his life. The traditional chronology, or at least the most widespread,&lt;ref name="cavero29"&gt;Martínez Cavero, Pedro,  “El pensamiento…”, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes the succession of events outlined in the following paragraphs.

It appears that Orosius had to leave Braga as a result of the [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]] of the Roman Empire. The date of his departure is in some doubt, however, what is known for certain is that he had to leave suddenly.  This is even confirmed by Orosius himself who states that he was pursued onto the beach from which he set sail.&lt;ref&gt;Paulo Orosio, “Historias…”, III 20, 6-7, cited in turn by Martínez Cavero, Pedro, “El pensamiento…”, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of dates have been suggested for his departure from Braga, ranging from 409 to 414, however, the best option is to stick with the two most widely accepted dates:

* 410: proposed by G. Fainck. This date means that Orosius had a window of 5 years for his collaboration with Saint Augustine before he travelled to Palestine.
* 414: which is the most widely accepted. In his book ''Commonitorium'', which was published in 414, Orosius talks of his arrival, his meeting with Saint Augustine etc.

What is certain is that once Orosius had left the [[Iberian Peninsula]] he was certain that his destination was Hippo (now [[Hippo Regius|Annaba]] in [[Algeria]]), and a meeting with Saint Augustine, who was the greatest thinker of his time. From his arrival Orosius formed part of a team that worked alongside Saint Augustine. It is therefore possible that Orosius collaborated in the writing of ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' or at the least that he was aware of the book.&lt;ref name="caver35"&gt;Martínez Cavero, Pedro,  “El pensamiento…”, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 415 Saint Augustine entrusted Orosius with the task of travelling to Palestine to meet with the thinker Saint [[Jerome]] who at that time was living in [[Bethlehem]].  This indicates that Saint Augustine had a great deal of faith in Orosius as relations between Saint Augustine and Saint Jerome had not always been good.

=== Journeys to Palestine ===
The visit to Palestine had a double purpose: Orosius wanted to discuss a number of theological topics with Saint Jerome, particularly those relating to the soul's origins, and Saint Augustine wanted closer ties with the thinker and to gather information regarding the [[Priscillian]]ists, [[Origen]]ists and the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian heresy]].&lt;ref name="cavero39"&gt;Martínez Cavero, Pedro,  “El pensamiento…”, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, it would seem that Orosius's main task was to assist Jerome and others against [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]], who, after the [[synod]] of [[Carthage]] in 411, had been living in Palestine, and finding some acceptance there. Orosius met with Pelagius on Saint Augustine's behalf and he represented the orthodox party against the Pelagians at the [[Synod of Jerusalem]]&lt;ref&gt;Merrills, A. H., ''History and Geography in Late Antiquity'', Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought fourth Series, Cambridge University Press, Melbourne, 2005, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; that was held in June 415.

At the synod Orosius communicated the decisions of the synod of Carthage and read several of Augustine's writings against Pelagius.  Success, however, was not achieved among Greeks who did not understand [[Latin]], and whose sense of reverence was unfased by Pelagius's famous question, ''Et quis est mihi Augustinus?'' ("Who is Augustine to me?")

Orosius succeeded only in obtaining John's consent to send letters and deputies to [[Pope Innocent I]] of [[Rome]]; and, after having waited long enough to learn the unfavourable decision of the [[Synod of Diospolis]] (Lydda) in December of the same year, he returned to North Africa,

Orosius had a confrontation with the [[Archbishop]] of Jerusalem, [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John II]] at the synod, in which Orosius was accused of heresy in front of the entire conclave.  As his defence Orosius wrote his second book ''Liber Apologeticus'', in which he emphatically rejected the accusation.&lt;ref name="cavero42"&gt;Martínez Cavero, Pedro,  “El pensamiento…”, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orosius's first act on meeting Saint Jerome was to hand him the correspondence that he had brought from Saint Augustine.  This implies that the journey was always conceived of as a return journey as Orosius would have to deliver the letters from Saint Jerome back to Saint Augustine. In parallel to this, the relics of Saint Stephen were uncovered at the end of 415 and part of the find was given to Orosius in order that he could take it back to Braga.&lt;ref name="cavero43"&gt;Martínez Cavero, Pedro,  “El pensamiento…”, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; This marks both the start of his return journey and, from our current perspective, a new epoch in Orosius's life that is lacking in sources of information for its study.

=== Later years ===
Given that Saint Stephen's relics were uncovered on 26 December 415, Orosius must have departed from Palestine after that date.  Although his idea was to travel to Braga, he was forced to pass through Hippo as it is known that he delivered letters from Jerome to Saint Augustine, it is also generally agreed that he passed through Jerusalem and [[Alexandria]], although it is not known if he visited the latter on his outward journey, on his return journey or on both occasions.&lt;ref name="cavero45"&gt;Martínez Cavero, Pedro, “El pensamiento…”, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his second stay in Hippo he had a long conversation with Saint Augustine during which he handed over the letters he was carrying from Jerome and informed Saint Augustine about the meetings he had had with Pelagius.&lt;ref name="cavero47"&gt;Martínez Cavero, Pedro,  “El pensamiento…”, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for Orosius's great work, ''Historiae Adversus Paganos'', was born during this reencounter with Saint Augustine.  However, it is difficult to estimate an exact date for when the book was written and for when the book was finished. This has given rise to a number of theories regarding the writing of the book:

* The traditional theory states that the book was finished between 416 and 417.&lt;ref name="cavero5253"&gt;Martínez Cavero, Pedro,  “El pensamiento…”, p. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;  Support for these dates comes from the fact that the ''Liber Apologeticus'' does not mention Orosius's work as a historian, and the prologue refers to ''Book XI'' of the ''City of God'' by Saint Augustine, which was not published until 416. In order to justify how Orosius managed to write seven books in such a short time it is argued that he could have written summaries that were later filled out.
* A recent theory, proposed by Casimiro Torres Rodríguez, states that Orosius briefly stayed in Stridon a second time while trying to return to Portugal, which he was unable to do and he wrote the book during a third stay in Stridon. This would explain why Orosius refers in the “Histories” to events that took place in Hispania in 417.
* A third, older, theory, posed by T. von Mörner and G. Fainck, says that Orosius undertook the work before he travelled to Palestine. In fact, this idea has recently been given a new lease of life by M. P. Annaud-Lindet, although with the proviso that Orosius wrote the book during his return journey from Palestine.

=== Disappearance ===
Very little information is available regarding the life of Paulus Orosius after the publication of his ''Histories''.  It is known that he was in [[Menorca]] where he used the remains of Saint Stephen in attempts to convert members of the [[Jew]]ish community to Christianity, but the date of his death is not known. This lack of information regarding Orosius could be due to cooling of relations with Saint Augustine, who never makes any clear unambiguous references to Orosius's "Histories" once they have been published.  [[Gennadius of Massilia]] considers that Orosius lived at least until the end of the Roman emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Flavio Honorio]]’s mandate, which lasted until 423. However, there is no news of Orosius after 417 and it seems unlikely that such an active author would go six years without publishing anything new.&lt;ref name="cavero57"&gt;Martínez Cavero, Pedro,  “El pensamiento…”, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other theories, from a sudden death to a range of legends that talk of Orosius's final arrival in Hispania and his founding of a monastery near to [[Cabo de Palos]] where he ended his days, although this latter idea now seems improbable.&lt;ref name="cavero57"/&gt;

== His works ==

=== ''{{lang|la|Commonitorium}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Liber Apologeticus}}'' ===
[[File:Sandro Botticelli 050.jpg|thumb|The ''{{lang|la|Commonitorium}}'' and the ''Histories'' are a response, at least in their origins, to the direct influence that [[Saint Augustine]] exercised over Orosius.&lt;ref name="beltran65"/&gt;]]
Although Paulus Orosius's most important book was the ''{{lang|la|Historiae Adversus Paganos}}'', his other two surviving books must also be taken into account: ''Commonitorium'' and ''Liber Apologeticus''.&lt;ref name="torres18"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio...”, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The full name of his first book is ''{{lang|la|Consultatio sive commonitorium ad Augustinum de errore Priscillianistarum et Origenistarum}}'' (in {{lang-en|Warnings and Reminders by Augustine Against the Errors of the Priscillians and the Origenists}}).&lt;ref name="beltran65"&gt;Beltrán Corbalán, Domingo and others, “El Commonitorium...”, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Its chronology is littered with the same grey areas as Orosius's biography. In principle it is a book intended for Saint Augustine and therefore it must have been written before Orosius arrived in Africa, between 409 and 414 as discussed above.&lt;ref name="beltran66"&gt;Beltrán Corbalán, Domingo and others, “El Commonitorium...”, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second chronological limit is 415, which is traditionally considered to be the date when Augustine's book ''{{lang|la|Liber ad Orosium contra Priscillianistas et Origenistas}}'' was published, in which Augustine replies to Orosius's ''{{lang|la|Commonitorium}}''.&lt;ref name="beltran67"&gt;Beltrán Corbalán, Domingo and others, “El Commonitorium...”, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is not only aimed at Saint Augustine but was also preceded by conversations with the saint.&lt;ref name="beltran69"&gt;Beltrán Corbalán, Domingo and others, “El Commonitorium...”, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; It not only describes Orosius journey to Africa, but also summarises the beliefs of [[Priscillianism]] and [[Origenism]], and it asks for Saint Augustine's advice regarding these [[theology|theological]] issues, thereby exposing some of Orosius's theological doubts.&lt;ref name="beltran71"&gt;Beltrán Corbalán, Domingo and others, “El Commonitorium...”, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The full name of Orosius's second book is ''{{lang|la|Liber apologeticus contra Pelagium de Arbitrii libertate}}''.&lt;ref name="torres36"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio...”, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published at the time of Orosius's participation in the Council of Jerusalem in 415.&lt;ref name="torres35"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio...”, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is the result of a theological debate during which [[Archbishop]] [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John II]] accused Orosius of heresy due to his idea that man cannot remain free of sin, not even with the help of divine intervention.&lt;ref name="torres35"/&gt;

In order to defend himself from these accusations Orosius wrote ''{{lang|la|Liber Apologeticus}}'', in which he describes his motives for participating in the synod, he was invited by Saint Jerome, and rejects the accusation of heresy made against him.&lt;ref name="torres36"/&gt; However, neither of these two books are of a historical nature, despite containing elements that help in the reconstruction of Orosius's life.

=== ''{{lang|la|Historiae Adversus Paganos}}'' ===
[[File:Historiae adversus paganos.tif|thumb|''Historiae adversus paganos'', 1561]]
[[Image:Paulo Orosio - Lámina siglo VI.jpg|thumb|250px|Page from a manuscript of Orosius's ''Histories'' held in [[Florence]].]]
Paulus Orosius's masterpiece is ''{{lang|la|Historiae Adversus Paganos}}'', the only history book that he wrote, which gives insight into the historiographical methodology of the Spanish priesthood. It is not possible to be certain as to when it was written as there is no single theory that is unanimously accepted by all historians.  The most common estimate places the drafting of the book between 416 and 417.&lt;ref name="cavero5253"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More detailed information regarding the various theories regarding the date of writing can be found in the sections “Final years” and “Disappearance” of this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miguel Ángel Rábade Navarro offers a clear and concise definition on Orosius's history in one of his articles on the author. In this article Rábade calls the ''Histories'' a "universalist history with an apologetic and [[providentialism|providentialist]] character, whose main aim is to compare a pagan past with a Christian present, through their followers, their actions and their geographical and temporal location".&lt;ref name="rabade377"&gt;Rábade Navarro, Miguel Ángel, “Una interpretación...”, pp. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

Be this as it may, the book had a definite origin and a clear purpose.  The book's origins were a response to Saint Augustine's express desire for a book that would complement his ''{{lang|la|De Civitate Dei}}'' which is a history focused on the pagan races.&lt;ref name="alonso375"&gt;Alonso Ñúñez, José Miguel, “La metodología...”, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;  The date of the book is not our main focus here, what is more important is Orosius's objective in responding to Saint Augustine's request by writing a book aimed at proving that [[Rome]]’s decadence – it should be remembered that [[sack of Rome (410)|Rome was sacked]] by [[Alaric I]] in 410 – had nothing at all to do with the fact that the Romans had relatively recently converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name="garcia287"&gt;García Fernández, Francisco José, “La imagen de Hispania...”, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more general way Orosius wanted to show that the world has improved since the introduction of Christianity rather than declined as others had argued. In response to those who pointed to contemporary disasters, he simply argues that previous disasters occurring before Christianity were much worse. The work, a [[universal history]] of the calamities that have happened to mankind was the first attempt to write the history of the world as a history of God guiding humanity.

Throughout the seven books that comprise the history, Orosius introduces several new methods and he also uses others that pick up on the traditional methods of [[Greek historiography|Graeco]]-[[Roman historiography|Roman]] [[historiography]].&lt;ref name="garcia286"&gt;García Fernández, Francisco José, “La imagen de Hispania...”, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be pointed out that Orosius never offers a negative image of the Pagans, in this way he is being true to the traditions of the Graeco-Roman historians of that time, who always tried to give a positive impression of their "enemies".&lt;ref name="garcia286"/&gt;

== Historical methodology  ==

=== Universalism ===
The Universalist nature of Orosius's work is perhaps its most notable aspect. In fact, despite the lack of agreement regarding all other aspects of Orosius's life, including his biography and his works, most experts agree on the universalist nature of this work, including classicists such as [[Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo]] and even more modern historians such as Torres Rodríguez.&lt;ref name="torres75"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, his works are not only identified as universalist but as the first Christian universalist history, or put another way, the last classical universalist history.&lt;ref name="alonso373"&gt;Alonso Ñúñez, José Miguel, “La metodología…”, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulus Orosius is not only a widely studied author he also described his own thoughts on his historical methodology in some of the prologues to the volumes that comprise his “Histories”. He was always clear in his objectives, he wanted to write the history starting with the creation and leading up to the times in which he lived, which is a clear declaration of his universalist intentions as a historian.&lt;ref name="alonso379"&gt;Alonso Ñúñez, José Miguel, “La metodología…”, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orosius uses the so-called "succession of the four world empires theory" throughout his works,&lt;ref name="rabade378"&gt;Rábade Navarro, Miguel Ángel, “Una interpretación…”, pp. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; which traced world history based on the premise that out of the ruins of one great civilization another arose.  Therefore, his theory was based on four historical empires, [[Babylonia]], pagan Rome, [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] and [[Carthage]], with a fifth empire, that of Christian Rome as the inheritor of all these.&lt;ref name="rabade381"&gt;Rábade Navarro, Miguel Ángel, “Una interpretación…”, pp. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, during the narration of their histories the four empires develop in the same way and there are a number of striking parallels between them that are markedly different from Rome, which Orosius praises.&lt;ref name="rabade377"/&gt;

Orosius's basic innovation in dealing with the four empires theory was to introduce Carthage between Macedonia and Rome, which is something that scholars such as García Fernández point out as one of Orosius's defining and definitive acts.&lt;ref name="garcia287"/&gt;

=== Patriotism and universalism ===
Another important characteristic of Orosius's “Histories” is defined as [[patriotism]].&lt;ref name="torres76"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two clearly defined positions regarding Orosius's patriotism, a more traditional view espoused by Torres Rodríguez and a more novel view as recently outlined by García Fernández.

Torres Rodríguez’ theory refers to patriotism is the sense that Orosius places special emphasis on the events that took place in Hispania. This is normal given Orosius's origins, but it can be thought of not only as patriotism but also as Hispanism.&lt;ref name="torres76"/&gt; Examples of this tendency include narratives of events in the “Histories”, that occurred in Braga or the fact that Orosius himself was charged with transporting the reliquaries of Saint Stephen.&lt;ref name="torres77"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosius…”, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; It is even pointed out that Orosius's narrations are sometimes used by current day groups of [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalists]].&lt;ref name="torres77"/&gt;

On the other hand, in 2005 García Fernández made an explicit allusion to Torres Rodríguez’ theory when he stated that it was an exaggeration to characterize Orosius's historical methodology as “patriotic”.&lt;ref name="garcia293"&gt;García Fernández, Francisco José, “La imagen de Hispania…”, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a rejection of nearly all of the statements made by Torres Rodríguez on this matter.&lt;ref name="garcia294"&gt;García Fernández, Francisco José, “La imagen de Hispania…”, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; García Fernández used the idea of “localism”, which was a fashionable idea amongst historians at the beginning of the 21st century.&lt;ref name="garcia298"&gt;García Fernández, Francisco José, “La imagen de Hispania…”, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea argues that beyond "Hispanism” Orosius shows a “benevolent attitude” to Hispania.&lt;ref name="garcia298"/&gt;

=== Optimism and pessimism ===
Another interesting point is the pessimism with which Orosius deals with certain themes and the exaggerated optimism with which he refers to others. In general he is pessimistic about anything to do with paganism or the past and optimistic regarding Christianity and his present, which is remarkable given the difficult times that he was living in.&lt;ref name="torres63"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

These characteristics infuse all the others, it is particularly noticeable in his narration when he places a special emphasis on the suffering of the defeated,&lt;ref name="torres65"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and the terrors of war.&lt;ref name="alonso377"&gt;Alonso Ñúñez, José Miguel, “La metodología…”, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;  This characteristic can clearly be attributed to the influence of Saint Augustine, as Orosius is showing us the two sides of a coin in the purest style of Augustinian dualism.&lt;ref name="torres64"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orosius is thereby able to present the past as a series of adversities with concrete examples, from [[Flood myth|Noah's flood]] to the shipwrecking of ships in the Mediterranean Sea, and the future as something positive despite the reality of the times in which he lived.&lt;ref name="torres64"/&gt;

In order to follow a narrative of suffering and tragedy he often concentrated on defeats, which was different from the usual Roman historiography which normally gave pre-eminence to victories.&lt;ref name="torres65"/&gt;  However, from a historiographical point of view this approach led to some inconsistencies, as, in order to bring the reader round to his point of view, Orosius sometimes described [[myth]]s and [[legend]]s as if they were historic fact.&lt;ref name="torres66"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another traditional criticism of Orosius's work relates to this dichotomy of pessimism/optimism, which often causes him to offer a narrative that in many ways lacks an objective viewpoint.&lt;ref name="torres68"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; This divides historians into those that view him as biased and others that reject this criticism and justify his approach by saying that Orosius viewed history in the same way as Christians view life.&lt;ref name="torres68"/&gt; Put another way, his approach is justified as being founded in the author's Providentialist character.&lt;ref name="rabade377"/&gt;

=== Narrative ===
The narrative ability of Orosius should also not be overlooked.  The author had a clear objective: that the Christians be defended from the non-Christian Roman's accusations that the sacking of Rome in 410 was a reprimand because the Christians had forsaken the city's traditional pantheon of gods.&lt;ref name="alonso376"&gt;Alonso Ñúñez, José Miguel, “La metodología…”, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orosius's narrative abilities in forwarding this argument therefore went beyond the pessimism/optimism duality that was discussed in the previous section. His basic idea is that the past is always worse than the present, because it is always further from the true religion.&lt;ref name="alonso376"/&gt;

The fact that he had clear objectives ensured that he wrote his stories with a definite end in mind. Therefore, there are events that he narrated with little detail and others that he presents in full detail. Orosius never seems lacking in sources of information, he even affirms that an historian should be selective with those he has, it rather seems that this difference in level of detail reflects the emphasis that he wants to place on reinforcing his ideas.&lt;ref name="alonso377"/&gt;

The fact that his writing has a moral objective and apologist agenda means that he focuses on unusual events, such as the suffering of the general population during wartime.&lt;ref name="alonso379"/&gt; This selection of facts, in large part, enables him to write about patriotism, for example, as he always pays a lot of attention to events in Hispania.

=== The importance of geography ===
Another important aspect of Orosius's work is the importance he placed on geography in his work as a historian.&lt;ref name="torres53"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This is shown in his geographic description of the world in the second chapter of the first of the seven books that comprise the ''Histories''.&lt;ref name="torres53"/&gt;

One failing of his geographical descriptions is his imprecision, such as, for instance, when he overuses the noun "[[Caucasus]]" to refer to other nearby ranges.&lt;ref name="torres56"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this vagueness it is notable that the ''Histories'' include a chapter on geography. This has lent an increased value to his work in modern historiography, mainly thanks to authors such as [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Fernand Braudel]].

=== Sources used by Orosius ===
The sources Orosius used have been investigated by Teodoro de Mörner;{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} besides the Old and New Testaments, he appears to have consulted [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Livy]], [[Junianus Justinus|Justin]], [[Tacitus]], [[Suetonius]], [[Florus]] and a cosmography, attaching also great value to Jerome's translation of the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicles]]'' of [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]].

== Impact of Orosius’s work ==
[[Image:Historias de Orosio - Colofón.jpg|thumb|175px|Colophon from an [[Incunable|incunabulum]] of the ''Historiae Adversus Paganos'' by Paulus Orosius, one of the most copied books from the Medieval period.&lt;ref name="torres82"/&gt;]]The assumed falling out of Paulus Orosius and Saint Augustine at the end of the former's life does not seem to have had a negative effect on the distribution and impact of his ''Histories''.&lt;ref name="torres80"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the previously highlighted criticisms of his work, Orosius's books were considered to be successes from virtually the day of their publication. His ''Histories'' was considered to be one of the main works of Spanish historiography right up until the time of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref name="torres81"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; This success has, to a large extent, meant that his other works have also been conserved.

''Historiae Adversus Paganos'' has been quoted by all types of author from Saint [[Braulio of Zaragoza]] to [[Dante Alighieri]]. Even [[Lope de Vega]] made Orosius a central character in his play ''The Cardinal of Bethlehem'', which shows how long-lived his fame was.&lt;ref name="torres82"&gt;Torres Rodríguez, Casimiro, “Paulo Orosio…”, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the book was not just widely quoted, it was one of the main scholastic books used by students of [[Ancient History]] throughout the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="torres82"/&gt;

Nearly two hundred manuscripts of the “Histories” have survived. An abridged, free translation, often wrongly attributed to [[King Alfred]] is still extant.&lt;ref&gt;Old English text, with original in Latin, edited by H. Sweet, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; The Florentine Judge Bono Giamboni translated it into the Italian.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Tassi, Firenze 1849; partial editions are available in [[Cesare Segre]]’s, ''Volgarizzamenti del Due e del Trecento'', Torino 1953 and in Cesare Segre’s, ''La prosa del Duecento'', Milano-Napoli 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; A still unpublished 14th century Aragonese translation, made by Domingo de García Martín at the request of [[Juan Fernández de Heredia]], comes from Bono Giamboni's Italian translation. The “Histories” was also translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] during the reign of [[al-Hakam II]] of [[Caliph of Cordoba|Córdoba]]. It later became one of the sources of [[Ibn Khaldun]] in his history.

The printed book has been widely copied and there are at least 82 surviving copies and 28 incunables from the first printed editions.&lt;ref name="torres82"/&gt; There are even copies still existing of editions in Italian and German from the 16th Century.&lt;ref name="torres82"/&gt;

There are many 19th century versions of the book still in existence. In fact, a version of the book edited by Torres Rodríguez was used in compiling this article, although there are many equally valid versions in existence, both in Castilian Spanish and in other languages.

{{politics of Armenia}}
This article lists political parties of [[National Assembly of Armenia]] and represents their programs. Armenia became independent state in 1991. Since then many political parties were formed in it, who mainly work with each other to form [[coalition governments]]. Currently the country has a [[multi-party system]].

==Republican Party of Armenia==

[[Republican Party of Armenia]] ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Հայաստանի Հանրապետական Կուսակցություն: ''Hayastani Hanrapetakan Kusakcutyun'')is the ruling party in Armenia. It has the majority of places in National Assembly of the state, 69 out of 131. Its current leader, who is also the president of Armenia is Serj Sargsyan and it was founded in 1990.

==Prosperous Armenia Party==

[[Prosperous Armenia]] party (Armenian: Բարգավաճ Հայաստան Կուսակացություն: ''Bargavatch Hayastan Kusakcutyun'': abbreviation: '''ԲՀԿ''', '''BHK'''). The party was formed in 2004 and its current leader is [[Gagik Tsarukyan]]. There is a debate whether [[Robert Kocharyan]], the first president of the republic has a strong influence over the party. The party is second with the number of members in the national assembly, 37.

==Armenian Revolutionary Federation==

[[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (Armenian:Հայ Հեղափոխական Դաշնակցություն: Hay Heghapokhakan Dashnakcutyun: abbreviation: '''ՀՅԴ''', '''ARF''')

==Rule of Law==

'''Rule of Law''' ({{lang-hy|Օրինաց երկիր}}, ''Orinats’ Yerkir'') abbreviated as ՕԵԿ, OEK, is a centrist political party in Armenia, led by [[Artur Baghdasarian]]. It is the fourth largest party in the [[National Assembly of Armenia]]. In the [[Armenian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 Armenian parliamentary elections]], it only obtained 9 seats in parliament, in contrast to 19 seats in the [[Armenian parliamentary election, 2003|2003 elections]].

In the [[Armenian presidential election, 2008|February 2008 presidential election]], Baghdasarian was the party's candidate; he placed third with 17.7% of the vote according to final official results.

Rule of Law political party is part of the newly formed ruling coalition.

==Way Out Alliance==
In December 2016, the [[Way Out Alliance]], emerged as a liberal political alliance in Armenia. The alliance has a [[Pro-European]] orientation and believes that Armenia should have closer relations with the [[European Union]]. As a result of the [[2018 Armenian protests]], [[Nikol Pashinyan]] was appointed Prime Minister of Armenia and his party, [[Civil Contract (Armenia)]], is a member of the Way Out Alliance liberal coalition.

The '''Royal Ontario Museum''' ('''ROM''', {{lang-fr|Musée royal de l'Ontario}}) is a [[museum]] of [[Art museum|art]], [[Culture|world culture]] and [[natural history]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It is one of the largest museums in [[North America]] and the largest in Canada. It attracts more than one million visitors every year, making the ROM the most-visited in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ROM Announces Record-Breaking 1.35 Million Visitors Annual Attendance|url=https://www.rom.on.ca/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/rom-announces-record-breaking-135-million-visitors-annual|website=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is north of [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]], in the [[University of Toronto]] district, with its main entrance on [[Bloor Street|Bloor Street West]]. The [[Museum station (Toronto)|Museum subway station]] of the Toronto Transit Commission is named after the ROM and since 2008, it is decorated to resemble the institution's collection. 

Established on 16 April 1912 and opened on 19 March 1914, the museum has maintained close relations with the University of Toronto throughout its history, often sharing expertise and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Museum Makers: the Story of the Royal Ontario Museum |last=Dickson |first=Lovat |year=1986 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=0-8020-7441-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was under the direct control and management of the University of Toronto until 1968, when it became an independent [[Crown agency (Ontario)|Crown agency]] of the government of Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jamie|first=Bradburn|title=Historicist: A Handbook to the Royal Ontario Museum, 1956|url=http://torontoist.com/2011/07/historicist_a_handbook_to_the_royal_ontario_museum_1956/|publisher=Torontoist|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rom-trustees&gt;{{cite web|title=ROM Trustees|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/en/about-us/rom-leadership/rom-trustees0|website=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=13 January 2016|quote=The Royal Ontario Museum is an agency of the Government of Ontario.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the museum is Canada's largest field-research institution, with research and conservation activities that span the globe.&lt;ref name="Collections and Research"&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections and Research|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/collections/index.php|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=25 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418191455/http://www.rom.on.ca/collections/index.php|archivedate=18 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Royal Ontario Museum was formally established on 16 April 1912&lt;ref name = "ROM1912"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title =The Royal Ontario Museum Act|abbr =S.O.|year =1912|chapter = 80|link= https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1912onta#page/742/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Our History"&gt;{{cite web|last=Siddiqui|first=Norman|title=Our History|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/en/about-us/rom/our-history|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was jointly governed by the [[Government of Ontario]] and the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Royal Ontario Museum|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/sites/default/files/imce/newsroom_history.pdf|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first assets were transferred from the University and the [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|provincial Department of Education]],&lt;ref name = "ROM1912"/&gt; coming from its predecessor the Museum of Natural History and Fine Arts at the [[Toronto Normal School]].&lt;ref&gt;For the history of the archaeological and ethnographic collection of the Normal School, later given to the ROM, see Gerald Killan, ''David Boyle: From Artisan to Archaeologist,'' Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1983 and Michelle A Hamilton, ''Collections and Objections: Aboriginal Material Culture in Southern Ontario'', Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 March 1914, at 3:00pm, the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]], also the [[Governor General of Canada]], officially opened the Royal Ontario Museum to the public.&lt;ref name="Our History"/&gt; The museum's location at the edge of Toronto's built-up area, far from the city's [[central business district]], was selected mainly for its proximity to the University of Toronto. The original building was constructed on the western edge of the property along the university's [[Philosopher's Walk (Toronto)|Philosopher's Walk]], with its main entrance facing out onto [[Bloor Street]] housing five separate museums of the following fields: Archaeology, Palaeontology, Mineralogy, Zoology, and Geology. This was the first phase of a two-part construction plan that intended to expand the museum towards Queen's Park Crescent, ultimately creating an H-shaped structure.
[[File:XROMandParkPlaza.jpg|thumb|The Royal Ontario Museum in 1930, three years prior to the opening of its renovation and expansion.]] 
The first expansion to the Royal Ontario Museum publicly opened on 12 October 1933.&lt;ref name="rom.on.ca"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History |url=http://www.rom.on.ca/about/history/index.php |publisher=Royal Ontario Museum |accessdate=28 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329071520/http://www.rom.on.ca/about/history/index.php |archivedate=29 March 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation saw the construction of the south wing fronting onto Queen's Park and required the demolition of Argyle House, a Victorian mansion at 100 Queen's Park. As this occurred during the [[Great Depression]], an effort was made to use primarily local building materials and to make use of workers capable of manually excavating the building's foundations.&lt;ref name="rom.on.ca"/&gt; Teams of workers alternated weeks of service due to the physically draining nature of the job. 

In 1947, the ROM was dissolved as a body corporate, with all assets transferred to the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title =The Royal Ontario Museum Act, 1947|abbr =S.O.|year =1947|chapter = 96|link= https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1947onta#page/364/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; This continued until 1968, when the Museum and the [[McLaughlin Planetarium]] were separated from the University to form a new corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title =The Royal Ontario Museum Act, 1968|abbr =S.O.|year =1968|chapter = 119|link= https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1968onta#page/520/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 26 October 1968, the ROM opened the McLaughlin Planetarium on the south end of the property after receiving a $2 million donation from Colonel R. [[Samuel McLaughlin]].&lt;ref name="ROM History"&gt;{{cite web|title=ROM History |url=http://www.rom.on.ca/newsroom/pdf/rom_history.pdf |publisher=Royal Ontario Museum |accessdate=28 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809013541/http://www.rom.on.ca/newsroom/pdf/rom_history.pdf |archivedate=9 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, however, the planetarium's audiences were dwindling and due to budget cuts, the facility was forced to shut down in November 1995.&lt;ref name="ROM History"/&gt; The space temporarily reopened from 1998 to 2002, after being leased to [[Children's Own Museum]]. In 2009, the ROM sold the building to the University of Toronto for $22 million and ensured that it would continue to be used for institutional and academic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=Chrissie|title=Royal Ontario Museum agrees to sell McLaughlin Planetarium site to University of Toronto|url=http://dailycommercialnews.com/article/id32730|accessdate=28 March 2012|newspaper=Daily Commercial News|date=19 February 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220123817/http://dailycommercialnews.com/article/id32730|archivedate=20 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQs |url=http://www.rom.on.ca/about/faqs/faqsgen.php |publisher=Royal Ontario Museum |accessdate=28 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418165727/http://www.rom.on.ca/about/faqs/faqsgen.php |archivedate=18 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:McLaughlin Planetarium - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC09895.JPG|thumb|left|The [[McLaughlin Planetarium]] next to the museum. The planetarium was operated by the museum from 1968 to 2009.]]
The second major addition to the museum was the Queen Elizabeth II Terrace Galleries on the north side of the building and a curatorial centre built on the south, which started in 1978 and was completed in 1984. The new construction meant that a former outdoor "Chinese Garden" to the north of the building facing Bloor, along with an adjoining indoor restaurant, had to be dismantled. Opened in 1984 by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], a $55 million expansion took the form of layered volumes, each rising layer stepping back from Bloor Street-- hence creating a layered terrace effect. The design of this expansion won a [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General's]] [[List of awards presented by the Governor General of Canada|Award in Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arc.co.uk/149600.arx Royal Ontario Museum Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104230145/http://arc.co.uk/149600.arx |date=4 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1989, activists complained about its ''Into the Heart of Africa'' exhibit, which featured [[Ethnic stereotype|stereotypes]] of Africans, forcing curator Jeanne Cannizzo to resign.&lt;ref name="inter"&gt;Petersen, Klaus &amp; Allan C. Hutchinson. "Interpreting Censorship in Canada", [[University of Toronto Press]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in 2002, the museum underwent a major renovation and expansion project dubbed as ''Renaissance ROM.'' The Provincial and Federal governments, both supporters of this venture, contributed $60 million towards the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Renaissance ROM |url=http://rom.on.ca/support/governors/ren_learn_more.php |publisher=Royal Ontario Museum |accessdate=24 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721001731/http://www.rom.on.ca/support/governors/ren_learn_more.php |archivedate=21 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign aimed not only to raise annual visitor attendance from 750,000 to between 1.3 and 1.6 million, but also to generate additional funding opportunities to support the museum's research, conservation, galleries and educational public programs.&lt;ref name="Renaissance ROM Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Renaissance ROM Fact Sheet |url=http://www.rom.on.ca/about/newsroom/pdf/renromfacts.pdf |publisher=Royal Ontario Museum |accessdate=25 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709201456/http://www.rom.on.ca/about/newsroom/pdf/renromfacts.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The centrepiece of the project, the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal, was a major addition to the building's original framework. The structure was created by architect [[Daniel Libeskind]], whose design was selected from among 50 finalists in an international competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lostracco|first=Marc|title=Inside The ROM Crystal: A First Look|url=http://torontoist.com/2007/05/inside_the_rom/|publisher=Torontoist|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design saw the Terrace Galleries torn down (the curatorial centre to the south remains) and replaced with a [[Deconstructivism|Deconstructivist]] crystalline-form structure, named after [[Michael Lee-Chin]] who pledged $30 million towards its construction. Existing galleries and buildings were also upgraded, along with the installation of multiple new exhibits over a period of months. The first phase of the Renaissance ROM project, the Ten Renovated Galleries in the Historic Buildings, opened to the public on 26 December 2005. The architectural opening for the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal, however, took place less than 18 months later, on 2 June 2007.&lt;ref name="Renaissance ROM Fact Sheet"/&gt; The final cost of the project was about $270 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Lee-Chin Crystal Facts |url=http://www.rom.on.ca/about/newsroom/pdf/crystalfacts.pdf |publisher=Royal Ontario Museum |accessdate=25 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709201408/http://www.rom.on.ca/about/newsroom/pdf/crystalfacts.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original building was listed by the City of Toronto on the Municipal Heritage Register on 20 June 1973, designated under Part IV of the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]'' in 2003, with a Heritage Easement on the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://app.toronto.ca/HeritagePreservation/details.do?folderRsn=2437577&amp;propertyRsn=224637|title=Heritage Property Detail, Address: 100 QUEEN'S PARK |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=City of Toronto Heritage Property Register |publisher= |access-date=September 22, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings and architecture==
===Original building and eastern wing===
[[File:Royal Ontario Museum (outside view, 2005).jpg|thumb|The original building was designed in a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival style]], punctuated by rounded and segmented arched windows with heavy surrounds and hood mouldings.]]
Designed by Toronto architects [[Darling and Pearson|Frank Darling and John A. Pearson]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rom.on.ca/about/history/index.php Royal Ontario Museum | About Us | Our History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329071520/http://www.rom.on.ca/about/history/index.php |date=29 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the architectural style of the original building is Italianate [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]], popular throughout North America until the 1870s. The structure is heavily massed and punctuated by rounded and segmented arched windows with heavy surrounds and hood mouldings. Other features include applied decorative eave brackets, [[quoin]]s and [[cornice]]s. 

The eastern wing facing Queen's Park was designed by [[Chapman and Oxley|Alfred H. Chapman and James Oxley]]. Opened in 1933, it included the museum's elaborate [[Art Deco|art deco]], Byzantine-inspired rotunda and a new main entrance. The linking wing and rear (west) façade of the Queen's Park wing were originally done in the same yellow brick as the 1914 building, with minor Italianate detailing. However, the Queen's Park façade of the expansion broke away from the heavy Italianate style of the original structure. It was built in a [[Byzantine Revival architecture|neo-Byzantine]] style with rusticated stone, triple windows contained within recessed arches and different-coloured stones arranged in a variety of patterns. This development from the Roman-inspired Italianate to a Byzantine-influenced style reflected the historical development of [[Byzantine architecture]] from [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]]. Common among neo-Byzantine buildings in North America, the façade also contains elements of [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in its relief carvings, gargoyles and statues. The ornate ceiling of the rotunda is covered predominantly in gold back-painted glass mosaic tiles, with coloured mosaic geometric patterns and images of real and mythical animals.
[[File:DSC09082 - Mosaic Ceiling (36823804840).jpg|thumb|left|The [[mosaic]] ceiling of the [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] is covered predominantly in gold back-painted glass tiles.]]
Writing in the Journal of the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] in 1933, A.S. Mathers said of the expansion: "The interior of the building is a surprise and a pleasant one; the somewhat complicated ornament of the façade is forgotten and a plan on the grand manner unfolds itself. It is simple, direct and big in scale. One is convinced that the early Beaux Arts training of the designer has not been in vain. The outstanding feature of the interior is the glass mosaic ceiling of the entrance rotunda. It is executed in colours and gold and strikes a fine note in the one part of the building which the architect could decorate without conflicting with the exhibits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speeches.empireclub.org/61643/data?n=1 |title=The Museum: Past, Present and Future, by Dr. James E. Cruise |publisher=Speeches.empireclub.org |date= |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original building and the 1933 expansion have been listed since 1973 as heritage buildings of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rom.on.ca/renaissance/heritage.php Heritage of the ROM, accessed 10 November 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040406011308/http://www.rom.on.ca/renaissance/heritage.php |date=6 April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a major renovation of the heritage wings saw the galleries made larger, windows uncovered, and the original early 20th-century architecture made more prominent. The exteriors of the heritage buildings were cleaned and restored. The restoration of the 1914 and 1933 buildings was the largest heritage project undertaken in Canada.&lt;ref name="beijing" /&gt; The renovation also included the newly restored Rotunda with reproductions of the original oak doors, a restored axial view from the Rotunda west through to windows onto Philosophers' Walk and ten renovated galleries comprising a total of {{convert|90000|sqft|m2|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref&gt;ROM Members' News, Winter 2005–6.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the master plan designed by Darling and Pearson in 1909, the ROM took a form similar to that of J.N.L. Durand's ideal model of the museum (published in the early 19th century). It was envisioned as a square plan with corridors running through the centre of the composition, converging in the middle with a domed rotunda. Overall, it referenced the upper-class palaces of the 17th and 18th centuries and aimed at having a strong sense of monumentality. All the architectural elements—the deep cornice, decorative top, eave brackets—add to this strength that the ROM possessed, as it was purely a structure with the function of collecting, but not of exhibiting.&lt;ref name="Browne"&gt;Browne, Kelvin. Bold Visions: the Architecture of the Royal Ontario Museum. Toronto: ROM, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the mid-2010s, the original entrance was used as a café. Since late-2017, the original entrance is undergoing renovation to become an alternate entrance, complete with the addition of ramps to the original entrance.

===Curatorial centre===
Designed by Toronto architect Gene Kinoshita, with Mathers &amp; Haldenby, the curatorial centre forms the southern section of the museum. Completed in 1984, it was built during the same expansion as the former Queen Elizabeth II Terrace Galleries, which stood on north side of the museum. The architecture is a simple [[Modern architecture|modernist]] style of poured concrete, glass, and pre-cast concrete and aggregate panels. The curatorial centre houses the museum's administrative and curatorial services, and provides storage for artifacts that are not on exhibit. In 2006, the curatorial centre was renamed to Louise Hawley Stone Curatorial Centre in honour of the late Louise Hawley Stone, who devoted herself to the ROM throughout her life and she donated a number of artifacts and various collections to the museum. In her will, she transferred C$49.7 million to the Louise Hawley Stone Charitable Trust, created to help with the upkeep of the building and to the acquisition of new artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Ontario Museum's News Release|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|url= http://www.rom.on.ca/news/releases/public.php?mediakey=wjo82sxdiw|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Crystal===
[[File:4.Extension of Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto.jpg|thumb|The museum entrance was moved to The Crystal when it opened in 2007.]]
The controversial Michael Lee-Chin "Crystal," a multimillion-dollar expansion to the museum including a new sliding door entrance on Bloor Street, first opened in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Ontario Museum|url=http://daniel-libeskind.com/projects/royal-ontario-museum|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Deconstructivism|Deconstructivist]] crystalline form is clad in 25 percent [[glass]] and 75 percent [[aluminium]], sitting on top of a [[steel frame]]. ''The Crystal'''s canted walls do not touch the sides of the existing heritage buildings, but are used to close the envelope between the new form and existing walls. These walls act as a pathway for pedestrians to travel safely across "The Crystal." 

The building's design is similar to some of Libeskind's other works, notably the [[Jewish Museum, Berlin|Jewish Museum]] in [[Berlin]], the [[London Metropolitan University|London Metropolitan University Graduate Centre]] and the [[Denver Art Museum|Fredric C. Hamilton Building]] at the Denver Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Libeskin|first=Daniel|title=Prominent Poles|url=http://www.angelfire.com/scifi2/rsolecki/daniel_libeskind.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steel framework was manufactured and assembled by Walters Inc. of [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. The extruded anodized aluminium cladding was fabricated by Josef Gartner in [[Germany]], the only company in the world that can produce the material. The company also provided the titanium cladding for [[Frank Gehry]]'s [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|Guggenheim Museum]] in [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="beijing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beijing.gc.ca/beijing/en/1627.htm |title=Canadian Embassy Beijing: New Rom rising |publisher=Beijing.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=25 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202073901/http://www.beijing.gc.ca/beijing/en/1627.htm |archivedate=2 February 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Royal Ontario Museum (9674325453).jpg|thumb|left|The overall aim of The Crystal was to provide openness and accessibility, seeking to blur the lines between the public area of the street and the more private area of the museum.]]
The overall aim of ''The Crystal'' is to provide openness and accessibility, seeking to blur the lines between the threshold linking the public area of the street and the more private area of the museum. 

The goal is to act as an open threshold where people and artifacts animate the space. On 1 June 2007, the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], [[Michaëlle Jean]], attended the architectural opening of the "Michael Lee-Chin Crystal."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enotes.com/topic/Michaëlle_Jean&lt;/ref&gt; This caused controversy because public opinion had been divided concerning the merits of its angular design. On its opening, ''[[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]]'' architecture critic Lisa Rochon complained that "the new ROM rages at the world," was oppressive, angsty and hellish, while others-- perhaps championed by her ''[[Toronto Star]]'' counterpart, Christopher Hume-- hailed it as a monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/220522 |title='&amp;#39;Toronto Star'&amp;#39;: Inside the ROM crystal; 1 June 2007 |publisher=Thestar.com |date=1 June 2007 |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Not in citation|date=November 2018}} Some critics have gone as far as ranking it as one of the ten ugliest buildings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/roms-crystal-makes-list-of-worlds-ugliest-buildings/article1370744/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=ROM's Crystal makes list of world's ugliest buildings | date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also experienced budget and construction time over-runs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Galleries==
Originally, there were five major galleries at the ROM, one each for the fields of [[archaeology]], [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[paleontology]] and [[zoology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/library/products/blprrom.htm |title=Guide Rating and Review: Large Museum Shops, accessed 10 November 2005 |publisher=Archaeology.about.com |date=12 July 2013 |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the museum pieces were labelled and arranged in a static fashion that had changed little since Edwardian times. For example, the insects' exhibit that lasted up until the 1970s housed a variety of specimens from different parts of the world in long rows of glass cases. Insects of the same genus were pinned to the inside of the cabinet, with only the species name and location found as a description.
[[File:Lobby - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC09843.JPG|thumb|Used as the museum's lobby, the ''Samuel Hall Currelly Gallery'' showcases an assortment of items from the museum's collection.]]
By the 1960s, more interpretive displays were ushered in, among the first being the original dinosaur gallery, established in the mid-1960s. Dinosaur fossils were now staged in dynamic poses against backdrop paintings and models of contemporaneous landscapes and vegetation. The displays became more descriptive and interpretive sometimes, as with the extinction of the woolly mammoth, offering several different leading theories on the issue for the visitor to ponder. This trend continued and up until the present time, the galleries became less staid and more dynamic or descriptive and interpretive. This trend arguably came to a culmination in the 1980s with the opening of The Bat Cave, where a sound system, strobe lights and gentle puffs of air attempts to recreate the experience of walking through a cave as a colony of bats fly out. 

The original galleries were simply named after their subject material, but in more recent years, individual galleries have been named in honour of sponsors who have donated significant funds or collections to the institution. There are now two main categories of galleries present in the ROM: the Natural History Galleries and the World Culture Galleries. 

The ''Samuel Hall Currelly Gallery'' is an exhibition space on Level 1, connecting the east wing of the museum with its western half. The gallery serves as the building's main lobby past the museum's admission area. As opposed to the most galleries at the Royal Ontario Museum, the ''Samuel Hall Currelly Gallery'' is not dedicated to a single subject. Instead, the gallery exhibits an assortment of items from the museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rom.on.ca/en/about-us/rom/exhibition-spaces/samuel-hall-currelly-gallery|title=Samuel Hall Currelly Gallery|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|year=2018|accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costumes and textiles===
[[File:General view - Patricia Harris Gallery of Textiles &amp; Costume, Royal Ontario Museum - DSC09417.JPG|thumb|The ''Patricia Harris Gallery of Costumes and Textiles'' holds around 200 artifacts from the museum's textile and costume collection.]]
The ''Patricia Harris Gallery of Costumes and Textiles'' holds about 200 artifacts from the ROM's textile and costume collections. These pieces, which range from the 1st century BC to the present day, are rotated frequently due to their fragility. Throughout time, textiles and fashion have been used to establish identity and allow inferences to be drawn about a culture's social customs, economy and survival. The gallery is devoted to showcasing transformations in textile design, manufacturing, and cultural relevance throughout the ages. Weaving, needlework, printed archaeological textiles and silks are all located in this space.&lt;ref name=Textiles&gt;{{cite web|title=Patricia Harris Gallery of Textiles &amp; Costume|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/en/exhibitions-galleries/galleries/world-cultures/patricia-harris-gallery-textiles-costume|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactive galleries===
The ''CIBC Discovery Gallery'' was designed to be a kids' learning zone. It houses three main areas: In the Earth, Around the World and Close to Home. The space is inspired by the ROM's collections and enables children to participate in interactive activities involving touchable artifacts and specimens, costumes, digging for dinosaur bones and examining fossils and meteorites. There is also a special area for pre-schoolers.&lt;ref name=Discover&gt;{{cite web|title=CIBC Discovery Gallery|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/en/exhibitions-galleries/galleries/hands-galleries/cibc-discovery-gallery|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Patrick and Barbara Keenan Family Gallery of Hands-On Biodiversity'' introduces visitors to the complicated relationships which occur among all living things in a fun and interactive space. People of all ages can explore touchable specimens and interactive displays while gallery facilitators help visitors discover the living world around them. Mossy frogs, a touchable shark jaw, snake skin and a replica fox's den are just some of the objects that connect visitors to the amazing diversity and interdependence of plants and animals.&lt;ref name=Hands-on&gt;{{cite web|title=Patrick and Barbara Keenan Family Gallery of Hands-on Biodiversity|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/en/exhibitions-galleries/galleries/hands-galleries/patrick-and-barbara-keenan-family-gallery-hands|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural History galleries===
[[File:Biodiversity exhibit - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC00209.JPG|thumb|The second floor of the museum contains collections and samples of various animals.]]
The Natural History galleries are all gathered on the second floor of the museum. The gallery contains collections and samples of various animals such as bats, birds, and dinosaur bones and skeletons. 

''The Life in Crisis: Schad Gallery of Biodiversity,'' designed by Reich+Petch and opened in late-2009, features [[Endangered species|endangered]] species, including specimens of a [[polar bear]], a [[giant panda]], a [[white rhinoceros]], a [[Burmese python]], [[Deep-water coral|Canadian coral]], a [[leatherback sea turtle]], a [[coelacanth]], a [[Rafflesia]] flower and many other rare species. Included among these specimens is [[Southern White Rhino ("Bull")|Bull]], a [[southern white rhinoceros]] that became a famous conservation success story for his species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rom.on.ca/en/node/2840|title=Images|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|year=2018|accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[Holocene extinction|recently extinct]] species displayed, including specimens of a [[passenger pigeon]] and a [[great auk]], as well as skeletons of a [[dodo]] and a [[moa]] with a specimen of a moa egg and many other recently extinct species. The gallery presents the need to protect the natural environment and the need to educate the public about the main causes of [[extinction]]—overhunting, habitat destruction, and climate change. In September 2009, the gallery received an Award of Excellence by the Association of Registered Interior Designers of Ontario. The Schad Gallery of Biodiversity is not merely an exhibition gallery showcasing Earth's wondrous specimens, but a lesson for the future care of the planet. 

The ''Life in Crisis'' gallery is organized into three zones exploring the central themes: Life is Diverse, Life is interconnected, and Life is at Risk. "Interestingly, biodiversity is a relatively new term popularized in 1985 as a contraction of biological diversity" said Anthony Reich, Principal at Reich+Petch. "It's a big subject that's become more relevant to everybody. The challenge was how to tell this big story in a {{convert|10,000|sqft|m2|adj=on|sigfig=1}} space. We decided to design a dynamic, immersive experience with three core themes that hopefully will make a lasting impression on visitors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianinteriors.com/news/reich--biodiversity--petch/1000342195/ |title=Reich + biodiversity + Petch|work= canadianinteriors.com|date= 1 September 2009|accessdate= 1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Tallgrass Prairies and Savannas'' is a part of the gallery that features one of the most endangered and diverse habitats in Ontario. The display features examples of the regions and the efforts by the Ontario [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry]], to maintain and restore the tall grass prairies and savannas.
[[File:Bird exhibit - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC00188.JPG|thumb|left|The museum has a large collections of birds from past centuries for viewing.]]
The ''Gallery of Birds'' has on display many bird specimens from past centuries. The Gallery of Birds is dominated by the broad "Birds in flight" display where stuffed birds are enclosed in a glass display for visitors to experience. Dioramas allow visitors to learn about the many bird species and how environmental and habitual changes have put bird species in danger of extinction. Pull-out drawers let visitors examine eggs, feathers, footprints and nests more closely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallery of Birds |url=http://www.rom.on.ca/exhibitions/nhistory/nhbirds.php |accessdate=26 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121103951/http://www.rom.on.ca/exhibitions/nhistory/nhbirds.php |archivedate=21 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gallery included exhibits of other extinct species such as the passenger pigeon. These exhibits were later moved to the Schad Gallery. 

The Royal Ontario Museum purchased a beached [[blue whale]] off the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] at [[Trout River, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trout River]] and displayed its skeleton and heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/blue-whale-bones-one-step-closer-to-display-1.3645458|title=Digging up bones: Royal Ontario Museum moves to next stage of blue whale project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/blue-whale-mark-engstrom-trout-river-rocky-harbour-rom-1.3655894|title=Researchers hope to learn secrets in blue whale bones|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was displayed as a ROM original travelling exhibit until 4 September 2017. 

The [[Royal Ontario Museum Bat Cave|Bat Cave]] is an immersive experience for visitors that presents over 20 bats and 800 models in a recreated habitat, with accompanying educational panels and video.&lt;ref name=Bats&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bat Cave|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/en/exhibitions-galleries/galleries/natural-history/bat-cave|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally opened in 1988, the bat cave reopened on 27 February 2010 after extensive renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/parent/2010/02/24/the_rom_reopens_the_bat_cave.html |title=The ROM reopens the bat cave, accessed 15 October 2013 |publisher=thestar.com |date=4 February 2010 |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|1700|sqft|m2|adj=on}} exhibit most notably includes a recreation of [[Saint Catherine Parish#Tourist Sites|St. Clair Cave]] located in central Jamaica. The original cave was formed by an underground river that flowed {{convert|30|m}} below ground through the limestone and was three kilometres long. This cave was then recreated in the museum based on ROM fieldwork conducted in Jamaica in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/the-bat-cave-is-back |title=The Bat Cave is back, accessed 15 October 2013 |publisher=rom.on.ca |date=25 February 2010 |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large amount of bat research has been conducted with support from the ROM. In 2011, the ROM hosted a "bat workshop" connected with the 41st Annual North American Symposium on Bat Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batcon.org/pdfs/education/Bat%20Workshop%20Toronto.PDF |title=Bat Workshop:41st Annual North American Symposium on Bat Research, accessed 15 October 2013 |publisher=batcon.org |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rule in Wild's Case''' is a [[common law]] rule of construction dating back to 1599 concerning a particular type of ambiguity in devises (such as grants or [[bequest]]s) of [[real property]]:  If a grantor (O) grants, by [[deed]] or [[Will (law)|will]], property to another person (A) with the language ''"To A and her children"'', who gets lawful [[Possession (law)|possession]] of the property?

The rule resolves this ambiguity as follows:
* If A has living children at the time of the grant, A and her children take the property as [[Concurrent estate|joint tenants]].
* If A does not have living children at the time of the grant, A takes the property in [[fee tail]].

This rule has fallen into disuse in those jurisdictions which no longer recognize the fee tail as a legal estate.  Some [[U.S. state]]s ignore the rule altogether, and interpret such a grant as giving a [[life estate]] and creating a [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] in her children.  Section 14.2 of the [[Restatement of the Law|Restatement (Third) of Property]] repudiates the Rule in Wild's Case, suggesting that many authorities consider it to be obsolete.

The '''''Russian Biographical Dictionary''''' (RBD, {{lang-ru|Русский биографический словарь}}) is a [[Russian-language]] [[biographical dictionary]] published by the [[Russian Historian Society]] edited by a collective with [[Alexander Polovtsov]] as the [[editor-in-chief]]. The dictionary was published in 25 volumes from 1896 to 1918 and considered as one of the most comprehensive Russian biographical sources for the 19th and early 20th century period.

'''SIDSPACE''' is a [[mnemonic]] used in remembering which [[Latin]] [[preposition]]s take the [[ablative]] case.&lt;ref name=a /&gt;&lt;ref name=b /&gt; 

SIDSPACE stands for the following prepositions: sub (during), in (at), de (about), sine (without), pro (before), ab (after), cum (with), and ex (from).&lt;ref name=a&gt;[http://www.gsgis.k12.va.us/facultyweb/cbroeniman/webpages/latin1_files/ablativeWorksheet.doc Ablative case review], Clifford Broeniman, Latin 1, Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies.  Accessed on line December 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;[http://schoolsite.capturepoint.com/assets/resources/Latin%20I%20Obj.pdf Ridgewood High School Latin I Curriculum- 12/05].  Accessed on line December 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not all of these words take the [[ablative]] case in every context, all of them do take it some of the time. For example, 'in' takes the [[ablative]] case when expressing location, as in "He is in Italy," but takes the [[accusative case]] when it is expressing motion, such as "He went into Italy."

The mnemonic omits some of the less common prepositions, which are included in the rhyme:

:''A'', ''ab'', ''absque'', ''coram'', ''de'',
:''palam'', ''clam'', ''cum'', ''ex'' or ''e'',
:''sine'', ''tenus'', ''pro'' and ''prae''.
:''Sub'', ''subter'', ''super'', ''in'' beside
:when state not motion is implied.

A second version goes as follows:

:''A'', ''ab'', ''absque'', ''coram'', ''de'',
:''palam'', ''clam'', ''cum'', ''ex'' or ''e'',
:''sine'', ''tenus'', ''pro'' and ''prae''
:Govern the ablative every day.
:To these, if ''rest at'' is intended,
:''In'', ''sub'', ''super'', must be appended.

{''Sub'' means ''under'' and ''super'' means ''above''.)

A third version is as follows:

:A, ab, absque, coram, de, 
:Palam, clam, cum, ex and e,
:Sine, tenus, pro and prae  
:Plus super, subter, sub and in 
:When rest not motion 'tis you mean.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4105">In [[additive number theory]], the '''Skolem–Mahler–Lech theorem''' states that if a sequence of numbers is generated by a [[Recurrence relation|linear recurrence relation]], then with finitely many exceptions the positions at which the sequence is zero form a regularly repeating pattern. More precisely, this set of positions can be decomposed into the union of a [[finite set]] and finitely many full [[arithmetic progression]]s. Here, an infinite arithmetic progression is full if there exist integers ''a'' and ''b'' such that the progression consists of all positive integers equal to ''b'' modulo&amp;nbsp;''a''.

This result is named after [[Thoralf Skolem]] (who proved the theorem for sequences of [[rational number]]s), [[Kurt Mahler]] (who proved it for sequences of [[algebraic number]]s), and [[Christer Lech]] (who proved it for sequences whose elements belong to any [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0).  Its proofs use [[p-adic analysis]].

==Example==
Consider the sequence
:0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, ...
that alternates between zeros and the [[Fibonacci number]]s.
This sequence can be generated by the linear recurrence relation
:&lt;math&gt;F(i) = F(i-2) + F(i-4)&lt;/math&gt;
(a modified form of the Fibonacci recurrence), starting from the base cases ''F''(1) = ''F''(2) = ''F''(4) = 0 and ''F''(3) = 1. For this sequence,
''F''(''i'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 if and only if ''i'' is either one or even. Thus, the positions at which the sequence is zero can be partitioned into a finite set (the [[singleton set]] {1}) and a full arithmetic progression (the positive [[even number]]s).

In this example, only one arithmetic progression was needed, but other recurrence sequences may have zeros at positions forming multiple arithmetic progressions.

==Related results==
The [[Skolem problem]] is the problem of determining whether a given recurrence sequence has a zero. There exist an algorithm to test whether there are infinitely many zeros, and if so to find the decomposition of these zeros into periodic sets guaranteed to exist by the Skolem–Mahler–Lech theorem. However, it is unknown whether there exists an algorithm to determine whether a recurrence sequence has any non-periodic zeros {{harv|Ouaknine|Worrell|2012}}.

A '''specification''' often refers to a set of documented [[requirements]] to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 |title=Form and Style of Standards, ASTM Blue Book
|date=2012 |publisher=[[ASTM International]]
 |url=http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/Blue_Book.pdf
 |accessdate=5 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A specification is often a type of [[technical standard]].

There are different types of technical or engineering specifications (specs), and the term is used differently in different technical contexts. They often refer to particular documents, and/or particular information within them. The word ''specification'' is broadly defined as "to state explicitly or in detail" or "to be specific". 

Using the term "specification" without a clear indication of what kind is confusing and considered bad practice.{{who says|date=December 2017}}

A '''requirement specification''' is a documented [[requirement]], or set of documented requirements, to be satisfied by a given material, design, product, service, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 |title=Form and Style of Standards, ASTM Blue Book
|date=2012 |publisher=[[ASTM International]]
 |url=http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/Blue_Book.pdf
 |accessdate=5 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common early part of [[engineering design]] and [[product development]] processes, in many fields.

A '''functional specification''' is a kind of requirement specification, and may show functional block diagrams.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

A '''design or product specification''' describes the features of the ''solutions'' for the Requirement Specification, referring to either a designed solution '''or''' final produced solution. It is often used to guide fabrication/production. Sometimes the term ''specification'' is here used in connection with a [[data sheet]] (or ''spec sheet''), which may be confusing. A data sheet describes the technical characteristics of an item or product, often published by a manufacturer to help people choose or use the products. A data sheet is not a technical specification in the sense of informing how to produce.

An "'''in-service'''" or "'''maintained as'''" '''specification''', specifies the conditions of a system or object after years of operation, including the effects of wear and maintenance (configuration changes).

Specifications are a type of technical standard that may be developed by any of various kinds of organizations, both [[public sector|public]] and [[private sector|private]]. Example organization types include a [[corporation]], a [[consortium]] (a small group of corporations), a [[trade association]] (an industry-wide group of corporations), a national government (including its [[military]], [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]], and national laboratories and institutes), a [[professional association]] (society), a purpose-made [[standards organization]] such as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], or vendor-neutral developed generic requirements. It is common for one organization to ''refer to'' (''reference'', ''call out'', ''cite'') the standards of another. Voluntary standards may become mandatory if adopted by a government or business contract.

==Use==
In [[engineering]], [[manufacturing]], and [[business]], it is vital for [[suppliers]], purchasers, and users of materials, products, or services to understand and agree upon all requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 108. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A specification may refer to a [[Technical standard|standard]] which is often referenced by a [[contract]] or procurement document, or an otherwise agreed upon set of requirements (though still often used in the singular). In any case, it provides the necessary details about the specific requirements.

Standards for specifications may be provided by government agencies, standards organizations ([[ASTM]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]], [[United States Military Standard|DoD]], etc.), trade associations, corporations, and others. The following [[British standards]] apply to specifications:
*BS 7373-1:2001 Guide to the preparation of specifications &lt;ref&gt;[https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030050705 BS 7373-1:2001]&lt;/ref&gt;
*BS 7373-2:2001 Product specifications. Guide to identifying criteria for a product specification and to declaring product conformity &lt;ref&gt;[https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030018116 BS 7373-2:2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

A design/product specification does not necessarily prove a product to be correct or useful in every context. An item might be [[Verification and validation|verified]] to comply with a specification or stamped with a specification number: this does not, by itself, indicate that the item is fit for other, non-validated uses. The people who use the item (engineers, trade unions, etc.) or specify the item (building codes, government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to consider the choice of available specifications, specify the correct one, enforce compliance, and use the item correctly. [[Verification and Validation|Validation]] of suitability is necessary.

Sometimes a guide or a [[standard operating procedure]] is available to help write and format a good specification.&lt;ref name=eswg&gt;{{cite web

==Construction specifications==
===Construction Specifications in North America===
Specifications in North America form part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of  building and infrastructure projects. Specifications describe the quality and performance of building materials, using code citations and published standards, whereas the drawings or Building Information Model (BIM) illustrates quantity and location of materials. The guiding master document of names and numbers is the latest edition of [[MasterFormat]]. This  is a consensus document that is jointly sponsored by two professional organizations: [[Construction Specifications Canada]] and Construction Specifications Institute based in the United States and updated every two years.

While there is a tendency to believe that "Specifications overrule Drawings" in the event of discrepancies between the text document and the drawings, the actual intent must be made explicit in the contract between the Owner and the Contractor. The standard AIA (American Institute of Architects) and EJCDC (Engineering Joint Contract Documents Committee) states that  the drawings and specifications are  complementary, together providing the information required for a complete facility. Many public agencies, such as the Naval Facilities Command (NAVFAC) state that the specifications overrule the drawings. This is based on the idea that words are easier for a jury (or mediator) to interpret than drawings in case of a dispute.

The standard listing of construction specifications falls into [[50 Divisions]], or broad categories of work types and work results involved in construction. The divisions are subdivided into sections, each one addressing a specific material type (concrete) or a work product (steel door) of the construction work. A specific material may be covered in several locations, depending on the work result: stainless steel (for example) can be covered as a sheet material used in Flashing and Sheet Metal in Division 07; it can be part of a finished product, such as a handrail, covered in Division 05; or it can be a component of building hardware, covered in Division 08. The original listing of specification divisions was based on the time sequence of construction, working from exterior to interior, and this logic is still somewhat followed as new materials and systems make their way into the construction process.

Each Section is subdivided into three distinct Parts: "General", "Products" and "Execution". The MasterFormat  and Section Format &lt;ref&gt;Construction Specifications Institute&lt;/ref&gt;system can be successfully applied to residential, commercial, civil, and industrial construction. Although many Architects find the rather voluminous commercial style of specifications too lengthy for most residential projects and therefore either produce more abbreviated specifications of their own or use ArCHspec (which was specifically created for residential projects). Master specification systems are available from multiple vendors such as Arcom, Visispec, BSD, and Spectext. These systems were created to standardize language across the United States and are usually subscription based.

Specifications can be either "performance-based", whereby the specifier restricts the text to stating the performance that must be achieved by the completed work, "prescriptive" where the specifier states the specific criteria such as fabrication standards applicable to the item, or "proprietary", whereby the specifier indicates specific products, vendors and even contractors that are acceptable for each workscope. In addition, specifications can be "closed" with a specific list of products, or "open" allowing for substitutions made by the Contractor. Most construction specifications are a combination of performance-based and proprietrary types, naming acceptable manufacturers and products while also specifying certain standards and design criteria that must be met.

While North American specifications are usually restricted to broad descriptions of the work, [[Europe]]an ones and Civil work  can include actual work quantities, including such things as [[area]] of [[drywall]] to be built in square meters, like a bill of materials. This type of specification is a collaborative effort between a specwriter and a [[quantity surveyor]]. This approach is unusual in North America, where each bidder performs a quantity survey on the basis of both drawings and specifications. In many countries on the European continent, content that might be described as "specifications" in the United States are covered under the building code or municipal code.   Civil and infrastructure work in the United States often includes a quantity breakdown of the work to be performed as well. 

Although specifications are usually issued by the [[architect]]'s office, specification writing itself is undertaken by the architect and the various [[architectural engineering|engineer]]s or by specialist specification writers. Specification writing is often a distinct professional trade, with professional certifications such as "Certified Construction Specifier" (CCS)  available through the Construction Specifications Institute and the  Registered Specification Writer (RSW)&lt;ref&gt;CSC-dcc.ca/Certification&lt;/ref&gt;  through Construction Specifications Canada. Specification writers are either employees of or sub-contractors to architects, engineers, or construction management companies. Specification writers frequently meet with manufacturers of [[building materials]] who seek to have their products specified on upcoming construction projects so that contractors can include their products in the estimates leading to their proposals.

In February 2015, ArCHspec went live, from ArCH (Architects Creating Homes), a nationwide American professional society of Architects whose purpose is to improve residential architecture. ArCHspec was created specifically for use by Licensed Architects while designing SFR (Single Family Residential) architectural projects. Unlike the more commercial CSI (50+ division commercial specifications), ArCHspec utilizes the more recognizable 16 traditional Divisions, plus a Division 0 (Scope &amp; Bid Forms) and Division 17 (low voltage). Many architects, up to this point, did not provide specifications for residential designs, which is one of the reasons ArCHspec was created: to fill a void in the industry with more compact specifications for residential use. Shorter form specifications documents suitable for residential use are also available through Arcom, and follow the 50 division format, which was adopted in both the United States and Canada starting in 2004. The 16 division format is no longer considered standard, and is not supported by either CSI or CSC, or any of the subscription master specification services, data repositories, product lead systems, and the bulk of governmental agencies.

===Construction specifications in Egypt===
Specifications in [[Egypt]] form part of contract documents. The Housing and Building National Research Center ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150520220731/http://www.hbrc.edu.eg/en/Home.html HBRC]) is responsible for developing construction specifications and codes. The HBRC has published more than 15 books which cover building activities like earthworks, plastering, etc.

===Construction specifications in the UK===
Specifications in the UK are part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of a building. They are prepared by construction professionals such as [[architects]], [[architectural technologists]], [[structural engineer]]s, [[landscape architect]]s and [[Building services engineering|building services engineers]]. They are created from previous project specifications, in-house documents or master specifications such as the [[National Building Specification]] (NBS). The National Building Specification is owned by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) through their commercial group RIBA Enterprises (RIBAe). NBS master specifications provide content that is broad and comprehensive, and delivered using software functionality that enables specifiers to customize the content to suit the needs of the project and to keep up to date.

UK project specification types fall into two main categories prescriptive and performance. Prescriptive specifications define the requirements using generic or proprietary descriptions of what is required, whereas performance specifications focus on the outcomes rather than the characteristics of the components.

Specifications are an integral part of [[Building Information Modeling]] and cover the non-geometric requirements.

==Food and drug specifications==
Pharmaceutical products can usually be tested and qualified by various [[Pharmacopoeia]]. Current existing pharmaceutical standards include:
* [[British Pharmacopoeia]]
* [[European Pharmacopoeia]]
* [[Japanese Pharmacopoeia]]
* [[The International Pharmacopoeia]]
* [[United States Pharmacopeia]]

If any pharmaceutical product is not covered by the above [[Technical standard|standards]], it can be evaluated by the additional source of [[Pharmacopoeia]] from other nations, from industrial specifications, or from a standardized [[formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] such as

* [[British National Formulary for Children]]
* [[British National Formulary]]
* [[National Formulary]]

A similar approach is adopted by the food manufacturing, of which [[Codex Alimentarius]] ranks the highest standards, followed by regional and national standards.&lt;ref name=anzfsc&gt;{{cite web
  | last = [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]]

The coverage of food and drug [[Technical standard|standards]] by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] is currently less fruitful and not yet put forward as an urgent agenda due to the tight restrictions of regional or national constitution&lt;ref&gt;[[Food labeling regulations]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifications and other standards can be externally imposed as discussed above, but also internal manufacturing and quality specifications.  These exist not only for the [[food]] or [[pharmaceutical]] product but also for the processing [[machinery]], [[Quality (business)|quality]] processes, [[packaging]], [[logistics]] ([[cold chain]]), etc. and are exemplified by ''ISO 14134'' and ''ISO 15609''&lt;ref name=oois&gt;{{cite web

The converse of explicit statement of specifications is a process for dealing with observations that are out-of-specification.  The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|United States Food and Drug Administration]] has published a non-binding recommendation that addresses just this point.&lt;ref name=CDER2006&gt;{{Cite book

At the present time, much of the information and regulations concerning food and food products remain in a form which makes it difficult to apply automated information processing, storage and transmission methods and techniques.

Data systems that can process, store and transfer information about food and food products need formal specifications for the representations of data about food and food products in order to operate effectively and efficiently.

Development of formal specifications for food and drug data with the necessary and sufficient clarity and precision for use specifically by digital computing systems have begun to emerge from government agencies and standards organizations.

The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|United States Food and Drug Administration]] has published specifications for a "Structured Product Label" which drug manufacturers must by mandate use to submit electronically the information on a drug label.&lt;ref name=fdaspl&gt;{{cite web

Recently, [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] has made some progress in the area of food and drug [[Technical standard|standards]] and formal specifications for data about regulated substances through the publication of ''ISO 11238''&lt;ref name=iso11238&gt;{{cite web

==Information technology==

===Specification need===
In many contexts, particularly software, specifications are needed to avoid errors due to lack of compatibility, for instance, in interoperability issues.

For instance, when two applications share Unicode data, but use different normal forms or use them incorrectly, in an incompatible way or without sharing a minimum set of interoperability specification, errors and data loss can result. For example, Mac OS X has many components that prefer or require only decomposed characters (thus decomposed-only Unicode encoded with UTF-8 is also known as "UTF8-MAC"). In one specific instance, the combination of OS X errors handling composed characters, and the [[samba (software)|samba]] file- and printer-sharing software (which replaces decomposed letters with composed ones when copying file names), has led to confusing and data-destroying interoperability problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=2727174&amp;group_id=8642&amp;atid=108642 Sourceforge.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.macosxhints.com/archive/index.php/t-99344.html Forums.macosxhints.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications may avoid such errors by preserving input code points, and only normalizing them to the application's preferred normal form for internal use.

Such errors may also be avoided with algorithms normalizing both strings before any binary comparison.

However errors due to file name encoding incompatibilities have always existed, due to a lack of minimum set of common specification between software hoped to be inter-operable between various file system drivers, operating systems, network protocols, and thousands of software packages.

===Formal specification===
{{Main|Formal specification}}
A '''formal specification''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] description of [[software]] or [[computer hardware|hardware]] that may be used to develop an [[implementation]]. It describes ''what'' the system should do, not (necessarily) ''how'' the system should do it. Given such a specification, it is possible to use [[formal verification]] techniques to demonstrate that a candidate system design is correct with respect to that specification. This has the advantage that incorrect candidate system designs can be revised before a major investment has been made in actually implementing the design. An alternative approach is to use provably correct [[Program refinement|refinement]] steps to transform a specification into a design, and ultimately into an actual implementation, that is correct by construction.

===Architectural specification===
In (hardware, software, or enterprise) systems development, an '''architectural specification''' is the set of [[documentation]] that describes the [[structure]], [[behavior]], and more [[view model|views]] of that [[system]].

===Program specification===
A '''program specification''' is the definition of what a [[computer program]] is expected to do. It can be ''informal'', in which case it can be considered as a user manual from a developer point of view, or ''[[Formal specification|formal]]'', in which case it has a definite meaning defined in [[mathematics|mathematical]] or programmatic terms. In practice, many successful specifications are written to understand and fine-tune applications that were already well-developed, although [[safety-critical]] [[software systems]] are often carefully specified prior to application development. Specifications are most important for external interfaces that must remain stable.

===Functional specification===
{{Main|Functional specification}}
In [[software development]], a '''functional specification''' (also, '''functional spec''' or '''specs''' or '''functional specifications document (FSD)''') is the set of [[documentation]] that describes the behavior of a computer program or larger [[software system]]. The documentation typically describes various inputs that can be provided to the [[software]] system and how the [[system]] responds to those inputs.

===Web service specification===

In [[Navajo mythology]], Spider Woman (''Na'ashjé'íí Asdzáá'') is the constant helper and protector of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legendary Native American Figures: Spider Woman (Na'ashjéii Asdzáá)|url=http://www.native-languages.org/spider-woman.htm|publisher=Native Languages of the Americas|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Diné Bahaneʼ#Spider Man, Spider Woman and Weaving|Diné Bahaneʼ]]'' creation narrative of the Navajo (recorded 1928) includes a mention of "Spider Man and Spider Woman", who introduced the [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] and the [[loom]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Bryan, Aileen, ''The Diné: Origin Myths of the Navajo Indians'' (Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, "The Age of Beginning", transcribed 1928).

In [[Pueblo Indians|Pueblo]] tradition, Spider Old Woman appears as the equivalent of "[[Tsichtinako|Thought Woman]]" ([[Keresan languages|Keresan]] ''Tse-che-nako, Sussistanako''): while the name of "Thought Woman" was reserved for sacred ceremonies, Spider Woman would be used in the context of everyday discussion or teaching.&lt;ref&gt;"Some confusion is sometimes created concerning Tse che nako and Old Spider Woman, especially in secular discussions. [[Keres people|Kere]] holy men hesitate to mention Tse che nako's name, especially for purely secular discussions; Thought Woman's name is reserved for use only in sacred ceremonies. In secular discussions and teachings, Tse che nako is often symbolically referred to as Old Spider Woman or Spider Woman. "Purley, Anthony F. (1974). "Keres Pueblo Concepts of Deity," ''American Indian Culture and Research'', 1, no.1: 31. Quoted in: Buell, Lawrence (1996). ''The Environmental Imagination: Thoreau, Nature Writing, and the Formation of American Culture'', p.518-519., n.27. Harvard. {{ISBN|9780674258624}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Karl Taube]] in 1983 tentatively connected the South Western "Spider Woman" mytheme with the pre-Columbian [[Teotihuacan]] "[[Great Goddess of Teotihuacan|Great Goddess]]" known from pictorial representations.

== Other regions==
The [[Ojibwe people]] (Chippewa) of southern Canada and northern US speak of Spider Woman, known as ''Asibikaashi'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingham|first1=John Pratt|title=God and dreams : is there a connection?|date=2010|publisher=Resource Publications|location=Eugene, Or.|isbn=9781606086674|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a helper of the people, and inspiring mothers (or other close female relatives) to weave protective [[dreamcatcher|spider web charms]].&lt;ref name=Densmore&gt;Densmore, Frances (1929, 1979) ''Chippewa Customs''.

The [[Choctaw people]] of [[Tennessee]] and [[Mississippi]] tell the story of Grandmother Spider stealing fire, then after animals refused it, bringing fire to humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indigenouspeople.net/spider.htm] "Grandmother Spider Steals the Fire" story {{verify credibility|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Hazen-Hammond (1997, 1999) compiled numerous tales collected from various tribes.&lt;ref&gt;''Timelines of Native American History'' Penguin Group (USA) 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-399-52307-6}}, ''Spider Woman's Web''  (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-399-52546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Murray Mednick]] wrote seven one-act plays called ''The Coyote Cycle'' with the same four characters: [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]], Coyote [[trickster]], Spider Grandmother and Mute Girl.&lt;ref&gt;Mednick, Murray (1993). ''The Coyote Cycles'', Padua Playwright's Press. {{ISBN|978-0-9630126-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These same characters come from traditional Native American stories and myths.

[[File:Strohbären-Empfingen-2000.jpg|thumb|right|Bears of wheat- and peastraw, [[Empfingen]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]]]

A '''straw bear''' (German: ''Strohbär'', plural ''Strohbären'') is a [[Folklore|traditional]] character that appears in [[Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria|carnival processions]] or as a separate [[Festivals#Types of festivals#Seasonal festivals|seasonal custom]] in parts of [[Germany]], mainly at [[Shrovetide]] but sometimes at [[Candlemas]] or [[Christmas Eve]].

The people playing the bears either dress in costumes made of [[straw]], or are actually wrapped in straw. The straw used may be that of [[wheat]], [[rye]], [[oats]], [[spelt]] or [[pea]]straw; twigs and modern artificial materials have also been used. The bears may be relatively realistic in appearance, with detailed [[mask]]s,&lt;ref name=BuchenWebsite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faschenachtinbuchen.de/show.php?page_id=33|title=Buchen Faschenacht Erbsenstrohbär webpage|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or fully rounded headpieces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elferrat-osterburken.de/WB/pages/gruppierungen/strohbE4rgruppe.php|title=Elfarrat Osterburken Faschenachtsverein website: Strohbärgruppe|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or they may be more abstract, with narrow heads like a long, tapering [[wikt:sheaf|sheaf]].

==History==
[[File:Poppelezunft Singen Hooriger Bär Narrentreffen Meßkirch 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hooriger Bär, the pea-straw-covered [[wild man]] from Singen developed from a straw bear]]

Straw bears may be derived from the medieval carnival figure of the [[Wild Man]]. They were also interpreted by early [[folklorist]]s as personifications of [[Winter]], and their appearance in late winter or early spring was seen as a ritual expulsion of winter from the community.&lt;ref name=BuchenWebsite/&gt; Others think they were merely intended to represent the real [[Tame bear|"dancing" bears]] that used to be taken from place to place for entertainment.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The bears were originally accompanied by groups of costumed attendants and musicians and visited houses, [[Beggar|begging]] from door to door. One of the earliest known references is from [[Wurmlingen]] in 1852. In most cases they were rewarded with gifts of eggs, lard and flour (it may have been significant that these three items were white in colour),&lt;ref name=Tagblatt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagblatt.de/Home/nachrichten/tuebingen_artikel,-Frueher-alltaeglich-heute-selten-Strohbaeren-wie-der-Hirschauer-Aeschadreppler-_arid,89683.html|title=Tagblatt: Newspaper report ''Früher alltäglich, heute selten: Strohbären wie der Hirschauer Äschadreppler''|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Fasnetsküchle'' (carnival fritters), or money. At the end of the day the group would share or consume their gifts in a tavern. This ''quête'' (begging) style of custom is no longer practiced; most bears now appear as part of carnival processions, although there are some which still remain independent of the carnival itself.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Straw bears appeared particularly in agricultural communities. Although the tradition is no longer as widespread as it once was, straw bears can still be found in [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Hessen]] (particularly the [[Vogelsberg]]), [[Lower Saxony]], [[Bavaria]], the [[Hunsrück]] and [[Eifel]] areas of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and [[Thuringia]].

Today they are particularly associated with the "[[Swabian–Alemannic Fastnacht|Swabian-Alemannic Carnival]]" or ''Fastnacht'' of southwestern Germany in the area between the upper [[Neckar River]] and [[Lake Constance]] of Baden-Wuerttemberg.  Formerly there were also straw bears in [[Pomerania]], [[Rheinland]] and [[West Germany]]. In some places the straw-swathed characters are not intended to represent bears, and are simply known as straw men.

The decline in popularity of straw characters in carnival today is thought to be largely due to the difficulty of obtaining straw of suitable length and quality. Modern farmers generally prefer [[cultivar]]s with shorter straw, or use chemical sprays to make the straw grow shorter so that their crops are less prone to damage by storms. Artificial materials have replaced straw in a few places.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In other places, such as Hirschauer, where the ''Äschadreppler'' is traditionally clad in peastraw, crops are being specially planted to ensure the supply of the appropriate straw for the costumes.&lt;ref name=Tagblatt/&gt;

Modern straw bear costumes may be kept from year to year; formerly they were often burned at the end of the day on which they were used. This still happens in some places.

==Similar customs in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland==

* '''''Shrovetide processions, Bohemia'''''. In the town of [[Hlinsko]], in the [[Czech Republic]], and six nearby villages (including [[Hamry (Chrudim District)|Hamry]], [[Blatno (Chrudim District)|Blatno]], [[Studnice (Chrudim District)|Studnice]] and [[Vortová]]), in the Hlinecko region of eastern [[Bohemia]], men and boys wearing colourful costumes representing traditional characters spend a whole day going from door to door, accompanied by a brass band, visiting every household in their community. Some of the characters are Straw Men, dressed in costumes made of rice-straw, with blacked faces, and tall, pointed straw hats; they roll on the ground, and embrace women, which is said to confer fertility. Housewives gather straw from the Straw Men's skirts and take it home to feed their poultry. A ritual dance is performed in front of each house, to ensure wealth for the family and a good harvest. At the end of the day the men perform a ritual called "Killing the Mare"; the Mare, one of the group's [[hobby horse]]s, is "killed" for its alleged sins. It is then "[[Resurrection|brought back to life]]" (with alcohol) and a dance ensues, involving the onlookers. This custom has survived despite being banned in the 18th and 19th centuries by the [[Catholic Church]] and in the 20th by the [[Socialism|Socialist]] government. It has now been recognised by [[UNESCO]] as an element of mankind's [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/archives/multimedia/index.php?s=films_details&amp;id_page=33&amp;id_film=1677|title=Unesco website|work=UNESCO Multimedia Archives|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples from ''The Golden Bough''===
* In ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', [[James George Frazer|Sir James Frazer]] described many examples of straw effigies being made in late winter or early spring, mainly during Lent, to represent Carnival, or Death, or Winter, which were dressed up and paraded before being burned or destroyed by other means. Most of his examples are inanimate, but a few involve people dressed in straw.
**''In the [[Erzgebirge]] the following custom was annually observed at Shrovetide about the beginning of the seventeenth century. Two men disguised as Wild Men, the one in brushwood and moss, the other in straw, were led about the streets, and at last taken to the market-place, where they were chased up and down, shot and stabbed. Before falling they reeled about with strange gestures and spirted blood on the people from bladders which they carried. When they were down, the huntsmen placed them on boards and carried them to the ale-house, the miners marching beside them and winding blasts on their mining tools as if they had taken a noble head of game. A very similar Shrovetide custom is still observed near [[Schluckenau]] in Bohemia. A man dressed up as a Wild Man is chased through several streets till he comes to a narrow lane across which a cord is stretched. He stumbles over the cord and, falling to the ground, is overtaken and caught by his pursuers. The executioner runs up and stabs with his sword a bladder filled with blood which the Wild Man wears round his body; so the Wild Man dies, while a stream of blood reddens the ground. Next day a straw-man, made up to look like the Wild Man, is placed on a litter, and, accompanied by a great crowd, is taken to a pool into which it is thrown by the executioner. The ceremony is called “burying the Carnival.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/196/71.html|title=Bartleby.com ''The Golden Bough'' (1922 edition), Sir James George Frazer, Ch 28 The Killing of the Tree-Spirit §1 The Whitsuntide Mummers|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**''…in the region of the [[middle Rhine]], a representative of Summer clad in ivy combats a representative of Winter clad in straw or moss and finally gains a victory over him. The vanquished foe is thrown to the ground and stripped of his casing of straw, which is torn to pieces and scattered about, while the youthful comrades of the two champions sing a song to commemorate the defeat of Winter by Summer.''&lt;ref name=GoldenBoughSummerWinter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/196/71.html|title=Bartleby.com ''The Golden Bough'' (1922 edition), Sir James George Frazer, Ch 28 The Killing of the Tree-Spirit §5 Battle of Summer and Winter|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**''At [[Göpfritz an der Wild|Goepfritz]] in [[Lower Austria]], two men personating Summer and Winter used to go from house to house on Shrove Tuesday, and were everywhere welcomed by the children with great delight. The representative of Summer was clad in white and bore a sickle; his comrade, who played the part of Winter, had a fur-cap on his head, his arms and legs were swathed in straw, and he carried a flail. In every house they sang verses alternately.''&lt;ref name=GoldenBoughSummerWinter/&gt;
**''In the district of [[Aachen]] on Ash Wednesday, a man used to be encased in peas-straw and taken to an appointed place. Here he slipped quietly out of his straw casing, which was then burned, the children thinking that it was the man who was being burned.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/196/153.html|title=Bartleby.com ''The Golden Bough'' (1922 edition), Sir James George Frazer, Ch 62 The Fire-Festivals of Europe §2 The Lenten Fires|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7196">'''Surrey Record Society''' is a [[text publication society]] which edits and publishes historic records relating to the county of [[Surrey]], England. The society concerns itself with the historic county, which includes, in addition to the current administrative county, the areas now forming the [[London borough]]s of [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]], [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]], [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]], and [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond]]. The Society has also published two editions of registers of medieval [[Bishop of Winchester|bishops of Winchester]], Surrey having historically formed part of the [[Diocese of Winchester]].

==History==
The Society was established in 1912, largely on the initiative of [[Hilary Jenkinson]] (1882–1961), then an [[archivist]] at the [[Public Record Office]] and also honorary secretary of the [[Surrey Archaeological Society]]. It had become clear that the Archaeological Society was unable or unwilling to commit itself to a sustained programme of publication of archival sources for the county's history, and Jenkinson believed that an entirely new body was necessary. He became its secretary, and his Record Office colleague M. S. Giuseppi its general editor. Giuseppi stood down in 1924 to be succeeded by Jenkinson, who held the positions of secretary and general editor jointly until 1950. In that year he was elected president of the Society. In these roles, Jenkinson established many of the principles of record editing and publication which were subsequently adhered to not only by the Surrey Record Society itself, but also more widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=[Johnson |first=H.

==Publications==
The Society's first publication, which appeared in two volumes issued in parts between 1913 and 1924, was ''Registrum Johannis de Pontissara'', the register of [[John of Pontoise]] (d. 1304), [[Bishop of Winchester]] 1282–1304.

==Publication numbering and formats==
In the interest of speedy publication, it was the Society's practice in its early decades to issue its texts in serial form, as editing work progressed, in "parts" (or [[Serial (literature)|fascicles]]), with [[Paperback|card covers]]. The intention was that, once all the parts comprising a volume had appeared, members could bind them together. Some volumes were issued in parts irregularly over several years, interspersed with parts of other volumes. Publications were generally issued with two separate numerical identifiers, a volume number and a "number" (i.e. a part number), but the details supplied on the covers and title-pages were not always complete or consistent. The practice led to bibliographical confusion for librarians and readers, and was abandoned after the [[Second World War]]. Beginning with volume 22 (published in 1955), all volumes were issued complete. 

From volume 25 (1964) onwards, all volumes have been published in a uniform [[Sienna#Burnt sienna|burnt sienna]] [[Hardcover|hardback binding]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12925">'''Swift's silver mine''' is an alleged [[silver]] mine whose existence is part of the [[folklore]] of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].  The mine was supposedly discovered in 1760 by an Englishman named Jonathan Swift.&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the Anglo-Irish [[Jonathan Swift|writer of the same name]] (1667-1745).&lt;/ref&gt; The uncertainty of its location is part of the folklore of its existence, with locations ascribed to eastern [[Kentucky]], southwest [[Virginia]] or eastern [[Tennessee]].

==Legend==
The legend of Swift's silver mine is based on accounts given in the journal of an Englishman named Jonathan Swift. Swift claimed to have preceded [[Daniel Boone]] into Kentucky, coming to the region in 1760 on a series of mining expeditions.&lt;ref name=kleber863&gt;Kleber, "Swift's Silver Mines" pp. 863–864&lt;/ref&gt; The journal recounts how a wounded bear led Swift to a vein of [[silver]] ore in a cave, and how that for the next nine years, he made annual treks back to the site of the mine, carrying out "silver bars and minted coins."&lt;ref name="kleber863" /&gt; An article in an 1886 edition of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' tells how Swift supposedly buried a good deal of the treasure at various locations:

{{cquote|John Swift said he made silver in large quantities, burying some thirty thousand dollars and crowns on a large creek; fifteen thousand dollars a little way off, near some trees, which were duly marked; a prize of six thousand dollars close by the fork of a white oak; and three thousand dollars in the rocks of a rock house: all which, in the light of these notes, it is allowed any one who will to hunt for.&lt;ref name=allen&gt;Allen, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later, amid numerous obstacles that included [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] attacks, and a [[mutiny]] by his crew, Swift walled up the cave and discontinued his mining operation.&lt;ref name="kleber863" /&gt; He left his journal in the possession of a Mrs. Renfro, the widow of one Joseph Renfro of [[Bean's Station, Tennessee]], in whom he was purported to have a romantic interest.&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; Before Swift could return to the mine, he was stricken blind and was unable to locate it again.&lt;ref name="kleber863" /&gt;

===Variations===
[[File:Swift's Silver Camp marker.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Historical marker in Campton, Kentucky, reputed to be one of Swift's campsites]]

Settlers in [[Wise County, Virginia]] believed that the mine was located on or around [[Stone Mountain (Virginia)|Stone Mountain]], and that local Indians knew the location of the mine. According to the settlers, an Indian chief named Benge once said that "if the pale face knew what he knew they could shoe their horses cheaper with silver than with iron." They maintain that a captured settler named Hans G. Frenchman was taken to the mine by the Indians. He marked its location, and later escaped his captors and revealed the location of the mine to Swift. In this version of the story, Swift and Frenchman took only enough silver to buy two horses, and on a return trip, were unable to locate the mine.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Grant Jennings |title=Swift's Silver Mines |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~vawise/SilverMine/SSminesGJS.html |accessdate=2007-08-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070805032600/http://www.rootsweb.com/~vawise/SilverMine/SSminesGJS.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation along these lines holds that Swift was taken to the mine by a [[France|Frenchman]] named "Monday" or "Monde". In this version, Swift and Monde are driven from the mine by an Indian attack, and Swift kills Monde for fear that he will reveal the location of the mine to others. Later, when Swift attempts to return to the mine, Monde's hand covers the compass so he cannot tell which direction to proceed.&lt;ref name=bozarth&gt;{{cite web |last=Bozarth |first=Clara |title=The Legend of Swift's Silver Mine |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~vawise/SilverMine/LegendCB.html |accessdate=2007-08-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070815165943/http://www.rootsweb.com/~vawise/SilverMine/LegendCB.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon Mullins, or "Money-making Sol" (born 1782, died 1858) was rumored to have discovered Swift's mines near Pine Mountain in Southwest Virginia.  Solomon lived in what was then known as Holly Creek, but is now Clintwood, Virginia.  Solomon melted the silver down and used one of his slaves to "strike" for him (striking: the head of a hammer is heated until it is a plastic state and struck over a good coin. The coin, being harder than the softened head of the hammer is, therefore, imprinted. The hammer is then allowed to cool thus producing the die). To finish the process, or to imprint the counterfeit coins with official markings, Sol and his slave would relocate to the privacy afforded by caves located on cliffs adjacent Sol's farm. To this day, the cliffs are known as "Sol's Cliffs."

According to local legend, Solomon's "counterfeit" money used more silver, and was worth more, than the official currency at the time.  Apparently, Sol mixed the pure silver with other lesser metals to make his money.  Solomon never disclosed where he obtained the pure silver, but many people speculated that he found the silver in one of the many caves on Pine Mountain close to his farm.

Once, Solomon was caught by a U.S. detective while at work in the cliffs. Reportedly, realizing his predicament, he ordered the man to help with his work, saying "Grab a hammer and strike this." He hoped the action, if taken, would make the detective complicit; regardless of the story's veracity, it didn't do Sol any good. In early 1837, Solomon and two of his 10 children, Peter and Spencer, were brought to trial and were charged with making counterfeit coins. Solomon was found guilty, but fled Virginia before being sentenced. He reportedly died in 1858 and never revealed the location of his source of silver.

Each year in [[Wolfe County, Kentucky]] there is a Swift Silver mine festival in the county seat of [[Campton, Kentucky]] where locals believe the mine may be located near [[Swift Creek (Kentucky)|Swift Creek]].

==Expeditions==
[[John Filson]] is the first person known to have referenced the mine following Swift's death. In 1788, Filson claimed a tract of land supposed to have included a silver mine worked by "a certain man named Swift." Filson disappeared, taking with him any knowledge he may have had as to the mine's location.&lt;ref name="kleber863" /&gt;

Kentucky pioneer [[James Harrod]] may also have believed in Swift's silver mine. According to Harrod's wife, a man named Bridges claimed to have found the mine, and asked Harrod for his help in developing it. Despite the fact that Harrod and Bridges had a dispute over land some years previous, these two and another man entered the wilderness of Kentucky in 1792,&lt;ref&gt;While Hamilton gives the date as 1793, most other historians give 1792.&lt;/ref&gt; purportedly in search of the mine. Harrod did not return from the trip, and although his body was never found, his wife maintained that Bridges had used the story of the mine to lure him into the woods to murder him.&lt;ref name=hamilton&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~vawise/SilverMine/SSminesEH.html |title=Swift's Silver Mine |last=Hamilton |first=Emory |publisher=''Daily News'' ([[Middlesboro, Kentucky]]) |date=August 1940 |accessdate=2007-08-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070820144919/http://www.rootsweb.com/~vawise/SilverMine/SSminesEH.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Judge [[John Haywood (historian)|John Haywood]] was working on a history of the area around Clear Creek in Kentucky, he observed two "ancient" furnaces that he believed may have been used by Swift.&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt;

In 1854, Professor David Dale Owen was dispatched to [[Bell County, Kentucky]] as part of a geological survey of the state. As part of the survey, Owen examined a location reputed by the locals to be the site of Swift's silver mine. Guided by an explorer named Benjamin Herndon, Owen examined the area and found that it contained "some accidental minerals sparingly disseminated, such as sulphuret of [[Zinc]] and [[lead]] &amp;ndash; which proved on examination to be hydrated silicate of alumina." Owen's survey did not find any significant deposits of silver ore in the area.&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt;

==Skepticism==
Geological evidence casts doubt on the existence of Swift's silver mine. In two centuries, subsequent mining and excavation of the area claimed to have contained the mine have not yielded a single vein of silver ore.&lt;ref name="kleber863" /&gt;

===Regarding the journal===
Skeptical writer [[Joe Nickell]] pointed out that there are numerous versions of the journal upon which the legend of Swift's Silver Mine is based. The best known and most complete of these contains portions plagiarized from a history of Kentucky dating later than the supposed time frame of the journal itself. Because this version is filled with references to [[Freemasonry]] and moral allusions, some historians dismiss the entire tale as an allegory.&lt;ref name="kleber863" /&gt;

===Regarding Swift===
There is the question of Swift himself. No proof exists that there ever was a John or Jonathan Swift who mined silver in Kentucky.&lt;ref name="kleber863" /&gt; (James Dougherty gives alternate first names of "George", "William", and "Tom".)&lt;ref name=dougherty&gt;{{cite web |last=Dougherty |first=James |title=The Legend of Swift's Silver Mine |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~vawise/SilverMine/LegendJAD.html |accessdate=2007-08-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070821113109/http://www.rootsweb.com/~vawise/SilverMine/LegendJAD.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man many considered to be the Jonathan Swift of legend is known to have been alive many years after the purported death of the fabled miner.&lt;ref name="kleber863" /&gt; Nothing is known of this man's ancestry, and what little is known about him personally has been handed down through tradition.&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; If the birth date given in Swift's journal is to be believed, the known Swift would have been an incredible 112 years old at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="kleber863" /&gt;

If there was an actual Jonathan Swift, there is some disagreement as to his character. Tradition holds that he was an established Indian trader, but some historians came to believe he was a [[pirate]] who preyed on [[Spain|Spanish]] merchants and made his frequent trips into the wilderness not to retrieve his treasure, but to hide and coin it. A resident of [[Laurel County, Kentucky]] named William Reams held that following Swift's visit to the mine in 1769 &amp;ndash; the last trip recorded in the journal &amp;ndash; he and his accomplices agreed not to claim any of the treasure they had hidden in the area until 1790. When they did return, Swift was overcome by the sight of the wealth and killed the other members of the party while they slept. Following this action, he was struck blind and unable to recover the treasure.&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt;

Nickell contends that the pirate theory raises more questions than it answers. He contends that a journey into Kentucky was a dangerous undertaking, and that Swift could just as easily set up a clandestine coining operation in the backwoods of Virginia or aboard his ship. He also questions why Swift would take the time to produce such a detailed journal to cover his story.&lt;ref name=nickell&gt;{{cite web |last=Nickell |first=Joe |title=Uncovered - The Fabulous Silver Mines of Swift and Filson |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~vawise/SilverMine/Uncovered.html |accessdate=2007-08-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070714024754/http://www.rootsweb.com/~vawise/SilverMine/Uncovered.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tempting Heart''''' ({{zh|c=心動}}) is a 1999 [[film|movie]], directed and co-written by [[Sylvia Chang]], starring [[Takeshi Kaneshiro]] and [[Gigi Leung]] as a pair of onscreen lovers.

The film has a notable theme song "Xin Dong", performed by [[Shino Lin Xiao Pei]]. This song became a [[radio]] hit and can still be frequently heard on the radio or at [[karaoke]] bars/boxes.

The success of this film prompted director [[Johnnie To]] to cast Gigi Leung and Takeshi Kaneshiro again in his 2003 film ''[[Turn Left Turn Right]]''.

==Plot==

Sylvia Chang plays a director who intends to make a romance film and begins to wonder about the role fate plays in relationships. She ends up re-examining her own [[first love]] in a completely different light. The story is set in two different periods of time, one in the 1970s where Gigi plays the teenage Xiao-rou, and the other in the 1990s where Sylvia plays the older Xiao-rou.

Takeshi Kaneshiro plays the role of a shy teenager, Ho-jun, who falls in love with Xiao-rou (played by Gigi Leung). Their relationship turns intimate but faces fierce objections from their parents. [[Karen Mok]] plays Chen-li, Xiao-rou's best friend, whom Xiao-rou confides in.

This teenage love soon fizzles out owing to misunderstandings and Ho-jun, after many years, turns to marry Chen-li. One day, Chen-li reveals that she is a lesbian and that they both love the same girl - Xiao-rou.

Ho-jun meets Xiao-rou on a trip to [[Japan]] and upon knowing that Ho-jun is already married, Xiao-rou returns home and gets herself engaged. Ho-jun manages a last attempt to reunite with Xiao-rou by flying to Hong Kong and telling her that he is already a [[divorce]]e, but it is to no avail.

Years later, Xiao-rou finds out that Ho-jun's wife was actually Chen-li. She discovers this only after Chen-li has died. Chen-li leaves a message for Xiao-rou asking her for forgiveness. As Xiao rou prepares to fly back to Hong Kong from Japan, she receives a present from Ho-jun. In the box were photographs, taken when Ho-jun was thinking about Xiao-rou and of their brief moments of happiness.

It is only at the end of the film when it is tactfully revealed that the director Sylvia Chang was actually re-enacting her own teenage romance.

==Cast==
* [[Takeshi Kaneshiro]] - Ho-jun
* [[Gigi Leung]] - Sheo-rou (Xiao-rou)
* [[Karen Mok]] - Chen-Li

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7449">The project '''Text Database and Dictionary of Classic Mayan''' (abbr. TWKM) promotes research on the writing and language of pre-Hispanic [[Maya civilization|Maya culture]]. It is housed in the Faculty of Arts at the [[University of Bonn]] and was established with funding from the [[North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awk.nrw.de/forschung/forschungsvorhaben-im-akademienprogramm/textdatenbank-und-woerterbuch-des-klassischen-maya.html ''Project information on the website of the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts.''] Accessed on March 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The project has a projected run-time of fifteen years and is directed by [[Nikolai Grube]] from the Department of Anthropology of the Americas at the [[University of Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iae.uni-bonn.de/forschung/forschungsprojekte/laufende-projekte/idiom-dictionary-of-classic-mayan ''Project information on the website of the Department of Anthropology of the Americas, University of Bonn.''] Accessed on March 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the project is to conduct computer-based studies of all extant Maya hieroglyphic texts from an epigraphic and cultural-historical standpoint, and to produce and publish a database and a comprehensive dictionary of the [[Classic Maya language|Classic Mayan language]].

== Subject of the Project ==
The text database, as well as the dictionary that will be compiled by the conclusion of the project, will be assembled based on all known texts from the pre-Hispanic Maya culture. These texts were produced and used between approximately the third century B.C. through A.D. 1500, in a region that today includes parts of the countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. The thousands of hieroglyphic inscriptions on monuments, ceramics, or daily objects that have survived into the present offer insight into the language’s vocabulary and structure. The project’s database and dictionary will digitally represent original spellings using the [[Maya script|logo-syllabic Maya hieroglyphs]], as well as their transcription and transliteration in the Roman alphabet. The data will be additionally annotated with various epigraphic analyses, translations, and further object-specific information.

== Project Partners ==
TWKM will employ digital technologies in order to compile and make available the data and metadata, as well as to publish the project’s research results. The project thereby methodologically positions itself in the field of the [[digital humanities]]. The project will be conducted in cooperation with the project partners (below), the research association for the eHumanities [[TextGrid]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as well as the University and Regional Library of Bonn (ULB). The working environment that is currently under construction, in which the data and metadata will be compiled and annotated, will be realized in theTextGrid Laboratory, a software of the virtual research environment. A further component of this software, the TextGrid Repository, will make the data that are authorized for publication freely available online and ensure their long-term storage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.textgrid.de/en/about-textgrid/tools-services-ressources/ ''TextGrid Tools and Services''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127082810/http://www.textgrid.de/en/about-textgrid/tools-services-ressources |date=2015-01-27 }} Accessed on April 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The tools for data compilation and annotation attained from the modularly constructed and extended TextGrid lab thereby provide all the necessary materials for facilitating the research team’s the typical epigraphic workflow. The workflow usually begins by documenting the texts and the objects on which they are preserved, and by compiling descriptive data. It then continues with the various levels of epigraphic and linguistic analysis, and concludes in the best case scenario with a translation of the analyzed inscription and a corresponding publication. In cooperation with the ULB, selected data will additionally be made available. The project’s Virtual Inscription Archive will present online, in the Digital Collections of the ULB, hieroglyphic inscriptions selected from the published data in the repository, including an image of and brief information about the texts and the objects on which they are written, epigraphic analysis, and translation.

== Project Goal ==
One of the project’s goals is to produce a dictionary of Classic Mayan, in both digital and print form, towards the end of the project run-time. Additionally, a database with a corpus of inscriptions, including their translations and epigraphic analyses, will be made freely available online. The database furthermore will provide an ontology-like link of the contextual object data with the inscriptions and with each other, thereby allowing a cultural-historical arrangement of all contents within the periods of pre-Hispanic Maya culture. The contents of the database are additionally linked to citations of relevant literature. As a result, the database will also make freely available to both the scientific community and other interested parties a bibliography representing the research history and a base of knowledge concerning ancient Maya culture and script.
In addition, the Classic Maya script, in its temporally defined stages of language development, will be gathered into and documented in a comprehensive language corpus with the aid of the information gathered by the project. In collaboration with all project participants, the corpus data can be used, together with the aid of various comparable analyses and also computational linguistic methods, such as inference-based methods, to confirm readings of some hieroglyphs that are currently only partially confirmed, and to eventually completely decipher the [[Maya script|Classic Maya script]].

'''''The d'Artagnan Romances''''' are a set of three novels by [[Alexandre Dumas]] (1802–1870), telling the story of the 17th-century [[Musketeers of the Guard|musketeer]] [[Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan#Portrayals in fiction|d'Artagnan]].

Dumas based the character and attributes of d'Artagnan on captain of musketeers [[Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan]] (''c.'' 1611–1673) and the portrayal was particularly indebted to d'Artagnan's semi-fictionalized memoirs as written up 27 years after the hero's death by [[Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras]] (published 1700).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gatien de Sandras de Courtilz|title=Memoires de Mr. D'Artagnan, capitaine lieutenant de la premiere compagie des mousquetaires du roi : contenant quantité de choses, particuleres et secrettes qui se sont passées sous le regne de Louis le Grand.|date=1700|publisher=Chez Pierre Marteau|location=A Cologne|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/memoires-de-mr-dartagnan-capitaine-lieutenant-de-la-premiere-compagie-des-mousquetaires-du-roi-contenant-quantite-de-choses-particuleres-et-secrettes-qui-se-sont-passees-sous-le-regne-de-louis-le-grand/oclc/7785395&amp;referer=brief_results|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three novels are:
* ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', set between 1625 and 1628; first published in serial form in the magazine ''Le Siècle'' between March and July 1844. Dumas claims in the foreword to have based it on manuscripts he had discovered in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]].
* ''[[Twenty Years After]]'', set between 1648 and 1649; serialized from January to August, 1845.
* ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later]]'', set between 1660 and 1673; serialized from October 1847 to January 1850. This vast novel has been split into three, four, or five volumes at various points.
** In the three-volume edition, the novels are titled ''The Vicomte de Bragelonne'', ''Louise de la Vallière'' and ''The Man in the Iron Mask''.
** In the four-volume edition, the novels are titled ''The Vicomte de Bragelonne'', ''Ten Years Later'', ''Louise de la Vallière'' and ''The Man in the Iron Mask''.
** The five-volume edition generally does not give titles to the smaller portions.

Four further sequels to the D'Artagnan books – the novels ''[[The Son of Porthos]]'' (1883) and ''[[D'Artagnan Kingmaker]]'' (1900), ''[[The King’s Passport]]'' (1925), ''[[D'Artagnan, the sequel to the Three Musketeers]]'' – were written and published after Dumas's death. d'Artagnan does not appear in the first novel, which, although written by Paul Mahalin, was published under the pen name "Alexandre Dumas" and is still sold as such. The second novel was supposedly based on one of Dumas' plays. The last two were written by  [[H. Bedford-Jones]].

'''''Tung Shing''''' ({{zh|c=通勝}}) is a Chinese divination guide and almanac.  It consists primarily of a [[calendar]] based on the [[Chinese calendar|Chinese lunar year]].

==History==
''Tung Shing'' originated from ''Wong Lik'' (黃曆, the "Yellow Calendar"), which legend attributes to the [[Yellow Emperor]]. It has changed its form numerous times throughout the years during all the dynasties; the latest version was said to have been edited under the [[Qing dynasty]] and was called the '''''Tung Shu''''' (通書). ''Tung'' (通) means "all", ''Shu'' (書) means "book", so ''Tung Shu'' literally meant "All-knowing Book".  However, in [[Cantonese Chinese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese]], the pronunciation of the word for "book" is a homophone of a word for ''defeated'' (輸), so ''Tung Shu'' sounded like "Defeated in All Things" (通輸). Therefore, the name was changed to ''Tung Shing'' (通勝), which means "Victorious in All Things".&lt;ref&gt;Palmer 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Most of the contents of the book deals with what is suitable to do on each day.  Some Chinese families still follow these days for wedding ceremonies, funerals, etc.

''Tung Shing'' is also used by many [[fung shui]] practitioners and [[destiny]] [[diviners]] to complement other date selection methods for selecting dates and times for important events like marriages, official opening ceremonies, house moving-in and big contract signings, as well as smaller events like time to start renovations or travel.

The most common use of ''Tung Shing'' is in choosing a wedding date. ''Tung Shing'' contains information on the auspicious and inauspicious days for weddings and/or engagements. In addition, it provides the auspicious timing in which to carry out such activities.

''Tung Shing'' also provide a conversion of years and date between the lunar year and the common year. In more detailed versions, the calendar will list eclipses (both solar and lunar), the start of each season, and days when it will be cold or hot.  It also teaches ethics and values through stories.

''Tung Shing'' sold in [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]] are based on two late-Qing versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=梁玉芳 | title=全台最暢銷 農民曆年印600萬本 | url=http://udn.com/NEWS/NATIONAL/NAT3/4628948.shtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205010450/http://udn.com/NEWS/NATIONAL/NAT3/4628948.shtml | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2008-12-05 | publisher=聯合報 | date=2008-12-04 | accessdate=2008-12-04 | df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=梁玉芳 | title=院士黃一農：古人賣黃曆像麥當勞 | url=http://udn.com/NEWS/NATIONAL/NAT3/4628954.shtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205010456/http://udn.com/NEWS/NATIONAL/NAT3/4628954.shtml | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2008-12-05 | publisher=聯合報 | date=2008-12-04 | accessdate=2008-12-04 | df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; It{{clarify|date=October 2011}} is known for its English definitions and words transliterated into Cantonese characters.

{{about|vital statistics in relation to government records||vital statistics (disambiguation)}}

'''Vital statistics''' are statistics on live births, deaths, fetal deaths, marriages and divorces. The most common way of collecting information on these events is through [[Civil registry|civil registration]], an administrative system used by governments to record vital events which occur in their populations. Efforts to improve the quality of vital statistics will therefore be closely related to the development of civil registration systems in countries.

==Overview==
A vital statistics system is defined by the United Nations "as the total process of (a) collecting information by civil registration or enumeration on the frequency or occurrence of specified and defined vital events, as well as relevant characteristics of the events themselves and the person or persons concerned, and (b) compiling, processing, analyzing, evaluating, presenting, and disseminating these data in statistical form" (UN, 2001). Civil registration, as defined by the United Nations, is the" continuous, permanent, compulsory, and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events (livebirths, deaths, fetal deaths, marriages, and divorces) and other civil status events pertaining to the population as provided by decree, law or regulation, in accordance with the legal requirements in each country."

The origin of vital statistics begins as early as 1854 with [[James Stark (statistician)|James Stark]] in Register House in [[Edinburgh]] in reaction to the Scottish Registration Act&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Registration Act 1854&lt;/ref&gt; and death by social class was recorded in England beginning in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Caselli G. Health Transition and Cause-specific Mortality. In: Schofield R, Reher D, Bideau A, editors. The Decline of Mortality in Europe. Oxford: Clarendon Press; 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of births and deaths can be obtained by enumeration at certain points in time (e.g. censuses and surveys), civil registration collects this information on a continuous basis and is the only source that provides individuals with a legal document. For instance, the importance of birth registration as the first legal recognition of the child is emphasized in Article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which states that "the child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents". [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) and a number of non-governmental organizations (Plan International, Save the Children Fund, World Vision, etc.) have particularly promoted the human rights aspects of registration, while the [[United Nations Statistics Division]] (UNSD), [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) have focused more on the statistical aspects of civil registration.

Countries which are signatories to the Convention on the Rights of the Child are therefore expected to set up systems to register the births of all children. Non-registration of a child can have negative consequences on the wider enjoyment of a child’s fundamental rights to benefits such as identity, inheritance, education, health and other social services. Birth registration is also part of a broader strategy to ensure that children are less vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, especially if separated from their parents. In the absence of a functioning birth registration system, it is difficult to see how a country can enforce age-related legal concerns such as schooling, child labour, juvenile justice, early marriage, sexual exploitation and military recruitment. Recent natural disasters and calamities have also demonstrated the utility of a birth certificate for reuniting lost children with their families.

Many civil registration systems also collect information on causes of death. Statistics based on these death records are of particular importance in public health for identifying the magnitude and distribution of major disease problems, and are essential for the design, implementation, monitoring, and assessment of health programmes and policies.

Toronto scientist, professor Prabhat Jha argues that inexpensive recording of vital statistics in developing countries is the most effective means to improve global health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pagliaro|first=Jennifer|title=How Toronto-based epidemiologist Prabhat Jha is counting the dead to save the living|url=https://www.thestar.com/living/article/1152928--how-toronto-based-epidemiologist-prabhat-jha-is-counting-the-dead-to-save-the-living|accessdate=29 August 2012|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and has outlined 5 options for expanding Cause of Death reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5779/hypothesis.v10i1.254 |title=Counting the dead is one of the world's best investments to reduce premature mortality |journal=Hypothesis |volume=10 |year=2012 |last1=Jha |first1=Prabhat }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Despite the importance of tracking causes of death and the tradition since 1893 of standardisation of definitions and coding for causes of death in the International Classification of Diseases and Injuries (ICD), global assessments of causes of death are a major analytical challenge. Vital registration systems that include medical certification of the cause of death captured about 18.8 million deaths of an estimated annual total of 51.7 million deaths in 2005, which is the latest year for which the largest number of countries reported deaths from a vital registration system. Even for these deaths, the comparability of findings on the leading causes of death is affected by variation in certification skills among physicians, the diagnostic and pathological data available at the time of completing a death certificate, variations in medical culture in choosing the underlying cause, and legal and institutional frameworks for governing mortality reporting. For the remaining deaths that are not medically certified, many different data sources and diagnostic approaches must be used from surveillance systems, demographic research sites, surveys, censuses, disease registries, and police records to construct a consolidated picture of causes of death in various populations. Because of the variety of data sources and their associated biases, causes of death assessments are inherently uncertain and subject to vigorous debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0 |pmid=23245604 |title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 |journal=The Lancet |volume=380 |issue=9859 |pages=2095–2128 |year=2012 |last1=Lozano |first1=Rafael |last2=Naghavi |first2=Mohsen |last3=Foreman |first3=Kyle |last4=Lim |first4=Stephen |last5=Shibuya |first5=Kenji |last6=Aboyans |first6=Victor |last7=Abraham |first7=Jerry |last8=Adair |first8=Timothy |last9=Aggarwal |first9=Rakesh |last10=Ahn |first10=Stephanie Y. |last11=Almazroa |first11=Mohammad A. |last12=Alvarado |first12=Miriam |last13=Anderson |first13=H Ross |last14=Anderson |first14=Laurie M. |last15=Andrews |first15=Kathryn G. |last16=Atkinson |first16=Charles |last17=Baddour |first17=Larry M. |last18=Barker-Collo |first18=Suzanne |last19=Bartels |first19=David H. |last20=Bell |first20=Michelle L. |last21=Benjamin |first21=Emelia J. |last22=Bennett |first22=Derrick |last23=Bhalla |first23=Kavi |last24=Bikbov |first24=Boris |last25=Abdulhak |first25=Aref Bin |last26=Birbeck |first26=Gretchen |last27=Blyth |first27=Fiona |last28=Bolliger |first28=Ian |last29=Boufous |first29=Soufiane |last30=Bucello |first30=Chiara |displayauthors=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Warhammer 40,000 Apocalypse''' is an expansion to the [[Warhammer 40,000]] tabletop miniatures wargame by the British gaming company [[Games Workshop]].&lt;ref name="Apoc1st"&gt;{{cite book|title=Warhammer 40,000: Apocalypse|first=|last=|author2=|date=October 2007|edition=1st|publisher=Games Workshop|location=Nottingham|isbn=1-84154-838-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains rules which allow players to field massive armies the likes of which are unwieldy using the basic Warhammer 40,000 ruleset. It also allows players to field units that are not available in normal Warhammer 40,000 games, such as large [[super-heavy tank]]s and robot-like [[Titan (Warhammer 40,000)|titan]]s, some of which can stand up to 400 feet in height.

The first print of the Apocalypse sourcebook was released in October 2007, during the latter days of Warhammer 40,000's fourth edition.&lt;ref name="VFT20070711"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://viewfromtheturret.com/2007/07/11/warhammer-40k-apocalypse/|title=Warhammer 40K — Apocalypse|first=tanker |date=2007-07-11|work=News and Updates|publisher= The View from the Turret: the best of wargaming and military history|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GR20071016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamingreport.com/article.php?sid=24353|title=Warhammer 40k: Apocalypse released|first=JoyceGreenholdt|date=2007-10-16|work=News|publisher=GamingReport.com: Where Gamers get their News|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TTN20071011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tabletopgamingnews.com/2007/10/11/10408|title=GW US new releases|last=Belado|first=Zac|date=2007-10-11|publisher=Tabletop Gaming News|accessdate=2009-02-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of the fifth edition of Warhammer 40,000 in 2008 prompted Games Workshop to start working on an update to the Apocalypse ruleset in order to streamline its compatibility with the new edition. This update culminated in the announcement of ''Warhammer 40,000: Apocalypse Reload'', an all-new 88-page edition of the Apocalypse rulebook.&lt;ref name="Apoc5thed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/content/article.jsp?community=&amp;catId=cat1090001&amp;categoryId=900006&amp;aId=6900009|title=Harbinger of the Apocalypse|last=Troke|first=Adam|year=2009|work=Apocalypse in the new edition of Warhammer 40,000|publisher=Games Workshop|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newest edition was released in July 2013, along with new models, templates and scenery pieces. It has 296 pages of full color as well as updated rules for the game.

Along with the official sourcebooks themselves, Games Workshop and its subsidiary [[Forge World]] has released supplementary material and model kits that can only be used with the Apocalypse ruleset. Most notable of which was the plastic [[Baneblade]] super-heavy tank boxed set released by Games Workshop at the same time as the Apocalypse rulebook. At the time, the Baneblade was the largest plastic kit that the company produced; Prior to that time, all large Warhammer 40,000 tanks were produced only in [[resin]] by Forge World. The Baneblade was also the first Warhammer 40,000 model kit created by Games Workshop that could only be used with an optional expansion and not within the base Warhammer 40,000 game.&lt;ref name="WD333"&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 2007|title=Apocalypse Design Notes|publisher=Games Workshop|location=Nottingham, UK|issue=333|pages=40–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stompa was released along with the first edition, an Ork model of a ramshackle metal giant with multiple weapons around its belly and arms. In the newest edition, the Necron Tesseract and the Khorne Lord of Skulls were released as the super heavy models during Apocalypse games. Along with the Baneblade and the Stompa, they are the only models built around Apocalypse that are not produced by Forge World. The Necron Tesseract is a prison containing a god-like being, releasing massive amounts of lethal energy around the battlefield. The Khorne Lord of Skulls is a Chaos tank fused with cannons and a chainsaw of a metal knight-like body.

Like many other miniature wargames, Warhammer 40,000 relies on a point-based system to ensure a balanced game between players. Players set a maximum amount of pointage that they will construct their armies with. No matter what faction a player uses, each unit has a corresponding point cost, with generally powerful units costing much more than standard soldiers.

Games Workshop released Apocalypse formations, which are essentially dozens of miniature to play an Apocalypse game, in July 2013. They are often the quickest way to build an Apocalyptic army.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==History==
In 2004, two million copies of the first edition of ''Xiandai Hanyu Guifan Cidian'' were printed.&lt;ref name="weibo"/&gt; In March 2004, Jiang Lansheng and other twelve members of the 1st Plenary Session of the 10th [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|CPPCC]] National Committee submitted a proposal titled 《辞书应慎用“规范”冠名》 (Literally: Dictionaries Ought to Use the Word "Standard" ("Guifan") in their Titles More Prudently). The document stated that ''Xiandai Hanyu Cidian'' was in full compliance with the nation's linguistic standards and questioned the naming of and the overall editorial quality of ''Xiandai Hanyu Guifan Cidian''. Some of the argumentation was derived from the book 《拯救辞书——规范辨正、质量管窥及学术道德考量》.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty years - A Dictionary of Current Chinese'' ({{zh |s= 《现代汉语词典》五十年}}) .{{ISBN|7100042178}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|205}}

The second edition of the dictionary, published in 2010, includes 70,000 entries and 80,000 example usages. Among the new words and 2,600 new definitions added in the second edition included {{linktext|lang=zh-hans|微博}} ([[Microblogging in China|Weibo]]), {{linktext|lang=zh-hans|低碳经济}}&lt;ref name="2nd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=|first1= |script-title={{lang|zh-hans|现代汉语规范词典(第2版).}} |trans-title=A Standard Dictionary of Current Chinese (Second Edition). |date=March 2010|publisher=外语教学与研究出版社. Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press.|isbn=978-7-5600-9518-9|page=|location=北京. [[Beijing]]|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|283}} ([[Low-carbon economy]]), and {{linktext|lang=zh-hans|减排}}&lt;ref name="2nd"/&gt;{{rp|641}} (reduce discharge of pollution).&lt;ref name="weibo"/&gt;

The third edition of ''Xiandai Hanyu Guifan Cidian'' was the first dictionary to be written according to the standard of the ''[[Table of General Standard Chinese Characters]]''.&lt;ref name="tuhao"/&gt; New entries included in the {{lang|zh-hans|补编（二）复音条目}} (Additions Part 2: Multi-syllable Entries) section of the third edition include {{linktext|lang=zh-hans|微信}}&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt;{{rp|1796}} ([[WeChat]]), {{linktext|lang=zh-hans|吐槽}}&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt;{{rp|1796}} (whine), {{linktext|lang=zh-hans|失联}}&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt;{{rp|1794}} (lose contact), {{linktext|lang=zh-hans|拍砖}}&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt;{{rp|1792}} (criticize),   {{linktext|lang=zh-hans|正能量}}&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt;{{rp|1799}} (positivity) {{linktext|lang=zh-hans|接地气}}&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt;{{rp|1788}} (down-to-earth), {{linktext|lang=zh-hans|细颗粒物}}&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt;{{rp|1797}} (particulate matter 2.5) and others.&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt;{{rp|back cover}}&lt;ref name="tuhao"/&gt; The third edition added new definitions for some words. For example, '{{linktext|lang=zh-hans|土豪}}' was newly defined as '[[new rich]]'.&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt;{{rp|1329}}&lt;ref name="tuhao"/&gt; In the {{lang|zh-hans|补编（一）单字条目}} (Additions Part 1: Single Character Entries) section of the dictionary, new entries for four hundred characters from the ''Table of General Standard Chinese Characters'' were added, including entries for {{linktext|lang=zh-hans|鲿}}&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt;{{rp|1772}}&lt;ref name="tygfhzb"&gt;{{cite web | title = 通用规范汉字表 |trans-title=Table of General Standard Chinese Characters | publisher = Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China | date = 18 Jun 2013 | url = http://www.gov.cn/gzdt/att/att/site1/20130819/tygfhzb.pdf | accessdate=17 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} ([[codfish]]) and {{linktext|lang=zh-hans|玃}}&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt;{{rp|1775}}&lt;ref name="tygfhzb"/&gt;{{rp|47}} (a literary term for monkeys).&lt;ref name="tuhao"/&gt; The third edition has entries for 12,000 characters and 72,000 words, with over 80,000 example usages.&lt;ref name="tuhao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2014-08-27/075730749859.shtml?qq-pf-to=pcqq.discussion |script-title=现代汉语规范词典为土豪定义：有钱没文化的人 |language=Simplified Chinese|quote=|date=27 August 2014 |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
