The first Zika outbreak started in French Polynesia in October 2013, with cases reported in the [[Society Islands|Society]], [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]] and [[Tuamotu Islands]] on [[Tahiti]], [[Mo'orea]], [[Raiatea]], [[Tahaa]], [[Bora Bora]], [[Nuku Hiva]] and [[Arutua]].&lt;ref name=berger/&gt;&lt;ref name="promedmail1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mallet|first1=Dr. Henri-Pierre|title=ZIKA VIRUS - FRENCH POLYNESIA|url=http://www.promedmail.org/post/20131106.2041959|website=[[ProMED-mail]]|publisher=[[International Society for Infectious Diseases]]|accessdate=7 February 2016|location=[[Papeete]]|date=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak ran concurrently with an outbreak of [[dengue fever]].&lt;ref name=eurosurveillance1/&gt;&lt;ref name="ecdc1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Communicable Disease Threats Report|url=http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-01-mar-2014.pdf|date=1 March 2014|publisher=[[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]]|location=Stockholm|accessdate=7 February 2016|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, an [[Americans|American]] traveler to Mo'orea was diagnosed with Zika virus infection in [[New York City|New York]] after an 11-day history of symptoms,&lt;ref name="jtm1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Summers|first1=Dr. Dyan J.|last2=Acosta|first2=Dr. Rebecca Wolfe|last3=Acosta|first3=Dr. Alberto M.|title=Zika Virus in an American Recreational Traveler|journal=[[International Society of Travel Medicine#The Journal of Travel Medicine|Journal of Travel Medicine]]|date=21 May 2015|publisher=[[International Society of Travel Medicine]]|volume=22|issue=5|pages=338–340|doi=10.1111/jtm.12208|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jtm.12208/full|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first American tourist to be diagnosed with Zika.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican1"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Maron |first=Dina Fine |date=8 October 2015 |title=Zika Disease: Another Reason to Hate Mosquitoes |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/zika-disease-another-reason-to-hate-mosquitoes/ |magazine=[[Scientific American]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |accessdate=21 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Japanese people|Japanese]] tourist returning to [[Japan]] was also diagnosed with Zika virus infection by the [[National Institute of Infectious Diseases]] after visiting Bora Bora, becoming the first imported case of Zika fever in Japan.&lt;ref name="promedmail2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kutsuna|first1=Dr. Satoshi|title=ZIKA VIRUS - JAPAN: ex FRENCH POLYNESIA|url=http://www.promedmail.org/post/20131219.2126046|website=[[ProMED-mail]]|publisher=[[International Society for Infectious Diseases]]|accessdate=7 February 2016|location=Toyama|date=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Japanese cases}} By February 2014, it was estimated that more than 29,000 people with Zika-like symptoms had sought medical care, roughly 11.5% of the population,&lt;ref name=eurosurveillance2/&gt; with 8,503 suspected cases.&lt;ref name=ecdc1/&gt; Of 746 samples tested at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Institut Louis-Malardé|fr}} in Tahiti by 7 February, 396 (53.1%) were confirmed as containing the Zika virus by [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|RT-PCR]].

By March 2014, the outbreak was declining in the majority of the islands,&lt;ref name=ecdc1/&gt; and by October the outbreak had abated. A total of 8,723 suspected cases of Zika virus infection were reported, as well as more than 30,000 estimated clinical visits and medical consultations due to concerns about Zika.&lt;ref name=eurosurveillance1/&gt; The true number of Zika cases was estimated at more than 30,000.&lt;ref name="berger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Stephen|date=3 February 2015|title=Chikungunya and Zika: Global Status|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZPZ9BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75|publisher=[[Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network|GIDEON Informatics, Inc.]]|edition=2015|page=75|isbn=9781498806978|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Caledonia ===
Zika spread westwards from French Polynesia to [[New Caledonia]], where imported cases from French Polynesia were reported from November 2013 onwards. The first indigenous case was confirmed in January 2014 by the [[Pasteur Institute]].&lt;ref name=eurosurveillance1/&gt;&lt;ref name="promedmail3"&gt;{{cite web|title=ZIKA VIRUS - PACIFIC (03): NEW CALEDONIA|url=http://www.promedmail.org/post/20140122.2224823|website=[[ProMED-mail]]|publisher=[[International Society for Infectious Diseases]]|accessdate=7 February 2016|date=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February, there were 64 reported cases of Zika in the communities of Greater [[Nouméa]], [[Dumbéa]], and [[Ouvéa]], of which 30 were imported from French Polynesia. By 26 February 2014, there were 140 confirmed cases of Zika in New Caledonia, including 32 imported cases.&lt;ref name=ecdc1/&gt; The outbreak peaked in April, and by 17 September, the number of confirmed cases had gone up to 1,400, of which 35 were imported. During the same time period, there were also outbreaks of [[Chikungunya|chikungunya fever]] and dengue fever.&lt;ref name=eurosurveillance1/&gt;

=== Cook Islands ===
In February 2014, an outbreak of Zika was reported in the [[Cook Islands]], to the southwest of French Polynesia.&lt;ref name=eurosurveillance1/&gt; In March, an [[Australian people|Australian]] woman was diagnosed with a Zika virus infection by [[Queensland Health]] following a recent trip to the Cook Islands, becoming the second reported case of Zika diagnosed in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=plos1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyke|first1=AT|last2=Daly|first2=MT|last3=Cameron|first3=JN|last4=Moore|first4=PR|last5=Taylor|first5=CT|last6=Hewitson|first6=GR|last7=Humphreys|first7=JL|last8=Gair|first8=R|title=Imported Zika Virus Infection from the Cook Islands into Australia, 2014|journal=[[PLOS]] Currents: Outbreaks|url=http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/imported-zika-virus-infection-from-the-cook-islands-into-australia-2014/|date=2 June 2014|edition=1st|volume=6|pmid=24944843|pmc=4055592|doi=10.1371/currents.outbreaks.4635a54dbffba2156fb2fd76dc49f65e|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 40 other cases of Zika virus infection were imported into [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="nz1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dengue Fever, Zika and Chikungunya|url=http://www.arphs.govt.nz/health-information/communicable-disease/dengue-fever-zika-chikungunya#.Vr3tJbKLTIU|publisher=Auckland Regional [[District health board|Public Health Service]]|accessdate=12 February 2016|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 29 May, the outbreak had ended, with 50 confirmed and 932 suspected cases of Zika virus infection.&lt;ref name=eurosurveillance1/&gt;

=== Easter Island ===
By March 2014, there were one confirmed and 40 suspected cases of Zika virus infection on [[Easter Island]]. The Zika virus was suspected to have been carried to the island by a tourist from French Polynesia during the annual [[Easter Island#21st-century culture|Tapati festival]], held between January and February.&lt;ref name=eid1/&gt; [[Chile]]an health authorities decided against issuing a health alert, saying that the outbreak had been contained and was under control, and advised travelers to take precautions against mosquito bites.&lt;ref name="healthmap1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwan|first1=Katharina|title=First Case of Zika Virus reported on Easter Island|url=http://www.healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/first-case-zika-virus-reported-easter-island-3714|accessdate=8 February 2016|work=The Disease Daily|publisher=[[HealthMap]]|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, 173 cases of Zika had been reported, but all of the cases were described as "mild".&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esposito|first1=Anthony|title=Mainland Chile confirms first three cases of Zika virus|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-chile-idUSKCN0VB29K|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=3 February 2016|location=Santiago|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2014, a [[Belgians|Belgian]] woman flying to Easter Island from Tahiti was diagnosed with Zika virus infection after having previously received [[ambulatory care]] in Tahiti, and was taken to [[Hanga Roa]] Hospital for evaluation. [[LAN Airlines]] undertook operations to ensure other people on the woman's flight were not infected, and local health authorities stated that Zika was not a risk for people on the island.&lt;ref name="promedmail4"&gt;{{cite web|title=ZIKA VIRUS - PACIFIC (15): CHILE (EASTER ISLAND) ex TAHITI|url=http://www.promedmail.org/post/20140925.2804821|website=[[ProMED-mail]]|publisher=[[International Society for Infectious Diseases]]|accessdate=7 February 2016|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transmission==
{{see also|Zika virus#Transmission}}
[[File:Aedes aegypti.jpg|thumb|Adult ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' mosquito, a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] or carrier of the Zika virus ]]
Zika is a [[mosquito-borne disease]]. Four [[Aedes|aedine]] species of [[mosquito]] are found in the [[Pacific Islands|Pacific]], including ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'', widespread across the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], and ''[[Aedes polynesiensis]]'', found between [[Fiji]] and French Polynesia. ''Aedes aegypti'' has previous been identified as a wild [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] of the Zika virus, and preliminary results from the Institut Louis-Malardé have supported the main role of ''Aedes aegypti'' and probable role of ''Aedes polynesiensis'' in spreading the Zika virus.&lt;ref name=ecdc3/&gt;

People infected with the Zika virus traveling to other Pacific islands could transmit the disease to local mosquitoes that bit them. The infected mosquitoes could then go on to spread Zika among the local mosquito population, and thence cause outbreaks of Zika among local people.&lt;ref name="au1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Where the mosquito-borne Zika virus is spreading|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/where-the-mosquitoborne-zika-virus-is-spreading/news-story/d03ee4f91b3f8d3059215dbe8e91f38e|accessdate=12 February 2016|work=[[News.com.au]]|agency=[[Reuters]], [[News Corp Australia]]|date=26 January 2016|quote=Somebody would travel to say Brazil, get Zika virus there and come back to Cairns, or a South American traveller who’s visiting Australia is infected with Zika virus.

But Vasilakis says a previously infected human visitor could have been bitten by local mosquitoes, which then spread the virus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted between November 2013 and February 2014 in French Polynesia found that 2.8% of [[blood donation|blood donors]] tested positive for the Zika virus, of which 3% were asymptomatic at the time of blood donation. 11 of the infected donors studied subsequently reported symptoms of Zika virus infection within 10 days.&lt;ref name=eurosurveillance2/&gt; This indicated a potential risk of transmission of the Zika virus through [[blood transfusion]]s, but there are no confirmed cases of this occurring.&lt;ref name=ecdc4/&gt; [[Nucleic acid test]]ing of blood donors was implemented in French Polynesia from 13 January 2014 onwards to prevent unintended transmission of the Zika virus.&lt;ref name="eurosurveillance2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Musso|first1=D|last2=Nhan|first2=T|last3=Robin|first3=E|last4=Roche|first4=C|last5=Bierlaire|first5=D|last6=Zisou|first6=K|last7=Shan Yan|first7=A|last8=Cao-Lormeau|first8=VM|last9=Broult|first9=J|title=Potential for Zika virus transmission through blood transfusion demonstrated during an outbreak in French Polynesia, November 2013 to February 2014|url=http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20761|journal=[[Eurosurveillance]]|date=10 April 2014|volume=19|issue=14|pmid=24739982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A concurrent increase in [[Neurological disorder|neurological syndromes]] and [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] complications was first reported in early 2014.&lt;ref name=eurosurveillance1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ecdc1/&gt; Of the 8,723 cases of Zika reported in French Polynesia, complications related to neurological signs of infection were noted in 74 people, including [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] (GBS) in 42 people, as well as [[encephalitis]], [[meningoencephalitis]], [[paraesthesia]], [[facial nerve paralysis|facial paralysis]] or [[myelitis]] in 25.&lt;ref name="ecdc2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microcephaly in Brazil potentially linked to the Zika virus epidemic|url=http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/zika-microcephaly-Brazil-rapid-risk-assessment-Nov-2015.pdf|date=24 November 2015|publisher=[[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]]|location=Stockholm|accessdate=8 February 2016|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was only one laboratory confirmation of Zika virus infection using RT-PCR in patients with GBS. Among the initial 38 cases of GBS found in suspected Zika cases, 73% were male and infected individuals were aged between 27 and 70. This was highly unusual, as prior to the Zika outbreak there had only been 21 cases of GBS in French Polynesia between 2009 and 2012. 18 people newly diagnosed with GBS were admitted to the local [[Guillain–Barré syndrome#Rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] centre, putting heavy strain on the limited [[intensive care]] resources available.&lt;ref name=ecdc3/&gt;

On 24 November 2015, health authorities in French Polynesia reported that there had been an unusual increase in the number of cases of [[central nervous system]] [[congenital disorder|malformations in fetuses and infants]] during 2014–2015, coinciding with the outbreak of Zika on the islands. These malformations included 12 with fetal [[cerebrum|cerebral]] malformations or polymalformative syndromes, which includes [[microcephaly]],&lt;ref name=microcephaly/&gt; and another 5 with [[brainstem]] dysfunction and absence of [[swallowing]], much greater than the annual average of one case. None of the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women involved had [[medical signs]] of Zika virus infection, but four who were tested gave positive results in [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] [[serology]] [[assay]]s for [[flavivirus]]es, suggesting an [[asymptomatic]] Zika virus infection during pregnancy. French Polynesian health authorities [[hypothesis]]e that these abnormalities are associated with Zika if pregnant women are infected during the first or second [[Pregnancy#Physiology|trimester]] of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=ecdc2/&gt; Dr. Didier Musso, an [[infectious disease]] specialist at the Institut Louis-Malardé, said that there was "very high suspicion" of a link between microcephaly and the Zika virus outbreak in French Polynesia, but added that further research was still needed.&lt;ref name="microcephaly"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNeil Jr.|first1=Donald G|last2=Saint Louis|first2=Catherine|last3=St. Fleur|first3=Nicholas|title=Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/health/what-is-zika-virus.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 February 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 February 2016|quote=There is “very high suspicion” of a link between the Zika virus and microcephaly in French Polynesia, said Dr. Didier Musso, an infectious disease specialist at the archipelago’s Institut Louis Malardé – though he said additional research was still needed. Last November French Polynesian officials reinvestigated an outbreak of Zika that lasted from October 2013 to April 2014. They reported finding an unusual increase – from around one case annually to 17 cases in 2014-15 – of unborn babies developing “central nervous system malformations,” a classification that includes microcephaly.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[#Japanese cases|The two cases of Zika virus infection imported into Japan from French Polynesia in February 2014]] showed signs of [[leukopenia]] (decreased levels of [[white blood cell]]s) and moderate [[thrombocytopenia]] (decreased levels of [[platelet]]s).&lt;ref name=ecdc3/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{details|topic=the ongoing Zika virus epidemic|2015–16 Zika virus epidemic}}
Brazilian researchers have suggested that a traveler infected with the Zika virus arrived in [[Brazil]] from French Polynesia, leading to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak that began in 2015. This may have occurred during the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] tournament,&lt;ref name=Romero29Jan&gt;{{cite news|last=Romero|first=Simon|date=29 January 2016|title=Tears and Bewilderment in Brazilian City Facing Zika Crisis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/world/americas/tears-and-bewilderment-in-brazilian-city-facing-zika-crisis.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or shortly after, based on [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] DNA analysis of the virus. French researchers have speculated that the virus arrived in August 2014, when canoeing teams from French Polynesia, New Caledonia, the Cook Islands and Easter Island attended the [[Va'a]] World Sprint Championships in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name=eid1/&gt;&lt;ref name=McNeil6Feb&gt;{{cite news|first1=Donald G.|last1=McNeil, Jr.|first2=Simon|last2=Romero|first3=Sabrina|last3=Tavernise|date=6 February 2016|title=How a Medical Mystery in Brazil Led Doctors to Zika|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/health/zika-virus-brazil-how-it-spread-explained.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Murthy28Jan&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[ABC News]]|title=Zika Virus Outbreak May Be Linked to Major Sporting Events|url= http://abcnews.go.com/Health/zika-virus-outbreak-brazil-linked-major-sporting-events/story?id=36575321|first=Dr. Bhavini|last=Murthy|date=January 28, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1 January and 20 May 2015, a further 82 confirmed cases of Zika were reported in New Caledonia, including ten imported cases.&lt;ref name=ecdc4/&gt;

In early 2015, two cases of Zika virus infection were reported in travelers returning to [[Italy]] from French Polynesia.&lt;ref name=berger/&gt;

In February 2015, an outbreak of Zika began in the [[Solomon Islands]]. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services reported the first laboratory confirmation of Zika virus infection on 12 March 2015, and by 3 May 302 cases of Zika had been reported, with the number of new cases steadily decreasing.&lt;ref name="ecdc4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zika virus infection outbreak, Brazil and the Pacific region|url=http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-Zika%20virus-south-america-Brazil-2015.pdf|date=25 May 2015|publisher=[[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]]|location=Stockholm|accessdate=12 February 2016|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 2015, the Ministry of Health of [[Vanuatu]] announced that blood samples collected prior to [[Cyclone Pam]] in March were confirmed to contain the Zika virus. The Ministry of Health advised people to consult medical aid if they experienced a high fever with no obvious cause, and recommended communities [[Mosquito control#Source reduction|clean up places where mosquitoes could lay eggs]].&lt;ref name="vu1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Willie|first1=Glenda|title=Zika and dengue cases confirmed|url=http://dailypost.vu/news/article_a63846c6-315d-5e8d-b5ad-3d57eaf4a386.html|accessdate=12 February 2016|work=[[Vanuatu Daily Post]]|date=27 April 2015|location=Port Vila}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the Zika virus was thought to be linked to frequent travel between New Caledonia and Vanuatu.&lt;ref name=eid1/&gt;

__NOTOC__
{{italic title}}
An '''''Angerdorf''''' (plural: ''Angerdörfer'') is a type of [[village]] that is characterised by the houses and farmsteads being laid out around a central grassed area, the ''[[Anger (meadow)|anger]]'' (from the [[Old High German]] ''angar'' =pasture or grassy place),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.at/books?id=DZwgAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;&amp;dq=Anger  Deutsches Wörterbuch, von Friedrich L. Weigand, 1968] at books.google.at&lt;/ref&gt; a [[village green]] which was [[common land]], owned jointly by the village community. The ''anger'' is usually in the shape of a [[lens (optics)|lens]] or an eye, but may also take other forms: a rectangle, triangle, circle or semi-circle (illustrated). The buildings are oriented with their eaves facing the road. Livestock stalls and barns are at the rear of the plot (in Austria called the ''[[Hintaus]]'') and may be linked by a farm track that runs around the village forming an outer ring.

There is often a village pond on the ''anger'' and sometimes a stream flows through it which may not be easy to recognise today where the [[groundwater]] level has changed. The waterbody may well be the reason the ''anger'' was chosen. Originally there were no buildings on the ''anger'', but in the course of time other community facilities were often built on it, such as the village church, [[village school]] or a [[forge|smithy]].

''Angerdörfer'' occur in Central Europe, especially on [[ground moraine]] plates and in [[loess]]-covered terrain. In [[Germany]] they are common in East Germany and east Central Germany. They were often established during the period of German [[Ostkolonisation]] in the [[Middle Ages]] and in many western [[Hungary|Hungarian]] villages (for example in Burgenland's [[Loretto (Burgenland)|Loretto]], formerly in Hungary, with the largest ''anger'' in Europe) the original layout has survived.

In [[Austria]] this type of village occurs predominantly in the [[Waldviertel]] and [[Weinviertel]] provinces of [[Lower Austria]], in the [[Vienna Basin]], in [[Burgenland]] and in east and south [[Styria (state)|Styria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austria-lexikon.at/ebook/wbin/ambrosius.html#thumbview=2p&amp;pageid=00000242&amp;layer=default1&amp;pagenum=245&amp;book=Lexika/Oesterreich_Lexikon_Band1 Dorf] im Österreich-Lexikon&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also ''Angerdörfer'' in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] in the vicinity of the Franco-German language boundary (e. g. [[Sommerviller]]) and in North England (e. g. [[Maulds Meaburn]]).

==Early life==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Bandi Rajan Babu was born at [[Koratla|Korutla]], in the [[Karimnagar district]] ([[Jagtial district]]) of the Indian state of [[Telangana]]. 

== Early life ==
Rajan took to serious photography in 1960 after joining the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad|Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University]].

Rajan Babu was all set to become a painter until given a [[Kodak camera]]. “One of my cousins presented me with a camera when I was in my seventh class and I casually clicked some photos that were appreciated by all, and that was the seeding of a photographer in me. Later, when I joined the five-year diploma course in commercial art, I came across Raja Triambak Raj Bahadur, a pioneer in pictorial photography. It was he who inspired me to wield the camera. And here I am today from a painter to a photographer."

== Career ==
He started as a lecturer at [[Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University|JNTU Fine Arts College]]. Later, he established his own school and mastered the craft of ‘pictorial photography'. He was a Fellow of the [[Royal Photographic Society]] of [[Great Britain]], an Associate of the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Art Photographique|International Federation of Photographic Art]], [[France]], and an Honorary Fellow of the AP State Akademi of Photography.

He became a pictorial, fashion and glamour, industrial and advertising photographer.  He drew inspiration from Raja Triambak Raj Bahadur, the first from former [[Andhra Pradesh]] to be honored with the status of Associate of Britain's Royal Photographic Society. 

He later worked as a scientific photographer in International Crop Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics. 

He opened his studio in 1978 and thereafter, was among India's leading photographers.{{according to whom|date=October 2018}} 

== Personal life ==
He married and had three kids. He has five grand children.

==Recognition==
Rajan got his first international honor from [[Belgium]], received the APRS honor in 1983, and followed it up with the Fellowship of the [[Royal Photographic Society]] in 1987. Apart from winning national and international awards, he is the only Fellow of Royal Photographic Society from AP.

Engel]] in 1977 for understanding health and illness. It has been criticized for lacking philosophical coherence and being undisciplined.

==History==
The biopsychosocial model was proposed by George L. Engel to better reflect the development of illness through the complex interaction of [[biology|biological factors]] (genetic, biochemical, ''etc''), [[psychology|psychological factors]] (mood, personality, behavior, etc.), and [[interpersonal relationship|social factors]] (cultural, familial, socioeconomic, medical, etc.).&lt;ref name=Engel977&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engel |first1=GL |title=The need for a new medical model: a challenge for biomedicine. |journal=Science |date=8 April 1977 |volume=196 |issue=4286 |pages=129–36 |pmid=847460}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Engel G. L. | year = 1980 | title = The clinical application of the biopsychosocial model | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 137 | issue = 5 | pages = 535–544 | doi=10.1176/ajp.137.5.535 | pmid=7369396}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=September 2018}}  The model provides a blueprint for research, a framework for teaching, and a design for action in the real world of health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engel |first1=George L. |title=The Need for a New Medical Model: A Challenge for Biomedicine |journal=Holistic Medicine |date=6 July 2009 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=37–53 |doi=10.3109/13561828909043606}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=September 2018}}

The proposal of the model was in reaction to the perceived lack of science being used in psychiatry at the time and the reductionist approach used in other medicine fields—neither of which were adequate for treating illness.&lt;ref name=Engel977/&gt;{{primary-inline|date=September 2018}} In developing the model, Engel noted that it needed to be equally applicable for illnesses, rather than being for either physical or psychological problems.  By considering both in the same terms, it became obvious that both the inclusion of somatic and psychosocial factors were indispensable and the exclusion of either would impact on patient care.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Criticisms==
There have been a number of criticisms of the biopsychosocial model. Benning summarised the arguments against the model including that it lacked philosophical coherence, was insensitive to patients' subjective experience, was unfaithful to the general systems theory that Engel claimed it be rooted in, and that it engendered an undisciplined eclecticism that provides no safeguards against either the dominance or the under-representation of any one of the three domains of bio, psycho, or social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benning |first1=TB |title=Limitations of the biopsychosocial model in psychiatry. |journal=Advances in Medical Education and Practice |date=2015 |volume=6 |pages=347–52 |doi=10.2147/AMEP.S82937 |pmid=25999775 |pmc=4427076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that the approach borders on anarchy because of the suggestion that the target and focus on intervention is determined by the practitioner based on personal preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ghaemi |first1=SN |title=The rise and fall of the biopsychosocial model. |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |date=July 2009 |volume=195 |issue=1 |pages=3–4 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.109.063859 |pmid=19567886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, some became reductionistic about the model itself, attempting to predict small parts of one aspect to predict the functioning in one field of medicine, for example psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McLaren |first1=N |title=A critical review of the biopsychosocial model. |journal=The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry |date=February 1998 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=86–92; discussion 93–6 |doi=10.3109/00048679809062712 |pmid=9565189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernhard Paul ″Buddy″ Elias''' (2 June 1925 – 16 March 2015) was a Swiss actor and president of the Anne Frank Fonds, the foundation dedicated to preserving the memory of his cousin [[Anne Frank]].

==Biography==

Elias was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in [[Germany]] in 1925. His father, Erich Elias, became head of the [[Basel]]-based [[Opekta]] company in 1929 and Bernhard moved there in 1931. In 1947 he joined [[Holiday on Ice]] and was with them for over ten years and later acted on stage in Switzerland, Great Britain, France, and Germany. In the mid-1970s, he appeared increasingly in film and television, mainly in [[Holocaust]]-themed productions. His mother was Helene Frank, Anne Frank's paternal aunt.

Elias was the first cousin and last-surviving close relative of Holocaust diarist [[Anne Frank]], who died in the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] in February or March 1945. He was president of the Anne Frank Fonds, located in Basel. The Anne Frank Fonds is responsible for the rights of Franks' ''[[Diary of a Young Girl]]'', which until his death in 1980 had been headed by her father, [[Otto Frank]]. 

Elias lived in Basel with his wife, Gerti Elias (''née'' Wiedner), where he died on 16 March 2015. They had two sons, Patrick and Oliver, who became actors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5428">'''Buffalo Readings''' is a [[poetry]] reading series and group. There have been hundreds of Buffalo Readings held since 2002. Members of the Buffalo Readings refer to themselves as "Buffalo" or "Buffalo Poets" and encourage listeners to shout out "moose" in addition to applauding at a Buffalo Reading. They do not hold poetry slams, and they have cited their dislike of slams as a factor in the formation of the group.&lt;ref name="Buffalo Readings"&gt;Buffalo Readings. [http://www.buffaloreadings.com/article.php?story=about About Buffalo Readings]. Retrieved May 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Buffalo Poets were the featured bloggers on the [[Oxford University Press]] website for [[National Poetry Month]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford University Press]]. [http://blog.oup.com/2007/04/intro_buffalo_poetry/ National Poetry Month: Fevers of Artistic Dreams]. Retrieved May 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The group was founded in [[New York City]] in 2001 by the original three Buffalo poets: David Acevedo, Roger Kenny, and Anthony Morena. All three were friends from high school, and had been collaborating on the independent "Ripped Magazine" Issue 4. During this time Roger was renting a room in a Victorian style house in Jersey City, which became the creative nexus for the early Buffalo Poets. The first official Buffalo Readings was held on February 21, 2002 at Fat Cat Jazz and Billiards on Christopher St. in Manhattan's [[West Village, Manhattan|West Village]]. The show included performances by several poets, a live DJ, musical performance, and video performances, including an anaglyph video of poet Kurtis Darby reading.&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Readings. [http://www.buffaloreadings.com/mediagallery/album.php?aid=8&amp;page=1 Media Gallery]. Retrieved May 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Red/Blue 3D glasses were distributed with admission. After the show, on the trip back to the Jersey City house, the poets gave out 3D glasses to commuters on one car of the Path train. The entire car was full of people wearing 3D glasses, even a police officer partook.

Soon after the initial reading, with Anthony no longer part of the group, but with the new member Noah Levin in tow, the Buffalo met the revolutionary activist Rafael Bueno, who was running the squat turned community center "Casa Del Sol: Future City" in the Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno. [http://www.bordersphere.com/new/rafael_bueno.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to a successful 3 year reading series held every third Friday at Casa Del Sol, with Bueno joining as a regular member of the Buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Bueno [http://blog.oup.com/2007/09/bueno/].&lt;/ref&gt; Although the early readings at Casa were held in pitch dark, with no electricity, and the only heat from a wood-burning stove, by the pinnacle of the readings the Buffalo were attracting a full house of fans interested in the free spirit of the readings. The readings continued their successful run until Casa Del Sol was shut down by the police on November 20, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Infoshop News. [http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=04/11/16/7010015 Rally and Concerts to Preserve Casa Del Sol]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523100319/http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=04%2F11%2F16%2F7010015 |date=May 23, 2011 }}. Retrieved May 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Times]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/nyregion/thecity/05casa.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fE%2fEvictions Down at the Grass Roots, an Emotional Fight Over Turf]. Retrieved May 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Casa Del Sol's closing, the Buffalo Readings expanded to the West Coast via David Acevedo who took the Buffalo Readings first to [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Seattle]], then [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. In Portland the series gained some momentum, attracting many new artists into the Buffalo fold. While the expansion to the West Coast was a success; post-Casa Del Sol's closing the East Coast Buffalo continued to hold events.  Between the East &amp; West Coast groups (including many members traveling between both coasts), the Buffalo found themselves featured on KBOO FM's "Talking Earth" several times, headlining gigs at [[Big Sur]], one member (David Acevedo) published in the book Heal (Between the Pages of These Folks We Seek a Panacea), and the Buffalo as a whole found themselves as the featured house poets on the  [[Oxford University Press]] Blog during [[National Poetry Month]] and also throughout the summer of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://poetry.about.com/od/poetrybooks/a/poetrypicks2005_4.htm Yet Again More Poetry Picks: The Best of 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press. [http://blog.oup.com/?s=buffalo+poets&amp;Submit.x=0&amp;Submit.y=0 Buffalo Poets]. Retrieved November 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the Buffalo find themselves inactive.

Throughout the history of the Buffalo, they have attracted many members on throughout the US which currently include: King Otho, Noah Levin, David Acevedo, Kevin Callahan, James Honzik, Michael “Molotov” Franklin, Shakuhachi Jon, the jazz band Flip, Brian Kenny and the activist Rafael Bueno.  The Buffalo's aim throughout the years has stayed the same, to inspire other artists to shake all structures, inspired towards an artistic and creative revolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9506">'''Civitas: The Institute for the Study of Civil Society''' is an independent [[Think tank|think tank]], not affiliated to a political party, aimed at developing public understanding of the framework of a free and democratic society. Key issues include crime, schooling, health, immigration and the family unit.

==Background==
Civitas was founded by [[David George Green]] and [[Robert Whelan (Civitas)|Robert Whelan]] early in 2000 as an independent [[think tank]].  It is a [[Charitable trust#United Kingdom|British registered charity]] (No. 1085494),&lt;ref name="charity_reg"&gt;{{EW charity|1085494|Civitas}}&lt;/ref&gt; financed by private donations. It receives no government funding and has no affiliations with any political party.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} It received a large donation for a three-year programme of research from [[The Reece Foundation]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="whofundsyou?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whofundsyou.org/org/funding/civitas|title=Civitas - funding information|website=whofundsyou.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Civitas website states that "We publish the names of donors who, on request, are willing to be identified". However, its website provides no up to date information on its funders.&lt;ref&gt;"About Us", Civitas website, https://web.archive.org/web/20170301114033/http://www.civitas.org.uk/about-us/ (accessed 01 March 2017, most recent donor information provided is for 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

The stated underlying purpose of Civitas is to deepen public understanding of the legal, institutional and moral framework that makes a free and democratic society possible.

They state that what they do is:

*Support informed public debate and encourage consensus by:
**Providing accurate factual information on today's social issues.
**Publishing informed comment and analysis.
**Bringing together leading protagonists in open discussion.
*Work towards pragmatic solutions to current social problems.
*Implement pioneering projects to demonstrate what can be accomplished.
*Supply schools with teaching materials and guest speakers.

== Policy interests ==

The think tank describes itself as "[[classical liberalism|classical liberal]]" and "non-partisan". However ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' have described it as a "right-of-centre think-tank".&lt;ref name=times-20140124&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/education/article3984346.ece |title=Gove allies say 'Sixties-mired' Ofsted should be scrapped |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph-20140407&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10749930/A-close-encounter-with-the-property-boom.html |title=A close encounter with the property boom |author=Philip Johnston |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its director David G. Green writes occasionally in ''The Daily Telegraph'' and its deputy director [[Anastasia de Waal]] frequently contributes to ''The Guardian's'' "[[Comment is free]]" section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anastasiadewaal|title=Anastasia de Waal|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its areas of policy interest include:

* [[Crime]]: Civitas authors have argued for more consistent crime policies that straddle the left-right divide, for earlier and pre-emptive interventions with prolific offenders and for crime statistics to be more digestibly and honestly presented.  They have also advocated rehabilitating prisoners through drug programmes and vocational education.
* [[Education]]: Civitas research seeks out an objective view of standards of education in Britain in order to offer an improved perspective on how best to deliver equitable and high standards of education for all.  The particular aim is to generate evidence-based policy, with realisable strategies for implementation. It has called for a new inspectorate to replace [[Ofsted]] for [[Free school (England)|free schools]] and [[Academy (English school)|academies]], and ''The Times'' has described Civitas as an ally of former Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]].&lt;ref name=times-20140124/&gt;
* [[Family]]: Its authors have examined the impact of social policy and changing social norms in families, looking in particular at family structure and the socioeconomic significance of marriage in the UK.
* [[Health]]: Civitas authors have called for an end to the [[National Health Service|NHS]]'s monopoly on public healthcare (in effect for greater privatisation of health service delivery) and greater diversity in the system with the purported aim of creating a more equitable system for all.
* [[Immigration]]: Its authors have sought to analyse the pros and cons of mass immigration, including the costs for the public sector and downward pressure on low-paid jobs. They claim that 'multiculturalism now means the co-existence in one land of rival and antagonistic ways of life'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/AuditedAccounts2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Economic growth]]: The Wealth of Nations project was established to encourage a more balanced economy and especially to explore how best to stimulate manufacturing in order to foster a more resilient economy and to generate jobs across the ability range.
* [[Welfare]]: Civitas believes people should 'keep their own earnings' and 'pay their own way'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/AuditedAccounts2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involvement in schools ==
Civitas provides teaching materials and guest speakers for schools, in particular on family structure and on the [[European Union|EU]].

The EU project publishes a series of free factsheets on the European Union, designed for use by A-level students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; Civitas also arranges speakers for talks and debates in schools on the subject of the EU.

Civitas runs supplementary schools on Saturday mornings and after school hours. The schools teach English and maths to children from disadvantaged backgrounds, emphasising traditional approaches such as [[phonics]]. There are now twenty supplementary schools in [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross]], [[Hammersmith]], [[Camberwell]], [[Keighley]], [[Birmingham]], [[Great Yarmouth]] and [[Bradford]] providing classes for over 600 children per week.

Civitas is adapting the American Core Knowledge curriculum for the UK. It is a year-by-year outline of the specific and shared content and skills to be taught in Years 1 to 6.  The first Core Knowledge book, ''What Your Year 1 Child Needs to Know'', aroused controversy over its message to minorities when released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6092124 English version of US fact bible for Year 1s hits the shops] at the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The books for Year 1 and Year 2 were published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coreknowledge.org.uk/|title=Core Knowledge UK: Educational Resources and Activities for Teachers, Home Educators, Parents and Grandparents to Help Children Excel in Primary School and Beyond|website=www.coreknowledge.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pp-move-indef|small=yes}}
'''Collective consciousness''', '''collective conscience''',  or '''collective conscious''' ({{lang-fr|conscience collective}}) is the set of shared beliefs, ideas, and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', p93.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was introduced by the French [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] in his ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' in 1893.

The French word ''conscience'' generally means "conscience", "consciousness", "awareness",&lt;ref&gt;''Collins French-English Dictionary'' [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/conscience ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt; or "perception".&lt;ref&gt;Shaun Best, ''A Beginner's Guide to Social Theory'',  p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators and translators of Durkheim disagree on which is most appropriate, or whether the translation should depend on the context.  Some prefer to treat the word 'conscience' as an untranslatable foreign word or technical term, without its normal English meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, George (Trans.) in Durkheim, Emile "The Division of Labour in Society" The Free Press, New York, 1993. pp. ix&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it does not refer to the specifically moral conscience, but to a shared understanding of social norms.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Wren, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QttlGM7NQx0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Collective%20consciousness%22&amp;f=false Conceptions of Culture: What Multicultural Educators Need to Know]'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

As for "collective", Durkheim makes clear that he is not [[Reification (fallacy)|reifying]] or [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasizing]] this concept; for him, it is "collective" simply in the sense that it is common to many individuals;&lt;ref&gt;Warren Schmaus, ''Durkheim's Philosophy of Science and the Sociology of Knowledge: Creating an Intellectual Niche'', 1994, {{ISBN|0226742512}}, p. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt; ''cf.'' [[social fact]].

== In Durkheimian social theory ==

Durkheim used the term in his books ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893), ''[[The Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895), ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), and ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]'' (1912). In ''The Division of Labour'', Durkheim argued that in traditional/primitive societies (those based around clan, family or tribal relationships), [[totem]]ic religion played an important role in uniting members through the creation of a common consciousness (''conscience collective'' in the original French). In societies of this type, the contents of an individual's consciousness are largely shared in common with all other members of their society, creating a [[solidarity (sociology)|mechanical solidarity]] through mutual likeness.

{{quote|The totality of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members of a society forms a determinate system with a life of its own. It can be termed the collective or creative consciousness.|[[Emile Durkheim]]&lt;ref name="AllanAllan2005-108"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Allan|author2=Kenneth D. Allan|title=Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory: Seeing the Social World|date=2 November 2005|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=1-4129-0572-9|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In ''Suicide'', Durkheim developed the concept of [[anomie]] to refer to the social rather than individual causes of suicide. This relates to the concept of collective consciousness, as if there is a lack of integration or solidarity in society then suicide rates will be higher.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. Suicide, 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses of the term ==

Various forms of what might be termed "collective consciousness" in modern societies have been identified by other sociologists, such as Mary Kelsey, going from [[Solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]] attitudes and [[meme]]s to extreme behaviors like [[group-think]], [[herd behavior]], or collectively shared experiences during collective rituals and dance parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308792484_Quantum_Anthropology_Man_Cultures_and_Groups_in_a_Quantum_Perspective|title=Collective consciousness and collective unconscious in anthropology - Chapter 7 in Quantum anthropology: Man, cultures, and groups in a quantum perspective|last=Trnka R., Lorencova R.|first=|publisher=Charles University Karolinum Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Prague|pages=81–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Combs, A., &amp; Krippner, S.|year=2008|title=Collective consciousness and the social brain|url=|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|volume=15|pages=264–276|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://sociology.berkeley.edu/visiting-faculty/mary-e-kelsey Mary Kelsey], sociology lecturer in the [[University of California, Berkeley]], used the term in the early 2000s to describe people within a social group, such as mothers, becoming aware of their shared traits and circumstances, and as a result acting as a community and achieving solidarity. Rather than existing as separate individuals, people come together as dynamic groups to share resources and knowledge. It has also developed as a way of describing how an entire community comes together to share similar values. This has also been termed "hive mind", "[[Collective intelligence|group mind]]", "'''mass mind'''", and "'''social mind'''".&lt;ref&gt;John D. Greenwood ''The Disappearance of the Social in American Social Psychology'' 2004, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a theory the character of collective consciousness depends on the type of mnemonic encoding used within a group (Tsoukalas, 2007). The specific type of encoding used has a predictable influence on the groups behavior and collective ideology. Informal groups, that meet infrequently and spontaneously, have a tendency to represent significant aspects of their community as episodic memories. This usually leads to strong social cohesion and solidarity, an indulgent atmosphere, an exclusive ethos and a restriction of social networks. Formal groups, that have scheduled and anonymous meetings, tend to represent significant aspects of their community as semantic memories which usually leads to weak social cohesion and solidarity, a more moderate atmosphere, an inclusive ethos and an expansion of social networks.&lt;ref name="Tsoukalas´2007"&gt;Tsoukalas, I. (2007). Exploring the Microfoundations of Group Consciousness. ''[[Culture and Psychology]]'', 13(1), 39-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Society is made up of various collective groups, such as the family, community, organizations, regions, nations which as Burns and Egdahl state "''can be considered to possess agential capabilities'': to think, judge, decide, act, reform; to conceptualize self and others as well as self's actions and interactions; and to reflect."&lt;ref&gt;Burns, T.R. Engdahl, E. (1998) The Social Construction of Consciousness. Part 1: Collective Consciousness and its Socio-Cultural Foundations, ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]'', 5 (1) p 72.&lt;/ref&gt;(italics in the original). Burns and Egdahl note that during the [[Second World War]] different nations behaved differently [[the Holocaust|towards their Jewish populations]].&lt;ref&gt;Burns, T.R. Engdahl, E. (1998) The Social Construction of Consciousness. Part 1: Collective Consciousness and its Socio-Cultural Foundations, ''Journal of  Consciousness Studies'', 5 (1) p 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of the Jews in Europe|Jewish populations]] of [[History of the Jews in Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[History of the Jews in Denmark#The Nazi era|Denmark]] survived whereas the majority of the Jewish populations [[History of the Jews in Slovakia|in Slovakia]] and [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungary]] did not survive [[the Holocaust]]. It is suggested that these different national behaviors vary according to the different collective consciousness between nations. This illustrates that differences in collective consciousness can have practical significance.

Edmans, Garcia, and Norlia examined national sporting defeats and correlated them with decreases in the value of stocks.  They examined 1,162 football matches in thirty-nine countries and discovered that stock markets of those countries dropped on average forty-nine points after being eliminated from the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], and thirty-one points after being eliminated in other tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;Edmans, A. García, D. Norli, O. 2007 Sports Sentiment and Stock Returns. ''[[Journal of Finance]]'' 62 (4) pp. 1967-1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Edmans, Garcia, and Norli found similar but smaller effects with international [[cricket]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[ice hockey]], and [[basketball]] games.

== Gramsci and Collective Consciousness ==

According to Michelle Filippini’s book ''Using Gramsci'', on [[Antonio Gramsci]], “A collective consciousness, which is to say a living organism, is formed only after the unification of the multiplicity through friction on the part of the individuals; nor can one say that ‘silence’ is not a multiplicity.”&lt;ref&gt; Filippini, Michelle. 2017. “Collective Organisms.” Pp. 58-59 in Using Gramsci. London: Pluto Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h64kxd.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, a form of collective consciousness can be based on fact that Gramsci’s conception of [[hegemony]] vis-à-vis the hegemony of the [[ruling class]] played a role in mobilizing the collective consciousness of those who are [[oppressed]] by the ruling ideas of [[society]], or the ruling hegemony. Collective consciousness in this sense can refer to a [[multitude]] of different individual forms of consciousness coalescing into a greater whole. As to whether this whole is unified, this is up for debate. In Gramsci’s view, a unified whole is composed of [[solidarity]] among its different constituent parts, and therefore, this whole cannot be uniformly the same. Rather, it can and should embrace different forms of consciousness (or individual experiences of social reality), which coexist to reflect the different experiences of the [[marginalized]] peoples in a given society. This is in accordance with Gramsci’s theory of Marxism and [[class struggle]] applied to cultural contexts. [[Cultural Marxism]] (as distinguished from the right-wing use of the term) embodies the concept of collective consciousness. It incorporates [[social movements]] that are based on some sort of collective identity; these identities can include, for instance, [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and [[Aptitude|ability]], and can be incorporated by collective-based movements into a broader historical material analysis of class struggle.
 
Gramsci’s theory of collective consciousness thus departs from conventional stereotypes of [[Marxism]] as being a purely deterministic, [[anti-humanist]] ‘ideology.’ Marxism is often attacked as being somewhat devoid of the interpersonal experiences of the subaltern. Yet, as Gramsci points out, “Modern politics thus ‘abolishes the state as a federation of classes – but certain forms of the internal life of the subaltern classes are reborn as parties, trade unions, cultural associations.’&lt;big&gt;6&lt;/big&gt; “&lt;ref&gt; Filippini, Michelle. 2017. “Collective Organisms.” Pp. 44 in Using Gramsci. London: Pluto Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h64kxd.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the essential collective consciousness of the [[subaltern]] manifests itself in the forms of free associations like the aforementioned as a unifying force of diversity in the realm of society and the state. The [[state (polity)|state]] itself is an entity that is made up of civil society, in which different groups compete for political power. Thus, a multiple collective consciousness can exist within the [[body politic]]. This collective consciousness is often used to advocate for basic [[human rights]] at the national and international level. Collective consciousness in these instances can lead to a greater [[social consciousness]] among people and can act as a reinforcing framework for Marxist thought.

According to Filippini, “The nature and workings of collective organisms – not only parties, but also trade unions, associations and intermediate bodies in general – represent a specific sphere of reflection in the Prison Notebooks, particularly in regard to the new relationship between State and society that in Gramsci’s view emerged during the age of mass politics.”&lt;ref&gt; Filippini, Michelle. 2017. “Collective Organisms.” Pp. 43 in Using Gramsci. London: Pluto Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h64kxd.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Collective organisms can express collective consciousness. Whether this form of expression finds itself in the realm of the state or the realm of society is up to the direction that the subjects take in expressing their collective consciousness. In Gramsci’s famous [[Prison Notebooks]], the ongoing conflict between [[civil society]], the [[bureaucracy]], and the state necessitates the emergence of a collective consciousness that can often act as an intermediary between these different realms. The public organizations of protest, such as [[labor unions]] and anti-war organizations, are vehicles that can unite multiple types of collective consciousness. Although identity-based movements are necessary for the progress of [[democracy]] and can generate collective consciousness, they cannot completely do so without a unifying framework. This is why [[anti-war]] and [[labor movements]] provide an avenue that has united various social movements under the banner of a multiple collective consciousness. This is also why future social movements need to have an [[ethos]] of collective consciousness if they are to succeed in the long-term.

== Cognitive Knowledge and Collective Consciousness ==

According to Zukerfeld, “The different disciplines that have studied knowledge share an understanding of it as a product of human subjects – individual, collective, etc.”&lt;ref&gt; Zukerfeld, M. 2017. “How to Know Knowledge? Introducing Cognitive Materialism.” Pp. 31 in Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism. London: University of Westminster Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6zd9v0.6. License: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Knowledge]] in a sociological sense is derived from social conditions and [[social realities]]. Collective consciousness also reflects social realities, and sociological knowledge can be gained through the adoption of a collective consciousness. Many different disciplines such as [[philosophy]] and [[literature]] examine collective consciousness from different lenses. These different disciplines reach a similar understanding of a collective consciousness despite their different approaches to the subject. The inherent humanness in the idea of collective consciousness refers to a shared way of thinking among human beings in the pursuit of knowledge. Individual knowledge can be distinguished from collective knowledge by its emphasis on individual people as opposed to groups of people. Collective consciousness is thus group-oriented rather than individualistic. 

Collective consciousness, to some degree, can be distinguished from social consciousness. Indeed, according to Zukerfeld, “the problem is the integration of the subject in the web of 'social relations'. These, particularly those of production, are what determine ‘social consciousness.’ “&lt;ref&gt; Zukerfeld, M. 2017. “How to Know Knowledge? Introducing Cognitive Materialism.” Pp. 25 in Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism. London: University of Westminster Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6zd9v0.6. License: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 &lt;/ref&gt; If social consciousness is determined by social relations, then collective consciousness is determined by collective relations. There is a big difference between the two. Social relations refer to material, historically determined relations, primarily of [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Exchange (economics)|exchange]], between people. Collective relations, on the other hand, refers to the co-existence of different groups of people or the 'collective'. Coexistence is what ultimately determines the level of collective consciousness in any given society. Societies with a higher level of collective consciousness are more likely to accept the principle of human [[cooperation]] versus the principle of human [[competition]].

Collective consciousness can provide a new understanding of the relationship between [[self]] and society.  As Zukerfeld states, “Even though it impels us, as a first customary gesture, to analyse the subjective (such as individual consciousness) or intersubjective bearers (such as the values of a given society), in other words those which Marxism and sociology examine, now we can approach them in an entirely different light.”&lt;ref&gt; Zukerfeld, M. 2017. “How to Know Knowledge? Introducing Cognitive Materialism.” Pp. 36 in Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism. London: University of Westminster Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6zd9v0.6. License: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 &lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous modes of thought, “cognitive materialism”&lt;ref&gt; Zukerfeld, M. 2017. “How to Know Knowledge? Introducing Cognitive Materialism.” Pp. 31 in Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism. London: University of Westminster Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6zd9v0.6. License: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 &lt;/ref&gt; is presented in the work by Zukerfeld as a sort of ‘third way’ between sociological knowledge and Marxism. Cognitive materialism is based on a kind of collective consciousness of the [[mind]]. This consciousness in turn can be used, with cognitive materialism as a guiding force, by human beings in order to critically analyze society and social conditions. [[Critical analysis]] will then spur collective action to solve these social problems. Once the goals of solving these problems have been achieved, the creation of a new, humane society will involve some degree of collective consciousness. Collective consciousness, in this case, is a mechanism to analyze subjective societal factors and integrate them into the overall framework of social analysis. 

== Literary/Oral Tradition and Collective Consciousness ==
In a work using a Serbian folk story as a case study on the collective experience of oral and literary traditions, Wolfgang Ernst examines collective consciousness in terms of forms of [[Media (communication)|media]]. "Current discourse analysis drifts away from the 'culturalist turn' of the last two or three decades and its concern with individual and collective memory as an extended target of historical research".&lt;ref&gt; Ernst, Wolfgang. 2017. "Electrified Voices: Non-Human Agencies of Socio-Cultural Memory".  Pp. 41 in ''Memory in Motion'', edited by Ina Blom, Trond Lundemo, and Eivind Røssaak. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jd94f0.5. &lt;/ref&gt; Despite this turn away from questions of individual and collective knowledge, there is still a collective consciousness present in terms of the shared appreciation of [[folk stories]] and [[oral traditions]]. Folk stories enable the subject and the audiences to come together around a common experience and a shared heritage. In the case of the Serbian folk “gusle”&lt;ref&gt; Ernst, Wolfgang. 2017. ‘Electrified Voices’: Non-Human Agencies of Socio-Cultural Memory.”  Pp. 45 in Memory in Motion, edited by Ina Blom, Trond Lundemo, and Eivind Røssaak. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jd94f0.5. &lt;/ref&gt; , the Serbian people take pride in this musical instrument of epic poetry and oral tradition and play it at social gatherings. Expressions of [[art]] and [[culture]] are, ultimately, expressions of a collective consciousness. They can also be expressions of multiple social realities. Regardless, a permeating collective consciousness exists in society and can be expressed through multiple modes of communication.

Collective consciousness has a relationship with [[collective memory]]. “Collective memory is thus no longer a reference to a remembered past but a way of analyzing the present as a collection of big (meta-)data in real-time for future prediction.”&lt;ref&gt; Ernst, Wolfgang. 2017. ‘Electrified Voices’: Non-Human Agencies of Socio-Cultural Memory.”  Pp. 55 in Memory in Motion, edited by Ina Blom, Trond Lundemo, and Eivind Røssaak. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jd94f0.5. &lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the collective consciousness of the people, manifested through forms of [[literary]] and cultural media, can be quantified by [[big data]]. Big data can be a representation of collective consciousness insofar as it tries to quantify the experiences of the public on the Internet. However, there is a limit to quantifying social experiences. Collective consciousness that is independent of any sort of quantifiable data, namely through oral tradition, has always been a part of human culture and will continue to remain so. In the future, collective consciousness will also remain as a huge part of human society. However, the form it will take will be very different from the form it is taking now.

Finally, it is important to remember the realness involved in creating a collective consciousness. [[Reality]] is socially defined, and is based on the social experiences of human beings. Indeed, as Ernst argues, “Phonographic recordings of real voices irritate the historical consciousness of cultural memory.”&lt;ref&gt; Ernst, Wolfgang. 2017. ‘Electrified Voices’: Non-Human Agencies of Socio-Cultural Memory.”  Pp. 51 in Memory in Motion, edited by Ina Blom, Trond Lundemo, and Eivind Røssaak. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jd94f0.5. &lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis laid here on [[authenticity]] is also what makes up the lived experience of collective consciousness. The authenticity of collective consciousness necessitates human participation in order to provide it with a deeper meaning. If reality is not authentic and does not represent the social experiences of the collective, collective consciousness will also cease to have any significant meaning. Rather, it will become submerged in favor of an inauthentic, [[artificial]] sense of reality and society. Therefore, the final attribute of collective consciousness is its fundamental essence of reality as opposed to unreality.

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
'''Compassionate release''' is a process by which inmates in criminal justice systems may be eligible for immediate early release on grounds of "particularly extraordinary or compelling circumstances which could not reasonably have been foreseen by the court at the time of sentencing".&lt;ref name="Bureau of Prisons"&gt;{{cite web|title=Compassionate Release/Reduction in Sentence:  Procedures for Implementation of 18 U.S.C.  §§ 3582(c)(1)(A) and 4205(g)|url=http://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5050_049.pdf|publisher=United States Federal Bureau of Prisons|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compassionate release procedures, which are also known as '''medical release''', '''medical parole''', '''medical furlough''' and '''humanitarian parole''', can be mandated by the courts or by internal corrections authorities. Unlike [[parole]], compassionate release is not based on a prisoner's behavior or sentencing, but on medical or humanitarian changes in the prisoner's situation.

==Request process==

Obtaining a compassionate release for a [[prison]] inmate is a process that varies from country to country (and sometimes even within countries) but generally involves petitioning the [[Prison warden|warden]] or court to the effect that the subject is terminally ill and would benefit from obtaining aid outside of the prison system, or is otherwise eligible under the relevant law.

Compassionate release is most often granted to inmates with [[terminal illness]]es that cause life expectancies of time periods less than between six and eighteen months, depending on the [[jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name=bop&gt;{{cite web|title=Compassionate Release/Reduction in Sentence:  Procedures for Implementation of 18 U.S.C.  §§ 3582(c)(1)(A) and 4205(g)|url=http://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5050_049.pdf|publisher=US Board of Prisons|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beck&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=John A.|title=Compassionate Release from New York State Prisons|journal=Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics|date=Fall 1999|volume=27|pages=216|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=10&amp;sid=cf35e5f3-7c02-4ca3-a15e-82f9071f95af%40sessionmgr198&amp;hid=117&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=2677051|accessdate=1 May 2014|doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.1999.tb01455.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ca_cr&gt;{{cite web|title=California Penal Code Section 1170|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/1170.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other allowable causes for compassionate release may be medical but non-terminal, such as incurable debilitating mental or physical conditions that prevent inmate self-care or a combination of advanced age and irreversible [[aging-associated disease|age-related conditions]] that prevent functioning in a prison setting.
Prisoners with illness such as Alzheimer's would be considered eligible for release.  

Grounds for compassionate release may also be familial, although not all [[jurisdiction]]s offer this option. Under [[United States]] Federal law for example inmates may be released to care for a minor child or debilitated spouse in the absence of other family caregivers. This is intended to be subsequent to the death or debilitation of the child’s primary caregiver in the former case or the finding of permanent mental or physical disability of the spouse in the latter. While there are clear advantages to the individual in this type of release, there are many procedural obstacles to this type of petition which lead to it rarely being granted.

==Arguments==
Debate as to the relative merits of compassionate release is ongoing, and major arguments are presented below.

===Proponents===
Arguments for expansion of compassionate release programs generally address the benefit to terminally ill prisoners as well as cost savings to the state. Terminal illness which requires special care or treatment is a major concern for prison inmates who may be unable to access the same type or quality of care in [[prison]] as they would outside of an institutional setting. These illnesses can further shorten the lifespan of the individual while he or she is in prison, a setting that already has poorer health outcomes and a lower life expectancy than the general population.&lt;ref name=Spaulding&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spaulding|first=Anne C.|author2=el al|title=Prisoner Survival Inside and Outside of the Institution|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=2011|pages=479–487|doi=10.1093/aje/kwq422|volume=173|pmc=3044840}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bureau of Prisons]] estimates that the United States would save $5.8 million per year by releasing 100 people on compassionate release per year,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 2013 | title = Compassionate release in the USA | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 381 | issue = 9878| page = 1598 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(13)61007-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USDOJsavings&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/oig/reports/2013/e1306.pdf "The Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Compassionate Release Program."]&lt;/ref&gt; and overcrowding would be lessened. Those who are approved for compassionate release have a lower tendency to recommit crime,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;O'Meara, Gregory. "Compassion and the Public Interest: Wisconsin's New Compassionate Release Legislation." Federal Sentencing Reporter 23.1 (2010): 33-38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; which is attributed to those being released being in extremely poor health, as well as possibly due to the careful screening process inmates go through for risk of recidivism before approval for compassionate release can be granted.

===Opponents===
Compassionate release relies on good faith, requiring that the released inmates do not continue committing crimes after they have been released; while many of these criminals are in very poor health, some are not incapacitated, and their reintroduction into society puts them back into a setting where they would be free to commit crimes.  A questionnaire study by Jennifer Boothby and Lorraine Overduin on attitudes towards compassionate release suggested that the general public have negative attitudes towards the compassionate release of prisoners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Boothby, Jennifer, and Lorraine Overduin. "Attitudes Regarding the Compassionate Release of Terminally Ill Offenders." The Prison Journal 87.4 (2007): 408-15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the community’s negative attitudes toward compassionately released prisoners could be an obstacle to those seeking an expansion of this type of resentencing, and that there is a negative attitude in communities over mingling with those convicted of crimes meriting time potentially up to life sentences. Another argument against compassionate release is fairness and concern over justice for time served; for those that were placed in [[prison]] justifiably, the question arises of how long they should be forced to serve for their crimes before they are allowed renewed access to their community for health and support, and state and federal laws generally stipulate guidelines that address minimum proportions of sentences that must be served prior to eligibility for compassionate release.

The process of obtaining compassionate release on medical grounds has been criticized in multiple states for being highly subjective on a case-by-case basis, relying heavily on specific doctors' opinions and for not having sufficiently clear-cut guidelines as to what defines a patient as being eligible for compassionate release.&lt;ref name="Berry III"/&gt; This often results in calls for reform, fueled by statistics regarding the rate of compassionate release and the illnesses of the patients who do not receive it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

==Implementation==
A major roadblock to the implementation of compassionate release is its reliance on medical trial. Because the criteria for medically based petitions for compassionate release is, by necessity, dependent on medicine and doctors, individual medical professionals have an inordinate amount of power in determining each compassionate release case.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Brie A. | last2 = Greifinger | first2 = Robert | last3 = Morrison | first3 = R. Sean | year = 2011 | title = Balancing Punishment and Compassion for Seriously Ill Prisoners | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 155 | issue = 2| pages = 122–126 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-155-2-201107190-00348 | pmid=21628351 | pmc=3163454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the high degree of variation among individual medical professionals, the high variation that is translated into each decision is a major issue in many of the current compassionate release systems. The inconsistency of current systems of compassionate release is a common flaw that hinders increased use of compassionate release.

==Other options==

For prisoners suffering from terminal illnesses, alternative options include programs that distribute health materials and segregation of affected individuals &lt;ref&gt;Aldenberg, William B. "Bursting at the Seams: An Analysis of Compassionate-Release Statutes and the Current Problem of HIV and AIDS in U.S. Prisons and Jails." New England journal on Criminal and Civil Confinement 24.2 (1998): 541-98. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded hospice programs. [[Hospice]] programs within the prisons have been used, although this does not address the humanitarian aspect of allowing inmates to die with dignity among family and friends, and the issue of cost to the state still looms large. Specialized medical care in a [[prison]] setting is difficult to achieve and is a costly proposition. With the prison population aging and in poorer health than the general population, as previously mentioned, cost may become a prohibitive factor, increasing the attraction of compassionate release where possible.

For non-medical cases such as care for a family member in the absence of other available parties, practical alternatives are difficult to identify. A minor child or disabled spouse for whom no other caregiver is available is likely to end up as a ward of the courts or in institutional care if the compassionate release request is not granted.

As of 2009, [[Corrections]] systems with compassionate release procedures included the United States [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] (often known as the BOP),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bop.gov/news/press/press_releases/ipaorg.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland, England and Wales, China,&lt;ref&gt;^ "China Grants Convicted Scholars Medical Parole". The Chronicle of Higher Education. http://chronicle.com/weekly/v47/i47/47a04501.htm. Retrieved 2008-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt; France, New Zealand and 36 of the 50 U.S. state prison systems.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-08-13-furloughs_N.htm "36 states release ill or dying inmates"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compassionate release by country==

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] legislation includes a provision for prisoners to apply for compassionate release from prison. Section 41 of the Parole Act 2002 provides that the [[Parole board]] may, on referral by the chairperson, direct that an offender be released on compassionate release on either of the following grounds: (a) the offender has given birth to a child or (b) the offender is seriously ill and is unlikely to recover.&lt;ref&gt; [http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0010/73.0/DLM137632.html Parole Act 2002 s41 (NZ)] &lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Corrections is not responsible for decisions regarding compassionate release of prisoners. When a prisoner is seriously ill and unlikely to recover, an application will be made to the New Zealand Parole Board where an independent decision will be made.&lt;ref&gt;"Compassionate Release" (17 May 2017) (Obtained under Official Information Act 1982 Request to the Department of Corrections) &lt;/ref&gt; All prisoners in New Zealand are eligible for compassionate release. The length of a sentence or eligibility for parole are not factors that will affect the prisoner’s ability to apply for compassionate release.&lt;ref&gt;(18 February 2009) 652 NZPD 1420 &lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, a high profile prisoner, Vicki Ravana Letele was granted compassionate release from prison. Letele was sentenced to three years and two months for ten charges of dishonestly using a document. The application for compassionate release was based on Letele’s diagnosis of metastatic cancer. Her illness was terminal with a life expectancy of 6 months. The chairman of the Parole Board, Hon J W Gendall initially declined Letele’s release on compassionate grounds, citing that "it is quite often the case that prisoners contract or are diagnosed with serious illness but if they can be adequately treated and managed in prison and death is not imminent…that compassionate release is not appropriate. It is not the case that family and others may reasonably believe that the prisoner should be in care of his/her family at such difficult times."&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/decisions-of-public-interest/decisions/decisions-2016/offender_seeks_early_parole_consideration_-_271016.htmlNew Zealand Parole Board Decision "Vicki Ravana Letele" (27 October 2016, Wellington)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The serving Prime Minister of New Zealand in 2016, [[John Key|Sir John Key]], voiced his opinion on the Letele case following widespread public outcry and protest. Key stated that "I would have thought we were a pretty compassionate country. We do need to take on board the criminal activity that the person’s undertaken but I don’t think we want to see people dying in prison if, on compassionate grounds, it’s reasonable they be returned home."&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11745610 Phil Taylor "Dying prisoner Vickie Letele arrives home to emotional welcome" The New Zealand Herald (online ed, Auckland, 10 November 2016)] &lt;/ref&gt;  Initial conflicting views between the Ministry of Justice and the Parole Board resolved on 10 November 2016, when the Parole Board under s41(3) of the Parole Act 2002 ordered the compassionate release of Letele. The decision factored in that there was no offending history, the prison security classification was low and Letele was plainly seriously ill and unlikely to recover. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/decisions-of-public-interest/decisions/decisions-2016/letele_-_vicki_ravana_-_10112016.html New Zealand Parole Board Decision "Vicki Ravana Letele" (10 November 2016)] &lt;/ref&gt;

In the last financial year of 2015/2016 seven prisoners were released on compassionate grounds, all cases determined on the basis that they were seriously ill and unlikely to recover. Figures from the years 2006 – 2013 revealed a total of twenty-five applications, with three of those declined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/812540/NZ_Parole_Board_Annual_Report_v6r2.pdfNew Zealand Parole Board "Annual Report" (30 June 2013) at [11]]&lt;/ref&gt; The application process for compassionate release can be difficult to achieve in a timely manner, which is one of the reasons that very few applications are received.&lt;ref&gt; Kerryn Lum "Palliative care behind bars: the New Zealand prison hospice experience" (2004) 17.3-4 Journal of pain and palliative care pharmacotherapy 131 at 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons include the likelihood of a prisoner dying in prison before an application is approved, and an absence of reasonable and available support from family if a prisoner is released from prison. Furthermore, long-stay prisoners may not wish to be released, the prison may be regarded as home, and fellow inmates as family. &lt;ref&gt; Kerryn Lum "Palliative care behind bars: the New Zealand prison hospice experience" (2004) 17.3-4 Journal of pain and palliative care pharmacotherapy 131 at 135. &lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Human rights approach''' 

In practice, the Parole Board only releases prisoners on compassionate release if they are seriously ill and unlikely to recover. However, the Act also provides for compassionate release of a prisoner when they have given birth to a child. &lt;ref&gt;[http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0010/73.0/DLM137632.html Parole Act 2002 s41(a) (NZ)] &lt;/ref&gt; Prison management first assess the prisoner’s suitability, taking account of security classification, the welfare of the prisoner and the child, and the views of the Ministry for Vulnerable Children Oranga Tamariki (formerly Child Youth and Family). A report is then submitted to the Parole Board. &lt;ref&gt; 
Libby Robins "Mother and baby prison units: An investigative study" (paper presented to Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, Christchurch, May 2012)
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the establishment of mother and baby units in prisons has made this provision practically void. The reason it has not been removed from the Act is because it would violate New Zealand’s International Human Rights obligations and be in contravention of s19 of the Bill of Rights Act; Freedom from Discrimination, &lt;ref&gt; New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 s19 &lt;/ref&gt; if it were not available. &lt;ref&gt; Sandra Goudie "Sentencing and Parole Reform Bill – Initial Briefing" (29 April 2009) at [18] &lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively, compassionate release is based on underlying principles of human dignity. Dignity in this sense refers to the right of a human being to have inherent equal and inalienable rights to achieve social progress and better standards of living. Preventing the release of seriously ill prisoners would undeniably violate their human dignity. &lt;ref&gt; Universal Declaration of Human Rights http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

The 2004 review of Human Rights in New Zealand stated that the vulnerability of people in detention was one of New Zealand’s most pressing human rights issues.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.hrc.co.nz/files/3114/2388/0520/HRNZ_10_rights_of_people_who_are_detained.pdf Human Rights in New Zealand "Rights of people who are detained" (2010) at [351]]&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child [[United Nations Convention on the Right's of the Child]] (UNCROC)&lt;ref&gt; Convention on the Rights of the Child 1577 UNTS (opened for signature 20 November 1989, entered into force 2 September 1990)[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/crc.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Convention of Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/cedaw.pdf "Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 1249 UNTS (opened for signature 18 December 1979, entered into force September 3 1981)"]&lt;/ref&gt; are the relevant conventions in relation to compassionate release. In practice, the Department of Corrections supports a child's contact with parents who are in prison when it is in the best interests of the child. Prisoners are encouraged to have positive relationships with their children so they can better reintegrate on release.&lt;ref&gt; 
Ministry of Social Development United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: Fifth Periodic Report by the Government of New Zealand (2015) 
&lt;/ref&gt; These principles uphold New Zealand’s obligations under Article 9 of UNCROC: Separation from Parents, and includes several programs including ‘Mothers with Babies Units’, ‘Mothers and Bonding Facilities’ and importantly, ‘Prison Activities Centres’ that teach fathers parenting skills. &lt;ref&gt; Ministry of Social Development United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: Fifth Periodic Report by the Government of New Zealand (2015) &lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, under New Zealand’s obligations in Article 12 of CEDAW &lt;ref&gt; Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 1249 UNTS (opened for signature 18 December 1979, entered into force 3 September 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; improvements were made in women's correctional facilities to include ‘Mothers with Babies Units’ allowing mothers to keep their children with them in prison up until the age of two, where it was previously 9 months. The aim of this is to achieve a reduction in re-offending for the women and increase their children’s life chances.&lt;ref&gt; Ministry of Social Development United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women: Eighth Periodic Report by the Government of New Zealand (2016) &lt;/ref&gt; Compassionate release must be available to prisoners following the birth of a child in order to meet the obligations that are specified in these conventions.&lt;ref&gt; Sandra Goudie "Sentencing and Parole Reform Bill – Initial Briefing" (29 April 2009) at [18]&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the incorporation of units that enable a relationship between a mother and child in prison are consistent with the obligations that New Zealand has in the context of international human rights. This explains the apparent non-existence of compassionate release on the ground that a prisoner has given birth. &lt;ref&gt; Ministry of Social Development United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women: Eighth Periodic Report by the Government of New Zealand (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

'''[[England]] and [[Wales]]''' 

England and Wales allow applications for early release on compassionate grounds for prisoners serving determinate or indeterminate sentences.&lt;ref&gt; HM Prison Service Prison Service Order 6000 Parole, Release and Recall (31 March 2005) at [12]&lt;/ref&gt; Three general principles are applied during the decision-making process: the safety of the public, new information not available to the court, and whether there was a specific purpose for the early release. &lt;ref&gt; Gabrielle Garton Brimwood and Pat Strickland "Early release from prison in England and Wales: an overview" (Home Affairs Section, 15 May 2013) at [6] &lt;/ref&gt; The Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 s10 provides that the Secretary of State may at any time release a prisoner if they are satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner’s release on compassionate grounds. &lt;ref&gt; Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (UK) s10 &lt;/ref&gt; Compassionate release will be considered where the prisoner is terminally ill, bedridden or severely incapacitated. Where terminal illness is the case, no specific timescale is strictly followed, however a life expectancy of three months or less is suggested. &lt;ref&gt; HM Prison Service Prison Service Order 6000 Parole, Release and Recall (31 March 2005) at [12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisoners serving determinate sentences are also eligible for compassionate release based on tragic family circumstances. Prisoners serving indeterminate sentences are excluded from this provision and are subject to further restricting criteria in an application for compassionate release on the basis of terminal illness. &lt;ref&gt; HM Prison Service Prison Service Order 6000 Parole, Release and Recall (31 March 2005) at [12]&lt;/ref&gt; They will be assessed on the risk of re-offending, particularly of a sexual or violent nature, whether further imprisonment would reduce their life expectancy, whether adequate arrangements are available outside prison, and whether early release will provide some significant benefit to their family.  Where conditions are self-induced, such as a hunger strike or refusal of treatment, an application may be declined. &lt;ref&gt; HM Prison Service Prison Service Order 6000 Parole, Release and Recall (31 March 2005) at [12]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The aging prison population''' 

The rates of death from natural causes have doubled in eight years, with 199 deaths occurring in prison in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/Portals/0/Documents/Bromley%20Briefings/Summer%202017%20factfile.pdf Prison Reform Trust Prison: The Facts (Bromley Briefings, 2017)] &lt;/ref&gt;   The age of the prison population is rising because of a shift in major sentencing trends; prison terms are increasingly longer for the older population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/Portals/0/Documents/Bromley%20Briefings/Summer%202017%20factfile.pdf Prison Reform Trust Prison: The Facts (Bromley Briefings, 2017)] &lt;/ref&gt; The Prison Reform Trust called for a review of the current compassionate release process, commenting on the difficulty that a medical professional will have diagnosing a three-month life expectancy. The Trust recommended that a one-year life expectancy be sufficient for an application of compassionate release from prison. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/Portals/0/Documents/Doing%20Time%20the%20experiences%20and%20needs%20of%20older%20people%20in%20prison.pdf Prison Reform Trust Doing Time: The experiences and needs of older people in prison (A Prison Reform Trust Briefing, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; Former Deputy Director of the Trust observed that older prisoners who are terminally ill are unlikely to pose a risk to the public. His belief was that a range of options should be considered, including compassionate release to ensure that people spend their last days with dignity.&lt;ref&gt; Tamsin Snow "Should dying prisoners be given their freedom for a more dignified end?"(2009) 23 Health and Medical Collection 12 at 13 &lt;/ref&gt;

High profile cases such as the release of [[Reggie Kray]] in 2000 and Ronnie Briggs in 2009 raised issues regarding the term ‘compassionate release’. &lt;ref&gt; Tamsin Snow "Should dying prisoners be given their freedom for a more dignified end?"(2009) 23 Health and Medical Collection 12 at 12 &lt;/ref&gt;The idea that compassion should be exercised in relation to prisoners was a concept that did not reconcile with popular societal views. &lt;ref&gt; Tamsin Snow "Should dying prisoners be given their freedom for a more dignified end?"(2009) 23 Health and Medical Collection 12 at 13 &lt;/ref&gt; Costs associated with medical care for the elderly and terminally ill was noted, with acceptance of the costs that are incurred sending prison guards to hospital and providing palliative care within the prison environment. However, early release is largely deemed to be socially incompatible. &lt;ref&gt; Tamsin Snow "Should dying prisoners be given their freedom for a more dignified end?"(2009) 23 Health and Medical Collection 12 at 13 &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human rights of older persons'''

Compassionate release is founded on a humanitarian concern for the dying, and practical reasons such as high costs or the inability to care adequately for such persons in prison.&lt;ref&gt; Wiebke Bretschneider et al "The collision of care and punishment: Ageing prisoners’ view on compassionate release" (2017) 19 Punishment and Society 5 at 11&lt;/ref&gt; Prison is generally deemed unsuitable for compassionate end-of-life care due to its punitive purpose.&lt;ref&gt; 
NB Mahon "Introduction: Death and dying behind bars – Cross-cutting themes and policy imperatives" (1999) 27 Journal of Law and Medicine Ethics 213 at 215
&lt;/ref&gt; End-of-life care exists in prisons in England and Wales, however, the adequacy of the care has been challenged, as the opposing goals of security and compassionate care are said to be mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt; 
Wiebke Bretschneider et al "The collision of care and punishment: Ageing prisoners’ view on compassionate release" (2017) 19 Punishment and Society 5 at 11
&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, [[the Council of Europe]] European Committee on Crime Problems issued a white paper on [[prison overcrowding]]. The paper addressed the root causes of prison overcrowding and supports the wide application for early release for the seriously ill and aged prisoners on compassionate grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/16806f9a8a European Committee on Crime Problems White Paper on Prison Overcrowding (Directorate General Human Rights and Rule of Law, June 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;   

A 2011 report to the [[UN Secretary-General]] highlighted the difficulties with the aging population, particularly in regard to long-term care of the elderly. This is made worse by the lack of legal framework to monitor human rights violations in long-term care facilities.&lt;ref&gt; Officer of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Human Rights of Older Persons (Summary of the Report to the Secretary-General to the General Assembly, 2011) &lt;/ref&gt; Dying and suffering are not part of a prisoner’s punishment.&lt;ref&gt; NN Dubler "The collision of confinement and care: End-of-life care in prisons and jails" (1998) 26 The Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics 149 at 156 &lt;/ref&gt;  Human rights recommendations for [[aging prisoners]] advocate that necessary changes should be made to adapt to the older prisoner’s physical and mental health. If changes cannot be adequately implemented, then compassionate release of the prisoner should be considered in order not to violate Article 3 on inhumane and degrading treatment of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf European Convention of Human Rights (opened for signature 4 November 1950, entered into force 3 September 1953)]&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Scotland]]
The Scottish legal system permits compassionate release for terminal illness.  There are only a few applications per year, and most are granted.  A prominent case was that of [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]], released on 20 August 2009 because of prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the United States forms of compassionate release are found both federally and in the laws of thirty-nine states. With the [[penal populism|rapid increase in prison populations]] following the introduction of [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentencing]] laws in the 1990s, many people have called for the expanded use of compassionate release as a "safety valve" to relieve overcrowded [[Incarceration in the United States|prison systems]] and reduce pressure on government budgets as well as to ease suffering of inmates and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buckley|first=Cara|title=For Inmates in New York, Hurdles to Compassionate Release|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/30/nyregion/30parole.html?_r=1&amp;|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dubler 1998 149–156"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dubler|first=Nancy|title=The Collision of Confinement and Care|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics|date=1998|volume=26|pages=149–156|doi=10.1111/j.1748-720X.1998.tb01670.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1748-720X.1998.tb01670.x/abstract|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=murphy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Nicole M.|title=Dying to be Free|journal=Marquette Law Review|date=Summer 2012|volume=95|issue=4|pages=1679–1741|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=cf35e5f3-7c02-4ca3-a15e-82f9071f95af%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=117&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=88054153|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Brie|title=Balancing Punishment and Compassion for Seriously Ill Prisoners|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=2011|volume=155|issue=2|pages=122-W44|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=af077555-cd59-42e9-b457-7ecb3e7afce3%40sessionmgr4004&amp;hid=4104&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=63025939|accessdate=2 May 2014|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-155-2-201107190-00348|display-authors=etal|pmid=21628351|pmc=3163454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states have recently expanded their own forms of compassionate release, as can be seen in New York’s changes to its medical parole laws to include both the terminally ill and chronically ill inmates in the absence of a prognosis of imminent death, although this has not necessarily resulted in more releases.

Many who are eligible for compassionate release on grounds of [[terminal illness]] and who have applications pending die in [[prison]] before their cases are processed due to case backlogs and narrow interpretation of the law.&lt;ref name="Berry III"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry III|first=William W.|title=Extraordinary and Compelling: A Re-examination of the Justifications for Compassionate Release|journal=Maryland Law Review|volume=68|series=2009|url=http://works.bepress.com/william_w_berry_iii/3/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of where and how to best deliver end of life care  has been compounded by the sheer number of prisoners now incarcerated in the United States, as well as by the aging of the prison population.&lt;ref name="Dubler 1998 149–156"/&gt;&lt;ref name=williams /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berry III"/&gt;&lt;ref name=beck /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Federal laws governing compassionate release include 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)1(A), which came into effect on 1 November 1987 and governs those whose offenses occurred since it was enacted, and  18 U.S.C. 4205(g), the previous version, which still controls release of inmates who were convicted of offenses that occurred on or prior to that date.&lt;ref name=bop /&gt; States that offer compassionate release each have their own laws governing eligibility, and it may differ from the federal versions both in the requirements for eligibility and in the type of release that can be granted, for example medical parole rather than resentencing.

To seek compassionate release, federal inmates must file a petition with the [[Prison warden|warden]]. Compassionate release is only granted "when there are particularly extraordinary or compelling circumstances which could not reasonably have been foreseen by the court at the time of sentencing."&lt;ref&gt;Compassionate Release, Procedures For Implementation 18 USC 3582/4205, {{cite web |url=http://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5050_046.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902152214/http://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5050_046.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notable recipients====
In 2013, the terminally ill [[Angola 3|Herman Wallace]] was released from [[Angola Prison]] to spend the rest of his life in a personal care home.  He died a few days later.

One notable recipient of compassionate release was [[Lynne Stewart]], a [[criminal defense attorney]] who was convicted of passing messages from imprisoned terrorist [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]] (the "Blind Sheikh") to his followers in [[al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya]]. Judge [[John Koeltl]] sentenced to Stewart to ten years in prison, but on December 31, 2013, Koeltl ordered Stewart released from federal prison due to her terminal breast cancer. Koeltl cited the incurable nature of Stewart's disease and the "relatively limited risk" of recidivism and danger to the community upon release. She was 74 years old at the time of her release from the [[Federal Medical Center Carswell]] in Texas where she had been held, and had served just over four years of her sentence.&lt;ref name=ferrigno&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferrigno|first=Lorenzo|title=Dying defense lawyer Lynne Stewart released from jail|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/31/justice/lynne-stewart-compassionate-release/|accessdate=3 May 2014|publisher=CNN|date=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NY judge orders ‘compassionate release’ of terror lawyer Lynne Stewart|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/12/31/ny-judge-orders-compassionate-release-terror-lawyer-lynne-stewart/|accessdate=3 May 2014|publisher=Fox News|date=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart died in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P.

====Variation among states====
Different states have various policies on compassionate release system, varying on details such as the life expectancy required to warrant compassionate release.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3565">A '''continuation novel''' is a [[novel]] in the style of an established series, produced by a new author after the original author's death.&lt;ref&gt;"Poirot returns to the scene of the crime", [[Marcel Berlins]], ''[[The Times]]'', 8 September 2014, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuation novels may be official, produced with the permission of the late author's [[literary executor]]s, or unofficial where the original author's works are now out of [[copyright]].

==Official continuations==
Where official continuations are produced, the novel will normally try to keep closely to the style of the original author in order to preserve the integrity and value of the literary franchise and the author may be legally required to do so.

Examples of official continuations include the multiple authors that have continued [[Ian Fleming|Ian Fleming's]] [[James Bond]] series, including [[Kingsley Amis]], [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], [[Sebastian Faulks]] and others; and the 2014 [[Hercule Poirot]] continuation novel ''The Monogram Murders'' by [[Sophie Hannah]], produced with the permission of the [[Agatha Christie]] estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebookseller.com/news/global-campaign-christie-continuation-novel.html Global campaign for Christie continuation novel.] Joshua Farrington, ''The Bookseller'', 8 April 2014. Retrieved 12 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some versatile authors have contributed to more than one continuation series, for instance Sebastian Faulks who in addition to James Bond has written the first ever official [[P.G. Wodehouse]] [[Jeeves and Wooster]] story, ''Jeeves and the Wedding Bells'', published in 2013.&lt;ref name=Tel&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10421976/Bertie-Wooster-forced-me-to-cheer-up.html Bertie Wooster forced me to cheer up.] Sarah Rainey, ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 3 November 2013. Retrieved 12 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

If not done well, the continuation novel poses risks to the reputation of the dead author but writing one is also a risk for the new author as they are obliged to suppress their own style in favour of the style of an often better-known author and one whose fans may take convincing to accept the legitimacy of the new work. Faulks said of his Wodehouse continuation: "People said it was brave – or stupid. Either way, it was a ridiculous undertaking. PG Wodehouse is, by common consent, one of the great prose stylists of the 20th century. I didn’t want to make a mess of it."&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt;

If the continuation is a success however, it may lead to substantial sales and, just as importantly, revive interest in and sales of the works of the dead author. For this reason publishers will sometimes commission a continuation novel if they feel that interest in the original author is beginning to wane.

==Unofficial continuations==
Where the original works are out of copyright, however, the new author(s) are free to interpret the franchise in any way they wish. There are a large number of [[Sherlock Holmes]] continuations for instance which vary in quality and authenticity. Such unofficial continuations, which may overlap with [[fan fiction]] and [[pastiche]], may introduce completely new characters, change time periods, add or remove plot elements and make as many changes to the original formula as the author feels are useful.

The '''Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage, and Registration of Marriages''' was a treaty agreed upon in the [[United Nations]] on the standards of marriage. The treaty was opened for signature and ratification by General Assembly resolution 1763 A (XVII) on 7 November 1962 and entered into force 9 December 1964 by exchange of letters, in accordance with article 6. The Convention has been signed by 16 countries and there are 55 parties to the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVI-3&amp;chapter=16&amp;lang=en Status at 1/25/13]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention reaffirms the consensual nature of marriages and requires the parties to establish a [[Marriageable age|minimum marriage age]] by law and to ensure the [[registration of marriage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/convention.htm Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages - text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618135427/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/convention.htm |date=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corruption in Bulgaria''' has been a central problem of the country's government since the late 1990s, and fighting it has been at the top of the government's agenda. Despite that, [[Bulgaria]] has "systematically demonstrated very high levels of perception of corruption."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Government officials reportedly engage in embezzlement, influence trading, government procurement violations and bribery with impunity.&lt;ref name="SG1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sofiaglobe.com/2018/04/21/us-state-dept-criticises-bulgaria-on-prisons-judiciary-corruption-people-trafficking-and-violence-against-minorities/|title=US State Dept criticises Bulgaria on prisons, judiciary, corruption, people-trafficking and violence against minorities|publisher=''The Sofia Globe''|date=21 April 2018|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a January 27, 2016 report by [[Transparency International]], the country is considered the most corrupt member state of the [[European Union]] (which accepted Bulgaria as a member in 2007). The report is based on the polling of experts from around the world on topics such as a free press, integrity, and independent judiciaries. In 2015, the European Commission found that Bulgaria had done almost nothing to stem the tide of corruption and organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/justice/132012|title=Bulgaria seen as the most corrupt in EU|last=Nielsen|first=Nikola J.|date=2016-01-27|work=EU Observer|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll of Bulgarians indicated that 76 percent believe that political parties are corrupt and 86 percent believe that the judiciary is corrupt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 71st place out of 180 countries, and the most corrupt in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 [[Global Corruption Barometer]] indicated that 49 percent of respondents believed that the level of corruption remained the same in Bulgaria over the preceding two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/gcb2013/country/?country=bulgaria|title=Bulgaria 2013 - World's largest opinion survey on corruption - Transparency International|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corruption Perceptions Index ==
In the 2016 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], Bulgaria ranked 75th out of 176 countries (a score of 42 out of 100). The lower the number, the more perceived corruption exists in a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/country/BGR|title=Bulgaria|last=|first=|date=|website=Transparency International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the CPI, lower-ranked countries experience "untrustworthy and badly functioning public institutions like the police and judiciary."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2016|last=|first=|date=2017-01-25|work=Transparency International|newspaper=|access-date=2017-02-01|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, anti-corruption laws are ignored: "People frequently face situations of bribery and extortion, rely on basic services that have been undermined by the misappropriation of funds, and confront official indifference when seeking redress from authorities that are on the take."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Types of corruption ==

=== Lobbying ===
A 2014 study by Transparency International indicated that lobbying in Bulgaria is mainly unregulated and happens behind closed doors. "The report ''Lobbying in Bulgaria: Interests, Influence, Politics'' shows that there are significant deficits in the transparency, integrity and equality of access regarding influence over public decision-making in the country." The study used a framework from a project called "lifting the lid on lobbying", and Bulgaria received a "paltry overall score of only 25 percent." For transparency, Bulgaria received a score of 13 percent; for integrity, 25 percent, and free quality of access 38 percent. By 2014, four legislative proposals had been introduced in Bulgaria's parliament but none of the bills passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/bulgaria_opaque_relations_among_politics_and_business_undermine_trust_in_in|title=Bulgaria: Opaque Relations Among Politics And Business Undermine Trust In Institutions And Democracy|last=|first=|date=2014-12-16|website=Transparency International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vote-buying ===
During the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 parliamentary election]], Transparency International Bulgaria's telephone helpline received 202 complaints. One of the top three complaints concerned vote-buying.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/the_price_of_a_vote_in_a_bulgarian_pub|title=The Price of a Vote in a Bulgarian Pub|last=|first=|date=2015-06-09|newspaper=Transparency International|access-date=2017-02-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pub owner in a small village offered [[Romani people in Bulgaria|Roma]] voters {{US$|40|link=yes}} to $55 to vote a certain way, with the money paid only if the political party in question won.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some 480,000 illegally printed [[ballot]]s were discovered at a printing house in [[Kostinbrod]] the day before the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2013|May 2013 parliamentary election]]. The blank ballots might have been prepared to manipulate the vote. The owner of the printing house, a municipal councilor from [[GERB]], claimed that the ballots were technical spoilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.novinite.com/articles/151051/Bulgaria%27s+%27Fake+Vote+Ballots%27+Final+Count+Is+480+000|title=Bulgaria's 'Fake Vote Ballots' Final Count Is 480 000|publisher=Novinite|date=7 June 2013|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judiciary ===
The Bulgarian Supreme Judicial Council, responsible for personnel policy in the country's judiciary, has a high level of legislative autonomy. It has been involved in a number of scandals, suggesting that it has been subject to external influences on its decisions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/nisarticle/bulgaria_2011|title=National integrity system assessments - Bulgaria 2011|last=|first=|date=2012-03-01|website=Transparency International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the Council of Europe expressed concern about the lack of judicial independence and the compromised separation of powers in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=6828&amp;lang=2|title=PACE, worried about threats to the rule of law, points to recent developments in five states |publisher=Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|date= 12 October 2017|access-date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Venice Commission]] has raised concern about the Soviet model of Bulgaria's Prosecution which turns it into "a source of corruption and blackmail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/postponed-eu-monitoring-of-bulgaria-s-prosecution-worries-experts-05-31-2016/|title=Delayed EU Audit of Bulgaria Prosecution Raises Concern|publisher=''Balkan Insight''|date= 5 May 2016|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil activists have demanded the resignation of Bulgaria's General Prosecutor [[Sotir Tsatsarov]] for a long time due to his alleged involvement in high-profile corruption cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapool.bg/hristo-ivanov-ima-3-nesamneni-osnovaniya-za-momentalna-ostavka-na-tsatsarov-news262973.html/|title=Христо Иванов: Има 3 несъмнени основания за моментална оставка на Цацаров|publisher=mediapool.bg|date= 23 April 2017|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Public tenders ===
Government procurement is an area of significant corruption risk. Many of the public contracts are awarded to a few politically connected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stefanov |first1=Ruslan |title=The Bulgarian Public Procurement Market: Corruption Risks and Dynamics in the Construction Sector |journal=Government Favouritism in Europe: The Anticorruption Report 3 |date=2015 |issue=3/2015 |page=35 |url=http://www.romaniacurata.ro/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ACRVolume3_Ch3_Bulgaria.pdf |accessdate=6 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; companies amid widespread irregularities, procedure violations and tailor-made award criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/policy/how/improving-investment/public-procurement/study/country_profile/bg.pdf|title=Public procurement in Bulgaria|publisher=European Commission|date=2015|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ognyan Gerdzhikov]]'s interim government found widespread violations in defence procurement after it took over from the [[Second Borisov Government]] in 2017; 45 out of 82 defence ministry contracts signed the previous year were in breach of public procurement laws and regulations. Fraud was strongly suspected in nine of the procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-procurement-fraud-idUSKBN15W0UX|title=Bulgaria's new interim government finds many irregular defense contracts|publisher=Reuters|date=17 February 2017|accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public tenders in energy and infrastructure are particularly associated with alleged siphoning of funds from EU and state coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.export.gov/article?id=Bulgaria-Corruption|title=Corruption|publisher=[[International Trade Administration]]|accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An estimated 10 billion leva ($5.99 billion) of state budget and [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund|European cohesion]] funds are spent on public tenders each year;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.24chasa.bg/novini/article/5316312|title=10 млрд. лв. годишно се харчат с обществени поръчки|trans-title=10 bln. leva are spent on public procurement every year|publisher=''24 Chasa''|date=21 February 2016|accessdate=30 July 2018|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly 14 billion ($8.38 billion) were spent on public contracts in 2017 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.capital.bg/politika_i_ikonomika/bulgaria/2017/12/29/3104548_rekord_pri_obshtestvenite_poruchki_otkriti_sa_turgove/|title=Рекорд при обществените поръчки: открити са търгове за почти 14 млрд. лв.|trans-title=A record in public procurement: tenders worth nearly 14 billion lv unveiled|publisher=''Kapital Daily''|first=Ivaylo|last=Stanchev|date=29 December 2017|accessdate=16 July 2018|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bank runs and seizures ===
{{Main|Seizure of Bulgaria's Corpbank}}
In 2014, [[List of bank runs|bank runs]] on [[Corporate Commercial Bank]] and [[First Investment Bank]] "focused new attention on the fragile economy and dysfunctional politics that are hobbling Bulgaria."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The bank runs destabilized international investment and the business community's confidence in Bulgaria. The Corporate Commercial Bank run was provoked by its prosecution, and the bank was seized by the Bulgarian central bank. First Investment Bank remained open while Corporate Commercial Bank remained closed.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

== Effects ==
=== Economic mismanagement ===
Corruption has resulted in significant economic losses and underperformance in Bulgaria. Since its accession to the EU in 2007, it has remained the Union's poorest country with a per-capita GDP of $16,300, less than half the European average. By 2014, the Bulgarian government was accused of mismanaging the economy so badly that the European Union froze billions of euros in aid.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/business/international/bank-runs-in-bulgaria-expose-fragility-and-flaws.html|title=In Bulgaria, Corruption and Mistrust Turn Promise Into Pain|last=Ewing|first=Jack|date=2014-07-07|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-06|last2=Kantchev|first2=Georgi|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2008 and 2018, [[foreign direct investment]] collapsed, dropping from 28% to 2% of GDP, or $9 billion to just $1.13 billion.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.diplomaticourier.com/as-foreign-firms-flee-bulgaria-must-finally-curb-its-corruption-problem/|title=As Foreign Firms Flee, Bulgaria Must Finally Curb Its Corruption Problem|publisher=[[The Diplomatic Courier]]|first=Caroline|last=Holmund|date=27 September 2018|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabinets of [[Boyko Borisov]] have been in power through most of the decade, establishing a system of impunity for high-profile crime and favoritism of certain local companies. Approximately 22% of GDP are lost to corruption each year, and a number of major foreign companies, like [[ČEZ Group]], have withdrawn from Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="DC"/&gt;

=== Social unrest ===
Corruption is a source of profound public discontent.&lt;ref name="cloud"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/28/bulgaria-corruption-eu-presidency-far-right-minority-parties-concerns|title=Cloud of corruption hangs over Bulgaria as it takes up EU presidency|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Jennifer|last=Rankin|date=28 December 2017|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption and government inaction against convicted Roma criminal Kiril Rashkov sparked the [[2011 Bulgaria antiziganist protests|2011 anti-Roma riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-roma/sleepy-village-an-unlikely-spark-for-roma-protests-idUSTRE78T3E720110930|title=Sleepy village an unlikely spark for Roma protests|publisher=Reuters|date=30 September 2011|accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2013 Bulgarian protests against the first Borisov cabinet]] spread to over 30 cities and were marked by seven [[self-immolation]]s, five of which were fatal.&lt;ref name="BBC 05-04"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22039182|title=Bulgaria holds prayers to end suicides and despair|publisher=BBC News|date=5 April 2013|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests, directed against corruption, poverty and political parties, led to the resignation of the [[First Borisov Government]].&lt;ref name="AJ 21-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/02/201322163943882279.html|title=Protests in Bulgaria and the new practice of democracy|publisher=Al-Jazeera English|date=21 February 2013|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2013–14 Bulgarian protests against the Oresharski cabinet|Mass demonstrations continued]] against the government of [[Plamen Oresharski]], which also resigned following the appointment of [[Delyan Peevski]] as head of the [[State Agency for National Security]].&lt;ref name='reuters14'&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/14/us-bulgaria-government-idUSBRE95D0ML20130614 |title=Bulgarians protests over media magnate as security chief |last1=Tsolova |first1=Tsvetelina |last2= |first2= |date= 14 June 2013|work=reuters.com |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another wave of demonstrations occurred in November 2018 against low wages, as well as fuel price and vehicle tax hikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sofiaglobe.com/2018/11/18/damp-day-of-protests-in-sofia-other-bulgarian-cities/|title=Damp day of protests in Sofia, other Bulgarian cities|publisher=The Sofia Globe|date=18 November 2018|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 20 cities saw protests demanding the resignation of the [[Third Borisov Government]]; several major roads were blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-protests/thousands-protest-in-bulgaria-against-high-fuel-prices-car-taxes-idUSKCN1NG0P5|title=Thousands protest in Bulgaria against high fuel prices, car taxes|publisher=Reuters|date=11 November 2018|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deterioration of media freedom ===
According to [[Reporters Without Borders]], the press industry in Bulgaria is rife with "corruption and collusion between media, politicians, and oligarchs".&lt;ref name="Euractiv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/media4eu/news/reporters-face-obstacle-run-in-corruption-hit-bulgaria/|title=Reporters face obstacle run in corruption-hit Bulgaria|publisher=Euractiv|date=23 February 2018|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media ownership is opaque, intransparent and concentrated in the hands of a few owners, despite a superficial diversity in ownership. Upon joining the European Union in 2007, Bulgaria ranked 35th on the [[Press Freedom Index]], alongside [[France]].&lt;ref name="Euractiv"/&gt; It has since tumbled to 111th, by far the worst press freedom performer of any EU member and candidate state. More than 90% of Bulgarian journalists, as polled by the [[Association of European Journalists]], have reported frequent interference with their work. Lawmakers have gone as far as threatening TV journalists with sacking during a live broadcast.&lt;ref name="Euractiv"/&gt; The media environment has been further degraded by EU funds diverted by the government to sympathetic media outlets.&lt;ref name="RSF"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsf.org/en/bulgaria|title=Bulgaria|publisher=[[Reporters Without Borders]]|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/sep/23/press-freedom-bulgaria|title=Why Bulgaria is the EU's lowest ranked country on press freedom index|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Roy|last=Greenslade|date=23 September 2014|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, two journalists were detained and later released by police while investigating a massive scheme to drain EU funds by a company associated with a number of high-profile government procurement projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediapool.bg/pm-boyko-borissov-orders-the-removal-of-officials-named-in-bivol-investigative-reporting-about-massive-eu-funds-corruption-sch-news284136.html|title=PM Boyko Borisov orders the removal of officials named in Bivol investigative reporting about massive EU funds corruption scheme|publisher=Mediapool|date=21 September 2018|accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baltimore, Maryland]], U.S. is infamous for its very high crime rate, including a violent crime rate that ranks high above the national average. Violent crime spiked in 2015 after the [[death of Freddie Gray]] on April 19, 2015, which touched off riots and an increase in murders. The city recorded a total of 344 homicides in 2015, a number second only to the number recorded in 1993 when the population was 100,000 higher.  

== Crime statistics ==
In 2011, [[Baltimore]] police reported 196 homicides, the lowest number since recording 197 homicides in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2012/01/01/baltimore-sees-lowest-homicide-count-since-1978 |title=Baltimore Sees Lowest Homicide Count Since 1978 |date=January 1, 2012|publisher=[[WJZ-TV]] |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-01-01/news/bs-md-ci-year-end-crime-20120101_1_killings-violent-crime-deadly-cities |title=Baltimore has fewer than 200 killings for first time in decades |date=January 1, 2012 |publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That number is far lower than the peak homicide count of 353 in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-11-11/news/1994315031_1_eastern-district-homicide-rate-police-report |title=46 slayings in 41 days push homicide rate up |date=November 11, 1994 |publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drop in 2011 was significant, when measured by the number of homicides, but the homicide rate was in the same range as the late 1980s when the city population was 130,000 higher. City leaders credited their sustained focus on repeat violent offenders and an increased community engagement for the continued drop, reflecting a nationwide decline in crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2012/01/01/baltimore-sees-lowest-homicide-count-since-1978 |title=Baltimore Sees Lowest Homicide Count Since 1978 |date=January 1, 2012 |publisher=[[WJZ-TV]] |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baltimore's decline was short-lived, as a reported 219 and 235 homicides were committed in 2012 and 2013, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citiesjournal.com/baltimore-passes-curfew-for-youth |title=Baltimore Passes Curfew For Youth |publisher=CitiesJournal.com |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/07/baltimore-homicides_n_4233569.html |title=Baltimore Marks 200th Homicide Of 2013 |date=November 7, 2013 |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baltimore's jump in homicides in 2013 defied regional and national trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.baltimorebrew.com/2014/01/02/baltimores-jump-in-homicides-in-2013-defies-national-trends |title=Baltimore’s jump in homicides in 2013 defies national trends |date=January 2, 2014 |publisher=[[Baltimore Brew]] |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bal-new-fbi-statistics-baltimore-no-5-in-murder-rate-20141110-story.html |title=New FBI statistics: Baltimore No. 5 in murder rate |date=November 10, 2014 |publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in ''The Guardian'', on November 2, 2017,&lt;ref&gt;Gately, Gary (November 2, 2017). [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/02/baltimore-murder-rate-homicides-ceasefire "Baltimore is more murderous than Chicago. Can anyone save the city from itself?"] ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Simon]], himself a former ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' police reporter, ascribed the most recent surge in murders to the high-profile decision by Baltimore state’s attorney, Marilyn Mosby, to charge six city police officers following the death of Freddie Gray after he fell into a coma while in police custody in April 2015. “What Mosby basically did was send a message to the Baltimore police department: ‘I’m going to put you in jail for making a bad arrest.’ So officers figured it out: ‘I can go to jail for making the wrong arrest, so I’m not getting out of my car to clear a corner,’ and that’s exactly what happened post-Freddie Gray.” In Baltimore arrest numbers have plummeted from more than 40,000 in 2014, the year before Freddie Gray’s death and the subsequent charges against the officers, to about 18,000 in 2017 (primo November). This happened even as homicides soared from 211 in 2014 to 344 in 2015 – an increase of 63%.&lt;ref&gt;Gately, Gary (November 2, 2017).

Baltimore's level of violent crime is much higher than the national average. In 2009, a total of 1,318,398 violent crimes were reported nationwide across the United States, equivalent to a rate of 0.4 incidents per 100 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/State/RunCrimeOneYearofData.cfm|title=Estimated crime in 2009|publisher=FBI Uniform Crime Reporting|accessdate=March 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110427022028/http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/State/RunCrimeOneYearofData.cfm| archivedate= April 27, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
Homicides in Baltimore are heavily concentrated within a small number of high-poverty neighborhoods. According to a ''Baltimore Sun'' investigation, around 80% of the city's gun homicides are committed in 25% of the city's neighborhoods. For the past few years, the rate of lethal shootings has been increasing in Baltimore and at least 10 other cities, such as Washington, D.C.; Chicago; and Milwaukee. {{as of|2016|In 2016}}, the Coldstream Homestead Montebello neighborhood in Northeast Baltimore was the city's most lethal neighborhood, with an average of one out of every two shootings being fatal; the citywide average is one in three.&lt;ref name=George&gt;{{cite news|last1=George|first1=Justin|title=Some Baltimore neighborhoods condemned to endure a shocking degree of violence|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bal-shoot-to-kill-part-two-story.html|accessdate=January 22, 2017|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gang-related crimes are usually clustered in drug territories and mostly affect people involved in drug dealing, particularly narcotics, and rival gangs. Sometimes as part of a gang initiation, recruits are expected to rob people who are not involved in drug trafficking, such as in tourist areas and Baltimore's wealthier neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=Sentementes&gt;{{cite web | title=Gang problem hemorrhaging | url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bal-mezz3-gen3-test,0,4937470.story|first1=Gus G.|last1=Sentementes|first2=Annie|last2=Linskey|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=April 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore]] is one of West Baltimore's most blighted and problematic communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Outrage mingled with fear: Community responds after children, 2 and 3, are shot | url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2008-06-11/news/0806100292_1_brave-warwick-apartments-bealefeld|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=June 11, 2008|author=Nick Madigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 20th century, Sandtown experienced economic depression, housing abandonment, crime, and [[Baltimore riot of 1968|racial rioting in 1968]].&lt;ref name="Live in Baltimore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebaltimore.com/neighborhoods/list/sandtownwinchester/|title=Sandtown-Winchester|work=Live in Baltimore|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandtown-Winchester was also the home of Freddie Gray and the scene of his arrest. Following his death, the area was hard hit by riots including the looting and burning of a CVS drug store off the north-east corner of Sandtown-Winchester at the intersection of Pennsylvania and W. North Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/04/freddie-gray-neighborhood-wickham-column/26834967/ |title=Wickham: Focus on Freddie Gray's neighborhood|accessdate=November 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the area was once considered middle-class, [[Berea, Baltimore|Berea]] has in the last century experienced economic depression, housing abandonment, crime, and [[Baltimore riot of 1968|racial rioting]]. Its residents are largely lower income [[African American]]s. The neighborhood served as a filming location for the Baltimore-based [[Home Box Office|HBO]] television drama, ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]''.

== Policing ==
{{Main|Baltimore Police Department}}

The Baltimore Police Department is staffed by nearly 4,000 [[civilian]] and sworn personnel. These include [[dispatcher]]s, crime lab technicians, [[chaplain]]s and unarmed [[auxiliary police]] officers. During [[Martin O'Malley]]'s administration as mayor, the department had become 43% African American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Black police officers claim discrimination within Baltimore department | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002111604_webbaltimore07}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}, The Seattle Times (December 7, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the FBI identified irregularities in the number of rapes reported, which was confirmed by then-Mayor Martin O'Malley. The number of homicides in 2005 appeared to exhibit discrepancies as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Homicide Rate, Police Procedures Questioned | url=http://www.thewbalchannel.com/news/7056945/detail.html | access-date=2012-11-13 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323083654/http://www.thewbalchannel.com/news/7056945/detail.html# | archive-date=2006-03-23 | dead-url=yes | df= }}, WBAL-TV (February 14, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Former police commissioner [[Kevin P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21383">[[File:Fate of the World Ingame.png|thumb|right|An in-game screenshot from ''[[Fate of the World]]'', a global warming game]]

A '''global warming game''', also known as a '''climate game''' or a '''climate change game''', is a type of [[serious game]]. As a serious game, it attempts to simulate and explore real life issues to educate players through an interactive experience. The issues particular to a global warming [[video game]] are usually [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and the implementation of [[green technology]] as ways to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and thus counteract [[global warming]]. Global warming games also include more traditional [[board game]]s, [[video game]]s, as well as other varieties.

== Objectives ==

The primary objectives of global warming games are twofold:

#To develop the player's familiarity and knowledge of the issue of global warming and related issues
#To make the player aware of the challenges and obstacles that are faced when addressing global warming
#Occasionally, the games encourage players to develop ideas and solutions to global warming

The first objective is universal to global warming games. The issues surrounding global warming commonly included are [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] emissions and the emission of other [[greenhouse gases]], the melting of the [[polar ice cap]]s, [[sea-level rise]], [[natural disasters]] and massive changes to lifestyles caused by global warming. Games that do not go beyond the objective of knowledge and familiarity tend to be designed for younger audiences. Games designed for young children often only have the goal to engage the children enough to excite their attention to focus on these basic concepts.

The second objective is integrated into games in a variety of ways. Sometimes demonstrating the challenges of confronting global warming are put directly into the style of gameplay, e.g. to demonstrate the difficulty of international cooperation, players are made to represent different countries and are required to negotiate to fulfill game objectives. Other times, the game includes the challenges as a part of the mechanics, e.g. building 'green factories' is more expensive than building 'black factories.'

The final objective is shared by the most interactive and engaging global warming games. Developing solutions to global warming includes two major types of response: [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]] of [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]] and [[global warming|global warming's]] effects, and [[adaptation]] to live [[sustainable development|sustainably]] in a new [[climate change|climate]]. Typically players are given a variety of different options so that they may come up with a number of different creative solutions. Sometimes players are even allowed freedom to create their own unique options to integrate into their strategy.

The participant's goal in DCCS is to maintain the carbon dioxide concentration stock within an acceptable range around the goal value of 938 GtC. The participant decides on emissions of two different types: deforestation and burning of fossil fuels. The participant sets the fossil fuel and deforestation emissions. The DCCS moves autonomously by a number of time steps to a future year and calculates carbon dioxide concentrations and absorptions from making the emissions. The software is available to download for free to academics, subject to the attached license agreement.

=== LogiCity ===
LogiCity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logicity.co.uk/game LogiCity]&lt;/ref&gt; is an interactive Flash-based virtual-reality based computer game, produced by Logicom and The [[National Energy Foundation]], an English [[Charitable organization|charity]]. The game is set in a 3D virtual city with five main activities where players are set the task of reducing the [[carbon footprint]] of an average resident.  The activities comprise:
* a race against time around a virtual reality office switching off equipment left on by careless users;
* finding and selecting [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[renewable energy]] options in a home, but with a strictly limited budget;
* answering a quiz about features they  have to find in a low energy building;
* taking part in a role playing game to select the best travel options for three generations of a family; and
* choosing a holiday from a virtual travel agents - but with the risk that climate change may have led to unexpected changes at the destination.

As players work their way through the game they attempt to cut their [[carbon footprint]] from a typical English figure of 5.5 tonnes to a level of 2.0 tonnes.  At the end of the game they are taken forward to 2066 to see if they have done enough to save England from the worst problems associated with global [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;See interview with Dr Majid Al-Kader, New Scientist video on YouTube{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-jTsSf8_S0 |title=Climate Change in a Virtual World |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game's conclusion and focus on 2066 is designed to bring home to players the reality of the changes they may face in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.logicity.co.uk |title=LogiCity: Will You Survive? |publisher=[[National Energy Foundation]] |accessdate=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is part of Defra’s ([[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]) Climate Challenge programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatechallenge.gov.uk/whats_being_done/projects/logicity/default.aspx|title=Climate Challenge Project|publisher=[[DEFRA]]|accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase public awareness of Climate Change across the country.  The [[National Energy Foundation]], Logicom and [[Centrica|British Gas]] also provided support to the game's development. ''LogiCity'' is designed to be used both by individuals and in an educational context. It is stated to be suitable for most children from the ages of 10 or 11 upward (English KS3+), although the main target group is young adults aged 16–26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blog/technology/2007/11/climate-change-in-virtual-world.html|title=Climate change in a virtual world|author=Simonite, Tom|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|date=2007-11-15|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game can either be played [[online]] or distributed across a network from a [[CD-ROM]].  There are no licensing implications as it has been publicly funded, although all PCs being used for the game do need to meet certain technical requirements (notably being PCs not Macs, and using [[Internet Explorer]] as a browser), and may require additional software plug-ins to be downloaded (a [[VRML]] viewer and a recent version of [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] player).

There has been some criticism that the game is only really applicable to [[England]], due to limitations imposed by its funders, so that it is unlikely to appeal widely in North America.  The look and feel of the game concentrates on a near photo-realism for buildings, but the player is disembodied and lacks an [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]].  [[Firefox]] users are unable to run the game unless they switch to [[Internet Explorer]], and some users have commented that download times for each module can be up to a minute, although this may be overcome by using the [[CD-ROM]] implementation. Logicity was also made available via a cover disk on [[PC Gamer]] magazine.

=== Stabilization Wedge Game ===
{{main|Stabilization Wedge Game}}
The ''Stabilization Wedge Game'', or what is commonly referred to as simply the 'Wedge Game', is a [[serious game]] produced by [[Princeton University|Princeton University's]] [http://cmi.princeton.edu/ Carbon Mitigation Initiative]. The goal of the game creators, Stephen Pacala and Robert H. Socolow, is to demonstrate through this game that [[global warming]] is a problem which can be solved by implementing today's technologies to reduce {{CO2}} emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/305/5686/968?ijkey=Y58LIjdWjMPsw&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci | title=Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies | last=Pacala and Socolow| first=Stephen and Robert | publisher=[[Science (journal)|''Science'']] | date=2004-08-13 |accessdate=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the game is to keep the next fifty years of {{CO2}} emissions flat, using seven wedges from a variety of different strategies which fit into the stabilization triangle.

=== Climate Challenge ===
{{main|Climate Challenge}}
''Climate Challenge'' is a Flash-based simulation game produced by the BBC and developed by [[Red Redemption Ltd]]. Players manage the economy and resources of the 'European Nations' as its president, while reducing emissions of {{CO2}} to combat climate change and managing crises. Climate Challenge is an environmental serious game, designed to give players an understanding of the science behind climate change, as well as the options available to policy makers and the difficulties in their implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/hottopics/climatechange/climate_challenge/aboutgame.shtml |title=Climate Challenge |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Climate Change Game ===
The Climate Change Game is played by one or two people (sharing the Mouse). Each player is the leader of his/her country, hoping to be re-elected while trying to cope with the [[Effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] and, hopefully, reverse it.
You'll make Decisions to change the energies you use or use them in a different way, researching topic in the Glossary. You'll also answer Questions on Climate Change and respond to Natural Events (such as volcanic eruptions) which affect Climate, People's Choices (unpredictable, popular human actions which impact Greenhouse Gas emissions and tax revenues), and economic or political decisions by other countries that affect the level of greenhouse gas emissions.
You win “The Climate Change Game” – and your delighted citizens re-elect you - if you can help reduce global Greenhouse Gas emissions to the level required by the Kyoto Protocol AND are not spending more money than people pay in taxes, AND maintain Voter Support of at least 51 percent AND Earth’s Temperature is “comfortable" for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environmental-education-games.com/climate-change-game.html |title=The Climate Change Game |publisher=Environmental Education Games |accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== V GAS ===
{{main|V GAS}}
''V GAS'' is a 3D [[serious game]] in which players explore and live in a house that is built to mirror their own. Players begin the game by building a profile including variables such as water use and transportation behaviors, heating and cooling practices, food purchases, and electrical appliance usage. Once the profile has been built, the player can begin the simulation which introduces different scenarios ranging from heat waves to mad cow disease. The player adjusts their lifestyle according to how they would react to these events in real life. All the while, the players' decisions are being measured and recorded, and their overall contribution to [[Nitrous oxide|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]], [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]], and [[methane|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] to the [[atmosphere]] is measured.

=== Keep Cool ===
{{main|Keep Cool (board game)}}
''Keep Cool'' is a [[board game]] created by Klaus Eisenack and Gerhard Petschel-Held of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and published by the [[Germany|German]] company [[Spieltrieb]] in November 2004. The game can be classified as both a [[serious game]] and a global warming game. In Keep Cool, up to six players representing the world's countries compete to balance their own economic interests and the world's [[climate]] in a game of [[negotiation]]. The goal of the game as stated by the authors is to "promote the general knowledge on climate change and the understanding of difficulties and obstacles, and "to make it available for a board game and still retain the major elements and processes."&lt;ref name="keep cool"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiel-keep-cool.de/|title= The Authors: Science and Games |author= Eisenack, Klaus|author2=Petschel-Held, Gerhard |accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Winds of Change ===
The [[European Climate Forum]] and [[Munich Re]] have launched a climate game called Winds of Change, which is a [[board game]] for 2-4 persons. The game illustrates the climate challenge in a playful way and it can be used in team learning, schools, focus groups, etc. It includes several features, which are hotly debated in climate policy-making. These include among others: investments in R&amp;D, technological learning and innovation, de-carbonizing the economy, ocean uptake of {{CO2}}, the 2 degrees limit, and insurance against [[extreme weather]] events.

=== Climate-Poker ===
Berlin-based Andrea Meyer, game designer with an environmental background published this card game in her company [[BeWitched-Spiele]] in 2009. Playing the [[card game]] for 2-4 persons ages 12 and up takes 30–40 minutes. The game has players collect groups of like-minded countries in order to hold conferences. The bigger the conference the better. Country cards show indicators on {{CO2}}-emissions per capita as well as figures on consequences of [[extreme weather]] events (deaths and damages). While no knowledge is needed to play the game, players will learn a bit about who is causing climate change and who is suffering from it. On the game side, Climate-Poker requires bluffing and closely watching what the other players are aiming at. the 2 degrees limit, and insurance against. The figures in the game stem from the World Resources Institutes' Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT) and from [[Munich Re]].

=== CEO2 - Climate Business Game ===
The online climate game [http://www.ceo2-game.com CEO2] from [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Allianz]] is a rather complex simulation that allows one player to run a company over a period of 20 years. Players can choose from four industries (automobile, chemicals, insurance, utility). They have a limited budget and can choose from a variety of business decision like investing in smart grids or [[carbon capture and storage]] (utility). Their target is to reduce CO2 emissions significantly until 2030 without going bankrupt. Advisors (environmentalist, investors, researcher) offer help but their suggestions can be one-sided. The game is based on the RECIPE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.allianz.com/nopi_downloads/downloads/RECIPE_synthesis_report.pdf|title=RECIPE - The Economics of Decarbonization|author1=Ottmar Edenhofer |author2=Carlo Carraro |author3=Jean-Charles Hourcade |author4=Karsten Neuhoff |publisher=[[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]]|accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; study from the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]].

=== Fate of the World ===
{{main|Fate of the World}}
''Fate of the World'' is a 2011 [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS]] game developed and published by [[Red Redemption]], the developers of ''Climate Challenge''.  It focuses on global governance, with goals ranging from improving living conditions in [[Africa]], to preventing catastrophic [[climate change]], to exacerbating it.  It is based around an intricate model of populations, economic production and greenhouse emissions based on real-world data.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fateoftheworld.net |title=Fate of the World: Real Science.

=== Plantville ===
Plantville&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantville.com/index.php]&lt;/ref&gt; is "an innovative, educational and fun way for Siemens to engage customers, employees, prospects, students and the general public while driving awareness of [[Siemens]] technologies and brand." The game enables players to improve the health of their plants by learning about and applying industrial and infrastructure products and solutions from [[Siemens]]. Gamers will be measured on a number of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including safety, on time delivery, quality, energy management and employee satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Siemens"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buildingtechnologies.siemens.com/bt/us/Press/press_release/2011/Pages/SiemensLaunchesPlantville.aspx |title=Siemens Launches Plantville — An Innovative Gaming Platform to Showcase Products and Solutions for Industry and Infrastructure |author=Siemens |date=24 March 2011 |work= |publisher=[[Siemens]] |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Xbox 360 Games for Change Challenge ==
The [[Xbox 360]] Games for Change Challenge is a collaborative effort between [[Microsoft]] and [[Games for Change]] (G4C), a subgroup of the [[Serious Games Initiative]]. The challenge is a worldwide competition to develop a global warming game with [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] [[XNA Game Studio Express]] software. Winners will be awarded scholarships from [[Games for Change]] and [[Microsoft]], and the winning games will have the possibility of being available for download on the [[Xbox LIVE Arcade]] service. The Xbox 360 Games for Change Challenge has been cast by Microsoft as a "socially-minded" initiative, joining the larger [[serious games]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/0611-gamesforchangechallenge.htm |title=Xbox 360 Games for Change Challenge |publisher=Microsoft |date=2007-06-11 |accessdate=2007-07-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717151211/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/0611-gamesforchangechallenge.htm |archivedate=2007-07-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzanne Seggerman, a co-founder of [[Games for Change]], shared these comments in a radio interview:
{{cquote|Think about how this next generation of kids could be inspired to be environmentalists and humanitarians. You know I'd like to see also, a thousand little game seeds planted. Not all the games are going to get prizes and not even that many are going to get recognized. But think of this new generation of game-makers and game innovators we're reaching. All these kids who've perhaps never even considered the impact of the environment are going to be getting knee deep in environmental issues. That's really exciting. You know kids really respond to this medium of video games in a way they don't to a newspaper or a heavy documentary. And I think that's the key. It's that we're reaching them on their own turf.|source=Suzanne Seggerman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.htm?programID=07-P13-00025&amp;segmentID=3 |title=Global Warming Games|publisher=[[Living on Earth]]|last=Gellerman|first=Bruce|date=2007-06-22|accessdate=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''GroundReport''' was a [[citizen journalism]] website that enabled contributors to publish news reports and videos. The site was owned by a nonprofit organization called Open News Platform until mid-2017. Since the site did not attract enough donations and advertisement revenue to sustain it, Open News Platform sold the GroundReport.com domain and platform to Search-Ladder, LLC in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.groundreport.com/groundreport-will-shut-april-30-2017/ |title=GroundReport Will Shut Down April 30, 2017 |date=April 3, 2017 |website=GroundReport.com |publisher=Open News Platform |access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Search-Ladder is a [[digital marketing]] agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.groundreport.com/about-us/ |title=About Us |website=GroundReport.com |publisher=Search-Ladder |access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was completed in May 2017.

==Beginnings==
Journalist [[Rachel Sterne]] started GroundReport.com in 2006. She wanted to make such a site after her experience reporting on [[Darfur]] as an intern at the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=America's Most Promising Social Entrepreneurs |url=http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/04/0403_social_entrepreneurs/11.htm |accessdate=24 June 2011 |newspaper=Businessweek |date=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifra-nt.com/website/ntwebsite.nsf/0/17EF43E4572AA8F9C125730F00574CE2?OpenDocument&amp;1&amp;G&amp;MIMPAL-74LADF Q&amp;A with Rachel Sterne, GroundReport]&lt;/ref&gt; To run GroundReport, Sterne started Open News Platform, a not-for-profit [[501(c)(3) organization]] incorporated in [[New York (state)|New York]]. In 2008, she Sterne expressed a wish to expand GroundReport with regional editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/video/#/video/news/2008/09/03/news.groundreport.090308.cnnmoney CNNMoney: Blogging for Profit]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' named Sterne one of "America's Most Promising Social Entrepreneurs".&lt;ref&gt;http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/04/0403_social_entrepreneurs/11.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
GroundReport used a Wikipedia-like model of volunteer editors and community feedback, combined with a star rating system. Contributors chose from a range of [[Creative Commons]] licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7610 CC citizen journalism site GroundReport re-launches; GroundReport TV launches officially - Creative Commons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 17, 2008, select contributors were given the ability to revise content in any article.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.groundreport.com/Media_and_Tech/GroundReport&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, GroundReport implemented a vetting system that requires review and approval of every contributor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/idealab/2009/06/citizen-journalism-networks-stepping-up-editorial-standards158.html MediaShift: Citizen Journalism Networks Stepping Up Editorial Standards]&lt;/ref&gt; GroundReport has a strict copyright policy and distributed vetting system. Contributors who plagiarized or posted copyright-infringing material were banned from the site.

Among the news stories covered by GroundReport's contributors were the [[United States presidential election of 2008]], the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]], the [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests]], and the aftermath of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].

According to ''[[Adweek]]'', GroundReport received 29,187 unique visitors in December 2010, down from 60,802 monthly unique visitors earlier that year. The ''Adweek'' journalist commented: "Even during major events, GroundReport's influence was very small. As the [[BBC News]] reported in an article on Dec. 1, 2008, following terror attacks in Mumbai that had been covered on the site, 'it is worth noting that the original story on the GroundReport Web site has attracted fewer than 200 viewers so far, whereas untold millions have watched television reports in India and around the world.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who and What Is Rachel Sterne?|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/who-and-what-rachel-sterne-125536|accessdate=24 June 2011|newspaper=[[Adweek]]|date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; GroundReport's content was syndicated to [[Google News]].

In July 2015, volunteers from Injustice Anywhere began to help with restructuring, and a redesign of GroundReport.com launched on September 22, 2015.

===Video===
In June 2008, GroundReport started using the [[YouTube]] API for its on-demand video publishing. Shortly thereafter, GroundReport became an official partner channel, and a flagship participant in their newly launched 'reporter' category. Among YouTube's official Beijing Olympics content partners,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/ytsummergames&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]] and ''[[The New York Times]],'' GroundReport was the only citizen news source.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/blog?entry=Wg4IWnSeXMo YouTube: Beijing from all angles]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the livestreaming space, GroundReport is a featured flagship channel on broadcast platform [[Livestream]]. GroundReport's live video coverage of the Democratic Debates, [[Aspen Institute]] and panel discussions with leaders like [[Arianna Huffington]] and [[Madeleine Albright]] has been featured on ''[[HuffPost|Huffington Post]],'' ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]],'' ''Silicon Alley Insider'' and [[TechCrunch]].

Rachel Dubrofsky and Megan W.

Carmen Van Kerckhove coined the term ''hipster racism'' in the article "The 10 Biggest Race and Pop Culture Trends of 2006", citing "Kill Whitey" Parties and "Blackface Jesus" as examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Van Kerckhove |first=Carmen |date=15 January 2007 |title=The 10 Biggest Race and Pop Culture Trends of 2006: Part 1 of 3 |url=http://www.racialicious.com/2007/01/15/the-10-biggest-race-and-pop-culture-trends-of-2006-part-1-of-3/ |website=Racialicious |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302044555/http://www.racialicious.com/2007/01/15/the-10-biggest-race-and-pop-culture-trends-of-2006-part-1-of-3/ |archive-date=2 March 2013 |access-date=12 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnm |1a1=Current |1a2=Tillotson |1p=4 |2a1=Threadgold |2y=2018}} "Kill Whitey" parties, as described by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', were parties held for [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], by Jeremy Parker, a [[disc jockey]] who goes by the name The Pumpsta, in an attempt to "kill the whiteness inside". These were parties in which white [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] mocked the black [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] industry, and essentially a part of [[African-American culture]], for the sake of irony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Garcia |first=Michelle |date=26 August 2005 |title=Deejay's Appeal: 'Kill The Whiteness Inside' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/25/AR2005082501818.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Kerckhove also regarded the use of blackface by [[white people]] and the [[normalization (sociology)|normalization]] and acceptance of such use from other individuals as hipster racism. Van Kerckhove contends, quoting Debra Dickerson, that the use of blackface by individuals such as these was an effort to satirize [[political correctness]] and racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Van Kerckhove |first=Carmen |date=9 December 2005 |title=Dude, Where's My White Privilege?

Matt Pearce of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' characterized the appropriation of [[cultural artifact]]s as fashion without recognizing the significance of the article as hipster racism. Examples include wearing [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[headdress]]es, or more specifically, [[Urban Outfitters]] selling clothes with [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] and other Aboriginal and African tribal prints without giving tribute, acknowledgement, or compensation.&lt;ref name="Pearce 2012"/&gt;  Television producer [[Lena Dunham]] was described as a hipster racist when Dunham issued a statement defending a male colleague who was accused of rape by a woman of mixed race. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=D'Zurilla | first=Christie | date=20 November 2017 | title=Lena Dunham accused of 'hipster racism' after she initially defended 'Girls' writer | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-lena-dunham-accused-of-hipster-racism-1511203068-htmlstory.html | access-date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Mahdawi | first=Arwa | date=25 November 2017 | title=Is Lena Dunham's 'hipster racism' just old-fashioned prejudice? | work=[[The Guardian]] | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/25/hipster-racism-lena-dunham-prejudice | access-date=25 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hot and Hot Fish Club''', also known as '''Hot and Hot Fish Club of All Saints Parish,''' was a [[gentlemen's club]] in the 19th century in [[South Carolina]] dedicated to [[:wikt:epicurean|epicurean]] pursuits: [[gourmet|gourmet foods]], [[Alcoholic beverage|strong drinks]] and [[festival|festive times]].&lt;ref&gt;"Booklet", p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; It started after the [[American Revolutionary War]] (early 19th century) and ended during the [[American Civil War]] (1864–65).&lt;ref name="Booklet15"&gt;"Booklet", p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harwell1947"&gt;{{harvnb|Harwell|1947|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/27571912 JSTOR Harwell article]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Robert Francis Withers Allston]], ex-governor of South Carolina in the 19th century, writes at the beginning of the ''Rules and History of the Hot and Hot Fish Club'' booklet that he recalls as a boy of fifteen in 1816 that he would visit his older married sister (Elizabeth) in [[Murrells Inlet, South Carolina|Murrells Inlet]] near [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. Her husband (John H. Tucker) was a [[Sportsperson|sportsman]] that would hunt deer and fish in the nearby [[Waccamaw River]]. When Allston visited he always enjoyed "club day", which was Friday during the summer months. On that day he would fish with Mr. Tucker.&lt;ref&gt;"Booklet", p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the Fish Club then, as Allston remembers, were

[[File:Depiction of two fishing 1860.JPG|thumb|Depiction of [[Robert Francis Withers Allston]] fishing with John H. Tucker]]
&lt;br /&gt;
All these above were Allston's close friends. It was rumored that John Green could eat a ''peck of fish'' during this meal. He would put the fish into one side of his mouth and at the same time spit out the bones of the previous fish from the other side. The exaggerated rumor went on that all the while he would ''drink a quart of brandy!''&lt;ref name="Booklet7"&gt;"Booklet", p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
He was known to say with a [[Southern American English|southern accent]]:

&lt;center&gt;
{{poemquote|
Fish and rice
is very nice;
Pork and 'tater
Is much better.&lt;ref name="Booklet7"/&gt;
}}&lt;/center&gt;

== Main Event ==

The main dinner consisted of beef, ham, [[Game (food)|local game]] and rice - besides the catch of the day!  It was an elaborate [[potluck]], where each member would catch enough to contribute to the dinner and for his boat hands.&lt;ref name="Booklett6"/&gt; Each member also was to bring some kind of side dish (i.e. bread, salad, pudding) for distribution among the other attending members.&lt;ref name="Booklett6"/&gt; The fish caught for the day's event were [[Bass (fish)|bass]], [[Sheepshead (Archosargus)|sheephead]], [[hogfish]] and varieties of [[panfish]].&lt;ref name="Booklett6"/&gt;

The main meal for the day's social event was served sometime after 1 in the afternoon. At that time the President of the social club would raise a flag that signaled the fishing boats to come in.  When the boats arrived they would survey the fish caught, discuss the variety, and give a description of the catch to the gathered crowd. The prized catch was the hogfish of North Carolina and Virginia.&lt;ref name="Booklett6"&gt;"Booklet", p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fish cleaning ===
The boat hands that were elected to clean the fish had a procedure to follow. They were

{{quote|... to wash the fish in three waters, the last to be fresh.&lt;ref name="Booklett6"/&gt; }}

They would use these fish caught for meals at the Fish Club that day. After the cleaning of the first set of fish caught, the [[fishing boat]]s were put back into the nearby stream and continued fishing. They would arrive back then later, one by one, to deliver whatever choice fish they caught meanwhile. They were in turn cleaned and prepared for the main event meal that was commencing. Often the best fish came in last and those that knew this saved their [[palate]]s for these later fish in the second course that were "hot and hot."&lt;ref name="Booklet7"/&gt;

== Location ==
In 1816 the "club-house" was located within fifty feet of the [[inlet|inlet waters]] on the north end of "Drunken Jack", a [[Stunt (botany)|stunted tree]] island on Murrells inlet at the southern area of [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. The first club house was damaged during a storm, so was rebuilt on the mainland. Major Ward (member in 1816) had salt vats on a section of a "clam-bank" land area, where the second one was built. Once the new expanded club house opened up there were a set of new members added. At this time the future South Carolina governor, Robert Francis Withers Allston, had joined the club. John Walter Phillips was an honorary member.&lt;ref name="Booklet7"/&gt;

A third "club-house" was at the residence of Dr. Post. The doctor later converted this area to a church. The Club was then set up in a temporary "wall tent" furnished by General J. W. Allston. Later a fourth permanent club house was built on the main land at the causeway owned by Dr. Hasell. Additional members then were Dr. William Magill, Dr. William A. Norris, and occasionally John Izard Middleton, Dr. Andrew, Dr. B.B. Smith, and John Ashe Alston. Several years later on September twenty-seventh 1822 this clubhouse was washed away. At this time a grant of about ten acres was given by Col. T. Pinckney, at "B. F. Dunkin's Midway plantation" (named because it was halfway between Horry county line and the tip of the peninsula).&lt;ref name="Rogers269"&gt;Rogers, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;  It was near a convenient crossing place between Wachesaw and Fraser's Point. Here a comfortable two room clubhouse was built by the members as the fifth and final permanent structure. It had a fireplace with an excellent chimney. Also the clubhouse had an attached ten-pin bowling alley, a billiard table, and a race course.&lt;ref name="Rogers269"/&gt; The built-in kitchen was adequate to cook all the fish necessary for all the members on their yearly feasts. Joshua John Ward, son of Major Ward, donated a billiard table for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;"Booklet", p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
It was in this fifth and last clubhouse that a set of Rules was developed by the members. The membership at that time was fifty dollars.&lt;ref name="Booklet9"&gt;"Booklet", p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The roll of living members that signed and adhered to a written set of rules developed in 1845 are below. The purpose of the Club was stated as being for ''"convival and social intercourse."''&lt;ref name="Harwell1947"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers269"/&gt; The members that joined the Fish Club later after its founding in the early 19th century to the American Civil War were generally sons or relatives of the original members.&lt;ref name="Booklet15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human trafficking in the Gambia''' covers ongoing activities in [[Trafficking in human beings|trafficking]] women and children in [[the Gambia]] as [[forced labor]] and [[prostitution]].

The Gambia is a source, transit, and destination country for this type of exploitation. Within the Gambia, women and girls and, to a lesser extent, boys are trafficked for [[commercial sexual exploitation]], as well as for [[domestic servitude]]. For generations, parents sent their sons to live with [[Koranic]] teachers or [[marabouts]], who more often forced children to beg than ensured their progress in religious studies. However, this practice is declining as the security forces now routinely interrogate the marabout of any [[beggar]] they find in the streets. Some observers noted only a small number of trafficking victims, but others see the Gambia's porous borders as an active transit zone for women, girls, and boys from [[West African]] countries – mainly [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea Bissau]], and [[Benin]] – who are recruited for exploitation in the [[sex trade]], in particular to meet the demands of European tourists seeking sex with children. Most trafficking offenders in the Gambia are probably individuals who operate independently of international syndicates. The government's Department of Social Welfare and Tourism Security Unit are compiling electronic databases and conventional lists of trafficking cases, offenders, and victims, which may soon provide a clearer picture of how traffickers operate and how they differ from the migrant smugglers whose cases are now filling the country's courts.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The [[Government of the Gambia]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of [[Human trafficking|trafficking]]; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. At the highest level, the government acknowledges that trafficking exists in the country. The Gambian government lacks funding and resources to fight trafficking, though it continued to monitor and evaluate the trafficking problem in the country. Every law enforcement agency has anti-trafficking or [[child protection]] units. In July 2009, the government took an important step to increase efficiency in law enforcement by adopting a [[biometric]] national identity card system called GAMBIS.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"The Gambia".

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2 Watchlist"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of the Gambia demonstrated limited progress in its [[anti-human trafficking]] law enforcement efforts, resulting in one conviction of a trafficking offender during the reporting period. The Gambia prohibits all forms of trafficking through its October 2007 Trafficking in Persons Act. The law does not differentiate between sexual exploitation and [[labor exploitation]], and prescribes penalties of from 15 years' to life imprisonment, penalties which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The Gambia's 2005 Children's Act also prohibits all forms of child trafficking, prescribing a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. In July 2009, a [[Banjul]] court convicted a Gambian man of trafficking two children and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment. In June 2009, authorities investigated reports that a group of girls from Ghana had been trafficked to a fishing settlement called "Ghana Town" for exploitation in prostitution. An interagency team of investigators visited the site and found the reports to be inaccurate. The government did not provide specialized anti-trafficking training for law enforcement and immigration officials during the reporting period.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The government improved its victim protection efforts during the reporting period. It did not undertake proactive efforts to identify foreign trafficking victims. The government continued to operate a 24-hour shelter, made up of three units with accommodations for 48 victims. The shelter did not receive any trafficked children during 2009. The government maintained and funded a 24-hour hotline number that directly connected callers with two dedicated officers of the Department of Social Welfare. The line was created as a family assistance tool, but was also advertised as an available resource for victims of trafficking. The government maintained a drop-in center for street children, including victims of trafficking, and it provided both the shelter and the drop-in center with an annual budget of about $11,500, in addition to contributions from [[UNICEF]] and a faith-based NGO. The government also provided food, medical care, and counseling to all trafficking victims, whether nationals or foreigners. Victims could obtain emergency temporary residence visas under the Trafficking in Persons Act, though none did so during the year.

The government did not identify or assist with the repatriation of any Gambian victims of transnational trafficking during the year. Under the law, however, repatriated nationals were eligible for government-provided care and rehabilitation measures. Gambian authorities identified at least three people that were trafficking victims during the reporting period – two young girls, whose trafficker was prosecuted and imprisoned in July 2009, and a Nigerian girl who reported her trafficking plight to the Child Protection Alliance and the Police Child Welfare Officer in October. The two children were returned to their parents, but the Nigerian girl disappeared. There was no formal system for proactively identifying victims of trafficking, but law enforcement and border control officers who were alert to trafficking situations more intensively questioned adults who arrived at the border with children. There were not enough active trafficking cases to make an assessment about respect for victims' rights, but if trafficking was suspected or identified, Social Welfare would likely have interceded and no victim would have been prosecuted or fined.

Training conducted throughout the year attempted to give security officers the ability to identify and assist potential trafficking victims. There was only one reported case of a victim assisting the authorities in investigation. The government undertook efforts to train and further educate officials in recognizing human trafficking situations and victims. During the year, the government designated officers within each major police station to be responsible for assisting and counseling any potential trafficking victims. However, the government provided no information on such training for Gambian embassies and consulates in foreign countries.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Government of the Gambia sustained moderate efforts to prevent trafficking through awareness-raising during the reporting period. The government previously supported anti-trafficking and information campaigns, most conducted by [[NGO]]s, but reported few such campaigns in 2009. Government-controlled media continued to publicize the dangers of trafficking. There was no comprehensive analysis of emigration and immigration patterns for evidence of trafficking. In December 2009, the government dissolved its multiagency National Task Force for Combating Trafficking in Persons and allocated approximately $111,000 to finance the establishment of the new National Agency to Combat Trafficking in Persons, which was designated to implement the national anti-trafficking plan of action. The government's Tourism Security Unit (TSU) effectively patrolled the Tourism Development Area – the zone most frequented by tourists – to combat child sex tourism and reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. The TSU continued to enforce a 2005 ban on unattended children visiting the tourist resort areas and remitted them to the custody of the Department of Social Welfare. Police sometimes arrested persons suspected of engaging in prostitution. However, these measures were not strong deterrents, and reflected the common perception that prostitution was meeting the needs of tourists who drove a major part of the country's economy. In March 2009, the government convicted a [[New Zealand]] national of child pornography and sentenced him to one year's imprisonment; he was acquitted of child defilement charges. Child sex tourism was a problem in the Gambia, but the authorities did not report any prosecution or convictions of child sex tourists during the reporting period. The Gambian government provided its troops with antihuman trafficking training, including warnings against committing any immoral behavior that may bring their force into disrepute, prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

[[File:Indian dyes (2009)a.jpg|thumb|Kumkum powder from Mysore, India.]]
'''Kumkuma'''  is a powder used for social and religious markings in [[India]]. It is made from [[turmeric]] or any other local materials. The turmeric is dried and powdered with a bit of [[slaked lime]], which turns the rich yellow powder into a red color. Recently, the CDC has identified this as a major source of lead poisoning in children.

In India, it is known by many names including ''kuṅkumam'' ([[Sanskrit]] कुङ्कुमम्), ''kumkuma'' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]] కుంకుమ), ''kunku'' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]] कुंकू), ''kumkum'' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]] কুমকুম, [[Hindi language|Hindi]] कुमकुम), ''kunkuma'' ([[Kannada]] ಕುಂಕುಮ), ''kungkumam'' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]] குங்குமம்), and ''kungkumam'' ([[Malayalam]] കുങ്കുമം).

==Application==
Kumkuma is most often applied by Indians to the forehead. The reason has to do with the ancient Indian belief that "the human body is divided into seven vortices of energy, called [[chakras]], beginning at the base of the spine and ending at the top of the head. The [[sixth chakra]], also known as the [[third eye]], is centered in the forehead directly between the eyebrows and is believed to be the channel through which humankind opens spiritually to the Divine".&lt;ref name= Huyler)&gt;Huyler, Steven. "The Experience: Approaching God". In ''The Life of Indians'', ed. Vasudha Narayanan and John Stratton Hawley. Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the kumkuma is placed where Indians believe to be the most important spot for receptivity to be enhanced.

==Common forehead marks==
*Shaivites: Followers of Shiva usually apply three white horizontal lines with a dot of kumkuma at the center.&lt;ref name="Huyler)"/&gt;
*Vaishnavas: Followers of Vishnu make use of "white clay to apply two vertical lines joined at the base and intersected by a bright red streak." Many times the clay is applied in a U-shape.&lt;ref name="Huyler)"/&gt;
*Swaminarayana: Followers of the Swaminarayan faith apply kumkuma at the center of the forehead and between a U-shaped tilaka. The tilaka is normally yellow and made from sandalwood.&lt;ref name= Mukund)&gt;Sadhu Mukundcharandas. ''Indian Rites and Rituals''. First edition. Amdavad: Swaminarayana Aksharpitha, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chandrakor: Many Maharashtrians - men, women, and children alike - wear it traditionally in the shape of crescent moon.

==Significance==
In the Vaishnava tradition, the "white lines represent the footprint of their God, while the red refers to his consort, Lakshmi".&lt;ref name="Huyler)"/&gt; The Swaminarayana tradition holds that the tilaka (yellow U-shaped mark) "is a symbol of the lotus feet of Paramatma," and the kumkuma "represents the bhakta" (devotee).&lt;ref name="Mukund)"/&gt; In both of these traditions, the forehead mark serves as a reminder that a devotee of God should always remain as a servant at the feet of God.

The 'color' of the womb is yellow and is symbolically represented by turmeric. The blood stains on the womb is represented by kumkuma. It is believed that the combination of turmeric and kumkuma represents prosperity.{{reference needed|date=November 2017}}

==Kumkuma and women==
When a girl or a married woman visits a house, it is a sign of respect (in case of an elderly lady) or [[blessing]]s (in case of a girl) to offer kumkuma to them when they leave. However, it is not offered to widows.

When visiting a temple, married women from southern India usually dip their ring finger in yellow turmeric powder and apply a dot on their forehead. Men, women, girls, and boys also apply a dot on their forehead of red turmeric powder, when visiting a temple or during a [[Puja (Hinduism)|pooja]]. Kumkuma at temples is found in heaps. People dip their thumb into the heap and apply it on the forehead or between the eyebrows.

In most of India, married women apply red kumkuma to the parting of their hair above their forehead every day as a symbol of marriage. This is called vermilion, or in Hindi, ''[[sindoor]]''.  In southern India, many unmarried girls wear a [[bindi (decoration)|bindi]] every day unlike northern India where it is only worn as a symbol of marriage.

==Making kumkuma==
Kumkum is made from turmeric by adding limestone and is an [[Ayurvedic]] facial material along with turmeric.
&lt;!-- This paragraph contradicts itself: "No saffron is sold for use as kumkum; saffron is extremely costly. It gives an orangey-yellow dye, not the bright red of commercial kumkum. Saffron for kumkuma is made from the flower ''[[Crocus sativus]]'', in the family [[Iridaceae]]. The plant has many names in [[Sanskrit]]: Ghusruna, Rakta, Kashmira, Balhika, Kesara, Kashmiraja, Kumkuma, Agneeshekhara, Asrugvara, Shatha, Shonita, Pitaka, or Rudhira. The saffron contains a dye consisting of 8% to 13.4% of the [[volatile oils]] [[crocin]] and [[picrococin]]." --&gt;

==Other uses==
[[File:Holi celebrations, Pushkar, Rajasthan.jpg|right|thumb|Holi celebrations, [[Pushkar]], [[Rajasthan]].]]
Kumkuma is also widely used for worshiping the [[Hindu]] goddesses, especially [[Shakti]] and [[Lakshmi]], and a kumkuma powder is thrown (along with other mixtures) into the air during [[Holi]] (the Festival of Colours), a popular Hindu spring festival.

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official language of [[Guatemala]]. As a first and second language, Spanish is spoken by 93% of the population. [[Guatemalan Spanish]] is the local variant of the Spanish language.

Twenty-one [[Mayan languages]] are spoken, especially in rural areas, as well as two non-Mayan [[Amerindian]] languages, [[Xincan languages|Xinca]], an indigenous language, and [[Garifuna language|Garifuna]], an [[Arawakan]] language spoken on the Caribbean coast. According to the Language Law of 2003, the languages of Mayas, Xincas, and Garifunas are unrecognized as National Languages.&lt;ref name=Decreto19-2003&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 10, 2007 |url=http://www.oj.gob.gt/es/QueEsOJ/EstructuraOJ/UnidadesAdministrativas/CentroAnalisisDocumentacionJudicial/cds/CDs%20leyes/2003/Leyes%20en%20PDF/Decretos%202003/Decreto%2019-2003.pdf |title=Ley de Idiomas Nacionales, Decreto Número 19-2003 |format=PDF |language=Spanish |publisher=El Congreso de la República de Guatemala |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235237/http://www.oj.gob.gt/es/QueEsOJ/EstructuraOJ/UnidadesAdministrativas/CentroAnalisisDocumentacionJudicial/cds/CDs%20leyes/2003/Leyes%20en%20PDF/Decretos%202003/Decreto%2019-2003.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Guatemalan Civil War|peace accords]] signed in December 1996 provide for the translation of some official documents and voting materials into several indigenous languages (see summary of main substantive accords) and mandate the provision of interpreters in legal cases for non-Spanish speakers. The accord also sanctioned bilingual education in Spanish and indigenous languages. It is common for indigenous Guatemalans to learn or speak between two and five of the nation's other languages, and Spanish.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

A '''meeting system''' is any systemic means of improving [[meeting]]s, [[workshop]]s or [[business conference|conferences]].  They are particularly important in [[consensus decision making]] and [[deliberative democracy]], but they have always been recognized as important to [[judicial procedure]] and [[parliamentary procedure]], down to the level of the [[town meeting]] or below.

There are many such systems, of which one of the best-known is probably [[Robert's Rules of Order]], which is applied in parliamentary debate and corporate meetings in many English-speaking countries.  Also well-known is the [[cross-examination debate]] applied in both [[criminal law]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]]. Much innovation in meeting systems has come from objection to these two basic models, notably because both reflect an [[adversarial process]].

When used in political or economic contexts, meeting systems are very often associated with a [[voting system]].  When used in [[matchmaking]] or other sexual/romantic contexts, a meeting system is considered a [[Dating#Matchmaking systems and services|dating system]].  These are discussed in other articles.

[[File:Royal Harp Badge of Ireland.svg|thumb|Ancient Royal Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland, as first employed by the monarchs of the [[Kingdom of England]].]]
A monarchical system of government existed in [[Ireland]] from ancient times until—for what became the [[Republic of Ireland]]—the early twentieth century. [[Northern Ireland]], as part of the [[United Kingdom]], remains under a monarchical system of government. The [[Gaelic kingdoms of Ireland]] ended with the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], when the kingdom became a [[fief]] of the [[Holy See]] under the Lordship of the [[King of England]]. This lasted until the [[Parliament of Ireland]] conferred the crown of Ireland upon [[King Henry VIII of England]] during the [[English Reformation]]. The monarch of England held the crowns of England and Ireland in a personal union. The [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603 expanded the personal union to include [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. The personal union between England and Scotland became a political union with the enactments of the [[Acts of Union 1707]], which created the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The crowns of Great Britain and Ireland remained in personal union until it was ended by the [[Acts of Union 1800]], which united Ireland and Great Britain into the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] from January 1801 until December 1922.

After that date, most of Ireland left the United Kingdom to become the largely independent [[Irish Free State]], a [[dominion]] within the [[British Empire]]; the remaining part, [[Northern Ireland]], elected to remain in the United Kingdom. Both the Free State and the United Kingdom, which changed its name to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] in 1927, had the same person as monarch: [[George V]]. In 1937, the year after George V's death, the Free State adopted a [[Constitution of Ireland|new constitution]] which changed the state's name to ''Ireland'' (or ''[[Éire]]'') and removed all mention of the monarch. In April 1949, ''Ireland'' was declared a republic, with the description of the ''[[Republic of Ireland]]'', and it left the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Since April 1949, the only part of the island of Ireland that has retained a monarchical system is [[Northern Ireland]] (as part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland).

==Gaelic kingdoms==

Gaelic Ireland consisted of as few as five and as many as nine Primary kingdoms (Cuaighe) which were often subdivided into many minor smaller kingdoms (Tutha). The primary kingdoms were [[Ailech]], [[Airgíalla]], [[Connacht]], [[Leinster]], [[Mide]], [[Osraige]], [[Munster]], [[Thomond]] and [[Ulster]]. Until the end of Gaelic Ireland they continued to fluctuate, expand and contract in size, as well as dissolving entirely or being amalgamated into new entities. The role of [[High King of Ireland]] was primarily titular and rarely (if ever) absolute. Gaelic Ireland was not ruled as a [[unitary state]].

[[File:Ireland900.png|thumb|Map of Ireland (900 AD)]]

The names of Connacht, Ulster, Leinster and Munster are still in use, now applied to the four modern provinces of Ireland. The following is a list of the main Irish kingdoms and their kings.

*[[Kings of Ailech]] (5th century to 1185)
*[[Kings of Airgíalla]] (    –1590)
*[[Kings of Connacht]] (406–1474)
*[[Kings of Leinster]] (634 to 1603 or 1632 (de facto))
*[[Kings of Mide]] (8th–12th centuries)
*[[Kings of Osraige]] (    –12th century)
*[[Kings of Munster]] (4th century to 1138 or 1194 (claimant))
*[[Kings of Thomond]] (1118–1543)
*[[Kings of Ulster]] (5th–12th centuries)

===''Ard Rí co febressa'': High Kings with opposition===
{{main|High Kings of Ireland}}
Maire Herbert has noted that "Annal evidence from the late eighth century in Ireland suggests that the larger provincial kingships were already accruing power at the expense of smaller political units. Leading kings appear in public roles at church-state proclamations...and at royal conferences with their peers." (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;62). Responding to the assumption of the title ''ri hErenn uile'' ("king of all Ireland") by Mael Sechlainn I in 862, she furthermore states that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
the ninth-century assumption of the title of "ri Erenn" was a first step towards the definition of a national kingship and a territorially-based Irish realm. Yet change only gained ground after the stranglehold of Uí Néill power-structures was broken in the eleventh century. ...The renaming of a kingship ... engendered a new self-perception which shaped the future definition of a kingdom and of its subjects.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; (Herbert, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;72)

Nevertheless, the achievements of Mael Sechlainn and his successors were purely personal, and open to destruction upon their deaths.  Between 846–1022, and again from 1042–1166, kings from the leading Irish kingdoms made greater attempts to compel the rest of the island's populace to their rule, with varying degrees of success, until the inauguration of [[Ruaidri Ua Conchobair]] (Rory O'Connor) in 1166,

====Ruaidhrí, King of Ireland====
[[File:Rory O'Connor Stone Carving.jpg|thumb|[[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]]]]
Upon the death of [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]] in early 1166, Ruaidhrí, [[King of Connacht]], proceeded to [[Dublin]] where he was inaugurated ''King of Ireland'' without opposition. He was arguably the first undisputed full king of Ireland. He was also the only Gaelic one, as the events of the Norman invasion of 1169–1171 brought about the destruction of the high-kingship, and the direct involvement of the [[Kings of England]] in Irish politics.

One of Ruaidrí's first acts as King was the conquest of [[Leinster]], which resulted in the exile of its king, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]]. Ruaidrí then obtained terms and hostages from all the notable kings and lords. He then celebrated the Oneach Tailtann, a recognised prerogative of the High Kings, and made a number of notable charitable gifts and donations. However, his ''[[caput]]'' remained in his home territory in central Connacht ([[County Galway]]). Ireland's recognised capital, [[Dublin]], was ruled by [[Ascall mac Ragnaill]], who had submitted to Ruaidri.

Only with the arrival of MacMurrough's [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] allies in May 1169 did Ruaidrí's position begin to weaken. A series of disastrous defeats and ill-judged treaties lost him much of [[Leinster]], and encouraged uprisings by rebel lords. By the time of the arrival of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1171, Ruaidrí's position as king of Ireland was increasingly untenable.

Ruaidrí at first remained aloof from engagement with King Henry, though many of the lesser kings and lords welcomed his arrival as they wished to see him curb the territorial gains made by his vassals. Through the intercession of [[Lorcán Ua Tuathail]] (Laurence O'Toole), the [[Archbishop of Dublin]], Ruaidrí and Henry came to terms with the [[Treaty of Windsor 1175|Treaty of Windsor]] in 1175. Ruaidrí agreed to recognise Henry as his lord; in return, Ruaidrí was allowed to keep all Ireland as his personal kingdom outside the petty kingdoms of [[Laigin]] (Leinster) and [[Kingdom of Mide|Mide]] as well as the city of [[Waterford]].

Henry was unwilling or unable to enforce the terms of the treaty on his barons in Ireland, who continued to gain territory in Ireland. A low point came in 1177 with a successful raid into the heart of [[Connacht]] by a party of [[Anglo-Normans]], led by one of Ruaidrí's sons, Prince Muirchertach. They were expelled, Ruaidhrí ordering the blinding of Muirchertach, but over the next six years his rule was increasingly diminished by internal dynastic conflict and external attacks. Finally, in 1183, he abdicated.

He was twice briefly returned to power in 1185 and 1189, but even within his home kingdom of Connacht he had become politically marginalized. He lived quietly on his estates, and died at the [[Cong Abbey|monastery of Cong]] in 1198 and was buried at [[Clonmacnoise]]. With the possible exception of [[Brian Ua Néill]] (Brian O'Neill; died 1260), no other [[Gaelic people|Gaelic]] king was ever again recognised as king or high king of Ireland.

==Lordship of Ireland: 1198–1542==

{{Main|Lordship of Ireland}}

By the time of Ruairi's death in 1198, King [[Henry II of England]] had [[Norman invasion of Ireland|invaded Ireland]] and given the part of it he controlled to his son [[John of England|John]] as a Lordship when John was just 10 in 1177. When John succeeded to the English throne in 1199, he remained Lord of Ireland thereby bringing the kingdom of England and the lordship of Ireland into [[personal union]]. By the mid-13th century, while the island was nominally ruled by the king of England, from c.1260 the effective area of control began to recede. As various [[Cambro-Norman]] noble families died out in the male line, the [[Gaelic nobility of Ireland|Gaelic nobility]] began to reclaim lost territory. Successive English kings did little to stem the tide, instead using Ireland to draw upon men and supplies in the wars in [[Scotland]] and France.

By the 1390s the Lordship had effectively shrunk to [[the Pale]] with the rest of the island under the control of independent Gaelic-Irish or rebel Cambro-Norman noble families. King [[Richard II of England]] made two journeys to Ireland during his reign to rectify the situation; as a direct result of his second visit in 1399 he lost his throne to [[Henry Bolingbroke]]. This was the last time that a medieval king of England visited Ireland.

For the duration of the 15th century, royal power in Ireland was weak, the country being dominated by the various clans and dynasties of Gaelic ([[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neill]], [[O'Brien dynasty|O'Brien]], [[MacCarthy dynasty|MacCarthy]]) or Cambro-Norman ([[House of Burke|Burke]], [[FitzGerald dynasty|FitzGerald]], [[Butler dynasty|Butler]]) origin.

==Kingdom of Ireland: 1542–1800==

===Re-creation of title===

{{Main|Kingdom of Ireland}}

[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger, Around 1497-1543 - Portrait of Henry VIII of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Henry VIII claimed the title "King of Ireland" in 1542.]]

The title "King of Ireland" was created by an act of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] in 1541, replacing the [[Lordship of Ireland]], which had existed since 1171, with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. The [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]] established a [[personal union]] between the English and Irish crowns, providing that whoever was King of England was to be King of Ireland as well, and so its first holder was [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII of England]]. Henry's sixth and last wife, [[Catherine Parr|Katherine Parr]], was the first Queen consort of Ireland following her marriage to King Henry in 1543.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Parr, editor, Janel Mueller. ''Katherine Parr: Complete Works and Correspondence'', University of Chicago Press, 2011. pg 178. ''Last Will and Testament of Dowager Queen Katherine Parr''&lt;/ref&gt; This followed the failure of the plan to make [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset|The 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset]] (1519–1536), Henry VIII's illegitimate son, into the King of Ireland. Although Richmond was made [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], the King's counsellors feared that creating a separate Kingdom of Ireland, with a ruler other than that of England, would create another threat like the [[King of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Scarisbrick, ''English Monarchs: Henry VIII'', University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of King of Ireland was created after Henry VIII had been excommunicated in 1538, so it was not recognised by European Catholic monarchs. Following the accession of the Catholic [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in 1553 and her marriage to [[Philip II of Spain]], in 1554, [[Pope Paul IV]] issued the [[papal bull]] "Ilius" in 1555, recognising them as Queen and King of Ireland together with her heirs and successors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/ireland_docs.htm#bull1555 The papal bull "ILIUS" of 1555 conferring the title of King of Ireland upon Philip II]&lt;/ref&gt;

For a brief period in the 17th century, during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] from the impeachment and execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649 to the [[Restoration (Ireland)|Irish Restoration]] in May 1660, there was no 'King of Ireland'. After the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], [[Irish Catholics]], organised in [[Confederate Ireland]], still recognised Charles I, and later [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], as legitimate monarchs, in opposition to the claims of the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]], and signed a formal treaty with Charles I in 1648. But in 1649, the [[Rump Parliament]], victorious in the [[English Civil War]], executed Charles I, and made England a republic, or "[[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]". The Parliamentarian general [[Oliver Cromwell]] came across the [[Irish Sea]] to crush the Irish royalists, temporarily uniting England, Scotland, and Ireland under one government, and styling himself "[[Lord Protector]]" of the three kingdoms. (''See also [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]''.) After Cromwell's death in 1658, his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] emerged as the leader of this pan-[[British Isles]] republic, but he was not competent to maintain it. The [[Parliament of England]] at [[Westminster]] voted to restore the monarchy, and in 1660 King Charles II returned from exile in France to become King of England, King of Scotland and King of Ireland.

===Union with Great Britain===
{{See also|List of British monarchs}}
The [[Acts of Union 1707]] merged the kingdoms of England and Scotland into the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], under the sovereignty of the [[British Crown]]. The effect was to create a personal union between the Crown of Ireland and the British Crown, instead of the English Crown. Later, from 1 January 1801, an additional merger took place between the two Kingdoms. By the terms of the [[Acts of Union 1800]], the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] merged with the Kingdom of Great Britain, thus creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Following the separation of most of Ireland from that kingdom in 1922, the remaining constituent parts were renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927, five years after the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]].

===Partition: Irish Free State and Northern Ireland (1922–1936)===
{{Main|Monarchy in the Irish Free State}}

[[File:Leinster House - 1911.jpg|left|thumb|[[Leinster House]], Dublin, decorated for the visit of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1911.&lt;br /&gt;Within a decade it was the seat of the [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State]].]]
In early December 1922, most of [[Ireland]] (twenty-six of the country's thirty-two [[Counties of Ireland|counties]]) left the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. These '[[Twenty-Six Counties]]' now became the [[Irish Free State]], a self-governing [[dominion]] within the [[British Empire]]. Six of Ireland's north-eastern counties, all within the [[Provinces of Ireland|Province]] of [[Ulster]], remained within the United Kingdom as [[Northern Ireland]]. As a Dominion, the Free State was a [[constitutional monarchy]] with the British monarch as its [[head of state]]. The monarch was officially represented in the new Free State by the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]].

The King's title in the Irish Free State was exactly the same as it was elsewhere in the [[British Empire]], being from 1922 to 1927: "[[By the Grace of God]], of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]], [[Emperor of India]]" and, from 1927 to 1937: "By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India". The change in the King's title was effected under an Act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] called the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927]], intended to update the name of the United Kingdom as well as the King's title to reflect the fact that most of the [[island of Ireland]] had left the United Kingdom. The Act therefore provided that "Parliament shall hereafter be known as and styled the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland [instead of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]" and "In every Act passed and public document issued after the passing of this Act the expression 'United Kingdom' shall, unless the context otherwise requires, mean Great Britain and Northern Ireland."&lt;ref name="The Times, March 4, 1927"&gt;The Times, 4 March 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Times]]'', the "[[Imperial Conference]] proposed that, as a result of the establishment of the Irish Free State, the title of the King should be changed to 'George V, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland, and the British Dominions beyond the seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India.'"&lt;ref name="The Times, March 4, 1927"/&gt; The change did not mean that the King had now assumed different [[Style of the British Sovereign|styles]] in the different parts of his Empire. That development did not formally occur until 1953, four years after the new [[Republic of Ireland]] had left the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].

Despite a lack of change in his title, George V's position as king of that country became separated from his place as King of the United Kingdom (as occurred with all the other British Dominions at the time). The [[Government of the Irish Free State]] (also known as [[His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State]]) was confident that the relationship of these independent countries under the Crown would function as a [[personal union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v9n3/cox93.html| journal=Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law| date=September 2002| title=Black v Chrétien: Suing a Minister of the Crown for Abuse of Power, Misfeasance in Public Office and Negligence| volume=9| issue=3| accessdate=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abdication crisis, President of Ireland and Republic of Ireland Act (1936–1949)===

{{Main|Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949}}

The constitutional crisis resulting from the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication of King Edward VIII]] in December 1936 was used by [[Éamon de Valera]]'s government as a catalyst to amend the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] by eliminating all but one of the King's official duties. This was achieved with the enactment on 11 December of the [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act]], which removed the monarch from the constitution and, on 12 December, the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Edward VIII| author-link=Edward VIII| publication-date=12 December 1936| title=Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936| publication-place=Dublin| publisher=Irish Statute Book| id=3.2| url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1936/en/act/pub/0058/sec0003.html#zza58y1936s3| accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provided that the monarch recognised by Britain and the rest of the Commonwealth could represent the Irish Free State "for the purposes of the appointment of diplomatic and consular representatives and the conclusion of international agreements" when authorised to do so by the Irish government. The following year, a new [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]] was ratified, changing the name of the Free State to [[Éire]], or "Ireland" in the English language, and establishing the office of [[President of Ireland]]. The King's role in Ireland was ambiguous. Whether the [[Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949]] was [[George VI]], or the President, was left unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Republicans and Imperialists: Anglo-Irish Relations in the 1930's  |last=McMahon |first=Deirdre |year=1984|isbn=0300030711 |page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the words of {{cite journal|author=Mary E.

The president of Ireland was the head of state. When opposition deputies asked de Valera whether Ireland was a republic—a favorite pastime in the mid-1940s—he tended to resort to dictionary definitions showing that Ireland had all the attributes of a republic."&lt;/ref&gt; This ambiguity was eliminated with the enactment of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]], which came into force in April 1949 and declared the state to be a republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1948/en/act/pub/0022/sec0001.html#zza22y1948s2 Section 1] of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]].&lt;/ref&gt; The External Relations Act was repealed, removing the remaining duties of the monarch, and Ireland formally withdrew from the [[British Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Atsushi |last1=Kondō |title=Citizenship in a Global World: Comparing Citizenship Rights for Aliens |publisher=Palgrave |location=Hampshire |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-80265-9 |page=120 |quote=Ireland reluctantly remained a member of the Commonwealth as Irish citizens remained British Subjects. However, Irish representatives stopped attending Commonwealth meetings in 1937 and Ireland adopted a position of neutrality in World War II. Ireland became a Republic in 1949 and formally left the Commonwealth. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the King in the Irish state was finally and formally ended by the [[Oireachtas]] with the repeal of the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]] by the [[Statute Law Revision (Pre-Union Irish Statutes) Act 1962]].

The [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]], specifically, continued and continues in [[Northern Ireland]], which remains a part of the sovereign state that is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. From 1921 until 1973, the British monarch was officially represented in Northern Ireland by the [[Governor of Northern Ireland]].

===List of monarchs of Ireland===

====Monarchs of Ireland====

[[File:Philip &amp; Mary Irish groat 602446.jpg|thumb|right|An Irish [[Groat (coin)|groat]] depicting Philip and Mary]]

* [[Lady Jane Grey]] (1553; disputed)
* [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] (1553–58)
** [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] ''[[jure uxoris]]'' (1554–58); his role as King of Ireland was reinforced by the [[Treason Act 1554]]
* [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603)
* [[James I of England|James I]] (1603–25)
* [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1625–49)

The [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (incorporating the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], [[Confederate Ireland]], the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] and the [[Irish Confederate Wars]]) took place between 1639 and 1651. Charles I was executed in 1649 and his son [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was recognised by some Irish lords as King of Ireland. The [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] began with England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales ruled by the [[English Council of State|Council of State]], then the [[Lord Protector]] [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1649–58) and his son [[Richard Cromwell]] (1658–59). The [[Restoration (Ireland)|Restoration in Ireland]] was effected in 1660 without major opposition, Charles II being declared King on 14 May 1660 by the [[Irish Convention (1660)|Irish Convention]].

* [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1660–85)
* [[James II of England|James II]] (1685–89)
* [[William III of England|William III]] (1689–1702) &amp; [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] (1689–94)

The position of King of Ireland was contested by William III and James II between 1689 and 1691, after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. The [[Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689]] made William King of Ireland, and this was reinforced by his victory at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] (part of the [[Williamite War in Ireland]]).

* [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] (1702–14)
**The [[Acts of Union 1707]] united the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland]] to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. However, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] remained a separate state.
* [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] (1714–27)
* [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] (1727–60)
* [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] (1760–1800)
The [[Acts of Union 1800]], instituted in reaction to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], created the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].

====Monarchs of the Irish Free State and Ireland====

[[File:Royal arms of Ireland.svg|thumb|right|upright|The royal arms of Ireland – Badge of Ireland, used during the period of the Kingdom of Ireland on coins, etc.]]
* [[George V]] (1922–1936) (The Irish Free State became a self-governing [[Dominion]] of the British Empire and subsequently, in 1931, a legislatively independent country)
* [[Edward VIII]] (1936)
* Arguably [[George VI]] (1936–1949), whose status was [[Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949|diminished]]

====Monarchs of the United Kingdom====
* [[George V]] (1922–1936)
* [[Edward VIII]] (1936)
* [[George VI]] (1936–1952) (Following the [[Ireland Act 1949]], only that part of Ireland known as [[Northern Ireland]] remained part of a monarchy.)
* [[Elizabeth II]] (1952–present)

====King's title, George I – George VI====

The king's title in the [[Irish Free State]], when it became a self-governing [[Dominion]] of the British Empire, and its constitutional successor from December 1936 to April 1949, was the same as elsewhere in the British Commonwealth,&lt;ref&gt;Proclamation altering the Style and Titles appertaining to the Crown, London, 13 May 1927.[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/britstyles.htm#1927]&lt;/ref&gt; but it was unclear whether the [[President of Ireland]] was [[Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949]] or the King, George VI.

The changes in the [[Style of the British Sovereign|royal style]] in the 20th century took into account the emergence of independence for the dominions from the [[Imperial Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The kings successively and their advisers and governments in the United Kingdom were fully aware that the republican intent of the representatives of the Irish Free State was in marked contrast to the intent of the governments of certain other dominions, such as Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Heads of government attending the [[1926 Imperial Conference]] included W. T. Cosgrave, then serving as [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]] (prime minister) from 1922 to 1932. It was recorded that the distinct characteristics and histories of each was recognised by the parties attending the Conference,&lt;/ref&gt; and such differences were manifested in this period in the design and use of flags and other national symbols for the Irish Free State and other dominions.&lt;ref&gt;See "The Flags of Canada", Alistair B. Fraser, 1998, [http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Nation/NatSym.html] 1_For the chronology of Canadian flags from 1870, at the time of the Irish republican movement, see Appendix III [http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Appendicies/Chronology.html]. 2_For explanation of the distinction between national flags and monarchical badges or blazons of arms see Chapter I: ___"...a nation needs emblems and symbols to preserve traditions and inspire love of country. Of these symbols, the coat of arms and the flag are the chief." Charles Frederick Hamilton, Assistant Comptroller, R.C.M.P (1921) ___"The function of a flag is to send the simple message of identity. The function of arms is to dignify an individual, or institution, or country by special identifying symbolism and by appropriate reference to ancestry." John Ross Matheson, Canada's Flag: A Search for a Country (Boston G.K. Hall, 1980), p. 7. ___"Canada's flag serves to identify something Canadian. More specialized in its use, Canada's arms identify national authority and jurisdiction. Leaving aside strictly decorative uses of either, the flag is used wherever one wishes to make the simple statement: Canada or Canadian; the arms only where the authority of the nation is asserted." Alistair B. Fraser, 1998, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed revival==
During the [[Easter Rising]] in [[Dublin]] in 1916, some [[Irish republicanism|republican]] leaders, including [[Patrick Pearse]] and [[Joseph Plunkett]], contemplated giving the throne of an independent [[Ireland]] to [[Prince Joachim of Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ELcuAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22prince+joachim%22+ireland+1916&amp;dq=%22prince+joachim%22+ireland+1916&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir9tyF8vDLAhXIORQKHdNtDzQQ6AEIOjAD ''Memoirs of Desmond FitzGerald, 1913-1916''],  [[Desmond FitzGerald (politician)|Desmond FitzGerald]]; Routledge &amp; K.

According to [[Hugo O'Donnell, 7th Duke of Tetuan]], [[Éamon de Valera]] raised the idea of an Irish monarchy with his great-grandfather Juan O'Donnell.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zWgfwHuOCHYC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=tim+pat+coogan+o%27donnell+monarchy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zB7Y_k66Z7&amp;sig=-nDzzdXJ-jqtC3MVHd2k1nNJgyw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiEsKbKvJjeAhWMOsAKHVEVCKgQ6AEwBnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20pat%20coogan%20o'donnell%20monarchy&amp;f=false ''Ireland In The 20th Century''], Tim Pat Coogan, page 175&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mongolian armour''' has a long history. Mongol [[armour]] drew its influence from [[Chinese armour|Chinese]] and [[Middle Eastern]] styles. Most Mongolian armour was of [[Scale armour|scale]] and [[Lamellar armour|lamellar]] variety. Most armour was made of hardened [[leather]] and [[iron]], lanced together onto a fabric backing, sometimes silk. Mail armour was also sometimes used, but was rare, probably due to its weight and difficulty to repair. Mongol archers demanded the armour be light enough so that when riding, it didn't interfere with their mobility{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. It is also possible that the Mongol armour lacked mail and was generally lighter than its counterparts to the East and West because the nomadic habits of the Mongols were not conducive to the labour-intensive practices and permanent facilities necessary for making mail or large plates.  Sometimes arm protection was removed so that a rider could draw their bow. The helmet was made of mostly iron, but leather and other materials were also used. Lamellar armour was also used by the countries that were affected by the invasion of the Mongols worldwide, including the conquest of China and the Middle East. This is especially shown by [[Tamerlane]], a debatably Mongol warlord of the 15th century that used lamellar armour consistently with his cavalry, and garbed himself and his men in Mongolian armour during war.

[[Genghis Khan]] was once said to have issued all his horsemen with silk vests, as an arrow hitting silk does not break it but ends up embedded in the flesh wrapped in silk, allowing the arrow to be removed by gently teasing the silk open, as opposed to the usual method of removing barbed arrows, cutting them out or pushing them right through an injured limb and out of the other side. These silk vests functioned much like the padded armour used by European and Byzantine soldiers of the era, such as the [[gambeson]].&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen. (2003). Mongol Warrior 1200 - 1500.

'''Myene''' is a cluster of closely related [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] varieties spoken in [[Gabon]] by about 46,000 people. It is perhaps the most divergent of the Narrow Bantu languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/ehret/kinship/BantuClassification%204-09.pdf Bantu Classification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624221430/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/ehret/kinship/BantuClassification%204-09.pdf |date=2012-06-24 }}, Ehret, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; though Nurse &amp; Philippson (2003) place it in with the [[Tsogo languages]] (B.30). The more distinctive varieties are [[Mpongwe]] (''Pongoué''), Galwa (''Galloa''), and Nkomi.

'''Nepalese in South Korea''' comprise [[Koreans|Korean Citizens]] and [[Nepalis|Nepalese]] migrant workers, including temporary expatriates and permanent residents, as well as their locally born descendants of either [[Koreans|Korean]] or [[Nepalis|Nepalese]] nationality. The [[Nepalis|Nepalese]] in South Korea are mainly of four distinct ethnic groups : [[Bahun|Bahun (Brahmins)]], [[Chhetri|Chhetri (Rajputs)]], [[Madhesi people|Madhesis]] and [[indigenous people|Janjati]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkonetwork.com/news/nepal/nepali-workers-south-korea-provide-aid-rss/|title=Korea Madhesi Society to inspect condition of migrant Madhesi Victims in korea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
The first wave of Nepalese immigration began in the late 1980s. After Nepal restored its democracy in the 1990s, labour laws were changed to allow  Nepalese youths to go abroad in search of work.&lt;ref name="KoreaTimes20091023"/&gt; The Nepalese community in South Korea thus consists primarily of migrant workers, but also has large numbers of students as well as Nepalese women married to South Korean men they met through international matchmaking agencies.&lt;ref name="KoreaTimes20091023"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Daily News and Analysis|title=Nepali girls sold as 'brides' to old South Koreans|date=2009-02-15|accessdate=2010-08-23|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_nepali-girls-sold-as-brides-to-old-south-koreans_1230977}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nepali government are attempting to induce Nepali workers staying illegally in South Korea (roughly 2,500 {{asof|2010|lc=on}}) to return home, in hopes that the South Korean government will increase its intake of Nepali workers in future years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/07/120_59591.html|date=2010-01-24|accessdate=2010-08-26|title=Nepal to Roll Back 2,500 Illegal Workers From Korea|periodical=The Korea Times|last=Giri|first=Anil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
The Nepalese community managed to keep their traditions alive while living in South Korea. Nepalese festivals such as [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]], [[Dasain]] and [[Teej]] are celebrated throughout the country.&lt;ref name="KoreaTimes20091023"/&gt;

==Organisations==
The Non-Resident Nepali Association of Korea is one organisation for Nepalese people living in South Korea. In 2010, they opened a shelter in [[Dongdaemun-gu]], [[Seoul]] to provide charitable assistance for Nepalese who become unemployed or otherwise face difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nepal house inaugurated in SKorea|date=2010-08-18|accessdate=2010-08-23|periodical=República|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=22322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another organisation, aimed specifically at [[international student]]s, is the [[Society_of_Nepalese_Students_in_Korea-SONSIK|Society of Nepalese Students in Korea (SONSIK)]], established in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.imaeil.com/sub_news/sub_news_view.php?news_id=34157&amp;yy=2010|periodical=Maeil Shinmun|date=2010-08-23|accessdate=2010-08-23|title=전국 네팔 유학생회 대구서 모임, 한국과 학술교류 통해 유대 강화|last=Hwang|first=Su-yeong}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea's multilingual Migrant Workers' Television was founded by Nepali migrant worker [[Minod Moktan]] (Minu), a human rights activist who stayed in South Korea as an illegal alien for nearly 18 years before his deportation in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/12/117_54223.html|date=2009-10-25|accessdate=2010-08-26|title=Nepalese Activist Deported|last=Bae|first=Ji-sook|periodical=The Korea Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last decade, however, with growing public awareness about climate change and the critical role that carbon dioxide and methane emissions plays in causing the heating of the earth's atmosphere, there's been a resurgence in the intensity nuclear power debate once again.  Nuclear power advocates and those who are most concerned about climate change point to nuclear power's reliable, emission-free, high-density energy and a generation of young physicists and engineers working to bring a new generation of nuclear technology into existence to replace fossil fuels. On the other hand, skeptics can point to two frightening nuclear accidents, the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986 and subsequently the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], combined with escalating acts of global terrorism, to argue against continuing use of the technology.

The debate continues today between those who fear the power of nuclear and those who fear what will happen to the earth if humanity doesn't use nuclear power. At the 1963 ground-breaking for what would become the world's largest nuclear power plant, President [[John F. Kennedy]] declared that nuclear power was a "step on the long road to peace," and that by using "science and technology to achieve significant breakthroughs" that we could "conserve the resources" to leave the world in better shape. Yet he also acknowledged that the Atomic Age was a "dreadful age" and "when we broke the atom apart, we changed the history of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/local/hanford/article32142282.html|title=1963: At Hanford, Kennedy promises to lead the world in nuclear power (with video)|work=tri-cityherald|access-date=17 July 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107005820/http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/local/hanford/article32142282.html|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pro-nuclear movement|Proponents of nuclear energy]] argue that nuclear power is a clean and [[sustainable energy]] source which provides huge amounts of uninterrupted energy without [[Air pollution|polluting the atmosphere]] or emitting the [[carbon emissions]] that cause [[global warming]]. Use of nuclear power provides plentiful, well-paying jobs, [[energy security]], reduces a dependence on imported fuels and exposure to price risks associated with resource speculation and Middle East politics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=aXb5iuqdZoD4&amp;refer=us U.S. Energy Legislation May Be `Renaissance' for Nuclear Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626182130/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103 |date=26 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents advance the notion that nuclear power produces virtually no air pollution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/?page=nuclear_environment|title=Nuclear Power and the Environment – Energy Explained, Your Guide To Understanding Energy – Energy Information Administration|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=17 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817005344/https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/?page=nuclear_environment|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the massive amount of pollution and carbon emission generated from burning [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] like coal, oil and natural gas. Modern society demands always-on energy to power communications, computer networks, transportation, industry and residences at all times of day and night. In the absence of nuclear power, utilities need to burn fossil fuels to keep the energy grid reliable, even with access to solar and wind energy, because those sources are intermittent.  Proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable course for a country to achieve energy independence while also meeting their "ambitious" nationally determined contributions (NDC's) to reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the [[Paris Agreement]] signed by 195 nations. They emphasize that the risks of storing waste are small and existing stockpiles can be reduced by [[Nuclear recycling|using this waste]] to produce fuels for the latest technology in newer reactors. Finally, even though [[Alarmism|alarmist]] media reports of nuclear accidents raised fear levels a lot, in fact the Chernobyl disaster caused 56 direct deaths and Fukushima reactors caused no actual deaths as a result of the nuclear meltdown.

[[Anti-nuclear movement|Opponents]] say that nuclear power poses numerous threats to people and the environment and point to studies in the literature that question if it will ever be a [[sustainable]] energy source. These threats include health risks, accidents and environmental damage from [[uranium mining]], processing and transport.  Along with the fears associated with [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons proliferation]], nuclear power opponents fear [[Nuclear terrorism|sabotage by terrorists]] of nuclear plants, diversion and misuse of radioactive fuels or fuel waste, as well as naturally-occurring leakage from the unsolved and imperfect long-term storage process of radioactive [[nuclear waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theworldreporter.com/2010/09/nuclear-energy-is-not-green.html |title=Nuclear Energy is not a New Clear Resource |publisher=Theworldreporter.com |date=2 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304060553/http://www.theworldreporter.com/2010/09/nuclear-energy-is-not-green.html |archivedate=4 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gierec"&gt;Greenpeace International and European Renewable Energy Council (January 2007).

{{pro and con list|section|date=February 2015}}

Two opposing camps have evolved in society with respect to nuclear power, one supporting and promoting nuclear power and another [[anti-nuclear movement|opposing it]]. At the heart of this divide sit different views of risk and individual beliefs regarding public involvement in making decisions about large-scale high technology. Questions which emerge include: is nuclear power safe for humans and the environment? Could another [[Chernobyl disaster]] or [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]] happen? Can we dispose of [[nuclear waste]] in a safe manner? Can nuclear power help to reduce [[climate change]] and [[air pollution]] in a timely way?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/103237/2/StaffPaper11-01.pdf |title=Social and Ethical Considerations of Nuclear Power Development |author1=John R.

In the 2010 book ''Why vs. Why: Nuclear Power''&lt;ref name=bl&gt;Brook, B.W. &amp; Lowe, I. (2010). ''Why vs Why: Nuclear Power.'' Pantera Press, {{ISBN|978-0-9807418-5-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Brook (scientist)|Barry Brook]] and [[Ian Lowe]] discuss and articulate the debate about nuclear power. Brook makes the following seven arguments in favor of nuclear energy:&lt;ref name=bl/&gt;
*[[Renewable energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] may not solve the energy and [[Climate crisis|climate crises]]
*Nuclear fuel is virtually unlimited and has extremely high [[specific energy]]
*New technology may be able to safely dispose of [[nuclear waste]]
*Nuclear power is claimed to be the safest energy option
*Advanced nuclear power may strengthen global security
*Nuclear power's [[Environmental full-cost accounting|true costs]] are claimed to be lower than either fossil fuels or renewables
*Nuclear power may lead the "[[clean energy]]" revolution

Lowe, in turn, makes the following arguments against nuclear power:&lt;ref name=bl/&gt;
*It may not be a fast enough response to [[climate change]]
*It is claimed to be too expensive
*The need for [[baseload electricity]] may be exaggerated
*The problem of waste may still remain unresolved
*It may increase the risk of [[nuclear war]]
*There are claimed to be major safety concerns
*There are claimed to be better alternatives

''[[The Economist]]'' says that nuclear power "looks dangerous, unpopular, expensive and risky", and that "it is replaceable with relative ease and could be forgone with no huge structural shifts in the way the world works". When asking what the world would be like without it ''[[The Economist]]'' notes that "without nuclear power and with other fuels filling in its share pro rata, emissions from generation would have been about 11 billion tonnes. The difference is roughly equal to the total annual emissions of Germany and Japan combined."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18441163 |title=Nuclear power: When the steam clears |date=24 March 2011 |work=The Economist |page= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429091156/http://www.economist.com/node/18441163 |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in [[Scientific American]] said nuclear plants should be built if both the cost and the risk are low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/antinuclear-austria-should-lead-the-way-on-nuclear-power/|title=Antinuclear Austria Should Lead the Way on Nuclear Power|first=Seth|last=Baum|date=|website=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930072543/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/antinuclear-austria-should-lead-the-way-on-nuclear-power/|archivedate=30 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity and energy supplied==
The [[World Nuclear Association]] has reported that nuclear electricity generation in 2012 was at its lowest level since 1999.  The WNA has said that “nuclear power generation suffered its biggest ever one-year fall through 2012 as the bulk of the Japanese fleet remained offline for a full calendar year”.&lt;ref name=wna13/&gt;

Data from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] showed that nuclear power plants globally produced {{Convert|2346|TWh|}} of electricity in 2012 – 7% less than in 2011. The figures illustrate the effects of a full year of 48 Japanese power reactors producing no power during the year. The permanent closure of eight reactor units in Germany was also a factor. Problems at [[Crystal River 3 Nuclear Generating Station|Crystal River]], [[Fort Calhoun]] and the two [[San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station|San Onofre]] units in the USA meant they produced no power for the full year, while in Belgium Doel 3 and Tihange 2 were out of action for six months. Compared to 2010, the nuclear industry produced 11% less electricity in 2012.&lt;ref name=wna13&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Nuclear_power_down_in_2012_2006131.html |title=Nuclear power down in 2012 |author=WNA |date=20 June 2013 |work=World Nuclear News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213032758/http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Nuclear_power_down_in_2012_2006131.html |archivedate=13 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil, China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K. now  all  generate  more  electricity from non-hydro renewable energy than from nuclear sources. In 2015, new power generation using [[solar power]] was 33% of the global total, [[wind power]] over 17%, and 1.3% for nuclear power, exclusively due to development in China.&lt;ref name="ISR2016"&gt;[[Mycle Schneider]], [http://www.worldnuclearreport.org/IMG/pdf/20160713MSC-WNISR2016-S%26C-LR-EN.pdf The World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2016: Summary and Conclusions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817141034/http://www.worldnuclearreport.org/IMG/pdf/20160713MSC-WNISR2016-S%26C-LR-EN.pdf|date=17 August 2016}}, 13 July 2016, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have documented how nuclear power plants generate 16% of global electricity, but provide only 6.3% of energy production and 2.6% of final energy consumption. This mismatch stems mainly from the poor consumption efficiency of electricity compared to other energy carriers, and the transmission losses associated with nuclear plants which are usually situated far away from sources of demand.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', World Scientific, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 7,000&amp;nbsp;hours is roughly representative of how long any given reactor will remain critical in a year, meaning that the scram rates translates into a sudden and unplanned shutdown about 0.6&amp;nbsp;times per year for any given reactor in the world.  The unplanned capacity loss factor represents amount of power not produced due to unplanned scrams and postponed restarts.

The [[World Nuclear Association]] argues that: "Obviously sun, wind, tides and waves cannot be controlled to provide directly either continuous [[base load power plant|base-load]] power, or peak-load power when it is needed,..." "In practical terms non-hydro renewables are therefore able to supply up to some 15–20% of the capacity of an electricity grid, though they cannot directly be applied as economic substitutes for most coal or nuclear power, however significant they become in particular areas with favourable conditions." "If the fundamental opportunity of these renewables is their abundance and relatively widespread occurrence, the fundamental challenge, especially for electricity supply, is applying them to meet demand given their variable and diffuse nature. This means either that there must be reliable duplicate sources of electricity beyond the normal system reserve, or some means of electricity storage." "Relatively few places have scope for [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage]] dams close to where the power is needed, and overall efficiency is less than 80%. Means of storing large amounts of electricity as such in giant batteries or by other means have not been developed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf10.html| title= Renewable Energy and Electricity| date= June 2010| publisher= World Nuclear Association| accessdate= 4 July 2010| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100619061729/http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf10.html| archivedate= 19 June 2010| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], most studies critiquing solar and wind energy look only at individual generators and not at the system wide effects of solar and wind farms. Correlations between power swings drop substantially as more solar and [[wind farm]]s are integrated (a process known as geographical smoothing) and a wider geographic area also enables a larger pool of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] efforts to abate intermittency.&lt;ref name=bks220&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sovacool says that [[variable renewable energy]] sources such as [[wind power]] and [[solar energy]] can displace nuclear resources.&lt;ref name=bks220/&gt; "Nine recent studies have concluded that the variability and intermittency of wind and solar resources becomes easier to manage the more they are deployed and interconnected, not the other way around, as some utilities suggest. This is because wind and solar plants help grid operators handle major outages and contingencies elsewhere in the system, since they generate power in smaller increments that are less damaging than unexpected outages from large plants".&lt;ref name=bks220/&gt;

According to a 2011 projection by the [[International Energy Agency]], [[solar power]] generators may produce most of the world’s electricity within 50 years, with [[wind power]], [[hydroelectricity]] and [[biomass]] plants supplying much of the remaining generation. "[[Photovoltaic]] and [[concentrated solar power]] together can become the major source of electricity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-29/solar-may-produce-most-of-world-s-power-by-2060-iea-says.html |title=Solar May Produce Most of World's Power by 2060, IEA Says |author=Ben Sills |date=29 August 2011 |work=Bloomberg |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225235521/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-29/solar-may-produce-most-of-world-s-power-by-2060-iea-says.html |archivedate=25 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable technologies can enhance energy security in [[electricity generation]], heat supply, and [[transportation]].&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2007/so_contribution.pdf|title=IEA - 404 Not Found|author=|date=|website=www.iea.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318231652/http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2007/so_contribution.pdf|archivedate=18 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the [[World Nuclear Association]] has said "There is unprecedented interest in renewable energy, particularly solar and wind energy, which provide electricity without giving rise to any carbon dioxide emission. Harnessing these for electricity depends on the cost and efficiency of the technology, which is constantly improving, thus reducing costs per peak kilowatt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Energy-and-Environment/Renewable-Energy-and-Electricity/#.Uk55wWV-9LM |title=Renewable Energy and Electricity |author=World Nuclear Association |date=September 2013 |work= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004190049/http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Energy-and-Environment/Renewable-Energy-and-Electricity/#.Uk55wWV-9LM |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source. [[Nuclear power plant]]s typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low direct fuel costs (with much of the costs of fuel extraction, processing, use and long term storage externalized).  Therefore, comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants. Cost estimates also need to take into account [[nuclear decommissioning|plant decommissioning]] and [[nuclear waste]] storage costs. On the other hand, measures to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate]] [[global warming]], such as a [[carbon tax]] or [[carbon emissions trading]], may favor the economics of nuclear power.

In recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult, which impairs large projects such as nuclear reactors, with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks.&lt;ref name="kidd2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&amp;storyCode=2058653|title=New reactors—more or less?|author=Kidd, Steve|date=21 January 2011|work=Nuclear Engineering International|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212195417/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&amp;storyCode=2058653|archivedate=12 December 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance, notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavoda in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out.&lt;ref name="kidd2011" /&gt; The reliable availability of cheap gas poses a major economic disincentive for nuclear projects.&lt;ref name=kidd2011/&gt;

Many countries have now liberalized the [[electricity market]] where these risks, and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=MIT-2003&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/ |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |year=2003 |isbn=0-615-12420-8 |accessdate=10 November 2006 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518215841/http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/ |archivedate=18 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost of decommissioning nuclear plants ===
{{main|Nuclear decommissioning}}
The price of energy inputs and the environmental costs of every nuclear power plant continue long after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Both nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities must be decommissioned,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018|reason=Only if the plant is shut down?}} returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses. After a cooling-off period that may last as long as a century,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} reactors must be dismantled and cut into small pieces to be packed in containers for final disposal. The process is very expensive, time-consuming, dangerous for workers, hazardous to the natural environment, and presents new opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.&lt;ref name=sov11/&gt;{{Third-party-inline|date=January 2015}}

The total energy required for decommissioning can be as much as 50% more than the energy needed for the original construction. In most cases, the decommissioning process costs between US $300 million to US $5.6 billion.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Decommissioning at nuclear sites which have experienced a serious accident are the most expensive and time-consuming. In the U.S. there are 13 reactors that have permanently shut down and are in some phase of decommissioning, and none of them have completed the process.&lt;ref name=sov11&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', World Scientific, p. 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of nuclear power claim that it is the beneficiary of inappropriately large [[Subsidy|economic subsidies]], taking the form of research and development, financing support for building new reactors and decommissioning old reactors and waste, and that these subsidies are often overlooked when comparing the economics of nuclear against other forms of power generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Power: Still Not Viable without Subsidies|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_power/nuclear_power_and_global_warming/nuclear-power-subsidies-report.html|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=4 February 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204004404/http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_power/nuclear_power_and_global_warming/nuclear-power-subsidies-report.html|archivedate=4 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billions of Dollars in Subsidies for the Nuclear Power Industry Will Shift Financial Risks to Taxpayers|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/Nuclear-Subsidies-in-APA-and-ACELA.pdf|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=4 February 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110185209/http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/Nuclear-Subsidies-in-APA-and-ACELA.pdf|archivedate=10 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nuclear power proponents argue that competing energy sources also receive subsidies. Fossil fuels receive large direct and indirect subsidies, such as tax benefits and not having to pay for the [[greenhouse gas]]es they emit, such as through a [[carbon tax]]. Renewable energy sources receive proportionately large direct production subsidies and tax breaks in many nations, although in absolute terms they are often less than subsidies received by non-renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="wna-esaec"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf68.html |title=Energy Subsidies and External Costs |accessdate=10 November 2006 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |year=2005 |work=Information and Issue Briefs |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204135806/http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf68.html |archivedate=4 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the [[Seventh Framework Programme|FP7]] research program has more subsidies for nuclear power than for renewable and energy efficiency together; over 70% of this is directed at the [[ITER]] [[Fusion power|fusion]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/budget_en.html|title=FP7 budget breakdown|author=|date=|website=europa.eu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925163620/http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/budget_en.html |archivedate=25 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/euratom/home_en.html|title=FP7 Euratom spending|author=|date=|website=europa.eu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907135645/http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/euratom/home_en.html |archivedate=7 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, public research money for nuclear fission declined from 2,179 to 35 million dollars between 1980 and 2000.&lt;ref name="wna-esaec" /&gt;

A 2010 report by Global Subsidies Initiative compared relative subsidies of most common energy sources.

The potential costs resulting from a [[nuclear accident]] (including one caused by a terrorist attack or a natural disaster) are great. The liability of owners of nuclear power plants in the U.S. is currently limited under the [[Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act|Price-Anderson Act]] (PAA). The Price-Anderson Act, introduced in 1957, was "an implicit admission that nuclear power provided risks that producers were unwilling to assume without federal backing".&lt;ref name=bks&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sovacool | first1 = Benjamin K. | authorlink = Benjamin K.

Without such protection, private companies were unwilling to be involved. No other technology in the history of American industry has enjoyed such continuing blanket protection.&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Third-party-inline|date=January 2015}}

The PAA was due to expire in 2002, and the former U.S. vice-president [[Dick Cheney]] said in 2001 that "nobody's going to invest in nuclear power plants" if the PAA is not renewed.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, 2001.

In 1983, [[U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (USNRC) concluded that the liability limits placed on nuclear insurance were significant enough to constitute a subsidy, but did not attempt to quantify the value of such a subsidy at that time.&lt;ref&gt;United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 1983. The Price-Anderson Act: the Third Decade, NUREG-0957&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this in 1990, Dubin and Rothwell were the first to estimate the value to the U.S. nuclear industry of the limitation on liability for nuclear power plants under the Price Anderson Act. Their underlying method was to extrapolate the premiums operators currently pay versus the full liability they would have to pay for full insurance in the absence of the PAA limits. The size of the estimated subsidy per reactor per year was $60 million prior to the 1982 amendments, and up to $22 million following the 1988 amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1465-7287.1990.tb00645.x |title=Subsidy to Nuclear Power Through Price-Anderson Liability Limit |year=1990 |last1=Dubin |first1=Jeffrey A. |last2=Rothwell |first2=Geoffrey S. |journal=Contemporary Economic Policy |volume=8 |issue=3 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate article in 2003, Anthony Heyes updates the 1988 estimate of $22 million per year to $33 million (2001 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heyes |first=Anthony |year=2003 |title=Determining the Price of Price-Anderson |journal=Regulation |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=105–10 |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/rcatorbg25&amp;div=57&amp;id=&amp;page= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502202917/http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals%2Frcatorbg25&amp;div=57&amp;id=&amp;page= |archivedate=2 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of a nuclear accident, should claims exceed this primary liability, the PAA requires all licensees to additionally provide a maximum of $95.8 million into the accident pool – totaling roughly $10 billion if all reactors were required to pay the maximum. This is still not sufficient in the case of a serious accident, as the cost of damages could exceed $10 billion.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy. 1999.

==Environmental effects==
{{Main|Environmental effects of nuclear power}}
{{See also|Uranium mining debate|Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents}}

The primary environmental effects of nuclear power come from [[uranium mining]], radioactive effluent emissions, and [[waste heat]]. Nuclear generation does not directly produce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury or other pollutants associated with the combustion of fossil fuels.

Nuclear plants require slightly more cooling water than fossil-fuel power plants due to their slightly lower generation efficiencies.  Uranium mining can use large amounts of water — for example, the [[Roxby Downs, South Australia|Roxby Downs]] mine in South Australia uses {{Convert|35|e6L|gal}} of water each day and plans to increase this to {{Convert|150|e6L|gal}} per day.&lt;ref name="powerandwater"&gt;[http://www.sciencealert.com.au/opinions/20072910-16508.html Nuclear power and water scarcity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721060842/http://www.sciencealert.com.au/opinions/20072910-16508.html |date=21 July 2008 }}, ScienceAlert, 28 October 2007, Retrieved 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources}}

While nuclear power does not directly emit greenhouse gases, emissions occur, as with every source of energy, over a facility's life cycle: mining and fabrication of construction materials, plant construction, operation, uranium mining and milling, and plant decommissioning. A literature survey by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] of 32 greenhouse gas emissions studies, found a median value of {{Cvt|16|g|}} equivalent lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt hour (kWh) for nuclear power.&lt;ref name="IPCC Annex II"&gt;Moomaw, W., P.

Since the fraction of a [[radioisotope]]'s atoms decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to its half-life, the relative radioactivity of a quantity of buried human [[radioactive waste]] would diminish over time compared to natural radioisotopes (such as the [[decay chain]] of 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium which are [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each]] over the crust's 3{{e|19}} ton mass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00207230601047255 |title=Considerations for nuclear power in Australia |year=2006 |last1=Sevior |first1=Martin |journal=International Journal of Environmental Studies |volume=63 |issue=6 |page=859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mragheb.com/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Thorium%20Resources%20in%20%20Rare%20Earth%20Elements.pdf |title=Thorium Resources In Rare Earth Elements |first=M. |last=Ragheb |date=7 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203024132/http://mragheb.com/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Thorium%20Resources%20in%20%20Rare%20Earth%20Elements.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2007AGUFM.V33A1161P |title=Mass and Composition of the Continental Crust Estimated Using the CRUST2.0 Model |author1=Peterson |first1=B.

For instance, over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top {{Convert|2000|feet|}} of rock and soil in the United States ({{Convert|100|e6km2||abbr=unit|disp=or}}) by [[Approximation#Mathematics|approximately]] 0.1 [[parts per million]] over the cumulative amount of [[Natural radioactivity|natural radioisotopes]] in such a volume, although the vicinity of the site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=193–203 |year=1998 |last1=Cohen |title=Perspectives on the High Level Waste Disposal Problem |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=0308-0188&amp;volume=23&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=193&amp;epage=203 |first=Bernard L. |doi=10.1179/030801898789764480 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, waste is mainly stored at individual reactor sites and there are over 430 locations around the world where radioactive material continues to accumulate.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Experts agree that centralized underground repositories which are well-managed, guarded, and monitored, would be a vast improvement.&lt;ref name=mont2011&gt;Montgomery, Scott L.

===Prevented mortality===
In March 2013, climate scientists Pushker Kharecha and [[James Hansen]] published a paper in [[Environmental Science &amp; Technology]], entitled ''Prevented mortality and greenhouse gas emissions from historical and projected nuclear power''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es3051197 |title=Prevented Mortality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Historical and Projected Nuclear Power |year=2013 |last1=Kharecha |first1=Pushker A. |last2=Hansen |first2=James E. |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=47 |issue=9 |page=4889 |bibcode=2013EnST...47.4889K}}&lt;/ref&gt; It estimated an average of 1.8 million lives saved worldwide by the use of nuclear power instead of fossil fuels between 1971 and 2009. The paper examined mortality levels per unit of electrical energy produced from fossil fuels (coal and natural gas) as well as nuclear power. Kharecha and Hansen assert that their results are probably conservative, as they analyze only deaths and do not include a range of serious but non-fatal respiratory illnesses, cancers, hereditary effects and heart problems, nor do they include the fact that fossil fuel combustion in developing countries tends to have a higher carbon and air pollution footprint than in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/91/web/2013/04/Nuclear-Power-Prevents-Deaths-Causes.html |title=Nuclear Power Prevents More Deaths Than It Causes &amp;#124; Chemical &amp; Engineering News |publisher=Cen.acs.org |accessdate=18 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301145251/http://cen.acs.org/articles/91/web/2013/04/Nuclear-Power-Prevents-Deaths-Causes.html |archivedate=1 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors also conclude that the emission of some {{Convert|64|e9tonne||lk=on}} of carbon dioxide equivalent have been avoided by nuclear power between 1971 and 2009, and that between 2010 and 2050, nuclear power could additionally avoid up to {{Convert|80-240|e9tonne|}}.

The effect of nuclear accidents has been a topic of debate practically since the first [[nuclear reactor]]s were constructed. It has also been a key factor in [[Anti-nuclear movement|public concern about nuclear facilities]].&lt;ref name=mvr&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.environ.033108.092057 |title=Nuclear Power: Economic, Safety, Health, and Environmental Issues of Near-Term Technologies |year=2009 |last1=Ramana |first1=M.V. |journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources |volume=34 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some technical measures to reduce the risk of accidents or to minimize the amount of [[radioactivity]] released to the environment have been adopted. Despite the use of such measures, "there have been many accidents with varying effects as well near misses and incidents".&lt;ref name="mvr"/&gt;

Nuclear power plants are a complex energy system&lt;ref name=stor&gt;Storm van Leeuwen, Jan (2008). [http://www.stormsmith.nl/ Nuclear power – the energy balance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101000745/http://www.stormsmith.nl/ |date=1 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 53 &amp; p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and opponents of nuclear power have criticized the sophistication and complexity of the technology. [[Helen Caldicott]] has said: "... in essence, a nuclear reactor is just a very sophisticated and dangerous way to boil water – analogous to cutting a pound of butter with a chain saw."&lt;ref&gt;Helen Caldicott (2006).  ''Nuclear power is not the answer to global warming or anything else'', Melbourne University Press, {{ISBN|0-522-85251-3}}, p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt; The 1979 Three Mile Island accident inspired [[Charles Perrow]]'s book ''[[Normal Accidents]]'', where a [[nuclear accident]] occurs, resulting from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system. TMI was an example of a normal accident because it was deemed "unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable".&lt;ref&gt;Perrow, C. (1982), ‘The President’s Commission and the Normal Accident’, in Sils, D., Wolf, C. and Shelanski, V. (Eds), ''Accident at Three Mile Island: The Human Dimensions'', Westview, Boulder, pp.173–184.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Perrow concluded that the failure at Three Mile Island was a consequence of the system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'. Therefore, he suggested, we might do better to contemplate a radical redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely.&lt;ref name=nature477&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/477404a |title=In retrospect: Normal Accidents |year=2011 |last1=Pidgeon |first1=Nick |journal=Nature |volume=477 |issue=7365 |page=404|bibcode=2011Natur.477..404P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of nuclear power argue that in comparison to any other form of power, nuclear power is the safest form of energy, accounting for all the risks from mining to production to storage, including the risks of spectacular nuclear accidents. Accidents in the nuclear industry have been less damaging than accidents in the [[hydroelectric power]] industry, and less damaging than the constant, incessant damage from [[Air pollution|air pollutants]] from fossil fuels. For instance, by running a 1000-[[MWe]] nuclear power plant including uranium mining, reactor operation and waste disposal, the radiation dose is 136 person-rem/year, while the dose is 490 person-rem/year for an equivalent coal-fired power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ornl.gov/sites/default/files/ORNL%20Review%20v26n3-4%201993.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131190702/https://www.ornl.gov/sites/default/files/ORNL%20Review%20v26n3-4%201993.pdf |archivedate=31 January 2017 |df= }} pg28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hvistendahl |first=Mara |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste |title=Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste |publisher=Scientific American |accessdate=18 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612103809/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Nuclear Association]] provides a comparison of deaths from accidents in course of different forms of energy production.

[[File:Chernobyl radiation map 1996.svg|thumb|right|Map showing caesium-137 contamination in [[Belarus]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]] as of 1996.]]
The Chernobyl steam explosion was a [[nuclear accident]] that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Ukraine]]. A steam explosion and graphite fire released large quantities of [[radioactive contamination]] into the atmosphere, which spread over much of Western USSR and Europe. It is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (the other being the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]).&lt;ref name="BBCWorse"&gt;{{cite news |last=Black |first=Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13048916 |title='&amp;#39;Fukushima: As Bad as Chernobyl?'&amp;#39; |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=12 April 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816212750/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13048916 |archivedate=16 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18&amp;nbsp;billion [[ruble]]s, crippling the Soviet economy.&lt;ref&gt;From interviews with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Hans Blix]] and [[Vassili Nesterenko]]. {{cite video |title=The Battle of Chernobyl |publisher=Discovery Channel}} Relevant video locations: 31:00, 1:10:00.&lt;/ref&gt;  The accident raised concerns about the [[nuclear safety|safety]] of the nuclear power industry, slowing its expansion for a number of years.&lt;ref name=Kagarlitsky&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Detente: Rethinking East-West Relations |chapter=Perestroika: The Dialectic of Change|last=Kagarlitsky|first=Boris|editor=[[Mary Kaldor]] |editor2=Gerald Holden |editor3=[[Richard A.

Despite the fact the Chernobyl disaster became a nuclear power safety debate icon, there were other nuclear accidents in USSR at the [[Mayak|Mayak nuclear weapons production plant]] (nearby [[Chelyabinsk]], Russia) and total radioactive emissions in Chelyabinsk accidents of 1949, 1957 and 1967 together were significantly higher than in Chernobyl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Russia Environmental Issues |url=http://www.countriesquest.com/europe/russia/land_and_resources/environmental_issues.htm |website=Countries Quest |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the region near Chelyabinsk was and is much more sparsely populated than the region around Chernobyl. 

The [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) has conducted 20 years of detailed scientific and [[epidemiological]] research on the effects of the Chernobyl accident. Apart from the 57 direct deaths in the accident itself, UNSCEAR predicted in 2005  that up to 4,000 additional [[cancer]] deaths related to the accident would appear "among the 600 000 persons receiving more significant exposures (liquidators working in 1986–87, evacuees, and residents of the most contaminated areas)".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|title=IAEA Report|work=In Focus: Chernobyl|accessdate=29 March 2006|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Focus/Chernobyl/index.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217112720/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Focus/Chernobyl/index.shtml|archivedate=17 December 2007|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus have been burdened with the continuing and substantial [[decontamination]] and health care costs of the Chernobyl disaster.&lt;ref name="Hallenbeck 1994 15"&gt;{{cite book | title = Radiation Protection | last = Hallenbeck | first = William H | isbn = 0-87371-996-4 | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1994 | quote = Reported thus far are 237 cases of acute radiation sickness and 31 deaths. | page = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Third-party-inline|date=January 2015}}

===New reactor designs===

The nuclear power industry has moved to improve engineering design. [[Generation IV reactor|Generation IV]] reactors are now in late stage design and development to improve safety, sustainability, efficiency, and cost. Key to the latest designs is the concept of [[passive nuclear safety]].  [[Passive nuclear safety]] does not require operator actions or electronic feedback in order to shut down safely in the event of a particular type of emergency (usually overheating resulting from a loss of coolant or loss of coolant flow). This is in contrast to older-yet-common reactor designs, where the natural tendency for the reaction was to accelerate rapidly from increased temperatures.  In such a case, cooling systems must be operative to prevent meltdown.  Past design mistakes like [[Timeline of the Fukushima nuclear accidents|Fukushima]] in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |title=The lessons of Fukushima  |author=Hugh Gusterson  |date=16 March 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606023005/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |archivedate=6 June 2013  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; New reactors with passive nuclear safety eliminate this failure mode.

The [[United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] has formally engaged in pre-application activities with four applicants who have Generation IV reactors.  Of those four applicants' designs, two are [[molten salt reactors]], one is a [[compact fast reactor]], and one is a Modular [[High temperature gas-cooled reactor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Reactors (non-LWR designs)|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced.html|publisher=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|accessdate=13 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102012354/https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced.html|archivedate=2 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Levernier is an American [[Nuclear whistleblowers|nuclear whistleblower]]. Levernier worked for 23 years as a nuclear security professional, and identified security problems at U.S. nuclear facilities as part of his job. Specifically, after 9/11, he identified problems with contingency planning to protect US nuclear plants from [[nuclear terrorism|terrorist attacks]]. He said that the assumption that attackers would both enter and exit from facilities was not valid, since suicide terrorists would not need to exit. In response to this complaint, the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] withdrew Levernier's security clearance and he was assigned to clerical work. Levernier approached the [[United States Office of Special Counsel]] (OSC), which handles US federal [[whistleblower]] matters. It took the OSC four years to vindicate Levernier, ruling that the Department's retaliation was illegal – but the OSC could not reinstate Levernier's security clearance, so he was unable to regain work in nuclear security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/congress/2006_hr/whistle.pdf National Security Whistleblowers in the Post-September 11th Era] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307015913/http://fas.org/irp/congress/2006_hr/whistle.pdf |date=7 March 2016 }} pp.177–178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/07prometheus.html Nuclear power and antiterrorism: obscuring the policy contradictions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314205805/http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/07prometheus.html |date=14 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Environmental impact of nuclear power#Risk of cancer}}
A major concern in the nuclear debate is what the long-term effects of living near or working in a nuclear power station are. These concerns typically center around the potential for increased risks of cancer. However, studies conducted by non-profit, neutral agencies have found no compelling evidence of correlation between nuclear power and risk of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There has been considerable research done on the effect of low-level radiation on humans.  Debate on the applicability of [[Linear no-threshold model]] versus [[Radiation hormesis]] and other competing models continues, however, the predicted low rate of cancer with low dose means that large sample sizes are required in order to make meaningful conclusions.  A study conducted by the [[National Academy of Science]] found that carcinogenic effects of radiation does increase with dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2005/113-11/editorial.html |title=Nuclear Power and Public Health |accessdate=28 January 2009 |last=Clapp |first=Richard |date=November 2005 |work=Environmental Health Perspectives |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119113105/http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2005/113-11/editorial.html |archivedate=19 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest study on nuclear industry workers in history involved nearly a half-million individuals and concluded that a 1–2% of cancer deaths were likely due to occupational dose.  This was on the high range of what theory predicted by LNT, but was "statistically compatible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.38499.599861.E0 |title=Risk of cancer after low doses of ionising radiation: Retrospective cohort study in 15 countries |year=2005 |last1=Cardis |first1=E |journal=BMJ |volume=331 |issue=7508 |page=77 |pmid=15987704 |last2=Vrijheid |first2=M |last3=Blettner |first3=M |last4=Gilbert |first4=E |last5=Hakama |first5=M |last6=Hill |first6=C |last7=Howe |first7=G |last8=Kaldor |first8=J |last9=Muirhead |first9=CR |last10=Schubauer-Berigan |first10=M |last11=Yoshimura |first11=T |last12=Bermann |first12=F |last13=Cowper |first13=G |last14=Fix |first14=J |last15=Hacker |first15=C |last16=Heinmiller |first16=B |last17=Marshall |first17=M |last18=Thierry-Chef |first18=I |last19=Utterback |first19=D |last20=Ahn |first20=YO |last21=Amoros |first21=E |last22=Ashmore |first22=P |last23=Auvinen |first23=A |last24=Bae |first24=JM |last25=Solano |first25=JB |last26=Biau |first26=A |last27=Combalot |first27=E |last28=Deboodt |first28=P |last29=Diez Sacristan |first29=A |last30=Eklof |first30=M  |pmc=558612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) has a factsheet that outlines 6 different studies.  In 1990 the [[United States Congress]] requested the [[National Cancer Institute]] to conduct a study of cancer mortality rates around nuclear plants and other facilities covering 1950 to 1984 focusing on the change after operation started of the respective facilities.  They concluded in no link.  In 2000 the [[University of Pittsburgh]] found no link to heightened cancer deaths in people living within 5 miles of plant at the time of the [[Three Mile Island accident]].  The same year, the [[Illinois Public Health Department]] found no statistical abnormality of childhood cancers in counties with nuclear plants.  In 2001 the [[Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering]] confirmed that radiation emissions were negligibly low at the [[Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant]].  Also that year, the [[American Cancer Society]] investigated [[cancer cluster]]s around nuclear plants and concluded no link to radiation noting that cancer clusters occur regularly due to unrelated reasons.  Again in 2001, the [[Florida Bureau of Environmental Epidemiology]] reviewed claims of increased cancer rates in counties with nuclear plants, however, using the same data as the claimants, they observed no abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Scientists learned about exposure to high level radiation from studies of the effects of bombing populations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, it is difficult to trace the relationship of low level radiation exposure to resulting cancers and mutations. This is because the latency period between exposure and effect can be 25&amp;nbsp;years or more for cancer and a generation or more for genetic damage. Since nuclear generating plants have a brief history, it is early to judge the effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Current guidelines established by the NRC, require extensive emergency planning, between nuclear power plants, [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), and the local governments.  Plans call for different zones, defined by distance from the plant and prevailing weather conditions and protective actions.  In the reference cited, the plans detail different categories of emergencies and the protective actions including possible evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/emerg-plan-prep-nuc-power-bg.html |title=NRC: Backgrounder on Emergency Preparedness at Nuclear Power Plants |publisher=Nrc.gov |accessdate=18 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002131207/http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/emerg-plan-prep-nuc-power-bg.html |archivedate=2 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German study on childhood cancer in the vicinity of nuclear power plants called "the KiKK study" was published in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Kinderkrebs in der Umgebung von KernKraftwerken&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ian Fairlie, it "resulted in a public outcry and media debate in Germany which has received little attention elsewhere". It has been established "partly as a result of an earlier study by Körblein and Hoffmann&lt;ref&gt;Körblein A, Hoffmann W: .

The committee concluded that there is no significant evidence of an association between risk of childhood leukemia (in under 5 year olds) and living in proximity to a nuclear power plant.&lt;ref name="comare2011"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Further consideration of the incidence of childhood leukemia around nuclear power plants in Great Britain|publisher=[[COMARE]]|date=6 May 2011|url=http://www.comare.org.uk/press_releases/14thReportPressRelease.htm|accessdate=7 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511193856/http://www.comare.org.uk/press_releases/14thReportPressRelease.htm|archivedate=11 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety culture in host nations ===
Some [[developing countries]] which plan to go nuclear have very poor industrial safety records and problems with [[political corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2008/01/20/MN0JUDQ44.DTL|title=Safety issues cloud nuclear renaissance|author=|date=|website=sfgate.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921145236/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2008%2F01%2F20%2FMN0JUDQ44.DTL|archivedate=21 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside China, and outside the country, the speed of the nuclear construction program has raised safety concerns. Prof. [[He Zuoxiu]], who was involved with China's atomic bomb program, has said that plans to expand production of nuclear energy twentyfold by 2030 could be disastrous, as China was seriously underprepared on the safety front.

China's fast-expanding nuclear sector is opting for cheap technology that "will be 100 years old by the time dozens of its reactors reach the end of their lifespans", according to diplomatic cables from the US embassy in Beijing.&lt;ref name="guard2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/25/wikileaks-fears-china-nuclear-safety/print |title=WikiLeaks cables reveal fears over China's nuclear safety |author=Jonathan Watts |date=25 August 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930195135/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/25/wikileaks-fears-china-nuclear-safety/print |archivedate=30 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rush to build new nuclear power plants may "create problems for effective management, operation and regulatory oversight" with the biggest potential bottleneck being human resources – "coming up with enough trained personnel to build and operate all of these new plants, as well as regulate the industry".&lt;ref name="guard2011" /&gt;  The challenge for the government and nuclear companies is to "keep an eye on a growing army of contractors and subcontractors who may be tempted to cut corners".&lt;ref name="nyt-20091215"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/business/global/16chinanuke.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Nuclear Power Expansion in China Stirs Concerns|author=Keith Bradsher|date=15 December 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=21 January 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719040104/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/business/global/16chinanuke.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all|archivedate=19 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  China is advised to maintain nuclear safeguards in a business culture where quality and safety are sometimes sacrificed in favor of cost-cutting, profits, and corruption.

== Nuclear proliferation and terrorism concerns ==
{{See also|Nuclear proliferation|List of crimes involving radioactive substances}}
According to [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], the growth of nuclear power has "historically increased the ability of nations to obtain or enrich uranium for [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]], and a large-scale worldwide increase in nuclear energy facilities would exacerbate this problem, putting the world at greater risk of a nuclear war or terrorism catastrophe".&lt;ref name="enpol2010" /&gt;  The historic link between energy facilities and weapons is evidenced by the secret development or attempted development of weapons capabilities in nuclear power facilities in Pakistan, India, Iraq (prior to 1981), Iran, and to some extent in North Korea.&lt;ref name="enpol2010"/&gt;

Four [[AP1000]] reactors, which were designed by the American [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] are currently, as of 2011, being built in China&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html |title=China Nuclear Power &amp;#124; Chinese Nuclear Energy |publisher=World-nuclear.org |accessdate=18 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JfXpaADJ?url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-A-F/China--Nuclear-Power/ |archivedate=16 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a further two [[AP1000]] reactors are to be built in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/obama-administration-announces-loan-guarantees-construct-new-nuclear-power-reactors |title=Obama Administration Announces Loan Guarantees to Construct New Nuclear Power Reactors in Georgia &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=18 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501141849/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/obama-administration-announces-loan-guarantees-construct-new-nuclear-power-reactors |archivedate=1 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hyperion Power Generation]], which is designing modular reactor assemblies that are proliferation resistant, is a privately owned US corporation, as is [[Terrapower]] which has the financial backing of [[Bill Gates]] and his [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=TED2010 |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/bill_gates.html |title=Bill Gates on energy: Innovating to zero! &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |accessdate=18 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604074608/http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/bill_gates.html |archivedate=4 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vulnerability of plants to attack ===
{{See also|Vulnerability of nuclear plants to attack}}
Nuclear reactors become preferred targets during military conflict and, over the past three decades, have been repeatedly attacked during military air strikes, occupations, invasions and campaigns:&lt;ref name=benj&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', World Scientific, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In September 1980, Iran bombed the Al Tuwaitha nuclear complex in Iraq.
*In June 1981, [[Operation Opera|an Israeli air strike]] completely destroyed Iraq’s Osirak nuclear research facility.
*Between 1984 and 1987, Iraq bombed Iran’s [[Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant|Bushehr nuclear plant]] six times.
*In Iraq [[Gulf War|in 1991]], the U.S. bombed three nuclear reactors and an enrichment pilot facility.
*In 1991, Iraq launched [[SCUD missiles]] at Israel’s [[Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center|Dimona nuclear power plant]].
*In September 2003, Israel [[Operation Outside the Box|bombed a Syrian reactor]] under construction.&lt;ref name=benj/&gt;

According to a 2004 report by the U.S. [[Congressional Budget Office]], "The human, environmental, and economic costs from a successful attack on a nuclear power plant that results in the release of substantial quantities of radioactive material to the environment could be great."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=6042&amp;type=0&amp;sequence=3 "Congressional Budget Office Vulnerabilities from Attacks on Power Reactors and Spent Material"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315112627/https://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=6042&amp;type=0&amp;sequence=3 |date=15 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States [[9/11 Commission]] has said that nuclear power plants were potential targets originally considered for the [[11 September 2001]] attacks. If terrorist groups could sufficiently damage safety systems to cause a [[core meltdown]] at a nuclear power plant, and/or sufficiently damage spent fuel pools, such an attack could lead to a widespread radioactive contamination.&lt;ref name="fas12"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/pubs/_docs/Nuclear_Energy_Report-lowres.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power in the United States |author1=Charles D. Ferguson |author2=Frank A. Settle |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2012 |work=Federation of American Scientists |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525170528/https://fas.org/pubs/_docs/Nuclear_Energy_Report-lowres.pdf |archivedate=25 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If nuclear power use is to expand significantly, nuclear facilities will have to be made extremely safe from attacks that could release massive quantities of radioactivity into the environment and community. New reactor designs have features of [[passive safety]], such as the flooding of the reactor core without active intervention by reactor operators. But these safety measures have generally been developed and studied with respect to accidents, not to the deliberate reactor attack by a terrorist group. However, the US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] now also requires new reactor license applications to consider security during the design stage.&lt;ref name=fas12/&gt;

=== Use of waste byproduct as a weapon ===
An additional concern with nuclear power plants is that if the by-products of nuclear fission (the nuclear waste generated by the plant) were to be left unprotected it could be stolen and used as a [[radiological weapon]], colloquially known as a "[[dirty bomb]]". There were incidents in post-Soviet Russia of nuclear plant workers attempting to sell nuclear materials for this purpose. For example, there was such an incident in Russia in 1999 where plant workers attempted to sell 5&amp;nbsp;grams of radioactive material on the open market,&lt;ref name="nti-nwfu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/db/nistraff/1999/19990670.htm |title=Neutron Weapon from Underground |accessdate=10 November 2006 |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |year=1999 |author=Vadim Nesvizhskiy |work=Research Library |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003000511/http://www.nti.org/db/nistraff/1999/19990670.htm |archivedate=3 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an incident in 1993 where Russian workers were caught attempting to sell 4.5 kilograms of [[enriched uranium]].&lt;ref name="aa-ionsi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Almanac/Smuggling_details.shtml#4 |title=Information on Nuclear Smuggling Incidents |accessdate=10 November 2006 |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |work=Nuclear Almanac |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018180622/http://www.atomicarchive.com/Almanac/Smuggling_details.shtml#4 |archivedate=18 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gu-wgus"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,526856,00.html|title=Weapons-grade Uranium Seized|accessdate=10 November 2006|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|author1=Amelia Gentleman  |author2=Ewen MacAskill  |lastauthoramp=yes | location=London | date=25 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ag-trutiosftt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=328 |title=The Russian Uranium That is on Sale for the Terrorists |accessdate=10 November 2006 |publisher=Axis |year=2005 |author=Pavel Simonov |work=Global Challenges Research |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422084751/http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=328 |archivedate=22 April 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are additional concerns that the transportation of nuclear waste along roadways or railways opens it up for potential theft. The United Nations has since called upon world leaders to improve security in order to prevent radioactive material [[Nuclear terrorism|falling into the hands of terrorists]],&lt;ref name="bbc-acodbt"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2838743.stm |title=Action Call Over Dirty Bomb Threat |accessdate=10 November 2006 |publisher=BBC News |date=11 March 2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316054838/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2838743.stm |archivedate=16 March 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and such fears have been used as justifications for centralized, permanent, and secure waste repositories and increased security along transportation routes.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of the former, see the quotes in Erin Neff, Cy Ryan, and Benjamin Grove, [http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/special/2002/feb/15/513046106.html "Bush OKs Yucca Mountain waste site"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211055429/http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/special/2002/feb/15/513046106.html |date=11 December 2007 }}, ''Las Vegas Sun'' (15 February 2002). For an example of the latter, see [https://www.senate.gov/~schumer/SchumerWebsite/pressroom/press_releases/PR01033.html ""Dirty Bomb" Plot spurs Schumer to call for US Marshals to guard Nuclear waste that would go through New York"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081130102255/http://www.senate.gov/~schumer/SchumerWebsite/pressroom/press_releases/PR01033.html |date=30 November 2008 }}, press release of Senator Charles E. Shumer (13 June 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents state that the spent fissile fuel is not radioactive enough to create any sort of effective nuclear weapon, in a traditional sense where the radioactive material is the means of explosion.  [[Nuclear reprocessing]] plants also acquire uranium from spent reactor fuel and take the remaining waste into their custody.

There is little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the BBC indicates. The global research agency [[GlobeScan]], commissioned by BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011, several months after the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]]. In countries with existing nuclear programs, people are significantly more opposed than they were in 2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend and being more supportive of nuclear power. Most believe that boosting energy efficiency and renewable energy can meet their needs.&lt;ref name=rb2011&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15864806 |title=Nuclear power 'gets little public support worldwide' |author=Richard Black |date=25 November 2011 |work=BBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821151058/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15864806 |archivedate=21 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Just 22% agreed that "nuclear power is relatively safe and an important source of electricity, and we should build more nuclear power plants". In contrast, 71% thought their country "could almost entirely replace coal and nuclear energy within 20 years by becoming highly energy-efficient and focusing on generating energy from the Sun and wind". Globally, 39% want to continue using existing reactors without building new ones, while 30% would like to shut everything down now.&lt;ref name=rb2011/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011, [[Deutsche Bank]] analysts concluded that "the global impact of the Fukushima accident is a fundamental shift in public perception with regard to how a nation prioritizes and values its populations health, safety, security, and natural environment when determining its current and future energy pathways". As a consequence, "[[renewable energy]] will be a clear long-term winner in most energy systems, a conclusion supported by many voter surveys conducted over the past few weeks. At the same time, we consider [[natural gas]] to be, at the very least, an important transition fuel, especially in those regions where it is considered secure".&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Bank Group (2011).

===Japan===
In June 2011, both UK market research firm [[Ipsos MORI]] and the Japanese [[Asahi Shimbun]] newspaper found drops in support for nuclear power technology in most countries, with support continuing in a number including the US. The Ipsos MORI poll found that nuclear had the lowest support of any established technology for generating electricity, with 38%. Coal was at 48% support while [[solar energy]], [[wind power]] and [[Hydroelectricity|hydro]] all found favor with more than 90% of those surveyed.&lt;ref name=rb2011/&gt;

===Sweden===
A 2011 poll found that skepticism over nuclear power had grown in Sweden following Japan's nuclear crisis. 36 percent of respondents wanted to [[Nuclear phase-out|phase-out nuclear power]], up from 15 percent two years previous. An equal percentage of 36 percent were in favor of keeping nuclear power at its present level, and another 21 percent favored increasing nuclear power, with 7% undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9M4CAL00.htm |title=Poll shows anti-nuclear sentiment up in Sweden |date=22 March 2011 |work=Businessweek |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026040328/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9M4CAL00.htm |archivedate=26 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
What had been growing acceptance of nuclear power in the United States was eroded sharply following the [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents]], with support for building nuclear power plants in the U.S. dropping slightly lower than it was immediately after the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979, according to a CBS News poll. Only 43 percent of those polled 10 days after the Fukushima nuclear emergency said they would approve building new power plants in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/us/23poll.html?_r=1 |title=Nuclear Power Loses Support in New Poll |author=Michael Cooper |date=22 March 2011 |work=The New York Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126094003/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/us/23poll.html?_r=1 |archivedate=26 January 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Gallup poll in the US in March 2015 found support for nuclear power at 51%, with 43% opposed.

The two energy sources that attracted the highest levels of support in the ''2007 MIT Energy Survey'' were [[solar power]] and [[wind power]]. Outright majorities would choose to "increase a lot" use of these two sources, and over three out of four Americans would like to increase these sources in the U.S. energy portfolio. Fourteen percent of respondents would like to see [[nuclear power]] "increase a lot".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Ansolabehere.

[[Stephanie Cooke]] has argued that the cost of building new reactors is extremely high, as are the risks involved. Most utilities have said that they won't build new plants without [[Government-backed loan|government loan guarantees]].  There are also bottlenecks at factories that produce reactor pressure vessels and other equipment, and there is a shortage of qualified personnel to build and operate the reactors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephanie Cooke |year=2009 |title=[[In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age]]|publisher=Black Inc.|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the recent acceleration in nuclear power plant construction is drawing a substantial expansion of the heavy engineering capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf122_heavy_manufacturing_of_power_plants.html|title=Heavy Manufacturing of Power Plants - World Nuclear Association|author=|date=|website=www.world-nuclear.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108062405/http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf122_heavy_manufacturing_of_power_plants.html|archivedate=8 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], the [[International Energy Agency]] halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035.&lt;ref name=economist-20110428&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18621367?story_id=18621367 |title=Gauging the pressure |date=28 April 2011 |publisher=The Economist |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831040950/http://www.economist.com/node/18621367?story_id=18621367 |archivedate=31 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[S&amp;P Global Platts|Platts]] has reported that "the crisis at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/ElectricPower/6925550 |title=NEWS ANALYSIS: Japan crisis puts global nuclear expansion in doubt  |date=21 March 2011 |publisher=Platts }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, ''The Economist'' reported that nuclear power "looks dangerous, unpopular, expensive and risky", and that "it is replaceable with relative ease and could be forgone with no huge structural shifts in the way the world works".&lt;ref name=econ2011&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18441163 |title=Nuclear power: When the steam clears |date=24 March 2011 |work=The Economist |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429091156/http://www.economist.com/node/18441163 |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, German engineering giant [[Siemens]] announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry, as a response to the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14963575 |title=Siemens to quit nuclear industry |date=18 September 2011 |work=BBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204165005/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14963575 |archivedate=4 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company is to boost its work in the [[renewable energy]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,787020,00.html |title=Siemens to Exit Nuclear Energy Business |date=19 September 2011 |work=Spiegel Online |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921152914/http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,787020,00.html |archivedate=21 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=December 2018|reason=Did they?}}  Commenting on the German government's policy to close nuclear plants, Werner Sinn, president of the [[Ifo Institute for Economic Research]] at the [[University of Munich]], stated: "It is wrong to shut down the atomic power plants, because this is a cheap source of energy, and wind and solar power are by no means able to provide a replacement. They are much more expensive, and the energy that comes out is of inferior quality. Energy-intensive industries will move out, and the competitiveness of the [[Manufacturing in Germany|German manufacturing sector]] will be reduced or wages will be depressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/featured-story/428145/the-great-german-energy-experiment/ | title = The Great German Energy Experiment | author = David Talbot | journal = Technology Review | publisher = Massachusetts Institute of Technology | date = July–August 2012 | accessdate = 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Mycle Schneider]] spoke of a global downward trend in the nuclear power industry:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The international nuclear lobby has pursued a 10-year-long, massive propaganda strategy aimed at convincing decision-makers that atomic technology has a bright future as a low-carbon energy option... however, most of the high-flying nuclear plans never materialized. The historic maximum of reactors operating worldwide was achieved in 2002 with 444 units. In the European Union the historic peak was reached as early as 1988 with 177 reactors, of which only 134 are left. The only new projects underway in Europe are heavily over budget and much delayed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As ''Time'' magazine rightly stated in March, "Nuclear power is expanding only in places where taxpayers and ratepayers can be compelled to foot the bill." China is building 27 – or more than 40 percent – of the 65 units officially under construction around the world. Even there, though, nuclear is fading as an energy option. While China has invested the equivalent of about $10 billion per year into nuclear power in recent years, in 2010 it spent twice as much on [[wind energy]] alone and some $54.5 billion on all renewables combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/fukushima-crisis-can-japan-be-the-forefront-of-authentic-paradigm-shift |title=Fukushima crisis: Can Japan be at the forefront of an authentic paradigm shift? |author=Mycle Schneider |date=9 September 2011 |work=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106021131/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/fukushima-crisis-can-japan-be-the-forefront-of-authentic-paradigm-shift |archivedate=6 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast, proponents of nuclear power argue that nuclear power has killed by far the fewest number of people per [[terawatt hour]] of any type of power generation, and it has a very small effect on the environment with effectively zero emissions of any kind. This is argued even taking into account the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents, in which few people were killed directly and few excess cancers will be caused by releases of radioactivity to the environment.

Some proponents acknowledge that most people will not accept this sort of statistical argument nor will they believe reassuring statements from industry or government.  Indeed, the industry itself has created fear of nuclear power by pointing out that radioactivity can be dangerous.  Improved communication by industry might help to overcome current fears regarding nuclear power, but it will be a difficult task to change current perceptions in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=147&amp;storyCode=2061613 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120903195353/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=147&amp;storyCode=2061613 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 3 September 2012 | title = Nuclear as the last resort – why and how? | author = Steve Kidd | publisher = Nuclear Engineering International | date = 19 January 2012 | accessdate = 22 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But with regard to the proposition that "Improved communication by industry might help to overcome current fears regarding nuclear power", Princeton University Physicist [[M. V. Ramana]] says that the basic problem is that there is "distrust of the social institutions that manage nuclear energy", and a 2001 survey by the European Commission found that "only 10.1 percent of Europeans trusted the nuclear industry". This public distrust is periodically reinforced by safety violations by nuclear companies,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} or through ineffectiveness or corruption on the part of nuclear regulatory authorities. Once lost, says Ramana, trust is extremely difficult to regain.&lt;ref name="DoiMissing"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0096340211413358 |title=Nuclear power and the public |year=2011 |last1=Ramana |first1=M. V. |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |volume=67 |issue=4 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Faced with public antipathy, the nuclear industry has "tried a variety of strategies to persuade the public to accept nuclear power", including the publication of  numerous "fact sheets" that discuss issues of public concern.  Ramana says that none of these strategies have been very successful.&lt;ref name="DoiMissing" /&gt;

An '''overtime ban''' is a form of [[industrial action]] where [[employee]]s limit their [[working time]] to the hours specified in their [[Employment contract|contracts]], refusing to work any [[overtime]].  Overtime bans are less disruptive than [[strike action]], and since there is no breach of contract by the employees there is less chance of disciplinary action by the employer than there is with strikes.  However, an overtime ban can have a significant impact on industries which normally operate outside of regular office hours, such as [[emergency services]], [[public transport]], or [[retail]].

An overtime ban is similar to a [[work-to-rule]], in that both involve employees refusing to do more than is strictly required of them.  However, and in contrast with a work-to-rule, when an overtime ban is in place workers may still perform duties not required of them, providing they do not go outside their contracted hours.

Many women from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Eastern Europe]], especially from the [[Ukraine]], work as prostitutes in Croatia.&lt;ref name="continuum" /&gt; Some prostitutes commute to the island of [[Hvar]], which is a popular tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex on Hvar: Local Prostitutes Disappoint Tourists|url=https://www.total-croatia-news.com/hvar-news/4913-sex-on-hvar-local-prostitutes-disappoint-tourists|website=Total Croatia News|accessdate=17 February 2018|language=en-gb|date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the turn of the 20th century, prostitution was legal. In [[Zagreb]] it was advertised as a tourist attraction and contributed to the city's economy. [[Tkalčićeva Street]] was the main centre for brothels. At one stage every other building was a bordello. To open a brothel, the owner had to register at the town hall and received a licence. The licence required the brothel to be well run and provide a quality service. The women working in the brothels had to have a twice weekly medical examination. Brothels were not allowed to advertise their presence, but a discrete, uncommonly coloured lantern was allowed to be placed outside.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution in Croatia: Weird Facts Revealed|url=http://www.croatia-times.com/the-zagreb-times/prostitution-croatia-weird-facts-revealed/|website=Croatia Times|accessdate=17 February 2018|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known brothels in Zagreb were the ''Kod Zelene Lampe'' (Green Lantern's), which was the most expensive, the ''Pick'', and the ''Klub'' which had cabaret until 5 a.m. The ''Bijela Lađa'' ("White Vessel") was known for its mandolin music and fine wine. The Zagreb brothels continued to operate until [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

Following the creation of [[Communism|communist]] [[Yugoslavia]] after WWII, prostitution was made illegal.&lt;ref name="peace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simic|first1=Olivera|title=Regulation of Sexual Conduct in UN Peacekeeping Operations|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783642284847|url=https://books.google.com/?id=l4KwJVeCp14C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=prostitution+in+yugoslavia#v=onepage&amp;q=prostitution%20in%20yugoslavia&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Zagreb became known as the centre of prostitution in Yugoslavia, with the highest number of prostitutes. Women from other areas of Yugoslavia, such as [[Sarajevo]], came to the city because of the higher rates for prostitutes compared to their own areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pimp Zlatko discovered the secret of the city rarely anyone talked about|url=http://www.telegraf.rs/english/2487246-this-was-the-capital-of-prostitution-in-yugoslavia-pimp-zlatko-discovered-the-secret-of-the-city-rarely-anyone-talked-about|website=Telegraf|accessdate=17 February 2018|language=sr|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic crisis,&lt;ref name="peace" /&gt; post-communist turmoil and subsequent arrival of [[United Nations Protection Force|international military personnel]], demand for prostitution rose. The opening of borders allowed foreign prostitutes to come to the country.&lt;ref name="continuum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Francoeur|first1=Robert T.|last2=Noonan|first2=Raymond J.|title=The Continuum Complete International Encyclopedia of Sexuality|date=2004|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780826414885|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dciuj1-F3fYC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;lpg=PA252&amp;dq=Prostitution+in+Croatia#v=onepage&amp;q=Prostitution%20in%20Croatia&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal situation==
Two acts of law criminalise prostitution and related activities. the "Act on the Misdemeanours against Public Peace and Order" criminalises the selling of sex and some third-party involvement. The Criminal Code also makes third-party involvement illegal.&lt;ref name="legal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Framework in Croatia|url=http://www.prostitution-cro-slo.com/en/legal-framework-in-croatia/|publisher=Institute of Social Sciences IVO PILAR and the Peace Institute|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act on the Misdemeanours against Public Peace and Order===
This act was added to Croatian legislation in the year 2000. Article 7 forbids using premises for prostitution and enabling or helping another person to engage in prostitution. The punishment is a fine or up to 60 days' imprisonment. Article 12 forbids 'falling into' prostitution. This is interpreted as repeatedly selling sex. The punishment is a fine or up to 30 days' imprisonment. Additionally, offenders may be made to undergo STI and HIV testing and treatment if infected. They can also be expelled from the area the offence took place in for a period of 30 days to 6 months.&lt;ref name="legal" /&gt;

===Criminal Code===
Since the 1997 Croatian criminal law reform, certain activities related to prostitution were included in the Criminal Code. Trafficking in human beings was added to the code in 2003.&lt;ref name="legal" /&gt;

Within the code, Article 175, "Offences against Sexual Freedom", criminalises organising, inciting a person to, or abetting prostitution. The punishment is 6 months' to 5 years' imprisonment, or 1 to 10 years if there is any compulsion (force, threat, deceit, abuse of power) involved. Article 162, "Section of Offences of Sexual Abuse of Children", increases punishment to 1 to 10 years' imprisonment if children are involved, or to 3 to 15 years if there is also any compulsion.&lt;ref name="legal" /&gt;

===Clients===
Apart from Article 175 of the Criminal Code criminalising purchasing sexual services from underage, coerced or trafficked prostitutes, clients commit no offence.&lt;ref name="legal" /&gt;

In 2012, the [[Ministry of the Interior (Croatia)|Ministry of the Interior]] proposed criminalising clients but this was never presented to the [[Croatian Parliament]]. The Ministry also made similar proposals in May 2016.&lt;ref name="legal" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{main|Human trafficking in Croatia}}

Croatia is a destination, source, and transit country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Migrants in transit, particularly from [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]], are forced into debt bondage by their smugglers to pay off smuggling fees. Croatian women and girls, some of whom respond to false job offers online, are exploited in sex trafficking within the country and elsewhere in Europe. In previous years, traffickers target Croatian girls in state institutions and subjected them to sex trafficking. Women and girls from the [[Balkans]] and [[Central Europe]] are subjected to sex trafficking in Croatia.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Croatia 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271172.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=17 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 105 and 106 of the criminal code criminalise all forms of trafficking and prescribe penalties of one to 15 years' imprisonment. The government investigated seven trafficking cases, the same number investigated in 2015, involving 11 alleged perpetrators. The government prosecuted 11 defendants (five for child sex trafficking, two for sex trafficking, and four for forced labour), compared to four defendants in 2015. Courts convicted seven traffickers (eight in 2015), five of which were appealable verdicts and two were final verdicts with sentences of six years' imprisonment for a sex trafficking case.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

Police identified 17 sex trafficking victims in 2016, compared to 38 sex trafficking victims in 2015. The Ministry of Demography, Family, Youth and Social Policy (MDFYSP) spent approximately 400,000 kunas (US$56,740) to support two shelters and provide monthly [[stipend]]s for victims, compared to 446,541 kunas (US$63,340) in 2015. The government provided shelter for one child, two females, and one male.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Croatia as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

'''Providence''' (officially '''Christian Gospel Mission''') is a Christian [[new religious movement]] founded by Jung Myung-seok in 1980; Jung was formerly a member of the [[Unification movement]] and was strongly influenced by it.  He founded a church that was formerly associated with [[Methodism]] but was expelled from that community.&lt;!--ref name="cheung-southchinamorningpost"/--&gt;&lt;!--ref name="Theological-critique"/--&gt; Most of its members live in [[South Korea]]. Providence has been widely referred to by the media as a [[cult]].

Following accusations against him by South Korean police of rape, fraud, and [[embezzlement]], Jung fled the country in 1999 and lived as a fugitive in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China before being arrested by Chinese police in May 2007.&lt;!--ref name="donga1"/--&gt;&lt;!--ref name="reuters1"/--&gt; In April 2009, after being convicted of rape, the [[Supreme Court of South Korea]] sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment. Jung was released on 18 February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.noted.co.nz/currently/social-issues/cults-nz-providence-infiltrate-nz/|title=The cult that's infiltrated NZ schools, campuses and churches|last=|first=|date=|work=NOTED|accessdate=7 October 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;!--== Alternate names ==--&gt;
The sect has also been called Jesus Morning Star (JMS), Setsuri ("Providence" in Japanese), International Christian Association (ICA), the Morning Star Church (MS Church), the Bright Moon Church, and Ae-chun Church ({{lang|ko|애천교회}}).

=== Sexual abuse allegations in the media ===
The Providence sex scandal received wide public attention following [[Seoul Broadcasting System]] (SBS)'s exposé, broadcast on March 20, 1999 on its TV [[news magazine]], ''{{illm|The Unanswered|ko|그것이 알고 싶다}}''.&lt;ref name ="sakurai-on-sbs&amp;exodus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tamaki" /&gt; Over 100 alleged victims were contacted for information in the making of this series.{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|According to the SBS producer Nam Sang-mun, who later contributed articles in newspaper on the matter.&lt;ref name="mainichi-kokunai-2000" /&gt;}} JMS (as Providence was known then) countered with lawsuits to suppress the broadcast, libel litigation, and an organized two-month barrage of phone calls, as many as 60,000 calls per day.&lt;ref name="mainichi-kokunai-2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yonhap-sbs-iwanttoknow-after-July99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nam-sangmun" /&gt;

Although some of the teachings are a carefully guarded secret within the sect, scholars such as {{illm|Yoshihide Sakurai|ja|櫻井義秀}} who analyzed and summarized the sect's beliefs relied on documented testimonies as well as interviews with ex-members that included victims.{{sfnp|Sakurai|2007c|p=5}} He also obtained notes from ex-members which were used in the "bible study", as instructions in the ''30 lessons'' were conventionally called within the sect.{{sfnp|Sakurai|2007c|p=5}}

== Recruitment ==
Initiates into the sect are initially approached by being invited into an "activity circle", i.e., sports or music clubs in school; the inductees learn only later when taken to "bible study" that religion constitutes part of the "circle" activity.{{sfnp|Sakurai|2006|p=145}} In this manner, Providence forms non-religious organisations for the purpose of attracting young people without initially revealing the religious nature of the group or their real motives,&lt;ref name=ucsd-guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name="asahi-cult-nihon-2000"&gt;{{Cite news

An ex-member in his 30s said he and other cultists were deprived of sleep--forced to work late into the night and then wake up early to listen to Jung's videotaped preaching.

=== Australia ===
Providence began operating in Australia during 1997. Members of Providence have reported to been actively recruiting for new members at the [[Australian National University]]. On April 9, 2014, the Australian government-funded television network [[Special Broadcasting Service]] reported on their activities in Australia, including statements by former members that they sought young attractive women. Providence refused numerous requests for a spokesperson to be interviewed for the program in Australia and Korea. The organization's Chief of External Affairs denied in writing to answer specific questions about the group's Australian activities; however, he did disclose that it had [[Charitable organization#Australia|charitable status]] for tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In May 2016, Australian magazine ''[[Crikey]]'' revealed that an [[Australian Taxation Office]] (ATO) employee had been whitewashing the Wikipedia article on Providence. Operating from a work computer since August 2015, the lawyer had removed negative press coverage from the article and inserted glowing praise of Jung, while casting doubt on Jung's prison conviction. The woman, who denied it at first, eventually admitted that she had made the edits. The ATO's Fraud Prevention and Internal Investigations Unit declined to take any action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Hong Kong ===
Providence has been reported about in Hong Kong, known as The Bright Moon Church there ({{lang|zh|月明教會}}). In October 2006 a former member told ''[[Oriental Daily News]]'' that it has about 100 core members in Hong Kong, including many medical graduates and some assistant professors. Though it has been in Hong Kong for years, its slow development kept it fairly unknown until its media exposure. Providence temporarily created an organization to run various community activities, known as the United Culture and Arts Network (UCAN).&lt;ref name="orientaldailynews2006"&gt;{{cite news

Often I dreaded that some situation would catch me unaware and daub me with the yellow mud of a coward's reputation. I worried that I'd lose my temper, go haywire and end up before the grand jury twisting my uniform buttons nervously and begging for mercy. There was the wear and tear of wondering if the chiefs I served under would let me down when I needed to be backed up. And after I got to be chief, there was never a time when someone didn't hate my guts, and I had to be up on my toes to keep my enemies from feathering my back with knives.&lt;ref name=SEP1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the appointment of Earl Warren to the US Supreme Court a project to collect oral histories from those that knew him was undertaken and Powers was interviewed in Bakersfield. The resulting book was published in 1971.&lt;ref name=OralHistory/&gt; Among the anecdotes he told the interviewer, he remarked on a childhood event he said affected his whole life:

{{quote|I wanted to tell you something… and I think it's affected my whole life, and I don't know if I can tell it very well, but I've thought about it a lot of times.

I can tell how old I was because of where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I was walking down the street and having a hell of a lot of trouble because my shoelaces were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.

And I passed a house, and there was a woman, and I remember that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.

And again I say, these little things that one does - considerate, compassionate, courageous - I guess it's pretty hard to be able to realize the impact they have.&lt;ref name=OralHistory/&gt;{{rp|p.75}}}}

The '''Rumanau''' are an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[ethnic group]] residing in [[Sabah]], eastern [[Malaysia]] on the island of [[Borneo]]. They are known as the '''Lobu''' in the [[Keningau]] District near Lanas, and the '''Rumanau''' in the Masaum, Mangkawagu, Minusu areas of the Kinabatangan District along the [[Kinabatangan River]], in [[Sandakan Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William J. Frawley|title=International Encyclopedia of Linguistics: 4-Volume Set|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=01-951-3977-1|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their population was estimated at 2,800 in the year 1991. They are a sub-group of the [[Kadazan-Dusun]], although their language ([[ISO 639-3]] ruu) belongs to the Paitanic branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family. 

==Etymology==
The Rumanau people derived their name from two words "ru" and "ranah". The word ru is equivalent to the English phrase "to be with" or "to work with", and ranah refers to "wet earth" or "muddy soil". Thus the named Rumanau people means people who work with muddy soil. Wet paddy cultivation is the only known occupation among Kadazan-Dusun which involves "working with muddy soil". The Rumanau were the first ethnic group migrating out from Nunuk Ragang to acquire the skill of wet paddy cultivation. The paddy cultivation phase in [[Momolianism]] evolution had a big impact on the Rumanau people.

Cultural day is observed to display solidarity among the Sindhi-speaking masses; the event is celebrated throughout Sindh and all over the world. The  culture and heritage day was celebrated for the first time on December 6, 2009 (as the Sindhi Topi Day) as a backlash to the comments of anchorperson [[Shahid Masood|Dr. Shahid Masood]] who had criticized President [[Asif Ali Zardari]] for wearing a Sindhi cap on his foreign tours. People across the Sindh province condemned Masood’s comments via SMS, which ultimately resulted in the announcement of celebrating the Sindhi Topi Day. Ever since, Sindhi media groups have also started to celebrate the day as ‘Sindhi Cultural Day’. The Sindhi language TV channels including KTN, Sindh TV, Awaz TV and Mehran TV broadcast live and special programmes on the culture of Sindh, besides these media outlets separately arrange the mega musical events, which also attract large audience to celebrate the Culture Day every year.

The '''Southern Africa Cat Council''' ('''SACC''') is a [[cat registry]] and [[cat fancy]] organisation based in [[South Africa]], affiliating 9 clubs, 14 breed groups and 4 judges panels.

== History ==

SACC was founded in 1945 as the ''Associated Cat Clubs of South Africa'', the first organisation serving the South African cat fancy. In 1996, the members overhauled the organisation's structure and constitution, and adopted the name ''Southern African Cat Council''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tsacc.org.za/index.php/about-sacc|title=About SACC|website=www.tsacc.org.za|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Turks of the Dodecanese''' are a community of 2,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clogg|2002|loc=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkish language|Turkish]]-speaking people and ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]] living on the [[Dodecanese]] islands of [[Rhodes]] ({{lang-tr|Rodos}}) and [[Kos]] ({{lang-tr|İstanköy}}) who were not affected by the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], since the islands were under the rule of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] at the time (from 1912). All inhabitants of the islands became Greek citizens after 1947 when the islands became part of [[Greece]].

As a result of this incorporation into Greece and due to the situation following the [[Cyprus conflict]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 many Muslim Turks left the islands and settled in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helsinki.fi/slavicahelsingiensia/preview/sh41/pdf/3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them were deprived of their Greek citizenship and property.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helsinki.fi/slavicahelsingiensia/preview/sh41/pdf/3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those who stayed abandoned the Turkish language and their religion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helsinki.fi/slavicahelsingiensia/preview/sh41/pdf/3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clave Única de Registro de Población''' (translated into English as '''Unique Population Registry Code''' or else as '''Personal ID Code Number''') (abbreviated '''CURP''') is a unique identity code for both citizens and residents of [[Mexico]]. Each CURP code is a unique [[alphanumeric]] 18-[[character string]] intended to prevent duplicate entries.

==How CURP codes are built==
To understand how CURP codes are built, one must first understand  [[Hispano American naming customs|Hispano American naming conventions]]. Full names in Spanish-speaking countries (including Mexican full names) consist of three elements:

# [[Given name]](s);
# First [[surname]]: the father's first surname; and 
# Second surname: the mother's first surname.

The CURP code is composed of 18 characters that are assigned as follows:
* The first surname's initial and first inside [[vowel]];
* The second surname's initial (or the letter "X" if, like some foreign nationals, the person has no second surname);
* The first given name's initial;
* Date of birth (2 digits for year, 2 digits for month, and 2 digits for day);
* A one-letter gender indicator ('''''H''''' for male (''hombre'' in Spanish) or '''''M''''' for female (''mujer'' in Spanish));
* A two-letter code for the [[States of Mexico|state]] where the person was born; for persons born abroad, the code '''''NE''''' (''nacido en el extranjero'') is used;
* The first surname's second inside consonant;
* The second surname's second inside consonant;
* The first given name's second inside consonant; and
* One character ranging from 0-9 for people born before 2000 or from A-Z for people born since 2000; this is generated by the [[National Population Registry]] to prevent identical entries.
* Control digit, which checks the validity of the previous 17 digits

For married women, only [[Maiden_name#Spanish-speaking_world|maiden name]]s are used.

For example, the CURP code for a hypothetical person named Gloria Hernández García, a female, born on 27 April 1956 in the [[state of Veracruz]], could be '''HEGG560427MVZRRL04'''.

===Exceptions===
Several exceptions to the above rules exist, including:

===="Ñ"====
If any step in the above procedure leads to the letter "''[[Ñ]]''" appearing anywhere in the CURP, the "Ñ" is replaced by an "X".

====Very common given names====

When a person has two given names and the first given name is [[Maria (given name)|María]], as is often the case for women in Mexico, or [[José]], in the case of men, the first name will be overlooked and the fourth character will be taken from the second given name's initial. This is because the names ''María'' and ''José'' are very common and would generate many duplicates if used to generate the code.

For example, if the person were named María Fernanda Escamilla Arroyo, her CURP's first four characters would be '''EAAF''' because ''María'' does not count for the CURP's fourth character when a second given name is present.

====Catalog of Inappropriate Words====
To prevent words from forming that would be deemed ''palabras altisonantes'' (''foul-sounding words'', such as [[profanities|profanity]] or [[pejorative]]s) in the first four characters of the string, a Catalog of Inappropriate Words (''Catálogo de Palabras Inconvenientes'') lists many such possible combinations and provides replacements that usually entail changing the second letter, a vowel, into an "X".

==CURP Card==
===Issuance===
Initially, a CURP card (''cédula'') was obtainable at CURP government offices, and also at the Civil Registry, [[ISSSTE]], [[Mexican Social Security Institute|IMSS]], and other government services; the document was printed on green paper at the time. Valid copies of existing CURPs can now be printed on plain paper by visiting an official [[website]].

While an existing CURP can be looked up using one of the .gob.mx sites listed in the external links, it is not possible to get a CURP issued online. There are advertising sites that will generate a "CURP" look alike. Those sites do not enter a new CURP in the national database, they simply generate a number. Two of those advertising sites are listed below. A new CURP can only be applied for in person at the appropriate government office.

===Description===
The CURP card is 5.4 cm wide and 8.6 cm long, fits in a [[wallet]] and may be [[laminate]]d for preservation. The front of the card gives the CURP 18-character string, given names and surnames, plus the date of registration and a folio number. The back contains information referencing the document used as proof to originally assign the CURP code (if it was a birth certificate, folio number and issuing ''[[Municipalities of Mexico|municipio]]'' are included), and a [[barcode]].

==Use==
On 23 October 1996, the Presidential Agreement for the Adoption and Use of the Population Registry Unique Code by the Federal Government (''Acuerdo Presidencial para la adopción y uso por la Administración Pública Federal de la Clave Única de Registro de Población'') was published in the ''[[Official Gazette of the Federation (Mexico)|Official Gazette of the Federation]]''.

The Agreement provides assigning a CURP number to everyone living in Mexico and to Mexicans living abroad.

Currently, the CURP is essential for [[tax filing]]s, to keep records of [[company|companies]], schools, membership in government-run health services, [[passport]] [[wikt:application|application]]s, and other government services.

CURP number is now used in all Civil Registry individual records ([[birth certificate|birth]] and [[death certificate]]s) and certified copies thereof.

Although primarily intended to substitute for a series of registration numbers (IMSS, RFC, IFE), CURP has failed to replace any of these, which continue to use their own code-generation protocols. Nevertheless, INE voting card now contains both the IFE code and the CURP code.

==CRIP==
Outside [[Mexico City]], the ''Clave de Registro e Identidad Personal'' ([[Personal Registration and Identification Code]]) ([[Clave de Registro de Identidad Personal|CRIP]]) is used, in addition to CURP.

==CUI==
It has been proposed the creation of a Unique Identity Code (CUI) that could possibly replace the CURP, to unify the system throughout Mexico.

Active warfare throughout [[recorded history]] has predominantly involved male combatants; however, women have also contributed to military activities including as combatants.  The following list describes women known to have participated in military actions in the 18th century.

For women in warfare in the United States at this time, please see [[Timeline of women in war in the United States, Pre-1945]].

&lt;!--Please respect the fact that this list is relevant only if it is a list of exceptions, which is to women who actually participated in active warfare, such as female warriors. Female monarchs who declared war are not exceptions in any way and their presence endangers this list to be deleted for not being relevant. The text MUST actually therefore be about female warriors, otherwise all female monarchs can be included, which would make this list pointless and liable to deletion --&gt;

'''Women letter writers''' in early modern Europe created lengthy correspondences, where they expressed their intellect and their creativity; in the process, they also left a rich historic legacy.

Over time, a large number of women's correspondences have been made the subject of publications. Some among them ignored the literary value of these missives that were sometimes circulated by their recipients. Some correspondences were, on the other hand, strictly private and their literary value—and historic value, as well—was not revealed until the rediscovery of these letters, perhaps long after the death of their authors, as in the case of [[Élisabeth Bégon]], whose correspondence was not discovered until 1932 in the archives of the French Ministry of the Navy.

It is usually agreed that what makes these letters distinctive emanates from their spontaneity. [[Marie de Sévigné]] was the incarnation of this quality, to the point of becoming considered by many as the archetype of the woman letter writer, and an altogether literary author, even among her contemporaries, such as [[Suzanne Curchod]]: {{Blockquote|It is this precious collection that seems to flow into the reputation of all women: because it is always repeated, ever since Madame de Sévigné, that women write better than men and that they feel things more delicately than them. &lt;small&gt;[[Suzanne Curchod]]&lt;/small&gt;}}

In 1669, the famous ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun]]'' appeared, presented as a translation of five letters sent by a Portuguese nun to a French officer. For a long time, these letters were accepted as authentic letters written by Mariana Alcoforado, before being definitively shown by a modern critic to be a work of literary fiction, attributed to [[Gabriel de Guilleragues]].

The frontier between reality and fiction becomes blurry between literature and correspondence, above all when novelists turned this writing technique into a literary device that would become the [[epistolary novel]], a genre that reached its peak during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] when writers tried to persuade readers that between their hands was a real correspondence, which is what [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] more or less achieved with ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]''.
