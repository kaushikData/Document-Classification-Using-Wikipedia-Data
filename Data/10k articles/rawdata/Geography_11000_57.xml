'''1020 Arcadia''', provisional designation {{mp|1924 QV}}, is a stony Agnia [[asteroid]] from the central regions of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=off|sigfig=1|sp=us}} in diameter. It was discovered on 7 March 1924, by German astronomer [[Karl Reinmuth]] at the [[Heidelberg Observatory]] in Heidelberg, Germany.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; The asteroid was named after the Greek region of [[Arcadia]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''Arcadia'' is a member of the [[Agnia family]] ({{small|[[FIN tbl#514|514]]}}),&lt;ref name="Ferret" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sunshine-2004" /&gt; a very large [[Asteroid family|family]] of stony asteroids with more than 2000 known members.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny-2014" /&gt; They most likely formed from the breakup of a [[basalt]] object, which in turn was spawned from a larger [[parent body]] that underwent [[igneous differentiation]].&lt;ref name="Sunshine-2004" /&gt; The family's parent body and namesake is the asteroid [[847&amp;nbsp;Agnia]].&lt;ref name="Nesvorny-2014" /&gt;

It orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|central]] main-belt at a distance of 2.7–2.9&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 4 years and 8 months (1,703 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 2.79&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.04 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 4[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The body's [[observation arc]] begins at Heidelberg in March 1924, six days after its official discovery observation.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

In the [[SMASS classification]], ''Arcadia'' is a common, stony [[S-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; It has been characterized as an S-type by [[Pan-STARRS]] photometric survey,&lt;ref name="Veres-2015" /&gt; as well as by [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]]-MFB (Masi Foglia Bus).&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

=== Rotation period ===

In November 2011, a fragmentary rotational [[lightcurve]] of ''Arcadia'' was obtained from photometric observations by Gordon Gartrelle at the [[University of North Dakota]]. Lightcurve analysis gave a [[rotation period]] of 17.02 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.05 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=1]]}}).&lt;ref name="Gartrelle-2012" /&gt; As of 2018, no secure period has been obtained.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by the [[NEOWISE]] mission of NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]], ''Arcadia'' measures between 10.067 and 13.02 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] between 0.150 and 0.2364.&lt;ref name="Masiero-2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WISE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masiero-2012" /&gt; The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes an albedo 0.057, i.e. an albedo for a [[C-type asteroid|carbonaceous]] rather than for a stony asteroid, and consequently calculates a much larger diameter of 21.16 kilometers based on an [[absolute magnitude]] of 12.1.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt; It may be speculated whether this anomaly is a glitch in the data base.

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named after named after the Greek region of [[Arcadia]] in central [[Peloponnese]]. It is also a [[Arcadia (ancient region)|celebrated mythological region]], where the shepherd god [[Pan (god)|Pan]] lived. The official naming citation was mentioned in ''[[The Names of the Minor Planets]]'' by [[Paul Herget]] in 1955 ({{small|[[Herget's discovery circumstances|H 97]]}}).&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3263">The '''African Surface''' or '''African Erosion Surface''' is a land [[erosion surface|surface formed by erosion]] covering large swathes of Africa.&lt;ref name=AAA&gt;Burke &amp; Gunnell 2008, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The type area of the surface lies in [[South Africa]] where  the surface was first identified as such by [[Lester Charles King]] in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=BurkeGunnell13-14&gt;Burke &amp; Gunnell 2008, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by King for certain high surfaces in [[Southern Africa]]. Over the years he redefined it various times leaving some confusion not on its reality but on the matter of its precise meaning and extent.&lt;ref name=BurkeGunnell13-14/&gt;&lt;ref name=BurkeGunneX1&gt;Burke &amp; Gunnell 2008, pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke and Gunnell redefined it as a composite surface.&lt;ref name=Guillocheau2017/&gt; According to Guillocheau ''et al''. (2008) the African Surface is made up by [[etchplain]]s formed between 70 and 40 million years ago. In this sense the existence of parts of the African Surface at different elevations is the result of continental-scale [[deformation (geology)|warping]] due to [[mantle (geology)|endogenic forces]].&lt;ref name=Guillocheau2017&gt;{{cite journal|author-last=Guillocheau |author-first=François |author-last2=Simon |author-first2=Brendon |author-last3=Baby |author-first3=Guillaume |author-last4=Bessin |author-first4=Paul |author-last5=Robin|author-first5=Cécile|author-last6=Dauteuil|author-first6=Olivier |date=2017|title=Planation surfaces as a record of mantle dynamics: The case example of Africa  |journal= [[Gondwana Research]]|number=|pages= 82–98|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2017.05.015 |volume=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Africa the African Surface can be found in uplifted position in several domes and elongated bulges between these domes and also in downwarped basins. The domes include the East African, [[Ethiopian highlands|Ethiopian]], Cameroon and Angola. The Central African Atlantic Swell and the Central African Rise. Subdued regions include the [[Congo Basin]] where the African Surface lies about 300 m a.s.l. and the Turkana Gap.&lt;ref name=Guillocheau2017/&gt; In the interior of Western Africa the so-called [[Bauxite|Bauxitic]] Surface has been identified as equivalent to the African Surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-last=Beauvais|author-first=A.|author-last2=Ruffet|author-first2=G. |author-last3=Henócque|author-first3=O.|author-last4=Colin|author-first4=F.|date= 2008|title=Chemical and physical erosion rhythms of the West African Cenozoic morphogenesis: The 39Ar-40Ar dating of supergene K-Mn oxides. |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|number=113|pages=F04007 |doi=10.1029/2008jf000996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aufeis''', ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aʊ|f|aɪ|s}} {{respell|OW|fyse}}), ([[German language|German]] for "ice on top") is a sheet-like mass of layered [[ice]] that forms from successive flows of ground water during freezing temperatures. This form of ice is also called '''overflow''', '''icings''', or the [[Russian language|Russian]] term, '''naled'''. The term was first used in 1859 by A. T. von Middendorff following his observations of the phenomenon in northern [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name="Ashton"&gt;Ashton, George D. 1986. River and lake ice engineering. Chelsea, Michigan, USA: Book Crafters, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leffingwell |first=Ernest de K. |date=1919 |title=The Canning River region, northern Alaska |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |volume=Professional Paper 109 |p=158 |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/0109/report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
[[Image:Aufeis far.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A sheet of aufeis in a glacial valley in Mongolia]] 
Aufeis accumulates during winter along [[stream]] and [[river]] [[valley]]s in [[arctic]] and [[subarctic]] environments. It forms by upwelling of river water behind [[Ice jam|ice dam]]s, or by ground-water discharge. The latter mechanism prevails in high-gradient [[alpine climate|alpine]] streams as they [[freezing|freeze]] solid. Ground-water discharge is blocked by ice, perturbing the steady-state condition and causing a small incremental rise in the local [[water table]] until discharge occurs along the bank and over the top of the previously formed ice. Successive ice layers can lead to aufeis accumulations that are several meters thick. Aufeis typically melts out during summer and will often form in the same place year after year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=Xiaogang |last2=Pollard |first2=Wayne H. |date=September 1997 |title=The Hydrologic Analysis and Modeling of River Icing Growth, North Fork Pass, Yukon Territory, Canada |journal=[[Permafrost and Periglacial Processes]] |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=279–294 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1530(199709)8:3&lt;279::AID-PPP260&gt;3.0.CO;2-7 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1530(199709)8:3%3C279::AID-PPP260%3E3.0.CO;2-7/pdf |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aufeis in the Brooks Range of Alaska.JPG|thumb|left|Backpackers cross a sheet of aufeis in the [[Anaktuvuk River]] Valley of Alaska]]
Sheets of aufeis may block stream channels and cause their [[flood plains]] to widen as spring floodwaters are forced to flow around the ice.&lt;ref name=Harden&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harden |first1=Deborah |last2=Barnes |first2=Peter |last3=Reimnitz |first3=Erk |date=1977 |title=Distribution and character of naleds in northeastern Alaska |journal=Arctic |volume=30 |issue=1 |pp=28–40 |url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/download/2681/2658 |doi=10.14430/arctic2681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on aufeis has to a large extent been motivated by the variety of engineering problems the ice sheets can cause (e.g. blocking drainages and causing flooding of roads).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kane |first1=Douglas L. |date=1981 |title=Physical mechanics of aufeis growth |journal=Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=186–195 |url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/l81-026 |doi=10.1139/l81-026}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Culvert]]s and pipelines can actually help to block flow and lead to the development of more extensive aufeis.&lt;ref&gt;Williams and Smith{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aufeis can present an extreme danger to recreational boaters even during summer months, who can find themselves trapped between walls of ice or pulled under aufeis by the current of the river. Breaking dams of aufeis can also cause flash floods downriver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Alaska.org |title=Dangers of Aufeis on Alaskan Rivers |url=http://www.alaska.org/advice/aufeis-on-the-alaskan-rivers |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper scouting and precautions when choosing campsites can minimize these risks {{Citation needed|reason=appears to be original research|date=June 2017}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22539">'''Copper mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo''' mainly takes place in the [[Copper Belt]] of the southern [[Katanga Province]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name=Mbendi/&gt;

==Geology==

The Katanga, or Shaba, copperbelt in the DRC is a belt about {{convert|70|km|mi}} wide and {{convert|250|km|mi}} long between [[Lubumbashi]] and [[Kolwezi]] formed in rocks of the [[Katanga Supergroup]]. There are 72 economic deposits of copper/cobalt and four large mining centers.{{sfn|Laznicka|2010|p=441}} Taken together, the DRC and Zambian copper belts are the second largest global reserve of copper, about 1/3 the size of the Chilean reserve.&lt;ref name=MetorexV/&gt;

The DRC copper belt includes some of the highest grade copper deposits in the world. In some reserves the grades are above 5%. The ore also has high grades of cobalt and may hold 34% of the world's cobalt reserves. There are large deposits that have yet to be explored using modern technology, so the size of the reserves may be understated. Demand is growing, led by China.&lt;ref name=MetorexV/&gt;

==History==

Prehistoric mines in the Katanga belt have been found at Dikuluwe near [[Musonoi]], Tenke-Fungurume, [[Kambove mines|Kambove]], [[Luishia Mine|Luishia]], Ruashi and Etoile, and at the Naviundo and Luano archaeological sites.{{sfn|Bisson|Vogel|2000|p=116}}  Monseigneur de Hemptinne watched [[Yeke people]] working at Dikuluwe as late as 1924. They worked in the dry season and stopped when the first rains arrived. The mining camp was near a stream where [[millet]] could be planted.  Women and children collected [[malachite]] from the surface, while men used iron picks to excavate pits and shafts, using  fire to crack the rocks when needed. The mines were between {{convert|10|m|ft}} and {{convert|15|m|ft}} deep with galleries up to {{convert|20|m|ft}} long. The ore would be sorted and then taken to a nearby stream for concentration before being smelted.{{sfn|Bisson|Vogel|2000|p=92}}

Commercial mining began in the 1920s, with a forcibly recruited workforce. The [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga|Union Minière]] constantly struggled to prevent recruits fleeing from the mines, sometimes taking refuge in Angola.{{sfn|Higginson|1989|p=53}} Workers were mistreated and suffered badly from disease brought on by the working conditions.  The lowest death rate at the Panda, Lubumbashi, Kisanga and Musonoi work sites in 1928 was four men per month.{{sfn|Higginson|1989|p=56}} Today, mine worker exploitation is still prevalent and instances of slave labor, and especially [[child labor]], are still observed in the mining industry according to the 2014 [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]''.

Between 1970 and 1988 copper metal production was roughly constant at between 400,000 and 500,000 tonnes. Production then dropped steeply to under 50,000 tonnes annually between 1992 and 2001. Since then, production has steadily grown, reaching about 300,000 tonnes in 2008.&lt;ref name=MetorexV/&gt;

In 2005, proceeds from an oil sale to [[Glencore]], an Anglo–Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company, were seized as fraudulent gains as part of an investigation into corruption in the country (Allen-Mills 17 June 2008).&lt;ref name=AustralianNews20080617&gt;{{cite news|first=Tony|last=Allen-Mills|title=Congo sapped of riches as Denis menaces Boulevard Saint-Germain|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,23873480-643,00.html|work=The Australian |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the Congo events, Nikanor was merged into Katanga in late 2007 in a transaction valued at US$3.3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pagnamenta, Robin |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/natural_resources/article2820766.ece |title=Nikanor and Katanga Mining merge to create $3.3bn African giant |work=The London Times |date=7 November 2007 |accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of the DRC began to review about 60 mining contracts in 2008, and started to release their findings to the mining companies in February 2008.
For example, TEAL, a subsidiary of [[African Rainbow Minerals]], was asked by letter to submit their feasibility study for their [[Kalumines]] property to identify the real contribution of each of the parties "in order to achieve a fair attribution of shares".
The letter said the feasibility study should present a planning of "realisation of social actions with a visible impact".
It also said that the state-owned [[Gécamines]] should actively participate in the daily management of the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In August 2009, the DRC government revoked [[First Quantum Minerals]]' (FQM) license to operate the [[Kolwezi tailings project]], alleging "unreasonable behaviour" in negotiations to change the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

First Quantum had spent $750 million on acquiring and developing the property.
First Quantum took out an action against the DRC government in the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] Court of Arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In May 2010 a Congolese court ruled that FQM's [[Lonshi Mine|Lonshi]] and [[Frontier Mine, Katanga|Frontier]] copper mines had been awarded illegally and that they should revert to state-owned [[Sodimico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to FQM the ruling was due to FQM's decision to contest the expropriation of their Kolwezi project, which was later sold to the Kazakh mining company [[Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation]].&lt;ref name=Reuters20110817&gt;{{cite news

==Companies==
Many companies are involved in different aspects of copper mining in the DRC, and the names change constantly due to start-ups, acquisitions and divestitures. The list of companies participating in the industry that follows is incomplete.

===Gécamines===
{{main|Gécamines}}
[[Gécamines]] (La Générale des Carrières et des Mines), is a state-owned mining company in the DRC. Its principal products are copper (which often accounted for 50% of export earnings), [[cobalt]] and [[zinc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.gecamines.cd/
 |title=La Générale des Carrières et des Mines
 |publisher=La Générale des Carrières et des Mines
 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Copper mines in which Gécamines has a major interest include [[Kambove mines|Kambove]], [[Kipushi mine|Kipushi]] and [[Kolwezi mine|Kolwezi]]. Gécamines also owns a copper smelter at [[Lubumbashi]] and a hydrometallurgical plant at [[Shituru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Damhus Lake''' ({{lang-da|Damhussøen}} or ''{{lang|da|Damhus Sø}}'') is a lake located just north of [[Roskildevej]], between [[Rødovre]], [[Vanløse]] and [[Frederiksberg]], on the western outskirts of inner [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. '''Damhus Meadow''' ({{lang-da|Damhusengen|links=no}}), once a part of the lake, is located on the north side of the lake.

==History==
Damhus Lake is an [[artificial lake]] which was created some time during the Middle Ages when a dam was built on [[Harrestrup River]] (Harrestrup Å). The first known reference to it is from 1561 when king [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederick II]] gives it to the [[University of Copenhagen]]. From 1618, the lake played a role in Copenhagen's water supply. It was then known as Langevadsdam. The name referred to the "Lange vad" ("long [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]") to the south of the lake. The lake's current southern shoreline was defined in 1620&amp;ndash;21 when an embankment was built across marshy stretch for the new [[Roskildevej|Roskilde Road]]. The aim of the embankment was not only to protect the road against flooding but also to secure a more stable supply of water to Copenhagen by raising the water level in the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://valbybydel.dk/Damhussoen/damhussoen.htm|title=Søens historie og miljøtilstand|language=Danish|website=valbybydel.dk|accessdate=2 February 2015}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The water drained into [[The Lakes, Copenhagen|St. Jørgen's Lake]] closter to the city through the artificial [[Åboulevard|Ladegård Canal]].

The Roskilde Road was a [[toll road]] until 1915,&lt;ref name="bomhus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roskildehistorie.dk/gader/Koebenhavnsvej/bomhuse/bomhus.htm |title=Bomhus|date= |website=Roskildes Historie |publisher= |language=Danish |access-date=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A building at the southwestern corner of the lake, Langevadsdamhuset, colloquially known as Damhuset, served as [[toll house]]. The lake gradually got its contemporary name from this toll house around 1800.

In 1849, a new embankment was constructed across the lake, separating it in two. In the 1920s and 1930s, Harestrup Å caused frequent floodings and it had also become known for its unpleasant odeur. In 1938 it was therefore decided to regulate it in connection with the city's establishment of the new public park Vigerslevparken. The stream was disconnected from the northern part of the lake, known as Bagsøen ("The Rear Lake"), which was drained and converted ito present-day Damhusengen (Damhus Meadow). In 1941, both lake and meadow were given status as public park. They were protected by the Conservation Authority in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fredninger.dk/fredning/harrestrup-aa/|title=Harrestrup Å og Damhussøen|language=Danish|publisher=Danmarks Naturfredningsforening|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eratosthenes Seamount''' is a [[seamount]] in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] about 100&amp;nbsp;km south of western [[Cyprus]].  It is a large, submerged [[massif]], about 120&amp;nbsp;km long and 80&amp;nbsp;km wide.  Its peak lies at the depth of 690 m and it rises 2000 m above the surrounding seafloor, which is located at the depth of up to 2,700 m and is a part of the [[Eratosthenes Abyssal Plain]].  It is one of the largest features on the Eastern Mediterranean seafloor.

In 2010 and 2012 the [[Ocean Exploration Trust]]'s vessel [[EV Nautilus]] explored the seamount looking for shipwrecks. Three were found; two were [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] vessels from the 19th century and the third was from the [[4th century BC]]. Such seamounts are considered to be ideal for the preservation of shipwrecks because at depths of around 600&amp;nbsp;metres the areas are not disturbed by [[Fishing trawler|trawler]]s or by sediments coming off land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Learn|first1=Joseph Rapp|title=Wayfarers of the ancient world|journal=New Scientist|date=9 December 2017|volume=236|issue=3155|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''first [[European colonialism|European colonization]] wave''' took place from the early 15th century ([[Battle of Ceuta|Portuguese conquest of Ceuta]] in 1415) until the early 19th-century ([[French conquest of Algeria|French invasion of Algeria]] in 1830), and primarily involved the [[European colonization of the Americas]], though it also included the establishment of [[European colonies in India]] and in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. During this period, European interests in Africa primarily focused on the establishment of trading posts there, particularly for the [[African slave trade]].

The time period in which much of the first wave of European colonization (and other exploratory ventures) occurred is often labeled the [[Age of Discovery]]. A [[New Imperialism|later major phase]] of European colonization, which started in the late 19th-century and primarily focused on Africa and Asia, is known as the period of [[New Imperialism]].

==The Role of the Church ==
{{Main|Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery}}

Religious zeal played a large role in Spanish and Portuguese overseas activities.  While the [[Pope]] himself was a political power to be heeded (as evidenced by his authority to decree whole continents open to colonization by particular kings), the Church also sent [[missionary|missionaries]] to convert the indigenous peoples of other continents to the [[Catholicism|Catholic faith]]. 
Thus, the 1455 [[Papal Bull]] [[Romanus Pontifex]] granted the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] all lands behind [[Cape Bojador]] and allowed them to reduce pagans and other enemies of Christ to perpetual slavery.&lt;ref name="Daus_33"&gt;{{cite book

 | year =1983  
 | location =Wuppertal/Germany  
 | isbn =3-87294-202-6| page =33|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the 1481 [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Aeterni regis]]'' granted all lands south of the [[Canary Islands]] to [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], while in May 1493 the Spanish-born [[Pope Alexander VI]] decreed in the Bull ''[[Inter caetera]]'' that all lands west of a meridian only 100 leagues west of the [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]] Islands should belong to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] while new lands discovered east of that line would belong to Portugal. These arrangements were later precised with the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].

The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Jesuits]], notably [[Francis Xavier]] in Asia, were particularly active in this endeavour.  Many buildings erected by the Jesuits still stand, such as the [[Ruins of St. Paul's|Cathedral of Saint Paul]] in [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] and the [[La Santisima Trinidad de Paraná|Santisima Trinidad de Paraná]] in [[Paraguay]], an example of a [[Jesuit Reductions|Jesuit Reduction]].

Spanish treatment of the indigenous populations provoked a fierce debate at home in 1550–51, dubbed the [[Valladolid debate]], over whether Indians possessed souls and if so, whether they were entitled to the basic rights of mankind. [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], author of ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'', championed the cause of the natives, and was opposed by [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda|Sepúlveda]], who claimed [[Amerindians]] were "natural slaves".

The [[School of Salamanca]], which gathered theologians such as [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (1480–1546) or [[Francisco Suárez]] (1548–1617), argued in favor of the existence of [[natural law]], which thus gave some rights to indigenous people. However, while the School of Salamanca limited [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s imperial powers over colonized people, they also legitimized the conquest, defining the conditions of "[[Just War]]". For example, these theologians admitted the existence of the right for indigenous people to reject [[religious conversion]], which was a novelty for Western philosophical thought. However, Suárez also conceived many particular cases &amp;mdash; a [[casuistry]] &amp;mdash; in which conquest was legitimized. Hence, war was justified if the indigenous people refused free transit and commerce to the Europeans; if they forced converts to return to [[idolatry]]; if there come to be a sufficient number of Christians in the newly discovered land that they wish to receive from the Pope a Christian government; if the indigenous people lacked just laws, magistrates, agricultural techniques, etc. In any case, title taken according to this principle must be exercised with Christian [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], warned Suárez, and for the advantage of the Indians. Henceforth, the School of Salamanca legitimized the conquest while at the same time limiting the absolute power of the [[head of state|sovereign]], which was celebrated in others parts of Europe under the notion of the [[Divine right of kings|divine right]] of kings.

In the 1970s, the Jesuits would become a main proponent of the [[Liberation theology]] which openly supported anti-imperialist movements. It was officially condemned in 1984 and in 1986 by then Cardinal Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) as the head of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], under charges of [[Marxism|Marxist tendencies]], while [[Leonardo Boff]] was suspended.

It was not long before the exclusivity of Iberian claims to the Americas was challenged by other European powers, primarily the Netherlands, France and England: the view taken by the rulers of these nations is epitomized by the quotation attributed to [[Francis I of France]] demanding to be shown the clause in [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]'s will excluding his authority from the New World.

This challenge initially took the form of [[privateer]]ing raids (such as that led by [[Francis Drake]]) on Spanish treasure fleets or coastal settlements, but later, Northern European countries began establishing settlements of their own, primarily in areas that were outside of Spanish interests, such as what is now the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada, or islands in the Caribbean, such as [[Aruba]], [[Martinique]] and [[Barbados]], that had been abandoned by the Spanish in favour of the mainland and larger islands.

Whereas Spanish colonialism was based on the religious conversion and exploitation of local populations via [[encomienda]]s (many Spaniards emigrated to the Americas to elevate their social status, and were not interested in manual labour), Northern [[European colonialism]] was frequently bolstered by people fleeing religious persecution or intolerance (for example, the [[Mayflower]] voyage).  The motive for emigration was not to become an aristocrat nor to spread one's faith but to start afresh in a new society, where life would be hard but one would be free to exercise one's religious beliefs.  The most populous emigration of the 17th century was that of the English, and after a series of wars with the Dutch and the French the [[English overseas possessions]] came to dominate the east coast of North America, an area stretching from [[Virginia Colony|Virginia]] northwards to [[New England]] and [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]], although during the 17th century an even greater number of English emigrants settled in the [[West Indies]].

However, the English, French and Dutch were no more averse to making a profit than the Spanish and Portuguese, and whilst their areas of settlement in the Americas proved to be devoid of the precious metals found by the Spanish, trade in other commodities and products that could be sold at massive profit in Europe provided another reason for crossing the Atlantic, in particular [[fur]]s from Canada, [[tobacco]] and [[cotton]] grown in [[Virginia]] and [[sugar]] in the islands of the Caribbean and [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]].  Due to the massive depletion of indigenous labour, plantation owners had to look elsewhere for manpower for these labour-intensive crops.  They turned to the centuries-old slave trade of west Africa and began transporting humans across the Atlantic on a massive scale – historians estimate that the [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought between 10 and 12 million individuals to the New World.  The islands of the Caribbean soon came to be populated by slaves of African descent, ruled over by a white minority of plantation owners interested in making a fortune and then returning to their home country to spend it.

==Rule in the colonies: the ''Leyes de Burgos'' and the ''Code Noir'' ==
{{main|Leyes de Burgos|Valladolid Controversy|Code Noir|Laws of the Indies}}

The January 27, 1512 ''[[Leyes de Burgos]]'' codified the government of the indigenous people of the New World, since the common law of Spain wasn't applied in these recently discovered territories. The scope of the laws were originally restricted to the island of [[Hispaniola]], but were later extended to [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Jamaica]]. They authorized and legalized the colonial practice of creating ''[[encomiendas]]'', where Indians were grouped together to work under colonial masters, limiting the size of these establishments to a minimum of 40 and a maximum of 150 people. The document finally prohibited the use of any form of punishment by the ''encomenderos'', reserving it for officials established in each town for the implementation of the laws. It also ordered that the Indians be catechesized, outlawed [[bigamy]], and required that the huts and cabins of the Indians be built together with those of the Spanish. It respected, in some ways, the traditional authorities, granting chiefs exemptions from ordinary jobs and granting them various Indians as servants. The poor fulfilment of the laws in many cases lead to inummerable protests and claims. In fact, the laws were so often poorly applied that they were seen as simply a legalization of the previous poor situation. This would create momentum for reform, carried out through the ''[[Leyes Nuevas]]'' ("New Laws") in 1542. Ten years later, [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Dominican friar|friar]] [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] would publish ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'', in the midst of the [[Valladolid Controversy]], a debate about the existence or not of [[souls]] in [[Amerindians]] bodies. Las Casas, bishop of [[Chiapas]], was opposed to [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda|Sepúlveda]], who claimed [[Amerindians]] were "natural slaves"...

In the [[French colonial empires|French empire]], [[slavery|slave trade]] and other colonial rules were regulated by [[Louis XIV]]'s 1689 ''[[Code Noir]]''.

==Role of companies in early colonialism ==
From its very outset, Western colonialism was operated as a joint public-private venture.  Columbus' voyages to the Americas were partially funded by Italian investors, but whereas the Spanish state maintained a tight rein on trade with its colonies (by law, the colonies could only trade with one designated port in the mother country and treasure was brought back in special [[Spanish treasure fleet|convoys]]), the English, French and Dutch granted what were effectively trade [[monopolies]] to [[Joint stock company|joint-stock companies]] such as the [[East India Company|East India Companies]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. The [[Massachusetts Bay Company]], founded in 1628/9, swiftly established a form of self-governance following the [[Cambridge Agreement]] of August 1629, whereby subsequent meetings of the board of governors took place in Massachusetts itself.

== European colonies in India during the first wave of colonization ==
{{main|European colonies in India}}

In 1498, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] arrived in [[Goa]]. Rivalry among reigning European powers saw the entry of the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], [[British India|British]], [[French India|French]], [[Danish India|Danish]] among others. The fractured debilitated kingdoms of [[History of India|India]] were gradually taken over by the Europeans and indirectly controlled by puppet rulers. In 1600, Queen [[Elizabeth I]] accorded a [[charter]], forming the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] to trade with India and eastern Asia. The British landed in India in [[Surat]] in 1624. By the 19th century, they had assumed direct and indirect control over most of India.

== Destruction of the Amerindian population ==

{{main|Population history of American indigenous peoples}}

The arrival of the ''[[conquistadores]]'' caused the annihilation of most of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]]. However, contemporary historians now generally reject the [[Black Legend]] according to which the brutality of the European colonists accounted for most of the deaths. It is now generally believed that [[diseases]], such as the [[smallpox]], brought upon by the [[Columbian Exchange]], were the greatest destroyer, although the brutality of the conquest itself isn't contested. Genocidal policies were more common in post-colonial states, notably in 19th century United States and [[Argentina]] where indigenous populations were systematically exterminated. For example, [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], [[Argentina|Argentinian]] ''[[caudillo]]'' from 1829 to 1852, openly pursued the extermination of the local population, an event related by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] in ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'' (1839). He was then followed by the "[[Conquest of the Desert]]" in the 1870–80s. The result was the death of a lot of  the mapuche and arauccan population in the Patagonia. After the Amerindians' quasi-total disparition, the mines and the [[sugar cane]] [[plantations]] thus led to the booming of the Atlantic slave trade, especially apparent in the Caribbean where the largest ethnic group is of African descent.

Contemporary historians debate the legitimacy of calling the quasi-disparition of the Amerindians a "[[genocide]]". Estimates of [[pre-Columbian]] population have ranged from a low of 8.4 million to a high of 112.5 million persons; in 1976, geographer [[William Denevan]] derived a "consensus count" of about 54 million people.&lt;ref&gt;20th century estimates in Thornton, Russell. ''American Indian Holocaust and Survival: A Population History Since 1492''. University of Oklahoma Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0-8061-2074-6}}, p. 22; [http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/kolp/HH345/PRE1492.HTM Denevan's consensus count]; [http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#America recent lower estimates]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--- current estimates of Amerindian population welcome in order to give sense to these numbers ---&gt;

[[David Stannard]] has argued that "The destruction of the Indians of the Americas was, far and away, the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world", with almost 100 million Amerindians killed in what he calls the ''American Holocaust''. Like [[Ward Churchill]], he believes that the American natives were deliberately and systematically exterminated over the course of several centuries, and that the process continues to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Stannard|Stannard, David E]]. ''[[American Holocaust]]: The Conquest of the New World''. Oxford University Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-19-508557-4}}; p. x (quotation), p. 151 (death toll estimate).&lt;/ref&gt;

Stannard's claim of 100 million deaths has been disputed because he makes no distinction between death from violence and death from disease. In response, [[political science|political scientist]] [[R. J. Rummel]] has instead estimated that over the centuries of European colonization about 2 million to 15 million American indigenous people were the victims of what he calls ''[[democide]].'' "Even if these figures are remotely true", writes Rummel, "then this still make this subjugation of the Americas one of the bloodier, centuries long, democides in world history." &lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[R. J. Rummel]]'s quote and estimate from [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/DBG.CHAP3.HTM his website], about midway down the page, after footnote 82. Rummel's estimate is presumably not a single democide, but a total of multiple democides, since there were many different governments involved.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic pursuit and treatment of slaves  ==
Spain and Portugal sought the utilization of foreign and indigenous peoples during post colonial contact with the New World. The Portuguese and Spanish use of slavery in Latin America was seen as a lucrative business which ultimately led to internal and external development in gaining economic influence at any cost. The economic pursuits of the Spanish and Portuguese empires ushered in the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade.

In the fifteenth century, Portugal shifted its attention to the latter economic endeavor. Their ships sailed from the borders of the Sahara desert to the entirety of the West African coast.&lt;ref name="Newson"&gt;Newson, Linda A., and Susie Minchin. ''From Capture to Sale the Portuguese Slave Trade to Spanish South America in the Early Seventeenth Century''. Leiden: Brill, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}} At the outset of the Atlantic Slave Trade, Manuel Bautista Pérez, a notable Portuguese slave trader, gives insight to the amount and treatment of the African slaves. Pérez and his men conducted slave trading in which thousands of African peoples were bought from local tribal leaders and transported across the Atlantic to South America. In contrast from popular belief, Portuguese slave traders did not acquire slaves in a forceful manner. According to documents written by Manuel Pérez, slaves were only made available by certain conditions. The most notable condition was bartering “items that the leaders wanted and were interested in”.&lt;ref name="Newson"/&gt;{{rp|39}} Items such as bread, coal, precious stones, and firearms were provided in exchange for slaves. Furthermore, local tribal leaders did not simply give up their own people for the aforementioned commodities but rather through intertribal wars, debts, and civil crime offenders.&lt;ref name="Newson"/&gt;{{rp|54}}

Labor in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies became scarce. European diseases and forced labor began killing the indigenous people in insurmountable numbers. Therefore, slaves were seen only as a business venture due to the labor shortages. These slaves were forced to work in jobs such as agriculture and mining. According to David Eltis, areas controlled by the Spanish such as Mexico, Peru, and large parts of Central America used forced slave labor in "mining activities".&lt;ref&gt;Eltis, David. ''Economic Growth and the Ending of the Transatlantic Slave Trade''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1987. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1494 the Pope ushered in the Treaty of Tordesillas, granting Spain and Portugal two separate parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Sider, Sandra. ''Handbook to Life in Renaissance Europe''. New York: Facts On File, 2005. p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this treaty, Portugal had the monopoly on acquiring the slaves from Africa. However, Spain, like Portugal, needed the labor force to pursue their personal economic gains.&lt;ref name="Newson"/&gt;{{rp|20}} This gave Portugal an increased revenue stream. African slaves were sold to the Spanish colonies through an internal reform known as the ''asiento''; which gave the right, by the Spanish Crown, for acquiring African slaves from the Portuguese traders.

In terms of the treatment of slaves, Portuguese external policies on the acquisition of slaves depict a malicious attempt to obtaining economic wealth. Nearly 3,600 slaves a year were traded by a single trader.&lt;ref name="Newson"/&gt;{{rp|68}} This latter statement illuminates that traders tried to get as many slaves as they could in the shortest amount of time. Consequently, this led to the deaths of thousands of African peoples. Newly bought slaves were kept tightly packed in highly flammable huts in order to wait for transport. Once aboard the ships many hundreds of people would once again be shoved into lower ship compartments, collectively chained up, and given little to eat. By these actions "nearly a quarter of the slaves transported died before ever reaching the destination".&lt;ref name="Newson"/&gt;{{rp|72}} Many of them suffocated in the lower compartments as the hatches upon the deck remained closed; restricting the circulation of air. Slaves were often branded with a mark upon their skin to identify either the ship they arrived on or the company that purchased them. In addition, the slaves were seen as a "potentially economic utility"; therefore they were often equated to cattle when moved about.&lt;ref&gt;Postma, Johannes. ''The Dutch in the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1600–1815''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Many African people died in large numbers in order to meet the demand for Spanish and Portuguese labor requirements.

Both Spain and Portugal share a similar history in regards to the treatment of slaves in their colonies. As time progressed and new generations of slaves lived under imperial rule, Spanish and Portuguese internal reforms dealt with African slaves in areas such as, "the purchasing and selling of slaves, legal ownership, succession upon death of owner, the rights of slaves to buy their liberty, and penalties to those who ran away".&lt;ref&gt;Mellafe, Rolando. ''Negro Slavery in Latin America''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1975. p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; There was a constant strict social control amongst the slave population. Nevertheless, the goal was to create and sustain a labor force that would yield maximum economic output. The lucrative business the Portuguese sought on the West African coast ushered in an era in which human labor, at any cost, was used for the extraction of wealth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5360">Gabon is situated at the northwestern margin of the [[Congo Craton]]—a region of stable, ancient crust—and preserves very ancient rock units across 75% of the country, with overlying sedimentary units from the Cretaceous and other more recent periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
The oldest rocks in Gabon are [[granitoid]] [[Archean]] basement rocks, 2.8 to 2.6 billion years old, that span into [[Cameroon]], [[Equatorial Guinea]] and the [[Republic of Congo]]. The basements rocks are divided between the Chaillu Massif and North Gabon Massif. Like many other Archean cratons, the granitoid rocks are associated with potassic rocks, [[granite]], [[monzonite]], [[syenite]] and [[diorite]]-[[tonalite]]-[[granodiorite]] sequences. A large charnockitic body—a series of metamorphic rocks with varying chemical composition—exists in southern Gabon. Unlike other parts of Africa, Gabon lacks [[greenstone belt]] development.

===Proterozoic (2500-541 million years ago)===
The [[Franceville Supergroup]] is made up of two billion year old [[Paleoproterozoic]] rocks, located in the east-central part of the country. The [[Ogooue orogenic belt]] in west-central Gabon also dates to the Paleoproterozoic, made up of heavily deformed [[metasedimentary]] and [[metavolcanic]] rocks from a [[fold and thrust belt]]. In the southwest, the Mayombe-Nyanga terrane contains high-grade Paleoproterozoic basement rocks, the Lambarene [[migmatite]] belt, as well as Doussa Supergroup metasedimentary rocks. Granites appear after the tectonic activity ended and are 1.9 billion years old. 
The [[Mayombe Supergroup]], within the Mayombe-Nyanga terrane, along with Franceville [[dolerite]] dykes from 970 million years ago are the only remnants of the [[Mesoproterozoic]] rocks. The Nyanga Basin and de-la-Noya in the western part of Gabon expose the [[Neoproterozoic]] [[West Congolian Supergroup]], with deformed volcanic and sedimentary sequences, similar to others in southern Africa. A small [[carbonatite]] formation was deposited 669 million years ago in the Lambarene region.

===Cretaceous-Quaternary (145 million years ago to the present)===
A [[Horst (geology)|horst]] from the [[Early Cretaceous]] splits the Lambarene-Chincoua basement rocks and divides the overlying western sedimentary basin in two. The eastern, interior basin is made of a mix of lacustrine and continental sedimentary rocks, while marine sediments are common in the western basin, from the Cretaceous to as recently as the [[Quaternary]]  in the past 2.5 million years. {{sfn|Schluter |2014|p=111-112}}

==Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor==
Gabon has the world's only site known to have self-sustaining natural nuclear fission, at the Oklo reactor zones near the town of [[Franceville]] in the [[Haut-Ogooué]] province. The site was discovered in 1972, during French mining for uranium to supply nuclear reactors. Geologists noticed an unusually low concentration of [[uranium-235]], leading to the current theory that the site was a natural nuclear reactor two billion years ago. Although the original Oklo Mine's resources are now depleted, 17 other sites have been found in the same region that once sustained nuclear fission.

Half of the reactor zones lack carbonaceous material and in these locations, cesium, rubidium, strontium and boron escaped and were lost. However, in others [[uraninite]] is encased in solidified two billion year old [[bitumen]]. Some geologists have suggested that this natural bitumen encasement could be a way of storing human produced nuclear waste in permanent geologic disposal sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Mossman, Gauthier-Lafaye, Dutkiewicz, Bruning |year=2008|title=Carbonaceous substances in Oklo reactors|publisher=Geological Society of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
The petroleum sector is integral to the Gabonese economy. Oil and gas are produced from the western sedimentary basin, which extends into the Atlantic Ocean as far west as [[Sao Tome]]. Hydrocarbons formed in rift basins left over from the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. Many of the oil and gas deposits are contained within salt diapirs, better known as [[salt dome]] features. The Rabi-Kounga oil field, the country's largest, was discovered onshore in 1985, 100 kilometers north of Gamba. It began producing in 1989.
Other oil and gas fields are likely to be discovered as drilling and seismic research continues. Manganese ore is mined in lower Proterozoic deposits near Mounana in southeast Gabon. Uranium deposits were mined out of sandstones in the Franceville Basin until 1999. Diamonds are commonplace in Gabon, mainly extracted in the Makongonio area in the south as well as the Mitzic region in the north. Other resources include iron ore in the Makokou-Mekambo area, barite near Dourekiki and phosphate and niobium at Mabounie. Geologists have identified other deposits such as [[tantalite]], zinc, lead, dolomitic limestone, [[talc]], [[potash]] and a variety of other materials. {{sfn|Schluter |2014|p=112-113}}

Like glaciers on Earth, glaciers on Mars are not pure water ice.&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt; &lt;ref name="ArfstromHartmann" /&gt; Many are thought to contain substantial proportions of debris, and a substantial number are probably better described as [[rock glacier]]s.&lt;ref name="HeadMarchantArsia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colaprete, Anthony, and Bruce M.

Some landscapes look just like glaciers moving out of mountain valleys on Earth.  Some appear to have a hollowed out center, looking like a glacier after almost all the ice has disappeared.

{{Further|Water on Mars#Ice ages}}
It is thought that ice accumulated when Mars' orbital tilt was very different from the present (the axis the planet spins on has considerable "wobble," meaning its angle changes over time).&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine, J. et al. 2007.

(E6).  5062.&lt;/ref&gt;  A few million years ago, the tilt of the axis of Mars was 45 degrees instead of its present 25 degrees.  Its tilt, also called obliquity, varies greatly because its two tiny moons cannot stabilize it like our moon.

Many features on Mars, especially in the Ismenius Lacus quadrangle, are believed to contain large amounts of ice.  The most popular model for the origin of the ice is climate change from large changes in the tilt of the planet's rotational axis.  At times the tilt has even been greater than 80 degrees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Touma | first1 = J. | last2 = Wisdom | first2 = J. | year = 1993 | title = The Chaotic Obliquity of Mars | url = | journal = Science | volume = 259 | issue = | pages = 1294–1297 | doi=10.1126/science.259.5099.1294 | pmid=17732249| bibcode = 1993Sci...259.1294T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laskar | first1 = J. | last2 = Correia | first2 = A. | last3 = Gastineau | first3 = M. | last4 = Joutel | first4 = F. | last5 = Levrard | first5 = B. | last6 = Robutel | first6 = P. | year = 2004 | title = Long term evolution and chaotic diffusion of the insolation quantities of Mars | url = | journal = Icarus | volume = 170 | issue = | pages = 343–364 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2004.04.005 | bibcode=2004Icar..170..343L}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Large changes in the tilt explains many ice-rich features on Mars.

Studies have shown that when the tilt of Mars reaches 45 degrees from its current 25 degrees, ice is no longer stable at the poles.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, J., J. Head, D. Marchant, D. Kowalewski.  2008.

This increased pressure allows more dust to be held in the atmosphere.  Moisture in the atmosphere will fall as snow or as ice frozen onto dust grains.  Calculations suggest this material will concentrate in the mid-latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, J., J. Head, D. Marchant. 2009a.

With the superior resolution of cameras on Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) and MRO, we have found the surface of LDA’s, LVF, and CCFs’ have a complex tangle of ridges that resemble the surface of the human brain.  Wide ridges are called closed-cell [[brain terrain]], and the less common narrow ridges are called open-cell brain terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levy | first1 = J. | last2 = Head | first2 = J. | last3 = Marchant | first3 = D. | year = 2009 | title = Concentric crater fill in Utopia Planitia: History and interaction between glacial ''brain terrain'' and periglacial mantle processes | url = | journal = Icarus | volume = 202 | issue = | pages = 462–476 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2009.02.018 | bibcode=2009Icar..202..462L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that the wide closed-cell terrain still contains a core of ice, that when it eventually disappears the center of the wide ridge collapses to produce the narrow ridges of the open-cell brain terrain.
Today it is widely accepted that glacier-like forms, lobate debris aprons, lineated valley fill, and concentric fill are all related in that they have the same surface texture.  Glacier-like forms in valleys and cirque-like alcoves may coalesce with others to produce lobate debris aprons.  When opposing lobate debris aprons converge, linear valley fill results &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Souness | first1 = C. | last2 = Hubbard | first2 = B. | year = 2013 | title = An alternative interpretation of late Amazonian ice flow:  Protonilus Mensae, Mars | url = | journal = Icarus | volume = 225 | issue = | pages = 495–505 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2013.03.030 | bibcode=2013Icar..225..495S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Ccffigurecaptioned.jpg|This series of drawings illustrates why researchers believe many craters are full of ice-rich material.  The depth of craters can be predicted based upon the observed diameter.  Many craters are almost full, instead of having bowl shape; hence it is believed that they have gained much material since they were formed by impact.  Much of the extra material is probably ice that fell from the sky as snow or ice-coated dust.

Mars has vast glaciers hidden under a layer of rocky debris over wide areas in the mid-latitudes.  These glaciers could be large reservoir of life-supporting water on the planet for simple life forms and for future colonists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_049028_2065&lt;/ref&gt; Research by John Holt, of the University of Texas at Austin, and others found that one of the features examined is three times larger than the city of Los Angeles and up to 800&amp;nbsp;m thick, and there are many more.&lt;ref&gt;.http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article5200977.ec&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27827606/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/buried-glacier-found-mars/&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the glacial-like features were revealed by NASA's Viking orbiters in the 1970s.  Since that time glacial-like features have been studied by more and more advanced instruments.  Much better data has been received from [[Mars Global Surveyor]], [[Mars Odyssey]], [[Mars Express]], and [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]].

{{main|Pula Film Festival}}

The '''Golden Arena for Best Director''' ''([[Croatian language|Croatian]]: Zlatna arena za režiju'') is an award given for best director at the [[Pula Film Festival]], which was until 1992 the [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] equivalent of the [[Academy Awards]]. Since 1992 and the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] the competition narrowed to [[Croatia]]n films only. The first festival was held in 1954, but the award was introduced in 1955.

'''ISO 3166-2:TT''' is the entry for [[Trinidad and Tobago]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Trinidad and Tobago, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[regional corporations and municipalities of Trinidad and Tobago|9 regions, 5 municipalities and one ward]].&lt;!--Eastern Tobago (containing the parishes Saint George, Saint John, Saint Mary, and Saint Paul) and Western Tobago (containing the parishes Saint Andrew, Saint David, and Saint Patrick) are not local government units (as opposed to the regions and municipalities on the island of [[Trinidad]]), as the island of [[Tobago]] is governed locally by the [[Tobago House of Assembly]].--&gt;

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|TT}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Trinidad and Tobago. The second part is three letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

InstantAtlas is a [[data visualization]] and reporting tool used for communicating location-based statistical data held in spreadsheets and desktop [[Geographic Information System]] software.  InstantAtlas is used by analysts, researchers, statisticians and GIS professionals.  It provides tools to load data into pre-built templates, then tailor and brand the outputs, dynamic reports, to meet an almost infinite range of styles and audience capabilities.  The dynamic reports utilise a range of graphical data presentation techniques to present a rich and intuitive picture of the data allowing end-users to discover patterns, trends, relationships and anomilies. The dynamic reports are examples of [[Rich Internet application]]s (RIAs).  They are often described by customers as interactive [[atlases]], area profiles, performance dashboards, and scorecards.

==History==
InstantAtlas was developed by Geowise Ltd, a software company founded in 1997 and based in Edinburgh in the United Kingdom. In 2008 Geowise was acquired by ESRI Holdings Ltd.  It is now managed and run independently as a sister company to ESRI (UK), which is a part of the global [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] network.

==Products==
{{Buzzword|section|date=July 2011}}
'''InstantAtlas Desktop''' is a tool for creating richly interactive dynamic reports, often termed 'atlases', for publication to a wider user audience.  In many cases the dynamic reports are published on web sites to support interactive data exploration and communication.  However they can also be used in standalone mode with no need for web or server connections.  In this form they are ideal for supporting interactive presentations and demonstrations.  The product has four components:
(1) Publisher enables users to load their chosen geographic data and publish it in a dynamic report;
(2) Designer and Style Editor allow users to customise and brand their dynamic reports;
(3) Data Manager is used to store indicator-based data in Microsoft Excel or Access and publish it as an XML data file; and
(4) Templates are pre-built styles of outputs and include Single Map, Double Map, Area Profile, Performance Analysis, and Funnel Plot.
InstantAtlas Desktop is used by government, commercial companies and non-profits across the world for the presentation of geographic patterns and temporal trends in data in areas like public health, poverty and social deprivation, [[geodemographics]], [[crime mapping]], election results, performance reporting, economic monitoring, housing and education.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Place survey report2.jpg|{{deletable image-caption}}]]   --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instantatlas.com/samples/placesurvey/districts/atlas.html Example InstantAtlas dynamic report - Place Survey Results for England]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''InstantAtlas Server''' is a specialist, enterprise-scale web reporting solution for managing and disseminating geographically spread indicator data.  Instead of storing data in files and publishing regular outputs as you would with InstantAtlas Desktop, you manage data in a standard relational database such as [[Microsoft SQL Server]] or [[Oracle Database]].  You can also pull data dynamically from other external information systems.  InstantAtlas Server solutions can be termed [[Local information systems]], Community Information Systems (see [[Community indicators]]), 'Neighborhood Reporting Systems' and 'Area Profiling Tools'.  The product occupies a niche space between more mainstream areas of [[Business Intelligence]] and [[Geographic Information System]]s.  The two primary styles of report output are area profiles and interactive 'data views'.  The product is used for a wide range of international, national, regional and local solutions globally.  The technical and licensing model means it is well suited to federated web-based administration, often by a partnership of organisations, and unlimited levels of end-user access (with content access managed through user logins).
One of the primary drivers for customers is the need to engage better with citizens and empower communities with neighborhood level information through online channels.  For example, Department of Health, New Zealand, uses it to publicly present patterns and trends in a wide range of health conditions across the country while [[Diabetes UK]], a national charity, use it to highlight the differences in local service provision to citizens and to make their own lobbying more effective.

'''Integrating dynamic reports''' - InstantAtlas dynamic reports have been integrated into a number of third party products and solutions (examples include OLAP statistical reporting tools, performance management systems) as an effective method of enhancing data visualization and mapping capabilities.  It is relatively easy to support a data feed based on the InstantAtlas XML schema.

'''Integration with ESRI software''' - InstantAtlas currently integrates with ESRI's [[ArcGIS]] product through a free toolbar add-in.  InstantAtlas Server allows you to pull your geographic data dynamically from ArcGIS Server.

[[File:Lagekarte Dschibal.jpg|thumb|An 1886 map of the 10th-century [[Near East]] showing the province of Jibal]]
'''Jibāl''' ({{lang-ar|جبال}}) was the name given by the [[Arabs]] to a region and province located in western [[Iran]], under the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] [[Caliphates]]. 

Its name means "the Mountains", being the plural of ''jabal'' ("mountain, hill"), highlighting the region's mountainous nature in the [[Zagros]].{{sfn|Lockhart|1965|p=534}}{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|p=185}} Between the 12th and 14th centuries, the name Jibal was progressively abandoned, and it came to be mistakenly referred to as ''ʿIrāq ʿAjamī'' ("[[Persian Iraq]]") to distinguish it from "Arab Iraq" in [[Mesopotamia]].{{sfn|Lockhart|1965|p=534}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1998|p=538}}{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|pp=185–186}} The region never had any precisely defined boundaries, but was held to be bounded by the [[Maranjab Desert]] in the east, by [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Khuzistan]] in the south, by [[Iraq]] in the south-west and west, by [[Adharbayjan]] in the north-west and by the [[Alborz Mountains]] in the north, making it roughly coterminous with the ancient country of [[Media (region)|Media]].{{sfn|Lockhart|1965|p=534}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1998|p=538}} 

Under the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Jibal formed a separate province, with its capital usually at [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]], until the Abbasids lost control in the early 10th century.{{sfn|Bosworth|1998|p=538}} For most of the 9th century, however, the area was ruled by an autonomous local dynasty, the [[Dulafids]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1998|p=538}}{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476–477}} In the late 10th and early 11th century, the larger portion of Jibal became one of the [[Buyid]] emirates, while the south passed to the [[Kakuyids]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1998|p=538}}

The Jibal and [[Azerbaijan]] were considered part of the '''Pahla''' region ('''Fahla''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crone|first=Patricia|authorlink=Patricia Crone|title=The Nativist Prophets of Early Islamic Iran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7k0hAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date= 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-51076-9|page=31|quote= In the period of interest to us, the Pahla region was the Jibal and Azerbaijan (including [[Rayy]] and [[Isfahan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Pahla'' is related to ''[[pahlaviyat]]'' (poems) and ''[[wikt:Pahlavi|Pahlavi]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5097">'''Josef Breu''' (6 January 1914 in [[Trieste]] – 26 April 1998 in [[Vienna]]) was an Austrian [[geographer]] and [[cartographer]] and for several years Chair of the [[United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names]] (UNGEGN).

==Life==
Josef Breu grew up in [[Budapest]] (Hungary), [[Türnitz]] (Austria), [[Niesky]] (Germany) and [[Klosterneuburg]] (Austria), where he passed the high-school leaving exam in 1932. In the same year he started studying geography and history at the [[University of Vienna]]. His dissertation on the history of Croatian settlements in the south eastern border regions of the German-speaking lands was approved in 1937. Breu, who was a polyglot, worked at the Geography Department of the University of Vienna from 1936 to 1938. In 1939 he started teaching at the Abbey’s Secondary School at [[Melk]], but was drafted to the [[Wehrmacht]] in the same year, where he worked for the cartographic service. After World War II Breu worked as a surveyor and private teacher, before he entered the service of the Federal Office for Metrology and Surveying at Vienna ([[Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen]]). From 1959 until 1966 he again taught at a grammar school. Already in 1959 Breu hat started collaborating with the Vienna based Institute for East and Southeast European Studies (Ost- und Südosteuropa-Institut). From 1966 until 1979, the year of his retirement, he was the head of the geographic department of that institution. After his [[habilitation]] in 1974 Breu became a [[docent]] at the Geography Department of the University of Vienna. In 1982 he became a corresponding member of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]].

==Fields of activities and works==
Within the Institute for East and Southeast European Studies Breus main field of activity was the ''Atlas of the Danubian Countries''.&lt;ref&gt;Breu, Josef (ed.): Atlas der Donauländer / Atlas of the Danubian countries / Atlas des pays danubiens / Atlas dunajskih stran. 11 fascicles. Wien 1970-1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Josef Breu was also very active in the sphere of toponomastics, especially in the standardization of geographical names. In 1969 he initiated the foundation of the Austrian Board on Geographical Names (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Kartographische Ortsnamenkunde), that functions as a clearinghouse of the main Austrian federal and provincial authorities and institutions of science and research as well as of private publishers concerned with geographical names. Breu held the chair of this board until 1982. In 1975 he published his ''Gazetteer of Austria'',&lt;ref&gt;Breu, Josef: Gazetteer of Austria, edited in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations / Geographisches Namenbuch Österreichs, bearbeitet nach den Empfehlungen der Vereinten Nationen. Vienna/Wien, Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften 1975. {{ISBN|3-7001-0114-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; edited in accordance with the recommendations of the [[United Nations]]. This dictionary of geographical proper names of Austria, one of his main works, covers rivers, lakes, glaciers, mountains, passes, mountain ranges, populated places, roads, railways, waterways, etc. It gives a broad range of data with every name, such as correct spelling, pronunciation, indication of the respective topographic category, location, geographical coordinates, elevation above sea level, name of the administrative unit in which the name feature is situated, variant forms (if any) and grammatical references. From 1976 until 1982 Breu held the chair of the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (Ständiger Ausschuss für Geographische Namen), a board which promotes and coordinates the standardization of toponyms in the German-speaking countries. In 1977 Josef Breu was elected Chair of the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN), where he had already been active for several years before. The [[UNGEGN Toponymic Guidelines]] were established on his initiative.

== Life ==
Yesi was born in [[Xinhui District]] in [[Guangdong]] during 1949. The same year, his family settled in Hong Kong, and he was raised there. His father died when he was four.

He began writing in the 1960s and quickly became known as a translator of foreign-language literature and for his editorial work on a number of literary publications targeted at young Chinese readers in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiancha.com/content/view/1434/400/|title=Cha: An Asian Literary Journal - Leung Ping-kwan|website=Asiancha.com|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[Hong Kong Baptist College]] (Now: Hong Kong Baptist University) with a bachelor's degree in English (BA in English Language and Literature), Yesi got a job first as a secondary school teacher, then as the editor of the [[South China Morning Post]] (SCMP). In 1978, he went to America for further studies. In 1984, Yesi got his PhD degree in comparative literature at the University of California, San Diego. His PhD thesis was "Aesthetics of opposition: a study of the modernist generation of Chinese poets, 1936-1949".

Yesi returned to Hong Kong after earning his doctorate. He taught at the Department of English Studies and Comparative Literature at the [[University of Hong Kong]]. In 1998 he got a position as a professor giving lectures on comparative literature in the Chinese Department at [[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan University]]. Later on, he also became director of the Research Institute for the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/rih/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He specialized in teaching literature and film, comparative literature, the literature of Hong Kong, modern literary criticism, and Chinese literary writing.

Yesi had achievements across many areas of literature, including poetry, prose, novels, drama, and literary and cultural criticism. He wrote mostly in Chinese. However, his English works were also published in the Hong Kong magazine ''[[Muse (Hong Kong magazine)|Muse]]'' and his poetry and prose have been translated into English, French, Korean, Japanese, Arabic, Portuguese, and German.

In 2010, Yesi stated publicly that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer. He died on 5 January 2013.

== "Yesi" ==
"Yesi" is a combination of two meaningless words, both interjections, in Chinese. According to Yesi, people usually adopt a pen name that contains meanings, which would give the readers a fixed feeling or impression towards their works before they read them. Yesi wanted to break out of this, hence, he used the combination of two meaningless words, which usually appear in classical Chinese literary works, as his pen name.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Prominent themes and concerns of Yesi's works ==

''&lt;u&gt;Images of Hong Kong&lt;/u&gt;''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = City at the End of Time 形象香港: Poems by Leung Ping-kwan 梁秉鈞詩選|last = Leung|first = Ping-kwan|publisher = Hong Kong University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9789888139354|location = Hong Kong|pages = 79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This poem embodies the spirit and concerns of Yesi's work, including tone and recurrent themes. Later, this poem would be used as an example for further analysis of Yesi's style.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We need a fresh angle, nothing added nothing taken away,&lt;br/&gt;
Always at the edge of things and between places.&lt;br/&gt;
Write with a different color for each voice;&lt;br/&gt;
…&lt;br/&gt;
So now, once again, they say it’s time to remodel&lt;br/&gt;
and each of us finds himself looking around for –what?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Observation, perception, and angle ===
Many of Yesi's works are concerned with the way we look at the world, and also how we are perceived by other people—trying to discover new angles for observing the world, while inevitably the object of others’ perception as well. The opening sentence of “Images of Hong Kong” clearly declares: “I need a new angle”. In many of Yesi's works, the narrator wants not only to see the world, but also to look at it in a unique way, different from mainstream perceptions.

However, Yesi's narrators are introspective and aware that they are part of what's happening. The novel ''Paper Cut-outs'' (剪紙) is composed of two story lines, each about the narrator's interaction with a female friend. The two story lines can be read as separate stories, yet, they contrast and complement each other in details and contents. Both his friends faced a catastrophe nearly at the end of the story, and the narrator says: &lt;blockquote&gt;人與人之間的關係互相牽連，混合了我們這些其他人的感情。我們這些旁觀者一下子也牽涉其中了，我們可以指責某種偏激行為…但當不幸的事發生了，我們可以置身事外嗎?” (161)

(Translation: A relationship would be affected by other relationships. Observers’ feelings are mixed into the relationship of the observed. Outsiders and observers are also part of what he or she is observing. We can blame certain violent acts… However, when tragedy happens, who can be responsibility-free?)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The narrator feels sorry for what happened to his friends, and for not being able to do anything, except narrate and watch the problem grow, and turn into a catastrophe.

=== Flânerie ===
Observation in Yesi's poems almost always associated with ''flânerie''. More precisely, the narrator is very often a ''[[flâneur]]''. Yesi writes about different places and even ''flânerie'' itself. ''Images of Hong Kong'' includes many different locations: Guangguang studio in [[Nathan Road]], [[Star Ferry Pier, Central#Third Generation|Star Ferry clock tower]], [[Aberdeen, Hong Kong|Aberdeen]], [[China Club]], and so on. In the poem ''On a Road, A Wanderer'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I choose my own direction&lt;br/&gt;
big fish glide in the aquariums&lt;br/&gt;
food stalls offer whopper fishballs&lt;br/&gt;
I'm not lured&lt;br/&gt;
…&lt;br/&gt;
I don’t have to see so clearly&lt;br/&gt;
…&lt;br/&gt;
if by chance the city glare&lt;br/&gt;
blinds me&lt;br/&gt;
I glance away,&lt;br/&gt;
keeping my own pace&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The above describes how the narrator strolling unaffected by the surroundings. He observes and sees “big fish glide”, “food stalls”, and so on, yet uses the outer appearance of the city, to search his heart. It is notable that he “[doesn’t] have to see so clearly. Again, the narrator keeps himself different from others.

=== Nolstagia and history ===
There is very often a sense of pity for the disappearing past in Yesi’s works. For example, in ''Images of Hong Kong'', the people do not paint on photos “any more”, and the “old portrait” cannot be reproduced. Like this portrait, in many of Yesi's works, we can see things that are disappearing with the past. Also, the narrator says that history is a “montage of images”, and evaluates if Hong Kong's past is only figures of famous buildings like the Star Ferry. He suggests that the past should be read with “a fresh angle" and reviews the way to looking into the past.

=== Hong Kong ===
Yesi is recognized as a Hong Kong poet, not only because he grew up in the city, but more importantly due to his concern for it. ''Images of Hong Kong'' show such concern, as the narrator wants to find a new angle to shoot Hong Kong. Moveover, Some of Yesi's other poems are about places in Hong Kong, such as ''Winter Scene from [[Tai Mei Tuk]]'', ''Reclaimed Land in [[Tai Kok Tsui]]'', and ''Midway, [[Quarry Bay]]''. Apart from the sense of place, Hong Kong serves as an important context for Yesi's novels. Again, take ''Paper Cut-outs'' as an example; the narrator's two female friends actually symbolize Hong Kong people's identity. This is also how Chinese culture and Western culture failed to understand or merge with one other in Hong Kong. For example, Qiáo (喬), a modern women, is a character showing that Hong Kong people do not understand their Chinese origin very well, but on the other hand, are not completely westernized. She cannot understand or grasp the feelings in traditional Chinese poems. Moreover, her face is so pale that it would reflect the color of her surroundings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;外面廣告牌上的一大幅粉藍色填滿所有窗口，喬的臉孔染上一片粉藍。…經過一片淺黃，她的臉又泛上淺黃。

(Translation:The billboard outside the bus filled the latter’s windows with light blue, so as Qiáo’s face…When the bus passes through a sea of light yellow, her face also reflects in yellow.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This symbolizes the cultural identity of Hong Kong, actually quite fragile. Without rooting in Chinese or Western culture, Hong Kong does not have, or has not created, any distinct culture. They are easily affected by others, and reflect others’ colors.

Even in the most seemingly unlikely sphere to be associated with Hong Kong, Yesi shows his concern for the city. For him, travelling has a lot to do with home. The book ''Leung Ping Kwan (1949 – 2013), A Retrospective'' (回看.也斯), says that “[e]very foreign place he visited invoked in him even deeper thoughts about Hong Kong. He wrote copiously about his cross-border experiences, in prose and in poetry, from eastern culture to western culture, from literature and art to cultural observations, from old ideas to new concepts, posing questions that would not have been formulated if he had not left Hong Kong, and trying to portray, to a Hong Kong wallowing in old habits, new sets of emotion and knowledge in hope of a change.”{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In short, Yesi's works are deeply concerned with Hong Kong, no matter what the topic or context.

== Characteristics of Yesi's works ==

=== Personification of places and objects ===
Yesi often personified places and objects in his poems. Some of these poems include ''Central'', ''Europe After Rain'', and ''Bittermelon''. Yesi would talk gently to the personified objects, as if they were his friends. In ''Europe After Rain'', the narrator walks into a church, and talks to the place:

“I shiver in the cold. You don't seem to have heard my prayer. Your four walls are mottled, the ancient stories have turned into reliefs, in the flickering light and shadow your magnificent and inevitabilities of history.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Very often, there are interactions of “I” and “you” in Yesi's works, but the latter is sometimes an object or a place.

=== Voice, tone, and narrative ===
There is a sort of double voicing in Yesi's poems, multiple layers of meaning. In the poem ''Bittermelon'':&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = City at the End of Time 形象香港: Poems by Leung Ping-kwan 梁秉鈞詩選|last = Leung|first = Ping-kwan|publisher = [[Hong Kong University Press]]|year = 2012|isbn = 9789888139354|location = Hong Kong|pages = 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; he says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You're not worn-out or beaten-down,&lt;br/&gt;
you're just resting.&lt;br/&gt;
The loudest song's not necessarily passionate;&lt;br/&gt;
the bitterest pain stays in the heart.&lt;br/&gt;
Is it because you've seen lots of false sunlight,&lt;br/&gt;
too much thunder and lightning, hurt and hurting...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The narrator not only converses with objects and places but also to the reader. He asks “[i]s it because you've seen lots of false sunlight…too many indifferent and temperamental days” that you have stopped talking about your sufferings? The questions give us a feeling that the narrator sympathizes with us, the readers, and gently inquires as to our situations. Instead of readers reading the poem, the poem seems to read us as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Literature, Criticism and Theory|last = Bennett|first = Andrew|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = 9781317864318|location = |pages = |last2 = Royle|first2 = Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Your silence is much to be admired;&lt;br/&gt;
you keep the bitter taste to yourself.&lt;br/&gt;
...&lt;br/&gt;
in the wind, our bittermelon, steadily facing&lt;br/&gt;
worlds of confused worlds of confused bees and butterflies and a garden gone wild
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The narrator seems to be talking to himself and also to the author. Yesi's narrators often try to position and view themselves in a way different from the mainstream. Above “our bittermelon” is described as “steadily facing worlds of confused bees and butterflies and a garden gone wild”. This seems to describe the narrator, or perhaps Yesi himself, trying to walk in “[his] own pace” (''Images of Hong Kong'') without being distracted by the world, or by mainstream values. Some of Yesi's first and second person narrators do interchange with each other. In ''Paper Cut-outs'', when the narrator refers to his friend Yáo (瑤), he always uses second person narrative “you”. The book's narrative sometimes changes, and the narrator refers to readers, characters, and himself with the plural pronoun “we”. Similarly, in the above poem, in the end the bittermelon becomes “ours” at last.

== Influences on Yesi's works ==

=== Latin-American magical realism ===
Yesi “was the first to bring in Latin American literary icons such as [[Gabriel García Márquez|Gabriel Garcìa Márquez]], [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] before they were widely known”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His works are also heavily influenced by [[magic realism|magical realism]]. Many critics have noted how Yesi used magical elements to interpret reality in his novels. For example, a critic analyzed [[magic realism]] in Yesi's novel “Shih-man the Dragon-keeper” (《養龍人師門》).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 也斯作品評論集: 小說部份|last = 陳素怡|first = |publisher = 香港文學評論出版社有限公司|year = 2011|isbn = 9789881511416|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example: the description of Qiáo's room in ''Paper Cut-outs'' demonstrates features of magic realism. The narrator visits Qiáo, who is a psychotic. In her room, “many red birds are drawn on the white walls, approximately thirty” (白色牆壁上畫滿紅色鳥兒，一共有好幾十隻。).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 剪紙|first = |last= 也斯|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780195938401|location = |pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She “walks close to the walls, between the red birds” (她走近牆邊，走入那些紅色的鳥兒中間。) The “birds listen to and obey her!” (鳥兒是聽話的！).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 剪紙|first = |last = 也斯|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780195938401|location = |pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Each of her birds have names. Good Bò Bò. Fā Fā was naughty yesterday, and Wá Wá hasn’t eaten for a few days” (她的鳥兒都有名字。柏柏乖，發發昨天淘氣，娃娃幾天不吃東西了。).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 剪紙|first = |last = 也斯|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780195938401|location = |pages = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The birds fly in the room. “She touches the wings of one of the birds” (喬撫著一頭鳥的翅膀), and a bird “stops on [the narrator’s] fingertip” (停在我的指尖).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 剪紙|first = |last = 也斯|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780195938401|location = |pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the birds are painted on the walls, Qiáo regarded them as alive. Imagination becomes reality in this passage.

=== Modernism ===
[[Modernism]] seeks to write novels in a way that reflects a human being's inner thoughts, which are often fragmented. Yesi's novels also write about different moments in life that are perhaps not consistent. In the novel ''Paper Cut-outs'', linkage between the two seemingly separate story lines is imagined and drawn by readers. There is no clear message imposed by the author. Paper cut-outs are like fragmented moments, words, and phrases, which are all broken into parts. The connections between the fragments are vague; ambiguity is an important feature of modernism.

=== Chinese literature ===
Chinese literature also heavily influences Yesi's work. Elements of Chinese culture, like folk and opera, can be seen in his works. Elements of [[Cantonese opera]] can be seen in his work ''Paper Cut-outs''. Also, he inherited some of the traditional Chinese forms of writing. For example, his ''Bittermelon'' poem praises this plant, which symbolizes virtues stressed in Chinese culture – patience and endurance. The narrator credits bittermelon for its “silence”, saying it "keep[s] the bitter taste to [itself]”.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; This means being willing and able to endure suffering and not making others feel pity. The poem echoes the Chinese literary tradition of praising an object that symbolizes virtue and good people.

=== Other art media ===
Yesi was not satisfied with just language. Other art media were also sources of inspiration; for example performance art, photography, and film. He “entered into countless dialogues with artists of different media”,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and even collaborated with them to write literary works. For example, dancer Mui Cheuk Yin performed the dance “Kikikoko”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkmemory.hk/collections/Yasi/all_items/images/201607/t20160705_79570.html |title=Mui Cheuk Yin's dance performance: Kikikoko |website=Hong Kong Memory| publisher=Leisure and Cultural Services Department; Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Yesi wrote a poem inspired by her performance – ''Ladder Street''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Yesi's work is also influenced by his interest in film. He often writes as if he is shooting a scene with his camera. For example, the narrator keeps looking for an angle in ''Images of Hong Kong'' and in another poem, ''City of Films''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is introspective in evaluating the best way to capture Hong Kong like a movie shooting: &lt;blockquote&gt;...then in the second half, find you're your enemy's son&lt;br/&gt;life goes on without knowing what’s happened&lt;br/&gt;if reality's too hard, there’s always soft focus&lt;br/&gt;the world's still out there, the PR guy’s at the door&lt;br/&gt;with new schemes for artful promotion&lt;br/&gt;and for the film a new title&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Achievements ==
Yesi was recognized as both a writer and a scholar, received various literary awards, and was invited as visiting scholar to universities across the globe. The German professor [[Wolfgang Kubin]] commented that Yesi was “a rare Hong Kong writer with a global vision”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Mount Logan.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Mount Logan]] in the [[Saint Elias Mountains]] of [[Yukon]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[summit]] of Canada.]]

This article comprises four sortable tables of [[Summit|mountain summits]] of Canada that are the [[Elevation|higher]] than any other point [[#Northernmost high summits|north]] or [[#Southernmost high summits|south]] of their [[latitude]] or [[#Easternmost high summits|east]] or [[#Westernmost high summits|west]] their [[longitude]] in Canada.

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in Nicaragua, {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2241">[[File:UK traffic sign 7009.svg|thumb|[[United Kingdom|UK]] loose chippings sign. In other [[Europe]]an countries, the signs are similar.]]
'''Loose chippings''' are loose gravel or stone fragments on a [[road surface]] and form a [[hazard]] to [[vehicle]]s using that road. It may come from the road's [[chip seal]]. Causes include:
* Unbound surplus [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] not removed from the surface when the road is resurfaced.
* [http://pavementinteractive.org/index.php?title=Raveling Raveling] of a chip seal or [[asphalt concrete]] pavement. This is usually the result of a poor bond between the asphalt and the aggregate. As a result, the aggregate breaks free from the road surface.
* Raveling caused by mechanical wear from [[snowplow]]s or studded [[snow tire]]s. 
* Gravel deposited on the road by erosion of [[Cut (earthmoving)|cut sections]] above the road.
* Gravel carried onto the road by tyres of a vehicle that was driven onto a gravel shoulder, or entered a paved road from a [[gravel road]].

Excessive speed while driving through loose chippings damage both the road and vehicles. Loose chippings can reduce traction and cause loss of control. This is a special hazard to motorcyclists and bicyclists, who may lose their balance and fall if their tires start sliding. Loose chippings can be picked up by [[Tire|tyres]] and damage them, or may be spun off to become high speed missiles, which may injure or damage other persons or vehicles on the road.

Loose chippings may accumulate on verges, where they may choke drainage channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krA3AAAAMAAJ|page=20|title=Practical road construction|year=1957|author=Joseph H. Arnison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, [[road sign]]s are put up, requiring vehicles to drive at a low speed. In the UK, these temporary traffic signs will require the driver to proceed at 20 mph.

==Other uses==

Some English placenames contain "Chipping", from an old word for "market". As a result, "Loose Chippings" is sometimes used humorously as a [[fictional place]] name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/#q=%22village+of+loose+chippings%22 Google search]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIKE 21C''' is a [[computer program]] that simulates the development in the [[river bed]] and [[Channel (geography)|channel]] plan form in two dimensions. MIKE 21C was developed by [[DHI (company)|DHI]]. MIKE 21C uses curvilinear finite difference grids.

Simulated processes with MIKE 21C include [[bank erosion]], scouring and shoaling brought about by activities such as construction and dredging, seasonal fluctuations in flow, etc.

==Applications==
MIKE 21C can be used for designing protection schemes against bank erosion, evaluating measures to reduce or manage shoaling, analyzing alignments and dimensions of navigation channels for minimizing capital and maintenance dredging, predicting the impact of bridge, tunnel and pipeline crossings on river channel hydraulics and morphology, optimizing restoration plans for habitat environment in channel floodplain systems, designing monitoring networks based on morphological forecasting.

Due to its accurate descriptions of the physical processes, MIKE 21C can simulate a [[braided river]] developing from a plane bed, which was illustrated by Enggrob &amp; Tjerry (1998).

==Theory==
As most other models made by DHI, MIKE 21C applies an add-on concept in which the overall time-loop can contain processes to be simulated, selected by the user. In its basic form the model is a 2-dimensional hydrodynamic model that can simulate dynamic as well as quasi-steady or steady-state hydrodynamic solutions. The [[hydrodynamic]] model solves the Saint-Venant equations in two dimensions with the water depth defined in cell centers and a staggered velocity field (internally the code solves the flux field, i.e. the water depth multiplied by the velocity vector) defined with direction as the local grid base vector.

The model is computationally a parallel code (written in [[Fortran]]) with parallelizations in all modules, which allows for simulations of morphological developments on fine grids over long periods of time. The model is typically applied with as much 25,000 computational points over periods of several years or even decades.

The most important secondary flow in rivers is the so-called helical flow, with its name derived from Helios (the Sun in Greek). The name helical is used because the flow arises as the water in the lower portions of the water column flowing towards the local center of curvature, and away from the local center of curvature along the water surface. This has only a minor impact on the hydrodynamics, usually only pronounced on a laboratory scale, but it has profound impacts on the sediment transport and morphology because the helical flow influences the otherwise zero transverse sediment component. MIKE 21C applies standard theory for the helical flow, which can be found in e.g. Rozowsky (1957). Standard helical flow theory provides a secondary flow velocity profile that is fully characterised by friction and the deviation angle between the main flow direction and the direction of the shear stress at the river bed.

MIKE 21C uses the traditional division of [[sediment]] transport into [[bedload]] and suspended load, and the model can simulate both non-cohesive and cohesive sediment in a mixture.

The bed-load model accounts for the impacts of secondary flow (bed shear stress direction) and local bed slope (gravity). Suspended load is calculated with an advection-dispersion equation for each fraction, which includes adaptation in time and space as well as the 2-dimensional depth-integrated effects of the 3-dimensional flow pattern through profile functions (Galappatti &amp; Vreugdenhil, 1985).

{{Weather}}
{{Atmospheric sciences}}

'''Meteorology''' is a branch of the [[atmospheric sciences]] which includes [[atmospheric chemistry]] and [[atmospheric physics]], with a major focus on [[weather forecasting]].  The study of meteorology dates back [[millennia]], though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 18th century. The 19th century saw modest progress in the field after [[weather observation]] networks were formed across broad regions. Prior attempts at [[Weather prediction|prediction of weather]] depended on historical data. It was not until after the elucidation of the [[laws of physics]] and, more particularly, the development of the computer, allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather, in the latter half of the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved.

[[List of meteorological phenomena|Meteorological phenomena]] are observable weather events that are explained by the science of meteorology. Meteorological phenomena are described and quantified by the variables of [[Earth's atmosphere]]: [[temperature]], [[air pressure]], [[water vapour]], [[mass flow]], and the variations and interactions of those variables, and how they change over time. Different [[Scale (spatial)|spatial scales]] are used  to describe and predict weather on local, regional, and global levels.
 
Meteorology, [[climatology]], [[atmospheric physics]], and [[atmospheric chemistry]] are sub-disciplines of the [[atmospheric sciences]]. Meteorology and [[hydrology]] compose the interdisciplinary field of [[hydrometeorology]]. The interactions between Earth's atmosphere and its oceans are part of a coupled ocean-atmosphere system. Meteorology has application in many diverse fields such as the military, [[energy production]], transport, [[agriculture]], and [[construction]].

The word ''[[wikt:meteorology|meteorology]]'' is from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:μετέωρος|μετέωρος]] ''metéōros'' (''meteor'') and [[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]] ''-logia'' (''[[wikt:-logy|-(o)logy]]''), meaning "the study of things high in the air".

==History==
{{Main article|Timeline of meteorology}}
[[File:AlpineRainbow.jpg|thumb|left|[[Parhelion|Parhelion (sundog)]] in [[Savoie]]]]

The ability to predict rains and floods based on annual cycles was evidently used by humans at least from the time of agricultural settlement if not earlier. Early approaches to predicting weather were based on [[astrology]] and were practiced by priests. [[Cuneiform]] inscriptions on [[Babylon]]ian tablets included associations between thunder and rain. The [[Babylon|Chaldean]]s differentiated the [[22° halo|22°]] and [[46° halo]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hellmann|first=G.|date=1908-10-01|title=The dawn of meteorology|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.49703414802/abstract|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|language=en|volume=34|issue=148|pages=221–232|doi=10.1002/qj.49703414802|issn=1477-870X|bibcode=1908QJRMS..34..221H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:If the flashing body is set on fire and rushes violently to the Earth it is called a thunderbolt; if it is only half of fire, but violent also and massive, it is called a ''meteor''; if it is entirely free from fire, it is called a smoking bolt. They are all called 'swooping bolts' because they swoop down upon the Earth. Lightning is sometimes smoky, and is then called 'smoldering lightning"; sometimes it darts quickly along, and is then said to be ''vivid''. At other times, it travels in crooked lines, and is called ''forked lightning''. When it swoops down upon some object it is called 'swooping lightning'.

The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] scientist [[Theophrastus]] compiled a book on weather forecasting, called the ''Book of Signs''.

In 1824, [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] analyzed the efficiency of [[steam engine]]s using caloric theory; he developed the notion of a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]] and, in postulating that no such thing exists in nature, laid the foundation for the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

In the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century a range of meteorological instruments was invented – the [[thermometer]], [[barometer]], [[hydrometer]], as well as wind and rain gauges. In the 1650s natural philosophers started using these instruments to systematically record weather observations. Scientific academies established weather diaries and organised observational networks.&lt;ref name="ModScience"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2003|author=John L. Heilbron|isbn=9780199743766|pages=518}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1654, [[Ferdinando II de Medici]] established the first ''weather observing'' network, that consisted of meteorological stations in [[Florence]], [[Cutigliano]], [[Vallombrosa]], [[Bologna]], [[Parma]], [[Milan]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Osnabrück]], Paris and [[Warsaw]]. The collected data were sent to Florence at regular time intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond S. Bradley, Philip D. Jones, ''Climate Since A.D. 1500'', Routledge, 1992, {{ISBN|0-415-07593-9}}, p.144&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1660s [[Robert Hooke]] of the [[Royal Society of London]] sponsored networks of weather observers. [[Hippocrates]]' treatise ''Airs, Waters, and Places'' had linked weather to disease. Thus early meteorologists attempted to correlate weather patterns with epidemic outbreaks, and the climate with public health.&lt;ref name="ModScience" /&gt; 

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]] meteorology tried to rationalise traditional weather lore, including astrological meteorology. But there were also attempts to establish a theoretical understanding of weather phenomena. [[Edmond Halley]] and [[George Hadley]] tried to explain [[trade winds]]. They reasoned that the rising mass of heated equator air is replaced by an inflow of cooler air from high latitudes. A flow of warm air at high altitude from equator to poles in turn established an early picture of circulation. Frustration with the lack of discipline among weather observers, and the poor quality of the instruments, led the early modern [[nation states]] to organise large observation networks. Thus by the end of the 18th century meteorologists had access to large quantities of reliable weather date.&lt;ref name="ModScience" /&gt; In 1832, an electromagnetic telegraph was created by [[Baron Schilling]].&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Martin (2009) [http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?/catapult/indepth/telegraph.htm Catapult - Indepth - Communication: telegraph], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], Retrieved on 2009-05-12&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of the [[electrical telegraph]] in 1837 afforded, for the first time, a practical method for quickly gathering [[surface weather observation]]s from a wide area.&lt;ref&gt;[[Library of Congress]], [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/sfbmhtml/sfbmtelessay.html The Invention of the Telegraph], Retrieved on 2009-01-01&lt;/ref&gt;

This data could be used to produce maps of the state of the atmosphere for a region near the Earth's surface and to study how these states evolved through time. To make frequent weather forecasts based on these data required a reliable network of observations, but it was not until 1849 that the [[Smithsonian Institution]] began to establish an observation network across the United States under the leadership of [[Joseph Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.si.edu/archives/ihd/jhp/joseph03.htm |title=Smithsonian Institution Archives |work=Smithsonian Institution Archives |accessdate=16 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020020548/http://www.si.edu/archives/ihd/jhp/joseph03.htm |archivedate=20 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar observation networks were established in Europe at this time.

[[File:IBM 7090 console used by a meteorologist, 1965.jpg|thumb|A meteorologist at the console of the IBM 7090 in the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit. c. 1965]]

In 1904, Norwegian scientist [[Vilhelm Bjerknes]] first argued in his paper ''Weather Forecasting as a Problem in Mechanics and Physics'' that it should be possible to forecast weather from calculations based upon [[physical law|natural laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Berknes, V. (1904) "Das Problem der Wettervorhersage, betrachtet vom Standpunkte der Mechanik und der Physik" (The problem of weather prediction, considered from the viewpoints of mechanics and physics), ''Meteorologische Zeitschrift'', '''21''' : 1–7.

It was not until later in the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern [[numerical weather prediction]]. In 1922, [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] published "Weather Prediction By Numerical Process",&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Lewis Fry, ''Weather Prediction by Numerical Process'' (Cambridge, England:  Cambridge University Press, 1922).  Available on-line at:  [https://archive.org/stream/weatherpredictio00richrich#page/n7/mode/2up Internet Archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt; after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I. He described how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations that govern atmospheric flow could be neglected, and a numerical calculation scheme that could be devised to allow predictions. Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to complete without electronic computers, and the size of the grid and time steps used in the calculations led to unrealistic results. Though numerical analysis later found that this was due to [[numerical instability]].

Starting in the 1950s, [[number|numerical]] forecasts with computers became feasible.&lt;ref&gt;American Institute of Physics. [http://www.aip.org/history/sloan/gcm/ Atmospheric General Circulation Modeling.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325084036/http://www.aip.org/history/sloan/gcm/ |date=2008-03-25 }} Retrieved on 2008-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[weather forecast]]s derived this way used [[barotropic]] (single-vertical-level) models, and could successfully predict the large-scale movement of midlatitude [[Rossby wave]]s, that is, the pattern of [[low pressure area|atmospheric lows]] and [[high pressure area|highs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Storm Watchers |page=208 |year=2002 |author=Cox, John D. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=0-471-38108-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the UK Meteorological Office received its first computer, a [[Ferranti Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/history-of-numerical-weather-prediction|title=The history of Numerical Weather Prediction at the Met Office|last=|first=|date=|website=Met Office|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] nature of the atmosphere was first observed and mathematically described by [[Edward Lorenz]], founding the field of [[chaos theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Lorenz, "Deterministic non-periodic flow", ''Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences'', vol.&amp;nbsp;20, pages 130–141 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; These advances have led to the current use of [[ensemble forecasting]] in most major forecasting centers, to take into account uncertainty arising from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="HPCens"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/ensembletraining |author=Manousos, Peter |publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]] |date=2006-07-19 |accessdate=2010-12-31 |title=Ensemble Prediction Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical models used to predict the long term weather of the Earth ([[climate model]]s), have been developed that have a resolution today that are as coarse as the older weather prediction models. These climate models are used to investigate long-term [[climate]] shifts, such as what effects might be caused by human emission of [[greenhouse gas]]es.

==Meteorologists==
{{further|Weather forecasting}}

'''Meteorologists''' are scientists who study meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Todd S.|last1=Glickman|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=June 2009|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Meteorologist |title=Meteorology Glossary|format=electronic|edition=2nd|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Meteorological Society published and continually updates an authoritative electronic ''Meteorology Glossary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Todd S.|last1=Glickman|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=June 2000|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/?p=1&amp;query=doldrums|title=Meteorology Glossary|format=electronic|edition=2nd|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meteorologists work in [[Government agency|government agencies]], private consulting and [[research]] services, industrial enterprises, utilities, radio and [[television stations]], and in [[education]]. In the United States, meteorologists held about 9,400 jobs in 2009.&lt;ref name="BLS"&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos051.htm Bureau of labor statistics: "Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meteorologists are best known by the public for [[weather forecasting]]. Some radio and television weather forecasters are professional meteorologists, while others are [[reporters]] (weather specialist, weatherman, etc.) with no formal meteorological training. The [[American Meteorological Society]] and [[National Weather Association]] issue "Seals of Approval" to weather broadcasters who meet certain requirements.

==Equipment==
[[File:Huracán Hugo.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of [[Hurricane Hugo]] with a [[polar low]] visible at the top of the image]]
{{Main article|Meteorological instrumentation}}
Each science has its own unique sets of laboratory equipment. In the atmosphere, there are many things or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured. Rain, which can be observed, or seen anywhere and anytime was one of the first atmospheric qualities measured historically. Also, two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity. Neither of these can be seen but can be felt. The devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th century and were respectively the [[rain gauge]], the anemometer, and the hygrometer. Many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables. Many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable. Even [[Aristotle]] noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air.

Sets of surface measurements are important data to meteorologists. They give a snapshot of a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a [[weather station]], a ship or a [[weather buoy]]. The measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables. Usually, temperature, [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]], wind measurements, and [[humidity]] are the variables that are measured by a thermometer, barometer, anemometer, and hygrometer, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Federal Coordinator of Meteorology. [http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1 - Surface Weather Observations and Reports: September 2005.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990420051036/http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm |date=1999-04-20 }} Retrieved on 2009-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional stations may also include air quality sensors ([[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], [[ozone]], [[dust]], and [[smoke]]), [[ceilometer]] (cloud ceiling), falling precipitation sensor,  [[level sensor|flood sensor]], [[lightning|lightning sensor]], [[microphone]] ([[explosion]]s, [[sonic boom]]s, [[thunder]]), [[pyranometer]]/[[pyrheliometer]]/[[spectroradiometer]] (IR/Vis/UV [[photodiodes]]), [[rain gauge]]/[[snow gauge]], [[scintillation counter]] ([[background radiation]], [[fallout]], [[radon]]), [[seismometer]] ([[earthquake]]s and tremors), [[transmissometer]] (visibility), and a [[GPS clock]] for [[data logging]]. Upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting. The most widely used technique is launches of [[radiosonde]]s. Supplementing the radiosondes a [[Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay|network of aircraft collection]] is organized by the [[World Meteorological Organization]].

[[Remote sensing]], as used in meteorology, is the concept of collecting data from remote weather events and subsequently producing weather information. The common types of remote sensing are [[Radar]], [[Lidar]], and [[satellites]] (or [[photogrammetry]]). Each collects data about the atmosphere from a remote location and, usually, stores the data where the instrument is located. Radar and Lidar are not passive because both use [[EM radiation]] to illuminate a specific portion of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Peebles, Peyton, [1998], ''Radar Principles'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, {{ISBN|0-471-25205-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Weather satellites along with more general-purpose Earth-observing satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to [[El Niño]].

==Spatial scales==
The study of the atmosphere can be divided into distinct areas that depend on both time and spatial scales. At one extreme of this scale is climatology. In the timescales of hours to days, meteorology separates into micro-, meso-, and synoptic scale meteorology. Respectively, the [[geospatial]] size of each of these three scales relates directly with the appropriate timescale.

Other subclassifications are used to describe the unique, local, or broad effects within those subclasses.

===Microscale===
{{Main article|Microscale meteorology}}

Microscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena on a scale of about {{convert|1|km|mi}} or less. Individual thunderstorms, clouds, and local turbulence caused by buildings and other obstacles (such as individual hills) are modeled on this scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?query=micrometeorology |title=AMS Glossary of Meteorology |accessdate=2008-04-12 |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606101802/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?query=micrometeorology |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesoscale===
{{Main article|Mesoscale meteorology}}

Mesoscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena that has horizontal scales ranging from 1&amp;nbsp;km to 1000&amp;nbsp;km and a vertical scale that starts at the Earth's surface and includes the atmospheric boundary layer, troposphere, [[tropopause]], and the lower section of the [[stratosphere]]. Mesoscale timescales last from less than a day to weeks. The events typically of interest are [[thunderstorm]]s, [[squall line]]s, [[weather front|fronts]], [[rainbands|precipitation bands]] in [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] and [[extratropical cyclone]]s, and topographically generated weather systems such as mountain waves and [[sea breeze|sea and land breezes]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary Online Glossary of Meteorology]'', [[American Meteorological Society]] [http://www.ametsoc.org/], 2nd Ed., 2000, [http://www.allenpress.com Allen Press].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synoptic scale===
[[File:Surface analysis.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|[[NOAA]]: Synoptic scale weather analysis.]]
{{Main article|Synoptic scale meteorology}}

Synoptic scale meteorology predicts atmospheric changes at scales up to 1000&amp;nbsp;km and 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; sec (28 days), in time and space. At the synoptic scale, the [[Coriolis acceleration]] acting on moving air masses (outside of the tropics) plays a dominant role in predictions. The phenomena typically described by [[synoptic meteorology]] include events such as extratropical cyclones, baroclinic troughs and ridges, [[weather front|frontal zones]], and to some extent [[jet stream]]s. All of these are typically given on [[weather map]]s for a specific time. The minimum horizontal scale of synoptic phenomena is limited to the spacing between [[weather station|surface observation stations]].&lt;ref&gt;Bluestein, H., ''&lt;u&gt;Synoptic-Dynamic Meteorology in Midlatitudes: Principles of Kinematics and Dynamics, Vol. 1&lt;/u&gt;'', Oxford University Press, 1992; {{ISBN|0-19-506267-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global scale===
[[File:WOA09 sea-surf TMP AYool.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Annual mean sea surface temperatures.]]

Global scale meteorology is the study of weather patterns related to the transport of heat from the [[tropics]] to the [[Geographical pole|poles]]. Very large scale oscillations are of importance at this scale. These oscillations have time periods typically on the order of months, such as the [[Madden–Julian oscillation]], or years, such as the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] and the [[Pacific decadal oscillation]]. Global scale meteorology pushes into the range of climatology. The traditional definition of climate is pushed into larger timescales and with the understanding of the longer time scale global oscillations, their effect on climate and weather disturbances can be included in the synoptic and mesoscale timescales predictions.

Numerical Weather Prediction is a main focus in understanding air–sea interaction, tropical meteorology, atmospheric predictability, and tropospheric/stratospheric processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/sec7532.htm Global Modelling], US Naval Research Laboratory, Monterey, Ca.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Naval Research Laboratory]] in Monterey, California, developed a global atmospheric model called [[Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System]] (NOGAPS). NOGAPS is run operationally at [[Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center]] for the United States Military. Many other global atmospheric models are run by national meteorological agencies.

==Some meteorological principles==

===Boundary layer meteorology===
[[Boundary layer]] meteorology is the study of processes in the air layer directly above Earth's surface, known as the [[Planetary boundary layer|atmospheric boundary layer]] (ABL). The effects of the surface&amp;nbsp;– heating, cooling, and [[friction]]&amp;nbsp;– cause [[turbulence|turbulent mixing]] within the air layer. Significant movement  of [[sensible heat|heat]], [[matter]], or [[momentum]] on time scales of less than a day are caused by turbulent motions.&lt;ref&gt;''Garratt, J.R., ''&lt;u&gt;The atmospheric boundary layer&lt;/u&gt;'', Cambridge University Press, 1992; {{ISBN|0-521-38052-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Boundary layer meteorology includes the study of all types of surface–atmosphere boundary, including ocean, lake, urban land and non-urban land for the study of meteorology.

===Dynamic meteorology===
Dynamic meteorology generally focuses on the [[fluid dynamics]] of the atmosphere. The idea of [[air parcel]] is used to define the smallest element of the atmosphere, while ignoring the discrete molecular and chemical nature of the atmosphere. An air parcel is defined as a point in the fluid continuum of the atmosphere. The fundamental laws of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and motion are used to study the atmosphere. The physical quantities that characterize the state of the atmosphere are temperature, density, pressure, etc. These variables have unique values in the continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, J.R. [2004].

Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] at a future time and given location. Humans have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since at least the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mistic House, [http://www.mistichouse.com/astrology-lessons.htm Astrology Lessons, History, Prediction, Skeptics, and Astrology Compatibility], Retrieved on 2008-01-12, Archived at: {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608133837/http://www.mistichouse.com/astrology-lessons.htm |date=June 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric D.

Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, [[teleconnection]]s, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The [[chaos theory|chaotic]] nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the ''range'' of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.&lt;ref name="Klaus"&gt;Klaus Weickmann, Jeff Whitaker, Andres Roubicek and Catherine Smith.

Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow, and [[wind chill]], forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them.

===Aviation meteorology===
Aviation meteorology deals with the impact of weather on [[air traffic control|air traffic management]]. It is important for air crews to understand the implications of weather on their flight plan as well as their aircraft, as noted by the [[Aeronautical Information Manual]]:&lt;ref&gt;An international version called the [[Aeronautical Information Publication]] contains parallel information, as well as specific information on the international airports for use by the international community.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The effects of ice on aircraft are cumulative—thrust is reduced, drag increases, lift lessens, and weight increases. The results are an increase in stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance. In extreme cases, 2 to 3 inches of ice can form on the leading edge of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes. It takes but 1/2 inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage.''&lt;ref&gt;''"7-1-22. PIREPs Relating to Airframe Icing"'', [February 16, 2006], [[Aeronautical Information Manual]], [http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/AIM/ FAA AIM Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712031134/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/AIM/ |date=2009-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Agricultural meteorology===
Meteorologists, [[soil science|soil scientists]], agricultural hydrologists, and [[agronomy|agronomists]] are people concerned with studying the effects of weather and climate on plant distribution, [[crop yield]], water-use efficiency, [[phenology]] of plant and animal development, and the energy balance of managed and natural ecosystems. Conversely, they are interested in the role of vegetation on climate and weather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/503295/description?navopenmenu=-2 Agricultural and Forest Meteorology], Elsevier, {{ISSN|0168-1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrometeorology===
[[Hydrometeorology]] is the branch of meteorology that deals with the [[hydrologic cycle]], the water budget, and the rainfall statistics of [[storm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9041744/hydrometeorology Encyclopædia Britannica], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating (quantitative) precipitation, heavy rain, heavy snow, and highlights areas with the potential for flash flooding. Typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology, mesoscale and synoptic meteorology, and other geosciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html/about2.shtml About the HPC], NOAA/ National Weather Service, National Centers for Environmental Prediction, [http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/ Hydrometeorological Prediction Center], Camp Springs, Maryland, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The multidisciplinary nature of the branch can result in technical challenges, since tools and solutions from each of the individual disciplines involved may behave slightly differently, be optimized for different hard- and software platforms and use different data formats. There are some initiatives - such as the DRIHM project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drihm.eu/|title=Home|author=Super User|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; - that are trying to address this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drihm.eu/images/newsletter/newsletter%20drihm%2001.pdf DRIHM News, number 1, March 2012, p2] "An ideal environment for hydro-meteorology research at the European level"&lt;/ref&gt;

Maritime meteorology deals with air and wave forecasts for ships operating at sea. Organizations such as the [[Ocean Prediction Center]], Honolulu [[National Weather Service]] forecast office, United Kingdom [[Met Office]], and [[Japan Meteorological Agency|JMA]] prepare high seas forecasts for the world's oceans.

===Military meteorology===
{{Main article|Military meteorology}}

Military meteorology is the research and application of meteorology for [[military]] purposes. In the United States, the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Commander, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command]] oversees meteorological efforts for the Navy and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] while the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[Air Force Weather Agency]] is responsible for the Air Force and [[United States Army|Army]].

===Environmental meteorology===
Environmental meteorology mainly analyzes industrial pollution dispersion physically and chemically based on meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind, and various weather conditions.

===Renewable energy===
Meteorology applications in renewable energy includes basic research, "exploration", and potential mapping of wind power and solar radiation for wind and solar energy.

The '''Mira River''' originates in the [[Andes]] of Ecuador and flows to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in [[Colombia]]. For a few kilometers it forms the border between the two countries.  The upper course of the Mira is called the [[Chota, Ecuador|Chota River]] and is notable for its [[Afro-Ecuadorian]] inhabitants, its [[Bomba (Ecuador)|bomba]] music, and the large number of internationally-prominent [[Association Football|soccer]] players it has produced.   

==Course==
'''High Andes'''. The most distant source of the Mira River may be Puruanta Lake, located at an elevation of {{convert|3473|m|ft}} in the [[Cayambe Coca Ecological Reserve]] of northern Ecuador. The cities of [[Ibarra, Ecuador|Ibarra]] and [[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]] are in the upper drainage basin of the river which includes most of [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]] and [[Carchi]] provinces. The borders of the two provinces run roughly along the course of the Mira.&lt;ref&gt;Google Earth&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Ecuador June 2013 23508 f.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pedestrian foot bridge across the Chota River at Pusir. 0° 27′ 33′ N 77° 59′ 50′ W]]
'''Chota River and Chota Valley.'''  Several tributaries unite to form the Chota River north of the town of Pimampiro at an elevation of {{convert|1700|m|ft}}.  The Chota valley, deep, but wide and fertile in places, extends along the river for about {{convert|35|km|mi}} to the village of Concepcion at an elevation of {{convert|1300|m|ft}} Below the junction of the Chota and Piguchuela rivers, the river is called the Mira. The climate is semi-arid with precipitation on the valley floor as low as {{convert|500|mm|inch}} per year.  Irrigation is necessary for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, D. A. (June, 1965), "Negro, Mestizo and Indian in an Andean Environment",''The Geographical Journal'', Vol. 131, No. 2, p. 225. Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The relatively low elevation (for the Andes) of the Chota Valley has resulted since prehistoric times in the valley being used to grow warm-climate and semi-tropical crops: [[coca]], [[cotton]], [[chile peppers]], [[maize]], and fruits.  A class of traders called ''mindaeles'', exchanged the semi-tropical crops of the valley with the people of the [[Inca-Caranqui|Pais Caraqui]] chiefdoms of the surrounding higher and cooler elevations.  Beginning in the 16th century, the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] introduced additional crops, especially [[sugar cane]], [[olive]]s. and [[grapes]].&lt;ref&gt;"La Cuenca del Rio Mira y Concepcion", p.. 31-42 and map,  http://biblioteca.centroafroecuatoriano.org.ec/files/4413/7166/0352/Cuenca_del_Ro_Mira_y_concepcion.pdf, accessed 19 July 2017; Preston, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transition'''.  A few miles north of Concepcion, the Mira begins its flow through a narrow, sparsely-populated canyon bordered by forested uplands which persist to near the Colombian border, dropping in elevation over the course of {{convert|100|km|mi}} from {{convert|1200|m|ft}} near Conception to {{convert|100|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;"Case study 4: Study of the Santiago and Mira River Basins", https://www.oas.org/dsd/publications/Unit/oea03e/ch09.htm, accessed 20 Jul 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  THe Mira in this section and upstream in the Chota Valley is popular for [[rafting]] and [[kayaking]] as there are many [[International Scale of River Difficulty|Class III and IV rapids]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mira River," Barefoot Expeditions, http://www.barefootexpeditions.com/rafting-rio-mira-ecuador, accessed 20 Jul 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal.''' The Mira River is navigable for the {{convert|88|km|mi}} it flows through [[Nariño Department]] of Colombia to the Pacific  The Mira is joined by the San Juan river, a major tributary.  This is a [[rainforest]] region with only a small population devoted mostly to the cultivation of [[bananas]] and [[Elaeis guineensis|African oil Palm]].&lt;ref&gt;"Vertientes Hidrográficas de Colombia, http://www.todacolombia.com/geografia-colombia/vertientes-colombia.html, accessed 20 Jul 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afro-Ecuadorians, bomba, and soccer==
African slaves were brought to Ecuador beginning in the 16th century.  In the 17th and 18th century [[Jesuit]] missionaries owned most of the land in the Chota valley and imported  Africans to work as slaves on their sugar cane plantations.  By 1767, when the Jesuits were expelled from Latin America, the Jesuits owned 10 plantations and 1,769 slaves in the Chota valley.&lt;ref&gt;http://biblioteca.centroafroecuatoriano.org.ec/files/4413/7166/0352/Cuenca_del_Ro_Mira_y_concepcion.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the Afro-Ecuadorians experienced little change with the departure of the Jesuits, continuing to be enslaved by the new owners of the plantations.&lt;ref&gt;"Forgotten Territories, Unrealized Rights: A Report from the Rapoport Delgation on Afro-Ecuadorian Land Rights (Nov. 2009), https://law.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/02/ecuador-eng.pdf, accessed 21 Jul 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery was abolished in Ecuador in 1852 and most of the Afro-Ecuadorian residents of the Chota Valley became landless [[sharecroppers]], a condition which continued until the late 20th century.  The population of the Chota Valley in 1987 was almost entirely Afro-Ecuadorian concentrated in 10 to 15 villages and totaling less than 15,000. The surrounding highlands had a [[mestizo]] and [[indigenous people of the Americas|Indigenous]] population.&lt;ref&gt;Lipski, John M. (1987), "The Chota Valley: Afro-Hispanic Language in Highland Ecuador," ''Latin American Research Review'', Vol 22, No. 1, pp 157-158. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of the Afro-Ecuadorians obtained land after [[Land Reform]] legislation in 1964, but in the early 21st century, the majority of Afro-Ecuadorians in the Chota valley were still impoverished and landless or nearly landless.&lt;ref&gt;https://law.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/02/ecuador-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chota valley is known for its bomba music which features African drums mixed with indigenous and Spanish influences.  It has also become known as the origin of many of Ecuador's finest soccer players.  The 2002 Ecuadorian team, which qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]], had seven Afro-Ecuadorians from the Chota valley on its 23-man roster.  This despite the absence of grass soccer fields and training facilities for young players in the Chota valley.&lt;ref&gt;''Lonely Planet: Ecuador &amp; the Galapagos Islands; (2006)'', Lonely Planet, 7th Edition, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Raza's tenure as [[President/Vice Chancellor]] of [[Delhi University]] is regarded as one of the least controversial and academically productive in the institution's history. Raza was one of the co-founders of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Raza oversaw the landscaping of the new campus and named all hostels/campusses at JNU. Raza is also believed to have strengthened the liberal ethos of Jawaharlal Nehru University. He is fondly remembered by his students for "Raza's Law of Ignorance", according to which "the ratio of the known and the known-to-be-unknown always remains constant". 

Raza held a large number of positions at departments and commissions operated by the [[Government of India]]. He received an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] degree from [[Tufts University]], USA, in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trustees.tufts.edu/hondegree/degrees/|title=Honorary Degrees - Office of the Trustees|website=trustees.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a creator of and an original signatory to the [[Talloires Declaration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainability.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/Sustainability-Council-Report-2013-Final.pdf |format=PDF |title=Campus Sustainability Council Report |website=Sustainability.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; a ten-point action plan devised by the Association of University Leaders for a sustainable future.

Raza died of cardiac arrest in [[Boston]], [[United States|U.S.]] on 19 July 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZfXxYOax2IC&amp;pg=PA131 | title=Indian Geography: Voice of Concern | first=Anu | last=Kapur | year=2002 | publisher=Concept Publishing Company | page=131 | isbn=9788170229803 | accessdate=16 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Teichbau2-Teichfolie.JPG|thumb|Pond liner for a garden pond]]

A '''pond liner''' is an impermeable [[geomembrane]] used for  retention of liquids, including the lining of reservoirs, retention basins, hazardous and nonhazardous surface impoundments, [[garden pond]]s and artificial streams in parks and gardens.

==Installation==

Pond liners need to be protected from sharp objects (for example, stones) below the liner and from being punctured by any objects in the water body. Protection can be provided with layers of sand, geotextiles (particularly needle-punched nonwovens) and other materials. Pond liners are manufactured in rolls or accordion-folded on pallets. When deployed in the field their edges and ends are overlapped and seamed together. Methods are thermal fusion, solvents, adhesives and tapes.

The edge of the pond liner is generally rolled over the top of the soil slope and secured in an anchor trench or it can be fixed to a vertical wall made of wood or concrete. Box-shaped pond liners can be made for rectangular structures. The vast majority of flexible pond liners (aka, geomembranes) are available commercially and are manufactured using the following [[polymer]]s; HDPE, LLDPE, fPP, PVC, EPDM. They can also be manufactured with a fabric scrim between two plys of the polymer, e.g., PE-R, CSPE-R, fPP-R and EPDM-R. Geomembranes can also be made in-situ by spraying a polymer ([[polyurea]], or equal) directly on a geotextile substrate. The lifetime of these various ponds liners depends greatly on whether they are exposed or covered.&lt;ref&gt;(1) Koerner, R. M. (2012) Designing With Geosynthetics, Xlibris Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} Clay liners can also be used which have extremely long lifetimes as long as they do not dry and crack by shrinkage and/or settlement.&lt;ref&gt;(2) [http://www.aquahabitat.com/pond.liners.html#pond-liner-longevity Aquatic Biologists' summary of pond liners and sealing]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''prisoner's dilemma''' is a standard example of a game analyzed in [[game theory]] that shows why two completely [[Rationality#Economics|rational]] individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by [[Merrill Flood]] and [[Melvin Dresher]] while working at [[RAND Corporation|RAND]] in 1950. [[Albert W. Tucker]] formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it "prisoner's dilemma",&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; presenting it as follows:

{{quote|Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The offer is:
* If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison
* If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison (and vice versa)
* If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve one year in prison (on the lesser charge).}}

It is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested prisoners will betray the other, meaning the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Milovsky|first=Nicholas|title=The Basics of Game Theory and Associated Games|url=http://issuu.com/johnsonnick895/docs/game_theory_paper|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads both of the prisoners to betray when they would get a better reward if they both kept silent. In reality, humans display a [[systemic bias]] towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games despite what is predicted by simple models of "rational" self-interested action.&lt;ref name = Fehr&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fehr | first1= Ernst | last2=Fischbacher | first2=Urs   | date= Oct 23, 2003 | title=The Nature of human altruism |journal=Nature | volume=425 | pages=785–91 | publisher=Nature Publishing Group| doi=10.1038/nature02043 | url=http://www.iwp.jku.at/born/mpwfst/04/nature02043_f_born.pdf | accessdate=February 27, 2013 | pmid=14574401 | issue=6960|bibcode = 2003Natur.425..785F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Amos&gt;{{cite book | title=Preference, belief, and similarity: selected writings. | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press | first1= Amos | last1=Tversky | first2=Eldar | last2=Shafir | url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/PAPER-SUGGESTIONS/Preference,%20Belief,%20and%20Similarity%20Selected%20Writings%20(Bradford%20Books).pdf  | year=2004 | isbn=9780262700931 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Toh-Kyeong|first1 = Ahn|last2 = Ostrom|first2 = Elinor|last3 = Walker|first3 = James|date = Sep 5, 2002|title = Incorporating Motivational Heterogeneity into Game-Theoretic Models of Collective Action|journal = Public Choice|volume = 117|issue = 3–4|pages = 295–314|publisher = |doi =10.1023/b:puch.0000003739.54365.fd |url = http://www.indiana.edu/~workshop/seminars/papers/ahnostromwalker_092402.pdf|accessdate = June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hessel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Oosterbeek|first1 = Hessel|last2 = Sloof|first2 = Randolph|last3 = Van de Kuilen|first3 = Gus|date = Dec 3, 2003|title = Cultural Differences in Ultimatum Game Experiments: Evidence from a Meta-Analysis|journal = Experimental Economics|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 171–88|publisher = Springer Science and Business Media B.V|doi = 10.1023/B:EXEC.0000026978.14316.74|url = http://www.econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/~yhamagu/ultimatum.pdf|accessdate = February 27, 2013|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130512175243/http://www.econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/~yhamagu/ultimatum.pdf|archivedate = May 12, 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extended "iterated" version of the game also exists. In this version, the classic game is played repeatedly between the same prisoners, who continuously have the opportunity to penalize the other for previous decisions. If the number of times the game will be played is known to the players, then (by [[backward induction]]) two classically rational players will betray each other repeatedly, for the same reasons as the single-shot variant. In an infinite or unknown length game there is no fixed optimum strategy, and prisoner's dilemma tournaments have been held to compete and test algorithms for such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://egtheory.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/ipd/|title = Short history of iterated prisoner's dilemma tournaments|date = March 2, 2015|access-date = February 8, 2016|website = Theory, Evolution, and Games Group|publisher = |last = Kaznatcheev|first = Artem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prisoner's dilemma game can be used as a model for many [[#Real-life examples|real world situations]] involving cooperative behavior. In casual usage, the label "prisoner's dilemma" may be applied to situations not strictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games: for instance, those in which two entities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so, but find it difficult or expensive—not necessarily impossible—to coordinate their activities.

==Strategy for the prisoner's dilemma==

Two prisoners are separated into individual rooms and cannot communicate with each other.
The normal game is shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! {{diagonal split header|&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner A|Prisoner B}} !! Prisoner B stays silent&lt;br&gt;(''cooperates'') !! Prisoner B betrays&lt;br&gt;(''defects'')
|-
! Prisoner A stays silent&lt;br&gt;(''cooperates'')
| Each serves 1 year|| Prisoner A: 3 years&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner B: goes free
|-
! Prisoner A betrays&lt;br&gt;(''defects'')
| Prisoner A: goes free&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner B: 3 years || Each serves 2 years
|}

It is assumed that both prisoners understand the nature of the game, have no loyalty to each other, and will have no opportunity for retribution or reward outside the game. Regardless of what the other decides, each prisoner gets a higher reward by betraying the other ("defecting"). The reasoning involves an argument by [[Dilemma#Use in logic|dilemma]]: B will either cooperate or defect. If B cooperates, A should defect, because going free is better than serving 1 year. If B defects, A should also defect, because serving 2 years is better than serving 3. So either way, A should defect. Parallel reasoning will show that B should defect.

Because defection always results in a better payoff than cooperation regardless of the other player's choice, it is a [[dominant strategy]]. Mutual defection is the only strong [[Nash equilibrium]] in the game (i.e. the only outcome from which each player could only do worse by unilaterally changing strategy). The dilemma, then, is that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome than mutual defection but is not the rational outcome because the choice to cooperate, from a self-interested perspective, is irrational.

==Generalized form==
The structure of the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma can be generalized from its original prisoner setting. Suppose that the two players are represented by the colors, red and blue, and that each player chooses to either "Cooperate" or "Defect".

If both players cooperate, they both receive the reward ''R'' for cooperating. If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff ''P''. If Blue defects while Red cooperates, then Blue receives the temptation payoff ''T'', while Red receives the "sucker's" payoff, ''S''. Similarly, if Blue cooperates while Red defects, then Blue receives the sucker's payoff ''S'', while Red receives the temptation payoff ''T''.

This can be expressed in [[Normal-form game|normal form]]:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Canonical PD payoff matrix
! {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|Blue}}|{{color|#900|Red}}}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Cooperate}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Defect}}
|-
! scope="row" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#009|Cooperate}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''R''}}|{{color|#900|''R''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''S''}}|{{color|#900|''T''}}|transparent}}
|-
! scope="row" | {{color|#009|Defect}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''T''}}|{{color|#900|''S''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''P''}}|{{color|#900|''P''}}|transparent}}
|}

and to be a prisoner's dilemma game in the strong sense, the following condition must hold for the payoffs:

:''T'' &gt; ''R'' &gt; ''P'' &gt; ''S''

The payoff relationship ''R'' &gt; ''P'' implies that mutual cooperation is superior to mutual defection, while the payoff relationships ''T'' &gt; ''R'' and ''P'' &gt; ''S'' imply that defection is the [[dominant strategy]] for both agents.

===Special case: Donation game===
The "donation game"&lt;ref name=Hilbe2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilbe|first=Christian |author2=Martin A. Nowak |author3=Karl Sigmund|title=Evolution of extortion in Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games|journal=PNAS|date=April 2013|volume=110|issue=17|pages=6913–18|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/17/6913.abstract|accessdate=25 November 2013|doi=10.1073/pnas.1214834110|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.6913H |arxiv=1212.1067}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of prisoner's dilemma in which cooperation corresponds to offering the other player a benefit ''b'' at a personal cost ''c'' with ''b'' &gt; ''c''. Defection means offering nothing. The payoff matrix is thus

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! {{diagonal split header|{{navy (color)|Blue}}|{{color|#900|Red}}}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Cooperate}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Defect}}
|-
! scope="row" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#009|Cooperate}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''b''-''c''}}|{{color|#900|''b''-''c''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|-''c''}}|{{color|#900|''b''}}|transparent}}
|-
! scope="row" | {{color|#009|Defect}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''b''}}|{{color|#900|-''c''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|0}}|{{color|#900|0}}|transparent}}
|}

Note that {{tmath|2R&gt;T+S}} (i.e. {{tmath|2(b-c)&gt;b-c}}) which qualifies the donation game to be an iterated game (see next section).

The donation game may be applied to markets. Suppose X grows oranges, Y grows apples. The [[marginal utility]] of an apple to the orange-grower X is ''b'', which is higher than the marginal utility (''c'') of an orange, since X has a surplus of oranges and no apples. Similarly, for apple-grower Y, the marginal utility of an orange is ''b'' while the marginal utility of an apple is ''c''. If X and Y contract to exchange an apple and an orange, and each fulfills their end of the deal, then each receive a payoff of ''b''-''c''. If one "defects" and does not deliver as promised, the defector will receive a payoff of ''b'', while the cooperator will lose ''c''. If both defect, then neither one gains or loses anything.

==The iterated prisoner's dilemma==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
If two players play prisoner's dilemma more than once in succession and they remember previous actions of their opponent and change their strategy accordingly, the game is called iterated prisoner's dilemma.

In addition to the general form above, the iterative version also requires that 2''R'' &gt; ''T'' + ''S,'' to prevent alternating cooperation and defection giving a greater reward than mutual cooperation.

The iterated prisoner's dilemma game is fundamental to some theories of human cooperation and trust. On the assumption that the game can model transactions between two people requiring trust, cooperative behaviour in populations may be modeled by a multi-player, iterated, version of the game. It has, consequently, fascinated many scholars over the years. In 1975, Grofman and Pool estimated the count of scholarly articles devoted to it at over 2,000. The iterated prisoner's dilemma has also been referred to as the "[[Peace war game|Peace-War game]]".&lt;ref name = Shy&gt;{{cite book | title= Industrial Organization: Theory and Applications | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press | first1= Oz | last1=Shy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tr4CjJ5LlRcC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=industrial+organization+theory+and+applications  | year=1995 | isbn=0262193663 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the game is played exactly ''N'' times and both players know this, then it is optimal to defect in all rounds. The only possible [[Nash equilibrium]] is to always defect. The proof is [[Mathematical induction|inductive]]: one might as well defect on the last turn, since the opponent will not have a chance to later retaliate. Therefore, both will defect on the last turn. Thus, the player might as well defect on the second-to-last turn, since the opponent will defect on the last no matter what is done, and so on.  The same applies if the game length is unknown but has a known upper limit.

Unlike the standard prisoner's dilemma, in the iterated prisoner's dilemma the defection strategy is counter-intuitive and fails badly to predict the behavior of human players. Within standard economic theory, though, this is the only correct answer.  The [[superrational]] strategy in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with fixed ''N'' is to cooperate against a superrational opponent, and in the limit of large ''N'', experimental results on strategies agree with the superrational version, not the game-theoretic rational one.

For cooperation to emerge between game theoretic rational players, the total number of rounds ''N'' must be unknown to the players. In this case 'always defect' may no longer be a strictly dominant strategy, only a Nash equilibrium. Amongst results shown by [[Robert Aumann]] in a 1959 paper, rational players repeatedly interacting for indefinitely long games can sustain the cooperative outcome.

===Strategy for the iterated prisoner's dilemma===
Interest in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) was kindled by [[Robert Axelrod]] in his book ''[[The Evolution of Cooperation]]'' (1984). In it he reports on a tournament he organized of the ''N'' step prisoner's dilemma (with ''N'' fixed) in which participants have to choose their mutual strategy again and again, and have memory of their previous encounters. Axelrod invited academic colleagues all over the world to devise computer strategies to compete in an IPD tournament. The programs that were entered varied widely in algorithmic complexity, initial hostility, capacity for forgiveness, and so forth.

Axelrod discovered that when these encounters were repeated over a long period of time with many players, each with different strategies, greedy strategies tended to do very poorly in the long run while more [[altruism|altruistic]] strategies did better, as judged purely by self-interest. He used this to show a possible mechanism for the evolution of altruistic behaviour from mechanisms that are initially purely selfish, by [[natural selection]].

The winning [[deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] strategy was [[tit for tat]], which [[Anatol Rapoport]] developed and entered into the tournament. It was the simplest of any program entered, containing only four lines of [[BASIC]], and won the contest. The strategy is simply to cooperate on the first iteration of the game; after that, the player does what his or her opponent did on the previous move. Depending on the situation, a slightly better strategy can be "tit for tat with forgiveness". When the opponent defects, on the next move, the player sometimes cooperates anyway, with a small probability (around 1–5%). This allows for occasional recovery from getting trapped in a cycle of defections. The exact probability depends on the line-up of opponents.

By analysing the top-scoring strategies, Axelrod stated several conditions necessary for a strategy to be successful.

; Nice: The most important condition is that the strategy must be "nice", that is, it will not defect before its opponent does (this is sometimes referred to as an "optimistic" algorithm). Almost all of the top-scoring strategies were nice; therefore, a purely selfish strategy will not "cheat" on its opponent, for purely self-interested reasons first.
; Retaliating: However, Axelrod contended, the successful strategy must not be a blind optimist. It must sometimes retaliate. An example of a non-retaliating strategy is Always Cooperate. This is a very bad choice, as "nasty" strategies will ruthlessly exploit such players.
; Forgiving: Successful strategies must also be forgiving. Though players will retaliate, they will once again fall back to cooperating if the opponent does not continue to defect. This stops long runs of revenge and counter-revenge, maximizing points.
; Non-envious: The last quality is being non-envious, that is not striving to score more than the opponent.

The optimal (points-maximizing) strategy for the one-time PD game is simply defection; as explained above, this is true whatever the composition of opponents may be. However, in the iterated-PD game the optimal strategy depends upon the strategies of likely opponents, and how they will react to defections and cooperations. For example, consider a population where everyone defects every time, except for a single individual following the tit for tat strategy. That individual is at a slight disadvantage because of the loss on the first turn. In such a population, the optimal strategy for that individual is to defect every time. In a population with a certain percentage of always-defectors and the rest being tit for tat players, the optimal strategy for an individual depends on the percentage, and on the length of the game.

In the strategy called Pavlov, [[win-stay, lose-switch]], faced with a failure to cooperate, the player switches strategy the next turn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/93/7/2686.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In certain circumstances,{{specify|date=November 2012}} Pavlov beats all other strategies by giving preferential treatment to co-players using a similar strategy.

Deriving the optimal strategy is generally done in two ways:
# [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium|Bayesian Nash Equilibrium]]: If the statistical distribution of opposing strategies can be determined (e.g. 50% tit for tat, 50% always cooperate) an optimal counter-strategy can be derived analytically.&lt;ref name="bne"&gt;For example see the 2003 study [http://econ.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~mbengad/seminars/whole1.pdf  "Bayesian Nash equilibrium; a statistical test of the hypothesis"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051002195142/http://econ.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~mbengad/seminars/whole1.pdf |date=2005-10-02 }} for discussion of the concept and whether it can apply in real [[economic]] or strategic situations (from [[Tel Aviv University]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulations of populations have been made, where individuals with low scores die off, and those with high scores reproduce (a [[genetic algorithm]] for finding an optimal strategy). The mix of algorithms in the final population generally depends on the mix in the initial population. The introduction of mutation (random variation during reproduction) lessens the dependency on the initial population; empirical experiments with such systems tend to produce tit for tat players (see for instance Chess 1988),{{Clarify|date=August 2016}} but no analytic proof exists that this will always occur.

Although tit for tat is considered to be the most [[robust]] basic strategy, a team from [[Southampton University]] in England (led by [[Nick Jennings (computer scientist)|Professor Nicholas Jennings]] and consisting of Rajdeep Dash, Sarvapali Ramchurn, Alex Rogers, Perukrishnen Vytelingum) introduced a new strategy at the 20th-anniversary iterated prisoner's dilemma competition, which proved to be more successful than tit for tat. This strategy relied on collusion between programs to achieve the highest number of points for a single program. The university submitted 60 programs to the competition, which were designed to recognize each other through a series of five to ten moves at the start.&lt;ref name="southamptonstrategy"&gt;[http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2004/oct/04_151.shtml : University of Southampton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421055745/http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2004/oct/04_151.shtml |date=2014-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once this recognition was made, one program would always cooperate and the other would always defect, assuring the maximum number of points for the defector. If the program realized that it was playing a non-Southampton player, it would continuously defect in an attempt to minimize the score of the competing program. As a result,&lt;ref name="southamptontrick"&gt;[http://www.prisoners-dilemma.com/results/cec04/ipd_cec04_full_run.html The 2004 Prisoners' Dilemma Tournament Results] show [[University of Southampton]]'s strategies in the first three places, despite having fewer wins and many more losses than the GRIM strategy. (Note that in a PD tournament, the aim of the game is not to "win" matches&amp;nbsp;– that can easily be achieved by frequent defection). It should also be pointed out that even without implicit collusion between [[computer program|software strategies]] (exploited by the Southampton team) tit for tat is not always the absolute winner of any given tournament; it would be more precise to say that its long run results over a series of tournaments outperform its rivals. (In any one event a given strategy can be slightly better adjusted to the competition than tit for tat, but tit for tat is more robust). The same applies for the tit for tat with forgiveness variant, and other optimal strategies: on any given day they might not 'win' against a specific mix of counter-strategies. An alternative way of putting it is using the Darwinian [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|ESS]] simulation. In such a simulation, tit for tat will almost always come to dominate, though nasty strategies will drift in and out of the population because a tit for tat population is penetrable by non-retaliating nice strategies, which in turn are easy prey for the nasty strategies. Richard Dawkins showed that here, no static mix of strategies form a stable equilibrium and the system will always oscillate between bounds.&lt;/ref&gt; this strategy ended up taking the top three positions in the competition, as well as a number of positions towards the bottom.

This strategy takes advantage of the fact that multiple entries were allowed in this particular competition and that the performance of a team was measured by that of the highest-scoring player (meaning that the use of self-sacrificing players was a form of [[minmaxing]]). In a competition where one has control of only a single player, tit for tat is certainly a better strategy. Because of this new rule, this competition also has little theoretical significance when analysing single agent strategies as compared to Axelrod's seminal tournament. However, it provided a basis for analysing how to achieve cooperative strategies in multi-agent frameworks, especially in the presence of noise. In fact, long before this new-rules tournament was played, [[Richard Dawkins]] in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' pointed out the possibility of such strategies winning if multiple entries were allowed, but he remarked that most probably Axelrod would not have allowed them if they had been submitted. It also relies on circumventing rules about the prisoner's dilemma in that there is no communication allowed between the two players, which the Southampton programs arguably did with their opening "ten move dance" to recognize one another; this only reinforces just how valuable communication can be in shifting the balance of the game.

===Stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma===

In a stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma game, strategies are specified by in terms of "cooperation probabilities".&lt;ref name=Press2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Press|first1=WH|last2=Dyson|first2=FJ|title=Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma contains strategies that dominate any evolutionary opponent|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|date=26 June 2012|volume=109|issue=26|pages=10409–13|doi=10.1073/pnas.1206569109|pmid=22615375|pmc=3387070|bibcode=2012PNAS..10910409P}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an encounter between player ''X'' and player ''Y'', ''X'' 's strategy is specified by a set of probabilities ''P'' of cooperating with ''Y''. ''P'' is a function of the outcomes of their previous encounters or some subset thereof. If ''P'' is a function of only their most recent ''n'' encounters, it is called a "memory-n" strategy. A memory-1 strategy is then specified by four cooperation probabilities:  &lt;math&gt;P=\{P_{cc},P_{cd},P_{dc},P_{dd}\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''X'' will cooperate in the present encounter given that the previous encounter was characterized by (ab). For example, if the previous encounter was one in which ''X'' cooperated and ''Y'' defected, then &lt;math&gt;P_{cd}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''X'' will cooperate in the present encounter. If each of the probabilities are either 1 or 0, the strategy is called deterministic. An example of a deterministic strategy is the "[[tit for tat]]" strategy written as ''P''={1,0,1,0}, in which ''X'' responds as ''Y'' did in the previous encounter. Another is the [[win–stay, lose–switch]] strategy written as ''P''={1,0,0,1}, in which ''X'' responds as in the previous encounter, if it was a "win" (i.e. cc or dc) but changes strategy if it was a loss (i.e. cd or dd). It has been shown that for any memory-n strategy there is a corresponding memory-1 strategy which gives the same statistical results, so that only memory-1 strategies need be considered.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;

If we define ''P'' as the above 4-element strategy vector of ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;Q=\{Q_{cc},Q_{cd},Q_{dc},Q_{dd}\}&lt;/math&gt; as the 4-element strategy vector of ''Y'', a transition matrix ''M'' may be defined for ''X'' whose ''ij'' th entry is the probability that the outcome of a particular encounter between ''X'' and ''Y'' will be ''j'' given that the previous encounter was ''i'', where ''i'' and ''j'' are one of the four outcome indices: ''cc'', ''cd'', ''dc'', or ''dd''. For example, from ''X'' 's point of view, the probability that the outcome of the present encounter is ''cd'' given that the previous encounter was ''cd'' is equal to &lt;math&gt;M_{cd,cd}=P_{cd}(1-Q_{dc})&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that the indices for ''Q'' are from ''Y'' 's point of view: a ''cd'' outcome for ''X'' is a ''dc'' outcome for ''Y''.)  Under these definitions, the iterated prisoner's dilemma qualifies as a [[stochastic process]] and ''M'' is a [[stochastic matrix]], allowing all of the theory of stochastic processes to be applied.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;

One result of stochastic theory is that there exists a stationary vector ''v'' for the matrix ''M'' such that &lt;math&gt;v\cdot M=v&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, it may be specified that ''v'' is normalized so that the sum of its four components is unity. The ''ij'' th entry in &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt; will give the probability that the outcome of an encounter between ''X'' and ''Y'' will be ''j'' given that the encounter ''n'' steps previous is ''i''. In the limit as ''n'' approaches infinity, ''M'' will converge to a matrix with fixed values, giving the long-term probabilities of an encounter producing ''j'' which will be independent of ''i''. In other words, the rows of &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt; will be identical, giving the long-term equilibrium result probabilities of the iterated prisoners dilemma without the need to explicitly evaluate a large number of interactions. It can be seen that ''v'' is a stationary vector for &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt; and particularly &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, so that each row of &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt; will be equal to ''v''. Thus the stationary vector specifies the equilibrium outcome probabilities for ''X''. Defining &lt;math&gt;S_x=\{R,S,T,P\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_y=\{R,T,S,P\}&lt;/math&gt; as the short-term payoff vectors for the {cc,cd,dc,dd} outcomes (From ''X'' 's point of view), the equilibrium payoffs for ''X'' and ''Y'' can now be specified as &lt;math&gt;s_x=v\cdot S_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_y=v\cdot S_y&lt;/math&gt;, allowing the two strategies ''P'' and ''Q'' to be compared for their long term payoffs.

====Zero-determinant strategies====

[[File:IPD Venn.svg|right|thumb|600px|The relationship between zero-determinant (ZD), cooperating and defecting strategies in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) illustrated in a [[Venn diagram]]. Cooperating strategies always cooperate with other cooperating strategies, and defecting strategies always defect against other defecting strategies. Both contain subsets of strategies that are robust under strong selection, meaning no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade such strategies when they are resident in a population. Only cooperating strategies contain a subset that are always robust, meaning that no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade and replace such strategies, under both strong and [[weak selection]]. The intersection between ZD and good cooperating strategies is the set of generous ZD strategies. Extortion strategies are the intersection between ZD and non-robust defecting strategies. Tit-for-tat lies at the intersection of cooperating, defecting and ZD strategies.]]

In 2012, [[William H. Press]] and [[Freeman Dyson]] published a new class of strategies for the stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma called "zero-determinant" (ZD) strategies.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt; The long term payoffs for encounters between ''X'' and ''Y'' can be expressed as the determinant of a matrix which is a function of the two strategies and the short term payoff vectors: &lt;math&gt;s_x=D(P,Q,S_x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_y=D(P,Q,S_y)&lt;/math&gt;, which do not involve the stationary vector ''v''. Since the determinant function &lt;math&gt;s_y=D(P,Q,f)&lt;/math&gt; is linear in ''f'', it follows that &lt;math&gt;\alpha s_x+\beta s_y+\gamma=D(P,Q,\alpha S_x+\beta S_y+\gamma U)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''U''={1,1,1,1}). Any strategies for which &lt;math&gt;D(P,Q,\alpha S_x+\beta S_y+\gamma U)=0&lt;/math&gt; is by definition a ZD strategy, and the long term payoffs obey the relation  &lt;math&gt;\alpha s_x+\beta s_y+\gamma=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Tit-for-tat is a ZD strategy which is "fair" in the sense of not gaining advantage over the other player. However, the ZD space also contains strategies that, in the case of two players, can allow one player to unilaterally set the other player's score or alternatively, force an evolutionary player to achieve a payoff some percentage lower than his own. The extorted player could defect but would thereby hurt himself by getting lower payoff. Thus, extortion solutions turn the iterated prisoner's dilemma into a sort of [[ultimatum game]]. Specifically, ''X'' is able to choose a strategy for which &lt;math&gt;D(P,Q,\beta S_y+\gamma U)=0&lt;/math&gt;, unilaterally setting &lt;math&gt;s_y&lt;/math&gt;  to a specific value within a particular range of values, independent of ''Y'' 's strategy, offering an opportunity for ''X'' to "extort" player ''Y'' (and vice versa). (It turns out that if ''X'' tries to set &lt;math&gt;s_x&lt;/math&gt; to a particular value, the range of possibilities is much smaller, only consisting of complete cooperation or complete defection.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;)

An extension of the IPD is an evolutionary stochastic IPD, in which the relative abundance of particular strategies is allowed to change, with more successful strategies relatively increasing. This process may be accomplished by having less successful players imitate the more successful strategies, or by eliminating less successful players from the game, while multiplying the more successful ones. It has been shown that unfair ZD strategies are not [[evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]]. The key intuition is that an evolutionarily stable strategy must not only be able to invade another population (which extortionary ZD strategies can do) but must also perform well against other players of the same type (which extortionary ZD players do poorly, because they reduce each other's surplus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adami|first=Christoph|author2=Arend Hintze|title=Evolutionary instability of Zero Determinant strategies demonstrates that winning isn't everything|year=2013|page=3|arxiv=1208.2666|doi=10.1038/ncomms3193|bibcode=2013NatCo...4E2193A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theory and simulations confirm that beyond a critical population size, ZD extortion loses out in evolutionary competition against more cooperative strategies, and as a result, the average payoff in the population increases when the population is bigger. In addition, there are some cases in which extortioners may even catalyze cooperation by helping to break out of a face-off between uniform defectors and [[win–stay, lose–switch]] agents.&lt;ref name=Hilbe2013 /&gt;

While extortionary ZD strategies are not stable in large populations, another ZD class called "generous" strategies ''is'' both stable and robust.  In fact, when the population is not too small, these strategies can supplant any other ZD strategy and even perform well against a broad array of generic strategies for iterated prisoner's dilemma, including win–stay, lose–switch. This was proven specifically for the [[Prisoner's dilemma#Special case: Donation game|donation game]] by Alexander Stewart and Joshua Plotkin in 2013.&lt;ref name=Stewart2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Alexander J.|author2=Joshua B. Plotkin|title=From extortion to generosity, evolution in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|year=2013|doi=10.1073/pnas.1306246110|volume=110|issue=38|pages=15348–53|bibcode=2013PNAS..11015348S|pmc=3780848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generous strategies will cooperate with other cooperative players, and in the face of defection, the generous player loses more utility than its rival. Generous strategies are the intersection of ZD strategies and so-called "good" strategies, which were defined by Akin (2013)&lt;ref name=Akin2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akin|first=Ethan|title=Stable Cooperative Solutions for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma|year=2013|page=9|arxiv=1211.0969|bibcode=2012arXiv1211.0969A}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be those for which the player responds to past mutual cooperation with future cooperation and splits expected payoffs equally if he receives at least the cooperative expected payoff. Among good strategies, the generous (ZD) subset performs well when the population is not too small. If the population is very small, defection strategies tend to dominate.&lt;ref name=Stewart2013 /&gt;

===Continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma===
Most work on the iterated prisoner's dilemma has focused on the discrete case, in which players either cooperate or defect, because this model is relatively simple to analyze. However, some researchers have looked at models of the continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma, in which players are able to make a variable contribution to the other player. Le and Boyd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Le | first1 = S. | last2 = Boyd | first2 = R. |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2007 | title = Evolutionary Dynamics of the Continuous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 245 | issue = 2| pages = 258–67 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.09.016 | pmid = 17125798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in such situations, cooperation is much harder to evolve than in the discrete iterated prisoner's dilemma. The basic intuition for this result is straightforward: in a continuous prisoner's dilemma, if a population starts off in a non-cooperative equilibrium, players who are only marginally more cooperative than non-cooperators get little benefit from [[assorting]] with one another. By contrast, in a discrete prisoner's dilemma, tit for tat cooperators get a big payoff boost from assorting with one another in a non-cooperative equilibrium, relative to non-cooperators. Since nature arguably offers more opportunities for variable cooperation rather than a strict dichotomy of cooperation or defection, the continuous prisoner's dilemma may help explain why real-life examples of tit for tat-like cooperation are extremely rare in nature (ex. Hammerstein&lt;ref&gt;Hammerstein, P. (2003). Why is reciprocity so rare in social animals? A protestant appeal. In: P. Hammerstein, Editor, Genetic and Cultural Evolution of Cooperation, MIT Press. pp. 83–94.
&lt;/ref&gt;) even though tit for tat seems robust in theoretical models.

===Emergence of stable strategies===
Players cannot seem to coordinate mutual cooperation, thus often get locked into the inferior yet stable strategy of defection.  In this way, iterated rounds facilitate the evolution of stable strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spaniel|first=William|title=Game Theory 101: The Complete Textbook|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iterated rounds often produce novel strategies, which have implications to complex social interaction. One such strategy is win-stay lose-shift. This strategy outperforms a simple Tit-For-Tat strategy&amp;nbsp;– that is, if you can get away with cheating, repeat that behavior, however if you get caught, switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nowak|first=Martin|author2=Karl Sigmund|title=A strategy of win-stay, lose-shift that outperforms tit-for-tat in the Prisoner's Dilemma game|journal=Nature|year=1993|volume=364|issue=6432|doi=10.1038/364056a0|pages=56–58|pmid=8316296|bibcode=1993Natur.364...56N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only problem of this tit-for-tat strategy is that they are vulnerable to signal error. The problem arises when one individual shows cooperative behavior but the other interprets it as cheating. As a result of this, the second individual now cheats and then it starts a see-saw pattern of cheating in a chain reaction.

==Real-life examples==
The prisoner setting may seem contrived, but there are in fact many examples in human interaction as well as interactions in nature that have the same payoff matrix. The prisoner's dilemma is therefore of interest to the [[social science]]s such as [[economics]], [[politics]], and [[sociology]], as well as to the biological sciences such as [[ethology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. Many natural processes have been abstracted into models in which living beings are engaged in endless games of prisoner's dilemma. This wide applicability of the PD gives the game its substantial importance.

===In environmental studies===
In [[environmental studies]], the PD is evident in crises such as global [[climate change|climate-change]]. It is argued all countries will benefit from a stable climate, but any single country is often hesitant to curb [[Carbon dioxide|{{Co2}}]] emissions. The immediate benefit to any one country from maintaining current behavior is wrongly perceived to be greater than the purported eventual benefit to that country if all countries' behavior was changed, therefore explaining the impasse concerning climate-change in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9867020|title=Markets &amp; Data|date=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important difference between climate-change politics and the prisoner's dilemma is uncertainty; the extent and pace at which pollution can change climate is not known. The dilemma faced by government is therefore different from the prisoner's dilemma in that the payoffs of cooperation are unknown. This difference suggests that states will cooperate much less than in a real iterated prisoner's dilemma, so that the probability of avoiding a possible climate catastrophe is much smaller than that suggested by a game-theoretical analysis of the situation using a real iterated prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rehmeyer|first=Julie|title=Game theory suggests current climate negotiations won't avert catastrophe|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/game-theory-suggests-current-climate-negotiations-won%E2%80%99t-avert-catastrophe|work=Science News|publisher=Society for Science &amp; the Public|date=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osang and Nandy provide a theoretical explanation with proofs for a regulation-driven win-win situation along the
lines of [[Michael Porter]]'s hypothesis, in which government regulation of competing firms is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.smu.edu/tosang/pdf/regln0803.pdf Osang and Nandy 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In animals===
Cooperative behavior of many animals can be understood as an example of the prisoner's dilemma. Often animals engage in long term partnerships, which can be more specifically modeled as iterated prisoner's dilemma. For example, [[guppy|guppies]] inspect predators cooperatively in groups, and they are thought to punish non-cooperative inspectors.

[[Vampire bats]] are social animals that engage in reciprocal food exchange. Applying the payoffs from the prisoner's dilemma can help explain this behavior:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The Selfish Gene|year=1976|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C/C: "Reward: I get blood on my unlucky nights, which saves me from starving. I have to give blood on my lucky nights, which doesn't cost me too much."
* D/C: "Temptation: You save my life on my poor night. But then I get the added benefit of not having to pay the slight cost of feeding you on my good night."
* C/D: "Sucker's Payoff: I pay the cost of saving your life on my good night. But on my bad night you don't feed me and I run a real risk of starving to death."
* D/D: "Punishment: I don't have to pay the slight costs of feeding you on my good nights. But I run a real risk of starving on my poor nights."

===In psychology===
In [[addiction]] research / [[behavioral economics]], [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]] points out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George|last=Ainslie |title=Breakdown of Will |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-59694-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that addiction can be cast as an intertemporal PD problem between the present and future selves of the addict.  In this case, ''defecting'' means ''relapsing'', and it is easy to see that not defecting both today and in the future is by far the best outcome. The case where one abstains today but relapses in the future is the worst outcome&amp;nbsp;– in some sense the discipline and self-sacrifice involved in abstaining today have been "wasted" because the future relapse means that the addict is right back where he started and will have to start over (which is quite demoralizing, and makes starting over more difficult).  Relapsing today and tomorrow is a slightly "better" outcome, because while the addict is still addicted, they haven't put the effort in to trying to stop. The final case, where one engages in the addictive behavior today while abstaining "tomorrow" will be familiar to anyone who has struggled with an addiction.  The problem here is that (as in other PDs) there is an obvious benefit to defecting "today", but tomorrow one will face the same PD, and the same obvious benefit will be present then, ultimately leading to an endless string of defections.

[[John Gottman]] in his research described in "the science of trust" defines good relationships as those where partners know not to enter the (D,D) cell or at least not to get dynamically stuck there in a loop.

===In economics===
Advertising is sometimes cited as a real-example of the prisoner’s dilemma.  When [[cigarette advertising]] was legal in the United States, competing cigarette manufacturers had to decide how much money to spend on advertising.  The effectiveness of Firm A’s advertising was partially determined by the advertising conducted by Firm B.  Likewise, the profit derived from advertising for Firm B is affected by the advertising conducted by Firm A.  If both Firm A and Firm B chose to advertise during a given period, then the advertising cancels out, receipts remain constant, and expenses increase due to the cost of advertising.  Both firms would benefit from a reduction in advertising.  However, should Firm B choose not to advertise, Firm A could benefit greatly by advertising. Nevertheless, the optimal amount of advertising by one firm depends on how much advertising the other undertakes. As the best strategy is dependent on what the other firm chooses there is no dominant strategy, which makes it slightly different from a prisoner's dilemma. The outcome is similar, though, in that both firms would be better off were they to advertise less than in the equilibrium. Sometimes cooperative behaviors do emerge in business situations.  For instance, cigarette manufacturers endorsed the making of laws banning cigarette advertising, understanding that this would reduce costs and increase profits across the industry.{{Citation needed|reason=This reference doesn't mention or support the claimed historical account.|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref name="trust"&gt;This argument for the development of cooperation through trust is given in '' [[The Wisdom of Crowds]] '', where it is argued that long-distance [[capitalism]] was able to form around a nucleus of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], who always dealt honourably with their business partners. (Rather than defecting and reneging on promises&amp;nbsp;– a phenomenon that had discouraged earlier long-term unenforceable overseas contracts). It is argued that dealings with reliable merchants allowed the [[meme]] for cooperation to spread to other traders, who spread it further until a high degree of cooperation became a profitable strategy in general [[commerce]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This analysis is likely to be pertinent in many other business situations involving advertising.{{Citation needed|reason=This doesn't sound like cooperation|date=November 2012}}

Without enforceable agreements, members of a [[cartel]] are also involved in a (multi-player) prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref name=NicholsonIntermediateMicroEd8&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Nicholson|year=2000|title=Intermediate Microeconomics|edition=8th|publisher=Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Cooperating' typically means keeping prices at a pre-agreed minimum level. 'Defecting' means selling under this minimum level, instantly taking business (and profits) from other cartel members. [[Anti-trust]] authorities want potential cartel members to mutually defect, ensuring the lowest possible prices for [[consumer]]s.

===In sport===
[[Doping in sport]] has been cited as an example of a prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneier |first=Bruce |url=https://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/10/lance-armstrong-and-the-prisoners-dilemma-of-doping-in-professional-sports/ |title=Lance Armstrong and the Prisoners' Dilemma of Doping in Professional Sports &amp;#124; Wired Opinion |publisher=Wired.com |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two competing athletes have the option to use an illegal and/or dangerous drug to boost their performance. If neither athlete takes the drug, then neither gains an advantage. If only one does, then that athlete gains a significant advantage over their competitor, reduced by the legal and/or medical dangers of having taken the drug. If both athletes take the drug, however, the benefits cancel out and only the dangers remain, putting them both in a worse position than if neither had used doping.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

===In international politics===
In [[international politics|international political theory]], the Prisoner's Dilemma is often used to demonstrate the coherence of [[strategic realism]], which holds that in international relations, all states (regardless of their internal policies or professed ideology), will act in their rational self-interest given [[anarchy (international relations)|international anarchy]]. A classic example is an arms race like the [[Cold War]] and similar conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165489684900222 | title = Arms races as iterated prisoner's dilemma games | author = Stephen J. Majeski | journal = Mathematical and Social Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–66 | year = 1984 | doi=10.1016/0165-4896(84)90022-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cold War the opposing alliances of [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] both had the choice to arm or disarm. From each side's point of view, disarming whilst their opponent continued to arm would have led to military inferiority and possible annihilation. Conversely, arming whilst their opponent disarmed would have led to superiority. If both sides chose to arm, neither could afford to attack the other, but both incurred the high cost of developing and maintaining a nuclear arsenal. If both sides chose to disarm, war would be avoided and there would be no costs.

Although the 'best' overall outcome is for both sides to disarm, the rational course for both sides is to arm, and this is indeed what happened. Both sides poured enormous resources into military research and armament in a [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]] for the next thirty years until the Soviet Union could not withstand the economic cost.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The same logic could be applied in any similar scenario, be it economic or technological competition between sovereign states.

===Multiplayer dilemmas===
Many real-life dilemmas involve multiple players.&lt;ref&gt;Gokhale CS, Traulsen A. Evolutionary games in the multiverse. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 2010 Mar 23. 107(12):5500–04.&lt;/ref&gt; Although metaphorical, [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin's]] [[tragedy of the commons]] may be viewed as an example of a multi-player generalization of the PD: Each villager makes a choice for personal gain or restraint. The collective reward for unanimous (or even frequent) defection is very low payoffs (representing the destruction of the "commons"). A commons dilemma most people can relate to is washing the dishes in a shared house.  By not washing dishes an individual can gain by saving his time, but if that behavior is adopted by every resident the collective cost is no clean plates for anyone.

The commons are not always exploited: [[William Poundstone]], in a book about the prisoner's dilemma (see References below), describes a situation in New Zealand where newspaper boxes are left unlocked. It is possible for people to [[Excludability|take a paper without paying]] (''defecting'') but very few do, feeling that if they do not pay then neither will others, destroying the system. Subsequent research by [[Elinor Ostrom]], winner of the 2009 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, hypothesized that the [[tragedy of the commons]] is oversimplified, with the negative outcome influenced by outside influences. Without complicating pressures, groups communicate and manage the commons among themselves for their mutual benefit, enforcing social norms to preserve the resource and achieve the maximum good for the group, an example of effecting the best case outcome for PD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/2009/10/12/elinor-ostrom-and-the-tragedy-of-the-commons/ |title=The Volokh Conspiracy " Elinor Ostrom and the Tragedy of the Commons |publisher=Volokh.com |date=2009-10-12 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closed-bag exchange===

[[Douglas Hofstadter]]&lt;ref name="dh"&gt;{{cite book | first=Douglas R. | last=Hofstadter| authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter | title= [[Metamagical Themas]]: questing for the essence of mind and pattern | publisher= Bantam Dell Pub Group| year=1985 | isbn=0-465-04566-9|chapter= Ch.29 ''The Prisoner's Dilemma Computer Tournaments and the Evolution of Cooperation''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; once suggested that people often find problems such as the PD problem easier to understand when it is illustrated in the form of a simple game, or trade-off. One of several examples he used was "closed bag exchange":
{{quote|Two people meet and exchange closed bags, with the understanding that one of them contains money, and the other contains a purchase. Either player can choose to honor the deal by putting into his or her bag what he or she agreed, or he or she can defect by handing over an empty bag.}}

In this game, defection always gives a game-theoretically preferable outcome.

===''Friend or Foe?''===
''[[Friend or Foe? (TV series)|Friend or Foe?]]'' is a game show that aired from 2002 to 2005 on the [[Game Show Network]] in the US.  It is an example of the prisoner's dilemma game tested on real people, but in an artificial setting. On the game show, three pairs of people compete. When a pair is eliminated, they play a game similar to the prisoner's dilemma to determine how the winnings are split. If they both cooperate (Friend), they share the winnings 50–50. If one cooperates and the other defects (Foe), the defector gets all the winnings and the cooperator gets nothing. If both defect, both leave with nothing. Notice that the reward matrix is slightly different from the standard one given above, as the rewards for the "both defect" and the "cooperate while the opponent defects" cases are identical. This makes the "both defect" case a weak equilibrium, compared with being a strict equilibrium in the standard prisoner's dilemma. If a contestant knows that their opponent is going to vote "Foe", then their own choice does not affect their own winnings. In a specific sense, ''Friend or Foe'' has a rewards model between prisoner's dilemma and the [[Chicken (game)|game of Chicken]].

This payoff matrix has also been used on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] programmes ''Trust Me'', ''[[Shafted]]'', ''[[The Bank Job (TV series)|The Bank Job]]'' and ''[[Golden Balls]]'', and on the [[United States|American]] shows ''[[Bachelor Pad]]'' and ''[[Take It All (game show)|Take It All]]''. Game data from the ''[[Golden Balls]]'' series has been analyzed by a team of economists, who found that cooperation was "surprisingly high" for amounts of money that would seem consequential in the real world, but were comparatively low in the context of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ssrn=1592456 | title=Split or Steal?

===Iterated snowdrift===
Researchers from the [[University of Lausanne]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]] have suggested that the "Iterated Snowdrift Game" may more closely reflect real-world social situations. Although this model is actually a [[chicken game]], it will be described here. In this model, the risk of being exploited through defection is lower, and individuals always gain from taking the cooperative choice. The snowdrift game imagines two drivers who are stuck on opposite sides of a [[snowdrift]], each of whom is given the option of shoveling snow to clear a path, or remaining in their car. A player's highest payoff comes from leaving the opponent to clear all the snow by themselves, but the opponent is still nominally rewarded for their work.

This may better reflect real world scenarios, the researchers giving the example of two scientists collaborating on a report, both of whom would benefit if the other worked harder. "But when your collaborator doesn’t do any work, it’s probably better for you to do all the work yourself. You’ll still end up with a completed project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kümmerli|first=Rolf|title='Snowdrift' game tops 'Prisoner's Dilemma' in explaining cooperation|url=http://phys.org/news111145481.html|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==

Several software packages have been created to run prisoner's dilemma simulations and tournaments, some of which have available source code.

==In fiction==
[[Hannu Rajaniemi]] set the opening scene of his ''[[The Quantum Thief]]'' trilogy in a "dilemma prison". The main theme of the series has been described as the "inadequacy of a binary universe" and the ultimate antagonist is a character called the All-Defector.  Rajaniemi is particularly interesting as an artist treating this subject in that he is a Cambridge-trained mathematician and holds a PhD in [[mathematical physics]]&amp;nbsp;– the interchangeability of matter and information is a major feature of the books, which take place in a "post-singularity" future.  The first book in the series was published in 2010, with the two sequels, ''[[The Fractal Prince]]'' and ''[[The Causal Angel]]'', published in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

A game modeled after the (iterated) prisoner's dilemma is a central focus of the 2012 video game ''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]'' and a minor part in its 2016 sequel ''[[Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma]]''.

In ''The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma'' by [[Trenton Lee Stewart]], the main characters start by playing a version of the game and escaping from the "prison" altogether. Later they become actual prisoners and escape once again.

[[Image:Flight West EMB-120.jpg|thumb|[[Flight West]] was a regional airline operating in [[Australia]] in the 1990s]]
'''Regional airlines''' are [[airline]]s that operate [[regional airliner|regional aircraft]] to provide passenger air service to communities without sufficient demand to attract [[Mainline (flight)|mainline]] service. There are two main ways for a regional airline to do business:
# As an '''affiliated airline''', contracting with a [[Major carrier|major airline]], operating under their brand name, and filling two roles: delivering passengers to the major airline's hubs from surrounding communities, known as ''regional feeds'', and increasing frequency of service on mainline routes during times when demand does not warrant use of large aircraft, known as ''commuter flights''.
# Operating as an '''independent airline''' under their own brand, mostly providing service to small and isolated communities, for whom the airline is the only reasonable link to a larger town. Examples of this are [[PenAir]], which links the remote [[Aleutian Islands]] to [[Anchorage, Alaska]], and [[Mokulele Airlines]], which operates in the Hawaiian islands.

Small regional airlines operating in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s were also known as '''commuter airlines''' and were classified as such in the [[Official Airline Guide]] (OAG).

==History==
[[Image:easternairways j41 g-majx arp.jpg|thumb|left|[[BAe Jetstream 41|British Aerospace Jetstream 41]] of the UK regional airline [[Eastern Airways]]]]
Regional airlines began by operating propeller-driven aircraft over short routes, sometimes on flights of less than 100 miles. In the early days of commercial aviation few aircraft had ranges greater than this, and airlines were often formed to serve the area in which they formed. That is, there was no strong distinction between a regional airline and any other airline. This changed with the introduction of long-range aircraft, which led to the development of the flag carrier airlines, such as [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] and [[Trans-Canada Airlines]]. As the flag carriers grew in importance with increasing long-range passenger traffic, the smaller airlines found a niche flying passengers over short routes to the flag carrier's airport. This arrangement was eventually formalized, forming the regional airlines.

Through the 1960s and 1970s, war surplus designs, notably the [[DC-3]], were replaced by much more capable [[turboprop]] or [[Jet aircraft|jet]]-powered designs like the [[Fokker F27 Friendship]] or [[BAC One-Eleven]]. This extended the range of the regionals dramatically, causing a wave of consolidations between the now overlapping airlines.

In the United States, regional airlines were an important building block of today's passenger air system.  The U.S. Government encouraged the forming of regional airlines to provide services from smaller communities to larger towns, where air passengers could connect to a larger network.

Some of the original regional airlines (then known as "'''Local Service Airlines'''") sanctioned by the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] in the 1940s and 1950s include:

{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
* [[Allegheny Airlines]]
* [[Bonanza Air Lines]]
* [[Central Airlines]]
* [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier Airlines]]
* [[Lake Central Airlines]]
* [[Mohawk Airlines]]
* [[North Central Airlines]]
* [[Ozark Airlines]]
* [[Pacific Air Lines]]
* [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]]
* [[Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989)|Piedmont Airlines]]
* [[Southern Airways]]
* [[Southwest Airways]] (renamed Pacific Air Lines in 1958)
* [[Trans-Texas Airways]]
* [[West Coast Airlines]]
{{div col end}}

None of these airlines survive today; some airlines use these names today but are not the direct successors to the original airlines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} A history and study of regional airlines was published by the Smithsonian Institution Press in 1994 under the title ''Commuter Airlines of the United States'', by [[R.E.G. Davies]] and [[I. E. Quastler]].

One of the first independently owned and managed airlines in the world that rebranded its aircraft to match a larger airline's brand was [[Air Alpes]] of France. During 1974, Air Alpes painted its newly delivered short range regional jets in the livery of [[Air France]].
[[File:Fokker F27-300 PH-KFA NLM GRON 13.03.67 edited-3.jpg|thumb|NLM [[Fokker F.27|Fokker F.27 Friendship]] wearing the basic mainline livery of [[KLM Airlines]] however wearing the initial titles of NLM at Groningen in 1967. [[NLM Cityhopper|NLM]] was set up as a KLM subsidiary from its founding and later evolved into [[KLM Cityhopper]].  In 1976 [[flight attendant|Cabin Staff]] contractually won opportunity to be considered for KLM employment after a set period of commitment to NLM.]]

[[Image:SN601 Corvette F-BVPE Alsace BRU 12.09.77 edited-3.jpg|thumb|An Aerospatiale Corvette of [[Air Alsace]] at Brussels Airport in 1977. Much like Air Alpes, these aircraft fed regional and higher yielding traffic to Air France and were also one of the first companies to adopt the now common practice of taking on the branding livery of a much large company, namely Air France; who they operated in association with.]] [[NLM Cityhopper|NLM]]'s KLM style branding does however pre-date the Air France efforts though by a number of years.
&lt;ref&gt;http://library.fes.de/itf/pdf/z2776/1976/z2776_1976_12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the "rebranding" or "pseudo branding" of a much smaller airline into the name recognition of a much larger one soon became clear as passenger numbers soared at Air Alpes, and it was soon decided to paint other aircraft such as the [[Fokker F-27]] into full Air France colours as well.

Since the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] of 1978, the US federal government has continued support of the regional airline sector to ensure many of the smaller and more isolated [[rural]] communities remain connected to air services. This is encouraged with the [[Essential Air Service]] program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dot.gov/policy/aviation-policy/small-community-rural-air-service/essential-air-service "Essential Air Service"]. ''U.S. Department of Transportation''. Office of Aviation Policy. DOT. Tuesday, April 29, 2014. Retrieved Thursday, July 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; that subsidizes airline service to smaller U.S. [[community|communities]] and [[suburban]] centers, aiming to maintain year-round service.

Although regional airlines in the United States are often viewed as small, not particularly lucrative "no name" subsidiaries of the mainline airlines, in terms of revenue, many would be designated [[major carrier|major airline carrier]] status based on the only actual definition of "major airline," in the United States, the definition from the U.S. Department of Transportation. This definition is based solely on annual revenue and not on any other criterion such as average aircraft seating capacity, pilot pay, or number of aircraft in the fleet. It is common in the U.S. to incorrectly associate aircraft size with the Department of Transportation's designation of major, national, and regional airline. The only corollary is the Regional Airline Association, an industry trade group, defines "regional airlines" generally as "...operat(ing) short and medium haul scheduled airline service connecting smaller communities with larger cities and connecting hubs. The airlines' fleet primarily consists of 19 to 68 seat turboprops and 30 to 100 seat regional jets." To be clear there is no distinction in the Department of Transportation definition of major, national and regional airlines by aircraft size. The definition is based on revenue. The clash of definitions has led to confusion in the media and the public.

Beginning around 1985, a number of trends have become apparent. Regional aircraft are getting larger, faster, and are flying longer ranges. Additionally, the vast majority of regionals within the United States with more than ten aircraft within their fleet, have lost their individual identities and now serve only as feeders, to [[Alaska Airlines]],  [[American Airlines]],  [[Delta Air Lines]], or [[United Airlines]] major hubs. Regional  aircraft in the US have been getting slightly more comfortable with the addition of better [[ergonomics|ergonomically]] designed [[aircraft cabin]]s, and the addition of varying [[travel class]]es aboard these aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  From small, less than 50-seat "single-class cabin" [[turboprop]], to [[turbofan]] [[Regional airliner#Regional jets|regional jet]] equipment, present day regional airlines provide [[aircraft]] such as the higher capacity [[Bombardier CRJ700|CRJ700]], [[Bombardier CRJ700|CRJ900]], [[Bombardier CRJ700|CRJ1000]] series of aircraft and the somewhat larger fuselage [[Embraer E-Jets]].  Some of these newer aircraft are capable of flying longer distances with comfort levels that rival and surpass the regional airline equipment of the past.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In the early 1990s, much more advanced turboprop-powered, fuel efficient, and passenger friendly [[DC-3]] type replacement projects such as the 19 passenger [[Embraer/FMA CBA 123 Vector]] and the 34 seat [[Dornier 328]] were undertaken, but met little financial success, partly due to economic downturn in the airline industry resulting from the outbreak of hostilities when [[Iraq invasion of Kuwait|Iraq invaded Kuwait]]. Many of the regional airlines  operating turboprop equipment such as [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]]'s regional sister [[Comair]] airlines in the United States set the course for bypassing entirely the regional turboprops as they became the first to transition to an all-jet [[Regional jet#Regional jets|regional jet]] fleet.  To a lesser extent in Europe and the United Kingdom this transition, to  notably the [[Embraer]] or [[Canadair]] designs, was well advanced by the late  1990s. This evolution towards jet equipment, brought the independent regional airlines into direct competition with the major airlines, forcing additional consolidation.

To improve on their market penetration, larger airline [[holding company|holding companies]] rely on operators of smaller aircraft to provide service or added frequency service to some airports. Such airlines, often operating in [[code-share]] arrangements with mainline airlines, often completely repaint [http://www.eturbonews.com/7932/commuter-airlines-bring-anxiety-business-travelers] their aircraft fleet in the mainline airline's sub-brand livery.  For example, [[United Express]] regional airline partner [[CommutAir]] branded its entire fleet as United Express.  On the other hand, regional airline [[Gulfstream International Airlines]] does not brand their aircraft. When [[Colgan Air]] was still operating, they branded a handful of aircraft as Colgan Air, but most were branded as [[Continental Connection]], [[US Airways Express]] or [[United Express]], with whom it had contractual agreements.

[[Image:Corporate5966.JPG|thumb|Typical seat map of a smaller [[regional airliner]] as is often flown by the regional airlines. The smallest aircraft flown under such brands and regional airlines may or may not have [[aircraft lavatory|lavatories]].]]

Many airline passengers find sub-branding very confusing, while many other airline passengers are content to think they are on a mainline or flagship airline's aircraft, while in actuality they are far from it. Sub-branding is pretty consistent throughout the airline industry of the United States, with all the regional airlines, mainline airlines, and the regional airline holding companies, as well as the mainline airlines holding companies participating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Frontline: Flying Cheap|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/flyingcheap/interviews/cohen.html#1|accessdate=1 June 2012|newspaper=Public Broadcasting Service|date=Feb 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former regional airlines===
Post airline deregulation, airlines sought added market share and to do this they sought partnerships with regional and small airlines to feed traffic into the airline hub.

Initially these tie ups tended to use small 15 -19 seat aircraft, which did not have a reputation of passenger comfort, or safe reliable operations, by small often under capitalized tiny airline operators.

To create a common tie and what appeared to be seamless to the air traveler, major carriers marketed in advertising and soon had much smaller airlines paint their small and what was often described as puddle-jumper aircraft, in the image and branding colors of the much larger mainline partner. This was to give the appearance of reliability. Over time these regional aircraft grew in size as airline hubs expanded and competition dwindled among the major carriers.

Below is a list of many of the regional brands that evolved when regional airlines were advertised to look like the major airlines.

==Current regional airlines==

===North America===
{{update|section|date=May 2014}}
In [[North America]] many of the largest regional airlines have joined the lobbying group [[Regional Airline Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members in the Regional Airline Assoc.|url=http://www.raa.org/AirlineMembers/tabid/65/Default.aspx|publisher=RAA|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510171307/http://www.raa.org/AirlineMembers/tabid/65/Default.aspx|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association lobbies purely for the financial interest of the corporate bodies it constitutes, not the employees of those airlines.

Many large airlines, especially in North America, have established operational relationships with one or more regional airline companies. Their aircraft often use the [[aircraft livery]] for the company they are operating flights for.  These airlines can be [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]] of the major airline or fly under a [[code sharing]] agreement or operating through capacity purchase agreements, with the mainline parent company financing the aircraft for the regional airline, and then placing the aircraft with the regional for very little cost. An example would be [[Envoy Air]], which is fully owned by [[American Airlines Group]] and does business as [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]].

For all practical purposes, regional airlines in the United States today, are nothing more than co-branded '''feeder airlines''' to U.S. [[airline alliance]] largest airports and [[major jet airline]]s chief [[focus city|focus cities]] / airline hubs; possessing very few independent routes truly operated independently and apart from those described.

==== Canada ====
In Canada, there are a number of regional airlines. Some of them focus on [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]] and [[First Nations]] communities, while others operate regional flights on behalf of a larger carrier, similar to their American counterparts. Some of these airlines and brands include:
* [[Air Canada Express]] operated by:
** [[Air Georgian]]
** [[Exploits Valley Air Services]]
** [[Jazz (airline)|Jazz]]
** [[Sky Regional Airlines]]
* [[Air Creebec]]
* [[Air Tindi]]
* [[Bearskin Airlines]]
* [[Canadian North]]
* [[Pacific Coastal Airlines]]
* [[Pascan Aviation]]
* [[Perimeter Aviation]]
* [[Porter Airlines]]
* [[Wasaya Airways]]
* [[WestJet Encore]] (operating for [[WestJet]])

==== United States ====
The trend of branding smaller and mostly regional (in terms of geographical scope) airlines to match the mainline airlines, has led to only three main sub-brands in the United States. These three, [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]], [[Delta Connection]], and [[United Express]] are the post-deregulation survivors resultant of the multiple bankruptcies and mergers of the major, legacy, [[mainline (flight)|mainline]] airlines, as well as some discount or low-cost carriers which adopted similar strategic marketing ideas.

=====Regional airline holding companies=====
Many small regional airlines have grown substantially, usually through virtual mergers by use of the regional airline holding company, as pioneered by [[AMR Corporation]] in 1982. AMR created the AMR Eagle Holding Corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hoovers.com/american-eagle/--ID__104090--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml |title= AMR Eagle Holding Corporation |accessdate=2007-10-01 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which unified its wholly owned [[Envoy Air|American Eagle Airlines]] and [[Executive Airlines]] under one division, but still maintained the regional airlines' [[operating certificate]]s and personnel separate from each other and [[American Airlines]].

In the United States, the most significant airline holding companies, and their subsidiary regional airlines, are:
* [[Alaska Air Group]]
** [[Horizon Air]]
* [[American Airlines Group]]
** [[Envoy Air]]
** [[Piedmont Airlines]]
** [[PSA Airlines]]
* [[HoTH Inc.]]
** [[Era Aviation|Corvus Airlines]]
** [[Frontier Flying Services]]
** [[Hageland Aviation]]
* [[Republic Airways Holdings]]
** [[Republic Airlines]]
* [[SkyWest, Inc.]]
** [[SkyWest Airlines]]
** [[ExpressJet Airlines]]
* [[Trans States Holdings]]
** [[Compass Airlines (North America)|Compass Airlines]]
** [[GoJet Airlines|GoJet]]
** [[Trans States Airlines]]
* [[Mesa Air Group]]
** [[Mesa Airlines]]
* [[Delta Air Lines]]
** [[Endeavor Air]]

=====Regional brands=====
As of August 2018, the various holding companies support the dwindling number of regional brands:
* [[Alaska Air Group|Alaska Horizon/Alaska SkyWest]]
* [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]]
* [[Delta Connection]]
* [[Hawaiian Airlines|Ohana by Hawaiian]]
* [[Ravn Alaska|Ravn Connect]]
* [[United Express]]

These [[virtual airline (economics)|virtual airlines]], as they have been called, tend to use largely outsourced labor at most stations, to reduce costs. In 2011, 61% of all advertised flights for American, Delta, United and US Airways were operated by their regional brands. This figure was only 40% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/mcgee/2014/09/24/airplane-reclining-seat-pitch-width/16105491/&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Smaller commuter airlines=====
The evolution and chronological history of the commuter side of the regional airline industry can be defined by a number of dates prior to the end of the era of airline regulation by the '''Civil Aeronautics Board''' of the United States.  Among these significant dates are:

: '''1967''' – CAB makes exemption for airlines, starting with the local service carrier '''Allegheny Airlines'''; to suspend operating a route with [[large aircraft]] due to a lack of passenger traffic to do so profitably, provided the airline operating the CAB awarded route substitutes its operation with other equipment and maintains responsibility the route is served.  As such this "exemption" allowed the development of the '''Allegheny Commuter System''' and the subcontracting of [[Henson Airlines]] to fulfill Allegheny's CAB route award obligations.&lt;ref&gt;http://cf.alpa.org/mec/aaa/docs/newmectoday/arc/airwaves/aw9909/rj999.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
: '''1969 and before''' – aircraft falling below the weight of 12,500 lbs were considered small aircraft and thus, not subject to the certification requirements of the CAB.
: '''1969 and after''' – the CAB officially defined airlines with aircraft of no more than 12,500 pounds of maximum gross weight as commuter airlines
: '''1972''' – relaxations of the CAB regulations permitted commuter aircraft to carry 30 passengers and a payload of 7,500 pounds.
: '''1977''' – Official list of U.S. Commuter Airlines in the year prior to airline deregulation
: '''1978''' – during the sunset of the CAB regulation the size of commuters were permitted to grow to 60 passengers and 18,000 pounds of freight.
: '''1978 and onwards''' the airline industry was officially deregulated by the [[Airline Deregulation Act of 1978]]
: '''1981''' – the United States governmental lobbying body of this industry, known as the '''Commuter Airline Association,''' changes its name to the '''Regional Airline Association'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1119&amp;context=hospitalityreview&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the lesser known smaller brands used by the regional airlines and their [[parent companies]] were:
* PWExpress, a regional airline brand of the regional airline named [[Pacific Wings]], IATA code (LW) which is owned by Pacific Air Holdings company
* New Mexico Airlines, a regional airline brand of Pacific Wings, which is owned by Pacific Air Holdings company
[[Image:Cape Air.JPG|thumb|Cessna 402C of '''Hyannis Air Service''' – Cape Air]]
* [[Nantucket Airlines]], a brand operated by regional airline [[Cape Air]] which is wholly owned by the regional airline holding company '''Hyannis Air Service.'''
* '''Ravn Connect''', a commuter /air taxi brand operated by the regional airlines owned by the HoTH parent company in association with [[Era Aviation|Corvus Airlines]] which operates under the [[Ravn Alaska]] marketing brand and is also owned by  HoTH.

=== Europe ===
[[Image:air france cityjet ei-dmk.arp.jpg|thumb|[[CityJet]] is a European regional airline operating services on behalf of [[Air France]]. This is a [[Bae 146|British Aerospace 146-200]].]]
European regional airlines serve the intra-continental sector in [[Europe]].  They connect cities to major airports and to other cities, avoiding the need for passengers to make transfers.

For example, [[BA CityFlyer]] a regional subsidiary of British Airways uses the basic [[British Airways ethnic liveries|''Chatham Dockyard Union Flag'' livery]] of its [[parent company]] and flies between domestic and European cities. In a slightly different category [[ExpressJet Airlines]] another regional carrier, but one which is independently owned and managed, although its 205 aircraft fleet operates in the marketing [[brand]] of [[Continental Airlines|Continental Airlines, Inc.]], [[Continental Express]]. In these roles, all of the preceding airlines are operated primarily to bring passengers to the major hubs, where they will connect for longer distance flights on the [[national airline]]s also known as [[flag carrier|flagship carriers]]'s, larger aircraft. The smallest regional carriers have become known as feeder airlines. The separate corporate structure allows the company to operate under different pay schedules, typically paying much less than their [[mainline (flight)|mainline]] owners.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Some of Europe's regional airlines are subsidiaries of national air carriers, though there remains a strong [[entrepreneur]]ial sector of independents. They are based on business models ranging from the traditional full service airline to [[low cost airline|low cost carriers]]. Innovations include one where the passenger is required to join a membership club before being allowed to fly.

Some examples of European regional airlines include:
{{see also|List of regional airlines#Europe}}
* [[Air Nostrum]]
* [[Air Southwest]]
* [[Aer Arann]]
* [[Alitalia CityLiner]]
* [[Aurigny Air Services]]
* [[Blue Islands]]

=== Asia ===
;India
India has many regional carriers operating currently. Some of these operate under the government's [[UDAN|UDAN (Regional Connectivity Scheme)]].

* [[Alliance Air (India)|Alliance Air]], a subsidiary of India's state-owned flag carrier, [[Air India]].
* [[Air Deccan]] 
* [[Air Odisha]]
* [[Air Carnival]]
* [[Air Costa]]
* [[Air Pegasus]]
* [[TruJet]]
;Singapore
[[SilkAir]] is the regional wing of [[Singapore Airlines]] and operates scheduled passenger services from [[Singapore]] to 37 cities in the region of Southeast Asia, South Asia and China. This airline differs from airlines in [[North America]] and [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]] in that it uses "[[mainline (flight)|mainline]] sized equipment" that is aircraft with a seating capacity greater than 99 passengers, but uniquely receives the designation of a "regional airline" [[subsidiary]] by its aforementioned airline [[parent company]].
;Thailand
*[[Bangkok Airways]] has won World's Best Regional Airline from Skytrax three years in a row in 2015, 2016 and 2017

=== Australia ===
[[Regional Express Airlines]] is the largest regional airline outside of the [[Qantas]] group in [[Australia]], servicing routes in several [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]]. The regional arms of Qantas is known as [[QantasLink]].

==Pay issues==
[[File:Regional Pilot First Year Pay II.jpg|thumb|left|First year regional pilot pay as of Aug. 2011. Source: AirlinePilotCentral.com, an industry career site.]]In the film, ''[[Capitalism: A Love Story]]'', director and film producer [[Michael Moore]] profiled how little most regional pilots are paid in the first few years of their careers. Hourly wages for regional pilots start at $12.50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avjobs.com/salaries-wages-pay/pilot-pay.asp  | title=avjobs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, a cabbie in New York averages $17 an hour, according to the city's Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,520097,00.html | title=Low Pay One of Many Difficulties Facing Regional Pilots: Fox News | date=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Feb 12th, 2010, a year after the crash of [[Colgan flight 3407]], ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' premiered its WGA Award-winning exposé on the industry entitled "Flying Cheap". In the program, reporter [[Miles O'Brien (journalist)|Miles O'Brien]] questioned how the impact of low salaries are having on pilot psyches and how safe this could be for the flying public. When asked to respond to the question, Roger Cohen, president of the Regional Airline Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raa.org/RAAHome/RAAStaff/tabid/72/Default.aspx |title=RAA.com, Staff |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302004712/https://www.raa.org/RAAHome/RAAStaff/tabid/72/Default.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; told ''Frontline'' that, "...there are many other people who earn less money than that and work more days in these communities that can afford it and do it and do it responsibly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/flyingcheap/interviews/cohen.html | title=Frontline: Flying Cheap, Cohen interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
An alternative to some regional airline service may be the new [[Small Aircraft Transportation System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ncam-sats.org/Oshkosh07-NCAM.htm |title= SATS &amp; NCAM members continues to develop at Oshkosh AirVenture 2007 |accessdate= 2007-10-01 |work=  |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011053552/http://ncam-sats.org/Oshkosh07-NCAM.htm |archivedate= 2007-10-11 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; initiative in conjunction with [[general aviation]] and [[VLJ]]s (very light jets). With the introduction of [[air taxi]] [[VLJ]]s, city pair links to smaller communities lacking regional connections could become more common.

In many regions, regional airlines increasingly face competition from [[high-speed rail]] with airlines sometimes replacing feeder services through [[air rail alliances]].

'''Robert C. Balling, Jr.''' is a [[professor]] of geography at [[Arizona State University]], and the former director of its Office of [[Climatology]]. His research interests include [[climatology]], global [[climate change]], and [[geographic information systems]].&lt;ref name=ASU&gt;[http://geoplan.asu.edu/balling/ Professor Robert C. Balling, Jr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007230047/http://geoplan.asu.edu/balling |date=2013-10-07 }} at [[Arizona State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Balling has declared himself one of the scientists who [[List of scientists opposing global warming consensus|oppose]] the consensus on global warming, arguing in a 2009 book that anthropogenic global warming "is indeed real, but relatively modest",&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Michaels]] and Robert C. Balling, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lWQdP4_7SycC Climate of extremes: global warming science they don't want you to know]'', [[Cato Institute]], 2009. p7&lt;/ref&gt; and maintaining that there is a [[publication bias]] in the scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;Michaels and Balling (2009:10)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Balling was born and raised in [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]], and moved to [[Springfield, Ohio]] in 1970 to attend [[Wittenberg University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asufiji.org/2012/balling-professor-year/ |title=Fiji Climatologist Named ASU Professor of Year |date=5 May 2012 |publisher=[[Phi Gamma Delta]] at [[Arizona State University]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106181951/http://www.asufiji.org/2012/balling-professor-year/ |archive-date=6 January 2016 |access-date=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he decided to join [[Phi Gamma Delta]] after hearing good things about it and because many of his friends were pledging it. Balling gained bachelor's and master's degrees in [[geography]] in 1974 ([[Wittenberg University]], BA) and 1975 ([[Bowling Green State University]], MA), before gaining his [[Ph.D.]] in geography from the [[University of Oklahoma]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=ASU/&gt; He was assistant professor at the [[University of Nebraska]] (1979–1984), before joining the Office of Climatology at [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref name=ASU/&gt; He gained [[tenure]] there in 1987, and served as the director of the Office of Climatology until 2004.&lt;ref name=ASU/&gt;

==Research==
Balling has published much research pertaining to various factors that influence the Earth's climate. In 1988, Balling published a study which found that the construction of [[golf course]]s around [[Palm Springs, CA]] may have cooled the city over the preceding 15 years, in contrast to the warming effect usually associated with urban areas (also known as the [[urban heat island]] effect).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/13/science/new-factor-affecting-climate-the-golf-course-effect.html | title=New Factor Affecting Climate: The Golf-Course Effect | work=[[New York Times]] | date=13 September 1988 | accessdate=16 March 2014 | author=Wilford, John Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years later, Balling and Randall S. Cerveny, one of his ASU colleagues, published a study which found that the moon, when it is [[Full moon|full]], can cause Earth's troposphere to warm by more than 0.03&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balling|first=R. C.|author2=Cerveny, R. S. |title=Influence of Lunar Phase on Daily Global Temperatures|journal=Science|date=10 March 1995|volume=267|issue=5203|pages=1481–1483|doi=10.1126/science.267.5203.1481|pmid=17743548|bibcode=1995Sci...267.1481B}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it remained unclear why the moon might be able to do this. When interviewed by the New York Times, Balling suggested the main reason might be that [[infrared radiation]] from the Sun is reflected towards Earth by the full moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/10/us/surprising-scientists-full-moon-is-found-to-play-role-in-warming-the-earth.html | title=Surprising Scientists, Full Moon Is Found to Play Role in Warming the Earth | work=New York Times | date=10 March 1995 | accessdate=16 March 2014 | author=Browne, Malcolm W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Balling and Cerveny published a letter to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' which found that man-made air pollutants, especially [[ozone]] and [[carbon monoxide]], were influencing weather patterns on the East Coast of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cerveny|first=Randall S.|author2=Balling, Robert C. |title=Weekly cycles of air pollutants, precipitation and tropical cyclones in the coastal NW Atlantic region|journal=Nature|date=6 August 1998|volume=394|issue=6693|pages=561–563|doi=10.1038/29043|bibcode=1998Natur.394..561C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/06/local/me-10576 | title=Weekday Pollution Linked to Pattern of Rainy Weekends on East Coast | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=6 August 1998 | accessdate=16 March 2014 | author=Maugh, Thomas H. II}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study also concluded that this effect was the strongest on Saturdays, and that this was so because "...the end of the week brings worse air pollution than the beginning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/170974 | title=Saturday-night showers | work=[[The Economist]] | date=6 August 1998 | accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding controversy==
Balling was mentioned as a fossil fuel industry – funded scientist in [[Ross Gelbspan]]'s 1997 book ''The Heat is On''. This led the Minnesota ''[[Star Tribune]]'' to run an editorial speaking of a "disinformation campaign" by some climatologists. Balling and his colleague [[Patrick Michaels]] took a complaint against the Star Tribune to the Minnesota News Council. By a 9–4 decision the council "voted to sustain the complaint that the Star Tribune editorial unfairly characterized the scientific reputations of Patrick Michaels and Robert Balling."&lt;ref name=MNC/&gt; At the 1998 hearing, Balling "acknowledged that he had received $408,000 in research funding from the fossil fuel industry over the last decade (of which his University takes 50% for overhead)."&lt;ref name=MNC&gt;Minnesota News Council, 16 April 1998, [http://news-council.org/1998/04/16/determination-118-patrick-michaels-robert-balling-v-star-tribune/ Determination 118: Patrick Michaels, Robert Balling v.

WFA founded the group in 1997, according to an archived version of its website, "as a vehicle for advocacy on climate change, the environmental impact of CO2, and fossil fuel use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greeningearthsociety.org/join.html |title="Join GES" |accessdate=2005-03-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308200600/http://www.greeningearthsociety.org/join.html |archivedate=March 8, 2005 |df= }}, Greening Earth Society website.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, while it was directed by Balling, ASU's office of climatology received $49,000 from [[ExxonMobil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2005/05/put-tiger-your-think-tank | title=Put a Tiger In Your Think Tank | work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | date=May–June 2005 | accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1989 to 2002, Balling received more than $679,000 from fossil-fuel-industry organizations; as of 2007, he also had received more than $7 million in research funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[EPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/1111balling1111.html | title=Outspoken ASU prof draws ire | work=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=11 November 2007 | accessdate=14 March 2014 | author=Purtill, Corinne}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also come under scrutiny because he was listed as a tentative author of [[the Heartland Institute]]'s [[NIPCC]] report; however, ASU's vice president of public affairs, Virgil Renzulli, pointed out that this did not imply that Balling had been receiving money from Heartland. Balling himself added that his prior involvement with the Heartland Institute's activities amounted only to appearing at a luncheon they held in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statepress.com/2012/03/04/professor-accused-of-bias-in-environmental-research/ | title=Professor accused of bias in environmental research | work=[[State Press]] | date=4 March 2012 | accessdate=14 March 2014 | author=Peirano, Michelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 2015, Arizona State Representative [[Raúl Grijalva]] wrote letters to seven universities where climate skeptic scientists (including Balling) worked, citing concerns about these scientists' conflicts of interest and non-disclosure of corporate funding. In these letters, Grijalva requested records on the funding and testimony prepared before a government body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/03/12/asu-prof-shocked-target-dems-climate-probe/70164776/ | title=ASU prof 'shocked' to be target of Dems' climate probe | work=Arizona Republic | date=12 March 2015 | accessdate=14 September 2016 | author=Ryman, Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2015/03/11/grijalva-asu-researcher/70181160/ | title=Drop the climate-change witch hunt | work=Arizona Republic | date=11 March 2015 | accessdate=14 September 2016 | author=Editorial Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on global warming==
Balling believes that humans are increasing the level of [[CO2 in Earth's atmosphere]], and that the Earth should warm as a result. Balling also considers the mainstream description of climate change to be "a vastly overrated threat whose proposed solutions are worse than the problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2003/12/22/Climate-Taking-stock-of-what-is-known/UPI-92281072116663/ | title=Climate: Taking stock of what is known | work=[[UPI]] | date=22 December 2003 | accessdate=26 March 2014 | author=Whipple, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he has dismissed the idea that use of renewable energy could be an effective strategy for combating global warming as "absurd."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.carolinajournal.com/exclusives/display_exclusive.html?id=3169 | title='Warming' Skeptic Stresses Costs | work=[[Carolina Journal]] | date=8 March 2006 | accessdate=31 March 2014 | author=Kokai, Mitch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Climate of Extremes'', Balling, along with his co-author Patrick Michaels, contend that certain phenomena usually attributed to anthropogenic global warming have actually been occurring for more than a century. The phenomena named include the loss of ice on [[Mount Kilimanjaro]].&lt;ref name=FA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/65615/patrick-j-michaels-and-robert-c-balling-jr/climate-of-extremes-global-warming-science-they-dont-want-you-to | title=Climate of Extremes: Global Warming Science They Don't Want You to Know | work=[[Foreign Affairs]] | date=November–December 2009 | accessdate=21 March 2014 | author=Cooper, Richard N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balling has made similar statements about [[current sea level rise]]; namely, that it has been occurring for 8,000 years and it is therefore "quite a stretch" to blame it on global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/climate/2006-05-30-sports-globalwarming_x.htm?csp=34 | title=Sports offers a new arena for climate change concerns | work=[[USA Today]] | date=5 June 2006 | accessdate=26 March 2014 | author=Ruibal, Sai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to Balling's views on global warming===
In the December 1995 issue of [[Harper's Magazine]], [[Ross Gelbspan]] described Balling and other global warming skeptics as "extraordinarily adept at draining the [global warming] issue of all sense of crisis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1996-01-25/news/the-center-of-the-warm/full/ | title=The Center of the Warm | work=[[Phoenix New Times]] | date=25 January 1996 | accessdate=16 July 2014 | author=Plank, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Climate of Extremes'' was reviewed in [[Foreign Affairs]] by [[Richard N. Cooper]], who concluded that "Even if the authors have cherry-picked their scientific papers, this book is a useful antidote to the heavy dose of hype to which the public is regularly subjected."&lt;ref name=FA/&gt; By contrast, ''The Satanic Gases'', another Balling-Michaels collaboration which was published in 2000, received a scathing review from ''[[American Scientist]]''. Reviewer [[John Firor]] argued that the book "does not fulfill" its claim (on the [[dust jacket]]) that global warming predictions are "simply wrong", that Michaels and Balling criticized the [[Kyoto Protocol]] without having read it, and that they quoted a well-known scientist out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/heat-vs-light-in-the-global-warming-wars | title=Heat vs. Light in the Global Warming Wars | work=American Scientist | date=November–December 2000 | accessdate=26 March 2014 | author=Firor, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Balling wrote an article for [[TCS Daily]] harshly criticizing [[An Inconvenient Truth]] as scientifically inaccurate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=052406F |title=Inconvenient Truths Indeed |accessdate=2014-04-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601205454/http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=052406F |archivedate=June 1, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; his article was itself criticized as inaccurate by [[Judd Legum]], who said that the article used "misleading scientific arguments." Legum's critique was endorsed by geochemist Eric Steig, a contributor to [[RealClimate]], who said that "All those points are accurate," and that "Some of them could probably have been stronger; that is, Balling is even more wrong that Legum indicates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2006/06/10/truths/ | title=Did Al get the science right? | work=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] | date=10 June 2006 | accessdate=16 April 2014 | author=Mieszkowski, Katharine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] '''Robert Edwin Peary Sr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪər|i}}; May 6, 1856 – February 20, 1920) was an American explorer and [[United States Navy]] officer who made several expeditions to the [[Arctic]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is best known for claiming to have reached the [[geographic North Pole]] with his expedition on April 6, 1909.

Peary was born in [[Cresson, Pennsylvania]], but was raised in [[Portland, Maine]], following his father's death at a young age. He attended [[Bowdoin College]], then joined the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|National Geodetic Survey]] as a draftsman. Peary enlisted in the navy in 1881, as a civil engineer. In 1885, he was made chief of surveying for the [[Nicaragua Canal]] (which was never built). Peary visited the Arctic for the first time in 1886, making an unsuccessful attempt to cross [[Greenland]] by [[dogsled]]. [[Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891–92|He returned in 1891]] much better prepared, and by reaching [[Independence Fjord]] (in what is now known as [[Peary Land]]) conclusively proved that Greenland was an island. He was one of the first Arctic explorers to study [[Inuit]] survival techniques.

On his 1898–1902 expedition, Peary set a new "[[Farthest North]]" record by reaching Greenland's northernmost point, [[Cape Morris Jesup]]. He also reached the northernmost point of the [[Western Hemisphere]], at the top of Canada's [[Ellesmere Island]]. Peary made two further expeditions to the Arctic, in 1905–06 and in 1908–09. During the latter, he claimed to have reached the North Pole. Peary received a number of awards from [[Learned society|geographical societies]] during his lifetime, and in 1911 received the [[Thanks of Congress]] and was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]]. He served two terms as president of [[The Explorers Club]], and retired to [[Eagle Island (Casco Bay, Maine)|Eagle Island]].

Peary's claim to have reached the North Pole was widely debated in contemporary newspapers (along with a competing claim made by [[Frederick Cook]]), but eventually won widespread acceptance. However, in a 1989 book British explorer [[Wally Herbert]] concluded that Peary did not reach the pole, although he may have been as close as {{convert|60|mi|km|0}}. His conclusions have been widely accepted, although disputed by some authorities.

==Early life, education and career==
[[File:Peary.jpg|thumb|right|Peary, c. 1900]]
Robert Edwin Peary was born on May 6, 1856, in [[Cresson, Pennsylvania]], to Charles N. and Mary P. Peary. After his father died in 1859, Peary's mother took the boy with her and settled in [[Portland, Maine]].&lt;ref name="NavalHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/bios/peary_roberte.htm |title=Rear Admiral Robert E. Peary, US Navy 1856–1920 |work=Biographies in Naval History |publisher=Naval History &amp; Heritage Command, US Navy |accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After growing up in Portland, Peary attended [[Bowdoin College]], some {{convert|36|mi|km|0}} to the north. He was a member of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] fraternities while at college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_InfoView.aspx?t=&amp;id=59 Who Belongs To Phi Beta Kappa], Phi Beta Kappa website,  accessed Oct 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowdoin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bowdoin.edu/news/archives/1bowdoincampus/005262.shtml|title=What They Packed|publisher=bowdoin.edu|accessdate=November 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1877 with a civil engineering degree.&lt;ref name=Mills510&gt;Mills 2003, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

Peary lived in [[Fryeburg, Maine]], from 1878 to 1879. During that time he made a profile survey from the top of Fryeburg's Jockey Cap Rock. The 360 degree survey names the larger hills and mountains visible from the summit. His boyhood friend, Alfred E. Burton, suggested that the profile survey be made into a monument. The survey was cast in bronze and set atop a granite cylinder, and erected to his memory by the Peary Family in 1938. A hike of less than a mile leads visitors to the summit and the monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mainetrailfinder.com/trails/trail/jockey-cap|title=Jockey Cap - Maine Trail Finder|website=www.mainetrailfinder.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After college, Peary worked as a draftsman making technical drawings in Washington, D.C., at the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] office. He joined the [[United States Navy]] and on October 26, 1881, was commissioned as a civil engineer, with the relative rank of lieutenant.&lt;ref name=NavalHistory/&gt; From 1884 to 1885 he was assistant engineer on the surveys for the Nicaragua Canal, and later became the engineer in charge. As reflected in a diary entry he made in 1885, during his time in the Navy, he resolved to be the first man to reach the North Pole.&lt;ref name=Mills510/&gt;

In April 1886 he wrote a paper for the [[National Academy of Sciences]] proposing two methods for crossing [[Greenland]]'s ice cap. One was to start from the west coast and trek about {{convert|400|mi|km|-1}} to the east coast. The second, more difficult path was to start from Whale Sound at the top of the known portion of [[Baffin Bay]] and travel north to determine whether Greenland was an island or if it extended all the way across the Arctic (1,300 miles).&lt;ref name=Mills511/&gt; Peary was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander on January 5, 1901, and to commander on April 6, 1902.&lt;ref name=NavalHistory/&gt;

==Initial Arctic expeditions==
Peary made his first expedition to the [[Arctic]] in 1886, intending to cross [[Greenland]] by [[dog sled]], taking the first of his own suggested paths. He was given six months' leave from the Navy, and he received $500 from his mother to book passage north and buy supplies. He sailed on a whaler to Greenland, arriving in [[Qeqertarsuaq|Godhavn]] on June 6, 1886.&lt;ref name=Mills510/&gt; Peary wanted to make a solo trek but a young Danish official named Christian Maigaard convinced him he would die if he went out alone. Maigaard and Peary set off together and traveled nearly {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}} due east before turning back because they were short on food. This was the second-farthest penetration of Greenland's ice sheet at that date. Peary returned home knowing more of what was required for long-distance ice trekking.&lt;ref name=Mills511&gt;Mills 2003, p. 511&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matthew Henson 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Matthew Henson]], Peary's assistant, in 1910]]
Back in Washington attending with the US Navy, Peary was ordered in November 1887 to survey likely routes for a proposed [[Nicaragua Canal]]. To complete his tropical outfit he needed a sun hat, so he went to a men's clothing store. There he met 21-year-old [[Matthew Henson]], a black man working as a sales clerk. Learning that Henson had six years of seagoing experience as a [[cabin boy]],&lt;ref name=Nuttall856&gt;Nuttall 2012, p. 856&lt;/ref&gt; Peary immediately hired him as a personal [[valet]].&lt;ref name=Nuttall855&gt;Nuttall 2012, p. 855&lt;/ref&gt;

On assignment in the jungles of Nicaragua, Peary told Henson of his dream of Arctic exploration. Henson accompanied Peary on every one of his subsequent Arctic expeditions, becoming his field assistant and "first man," a critical member of his team.&lt;ref name=Mills511/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nuttall855/&gt;

==Second Greenland expedition==
In 1891 [[Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891–1892|Peary returned to Greenland]], taking the second, more difficult route that he had laid out in 1886: traveling farther north to find out whether Greenland was a much larger landmass extending to the North Pole. He was financed by several groups, including the [[American Geographic Society]], the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University|Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences]], and the [[Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences]]. Members of this expedition included Peary's aide Henson, Dr. [[Frederick A. Cook]], who served as the group's surgeon; and the expedition's ethnologist, Norwegian skier [[Eivind Astrup]]; bird expert and marksman [[Langdon Gibson]], and [[John M. Verhoeff]], who was a weatherman and mineralogist. Peary also took his wife along as dietitian, though she had no formal training.&lt;ref name=Mills511/&gt; Newspaper reports criticized Peary for bringing his wife.&lt;ref name="Conefrey"&gt;{{cite book |title=How to Climb Mt. Blanc in a Skirt: A Handbook for the Lady Adventurer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4UbYjoz0-EC&amp;pg=PT103 |page=103 |first=Mick |last=Conefrey |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2011 |isbn=0230112420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Robert Edwin Peary.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Peary in civilian clothing]]
On June 6, 1891, the party left Brooklyn, New York, in the seal hunting ship SS ''Kite''. In July, as ''Kite'' was ramming through sheets of surface ice, the ship's iron [[tiller]] suddenly spun around and broke Peary's lower leg; both bones snapped between the knee and ankle.&lt;ref name=Mills511/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conefrey/&gt;&lt;ref name="year"&gt;{{cite book |title=My Arctic Journal: A Year among Ice-fields and Eskimos |page=24 |last=Peary |first=Josephine Diebitsch |authorlink=Josephine Diebitsch Peary |publisher=Longmans, Green |year=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peary was unloaded with the rest of the supplies at a camp they called Red Cliff, and a dwelling was built for his recuperation during the next six months. Josephine stayed with Peary. Gibson, Cook, Verhoeff and Astrup hunted game by boat, and became familiar with the area and with the [[Inuit]] people.&lt;ref name=Mills511/&gt;
[[File:Robert Edwin Peary.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Peary (pictured in furs in 1909) was one of the first Arctic explorers to study Inuit survival techniques.]]
Unlike most previous explorers, Peary had studied Inuit survival techniques; he built [[igloo]]s during the expedition and dressed in practical furs in the native fashion. He adopted these practices both for heat preservation (furs) and to dispense with the extra weight of tents and sleeping bags when on the march by building igloos instead. Peary also relied on the Inuit as hunters and dog-drivers on his expeditions. He pioneered the system (which he called the "Peary system") of using support teams and establishing supply caches for Arctic travel. The Inuit were curious about the American party and came to visit Red Cliff. Josephine was bothered by the Inuit people's smell (they did not bathe), by their flea infestations and by their food. However, she studied the people and kept a journal of her experiences.&lt;ref name=Conefrey/&gt;&lt;ref name="year"/&gt; In September 1891, Peary's men took dog sled teams and pushed inland onto the ice sheet, to lay caches of supplies. They did not go farther than {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} from Red Cliff.&lt;ref name=Mills511/&gt;

Peary's leg mended in February 1892. By April, he made some short trips with Josephine and an Inuit dog sled driver to native villages to purchase supplies. On May 3, 1892, Peary finally set out on the intended trek with Henson, Gibson, Cook and Astrup. At about the {{convert|150|mi|km|-1|adj=on}} mark, Peary continued on with Astrup. The two found the {{convert|1000|m|ft|adj=on}} high view from Navy Cliff to be revealing: they saw [[Independence Fjord]] and concluded that Greenland was an island. The men trekked back to Red Cliff and got there on August 6, having traveled a total of {{convert|1250|mi|km|-1}}.&lt;ref name=Mills511/&gt;

==1898–1902 expeditions==
[[File:Ipy-conger1 figure-01.jpg|thumb|Peary used abandoned [[Fort Conger]] during his 1898–1902 expedition]]
As a result of Peary's 1898–1902 expedition, he claimed an 1899 visual discovery of "Jesup Land" west of Ellesmere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00045603709357155 | author = William Herbert Hobbs | title = The Progress of Discovery and Exploration Within the Arctic Region | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | year = 1937 | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | page = 16 | doi=10.1080/00045603709357155}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that this sighting of [[Axel Heiberg Island]] was prior to its discovery by Norwegian explorer [[Otto Sverdrup]]'s expedition. This contention has been universally rejected by exploration societies and historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=v6THcynQQDMC | author = Harold Horwood | title = Bartlett: The Great Explorer | publisher = Doubleday Canada | year = 2010 | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the American Geographical Society and [[Royal Geographical Society of London]] honored Peary for tenacity, mapping of previously uncharted areas, and his discovery in 1900 of [[Cape Morris Jesup|Cape Jesup]] at the north tip of Greenland.  Peary also achieved a "farthest north" for the western hemisphere in 1902 north of Canada's [[Ellesmere Island]].

==1905–1906 expedition==
Peary's next expedition was supported by a $50,000 gift by George Crocker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peary Gets $50,000; M.K. Jesup Gives $25,000|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 13, 1905|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was the youngest son of the banker [[Charles Crocker]]. Peary used the money for a new ship. The {{SS|Roosevelt|1905|6}} [[Ice navigation|navigated through the ice]] between Greenland and Ellesmere Island, establishing an American hemisphere "farthest north by ship."  The 1906 "Peary System" dogsled drive for the pole across the rough sea ice of the Arctic Ocean started from the north tip of Ellesmere at 83° north latitude. The parties made well under {{convert|10|mi|km}} a day until they became separated by a storm.
[[File:Peary's steamer Roosevelt, Hudson-Fulton Parade.jpg|thumb|right|''Roosevelt'' in the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration|Hudson-Fulton parade]] in 1909]]

Peary was inadvertently without a companion sufficiently trained in navigation to verify his account from that point northward. With insufficient food, and with uncertainty about whether he could negotiate the ice between him and land, he made the best possible dash and barely escaped with his life off the melting ice.  On April 20, he was no further north than 86°30' latitude.&lt;ref&gt;For obvious reasons, this latitude was never published by Peary. It is in a typescript of his April 1906 diary, discovered by [[Wally Herbert]] in his assessment commissioned by the [[National Geographic Society]] in the late 1980s. (Herbert, 1989). The typescript suddenly stopped there, one day before Peary's April 21 purported "farthest". The original of the April 1906 record is the only missing diary of Peary's exploration career. (Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#cpwf Contributions]).&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed the next day to have achieved a [[Farthest North]] world record at 87°06' and returned to 86°30' without camping, an implied trip of at least {{convert|72|nmi|km}} between sleeping, even assuming direct travel with no detours.

After returning to ''Roosevelt'' in May, Peary in June began weeks of difficult travel by heading west along the shore of Ellesmere. He discovered Cape Colgate, from the summit of which he claimed in his 1907 book&lt;ref&gt;R. Peary, ''Nearest the Pole'', 1907, pp. 202, 207, and 280&lt;/ref&gt; that he had seen a previously undiscovered far-north "[[Crocker Land]]" to the northwest on June 24, 1906. A later review of his diary for this time and place found that he had written, "No land visible."&lt;ref&gt;Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#ypcx Contributions]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 15, 1906, the [[National Geographic Society]] of the United States, which was primarily known for publishing a popular magazine, certified Peary's 1905-6 expedition and "Farthest" with its highest honor, the Hubbard Gold Medal. No major professional geographical society followed suit. In 1914 [[Donald Baxter MacMillan|Donald MacMillan]] and Fitzhugh Green's expedition found that Crocker Land did not exist.

==Final 1908–1909 expedition==
[[File:Photograph of the Robert Peary Sledge Party Posing with Flags at the North Pole - NARA - 542472.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Peary party at what they believed to be the North Pole.]]
For his final assault on the Pole, Peary and 23 men, including [[Ross Gilmore Marvin]], set off from [[New York City]] on July 6, 1908 aboard the SS ''Roosevelt'' under the command of Captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]]. They wintered near [[Cape Sheridan]] on [[Ellesmere Island]], and from Ellesmere departed for the pole on February 28 – March 1, 1909. The last support party was turned back from "Bartlett Camp" on April 1, 1909, in latitude no greater than 87°45' north. (The figure commonly given, 87°47', is based upon Bartlett's slight miscomputation of the distance of a single [[Thomas Hubbard Sumner|Sumner line]] from the pole.) On the final stage of the journey toward the North Pole, Peary told Bartlett to stay behind. He continued with five assistants, none capable of making navigation observations: American [[Matthew Henson]], and Inuit ''Ootah'', ''Egigingwah'', ''Seegloo'' and ''Ooqueah''. On April 6, 1909, he established "Camp Jesup" allegedly within {{convert|5|mi|km}} of the pole.

Peary was unable to fully enjoy the fruits of his labors. Upon returning to civilization, he learned that Dr. [[Frederick A. Cook]], who had been a surgeon on the 1891–1892 Peary expedition, claimed to have reached the pole in 1908.&lt;ref name=Nuttall856/&gt; After some [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-discovered-the-north-pole-116633746/?no-ist court trials], Peary was declared right and Cook wrong.

==Later life==
[[File:The American Museum journal (c1900-(1918)) (17537599864).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Peary in naval uniform]]
Peary was promoted to the rank of captain in the Navy on October 20, 1910.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', October 11, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; By his lobbying,&lt;ref&gt;See Congressman de Alva Alexander in Rawlins, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Peary headed off a move among some US Congressmen to have his claim to the pole evaluated by other explorers. Eventually recognized by Congress to have "attained" the pole, Peary was given the [[Thanks of Congress]] by a special act of March 3, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', March 4, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;  By a special act of Congress on March 30, 1911, Peary was promoted to the rank of [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] in the Navy Civil Engineer Corps retroactive to April 6, 1909, and retired the same day.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', March 30, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the same year, he retired to [[Eagle Island (Casco Bay, Maine)|Eagle Island]] on the coast of [[Maine]], in the town of Harpswell. (His home there has been designated a Maine State Historic Site.)  Following his retirement, Peary received many honors from numerous scientific societies of Europe and America for his Arctic explorations and discoveries.

He served twice as president of [[The Explorers Club]] from 1909 to 1911 and 1913 to 1916.
[[File:The Three Polar Stars, 1913 (8889621500).jpg|thumb|left|The "Three Polar Stars" – [[Roald Amundsen]] {South Pole}, [[Ernest Shackleton]], and Robert Peary {North Pole}– together in January 1913]]
In early 1916, Peary became chairman of the National Aerial Coast Patrol Commission, a private organization created by the [[Aero Club of America]]. It advocated the use of aircraft in detecting warships and [[submarine]]s off the U.S. coast.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', January 24, 1916 and March 31, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; Peary used his celebrity to promote the use of military and naval aviation, which led directly to the formation of [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] aerial coastal patrol units during the [[First World War]].

At the close of the First World War, Peary proposed a system of eight air mail routes, which became the genesis of the U.S. Postal Service's air mail system.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'',  November 25, 1918&lt;/ref&gt;

Peary died in Washington, D.C. on February 20, 1920. He was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. More than 60 years later, Matthew Henson was honored by being re-interred nearby in Arlington Cemetery on April 6, 1988.

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Josephine Peary portrait 1892.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Josephine Diebitsch Peary]] in 1892]]
On August 11, 1888, Peary married [[Josephine Diebitsch Peary|Josephine Diebitsch]], a business school [[valedictorian]] who thought the modern woman should be more than just a mother. Diebitsch had started working at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] when she was 19–20 years old, replacing her father after he became ill and filling his position as [[linguist]]. She resigned from the Smithsonian in 1886 upon becoming engaged to Peary.

The newlyweds honeymooned in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], then moved to Philadelphia because Peary was assigned there. Peary's mother accompanied them on their honeymoon and she moved into their Philadelphia apartment, but not without friction between the two women. Josephine told Peary that his mother should return to live in Maine.&lt;ref name="Stafford2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pearyeagleisland.org/documents/JosephinebiobyEdStafford.htm |title=Biography of Josephine Peary |first=Edward Peary |last=Stafford |work=Peary's Eagle Island |year=2004 |accessdate=December 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214045/http://www.pearyeagleisland.org/documents/JosephinebiobyEdStafford.htm |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Marie Peary.jpg|thumb|upright|Marie Ahnighito Peary was born in 1893]]
They had two children together, Marie Ahnighito and Robert Peary, Jr. His daughter wrote several books, including a children's book about the Arctic adventures. &lt;ref&gt;Peary, Marie Ahnighito, The Red Caboose (1932, William Morrow &amp; Co.).&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his life as an explorer, Peary was frequently gone for years at a time. In their first twenty-three years of his marriage, he spent only three with his wife and family. He missed the birth of his son and his early death.

While in the Arctic years later, Peary had a long-term relationship with an [[Inuit]] woman, Aleqasina (who is estimated to have been 14 when they began). She bore him at least two children, including a son Kali, identified in the late 1980s when he was an [[octogenarian]].

==Treatment of Inuit==

Peary and his aide Henson both had relationships with Inuit women outside of marriage and fathered children with them.&lt;ref name="Sherman"&gt;{{Cite book

[[S. Allen Counter]], a [[Harvard]] neuroscience professor, was interested in learning more about Henson's role in the Arctic expeditions. In 1986 he went to Greenland to do research and found Peary's son Kali and Henson's son Anaukaq, then octogenarians, and some of their descendants.&lt;ref name=counter&gt;[http://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/Matthew_Hensons_descendants_honour_their_ancestor/ Jane George, "Standing on the shoulders of a giant; Matthew Henson’s descendants honour their ancestor"], ''Nunatsiaq News Online'', 9 April 2009, accessed 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He arranged to bring the men and their families to the United States to meet their American relatives and see their fathers' gravesites.&lt;ref name=counter/&gt; Counter wrote about Peary's and Henson's Inuit children, and their meeting with their American half-siblings and other relatives in his book, ''North Pole Legacy: Black, White and Eskimo'' (1991). He also gained national recognition of Henson's role in the expeditions.&lt;ref name=counter/&gt; A subsequent documentary by the same name was also released.

==Controversy==
Peary's claim to have reached the North Pole has long been subject to doubt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/23/opinion/c-a-correction-310788.html?scp=3&amp;sq=%20Cook%20Peary%20correction%20north%20pole%20neither&amp;st=cse New York Times, "A Correction", August 23, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some polar historians believe that Peary honestly thought he had reached the pole. Others have suggested that he was guilty of deliberately exaggerating his accomplishments. Peary's account has been newly criticized by [[Pierre Berton]] (2001) and Bruce Henderson (2005).

===Lack of independent validation===
Peary did not submit his evidence for review to neutral national or international parties or to other explorers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Peary's claim was certified by the [[National Geographic Society]] (NGS) in 1909 after a cursory examination of Peary's records, as NGS was a major sponsor of his expedition. This was a few weeks before Cook's Pole claim was rejected by a Danish panel of explorers and navigational experts.

The National Geographic Society limited access to Peary's records. At the time, his proofs were not made available to scrutiny by other professionals, as had been done by the Danish panel.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} [[Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor|Gilbert Grosvenor]] persuaded the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] not to get involved. The [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS) of London gave Peary its gold medal in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Special to the|first=New York Times|date=December 16, 1909|title=NATIONS HAIL PEARY AS POLE DISCOVERER|url=|journal=New York Times|volume=|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite internal council splits which only became known in the 1970s. The RGS based their decision on the belief that the NGS had performed a serious scrutiny of the "proofs", which was not the case.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Neither the [[American Geographical Society]] nor any of the geographical societies of semi-Arctic [[Scandinavia]] has recognized Peary's North Pole claim.

===Criticisms===

====Omissions in navigational documentation====
The party that accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey included no one else who was trained in navigation and could independently confirm (or contradict) Peary's own navigational work, a point exacerbated by Peary's omission to produce records of observed data for steering, for the direction ("[[Magnetic declination|variation]]") of the compass, for his [[longitude|longitudinal]] position at any time, or for zeroing-in on the pole either [[latitude|latitudinally]] or [[longitude|transversely]] beyond Bartlett Camp.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, 1989; Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#wpst Contributions]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inconsistent speeds====
[[File:PearyBartlett.png|thumb|right|Robert Peary and Captain Robert Bartlett, standing on ship at [[Battle Harbour]], [[Labrador]], in 1909]]
The last five marches when Peary was accompanied by a navigator (Capt. Bob Bartlett) averaged no better than {{convert|13|mi|km}} marching north. But once the last support party turned back at "Camp Bartlett" from where Bartlett was ordered southward, at least {{convert|133|nmi|km}} from the pole, Peary's claimed speeds immediately doubled for the five marches to Camp Jesup, and then quadrupled during the 2½ day return to Camp Bartlett—at which point his speed slowed drastically compared to that pace.  Peary's account of a beeline journey to the pole and back — which would have assisted his claim of such speed — is contradicted by companion [[Matthew Henson|Henson]]'s account of tortured detours to avoid "pressure ridges" (ice floes' rough edges, often a few meters high) and "leads" (of open water between those floes).

The conflicting and unverified claims of Cook and Peary prompted [[Roald Amundsen]] to take extensive precautions in navigation during his Antarctic expedition so as to leave no room for doubt concerning his 1911 attainment of the [[South Pole]], which (like [[Robert Falcon Scott|Robert Scott]]'s a month later in 1912) was supported by the [[sextant]], [[theodolite]], and [[compass]] observations of several other navigators. See [[Polheim]].

In sum, Peary claimed to travel (in his official report) a total of 304 nautical miles between April 2, 1909 (when he left Bartlett's last camp) and April 9 (when he returned there), 133 NMs to the pole, 133 NMs back and 38 nautical miles in the vicinity of the pole.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} These distances are counted without detours due to drift, leads and difficult ice, i.e. the distance travelled must have been significantly higher to make good the distance claimed.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
Peary and his party arrived back in Cape Columbia on the morning of April 23, 1909, only about two and a half days after Capt Bartlett, yet Peary claimed he had traveled a minimum of 304 NMs more than Bartlett (to the Pole and vicinity).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

====Review of diary====
[[File:Diary of Robert E. Peary - NARA - 304960.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Peary's diary entry for arrival at the [[North Pole]]]]
The diary that Robert E. Peary kept on his 1909 polar expedition was finally made available for research in 1986. Historian [[Larry Schweikart]] examined it, finding that: the writing was consistent throughout (giving no evidence of post-expedition alteration), that there were consistent [[pemmican]] and other stains on all pages, and that all evidence was consistent with a conclusion that Peary's observations were made on the spot he claimed. Schweikart had compared the reports and experiences of Japanese explorer [[Naomi Uemura]], who reached the North Pole alone in 1978, to those of Peary and found they were consistent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Schweikart]], "Polar Revisionism and the Peary Claim: The Diary of Robert E. Peary," ''The Historian'', XLVIII, May 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Peary made no entries in the diary on the crucial days 6 and 7 April 1909, and his famous words "The Pole at Last!", allegedly written in his diary at the pole, were written on loose slips of paper that were inserted into the diary.

====1989 National Geographic Society studies====
In 1984 the National Geographic Society (a major sponsor of Peary's expeditions) commissioned the Arctic explorer [[Wally Herbert]] to write an assessment of Peary’s original 1909 diary and astronomical observations. As Herbert researched the material, he came to believe that Peary must have falsified his records and concluded that he did not reach the Pole.  His book, ''The Noose of Laurels'', caused a furor when it was published in 1989. His conclusion has been widely accepted.&lt;ref name="Herbert"&gt;[http://www.americanpolar.org/sir-wally-herbert/ American Polar Society: Sir Wally Herbert]&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert, who reached the Pole in 1969, is recognized as the first man leading a team to reach the Pole.

In 1989 the NGS also conducted two-dimensional photogrammetric analysis of the shadows in photographs and a review of ocean depth measures taken by Peary; its staff concluded that he was no more than {{convert|5|mi|km}} away from the pole. Peary's original camera (a 1908 #4 Folding Pocket Kodak) has not survived. As such cameras were made with at least six different lenses from various manufacturers, the focal length of the lens—and hence the shadow analysis based on it—must be considered uncertain at best.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The NGS has never released Peary's photos for independent analysis. Specialists questioned the Society's conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;"Washington Post", December 12, 1989; "Scientific American", March and June, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The NGS commissioned the Foundation for the Promotion of the Art of Navigation to resolve the issue. Reporting on its conclusion that Peary had reached the Pole, Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the NGS, said, “I consider this the end of a historic controversy and the confirmation of due justice to a great explorer.”{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The Navigation Foundation published its full report on December 11, 1989.

====Review of depth soundings====
Supporters of Peary and Henson assert that the depth soundings they made on the outward journey have been matched by recent surveys, and so their claim of having reached the Pole is confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matthewhenson.com/northpoleproofDEPTH2.htm "Proof Henson &amp; Peary reached Pole"], ''Matthew A Henson website''. Retrieved August 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the first few of the Peary party's soundings, taken nearest the shore, touched bottom; experts have said their usefulness is limited to showing that he was above deep water.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Peary's expedition possessed 4000 fathoms of sounding line, but he took only 2000 with him over an ocean already established as being deeper in many regions. See, D. Rawlins, ''U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings'', June 1970, p. 38, and ''Polar Notes'' (Dartmouth College), volume 10, October, 1970, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Peary stated (in 1909 Congressional hearings about the expedition) that he made no longitudinal observations during his trip, only latitude observations, yet he maintained he stayed on the "Columbia meridian" all along, and that his soundings were made on this meridian.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The pack ice was moving all the time, so he had no way of knowing where he was without longitudinal observations.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Recreation of expedition in 2005===
British explorer [[Tom Avery]] and four companions recreated the outward portion of Peary's journey in 2005, using replica wooden sleds and [[Canadian Eskimo Dog]] teams. They ensured their sled weights were the same as Peary's sleds throughout their journey. They reached the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours – nearly five hours faster than Peary.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/det.htm#pdxm Zero]&lt;/ref&gt; Avery writes on his web site that &lt;blockquote&gt;"The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from Cape Columbia. Having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice, I am more convinced than ever that Peary did indeed discover the North Pole."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomavery.net/gallery_np2005.html Tom Avery website], retrieved May 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215115623/http://www.tomavery.net/gallery_np2005.html |date=February 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After reaching the Pole, Avery and his team were airlifted off the ice rather than returning by dogsled.

Analysis of the speeds made by Avery do more to cast doubt on Peary's claim than to confirm it.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} While Peary claimed {{convert|130|nmi|km}} made good in his last five marches, horrific ice conditions meant that Avery managed only 71{{which|date=December 2014}} in his last five marches. Avery never exceeded {{convert|90|nmi|km}} in any five-day stretch, and was losing over {{convert|7|mi|km}} a day at this time to the southerly drift of the ice.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Avery matched Peary's overall 37-day total in part because Peary was held up by open water for five days at the Big Lead. But Peary had a team consisting of 133 dogs and 25 men, meaning he was able to keep his "polar party" fresh for the sprint to the Pole. Peary's team was more experienced than Avery's at dog sledding.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

*The lunar crater [[Peary (crater)|Peary]], appropriately located at the moon's north pole, is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/4627 Peary], Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN)&lt;/ref&gt; The crater name was approved in 1964.

The explorer Major General [[Adolphus Greely]] noted that no Arctic expert questions that Peary courageously risked his life traveling hundreds of miles from land, and that he reached regions adjacent to the pole. (After initial acceptance of Peary's claim, he later came to doubt Peary's having reached 90°.) In his book ''Ninety Degrees North: The Quest for the North Pole'' (2001), polar historian Fergus Fleming describes Peary as "undoubtedly the most driven, possibly the most successful and probably the most unpleasant man in the annals of polar exploration."

==Representation in other media==
Peary's exploits and life were portrayed in the 1998 [[TV movie]] ''[[Glory &amp; Honor]]''. [[Henry Czerny]] played Robert Peary. His associate Matthew Henson was played by [[Delroy Lindo]]. The film won a [[Primetime Emmy]] and Lindo won a [[Golden Satellite Award]] for his performance.

[[E.L. Doctorow]]'s novel ''Ragtime'' (1974) has as a major character Father, a member of Peary's 1908 polar expedition. The expedition is described from the point of view of one not chosen for the final polar attempt.

[[Pierre Berton]] Canadian author and historian, wrote extensively about Peary and his Arctic expeditions in his book: (1988 Anchor Canada {{ISBN|0-385-65845-1}}. OCLC 46661513.) ''The Arctic Grail: The Quest for the North West Passage and the North Pole, 1818–1909''.

[[Image:Ropsten 1795.jpg|thumb|350px|Painting by [[Piere Joseph Trere]] from 1795 showing the area around Ropsten before the first bridge was built between [[Stockholm]] (to the right) and [[Lidingö]] (to the left). The large rock in the middle of the painting has named the place. A ferry is on its way from Ropsten to Lidingö with a horse and cart on board.]]

'''Ropsten''' is a cape at the eastern part of [[Stockholm]] mainland at the inner part of Stockholm [[archipelago]] in [[Sweden]]. Two bridges named [[Lidingöbron]] extend from Ropsten over to the island of [[Lidingö]]. Ropsten area is located between [[Hjorthagen]] and the Stockholm city main port [[Värtahamnen]]. Ropsten is the terminal station for the eastern part of [[Stockholm Metro]] system and is also the terminal station for [[Lidingöbanan]], the railway for public transportation, covering the area of Lidingö.

==History==
Ropsten has been the communication center for the traffic between Stockholm and Lidingö since the 13th or 14th century, when the first inhabitants settled on Lidingö and began farming, 200–300 years after the end of the [[Viking Age]].

The name "Ropsten" stems from the fact that in old times, going back to the 13th or 14th century, people used to shout out loud from this area to Lidingö, a distance of about 750 meters, to call for a boat transport over to [[Lidingö]], before the first regular rowboat ferry line was introduced and before the first bridge was built. In the old times, the part of the Ropsten area close to the waterfront was  named ''Ropudden'' (corresponding to "cape shout"). The large rock or [[islet]] in the water close to this cape gave the place its name, "the rock at cape shout", ''Ropsten''. The rock itself, however, was probably not used as a place to shout from, as it was surrounded by water (during average sea level conditions) according to old maps from the end of the 17th century, in particular a map from 1696. When there was an extreme low sea level&lt;ref&gt;The sea level in the [[Baltic Sea]] normally fluctuates between -0.5 meter to +0.5 meter, in extreme case up to one meter, depending on atmospheric tide differences between the Baltic Sea and the [[North Sea]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. When there is high atmospheric pressure in the Baltic area compared to the atmospheric pressure in the North Sea for a longer period, the water is pressed out into the Atlantic Ocean and the water level will sink.&lt;/ref&gt; it was probably possible to reach the rock by foot, as indicated on the painting by [[Piere Joseph Trere]] from 1795.

The entire area, named Ropsten, dramatically changed appearance in just a few years when the first bridge between Ropsten and Lidingö and the main port for Stockholm was built in this area from around 1884. Today nothing remains of the old Ropsten as it appears on the painting from 1795.

'''Rysy''' ([[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Rysy'', {{IPA-pl|ˈrɨsɨ}}; {{lang-de|Meeraugspitze}}, {{lang-hu|Tengerszem-csúcs}}) is a [[mountain]] in the crest of the [[High Tatras]], eastern part of the [[Tatra Mountains]], lying on the border between [[Poland]] and [[Slovakia]]. Rysy has three summits: the middle at {{convert|2503|m|abbr=on}}; the north-western at {{convert|2499|m|abbr=on}}; and the south-eastern at {{convert|2473|m|abbr=on}}. The north-western summit is the [[Extreme points of Poland|highest point of Poland]] and belongs to [[Crown of Polish Mountains]]; the other two summits are on the Slovak side of the border. 

==Name==
Experts assume that the [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] name ''Rysy'', meaning "scratches" or "crevices", refers to a series of [[gully|gullies]], either those on the western slopes of Żabie Ridge or the very prominent {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}} high gully and numerous smaller ones on the northern side. A [[Folk etymology|folk explanation]] on the Slovak side says that the name comes from the plural word ''rysy'' meaning "[[lynx]]es", although the habitat of the lynx does not extend above the [[Tree line|timberline]].

The [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] name ''Tengerszem-csúcs'' and the [[German language|German]] name ''Meeraugspitze'' mean "eye-of-the-sea peak", from the glacial lake at the northern foot of the mountain, called "eye of the sea" (''[[Morskie Oko]]'' in Polish).

==History==
The first known [[Mountaineering|ascent]] was made in 1840, by Anika Altman and her guide Ján Ruman-Driečny, Sr. The first winter ascent was completed in 1884, by Theodor Wundt and Jakob Horvay. In the 20th century, the [[Communism|communist]] authorities claimed [[Vladimir Lenin]] climbed the mountain sometime in the early 1910s. Rysy is the highest point in Poland.

==Tourism==
Rysy is the highest peak in the [[Tatra Mountains]] that is accessible to individual [[tourism|tourists]] on foot without a [[mountain guide]]. It is possible to ascend the peak from the Slovak side, starting at [[Štrbské pleso]] and passing ''Chata pod Rysmi'', a mountain chalet at an altitude of {{convert|2250|m|abbr=on}}, open during the summer season (from June 15 to October 31). The mountain can also be ascended from the Polish side coming from the [[Morskie Oko]] lake, which is a harder and steeper route. 

In the period November 1 - June 14, the trail on the Slovak side is closed.

The [[winter]] ascent from the Polish side is a serious climb requiring the right equipment ([[crampons]], [[Ice axe]]) and skills, often with a large [[avalanche]] threat. 

Since the accession of Poland and Slovakia to the [[Schengen Agreement]] in 2007, the border between the two countries may be easily crossed at this point like at any other.

==Development==
Development rights to Sahl Hasheesh are held by Egyptian Resorts Company (ERC), who purchased the land in 1995. ERC itself was founded in 1995 and publicly listed in 1999. ERC had a vision of a huge project for this area. Plans for the 12-square mile community were to be completed by 2020.&lt;ref name="Fodors"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stallings|first1=Doug|title=Fodors Egypt, Volume 3|date=2009|publisher=Fodors|isbn=9781400007301|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The builder's stated objective was "to create a fully integrated mixed-use resort city, with the aim of achieving long-term economic and environmental sustainability."&lt;ref name="ResortWebsite" /&gt;

The residential units at ''El Andulous'', in Sahl Hasheesh, were completed in 2008 and sold out quickly.&lt;ref name="El Andalous"&gt;{{cite web|title=El Andalous Residence|url=http://www.orbitalliance.com/sahl-hasheesh/completed-developments/el-andalous-sahl-hasheesh|website=Orbit Alliance|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317140945/http://www.orbitalliance.com/sahl-hasheesh/completed-developments/el-andalous-sahl-hasheesh|archivedate=2017-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palm Beach Piazza and Family Resort Ocean Breeze are the other residential projects selling apartments and villas in Sahl Hasheesh.&lt;ref name="ERC Investor Relations" /&gt;

In the [[resort town]], tourists and residents can find something of a treasure, a partly submerged artificial city. This artificial reef attracts fish and is a favorite with tourists, for diving and snorkeling.&lt;ref name="Video"&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Holiday Reporter erkunden die City of Isis "The Sunken City" / Sahl Hasheesh / Ägypten|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbjVJBBcO-w|website=YouTube Holiday Reporter Channel|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ResortWebsite"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sahl Hasheesh Resort|url=http://www.sahlhasheesh.com/invest/?page=the-master-developer/|website=SahlHasheesh|accessdate=5 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105161147/http://www.sahlhasheesh.com/invest/?page=the-master-developer%2F|archivedate=5 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Oberoi Sahl Hasheesh was rated as one of the more upscale resorts in the Middle East and won first place in Trip Advisors 2016 Travelers Choice Award of top 25 Luxury Hotels in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Luxury Hotels in Egypt|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Hotels-cLuxury-g294200#1|website=Trip Advisor|accessdate=5 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105224509/https://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Hotels-cLuxury-g294200#1|archivedate=5 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Upscale"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Teller|first1=Matthew|title=The Traveller's Guide to the Red Sea|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/middle-east/the-travellers-guide-to-the-red-sea-1829299.html|accessdate=5 November 2016|agency=The Independent|date=November 27, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105223501/http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/middle-east/the-travellers-guide-to-the-red-sea-1829299.html|archivedate=5 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hotels at the resort were in the top 10 of Hurgada hotels, as well.&lt;ref name="Baron Palace"&gt;{{cite web|title=Baron Palace Sahl Hasheesh|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297549-d6510502-Reviews-Baron_Palace_Sahl_Hasheesh-Hurghada_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html|website=Trip Advisor|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719001405/https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297549-d6510502-Reviews-Baron_Palace_Sahl_Hasheesh-Hurghada_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html|archivedate=2017-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Bloomberg Financial reported that the developer was struggling to sell its properties and had lost a lot of value in its stock.&lt;ref name="Frontier" /&gt; But in 2016, the developer had a strong financial balance sheet and its hotels were being highly rated by tourists from around the world.&lt;ref name="ERC Investor Relations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Investor Relations Latest News|url=http://ir.erc-egypt.com/|website=erc-egypt|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230090138/http://ir.erc-egypt.com/|archivedate=2016-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''Superior Mayor of Bogotá''' (''Alcalde Mayor de Bogotá'') is the highest administrative and police authority of the Special District of [[Bogotá]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=327|title = Article 59,  Decreto ley 1421 de 1993|date = 21 July 1993|accessdate = 7 October 2015|website = http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/|publisher = Alcaldia de Bogota|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the head of the executive branch of the local government of Bogotá. He heads the district's government alongside  the distrital secretaries and the chiefs of the administrative departments.

The mayor is not the highest political authority of Bogota, distinction that belongs to [[Bogotá City Council|District's City Council]]  which is charged with creating municipal ordinances and overseeing the mayor's duties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The mayor is elected every four years by [[Direct election|popular vote]] and is usually considered by general opinion to be the second most important political post in [[Colombia]] second only to the [[President of Colombia|President of the Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://colombiareports.com/who-wants-to-be-mayor-of-bogota/|title = Who wants to be mayor of Bogota?|last = Dancis|first = Matthew|date = 8 May 2015|work = Colombia Reports|access-date = 7 October 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Superior Mayor of Bogota's Office oversees twenty local municipalities ''(localidades)'' which each have their own local Mayors.

== Current Mayor ==
The current mayor is Enrique Peñalosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gustavo Petro Urrego, alcalde Mayor de Bogotá {{!}} Portal Bogota {{!}} Bogota.gov.co|url = http://www.bogota.gov.co/gobierno/gustavo-petro-urrego-alcalde-mayor-de-bogota|website = www.bogota.gov.co|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
The Superior Mayor of Bogota is primarily tasked with executing the norms stipulated by the constitution, the law, and city ordinances approved by the City Council.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leyes desde 1992 - Vigencia expresa y control de constitucionalidad [DECRETO_1421_1993]|url = http://www.secretariasenado.gov.co/senado/basedoc/decreto_1421_1993.html|website = www.secretariasenado.gov.co|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the highest police authority of The District he is tasked with maintaining public order, being subordinated on this matter only to the President.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Article 186 Acuerdo 79 del Concejo de Bogotá de 2003|url = http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=6671|website = www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way the District's Mayor Office is different from other municipalities in Colombia where the Mayor's are subordinated on this matter to the governors of the respective d[[Departments of Colombia|epartments]]. The Superior Mayor of Bogota has the same police authorities as all other Colombian mayors ''and'' governors within their respective jurisdictions such as elaborating police directives, commanding all police members assigned to the district, soliciting the help of the army during an [[emergency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Article 87. DECRETO 1355 DE 1970|url = http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=6945|website = www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ordering the demolition of buildings that pose a threat to public safety,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Article 216. DECRETO 1355 DE 1970.|url = http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=6945|website = www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; regulating local commerce and the sell and distribution of liquor, amongst others.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Consulta de la Norma:|url = http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=9027|website = Articulo 38. Decreto Ley 1421 de 1993.|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the supreme administrative authority and head of the local executive government he is charged with directing all [[public works]], as well supervising the continuous provision of all essential [[public service]]s.As the judicial representative of the city, he and his delegates are  competent to carry out contracts or agreements which are legally binding for the City itself.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Mayor also has normative prerogatives. He might create those [[regulation]]s, resolutions or orders he considers necessary to carry out [[Local ordinance|City Ordinances]], mirroring the normative faculties the President has when it comes to implementing laws passed by [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As for his administrative duties he can freely appoint and remove the Secretaries of the various secretariats that make up the Superior Mayor's Office and the managers of the decentralized entities vinculated to his office . He may also do the same with all the functionaries of the central sector of the dependencies overseen by his office who are appointed to their post. He is tasked with overseeing the conduct of all the public servants under his authority and is competent to impose disciplinary sanctions after dues process to any of them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In those dependencies that belong to the Central Sector and are ascribed to his Office, he may freely create or eliminate posts, attribute said posts their functions, and decide the remuneration of those employees directly under his authority in accordance with the City's budget and in compliance with the law.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Every year he is tasked with presenting an inform of his administration to the City Council.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Distrital Administration ==
The distrital administration of Bogota is headed by the Superior Mayor and is made up of various entities belonging to the central sector, the decentralized sector, and the local municipalities. Though the Bogotá City Council forms part of the [[Executive Branch of Colombia|executive branch of the Colombian government]], and is in charge of the administration of the city, it is not technically part of the Distrital Administration since it has no executive functions related to the administration of the city. Also the sub national oversight bodies that operate in Bogota such as the office of the Comptroller of Bogota and the ombudsman office of Bogota are not part of the Distrital Government and are completely independent from the mayor's office.

The Superior Mayor of Bogota, as the highest official within the Distrital Administration has various and ample prerogatives when it comes to the entities that make up the Central and decentralized sectors and the local municipalities. His influence is greater in those entities that make up the central sector, lesser in the decentralized entities, and limited in the local municipalities.

=== Centralized and Decentralized entities ===
The entities that make up the Distrital Administration are created by law or by city ordinances. It is through this entities that the Mayor can execute his functions. Centralized entities don't have legal personality and are all under the direct responsibility of the Superior Mayor's Office. Decentralized entities on the other hand are administratively autonomous and have judicial personality, nevertheless the [[managers]] in charge of the decentralized entities as well as the majority of their respective [[Board of directors|boards]] are appointed by the Mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SECTOR CENTRAL Y SECTOR DESCENTRALIZADO: - Archivo Digital de Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo desde 1.990 - eltiempo.com|url = http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-517251|website = eltiempo.com|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Centralized Dependencies ====
The Centralized entities that make up the central sector are:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Consulta Orgánica por Entidad|url = http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/organica/tabla.html|website = www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Decentralized Entities ====
Decentralized entities, as stated above are somewhat autonomous. Nevertheless, its top officials are appointed by the Superior Mayor's Office and thus tend to follow the same political lines as the city's administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Article 56. Leyes desde 1992 - Vigencia expresa y control de constitucionalidad [DECRETO_1421_1993_PR001]|url = http://www.secretariasenado.gov.co/senado/basedoc/decreto_1421_1993_pr001.html|website = www.secretariasenado.gov.co|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have judicial personality which allows them to file lawsuits and be sued on their own responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Article 59.

Each decentralized entity is ascribed(if it belongs to the public sector) or vinculated (if it operates as a private enterprise) to a centralized dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://datateca.unad.edu.co/contenidos/109107/Contenido_en_linea/leccin_4_los_organismos_y_entidades_adscritas.html|title = Lección 4 Los Organismos y Entidades adscritas|date = |accessdate = 11 October 2015|website = http://datateca.unad.edu.co/|publisher = Unidad Nacional Abierta y a Distancia.|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://datateca.unad.edu.co/contenidos/109107/Contenido_en_linea/leccin_5_las_entidades_vinculadas.html|title = Lección 5 Las Entidades vinculadas|date = |accessdate = 11 October 2015|website = http://datateca.unad.edu.co/|publisher = Universidad Nacional Abierta y a Distancia.|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance the [[Lottery of Bogota]] (a private enterprise wholly owned by the City's Government) is vinculated to the Distrital Secretariat of the Treasury.

Telephone numbers in India are administered under the ''National Numbering Plan of 2003'' by the [[Department of Telecommunications]]. The numbering plan was last updated in 2015. The [[International Telecommunication Union]] has assigned the country calling code "91" to India.

==Fixed line (landline) numbers==
[[Subscriber Trunk Dialling]] (STD) codes are assigned to each city/town/village, with the larger Metro cities having shorter area codes (STD codes), which are from 2 to 8 digits long. For example,
*'''11'''   - [[New Delhi]], [[Delhi]]
*'''22'''   - [[Mumbai]], [[Maharashtra]]
*'''33'''   - [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]]
*'''44'''   - [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]]
*'''20'''   - [[Pune]], [[Maharashtra]]
*'''40'''   - [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Telangana]]
*'''79'''   - [[Ahmedabad]], [[Gujarat]]
*'''80'''   - [[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]]


Tier-2 Cities in India have STD code with 3 digits. For example,

*'''120'''  - [[Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh|Ghaziabad]]/[[Noida]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]
*'''124'''  - [[Gurgaon]], [[Haryana]]
*'''129'''  - [[Faridabad]], [[Haryana]]
*'''135'''  - [[Dehradun]], [[Uttarakhand]]
*'''141'''  - [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]]
*'''161'''  - [[Ludhiana]], [[Punjab]]
*'''172'''  - [[Chandigarh]], [[Punjab]]
*'''172'''  - [[Mohali]],  [[Punjab]]
*'''172'''  - [[Panchkula]], [[Haryana]]
*'''175'''  - [[Patiala]], [[Punjab]]
*'''181'''  - [[Jalandhar]], [[Punjab]]
*'''231'''  - [[Kolhapur]], [[Maharashtra]]
*'''240''' - [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra]]
*'''260''' - [[Valsad district|Valsad, Gujarat]] &amp; [[Daman, India]]
*'''261''' - [[Surat]], [[Gujarat]]
*'''343''' - [[Durgapur]], [[West Bengal]]
*'''484''' - [[Kochi]], [[Kerala]]
*'''512''' - [[Kanpur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]
*'''522''' - [[Lucknow]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]
*'''532''' - [[Allahabad]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]
*'''542''' - [[Varanasi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]
*'''551''' - [[Gorakhpur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]
*'''562''' - [[Agra]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]
*'''581''' - [[Bareilly]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]
*'''591''' - [[Moradabad]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]
*'''621''' - [[Muzaffarpur]], [[Bihar]]
*'''612''' - [[Patna]], [[Bihar]]
*'''641''' - [[Bhagalpur]], [[Bihar]]
*'''657''' - [[Jamshedpur]], [[Jharkhand]]
*'''870''' - [[Warangal]], [[Telangana]]
*'''891''' - [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Andhra Pradesh]]


Kanpur and Lucknow were the two cities between which the first STD call of the country was made.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The total length of all phone numbers (STD code and the phone number) in [[India]] is constant at 10 digits, for example 7513200000 signifies a STD code i.e. 751 [[Gwalior]] &amp; the phone number 3200000. 

Land line numbers are at most 8 digits long (usually in major metros). 

=== Landline operators ===
Due to the availability of multiple operators offering fixed line services (either over wire or wireless), there is an operator-code for each telephone number, which is the first digit in the phone number. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/spaper13mar09.pdf|title=National Numbering Plan – a revised approach suggested by TRAI for achieving greater transparency and efficiency|date=March 2009|website=trai.gov.in|publisher=Telecom Regulatory Authority of India|pages=9-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703073108/http://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/spaper13mar09.pdf|archive-date=2017-07-03|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiacallinginfo.com/india-local-subscriber-numbers#india-landline-phone-numbers|title=Local Phone Number Formats in India|last=|first=|date=|website=IndiaCallingInfo.com|publisher=CallingGuides.com|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[BSNL]] / [[MTNL]] - Numbers start with a '2'
* [[Reliance Communications]] - Numbers start with a '3'
* [[Bharti Airtel]] - Numbers start with a '4'
* [[MTS India]] / HFCL - Numbers start with a '5'
* [[Tata Indicom]] - Numbers start with a '6'
* Datacom Solutions - Numbers start with a '7'

Thus, a number formatted as '''020-30303030''' means a fixed-line Reliance number in Pune, while '''011-20000198''' is an MTNL fixed line in Delhi and '''033-45229320''' is a fixed-line Airtel number in Kolkata, and '''07582-221434''' is a BSNL number from [[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Sagar]], Madhya Pradesh.

=== Format for dialing landline numbers ===
No prefix is required to call from one landline to another in the same STD area. A prefix of "0+STD code" is required to dial from a landline phone in one STD code area to another. A prefix of "0+STD code" is required to dial from a mobile phone in India to any landline number, irrespective of STD area.

For example, to dial a landline number in Indore, one would have to dial
* from a landline in Indore:  the phone number
* from a landline in Mumbai: 0731 and then the phone number
* from any mobile phone in India: 0731 and then the phone number
* from outside India: Country Code 91 then 731 and then the phone number

Before 10 March 2009, as per [[Department of Telecommunications (India)|Department of Telecommunications]] [[memorandum]] dated 9 February 2009.&lt;ref name="dotmemo95"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.gov.in/as/2009/numbering%20plan_25.02.2009.pdf|title=DoT Memorandum 10th Feb 09.|accessdate=2009-04-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027155604/http://dot.gov.in/as/2009/numbering%20plan_25.02.2009.pdf|archivedate=2010-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/TRAI-for-10-digit-landline-numbers-to-meet-crunch/article16138959.ece TRAI for 10-digit landline numbers to meet crunch]&lt;/ref&gt; there were some exceptions to this general rule for STD areas falling close to each other  (within a radius of 200 kilometre), where "0" can be replaced with "95" e.g. to dial Delhi from [[Gurgaon]], one dials 9511+landline number.

== Mobile numbers ==
{{Main article|Mobile telephone numbering in India}}

A typical mobile number in India is "+91-XXXX-NNNNNN". Where the first four digits indicate a operator's code, while the remaining six digits are unique to the subscribers. However, with portability in place, the first four digits may not indicate a particular operator.

==Short code==
There are many companies in the Indian market who rent keywords, on a monthly basis, whose characters, on a typical mobile phone keypad,   represent short codes. Short codes are five digits in length and have to start with the digit '5' like 58888 as of 2007. Previously, they were four-digit in number and could be of any combination, like 8888 or 7827. The current five digits can be extended by three digits further representing 3 additional characters. Messages sent to these Short Codes are commonly referred to as Premium Rate SMS Messages and cost from per message depending on the operator as well as the service and the company.

==Telemarketing==
Telemarketers have been issued 10-digit telephone numbers starting with 140 (140XXXXXXX) by the [[Department of Telecommunications]] on [[TRAI]]'s request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/pesky-calls-trai-fails-to-set-deadline/1/136227.html Trai fails to set deadline on pesky calls]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-09-27/goa/42458841_1_telecom-service-providers-trai-telecom-regulatory-authority 'Publishing tariff plans by telecom service providers mandatory']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veliki Galijaš''' or just '''Galijaš''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[Cyrillic]]: '''Велики Галијаш''') is a canal turned lake on the [[Great War Island]], within the city of [[Belgrade]], the capital of [[Serbia]].

The former canal is one of the major physical features on the island. In time, the canal was cut off from the [[Danube]] and effectivelly turned into a lake, with an area of 0.24&amp;nbsp;km² and became the major natural bird and fish spawning area on the island, with 196 bird and 90 fish species living in it. However, during the [[drought]]y years the lake drained out completely causing damage to the closed [[eco-system]] centred on it.  In August 2007 the digging began of a 300 m-long canal which would reconnect Veliki Galijaš with the Danube and prevent the seasonal drying of the lake. After it was completed, fish from the Sava began swimming into the Veliki Galijaš. Fishing in the lake is forbidden as in the river zone up to 50m from the island's coastline.

Celebrating June 29, the international Day of the Danube, an eco-camp made of [[pile dwelling]]s for the students of the [[Belgrade University]] was opened near the lake in 2007. A 15 m-high lookout is to be erected west of Veliki Galijaš so as the entire network of visitor centres on the unsinkable points around the lake and throughout the island for the studying of the bird life. Bio-laboratory is also scheduled for construction.

The movement is the oldest of the first generation of so-called '[[new social movements]]' to spring up after the end of [[apartheid]] and is known for its [[direct action]] style militancy, its refusal of all forms of [[vanguardism]], including NGO ([[Non-governmental organization|Non-Governmental Organisations]]) [[authoritarianism]].&lt;ref name="thenation1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org/el/2007/12/897831.shtml South African Grassroots Movements Rebel Against NGO Authoritarianism], Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign, ''Indymedia'', 9 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abahlali.org/node/585 Rethinking Public Participation from Below ], by Richard Pithouse, ''Critical Dialogue'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ceasefiremagazine1"&gt;[http://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/columns/the-anti-imperialist/the-anti-imperialist-south-africa-a-revolution-in-progress/ South Africa: A Revolution in Progress], ''Ceasefire'', 9 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement has sought to retain its autonomy from NGOs&lt;ref&gt;[http://abahlali.org/files/Oldfield%20&amp;%20Stokke%20WCAEC%20Research%20Report.pdf Building unity in diversity: Social movement activism in the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign], Sophie Oldfield &amp; Kristian Stokke, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and publicly refused to work with some local NGOs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org/el/2007/12/897831.shtml South African Grassroots Movements Rebel Against NGO Authoritarianism]&lt;/ref&gt; and insists that the middle class left respect the autonomy of grassroots movements.

The AEC is a founding member of the [[Poor People's Alliance]] and, along with the other members of the alliance, refuses all electoral politics and encourages the development of popular power rather than voting for political parties.&lt;ref name="ceasefiremagazine1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capetimes.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=4780755 See the article 'Anti Eviction Campaign urges poor to boycott elections' by Aziz Hartley, ''Cape Times'', 5 January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/9282] Grassroots movements plan to boycott South African poll ''Ekklesia'', 29 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-07-02-analysis-the-das-battle-to-buddy-up-to-the-everyman The DA's battle to buddy up to the everyman], Osiame Molefe, ''The Daily Maverick'', 2 July 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The AEC opposes evictions and water and electricity cut-offs on many different levels.&lt;ref name="thenation1"/&gt;  Activities range from legal actions that challenge the constitutionality of evictions, to mass mobilisation and popular education initiatives, to organisation and capacity building programs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ceasefiremagazine1"/&gt; The movement has also confronted local gangs and in July 2012 one of its leading activists, Soraya Nordien, was murdered following threats from gang members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacsis.org.za/site/article/1362 Helen Zille's Hopeless Handling of Cape Gang Violence], Anna Majavu, ''SACSIS'', 13 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
Since its inception, the Anti-Eviction Campaign (AEC) has called for an end to all evictions and cut-offs of basic services in the Western Cape.&lt;ref name="thenation1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.landaction.org/display.php?article=67|title=Stop Forced Removals &amp; Evictions! Stop Privatisation!|publisher=Land Research Action Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the AEC achieved a 6-month moratorium on all evictions in the Cape Town Unicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jas.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/41/1-2/95 Subjectivity, Politics and Neoliberalism in Post-apartheid Cape Town]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090420/western_cape|title=Fighting Foreclosure in South Africa |publisher=The Nation Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the DA had declared the moratorium, illegal evictions continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.queensu.ca/msp/pages/In_The_News/2001/June/wc.htm|title=WESTERN CAPE ANTI-EVICTION COMMITTEE PRESS STATEMENT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement strongly supported the struggle for the [[Symphony Way Pavement Dwellers]] to resist forced removal to the notorious [[Blikkiesdorp]] transit camp and to demand access to decent housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://antieviction.org.za/2008/04/14/delft-symphony-pavement-dwellers-building-a-new-world-one-child-at-a-time/|title=Delft-Symphony Pavement Dwellers building a new world – one child at a time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[No Land! No House! No Vote!]] is the name of a campaign by autonomous grassroots movements to boycott elections and reject party politics and [[vote banking]] in South Africa. In 2009, the [[Poor People's Alliance]] voted to boycott the national elections under the No Land! No House! No Vote!

The 2010 FIFA World Cup was connected to a large number of evictions in South Africa which many claimed were meant to 'beautify the city'.&lt;ref name="o.seattletimes.nwsource.com"&gt;[http://o.seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/worldcup/2012084369_soccersaf11.html South Africa's poor complain of evictions as country prepares to host World Cup], Sudarsan Raghavan, [[The Washington Post]], 20 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://baystatebanner.com/world19-2008-07-10|title=In South Africa, evicted residents struggle|publisher=Bay State Banner|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913072934/http://www.baystatebanner.com/world19-2008-07-10|archivedate=13 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mondediplo.com/2008/05/13southafrica Le Monde Diplomatique]&lt;/ref&gt; The WC-AEC campaigned against all evictions caused by the event.

==Poor People's Alliance==
In September 2008 the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign, together with [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]], the [[Landless People's Movement]] and the Rural Network (Abahlali baseplasini) formed the [[Poor People's Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2009/01/12/18562116.php The Struggle for Land &amp; Housing in Post-Apartheid South Africa by Toussaint Losier, Left Turn, January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zcommunications.org/znet/viewArticle/21529 'Participatory Society: Urban Space &amp; Freedom', by Chris Spannos, Z-Net, 29 May 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606072510/http://www.zcommunications.org/znet/viewArticle/21529 |date=6 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poor people's alliance refuses electoral politics under the banner '[[No Land!

'''Yngvar Nielsen''' (29 July 1843, [[Arendal]], [[Aust-Agder]] – 2 March 1916) was a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[historian]],  [[politician]], [[geographer]] and pioneer of [[tourism]] in Norway.

==Background==
Nielsen was born in [[Arendal]], [[Aust-Agder]]. He was the son of Norwegian Telegraph Director, [[Carsten Tank Nielsen]] (1818–92) and Alvilde Olsen (1821–1890). Nielsen descended on both father's and mother's side from the established civil and commercial bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Yngvar Nielsen |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Åsmund |last=Svendsen |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Yngvar_Nielsen/utdypning |language=Norwegian |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, [[Jacob Nielsen (born 1768)|Jacob Nielsen]],&lt;ref name=nbl-jacobnielsen&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Jacob Nielsen |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Odd Arvid |last=Storsveen |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Jacob_Nielsen/utdypning  |language=Norwegian |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been one of Christiania's largest lumber dealers and director of the National Bank.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbl-tanknielsen&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Carsten Tank Nielsen |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Harald |last=Rinde |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Carsten_Tank_Nielsen/utdypning  |language=Norwegian |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Nielsen studied philology and took a linguistic-historical degree in 1865. After three years as a teacher at Nissens Latin School (interrupted by several rounds of archival studies in [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]]), he was employed in the [[National Archival Services of Norway]]  (''Arkivverket'') from 1869 to 1978 and at the same time served as librarian at the [[Deichman Library]]. He was appointed manager of the University's Ethnographic Museum in 1877, and the following year he became research fellow in history and geography. In 1880, he completed his philosophical doctorate thesis on the council [[Riksrådet]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Nielsen was an important advisor in Norway to King [[Oscar II of Sweden and Norway]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} He had close connections to the [[Swedish Royal Family|Royal Family]], and was the tutor of the Swedish princes [[Oscar, Prince Bernadotte|Oscar]] and [[Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke|Eugen]] during their stay at the [[University of Christiania]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Nielsen was chairman of the [[Norwegian Historical Association]], and edited the journal ''[[Historisk Tidsskrift (Norway)|Historisk Tidsskrift]]'' from 1903 to 1912.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Together with [[Ludvig Ludvigsen Daae]] he co-edited the journal ''Vidar'' 1887–89.  Nielsen was a board member of the [[Norwegian Trekking Association]] from 1879 and Chairman 1890–1908. In 1879 he released the travel guide ''[[Reisehaandbog over Norge]]'', popularly called ''Yngvar'', which appeared in 12 editions until 1915 and came to play an important role in the spread of tourism.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; His [[guide book]]s were published in [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Probably Nielsen's most important work as an historian was ''Lensgreve Johan Caspar Herman Wedel Jarlsberg'' (three volumes, 1901–1902), his biography of [[Johan Caspar Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg]] (1779–1840). Wedel-Jarlsberg played an active role in the [[Norwegian Constituent Assembly]] at [[Eidsvoll]] in 1814 and was the first native Norwegian to hold the post of [[Governor of Norway]] during the union with Sweden.

==Personal life==
In October 1870, he married Karen Anne Juliane Hedvig [[Wedel-Jarlsberg]] (1847–1927), the daughter of Peder Anker Count Wedel-Jarlsberg (1909–1893). Nielsen was a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] from 1875 and the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]] from 1897. He received Reward Medal from King Oscar II in 1882, was appointed Knight of the [[Order of St. Olav]] in 1894 and received the Commander Cross 1911. He was appointed Knight of the [[Order of the Polar Star|Nordstjärneorden]] and appointed to several other foreign orders.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;
