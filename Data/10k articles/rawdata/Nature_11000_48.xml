'''{{mp|2011 XC|2}}''' (also written [[Astronomical naming conventions#Minor planets|2011 XC2]]) is a [[near-Earth asteroid]] roughly {{convert|60|-|140|m|sp=us}} in diameter that passed less than 1 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]] from Earth on 3 December 2011.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt;

From mid October 2011 until 3 December 2011 15:00&amp;nbsp;[[Universal Time|UT]] the small dim asteroid had an [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] less than 60 degrees from the Sun.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2011"/&gt; (While less than 18 degrees from the Sun any dim asteroid can be lost in [[astronomical twilight]], and many [[Observatory|observatories]] can not see below ~40 degrees from the [[horizon]].) On 3 December 2011 at 15:20&amp;nbsp;UT the asteroid passed {{convert|0.0023|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth and at 16:20&amp;nbsp;UT passed {{convert|0.0016|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from the Moon.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; The asteroid was then discovered on 8 December 2011 by [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] (LINEAR) at an [[apparent magnitude]] of 19 using a {{convert|1.0|m|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[reflecting telescope]].&lt;ref name="MPEC2011-X35"/&gt; At the time of discovery the asteroid was near [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]] to the Sun.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2011"/&gt;

It has an observation arc of 22 days with an [[Uncertainty Parameter U|uncertainty parameter]] of 7.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; Virtual clones of the asteroid that fit the uncertainty region in the known trajectory show a 1 in 455,000 chance that the asteroid will [[Impact event|impact]] Earth on 2 December 2056.&lt;ref name="summary"/&gt; With a 2056 [[Palermo Technical Scale]] of −4.35,&lt;ref name=summary/&gt; the odds of impact by {{mp|2011 XC|2}} in 2056 are about 22387 times less&lt;ref name=math/&gt; than the background hazard level of Earth impacts which is defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact.&lt;ref name="palermo"/&gt; Using the [[Curve fitting|nominal]] orbit, [[JPL Horizons On-Line Ephemeris System|JPL Horizons]] shows that the asteroid will be {{convert|3.8|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth on 2 December 2056.&lt;ref name=Horizons/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28001">The '''2007 Alberta Royalty Review''' was an independent panel, chaired by William M. Hunter, established by the [[government of Alberta]] to review the level of [[resource royalties]] collected by the provincial government from petroleum and natural gas companies. In their final report entitled "Our Fair Share" released on September 18, 2007 the panel concluded that Albertans, who own their natural resources, were not receiving their "fair share" from energy development. Royalty rates and formulas had "not kept pace with changes in the resource base and world energy markets."&lt;ref name="Our_Fair_Share_2007"&gt;{{cite report |title=Our Fair Share: Report of the Alberta Royalty Review Panel To the Honourable Lyle Oberg, Minister of Finance |date=18 September 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2015 |url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/Org/pdfs/RoyaltyReviewPanelfinal_report.pdf |format=PDF |pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AB_Report"&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/Org/Publications/royalty_Oct25.pdf |format=PDF |date=27 October 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2015 |title=The New Royalty Framework |work=Energy Alberta |pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} As a result of the review new regulations came into effect under the Alberta Mines and Minerals Act including the Petroleum Royalty Regulation, 2009,&lt;ref name="AB_PRR_2009"&gt;{{cite law |title=Petroleum Royalty Regulation, 2009 |work=Government of Alberta |year=2009 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Regs/2008_222.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oil_sands_reg_2009"&gt;{{cite law|title=Oil Sands Royalty Regulation, 2009, Alta Reg 223/2008 |url=https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/regu/alta-reg-223-2008/latest/alta-reg-223-2008.html |year=2008 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512190956/http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/regu/alta-reg-223-2008/latest/alta-reg-223-2008.html |archivedate=12 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Natural Gas Royalty Regulation, 2009. The government of Alberta expected to collect approximately $2 billion annually with new royalty formulas implemented in 2009.&lt;ref name="Parkland_Institute_2015_summary" /&gt; Instead of an increase in royalties on oil and gas, Alberta collected $13.5 billion less from 2009 to 2014 with the new formula.&lt;ref name="Alberta Energy" /&gt; There was a flaw in the 2009 New Well Royalty Rate formula which was in effect by May 1, 2011, regarding the royalties on gas which had provided almost 67% of total royalties collected by Alberta prior to 2009. Under the 2009 formula applied to Natural Gas and By-products represented a decrease from the previous fixed rates.&lt;ref name="Alberta Energy"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/About_Us/1704.asp |work=Alberta Energy |title=Natural Gas and By-product Royalties |accessdate=8 May 2015 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this formula gas royalties declined by approximately $5 billion per year and provided only 17% of total royalties.&lt;ref name="Parkland_Institute_2015_summary" /&gt; In 2008 the global price of oil plummeted from an all-time high of $145 a barrel on July 8, 2008&lt;ref name="Hamilton_2009_Brookings" /&gt; to $32 a barrel later in 2008 resulting in "the cancellation of many energy projects" in Alberta. By 2015 several of these oil projects had not resumed.&lt;ref name="Reith_2015"&gt;{{citation |title=Fort McMurray braces for impact of oil price drop: Spectre of coming cutbacks sends a chill over city sometimes called Fort McMoney |first=Terry |last=Reith |work=CBC News |date=17 January 2015 |accessdate=7 May 2015 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/fort-mcmurray-braces-for-impact-of-oil-price-drop-1.2913496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, Alberta collected $2 billion in oil sands royalties in the post-2009 period with the new rate of 20% compared to $1.5 billion from 2004-2009 with the old rate of 15%.&lt;ref name="Parkland_Institute_2015_summary" /&gt;

== Background ==
In areas [[Surveying|surveyed]] and [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]]ed early in Alberta's history all [[mineral rights|sub-soil resource rights]] belong to the land owner, but in the areas surveyed later or in the massive [[crown land]] areas of the [[Northern Alberta|northern half of the province]] where the current productive [[oil field]]s are located, [[the Crown]], represented by the provincial government, owns all sub-soil resources.

Unlike many other oil-producing jurisdictions such as Saudi Arabia or Norway, Alberta does not have a [[National Oil Company|government oil company]] that owns and exploits all petroleum resources.  Instead privately owned oil companies of various sizes, from inside and outside Canada are encouraged to drill for oil and gas or mine [[oilsands]] on Crown land, and in exchange pay a royalty.

In 1930, the [[Natural Resources Acts|Natural Resources Transfer Act]], shifted control of natural resources in Alberta from the federal government to the provincial government.&lt;ref name="Varcoe_2014"&gt;{{cite news |title=When politics and oil collide |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/business/When+politics+collide/9846093/story.html |first=Chris |last=Varcoe |date=15 May 2014 |work=Calgary Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royalty rates===

In 1931 the Alberta government set the royalty rate at five per cent on oil and gas, creating a rift with the oil industry.&lt;ref name="Varcoe_2014" /&gt;

In 1971, soon after winning a majority government for the Progressive Conservatives in 1971, then-premier [[Peter Lougheed]] moved to increase Alberta's share of royalties creating hostilities with the oil industry. At that time the price of oil was rising globally as the influence of the newly formed [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] increased.&lt;ref name="Varcoe_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1984_royalty"&gt;{{cite law|url=https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/regu/alta-reg-166-1984/latest/alta-reg-166-1984.html |work=CanLII |year=1984 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |title=The Oil Sands Royalty Regulation, 1984, Alta Reg 166/1984 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201115858/http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/regu/alta-reg-166-1984/latest/alta-reg-166-1984.html |archivedate=1 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 when the price of oil bottomed at US$10 a barrel, [[Don Getty]], who was premier from 1985 to 1992, responded by providing the oil industry with $250 million in incentives and royalty cuts. By the end of 1986 Alberta had granted another nine-month cut from 12% to 1% in royalties at the Suncor oilsands.&lt;ref name="Lisac_2004" /&gt;{{rp|236}} &lt;ref name="Lisac_2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lisac |first=Mark |editor=Bradford J.

[[Ralph Klein]] lowered royalties during the early 1990s to spur investment in the oil sands that faced an uncertain future with the low [[price of oil]] at that time. In 1997 the Alberta government set a "generic royalty formula for oil sands projects" using the "1% and 25% formula."&lt;ref name="Our_Fair_Share_2007" /&gt;{{rp|11}} &lt;ref name="royalties_1997"&gt;{{citation|title=Oil Sands Royalty Regulation, 1997, Alta Reg 185/1997 |url=https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/regu/alta-reg-185-1997/latest/alta-reg-185-1997.html |work=CanLII |year=1997 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201121015/http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/regu/alta-reg-185-1997/latest/alta-reg-185-1997.html |archivedate=1 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the oil and gas industry represented 23 percent of Alberta's GDP.&lt;ref name="TD_Drummond_2007" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

In 2006, a year before becoming Premier of Alberta, [[Ed Stelmach]] announced his commitment to reviewing royalty rates for the oil sands as well as for conventional oil and natural gas. As Premier in 2007 he tasked then-Minister of Finance Lyle Oberg to lead the Alberta Royalty Review process.&lt;ref name="Pembina_2015" /&gt; By 2007 The oil and gas industry represented 19 percent of the province's GDP.&lt;ref name="TD_Drummond_2007" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

In 2006-7 the oil sands royalty revenue was $2.411 billion. In 2007/08 it rose to $2.913 billion and it continued to rise in 2008/09 to $2.973 billion. Following the revised Alberta Royalty Regime it fell in 2009/10 to $1.008 billion.&lt;ref name="Government_Alberta_2009"&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/Org/pdfs/EnergyEconomics.pdf|format=PDF |page=17 |title=Energy Economics: Understanding Royalties |work=Government of Alberta |date=September 2009 |location=Edmonton, Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} In that year Alberta's total resource revenue "fell below $7 billion...when the world economy was in the grip of recession."&lt;ref name="ODonnell"&gt;{{citation|title=Bitumen bubble’ costing Alberta billions, Redford says |first=Sarah |last=O'Donnell |first2=Keith |last2=Gerein |date=24 January 2013 |url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/business/Bitumen+bubble+costing+Alberta+billions+Redford+says/7869429/story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128023206/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/business/Bitumen%2Bbubble%2Bcosting%2BAlberta%2Bbillions%2BRedford%2Bsays/7869429/story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 January 2013 |publisher=Edmonton Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 the Province of Alberta "expected $13.4 billion in revenue from non-renewable resources in 2013-14.{{sfn|O'Donnell|Gerein|2013}} By January 2013 the province was anticipating only $7.4 billion. "30 per cent of Alberta’s approximately $40-billion budget is funded through oil and gas revenues. Bitumen royalties represent about half of that total."&lt;ref name="ODonnell" /&gt; In 2009/10 royalties from the oil sands amounted to $1.008 billion (Budget 2009 cited in Energy Alberta 2009.&lt;ref name="Government_Alberta_2009" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

In order to accelerate development of the oil sands, the federal and provincial governments more closely aligned taxation of the oil sands with other surface mining resulting in "charging one per cent of a project’s gross revenues until the project’s investment costs are paid in full at which point rates increased to 25 per cent of net revenue. These policy changes and higher oil prices after 2003 had the desired effect of accelerating the development of the oil sands industry.&lt;ref name="Government_Alberta_2009" /&gt;{{rp|1}} "A revised Alberta Royalty Regime was implemented in January 1, 2009&lt;ref name="Government_Alberta_2009" /&gt;{{rp|7}} through which each oil sands project pays a gross revenue royalty rate of 1%.&lt;ref name="DoE_AB_2011"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/Tenure/pdfs/FISREG.pdf|format=PDF|title=Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes: Western Canadian Provinces and Territories|date=June 2011|work=Alberta Department of Energy|isbn=978-0-7785-9423-9|location=Edmonton, Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

The Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes described how royalty payments were calculated:&lt;ref name="DoE_AB_2011" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

{{quote|After an oil sands royalty project reaches payout, the royalty payable to the Crown is equal to the greater of: (a) the gross revenue royalty (1% - 9%) for the period, and (b) the royalty percentage (25% - 40%) of net revenue for the period. Effective January 1, 2009 the royalty percentage of net revenue is also indexed to the Canadian dollar price of WTI. It is 25% when the WTI price is less than or equal to $55/bbl, rising linearly to a maximum of 40% when the price reaches $120/bbl. For royalty purposes, net revenue equals project revenue less allowed costs.|Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes}}

When the price of oil per barrel is less than or equal to $120/ bbl indexed against [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) "payout."&lt;ref name="DoE_AB_2011" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

Payout refers "the first time when the developer has recovered all the allowed costs of the project, including a return allowance on those costs equal to the Government of Canada long-term bond rate ["LTBR"].&lt;ref name="DoE_AB_2011" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

In order to encourage growth and prosperity and due to the extremely high cost of exploration, research and development, oil sands and mining operations pay no corporate, federal, provincial taxes or government royalties other than personal income taxes as companies often remain in a loss position for tax and royalty purposes for many years. Defining a loss position becomes increasingly complex when [[Vertical integration|vertically-integrated]] multi-national energy companies are involved. Suncor claims their realized losses were legitimate and that [[Canada Revenue Agency]] (CRA) is unfairly claiming "$1.2-billion" in taxes which is jeopardizing their operations.&lt;ref name="Vanderklippe_2013"&gt;{{citation | title=Oil differential darkens Alberta’s budget| first=Nathan |last=Vanderklippe| location=Calgary, Alberta| publisher=Globe and Mail| url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/oil-differential-darkens-albertas-budget/article7647602/?service=mobile| date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bitumen Valuation Methodology (BVM) is a method to determine for royalty purposes a value for bitumen produced in oil sands projects and either upgraded on-site or sold or transferred to affiliates. The BVM ensures that Alberta receives market value for its bitumen production, taken in cash or bitumen royalty-in-kind, through the royalty formula. [[Western Canadian Select]] (WCS), a grade or blend of Alberta bitumens, diluents (a product such as [[naphtha]] or [[Natural-gas condensate|condensate]] which is added to increase the ability of the oil to flow through a pipeline) and conventional heavy oils, developed by Alberta producers and stored and valued at Hardisty, AB was determined to be the best reference crude price in the development of a BVM."&lt;ref name="Government_Alberta_2009" /&gt;

By the end of 2001 the price of oil was as low as $20 a barrel. By July 8, 2008 the price of oil steadily increased until it reached an all-time high of $145 a barrel.&lt;ref name="Hamilton_2009_Brookings"&gt;{{citation|first=James D. |last=Hamilton |title=Causes and Consequences of the Oil Shock of 2007–08 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Spring%202009/2009a_bpea_hamilton.PDF |format=PDF |year=2009 |accessdate=7 May 2015 |work=Brookings Institution |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118042130/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Spring%202009/2009a_bpea_hamilton.PDF |archivedate=18 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|215}} Later in 2008 the price of oil plummeted to $32 a barrel resulting in "the cancellation of many energy projects" in Alberta. By 2015 several of these oil projects had not resumed.&lt;ref name="Reith_2015"/&gt;

In 2009/2010 the Alberta government collected $6.1 billion in royalties representing a drop of $3 billion.&lt;ref name="Parkland_Institute_2015_summary" /&gt;

According to a 2015 [[University of Alberta]]'s [[Parkland Institute]] report by Jim Roy, who was a Senior Advisor for Royalty Policy for Alberta Energy from 1985 to 1993, from 2010 to 2015 Alberta collected $13.5 billion less in royalty than in the previous five years.  Instead of getting the expected $2 billion per year increase, Alberta saw a $3 billion per year decrease.  The decrease was composed of a $5 billion per year decrease in gas royalty partially offset by increases in oil royalty and oil sands royalty.&lt;ref name="Parkland_Institute_2015_summary"&gt;{{citation |url=http://parklandinstitute.ca/research/summary/billions_forgone |title=Billions Forgone: The Decline in Alberta Oil and Gas Royalties |first=Jim |last=Roy |work=Parkland Institute |date=23 April 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The total value of hydrocarbon production was about the same during each five-year period.

From October 2009 to 2013/14 bitumen and crude oil royalties "averaged $6.2 billion and contributed just under 16 per cent to government revenues on an annual basis."&lt;ref name="Dobson_2015"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.policyschool.ucalgary.ca/sites/default/files/research/alberta-oil-prices-dobson.pdf |format=PDF |title=Peering into Alberta’s DarkeningFuture: How Oil Prices Impact Alberta’s Royalty Revenues |first=Sarah |last=Dobson |accessdate=8 May 2015 |work=School of Public Policy, University of Calgary |ISSN=1919-1138 |series=SPP Research Papers |date=March 2015 |volume=8 |number=14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905225604/http://www.policyschool.ucalgary.ca/sites/default/files/research/alberta-oil-prices-dobson.pdf |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} The Alberta government predicted in its 2014/15 fiscal-year budget that there would be "an annual average of $8.0 billion in bitumen and crude oil royalties over the next three fiscal years (2014/15 to 2016/17) and an increase in the annual share of bitumen and crude oil royalties to over 17 per cent of government revenues."&lt;ref name="Dobson_2015" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

In 2012-2013 $3.56 billion in royalties were collected from the oil sands.&lt;ref name="AB_2013"&gt;{{citation|title=Economic Benefits |work=Government of Alberta |url=http://oilsands.alberta.ca/economicinvestment.html |year=2013 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145457/http://www.oilsands.alberta.ca/economicinvestment.html |archivedate=8 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global price of oil==
Royalty rates on oil in Alberta are based on the price of [[West Texas Intermediate| West Texas Intermediate (WTI)]], the [[benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark in oil pricing]] in North America and the [[underlying]] [[commodity]] of [[New York Mercantile Exchange]]'s oil [[futures contract]]s. [[Western Canadian Select]] is the benchmark crude for Albertan oil.

==Findings==
In a letter addressed to the Alberta Finance Minister in September 2007, the Chairman of the 2007 Alberta Royalty Review Bill Hunter, claimed "Albertans do not receive their fair share from energy development and they have not, in fact, been receiving their fair share for some time."&lt;ref name="Pembina_2015"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.pembina.org/reports/OurFairSharePackag.pdf |format=PDF |date=18 September 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |title=Letter from Bill Hunter to the Alberta Minister of Finance |author=William N. Hunter}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}

The panel's report not only recommended increased royal rates for all three major resources (conventional oil, natural gas, and oilsands) but also insisted that the government had failed to collect royalties already owed.

The recommended rate increase amounted to a 20% increase or an extra $2 billion per year.

==Response==
Some supporters of the oil industry responded to the 2007 Review with concerns that Calgary would become the "Caracas on the Bow" in the province of "Albertastan."&lt;ref name="UofC_2007"&gt;{{citation |title=Special Edition on the Royalty Report |work=Department of Economics, University of Calgary |date=Fall 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |url=https://econ.ucalgary.ca/sites/econ.ucalgary.ca/files/RoyaltyReportEC.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In 2007 the political response was highly polarized, with the parties of the left, the [[Alberta Liberals]] and [[Alberta New Democrats]], criticizing the government for failing to get Alberta's "fair share" and, in effect, subsidizing oil companies at the expense of the public purse.  They failed to make any gains against the Conservatives during the [[Alberta general election, 2008|Alberta provincial general election of 2008]], however, despite a record low turnout caused primarily by traditional Tory supporters staying home.

The highly respected&lt;ref name="Petroleum review"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Institute of Petroleum|year=2008|volume=62|issue=732-743|pages=234|publisher=Cornell University |title=Wood Mackenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt; global&lt;ref name=Oakes&gt;{{cite book|last=Oakes|first=Elizabeth H.|title=Social Science Resources in the Electronic Age: 004|year=2004|publisher=Oryx|isbn=978-1-57356-477-9|pages=187|author2=Mehrdad Ki }}&lt;/ref&gt; energy consultancy, [[Wood Mackenzie]],&lt;ref name=Hogan&gt;{{cite book|last=Hogan|first=William W.|title=The natural resources trap: private investment without public commitment|year=2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-01379-6|pages=448|author2=Sturzenegger, Federico |authorlink2=Federico Sturzenegger }}&lt;/ref&gt; released a study in September 2007, in which they ranked Alberta's 2007 fiscal regime for oil sands as 11th most favourable out of 100 jurisdictions globally. If all of the recommendations of the report [were] implemented, the report indicated "that the oil sand terms would still rank 44 out of 100 countries in terms of attractiveness."&lt;ref name="UofC_2007" /&gt;{{rp|2}} In 2007 the proposed 64% government take remained well below the average government take of 74% calculated by Wood Mackenzie for the other countries in the study (this take included government equity participations in many countries). The Wood Mackenzie study confirms the findings of the Panel in this regard."&lt;ref name="UofC_2007" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

In September 2007, TD Bank Financial Group Chief economist, Don Drummond and Derek Burelton claimed Alberta's economy would continue to thrive.  The TD report expected Alberta's response to the ARR to be "the next major event," TD economists suggested that many of the review Panel's recommendations made economic sense.&lt;ref name="TD_Drummond_2007"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.td.com/document/PDF/economics/special/td-economics-special-db0907-alta-pr.pdf |date=September 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |first1=Don |last1=Drummond |first2=Derek |last2=Burleton |work=TD Bank Financial Group |title=Alberta ready to defy boom bust cycles of the past: TD Economics }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TD_2007"&gt;{{citation |title=TD report says Alberta boom will continue to bloom, no bust in sight |first=Bill |last=Graveland |work=The Canadian Press |location=Calgary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TD_Tiger"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.td.com/document/PDF/economics/special/td-economics-special-db0907-alta-exec.pdf |format=PDF |work=TD Economics |date=27 September 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |title=The Tiger that Roared Across Alberta }}&lt;/ref&gt; TD Economics had designated the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor as Canada's western economic tiger in 2003. From 1993 to 2003, Calgary-Edmonton Corridor "registered explosive real economic growth and population increases, surpassing rates chalked up in the majority of North American urban centres." By 2003 oil and gas royalty revenues were surging&lt;ref name="TD_2003_tiger" /&gt;{{rp|28}} and the Corridor was "the only urban region in Canada to rival U.S. metropolitan areas in terms of both productivity and standard of living."&lt;ref name="TD_2003_tiger"&gt;{{citation |title=The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor: Take Action Now To Ensure Tiger’s Roar Doesn’t Fade |url=http://www.td.com/document/PDF/economics/special/td-economics-special-alta03.pdf |format=PDF |work=TD Economics |date=22 April 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}

== Repercussions ==
The Conservatives partially implemented the panel's recommendations.  This coincided with a fall in oil prices during [[2008 economic crisis]].  Oil and gas companies, especially [[oil junior|juniors]], complained that this hurt their bottom line, and threatened to move out of the province or shut down. In 2008 the global price of oil plummeted from $145 a barrel &lt;ref name="Hamilton_2009_Brookings" /&gt; to $32 a barrel and many energy projects left the province or were shut down in Alberta. Some never resumed.&lt;ref name="Reith_2015" /&gt; Alberta collected $2 billion in oil sands royalties in the post-2009 period with the new rate of 20%.&lt;ref name="Parkland_Institute_2015_summary" /&gt;

The Alberta government announced on March 11, 2010 that royalty rates effective in January 2011, would be rolled back cutting the maximum rate for conventional oil from 50% to 40% of revenues and cutting the maximum rate for natural gas from 50% to 36%.&lt;ref name="CBC_2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2010/03/11/alberta-royalty-changes.html |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=7 May 2010|work=CBC |title=Alberta retreats on energy royalties }}&lt;/ref&gt; The large decrease in royalty starting in 2009 was mostly due to the way the gas formula automatically adjusted to the falling price for natural gas. The government introduced a "new well" incentive that capped royalty to a maximum of 5% during the first year of production.  However, this incentive had no actual effect on gas royalty because the price-sensitive formula has set a negative royalty rate each month since being introduced.  For almost all wells, the royalty formula defaults to the minimum royalty rate of 5%. Those on the right criticized the government for raising royalties and damaging profits in Alberta's most important industry, which they likened the "killing [[The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs]]".  Junior oil companies were instrumental in funding the upstart [[Wildrose Party]] which emerged in the [[Alberta general election, 2012|Alberta provincial general election of 2012]] as the major challenger to the governing Tories, and became the Official Opposition.

The repercussion for royalties was that in 2009/2010, the Alberta government collected 6.1 billion dollars in royalties for the oil and gas sector.  This was a drop of $3 billion.  Over the next five years, Alberta collected $13.5 billion less in royalty than in the previous five years.  Instead of getting the expected $2 billion per year increase, Alberta saw a $3 billion per year decrease.  The decrease was composed of a $5 billion per year decrease in gas royalty partially offset by increases in oil royalty and oil sands royalty.&lt;ref name="Parkland_Institute_2015_summary" /&gt;  The total value of hydrocarbon production was about the same during each five-year period.&lt;ref name="Parkland_Institute_2015_summary" /&gt;

The orbit of the stars in the binary pair is gravitationally coupled to their shape changes, so that the period shows modulations (typically on the order of ∆P/P ∼ 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;) on the same time scale as the activity cycles (typically on the order of decades).&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Applegate |first1=James H. |title=A mechanism for orbital period modulation in close binaries|journal=Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 |date=1992 |volume=385 |pages=621–629|bibcode=1992ApJ...385..621A|doi = 10.1086/170967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Careful timing of eclipsing binaries has shown that systems showing orbital period modulations on the order of ∆P/P ∼ 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; over a period of decades are quite common. A striking example of such a system is [[Algol]], for which the detailed observational record extends back over two centuries. Over this span of time, a graph of the time dependence of the difference between the observed times of eclipses ''versus'' the predicted times shows a feature (termed the "great inequality") with a full amplitude of 0.3 days and a recurrent time scale of centuries. Superimposed on this feature is a secondary modulation with a full amplitude of 0.06 days and a recurrent time scale of about 30 years. Orbital period modulations of similar amplitude are seen in other [[Algol binaries]] as well.&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"/&gt;

Although recurrent, these period modulations do not follow a strictly regular cycle. Irregular recurrence rules out attempts to explain these period modulations as being due to [[apsidal precession]] or the presence of distant, unseen companions. Apsidal precession explanations also have the problem that they require an eccentric orbit, but the systems in which these modulations are observed often show orbits of little eccentricity. Furthermore, third body explanations have the issue that in many cases, a third body massive enough to produce the observed modulation should not have managed to escape optical detection, unless the third body were quite exotic.&lt;ref name="Van Buren"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Buren |first1=D. |title=Comment on the three-body theory for period changes in RS CVn systems |journal=The Astronomical Journal |date=1986 |volume=92 |pages=136–138 |bibcode=1986AJ.....92..136V|doi = 10.1086/114145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another phenomenon observed in certain Algol binaries has been monotonic period increases. This is quite distinct from the far more common observations of alternating period increases and decreases explained by the Applegate mechanism. Monotonic period increases have been attributed to mass transfer, usually (but not always) from the less massive to the more massive star&lt;ref name="Hall_1989"/&gt;

==Mechanism==
The time scale and recurrence patterns of these orbital period modulations suggested to Matese and Whitmire (1983) a mechanism invoking changes in the quadrupole moment of one star with subsequent spin-orbit coupling. However, they could not provide any convincing explanation for what might cause such fluctuations in the quadrupole moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matese |first1=J. J. |last2=Whitmire |first2=D. P. |title=Alternate period changes in close binary systems |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |date=1983 |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=L7–L9 |bibcode=1983A&amp;A...117L...7M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking the Matese and Whitmire mechanism as a basis, Applegate argued that changes in the radius of gyration of one star could be related to magnetic activity cycles.&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"/&gt; Supportive evidence for his hypothesis came from the observation that a large fraction of the late-type secondary stars of Algol binaries appear to be rapidly rotating convective stars, implying that they should be chromospherically active. Indeed, orbital period modulations are seen only in Algol-type binaries containing a late-type convective star.&lt;ref name="Hall_1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Douglas S. |title=The relation between RS CVn and Algol |journal=Space Science Reviews |date=1989 |volume=50 |pages=219–233 |bibcode=1989SSRv...50..219H|doi = 10.1007/BF00215932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that gravitational quadrupole coupling is involved in producing orbital period changes, the question remained of how a magnetic field could induce such shape changes. Most models of the 1980s assumed that the magnetic field would deform the star by distorting it away from hydrostatic equilibrium. Marsh and Pringle (1990) demonstrated, however, that the energy required to produce such deformations would exceed the total energy output of the star.&lt;ref name="Marsh and Pringle"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marsh |first1=T. R. |last2=Pringle |first2=J. E. |title=Changes in the orbital periods of close binary stars |journal=Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 |date=1990 |volume=365 |pages=677–680 | bibcode=1990ApJ...365..677M|doi = 10.1086/169521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A star does not rotate as a solid body. The outer parts of a star contribute most to a star's quadrupole moment. Applegate proposed that as a star goes through its activity cycle, magnetic torques could cause a redistribution of angular momentum within a star. As a result, the rotational oblateness of the star will change, and this change would ultimately result in changing the orbital period via the Matese and Whitmire mechanism. Energy budget calculations indicate that the active star typically should be variable at the ΔL/L&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0.1 level and should be differentially rotating at the ΔΩ/Ω&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0.01 level.&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"/&gt;

==Applicability==
The Applegate mechanism makes several testable predictions:
* Luminosity variations in the active star should correspond to modulations in the orbital period.
* Any other indicator of magnetic activity (''i.e.'' sunspot activity, coronal X-ray luminosity, ''etc.'') should also show variations corresponding to modulations in the orbital period.
* Since large changes in the radius of the star are ruled out by considerations of energetics, luminosity variations should be entirely due to temperature variations.&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"/&gt;

Tests of the above predictions have been supportive of the mechanism's validity, but not unambiguously so.&lt;ref name=Maceroni&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maceroni|first1=Carla|title=Angular Momentum Evolution in Close Late-type Binaries |journal=Turkish Journal of Physics |date=1999 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=289–300 |accessdate=24 May 2015 |url=http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/physics/issues/fiz-99-23-2/fiz-23-2-2-98073.pdf |bibcode = 1999TJPh...23..289M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frasca&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20041007| title = Orbital period variation in close binaries from radial velocity data and magnetic activity cycles| journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics| volume = 429| pages = 309| date = 2005| last1 = Frasca | first1 = A.| last2 = Lanza | first2 = A. F.|bibcode = 2005A&amp;A...429..309F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Applegate effect provides a unified explanation for many (but not all) ephemeris curves for a wide class of binaries, and it may aid in the understanding of the [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] activity seen in rapidly rotating stars.&lt;ref name=Hilditch&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hilditch |first1=R. W.|title=An Introduction to Close Binary Stars|date=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521798006 |pages=175–176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJSADIxyheoC&amp;pg=PA175 |accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Applegate mechanism has also been invoked to explain variations in the observed transit times of [[extrasolar planet]]s, in addition to other possible effects such as tidal dissipation and the presence of other planetary bodies.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16602.x| title = Orbital period variations of hot Jupiters caused by the Applegate effect| journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society| pages = no| date = 2010| last1 = Watson | first1 = C. A.| last2 = Marsh | first2 = T. R.|arxiv = 1003.0340 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2037W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are many stars for which the Applegate mechanism is inadequate. For example, the orbital period variations in certain eclipsing post-common-envelope binaries are an order of magnitude larger than can be accommodated by the Applegate effect, with [[magnetic braking]] or a third body in a highly elliptical orbit providing the only known mechanisms able to explain the observed variation.&lt;ref name=Völschow&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201527333| title = Eclipsing time variations in close binary systems: Planetary hypothesis vs. Applegate mechanism| journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]| volume = 587| issue=34| date = 2016| last1 = Völschow | first1 = M.| last2 = Schleicher | first2 = D.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Asteria''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|s|t|ɪər|i|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀστερία, "of the [[star]]s, starry one") was a name attributed to the following eleven individuals:
* [[Asteria (Titaness)|Asteria]], a [[Titan (mythology)|Titaness]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'', 404ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asteria or [[Astris]], daughter of [[Helios]] and [[Clymene (mythology)|Clymene]] or [[Ceto (Oceanid)|Ceto]], one of the [[Heliades]]. She married the river god Hydaspes (the modern [[Jhelum River]]) and became mother of Deriades, king in India.
* Asteria, one of the [[Danaids]], daughters of [[Danaus]] who, with one exception, murdered their husbands on their wedding nights. She was, briefly, the bride of Chaetus.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 2. 1. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asteria, one of the [[Alkyonides]]. Along with her sisters, she flung herself into the sea and was transformed into a [[kingfisher]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suda]] s. v. ''Alkyonides''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asteria, daughter of Hydeus, was the mother of Hydissos by [[Bellerophon]]. Her son is known for having founded a city in [[Caria]] which was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. ''Hydissos''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asteria, daughter of [[Coronus (Greek mythology)|Coronus]], and [[Apollo]] were possible parents of the seer [[Idmon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 1. 139, citing [[Pherecydes of Leros]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asteria&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 53&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Asterodia]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 939&lt;/ref&gt; mother of [[Crisus]] and [[Panopeus (mythology)|Panopeus]] by [[Phocus]].
* Asteria, daughter of [[Teucer]] and Eune of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 450&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asteria, the ninth [[Amazons|Amazon]] killed by [[Heracles]] when he came for [[Hippolyte]]'s girdle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History'', 4. 16.3 ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/DiodorusSiculus4A.html#16 on-line text])&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asteria, an Athenian maiden who was one of the would-be [[sacrificial victims of Minotaur]], portrayed in a vase painting.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum]]'' 4. 8185 (painting on [[François Vase]])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] gave the name Asteria to one of the characters in his 1765 [[opera]] ''[[Telemaco (Gluck)|Telemaco]]'', though the name did not appear in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' on which the opera was based.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15562">'''Atlantic history''' is a specialty field in [[history]] that studies of the [[Atlantic World]] in the [[early modern period]]. The Atlantic World was created by the discovery of a new land by Europeans, and Atlantic History is the study of that world.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, Bernard. 2005. Atlantic History : Concept and Contours. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2005 &lt;/ref&gt;  It is premised on the idea that, following the rise of sustained [[Europe]]an contact with the [[New World]] in the 16th century, the continents that bordered the [[Atlantic Ocean]]—the [[Americas]], [[Europe]], and [[Africa]]—constituted a [[regional system]] or common sphere of economic and cultural exchange that can be studied as a totality.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Ordahl Kupperman, ''The Atlantic in World History'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Its theme is the complex interaction between Europe (especially [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[France]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]) and the [[Colonial America|New World colonies]]. It encompasses a wide range of demographic, social, economic, political, legal, military, intellectual and religious topics treated in comparative fashion by looking at both sides of the Atlantic. Religious revivals characterized Britain and Germany, as well as the [[First Great Awakening]] in the American colonies. Migration and race/slavery have been important topics.&lt;ref name="O'Reilly, 2004"&gt;O'Reilly, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of Atlantic history typically focus on the interconnections and exchanges between these regions and the civilizations they harbored. In particular, they argue that the boundaries between [[nation states]] which traditionally determined the limits of older historiography should not be applied to such transnational phenomena as [[slavery]], [[colonialism]], [[missionary]] activity and [[economic expansion]]. [[Environmental history]] and the study of [[historical demography]] also play an important role, as many key questions in the field revolve around the ecological and epidemiological impact of the [[Columbian Exchange]].

[[Robert Roswell Palmer|Robert R. Palmer]], an American historian of the French Revolution, pioneered the concept in the 1950s with a wide-ranging comparative history of how numerous nations experienced what he called ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760–1800'' (1959 and 1964).&lt;ref&gt;Edoardo Tortarolo, "Eighteenth-century Atlantic history old and new," ''History of European Ideas'' (2008) 34#4, pp. 369–374.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s Atlantic history has emerged as an increasingly popular alternative to the older discipline of imperial history, although it could be argued that the field is simply a refinement and reorientation of traditional [[historiography]] dealing with the interaction between early modern Europeans and native peoples in the Atlantic sphere.  The organization of Atlantic History as a recognized area of historiography began in the 1980s under the impetus of American historians [[Bernard Bailyn]] of Harvard University and [[Jack P. Greene]] of Johns Hopkins University, among others. The post-World War II integration of the European Union and the continuing importance of [[NATO]] played an indirect role in stimulating interest throughout the 1990s.&lt;ref name="O'Reilly, 2004" /&gt;

==Development of the field==
Bernard Bailyn's Seminar on the History of the Atlantic World promoted social and demographic studies, and especially regarding demographic flows of population into colonial America. As a leading advocate of the history of the Atlantic world, Bailyn has organized an annual international seminar at Harvard designed to promote scholarship in this field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~atlantic/index.html  See] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024191317/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~atlantic/index.html |date=October 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bailyn's ''Atlantic History: Concepts and Contours'' (2005) explores the borders and contents of the emerging field, which emphasizes cosmopolitan and multicultural elements that have tended to be neglected or considered in isolation by traditional historiography dealing with the Americas. Bailyn's reflections stem in part from his seminar at Harvard since the mid-1980s.

Other important scholars are Jack Greene directed a program at Johns Hopkins in Atlantic History from 1972 to 1992 that has now expanded to global concerns. [[Karen Ordahl Kupperman]] established the Atlantic Workshop at New York University in 1997.

Other scholars in the field include [[Ida Altman]], Kenneth J. Andrien, [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]], Trevor Burnard, [[Jorge Canizares-Esguerra]], [[Nicholas Canny]], [[Philip D. Curtin]], Laurent Dubois, [[John Huxtable Elliott|J.H. Elliott]], David Eltis, Alison Games, Eliga H. Gould, [[Anthony Grafton]], [[Joseph C. Miller]], [[Philip D. Morgan]], [[Anthony Pagden]], Jennifer L. Anderson, [[John Thornton (historian)|John Thornton]], [[James D. Tracy]], [[Carla G. Pestana]], [[Isaac Land]], Richard S. Dunn, and Ned C. Landsman.

==Perspectives==
Alison Games (2006) explores the convergence of the multiple strands of scholarly interest that have generated the new field of Atlantic history, which takes as its geographic unit of analysis the Atlantic Ocean and the four continents that surround it. She argues Atlantic history is best approached as a slice of world history. The Atlantic, moreover, is a region that has logic as a unit of historical analysis only within a limited chronology. An Atlantic perspective can help historians understand changes within the region that a more limited geographic framework might obscure. Attempts to write a Braudelian&lt;ref&gt;A reference to  the great classic, ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'' (2 vol 1949) by Fernand Braudel (1902–1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Atlantic history, one that includes and connects the entire region, remain elusive, driven in part by methodological impediments, by the real disjunction that characterized the Atlantic's historical and geographic components, by the disciplinary divisions that discourage historians from speaking to and writing for each other, and by the challenge of finding a vantage point that is not rooted in any single place.&lt;ref name="Games 2006"&gt;Games (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial studies==
One impetus for Atlantic studies began in the 1960s with the historians of slavery who started tracking the flows of slaves from Africa to the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Curtin 91998)&lt;/ref&gt; A second source came from historians of colonial America. Many were trained in early modern European history and were familiar with the historiography regarding England and the British Empire., which had been introduced a century before by [[George Louis Beer]] and [[Charles McLean Andrews]]. Colonialists have long been open to interdisciplinary perspectives, such as comparative approaches.  In addition there was a frustration involved in writing about very few people in a small remote colony. Atlantic history opens the horizon to large forces at work over great distances.&lt;ref name="Games 2006" /&gt;

==Criticism==

Some critics have complained that Atlantic history is little more than imperial history under another name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip D. Morgan, ed.|title=Atlantic History: A Critical Appraisal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jcETDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|year=2009|publisher=Oxford UP|page=35|isbn=9780195320336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Is it perhaps too expansive in claiming to subsume both of the American continents, Africa and Europe, without seriously engaging with them?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy L. Rhoden|title=English Atlantics Revisited: Essays Honouring Ian K. Steele|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9haISuQhOsC&amp;pg=PR19|year=2014|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=19|isbn=9780773560406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian scholar Ian K. Steele (2009) argues that Atlantic history will tend to draw students beyond their national myths, while offering historical support for such 21st century policies as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), the [[Organization of American States]], [[NATO]] (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), the New Europe, Christendom, and even the [[United Nations]].  He concludes, "The early modern Atlantic can even be read as a natural antechamber for American‐led globalization of capitalism and serve as an historical challenge to the coalescing New Europe. No wonder that the academic reception of the new Atlantic history has been enthusiastic in the United States, and less so in Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, where histories of national Atlantic empires continue to thrive."&lt;ref&gt;Ian K. Steele, "Featured Reviews" in ''American Historical Review'' (Dec. 2009) v.114#5, pp. 1405–7.[https://ucsd.academia.edu/JeremyPrestholdt/Books/153761/American_Historical_Review_featured_review_of_Domesticating_the_World_Dorothy_L._Hodgson]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beatrice Willard Alpine Tundra Research Plots''' were established in 1959 along [[Trail Ridge Road]] in [[Rocky Mountain National Park]], [[Colorado]], above the treeline in an alpine [[tundra]] habitat. The plots were used by  [[Beatrice Willard]] of the [[Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research]] at the [[University of Colorado]] from 1959 to about 1999 in a long-term study of the alpine ecosystem.  Willard's dissertation and updates, as well as her book ''Land Above the Trees: A Guide to American Alpine Tundra'' were highly influential in studies of alpine and tundra ecology.  Her recommendations were used by the [[National Park Service]] in its management of the high alpine areas of the park. Willard's work continued after she moved on to other work, and for the last twenty years she made informal visits to the plots.&lt;ref name=nrhpnom1&gt;{{cite web|last=Yost|first=Cheri|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Willard, Beatrice, Alpine Tundra Research Plots|url=http://www.historycolorado.org/sites/default/files/files/OAHP/NRSR/5LR10540-5LR11754.pdf|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=26 August 2011|author2=Davies, Chase|date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two plots. The Rock Cut Plot is at an elevation of {{convert|12110|ft|m}} near the Rock Cut parking area.  The research plot is {{convert|5|ft|m}} by {{convert|20|ft|m}}, within a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} enclosure. A {{convert|3|ft|m}} fence keeps park visitors from disturbing the plot, and is marked by an explanatory sign. An old footpath runs through the plot, and was monitored to establish rates of regrowth on the tundra.  The Forest Canyon Plot is at an elevation of {{convert|11716|ft|m}}, measuring only {{convert|10|ft|m}} square, originally protected by a metal fence. It is close to the Forest Canyon Overlook.&lt;ref name=nrhpnom1/&gt;

The plots were placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 25, 2007.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15967">[[File:Coffee Ring Effect using Coffee Image.png|thumb|Stain produced by an evaporated drop of coffee.]]
In [[physics]], a "'''coffee ring'''" is a pattern left by a puddle of particle-laden liquid after it [[evaporate]]s. The phenomenon is named for the characteristic ring-like deposit along the perimeter of a spill of [[coffee]]. It is also commonly seen after spilling red wine. The mechanism behind the formation of these and similar rings is known as the '''coffee ring effect''' or in some instances, the '''coffee stain effect''', or simply '''ring stain'''.

==Flow mechanism==
The coffee-ring pattern originates from the [[capillary flow]] induced by the differential evaporation rates across the drop: liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Capillary flow as the cause of ring stains from dried liquid drops| journal =[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume = 389| pages = 827–829| year = 1997| doi = 10.1038/39827| bibcode = 1997Natur.389..827D| issue=6653| last1 =Deegan| first1 =Robert D.| last2 =Bakajin| first2 =Olgica| last3 =Dupont| first3 =Todd F.| last4 =Huber| first4 =Greb| last5 =Nagel| first5 =Sidney R.| last6 =Witten| first6 =Thomas A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting edgeward flow can carry nearly all the dispersed material to the edge. As a function of time, this process exhibit a "rush-hour" effect, that is, a rapid acceleration of the edgeward flow at the final stage of the drying process.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14686996.2017.1314776|pmid=28567177|pmc=5439399|title=Suppressing the coffee-ring effect of colloidal droplets by dispersed cellulose nanofibers|journal=Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume=18|issue=1|pages=316–324|year=2017|last1=Ooi|first1=Yuto|last2=Hanasaki|first2=Itsuo|last3=Mizumura|first3=Daiki|last4=Matsuda|first4=Yu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evaporation induces a [[Marangoni effect|Marangoni flow]] inside a droplet.  The flow, if strong, redistributes particles back to the center of the droplet.  Thus, for particles to accumulate at the edges, the liquid must have a weak Marangoni flow, or something must occur to disrupt the flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Marangoni Effect Reverses Coffee-Ring Depositions | journal=[[Journal of Physical Chemistry B]]| volume = 110| pages = 7090–7094| year = 2006| doi = 10.1021/jp0609232 | pmid = 16599468 | issue = 14| author1=Hu| first1=H| last2=Larson| first2=R. G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[surfactant]]s can be added to reduce the liquid's surface tension gradient, disrupting the induced flow.  Water has a weak Marangoni flow to begin with, which is then reduced significantly by natural surfactants.&lt;ref name="SavinoPaterna2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savino|first1=R.|last2=Paterna|first2=D.|last3=Favaloro|first3=N.|title=Buoyancy and Marangoni Effects in an Evaporating Drop|journal=Journal of Thermophysics and Heat Transfer|volume=16|issue=4|year=2002|pages=562–574|issn=0887-8722|doi=10.2514/2.6716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interaction of the particles suspended in a droplet with the free surface of the droplet is important in creating a coffee ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Alternative mechanism for coffee-ring deposition based on active role of free surface| journal =[Physical Review E]| volume = 94| issue = 6 | pages = 063104| year = 2016| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.94.063104 | last1 =Jafari Kang| first1 =Saeed| last2 =Vandadi| first2 =Vahid| last3 =Felske| first3 =James D.| last4 =Masoud| first4 =Hassan| bibcode =2016PhRvE..94f3104J}}&lt;/ref&gt; "When the drop evaporates, the free surface collapses and traps the suspended particles .. eventually all the particles are captured by the free surface and stay there for the rest of their trip towards the edge of the drop."&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2016-12-coffee-ring-phenomenon-theory.html Coffee-ring phenomenon explained in new theory]. phys.org (December 20, 2016)
&lt;/ref&gt; This result means that surfactants can be used to manipulate the motion of the solute particles by changing the surface tension of the drop, rather than trying to control the bulk flow inside the drop.

==Suppression==
[[File:Coffee ring suppression by cellulose.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Stains produced by colloidal mixtures of [[polystyrene]] particles (diameter 1.4 µm) and cellulose fibers (diameter ca. 20 nm, length ca. 1 µm). The polystyrene concentration is fixed at 0.1 wt%, and that of cellulose is 0 (left), 0.01 (center) and 0.1 wt% (right).&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;]]
The coffee-ring pattern is detrimental when uniform application of a dried deposit is required, such as in [[printed electronics]]. It can be suppressed by adding elongated particles, such as [[cellulose]] fibers, to the spherical particles that cause the coffee-ring effect. The size and weight fraction of added particles may be smaller than those of the primary ones.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

It is also reported that controlling flow inside a droplet is a powerful way to generate uniform film; for example, by harnessing solutal Marangoni flows occurring during evaporation.
&lt;ref name="Gencer et al."&gt;Gençer, A.; Schütz, C.; Thielemans, W., Influence of the Particle Concentration and Marangoni Flow on the Formation of Cellulose Nanocrystal Films. Langmuir 2017, 33 (1), 228-234
 http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b03724&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixtures of low [[boiling point]] and high boiling point solvents were shown to suppress the coffee ring effect, changing the shape of a deposited solute from a ring-like to a dot-like shape.&lt;ref name="de GansSchubert2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Gans|first1=Berend-Jan|last2=Schubert|first2=Ulrich S.|title=Inkjet Printing of Well-Defined Polymer Dots and Arrays|journal=Langmuir|volume=20|issue=18|year=2004|pages=7789–7793|issn=0743-7463|doi=10.1021/la049469o}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of the substrate temperature was shown to be an effective way to suppress the coffee ring formed by droplets of water-based [[PEDOT:PSS]] solution.&lt;ref name="SoltmanSubramanian2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soltman|first1=Dan|last2=Subramanian|first2=Vivek|title=Inkjet-Printed Line Morphologies and Temperature Control of the Coffee Ring Effect|journal=Langmuir|volume=24|issue=5|year=2008|pages=2224–2231|issn=0743-7463|doi=10.1021/la7026847}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a heated hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrate, a thinner ring with an inner deposit forms, which is attributed to Marangoni convection.&lt;ref&gt;Patil N.

Langmuir, Vol. 32 (45), Pages 11958–11972, 2016 DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b02769&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of the substrate wetting properties on slippery surfaces can prevent pinning of the drop contact line, which will therefore suppress the coffee ring effect by reducing the number of particles deposited at the contact line. Drops on superhydrophobic or liquid impregnated surfaces are less likely to have a pinned contact line and will suppress ring formation.&lt;ref name="McBride2018"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McBride|first=Samantha|last2=Dash|first2=Susmita|last3=Varanasi|first3=Kripa|date=2018-04-01|title=Evaporative Crystallization in Drops on Superhydrophobic and Liquid-Impregnated Surfaces|journal=Langmuir|volume=XX|issue=XX|pages=XXXX|doi=10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b00049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternating voltage [[electrowetting]] may suppress coffee stains without the need to add surface-active materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eral, H.B. |author2=Mampallil-Agustine, D. |author3=Duits, M.H.G. |author4=Mugele, F. | title=Suppressing the coffee stain effect: how to control colloidal self-assembly in evaporating drops using electrowetting | journal=[[Soft Matter (journal)|Soft Matter]]| volume = 7| pages = 7090–7094| year = 2011| doi = 10.1039/C1SM05183K | issue = 10|bibcode = 2011SMat....7.4954E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverse particle motion may also reduce the coffee-ring effect because of the [[capillary force]] near the contact line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Capillary force repels coffee-ring effect| journal =[[Physical Review E]]| volume = 82| pages = 015305(R)| year = 2010| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.82.015305|bibcode = 2010PhRvE..82a5305W | last1 =Weon| first1 =Byung Mook| last2 =Je| first2 =Jung Ho}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reversal takes place when the capillary force prevails over the outward coffee-ring flow by the geometric constraints.

==Determinants of size and pattern==
The lower-limit size of a coffee ring depends on the time scale competition between the liquid evaporation and the movement of suspended particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Minimal Size of Coffee Ring Structure | journal=[[Journal of Physical Chemistry B]]|volume = 114| pages = 5269–5274| year = 2010| doi = 10.1021/jp912190v | pmc = 2902562 | pmid = 20353247 | issue = 16| author1=Shen| first1=X| last2=Ho| first2=C. M.| last3=Wong| first3=T. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the liquid evaporates much faster than the particle movement near a three-phase contact line, coffee ring cannot be formed successfully.  Instead, these particles will disperse uniformly on a surface upon complete liquid evaporation.  For suspended particles of size 100&amp;nbsp;nm, the minimum diameter of the coffee ring structure is found to be 10 μm, or about 10 times smaller than the width of [[human hair]].  The shape of particles in the liquid is responsible for coffee ring effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Suppression of the coffee-ring effect by shape-dependent capillary interactions | journal =[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume = 476 | pages = 308–311 | year = 2011| doi = 10.1038/nature10344| issue = 7360|bibcode = 2011Natur.476..308Y | pmid=21850105| author1 =Yunker| first1 =P. J.| last2 =Still| first2 =T| last3 =Lohr| first3 =M. A.| last4 =Yodh| first4 =A. G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedebate.com/science-blog/coffee-ring-effect-explained |title=Coffee-ring effect explained |publisher=ScienceDebate.com |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On porous substrates, the competition among infiltration, particle motion and evaporation of the solvent governs the final deposition morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Colloidal drop deposition on porous substrates: competition among particle motion, evaporation and infiltration | journal=[[Langmuir (journal)|Langmuir]]|volume =31| issue=29| pages =7953–7961| year = 2015| doi = 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b01846 | last1=Pack| first1=Min| last2=Hu| first2=Han| last3=Kim| first3=Dong-Ook| last4=Yang| first4=Xin| last5=Sun| first5=Ying}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[pH]] of the solution of the drop influences the final deposit pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Self-Assembly of Colloidal Particles from Evaporating Droplets: Role of DLVO Interactions and Proposition of a Phase Diagram | journal=[[Langmuir (journal)|Langmuir]]| year = 2010| doi = 10.1021/la9047227 | pmid = 20337481 | volume = 26 | issue = 11 | pages = 7833–42| author1=Bhardwaj| first1=R| last2=Fang| first2=X| last3=Somasundaran| first3=P| last4=Attinger| first4=D| arxiv=1010.2564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition between these patterns is explained by considering how [[DLVO interaction]]s such as the [[electrostatic force|electrostatic]] and [[van der Waals force|Van der Waals]] forces modify the particle deposition process.

==Applications==
The coffee ring effect is utilized in convective deposition by researchers wanting to order particles on a substrate using capillary-driven assembly, replacing a stationary droplet with an advancing meniscus drawn across the substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Controlled rapid deposition of structured coatings from micro-and nanoparticle suspensions| journal =[[Langmuir (journal)|Langmuir]]| volume = 20| pages = 2099–2107| year = 2004| doi = 10.1021/la035295j| issue = 6 | last1 =Prevo| first1 =Brian G.| last2 =Velev| first2 =Orlin D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Investigation of the Deposition of Microsphere Monolayers for Fabrication of Microlens Arrays | journal =[[Langmuir (journal)|Langmuir]]| volume = 24| pages = 12150–12157| year = 2008| doi = 10.1021/la801100g| issue = 21 | last1 =Kumnorkaew| first1 =Pisist| last2 =Ee| first2 =Yik-Khoon| last3 =Tansu| first3 =Nelson| last4 =Gilchrist| first4 =James F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Steady-state unidirectional convective assembling of fine particles into two-dimensional arrays| journal =[[Chemical Physics Letters]]| volume = 243| pages = 462–468| year = 1995| doi = 10.1016/0009-2614(95)00837-T |bibcode = 1995CPL...243..462D| issue = 5–6 | last1 =Dimitrov| first1 =Antony S.| last2 =Nagayama| first2 =Kuniaki}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process differs from dip-coating in that evaporation drives flow along the substrate as opposed to gravity.

Orientation is afforded by the system trying to reach a state of maximum packing of the particles in the thin meniscus layer over which evaporation occurs. They showed that tuning the volume fraction of particles in solution will control the specific location along the varying meniscus thickness at which assembly occurs. Particles will align with their long axis in- or out-of-plane depending on whether or not their longer dimension of the particle was equal to the thickness of the wetting layer at the meniscus location.&lt;ref name="Hosein 10479–10485"/&gt; Such thickness transitions were established with spherical particles as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Linli|last2=Wei|first2=Hong|last3=Nagel|first3=Anthony|last4=Wiley|first4=Benjamin J.|last5=Scriven|first5=L.

[[File:Substance.JPG|thumb|Classification of the six eternal substances]]
{{Jainism}}
'''Dravya''' ({{lang-hi|द्रव्य}}) is a term used to refer to a substance. According to the [[Jain philosophy]], the universe is made up of six eternal substances: sentient beings or souls (''[[Jīva (Jainism)|jīva]]''), non-sentient substance or matter (''[[pudgala]]''), principle of motion (''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]''), the principle of rest (''[[adharma]]''), space (''[[Ākāśa (Jainism)|ākāśa]]'') and time (''[[kāla (time)|kāla]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p. 1 of  Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grimes&gt;Grimes, John (1996). Pp.118–119&lt;/ref&gt; The latter five are united as the ''ajiva'' (the non-living). As per the [[Sanskrit]] etymology, ''dravya'' means substances or entity, but it may also mean real or fundamental categories.&lt;ref name="grimes"/&gt;

Jain philosophers distinguish a substance from a body, or thing, by declaring the former as a simple element or reality while the latter as a compound of one or more substances or atoms. They claim that there can be a partial or total destruction of a body or thing, but no substance can ever be destroyed. {{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=15}}

==Jīva (living entity)==
{{Main|Jīva (Jainism)}}
According to [[Jain philosophy]], this universe consists of infinite ''[[jiva]]s'' or souls that are uncreated and always existing. There are two main categories of souls: un-liberated mundane embodied souls that are still subject to transmigration and rebirths in this '' [[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]] '' due to [[Karma in Jainism|karmic bondage]] and the [[Siddha|liberated souls]] that are free from birth and death. All souls are intrinsically pure but are found in bondage with karma since beginning-less time. A soul has to make efforts to eradicate the karmas attain its true and pure form.

10th-century [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] [[Nemichandra]] describes the soul in ''[[Dravyasamgraha]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The sentient substance (soul) is characterized by the function of understanding, is incorporeal, performs [[Karma in Jainism|actions]] (doer), is co-extensive with its own body. It is the enjoyer (of its actions), located in the world of rebirth ([[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]]) (or) emancipated '' ([[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]]) '' (and) has the intrinsic movement upwards.|''Dravyasaṃgraha'' (2)}}

The qualities of the soul are ''chetana'' (consciousness) and ''upyoga'' (knowledge and perception). Though the soul experiences both birth and death, it is neither really destroyed nor created. Decay and origin refer respectively to the disappearing of one state and appearing of another state and these are merely the modes of the soul. Thus Jiva with its attributes and modes, roaming in ''samsara'' (universe), may lose its particular form and assume a new one. Again this form may be lost and the original acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar, Prof. A. Chakravarti (2005). verses 16–21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ajiva (five non-living entities)==
{{Main|Ajiva}}

=== Pudgala (Matter)===
{{Main|Pudgala}}
Matter is classified as solid, liquid, gaseous, energy, fine Karmic materials and extra-fine matter i.e. ultimate particles. ''Paramāṇu'' or ultimate particle (atoms or sub-atomic particles) is the basic building block of all matter. It possesses at all times four qualities, namely, a color (''varna''), a taste (''rasa''), a smell (''gandha''), and a certain kind of palpability (''sparsha'', touch).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=90}} One of the qualities of the ''paramāṇu'' and ''pudgala'' is that of permanence and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its basic qualities remain the same.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, John (1996). p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot be created nor destroyed and the total amount of matter in the universe remains the same.

=== Dharma ===
{{Main|Dharma (Jainism)}}
''Dharma'' means the principles of Motion that pervade the entire universe. Dharma and Adharma are by themselves not motion or rest but mediate motion and rest in other bodies. Without ''Dharma'' motion is not possible. The medium of motion helps matter and the sentient that are prone to motion to move, like water (helps) fish. However, it does not set in motion those that do not move.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adharma ===
Without ''adharma'', rest and stability is not possible in the universe. The principle of rest helps matter and the sentient that are liable to stay without moving, like the shade helps travellers. It does not stabilize those that move.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.11&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Champat Rai Jain]]:{{quote|The necessity of Adharma as the accompanying cause of rest, that is, of cessation of motion will be clearly perceived by any one who will put to himself the question, how jīvas and bodies of matter support themselves when coming to rest from a state of motion. Obviously gravitation will not do, for that is concerned with the determination of the direction which a moving body may take...&lt;ref name = "key"/&gt;}}

=== Ākāśa (space) ===
Space is a substance that accommodates the living souls, the matter, the principle of motion, the principle of rest and time. It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kāla (time)===
{{Main|Kāla (time)}}
''Kāla'' is a real entity according to Jainism and is said to be the cause of continuity and succession. Champat Rai Jain in his book "''The Key of Knowledge'' wrote:&lt;ref name = "key"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|title=The Key Of Knowledge|date=1975|publisher=Today and Tomorrow's Printers|location=New Delhi|edition=Third|url=https://archive.org/details/keyofknowledge|p=520–530}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|...As a substance which assists other things in performing their ‘temporal’ gyrations, Time can be conceived only in the form of whirling posts. That these whirling posts, as we have called the units of Time, cannot, in any manner, be conceived as parts of the substances that revolve around them, is obvious from the fact that they are necessary for the continuance of all other substances, including souls and atoms of matter which are simple ultimate units, and cannot be imagined as carrying a pin each to revolve upon. Time must, therefore, be considered as a separate substance which assists other substances and things in their movements of continuity.|[[Champat Rai Jain]]}} Jaina philosophers call the substance of Time as ''Niścay'' Time to distinguish it from ''vyavhāra'' (practical) Time which is a measure of duration- hours, days and the like.&lt;ref name = "key"/&gt;

==Astikaya==
[[File:Dravya.jpeg|thumb|270px|Chart showing the classification of ''dravya'' and ''astikaya'']]
Out of the six ''dravyas'', five except time have been described as ''astikayas'', that is, extensions or conglomerates. Since like conglomerates, they have numerous space points, they are described as ''astikaya''. There are innumerable space points in the sentient substance and in the media of motion and rest, and infinite ones in space; in matter they are threefold (i.e. numerable, innumerable and infinite). Time has only one; therefore it is not a conglomerate.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the corresponding conglomerates or extensions are called—''jivastikaya'' (soul extension or conglomerate), ''pudgalastikaya'' (matter conglomerate), ''dharmastikaya'' (motion conglomerate), ''adharmastikaya'' (rest conglomerate) and ''akastikaya'' (space conglomerates). Together they are called ''pancastikaya'' or the five ''astikayas''.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Sikdar (2001) p. 1107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes of Dravya==
These substances have some common attributes or gunas such as:&lt;ref name=nemi&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; J. L. Jaini (1927) p. 4 (of introduction)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Astitva'' (existence): indestructibility; permanence; the capacity by which a substance cannot be destroyed.
*''Vastutva'' (functionality): capacity by which a substance has function.
*''Dravyatva'' (changeability): capacity by which it is always changing in modifications.
*''Prameyatva'' (knowability): capacity by which it is known by someone, or of being the subject-matter of knowledge.
*''Agurulaghutva'' (individuality): capacity by which one attribute or substance does not become another and the substance does not lose the attributes whose grouping forms the substance itself.
*''Pradeshatva'' (spatiality): capacity of having some kind of location in space.

There are some specific attributes that distinguish the dravyas from each other:&lt;ref name="nemi"/&gt;
*''Chetanatva'' (consciousness) and ''amurtavta'' (immateriality) are common attributes of the class of substances soul or jiva.
*''Achetanatva'' (non-consciousness) and ''murtatva'' (materiality) are attributes of matter.
*''Achetanatva'' (non-consciousness) and ''amurtavta'' (immateriality) are common to Motion, Rest, Time and Space.

'''Edwards''' (formerly BOC Edwards) is a [[vacuum]] engineering company headquartered in [[Burgess Hill]], in West Sussex in the United Kingdom. The company manufactures and supplies vacuum and abatement equipment used in advanced manufacturing processes. As of January 2014, Edwards is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Atlas Copco|Atlas Copco Group]].&lt;ref name=Atlas&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Edwards equipment and services business was founded by physicist, F.D. Edwards in 1919 in south London.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardsvacuum.com/Corporate/AboutUs/Timeline.aspx|title=Edwards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the business imported vacuum equipment before commencing independent manufacturing in 1939. In 1953 the company relocated its factory and headquarters to Crawley and was later acquired by [[The BOC Group]] in 1968. This move prompted international expansion for the business, particularly across Asia.

In 1997 BOC Edwards was formed with the integration of Edwards vacuum business with BOC electronic gases unit before the BOC Group was itself acquired by [[Linde AG]] in 2006.  Edwards subsequently became independent when it was acquired by CCMP Capital &amp; Unitas Capital in 2007.

On 14 May 2012, Edwards became listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange as a publicly traded company.

In late February 2013 it was announced that Matthew Taylor would be standing down as CEO and was being replaced by independent Board of Directors member Jim Gentilcore effective 1 March 2013.&lt;ref name=ceo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/edwards-group-names-jim-gentilcore-chief-executive-officer-20130226-01683|title=Today's Stock Market News and Analysis from Nasdaq.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 August 2013 it was announced that Edwards had been wholly acquired by Atlas Copco Compressors, becoming the Vacuum Solutions division of Atlas Copco. and Geert Follens was appointed Divisional president. The acquisition was completed in January 2014.&lt;ref name=Atlas/&gt;

Norway is a large energy producer, and one of the world's largest exporters of oil. 
Most of the electricity in the country is produced by hydroelectricity. 
Norway is one of the leading countries in the electrification of its transport sector, with the largest fleet of electric vehicles per capita in the world (see [[plug-in electric vehicles in Norway]] and [[electric car use by country]]). 

Since the discovery of [[North Sea oil]] in Norwegian waters during the late 1960s, exports of oil and gas have become very important elements of the [[economy of Norway]]. 
With North Sea oil production having peaked, disagreements over exploration for oil in the [[Barents Sea]], the prospect of exploration in the [[Arctic]], as well as growing international concern over [[global warming]], energy in Norway is currently receiving close attention.

In 2011, [[Norway]] was the eighth largest [[crude oil]] exporter in the world (at 78Mt), and the 9th largest exporter of refined oil (at 86Mt). It was also the world's third largest [[natural gas exporter]] (at 99bcm), having significant gas reserves in the [[North Sea oil|North Sea]].&lt;ref name=iea&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/kwes.pdf|title=Free publications|website=www.iea.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Norway-ENERGY-AND-POWER.html Norway: Energy and Power], Encyclopedia of the Nations&lt;/ref&gt; Norway also possesses some of the world's largest potentially exploitable coal reserves (located under the [[Norwegian continental shelf]]) on earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eroei.com/content/view/122/45/ 3000 billion tons of coal off Norway's coastline], by R.J. Wideroe &amp; J.D.Sundberg, Energy Bulletin by Verdens Gang, 29 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Norway's abundant energy resources represent a significant source of national revenue. Crude oil and natural gas accounted for 40% of the country's total export value in 2015.&lt;ref name="norskpetroleum.no"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norskpetroleum.no/en/production-and-exports/exports-of-oil-and-gas/|title=Exports of Norwegian oil and gas - Norwegianpetroleum.no|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a share of GDP, the export of oil and natural gas is approximately 17%. As a means to ensure security and mitigate against the “Dutch disease” characterized by fluctuations in the price of oil, the Norwegian government funnels a portion of this export revenue into a pension fund, the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG).&lt;ref name="codemantra.com"&gt;https://imfcp3.codemantra.com/Marketing.aspx?ID=WP9781513503165&amp;ISBN=9781513522890&amp;sts=b&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian government receives these funds from their market shares within oil industries, such as their two-thirds share of Statoil, and allocates it through their government controlled domestic economy.&lt;ref name="codemantra.com"/&gt; This combination allows the government to distribute the natural resource wealth into welfare investments for the mainland. Tying this fiscal policy to the oil market for equity concerns creates a cost-benefit economic solution towards a public access good problem in which a select few are able to reap the direct benefits of a public good. Domestically, Norway has addressed the complications that occur with oil industry markets in protecting the mainland economy and government intervention in distributing its revenue to combat balance-of-payment shocks and to address energy security.&lt;ref name="codemantra.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moe et al.

The externalities engendered from Norway’s activities on the environment, pose another concern apart from its domestic economic implications. Most of Norwegian gas is exported to European countries, 20% of European gas consumption is from Norway, and Norwegian oil supplies 2% of the global consumption of oil.&lt;ref name="norskpetroleum.no"/&gt; Considering that three million barrels of oil adds 1.3 Mt of CO2 per day to the atmosphere as it is consumed, 474 Mt/year, the global CO2 impact of Norway’s natural resource supply is significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=307&amp;t=10|title=How much carbon dioxide is produced from burning gasoline and diesel fuel? - FAQ - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that Norway exports eight times the amount of energy consumed domestically, most of Norway’s carbon emissions are from its oil and gas industry at 30% and from road traffic at 23%.&lt;ref name="codemantra.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Environmental Defense Fund|last2=International Emissions Trading Association|title=NORWAY: AN EMISSIONS TRADING CASE STUDY|date=May 2015|pages=1-11|edition=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address the problem of CO2 emissions, the Norwegian government has adopted different measures, including signing multilateral and bilateral treaties to cut its emissions in lieu of rising global environmental concerns.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

Norway can serve as a role model for many countries in terms of petroleum resource management. In Norway, good institutions and open and dynamic public debate involving a whole variety of civil society actors are key factors for successful petroleum governance.&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland (2018) ‘Introduction: Civil Society, Public Debate and Natural Resource Management’, in Indra Overland (ed.) ''Public Brainpower: Civil Society and Natural Resource Management'', Cham: Palgrave, pp. 1–22.[https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F320656629&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C964ee38a95a940ba9ce908d563e4aacd%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636524756123561129&amp;sdata=uKMtAylgQ0BbzZ%2FWfgqWa0nCoaEtiuwtsdCK0r0D8zs%3D&amp;reserved=0 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320656629]&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== North Sea oil ===
[[File:Oil production Norwegian North Sea.PNG|thumbnail|400px|Source: Norwegian Central Bureau of Statistics]]
[[File:Norway Gas Production.png|thumb|Natural gas production in Norway (red) and natural gas exports (black)]]

In May 1963, Norway asserted sovereign rights over natural resources in its sector of the North Sea. Exploration started on July 19, 1966, when Ocean Traveller drilled its first hole. Initial exploration was fruitless, until [[Ocean Viking]] found oil on August 21, 1969. By the end of 1969, it was clear that there were large oil and gas reserves in the North Sea. The first oil field was [[Ekofisk]], which produced 427,442 barrels of crude in 1980. Subsequently, large [[natural gas]] reserves have also been discovered and it was specifically this huge amount of oil found in the North Sea that made Norway’s separate path outside the EU possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=30|isbn=978-1-107-50718-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against the backdrop of the 1972 Norwegian referendum to not join the [[European Union]], the [[Norwegian Ministry of Industry]], headed by [[Ola Skjåk Bræk]] moved quickly to establish a national energy policy.  Norway decided to stay out of [[OPEC]], keep its own energy prices in line with world markets, and spend the revenue—known as the "currency gift"—in the [[The Government Pension Fund of Norway|Petroleum Fund of Norway]]. The Norwegian government established its own oil company, [[Statoil]], and awarded drilling and production rights to [[Norsk Hydro]] and the newly formed [[Saga Petroleum]].

The North Sea turned out to present many technical challenges for production and exploration, and Norwegian companies invested in building capabilities to meet these challenges.  A number of engineering and construction companies emerged from the remnants of the largely lost shipbuilding industry, creating centers of competence in [[Stavanger]] and the western suburbs of [[Oslo]]. Stavanger also became the land-based staging area for the [[offshore drilling]] industry. Due to refinery needs when making special qualities of commercial oils, Norway imported NOK 3.5 billion of foreign oil in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/energi/Statoil-hemmeligholder-oljeimport-3930507.html |title=Statoil hemmeligholder oljeimport|work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barents Sea oil ===
{{Main article|List of oil and gas fields of the Barents Sea}}
In March 2005, Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Petersen stated that the [[Barents Sea]], off the coast of Norway and [[Russia]], may hold one third of the world's remaining undiscovered oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norway.org/ARCHIVE/policy/speeches/petersenspeech4mar05/ |title= Transatlantic Efforts for Peace and Security |work=Speech to Carnegie Institution, Washington D.C |publisher=Minister of Foreign Affairs, Norway |first=Jan |last=Petersen  |accessdate=2010-08-05 |date=2005-03-05 |quote=The Barents Sea also contains huge energy resources – perhaps as much as one third of the world's remaining undiscovered oil and gas resources are to be found in this area }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 2005, the moratorium on exploration in the Norwegian sector, imposed in 2001 due to environmental concerns, was lifted following a change in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/33494/story.htm |title=Norway Takes Oil Bids For Barents Sea Frontier  |publisher=World Environment News Planet Ark   |first=John |last=Acher |date=2005-11-16 |accessdate=2010-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A terminal and [[liquefied natural gas]] plant is now being constructed at [[Snøhvit]] and, as the [[Arctic ice cap]] shrinks due to global warming, it is thought that [[Snøhvit]] may also act as a future staging post for oil exploration in the [[Arctic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/10/science/10arctic.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=1f4059714b781260&amp;ex=1286596800 |title=As Polar Ice Turns to Water, Dreams of Treasure Abound |newspaper= New York Times |date=2005-10-10 |accessdate=2010-08-05 |first=Clifford  |last=Krauss |first2=Steven Lee |last2= Myers |first3andrew c=  |last3=Revkin |first4=Simon  |last4=Romero  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electricity generation ==
[[File:Raanaasfoss kraftstasjon1.jpg|thumb|The Rånåsfoss power station (98MW) on the [[Glomma]] River. Norway's 1,166 hydroelectric generating stations provide between 98% and 99% of the country's power supply.]]
{{Main article|Electricity sector in Norway}}
Electricity generation in Norway is almost entirely from [[hydroelectric]] power plants. Of the total production in 2005 of 137.8 [[TWh]], 136 TWh was from hydroelectric plants, 0.86 TWh was from thermal power, and 0.5 TWh was wind generated. In 2005 the total consumption was 125.8 TWh.[http://www.nve.no]

Norway was the first country to generate electricity commercially using sea-bed [[tidal power]]. A 300 kilowatt prototype underwater turbine started generation in the [[Kvalsund]], south of [[Hammerfest]], on November 13, 2003. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516055126/http://www.e-tidevannsenergi.com/] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Penman |first=Danny |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4188 |title=First power station to harness Moon opens |publisher=New Scientist |date=2003-09-22 |accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norway and Sweden's grids have long been connected. 
Beginning in 1977 the Norwegian and Danish grids were connected with the [[Skagerrak (power transmission system)|Skagerrak power transmission system]] with a transmission capacity of 500 MW, growing to 1,700 MW in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Lind, Anton. "[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2015/03/12/135148.htm 600 kilometer søkabel skal føre strøm mellem Norge og Danmark]" ''[[Danmarks Radio]]'', 12 March 2015. Accessed: 13 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since 6 May 2008, the Norwegian and Dutch electricity grids are interconnected by [[NorNed]] submarine [[HVDC]] (450 kilovolts) cable with a capacity of 700 megawatts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tennet.org/english/projects/norned_/projectomschrijving.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109154239/http://www.tennet.org/english/projects/norned_/projectomschrijving.aspx |archive-date=2007-11-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carbon emissions ==
Despite producing the majority of its electricity from hydroelectric plants, Norway is ranked 30th in the 2008 [[list of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita]] and 37th in the 2004 [[list of countries by ratio of GDP to carbon dioxide emissions]]. Norway is a signatory to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], under which it agreed to reduce its [[carbon emissions]] to no more than 1% above 1990 levels by 2012.

On April 19, 2007, Prime Minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]] announced to the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]] annual congress that Norway's [[greenhouse gas]] emissions would be cut by 10 percent more than its Kyoto commitment by 2012, and that the government had agreed to achieve emission cuts of 30% by 2020. He also proposed that Norway should become [[carbon neutral]] by 2050, and called upon other rich countries to do likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/smk/Whats-new/Speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/statsminister_jens_stoltenberg/Speech-at-Trafalgar-Square-London/Speech-to-the-congress-of-the-Labour-Par.html?id=463749 |title=Speech to the congress of the Labour Party  |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Norway|date=2007-04-19 |accessdate=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This carbon neutrality would be achieved partly by [[carbon offset]]ting, a proposal criticised by [[Greenpeace]], who also called on Norway to take responsibility for the 500&amp;nbsp;m tonnes of emissions caused by its exports of oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3057439&amp;page=2 {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Wildlife Fund]] Norway also believes that the purchase of carbon offsets is unacceptable, saying "it is a political stillbirth to believe that [[China]] will quietly accept that Norway will buy climate quotas abroad".&lt;ref name="norwaypost.no"&gt;http://www.norwaypost.no/cgi-bin/norwaypost/imaker?id=71002  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092923/http://www.norwaypost.no/cgi-bin/norwaypost/imaker?id=71002 |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian environmental activist [[Bellona Foundation]] believes that the prime minister was forced to act due to pressure from anti-[[European Union]] members of the [[coalition]] government, and called the announcement "visions without content".&lt;ref name="norwaypost.no" /&gt;

In January 2008 the Norwegian government went a step further and declared a goal of being carbon neutral by 2030.  But the government has not been specific about any plans to reduce emissions at home; the plan is based on buying carbon offsets from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/world/europe/22norway.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print |title=Lofty Pledge to Cut Emissions Comes With Caveat in Norway |newspaper= New York Times  |accessdate=2010-06-20 |date=2008-03-22   |first=Elisabeth |last=Rosenthal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carbon capture and storage ===
Norway was the first country to operate an industrial-scale [[carbon capture and storage]] project at the [[Sleipner oilfield]], dating from 1996 and operated by [[Statoil]]. Carbon dioxide is stripped from natural gas with [[amine]] [[solvent]]s and is deposited in a saline formation. The carbon dioxide is a waste product of the field's natural gas production; the gas contains 9% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, more than is allowed in the natural gas distribution network. Storing it underground avoids this problem and saves Statoil hundreds of millions of [[euro]]s in  [[carbon tax]]es. Sleipner stores about one million [[tonne]]s of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sintef.no/Projectweb/IK-23430000-SACS|title=SACS|website=www.sintef.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European plan on climate change''' consists of a range of measures adopted by the members of the [[European Union]] to fight against [[climate change]]. The plan was launched in March 2007, and after months of tough negotiations between the member countries, it was adopted by the [[European Parliament]] on December 2008. The package focuses on emissions cuts, renewables and energy efficiency.

== Timeline ==
'''10 January 2007:''' The European Commission presented a series of proposals setting ambitious targets of greenhouse gases reduction. It announced the EU would commit itself to reducing emissions of developed countries by 30% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2020 in international negotiations. In addition, the Commission planned its commitment to reduce its domestic emissions by at least 20% by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2007:0002:FIN:EN:PDF Limiting Global Climate Change to 2 degrees Celsius – The way ahead for 2020 and beyond], Communication by the Commission to the European Council&lt;/ref&gt;

'''8–9 March 2007:''' The European Council approved of the objectives of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases presented by the Commission on 10 January 2007. As part of a plan of action on energy policy for the period 2007–2009, it also supported the 20-20-20 targets.

'''23 January 2008:''' The European Commission presented the definitive package, including proposals outlined by the European Council. The plan was to be discussed and adopted by the European Council in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/33&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=1&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=fr Memo on the Renewable Energy and Climate Change Package ]&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission also proposed to extend the system of [[emissions trading]], to impose reductions of GHG emissions to economic sectors that are not covered by the system, and to promote renewable energies.

'''13–14 March 2008:''' The European Council agreed on the guiding principles of the package and set an agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/99410.pdf 13/14 March 2008 Presidency conclusions], Brussels European Council&lt;/ref&gt;

'''11–18 December 2008:''' Discussion about the package during the European Council, and definitive adoption of the package by the European Parliament.

'''December 2009:''' World Climate Conference in Copenhagen to find an international agreement to succeed the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change]], which expires at the end of 2012.

== Origin and adoption ==
After the [[Kyoto Protocol]], signed in 1997 by most European countries but expiring in 2012, a [[2008 United Nations Climate Change Conference|new international agreement]] to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases was to be negotiated at Poznan (Poland) and in [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen in 2009]]. To play a leading role in these negotiations, the European Union wanted to develop as quickly as possible a common position in the fight against climate change, and thus implemented its own measures to deal with climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/news/environment/070216_1_en.htm ''Post Kyoto – no let-up on global warming''], European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeting on 8 and 9 March 2007, the [[European Council]] adopted new environmental targets even more ambitious than that of the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/93135.pdf 8/9 March 2007 Presidency conclusions], Brussels European Council&lt;/ref&gt; The plan included the so-called "three 20 targets", but in reality it consisted in four proposals. These aims were:
* To reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 20% by 2020 taking 1990 emissions as the reference.
* To increase energy efficiency to save 20% of EU energy consumption by 2020.
* To reach 20% of renewable energy in the total energy consumption in the EU by 2020.
* To reach 10% of biofuels in the total consumption of vehicles by 2020.

=== Propositions by the Commission ===
After having launched the negotiations on the package by proposing to implement measures to fight against climate change on January 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/news/environment/070309_1_en.htm ''Ambitious targets agreed to reduce global warming''], European Commission, 9 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the European Commission proposed new measures a year later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/news/energy/080123_1_en.htm Boosting jobs and growth through climate action''], European Commission, 23 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The proposals include the three "20 targets" of the previous European Council.

The new guidelines set by the Commission proposed a limit of {{CO2}} emissions by vehicles, to develop capture and storage of {{CO2}}, to invite each member state to reduce their greenhouse gases emissions, and to reform the [[emissions trading|European emission trading system]]. This last proposal was subject to much debate between the member states. The Commission proposed first to extend this system from 2013, and to extend it to all greenhouse gases instead of restricting it to {{CO2}} emissions. It also proposed to extend emission ceilings to more sectors and industries. It finally planned to end free allocation and to switch to paying quotas in 2013 for all power producers, and by 2020 for other industries.

=== Final adoption ===
The plan was concluded rapidly: it was adopted at the [[European Council]] on  11 and 12 December 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/104692.pdf Brussels European Council 11 and 12 December 2008, Presidency Conclusions], Council of the European Union&lt;/ref&gt; and was voted by the [[European Parliament]] one week later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/background_page/064-44005-343-12-50-911-20081208BKG44004-08-12-2008-2008-false/default_en.htm ''EP seals climate change package''], European Parliament, 17 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The initial deadline for the adoption of the package in the Parliament was March 2009. However, protests from some countries arose regarding the modalities for achieving these objectives, notably because of the [[financial crisis of 2007-2009|economic and financial crisis]], which caused tough negotiations between countries.

The European Council of 11 and 12 December 2008 definitively adopted the package, but modified the initial measures. The 27 Heads of State and governments finally agreed to implement the 20-20-20 targets: by 2020, reduce by 20% the emissions of greenhouse gases, increase by 20% the energy efficiency in the EU and to reach 20% of renewables in total energy consumption in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/104672.pdf Energy and climate change – Elements of the final compromise''], Council of the European Union&lt;/ref&gt; As for the auctioning of emission of greenhouse gases, a gradual introduction is scheduled: companies will have to buy 20% of allowances from 2013, 70% in 2020 and 100% in 2027. However, if no international agreement is reached in the next years, the industrial companies most exposed to international competition will benefit free allocation of quotas. Finally, in the sector of electricity, exceptions are envisaged for the new member states until 2020, while the auctioning of all the allowances will be effective from 2013 for other EU members. The package was then submitted to the European Parliament from 15 to 18 December.

== Debates ==
During the negotiations, some member states have expressed concerns about the increase in energy costs caused by the implementation of the package: the increase could be of 10% to 15% by 2020. Above all, several countries were concerned about the supposed consequences of the auctioning of all emissions of greenhouse gases on electricity prices, on the one hand, and above all on the competitiveness of the most polluting industrial companies.

Poland and most new member states, whose  electricity relies mainly on coal, fear that this reform, increasing electricity prices, could undermine their economic growth and their energy security. They wanted to benefit from a derogation allowing a progressive switch to paying quotas, starting at 20% in 2013 to reach 100% in 2020. Poland and the Baltic States also claimed that the package would force them to develop their gas imports from Russia to reduce their GHG emissions, limiting their energy independence. The member states responded by proposing to improve the electrical interconnections of these countries with the European market. In late October, the Prime Ministers of Poland, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania agreed to establish a plan of energy interconnection.

On the other hand, member states disputed on how to avoid the outsourcings of the most polluting industries, subject to competition of rivals from countries with little involvement in the fight against global warming. Germany proposed the allocation of free emission quotas to the most vulnerable (especially steel industry) companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24383">The southern coast of [[Chile]] presents a large number of [[fjord]]s and fjord-like channels from the latitudes of [[Cape Horn]] (55° S) to [[Reloncaví Estuary]] (42° S). Some fjords and channels are important navigable channels providing access to ports like [[Punta Arenas]], [[Puerto Chacabuco]] and [[Puerto Natales]].

==History==
During colonial times, the fjords and channels of [[Patagonia]] were first explored by the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spaniards]]. There were a number of motivations for their explorations, including a desire to Christianize indigenous peoples, to prevent intrusions of any foreign power into territory claimed by Spain, to increase geographic knowledge of the zone, and finally, to search for a [[mythical city]] called [[City of the Caesars]].&lt;ref name=Morales&gt;{{Citation

==Climate and geography==
This route is mostly used by vessels desiring to avoid the heavy seas and bad weather so often experienced on passing into the [[Pacific Ocean]] from the western end of the [[Strait of Magellan]]. The large full-powered mail steamers generally at once gain the open sea at Cape Pillar (at the west entrance of the Strait of Magellan), as experience has shown that time is thus saved to them; but vessels of less engine power, to which punctuality and dispatch is not so much an object as avoiding possible danger, will find the Patagonian Channels the best route.

The general features of these channels are high, abrupt shores, with innumerable peaks and headlands remarkably alike in character, their bold, rugged heads giving an appearance of gloomy grandeur rarely seen elsewhere.&lt;ref name="readersnatural"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=978-0-89577-087-5|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=288–289|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shores are generally steep-to and the channels, for the most part, open and free, while the few dangers that exist are usually marked by kelp. The tides are regular and not strong, except in the [[English Narrows]].

In the case of the two above mentioned and some other fjords, these waterways proved of value as transport lanes when western Patagonia was settled and incorporated into Chile. On the other hand, the fjords have served as a natural barrier preventing north-south land travel in Chilean Patagonia.

==Legal status of the waterways==
[[File:Baselines chile.png|thumb|right|The [[Baseline (sea)|baselines]] of Chile, according to decree 416, define the [[internal waters]] of the Republic]]
All waters between the Chilean [[Baseline (sea)|baselines]] and the continental shoreline are [[internal waters]], according to the Chilean decree 416 of 14 June 1977 based in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], that is, the coastal nation is free to set laws, regulate any use, and use any resource. Foreign vessels have no right of passage within internal waters, and this lack of right to [[innocent passage]] is the key difference between internal waters and [[territorial waters]]. Chile allows the use of the main waterways under maritime authority dispositions for the following navigation lanes (all names in Spanish):&lt;ref&gt;The Chilean Maritime Authority (''Dirección General del Territorio Marítimo y de Marina Mercante''), article 45 of [http://www.directemar.cl/images/stories/Marco_Normativo/Nacional/Reglamentos/tm-008%20140313.pdf Reglamento de Practicaje y Pilotaje] {{Citation

==Transportation==
{{see also|Carretera Austral}}
Since it is impossible to reach all the region by road through Chile, the transport of persons and cargo must be done by road, ship or airplanes according to the public infrastructure provision.

===Ferry lanes===
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}
[[File:Carretera Austral 2012.JPG|thumb|right|Channels, fjords and straits are important waterways for the region, as here in [[Mitchell Fjord]], near [[Villa O'Higgins]]]]
In order to carry significant quantities of persons, vehicles, and cargo directly onto an unimproved shore to supply the islands and coastal region including settlements, the [[ferry]] is the best suited ship type and most of them are basically a cargo boat with no fancy, cruiser-type accommodation, even though they have managed to improve their customer service. There are 150 major ships sailing in the southern regions of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quiénes somos|trans-title=Who We Are|url=http://www.armasur.cl/quienes-somos/|publisher=Armasur|accessdate=12 September 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cruise ship]]s also operate between the main ports of the region and offer a journey that is considered an experience in itself, due to the slow way of entering this magnificent landscape of narrow channels and solitary islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|trans-title=Short cruises and ferry services |title=Kurzkreuzfahrten und Fährverbindungen|url=http://www.chileinfo.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=29|publisher=ProChile Hamburg|accessdate=12 September 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navegaciones por los canales y fiordos del sur de Chile|trans-title=Navigations through the channels and fjords of southern Chile|url=http://www.chileturcopec.cl/zona/punta-arenas/paseos/navegaciones-por-los-canales-y-fiordos-del-sur-de-chile|publisher=ChileTur Copec|accessdate=12 September 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Carretera Austral]] requires the use of three ferries: a 30-minute crossing about {{convert|45|km|mi|sp=us}} south of the start of the highway in [[Puerto Montt]], a 5-hour crossing from [[Hornopirén]] ({{convert|110|km|mi|sp=us}} south of Puerto Montt) to [[Caleta Gonzalo]] and a 50-minute crossing from Puerto Yungay to Rio Bravo, connecting to the final {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} of the highway.

With the exception of [[Chiloé Island]], the region is sparsely inhabited. The main ports are: Puerto Montt, [[Quellón]], [[Chaitén]], [[Melinka]], [[Puerto Chacabuco]], Puyuguapi, [[Puerto Natales]], [[Punta Arenas]], [[Porvenir, Chile|Porvenir]] and [[Puerto Williams]].

South of Chiloé, there are also small ports like [[Villa Puerto Edén]], Bahía Corbeta Papudo on [[Guarello Island]], [[Puerto Bories]], [[Puerto Navarino]], [[Puerto Toro]], and Caleta Eugenia.&lt;ref&gt;This list doesn't include the lakes. Despite the name, Puerto Aisen is not a port.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Isthmus of Ofqui canal project===
{{main|Isthmus of Ofqui}}
[[File:Canal-ofqui.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Negro River flows from near the San Rafael Laguna to the San Esteban Gulf]]
In order to open a direct passage from the [[Moraleda Channel]] to the [[Messier Channel]] without to go out into the open Pacific Ocean to round the [[Taitao Peninsula]], the Chilean Government ordered in 1937 the construction of a [[canal]] from the [[San Rafael Lagoon]] through the isthmus (2,200 m long, 17 m wide, 5 m depth) to the '''Negro River''', that later should be [[Dredging|dredged]] {{convert|25|km|mi}}. 1937 began the work on the ground, under the management of the railways department of the [[Ministry of Public Works (Chile)|Ministry of Public Works]]. Work continued until May 1943 when funds ran out. The map on the right shows the ''Laguna San Rafael'' and the ''Golfo Elefantes'', they are the southernmost part of the [[Moraleda Channel]]. The ''Golfo San Esteban'' can be seen as the northernmost part of the [[Messier Channel]].

===Chacao Channel bridge===
{{main|Chacao Channel bridge}}
The '''Chacao Channel bridge''', also known as '''Chiloé Bicentennial Bridge''', is a planned bridge that is to link the island of [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]] with mainland [[Chile]] crossing the [[Chacao Channel]]. It was one of the several projects that were planned to commemorate the Chile's bicentennial in 2010. If completed as a [[suspension bridge]], it would be the [[List of longest suspension bridge spans|largest such bridge]] in [[South America]].

'''Gaoua''' is a [[market town]] in southern [[Burkina Faso]] known for its superstitious values and customs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
The population, at last estimate, rested at 30,931 (2012 est.) &lt;ref&gt;[http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;des=wg&amp;srt=npan&amp;col=abcdefghinoq&amp;msz=1500&amp;geo=-31 World Gazetteer], Retrieved on June 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
Located in the red earth, green hills, and fast flowing streams of southwestern Burkina Faso, Gaoua is the capital of [[Poni Province]] and forms a sort of capital for the sacred rites and bush lore of the [[Lobi people|Lobi]] peoples. According to local myth, Gaoua was founded when the Lobi migrated across from northern [[Ghana]] where they found the [[Gan people (West Africa)|Gan people]] peoples occupying the territory. As a result, they named the trek across to Gaoua ''Gan-houo'' meaning "route of the Gan people".&lt;ref&gt;Manson, K., Knight, J. (2006), ''Burkina Faso'', p.226, Bradt Travel Guides, The Globe Pequot Press Inc., Retrieved on June 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Attractions in the town include a [[sacred grove]] of trees, the [[Poni Museum]] (''Musée des Civilisations des Peuples du Sud-Ouest'' or ''Musée du Poni'') and [[cave]]s. There is also a [[mosque]] on elevated ground near the centre. The Gaoua Catholic parish Church of the Sacred Heart will be the cathedral for the newly erected Catholic Diocese of Gaoua.&lt;ref&gt;http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/28470.php?index=28470&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobi Goldfields==
Though their ancient home was considered to be [[Takyiman]] in Ghana, the Lobi migrated across the [[Mouhoun River]] as a result of the Dagomba Wars in the [[1770s]].  Thirty years later, the Lobi displaced the Gan at Gaoua.  The French occupied southwest Burkina Faso in 1879, based on the region's reputation for gold, dating back to the era of [[Mossi people|Mossi]] and [[Dyula people|Dyula]] gold traders.  Although primarily farmers, the Lobi did partake of [[gold panning]] around Gaoua, besides Gaoua being on a trade route to the [[Poura]] gold mines further north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gundlach |first1=Cory |title=The river and the shrine: Lobi art and sense of place, MA Thesis |url=https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3029&amp;context=etd |website=Iowa Research Online |publisher=University of Iowa |accessdate=8 November 2018 |pages=56,64-65,98,131 |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wright |first1=J.B. |last2=Hastings |first2=D.A. |last3=Jones |first3=W.B. |last4=Williams |first4=H.R. |editor1-last=Wright |editor1-first=J.B. |title=Geology and Mineral Resources of West Africa |date=1985 |publisher=George Allen &amp; UNWIN |location=London |isbn=9780045560011 |pages=45-47 |ref=gold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hjulströms diagram en.PNG|thumb|right|300px|The Hjulström curve]]The '''Hjulström curve''', named after [[Filip Hjulström]] (1902–1982), is a [[graph of a function|graph]] used by [[Hydrology|hydrologists]] and geologists to determine whether a [[river]] will [[erosion|erode]], [[sediment transport|transport]], or [[deposition (geology)|deposit]] sediment. It was originally published in his doctoral thesis "Studies of the morphological activity of rivers as illustrated by the River [[Fyris]].&lt;ref&gt;Hjulstrom, F. (1935). Studies of the morphological activity of rivers as illustrated by the River Fyris, Bulletin. Geological Institute Upsalsa, 25, 221-527.&lt;/ref&gt;" in 1935. The graph takes sediment particle size and water velocity into account.&lt;ref name=geography&gt;[http://www.geographylwc.org.uk/A/AS/ASriver/seddep.html Sediment transportation]. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211142423/http://www.geographylwc.org.uk/A/AS/ASriver/seddep.html |date=2011-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The upper curve shows the critical erosion velocity in cm/s as a function of particle size in mm, while the lower curve shows the deposition velocity as a function of particle size. Note that the axes are [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]. 

The plot shows several key concepts about the relationships between erosion, transportation, and deposition. For particle sizes where friction is the dominating force preventing erosion, the curves follow each other closely and the required velocity increases with particle size. However, for [[Cohesion (geology)|cohesive]] sediment, mostly [[clay]] but also [[silt]], the ''erosion'' velocity increases with decreasing [[grain size]], as the cohesive forces are relatively more important when the particles get smaller. The critical velocity for deposition, on the other hand, depends on the [[settling velocity]], and that decreases with decreasing grainsize. The Hjulström curve shows that sand particles of a size around 0.1 mm require the lowest stream velocity to erode.

The curve was expanded by [[Åke Sundborg]] in 1956. He significantly improved the level of detail in the cohesive part of the diagram, and added lines for different modes of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imnh.isu.edu/digitalatlas/hydr/concepts/gwater/hjulstrm.htm Hjulström's Diagram]. [[Idaho State University]]. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is called the ''Sundborg diagram'', or the ''Hjulström-Sundborg Diagram'', in the academic literature.

This curve dates back to early 20th century research on river geomorphology and has no more than a historical value nowadays, although its simplicity is still attractive. Among the drawbacks of this curve are that it does not take the water depth into account and more importantly, that it does not show that sedimentation is caused by flow velocity ''deceleration'' and erosion is caused by flow ''acceleration''. The dimensionless [[Shields Diagram]] is now unanimously accepted for initiation of sediment motion in rivers. Much work was done on river sediment transport formulae in the second half of the 20th century and that work should be used preferably to Hjulström's curve.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The ice initially accumulates within small collocated pores or pre-existing crack, and, as long as the conditions remain favorable, continues to collect in the ice layer or ice lens, wedging the soil or rock apart. Ice lenses grow parallel to the surface and several centimeters to several decimeters (inches to feet) deep in the soil or rock.  Studies between 1990 and present have demonstrated that rock fracture by ice segregation (i.e., the fracture of intact rock by ice lenses that grow by drawing water from their surroundings during periods of sustained subfreezing temperatures) is a more effective weathering process than the freeze-thaw process which older texts proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Periglacial weathering and headwall erosion in cirque glacier bergschrunds"; Johnny W. Sanders, Kurt M. Cuffey1, Jeffrey R. Moore, Kelly R. MacGregor and Jeffrey L. Kavanaugh; Geology; July 18, 2012, doi: 10.1130/G33330.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Ice lenses play a key role in [[frost heaving|frost induced heaving]] of soils and fracture of bedrock, which are fundamental to [[weathering]] in cold regions. Frost heaving creates debris and dramatically shapes landscapes into [[patterned ground|complex patterns]]. Although rock fracture in [[periglacial]] regions (alpine, subpolar and polar) has often been attributed to the freezing and volumetric expansion of water trapped within pores and cracks, the majority of frost heaving and of [[bedrock]] fracture results instead from [[ice segregation]] and lens growth in the near-surface frozen regions. Ice segregation results in rock fracture and frost heave.&lt;ref name= Murton2006/&gt;

==Description of the phenomena==

===Common frost heaving===
[[Image:Freezing air ice lens formation.jpg|thumbnail|260px|right| Ice lens formation resulting in [[Frost heaving|frost heave]] in cold climates.]]
[[Frost heaving|Frost heave]] is the process by which the freezing of water-[[Vadose zone|saturated]] [[soil]] causes the [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] and upward thrust of the ground surface.&lt;ref name=Rempel2001/&gt;  This process can distort and crack [[pavement (roads)|pavement]], damage the [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]]s of buildings and displace soil in regular patterns. Moist, fine-grained soil at certain [[temperature]]s is most susceptible to frost heaving.

===Ice lenses in tundra===
[[Image:Ice lens formation in tundra.jpg|260px|thumbnail|left| Ice Lens formation within tundra.]]
Frost heave is common in arctic tundra because the permafrost maintains ground frozen at depth and prevents snowmelt and rain from draining. As a result, conditions are optimal for deep ice lens formation with large ice accumulations and significant soil displacement.&lt;ref name=Peterson2008/&gt;

Differential frost heave producing complex patterns will occur if the correct conditions exist.  Feedback from one year's frost heave influences the effects in subsequent years.  For example, a small increase in overburden will affect the depth of ice formation and heaving in the subsequent years. Time-dependent models of the frost heave indicate that over a long enough period the short-separation perturbations damp out, while mid-range perturbations grow and come to dominate the landscape.&lt;ref name=Peterson2008/&gt;

===Subglacial ice formations===
[[Image:Subglacial_ice_lens_formation.jpg|260px|thumbnail|right| Ice lens growing within glacial till and bedrock beneath glacial ice.]]
Bands of sediment or [[glacial till]] have been observed below Antarctic ice sheets; these are believed to result from ice lenses forming in the debris. In the faster flowing glacial regions, the ice sheet is sliding over water saturated sediments (glacial till) or actually being floated upon a layer of water. The till and water served to reduce friction between the base of the ice sheet and the bedrock. These subglacial waters come from surface water which seasonally drains from melting at the surface, as well as from ice-sheet base melting.&lt;ref name=Bell2008/&gt;

Ice lens growth within the bedrock below the glacier is projected during the summer months when there is ample water at the base of the glacier. Ice lenses will form within the bedrock, accumulating until the rock is sufficiently weakened that it shears or spalls off. Layers of rock along the interface between glaciers and the bedrock are freed, producing much of the sediments in these basal regions of glaciers. Since the rate of glacier movement is dependent upon the characteristics of this basal ice, research is ongoing to better quantify the phenomena.&lt;ref name=Rempel2008/&gt;

==Understanding the phenomena==
[[image:palsaaerialview.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ice lenses are responsible for [[palsa]] (picture) growth]]
The basic condition for ice segregation and frost heaving is existence of a region in soil or porous rock which is relatively permeable, is in a temperature range which allows the coexistence of ice and water (in a premelted state), and has a temperature gradient across the region.&lt;ref name=Dash2006/&gt;

A key phenomenon for understanding ice segregation in soil or porous rock (also referred to as an ice lens due to its shape) is premelting, which is the development of a liquid film on surfaces and interfaces at temperatures significantly below their bulk melting temperature.  The term premelting is used to describe the reduction in the melting temperature (below 0&amp;nbsp;°C) which results from the surface curvature of water that's confined in a porous medium (the [[Gibbs-Thomson effect]]).  Premelted water exists as a thin layer on the surface of ice. Under premelting conditions, ice and water can coexist at temperatures below -10&amp;nbsp;°C in a porous medium.  The Gibbs-Thomson effect results in water migrating down a thermal gradient (from higher temperatures to lower temperatures); Dash states, “…material is carried to  colder regions…” This can also be viewed energetically as favoring larger ice particles over smaller ([[Ostwald ripening]]).  As a result, when conditions exist for ice segregation (ice lens formation) water flows toward the segregated ice and freezes on the surface, thickening the segregated ice layer.&lt;ref name=Dash2006/&gt;

It is possible to develop analytic models using these principles; they predict the following characteristics, which are consistent with field observations: 
* Ice forms in layers which are parallel to the overlying surface.&lt;ref name=Murton2006/&gt;
* The ice initially forms with small microfractures parallel to the surface. As ice accumulates the ice layer grows outward in what is frequently characterized as an ice-lens parallel to the surface.&lt;ref name=Murton2006/&gt;
* Ice will form in water-permeable rock in much the same way as it forms in soil.&lt;ref name=Murton2006/&gt;
*If the ice layer resulted from a cooling from a single direction (e.g., the top) the fracture tends to lie close to the surface(e.g., 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm in chalk). If the ice layer results from freezing from both sides (e.g., above and below) the fracture tends to lie deeper (e.g., 2-3.5&amp;nbsp;cm in chalk).&lt;ref name=Murton2006/&gt;
* Ice forms rapidly when liquid is readily available. When liquid is readily available, the segregated ice (ice lens) grows parallel to the exposed cold surface. It grows rapidly until the [[latent heat of fusion|heat liberated by freezing]] warms the ice lens boundary, reducing the temperature gradient and controlling the rate of further ice segregation.  Under these conditions, ice grows in a single layer which gets progressively thicker.  The surface is displaced and soil repositioned or rock fractured.&lt;ref name= Rempel2007/&gt;
* Ice forms in a different pattern when liquid is less readily available. When liquid is not readily available, the segregated ice (ice lens) grows slowly. The [[latent heat of fusion|heat liberated by freezing]] is unable to warm the ice lens boundary.   Hence the area through which the water is diffusing continues to cool until another ice segregation layer forms below the first layer. With sustained cold weather, this process can repeat, producing multiple ice layers (ice lenses), all parallel to the surface.  The formation of multiple layers (multiple lenses) producing more extensive frost damage within rocks or soils.&lt;ref name= Rempel2007/&gt;
* No ice forms under some conditions. At higher overburden pressures and at relatively warm surface temperatures, ice segregation cannot occur; the liquid present freezes within the pore space, with no bulk ice segregation and no measurable surface deformation or frost damage.&lt;ref name=Rempel2007/&gt;

==Ice lens growth in rock==
{{see also|Frost weathering}}
[[File:Ice Lens Growth on Rocks of the Shore of Lake Superior.jpg|thumb|Ice Formation on coarse shore of Copper Harbor, Upper Peninsula Michigan.]]
Rocks routinely contain pores of varying size and shape, regardless of origin or location. Rock voids are essentially small cracks, and serve as the location from which a crack can propagate if the rock is placed in tension. If ice accumulates in a pore asymmetrically, the ice will place the rock in tension in a plane perpendicular to the ice accumulation direction. Hence the rock will crack along a plane perpendicular to the direction of ice accumulation, which is effectively parallel to the surface.&lt;ref Name=Walder1985/&gt;

Walder and Hallet developed models that predict rock crack-growth locations and rates consistent with fractures actually observed in the field. Their model predicted that marble and granite grow cracks most effectively when the temperatures range from a −4&amp;nbsp;°C to −15&amp;nbsp;°C; in this range granite may develop fractures enclosing ice 3 meters in length in a year. When the temperature is higher the ice which is formed does not apply enough pressure to cause the crack to propagate. When the temperature is below this range the water is less mobile and cracks grow more slowly.&lt;ref Name=Walder1985/&gt;

Mutron confirmed that ice initially forms in pores and creates small microfractures parallel to the surface. As ice accumulates, the ice layer grows outward in what is frequently characterized as an ice-lens parallel to the surface. Ice will form in water-permeable rock in much the same way as it forms in soil. If the ice layer resulted from cooling from a single direction (e.g., the top) the rock fracture tends to lie close to the surface(e.g., 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm in chalk). If the ice layer results from freezing from both sides (e.g., above and below) the rock fracture tends to lie deeper (e.g., 2-3.5&amp;nbsp;cm in chalk).&lt;ref name=Murton2006/&gt;

==Ice sphere formation==
[[File:Ice formation on vegetation.jpg|1280 x 720px|thumb|right|Suspended ice forms into a sphere or tear drop like shape after being repeatedly soaked by waves and frozen by surrounding air.]]
The formation of an ice sphere can happen when an object is about 0.5&amp;nbsp;ft - 1&amp;nbsp;ft above where the water reaches repeatedly. The water will form a thin layer of ice on any surface it reaches. Each wave is an advancement and recession of water. The advancement soaks everything on the shore. When the wave recedes, it's left exposed to freezing temperatures. This brief moment of exposure causes a thin layer of ice to form. When that formation is suspended in the air by dead vegetation or erect objects, the ice will begin to form a sphere or teardrop-like shape. Similar to how a [[condensation nucleus]] forms, the sphere needs a base that is not water. Most commonly on vegetation, the sphere starts as a dot of ice on a branch or stem. As waves soak the shore in water and briefly expose the soaked objects to freezing temperatures, the dot begins to grow as each thin layer wraps itself around the previous layer. Over time, they form spheres or teardrop-like formations

'''Ocean acidification''' threatens the [[Great Barrier Reef]] by reducing the viability and strength of [[coral reef]]s. The Great Barrier Reef, considered one of the [[Wonders of the World#Seven Natural Wonders of the World|seven natural wonders of the world]] and a [[biodiversity hotspot]], is located in Australia. Similar to other coral reefs, it is experiencing degradation due to ocean acidification. [[Ocean acidification]] results from a rise in [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric carbon dioxide]], which is taken up by the ocean. This process can increase [[sea surface temperature]], decrease [[aragonite]], and lower the [[pH]] of the ocean.

Calcifying organisms are under risk, due to the resulting lack of aragonite in the water and the decreasing pH. This decreased health of coral reefs, particularly the Great Barrier Reef, can result in reduced [[biodiversity]]. Organisms can become stressed due to ocean acidification and the disappearance of healthy coral reefs, such as the Great Barrier Reef, is a [[Habitat destruction|loss of habitat]] for several [[Taxon|taxa]].

== Coral health ==

=== Calcification and aragonite ===
Coral is a calcifying organism, putting it at high risk for decay and slow growth rates as ocean acidification increases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aragonite, which impacts the ability of coral to take up CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, decreases when pH decreases.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mongin|first=M|last2=Baird|first2=M.

At this point (sometime in the third quarter of this century at current rates of increase) only a few parts of the Pacific will have levels of aragonite saturation adequate for coral growth. Additionally, if atmospheric carbon dioxide reaches 800 ppm, the ocean surface water pH decrease will be 0.4 units and total dissolved carbonate ion concentration will have decreased by at least 60%. At this point it is almost certain that all reefs of the world will be in erosional states.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Increasing the pH and replicating pre-industrialization ocean chemistry conditions in the Great Barrier Reef, however, led to an increase in coral growth rates by 7%.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/landmark-experiment-confirms-ocean-acidification-s-toll-on-great-barrier-reef-1.19410|title=Landmark experiment confirms ocean acidification's toll on Great Barrier Reef|last=Tollefson|first=J|date=February 2016|journal=Nature|access-date=|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temperature ===
Ocean acidification can also lead to increased sea surface temperature. An increase of about 1 or 2&amp;nbsp;°C can cause the collapse of the relationship between coral and [[zooxanthellae]], possibly leading to [[Coral bleaching|bleaching]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Average sea surface temperature in the Great Barrier Reef is predicted to increase between 1 and 3&amp;nbsp;°C by 2100.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This breakdown of the relationship between the coral and the zooxanthellae occurs when [[Photosystem II]] is damaged, either due to a reaction with the D1 protein or a lack of carbon dioxide fixation; these result in a lack of photosynthesis and can lead to bleaching.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
Ocean acidification threatens coral reproduction throughout almost all aspects of the process.[[Gametogenesis]] may be indirectly affected by coral bleaching. Additionally, the stress that acidification puts on coral can potentially harm the viability of the sperm released. Larvae can also be affected by this process; metabolism and settlement cues could be altered, changing the size of population or viability of reproduction.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Other species of calcifying larvae have shown reduced growth rates under ocean acidification scenarios.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[Biofilm]], a [[bioindicator]] for oceanic conditions, underwent reduced growth rate and altered composition in acidification, possibly affecting larval settlement on the biofilm itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witt|first=V|last2=Wild|first2=C|date=2011|title=Effects of ocean acidification on microbial community composition of, and oxygen fluxes through, biofilms from the Great Barrier Reef|url=|journal=Environmental Microbiology|volume=13|issue=11|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02571.x|pmid=21906222|access-date=|via=|pages=2976–2989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity ==
The Great Barrier Reef is a biodiversity hotspot, but it is threatened by ocean acidification and its resulting increased temperature and reduced levels of aragonite. [[Elasmobranchii|Elasmobranchs]] in the Great Barrier Reef are vulnerable to ocean acidification primarily due to their reliance on the habitat and ocean acidification's destruction of coral reefs. Rare and [[Endemism|endemic]] species, such as the [[porcupine ray]], are at high risk as well.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oceanographic Processes of Coral Reefs, Physical and Biological Links in the Great Barrier Reef|last=Fabricius|first=K. E.|last2=De'ath|first2=G|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=127–144|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larval health and settlement of both calcifying and non-calcifying organisms can be harmed by ocean acidification. A predator to coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef, the [[Crown-of-thorns starfish|Crown of Thorns sea star]], has experienced a similar death rate to the coral on which it feeds. Any increase in nutrients, possibly from river run-off, can positively affect the Crown of Thorns and lead to further destruction of the coral.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Coralline algae]] holds together some coral reefs and is present in multiple ecosystems. As ocean acidification intensifies, however, it will not respond well and could damage the viability and structural integrity of coral reefs. Ocean acidification can also indirectly affect any organism; increased stress can reduce photosynthesis and reproduction, or make organisms more vulnerable to disease. Additionally, as coral reefs decay, their symbiotic relationships and residents will have to adapt or find new habitats on which to rely.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Organisms have been found to be more sensitive to the effects of ocean acidification in early, larval or planktonic stages. As ocean acidification does not exist in a vacuum, the multiple problems facing the Great Barrier Reef combine to further stress the organisms. Not only can ocean acidification affect habitat and development, but it can also affect how organisms view predators and [[conspecifics]]. Studies on the effects of ocean acidification have not been performed on long enough time scales to see if organisms can adapt to these conditions. However, ocean acidification is predicted to occur at a rate that evolution cannot match.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Increasing temperature is also affecting the behavior and fitness of the common coral trout, a very important fish in sustaining the health of coral reefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johansen|first=J. L.|date=2014|title=Increasing ocean temperatures reduce activity patterns of a large commercially important coral reef fish|url=|journal=Global Change Biology|volume=20.4|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indian Ocean]] is home to many literary texts, from [[Greco-Roman]] times to ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', the matrix of many [[narratives]], which portrays [[Sinbad]] the Merchant through a [[fantastic]] and popular twist of the mind, and which is based on real details of navigation in this first ocean of [[globalisation]]. Combining Indian and Chinese literatures, among the oldest on the planet, this can be characterized as the most fictionalized ocean, having been the backbone of many tales, novels and poetic work.

This was further enhanced when [[Bartholomew Diaz]] rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, paving the way for [[Vasco da Gama]], who reached [[Malindi]], before being guided to [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the desired port of [[spice]]s, by a mualim or regional pilot. The Portuguese poet [[Camoens]] then wrote his famous ''Luciads''.

[[Mark Twain]] sojourned there. So did [[Bernardin de Saint Pierre]], who invented the naturalist novel with ''[[Paul et Virginie]]'', an idyllic and tragic [[novel]] under the [[tropics]], in [[Mauritius]]. [[Charles Baudelaire]] also carried his spleen there, experimenting the correspondences and falling in love with [[Creole peoples|Creole]] and [[India]]n ladies, as expressed in his poems "La dame créole" and "A une malabaraise". In [[Réunion]], Rouget Leconte de Lisle is foremost, with symbolist poetry.  

Many more poets went to the [[Mascarene]] islands, like [[Paul-Jean Toulet]].

==Colonial era==

In the colonial era, writers like [[Rabemananjara]] and [[Rabearivelo]] took French to new horizons, combining their original languages and cultures with the colonists' idiom. In [[Réunion]], Marius and Ary Leblond developed the colonial novel, and in [[Mauritius]], [[Clément Charoux]] and Léoville [[L'Homme]] expressed the contradictions of cultures and colours in a colonial environment. 

Preceding the independence period, Mauritian writers like [[Marcel Cabon]], [[Jean-Georges Prosper]], [[Edouard Maunick]], [[Robert Edward-Hart]], [[René Noyau]] and [[Emmanuel Juste]] espoused [[négritude]] or more Mauritian themes.

==Postcolonial era==

In the 1970s, more "sociological" writers such [[Marie-Thérèse Humbert]] expressed the duality of [[multiculturalism]].

Recent Mauritian writers include [[Ananda Devi]], [[Natacha Appanah]], [[Carl de Souza]], [[Shenaz Patel]], [[Barlen Pyamootoo]] and [[Khal Torabully]].

The law creates a new [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=BF72E2C1162C7C49D52DE78D65BEF5B4.tpdila07v_2?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000030934655&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000025503132&amp;dateTexte=20160309 chapter] in the Code of Internal Security aimed at regulating the surveillance programs of French [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], in particular those of the [[General Directorate for Internal Security|DGSI]] (domestic intelligence) and the [[Directorate-General for External Security|DGSE]] (foreign intelligence).

==History==
The Intelligence Bill was introduced to the Parliament on 19 March 2015 by French Prime Minister [[Manuel Valls]] and presented as the government's reaction to the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/infosociety/outcry-over-french-intelligence-bill-313779 | title=Outcry over French Intelligence Bill | publisher=EurActiv | date=15 April 2015 | accessdate=3 May 2015 | author=Robert, Aline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite widespread mobilization, the Bill was adopted with 438 votes in favor, 86 against and 42 abstentions
at the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.is/20150506163503/http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/scrutins/detail/%28legislature%29/14/%28num%29/1109&lt;/ref&gt; and 252 for, 67 against and 26 abstentions at the [[Senate (France)|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.is/20150610142506/http://www.senat.fr/scrutin-public/2014/scr2014-200.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was made into law on 24 July 2015.

Although framed by the government as a response to the Paris attacks of January 2015, the passage of the Intelligence Act was actually long in the making. The previous law providing a framework for the surveillance programs of French intelligence agencies was the [[Wiretapping Act of-1991 (France)|Wiretapping Act of 1991]], aimed at regulating telephone wiretaps. Many surveillance programs developed in the 2000s—especially to monitor Internet communications—were rolled out outside of any legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;Tréguer, Félix. "From Deep State Illegality to Law of the Land: The Case of Internet Surveillance in France," April 2016. https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01306332/document.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 2008, the French government's White Paper of Defense and National Security stressed that "intelligence activities do not have the benefit of a clear and sufficient legal framework", and said that "legislative adjustments" were necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | title=Livre blanc sur la Défense et la Sécurité nationale | author=French government | date=June 2008 | page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main provisions==
This section summarizes the main provisions of the Intelligence Act.&lt;ref&gt;A rough translation of the Act is available at: https://wiki.laquadrature.net/French_Intelligence_Laws&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope===
Through article L. 811-3, the Act extended the number of objectives that can justify extrajudicial surveillance. These include:
* national independence, territorial integrity and national defense;
* major interests in foreign policy, implementation of European and international obligations of France and prevention of all forms of foreign interference;
* major economic, industrial and scientific interests of France;
* prevention of terrorism;
* prevention of: a) attacks on the republican nature of institutions; b) actions towards continuation or reconstitution of groups disbanded (article L. 212-1 of criminal code); c) collective violence likely to cause serious harm to public peace;
* prevention of organized crime and delinquency;
* prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

These surveillance powers can also be used by law enforcement agencies that are not part of the official "intelligence community" and whose combined staff is well over 45,000.

===Oversight===
The existing oversight commission, the ''Commission nationale de contrôle des interceptions de sécurité'', was replaced by a new oversight body called the "National Oversight Commission for Intelligence-Gathering Techniques" (''Commission nationale de contrôle des techniques de renseignement'', or CNCTR). It is composed of:

* four members of Parliament designated by the Presidents of both chambers of Parliament;
* two administrative judges and two judicial judges designated respectively by the Council of State and the ''Cour de Cassation'';
* one technical expert designated by the telecom National Regulatory Authority (the addition of a commissioner with technical expertise was the main innovation).

The CNCTR has 24 hours to issue its ''ex ante'' non-binding opinion regarding the surveillance authorizations delivered by the Prime Minister before surveillance begins, except in cases of "absolute emergency" where it is simply notified of the surveillance measure within 24 hours upon deliverance (article L. 821-3).

For ''ex post'' oversight, the CNCTR has "permanent, comprehensive and direct access to records, logs, collected intelligence, transcripts and extractions" of collected data. It is able to conduct both planned and in the premises where these documents are centralized (article L. 833-2-2). If an irregularity is found, it can send to the Prime Minister a "recommendation" so that she can put an end to it. One hugely significant exception to the CNCTR's oversight powers are the bulk of data obtained through data-sharing with foreign intelligence agencies (article L. 833-2-3).

===Wiretaps and access to metadata===
Techniques of communications surveillance covered by the Act include telephone or Internet [[wiretaps]] (L. 852-1), access to identifying data and other [[metadata]] (L. 851-1), [[geotagging]] (L. 851-4) and computer network exploitation (L. 853-2), all of which are subject to authorization of a renewable duration of 4 months.

===Black boxes and real-time access to metadata===
The Act authorizes the use of scanning device (nicknamed "black boxes") to be installed on the infracturstures of telecom operators and hosting providers. Article L. 851-3 of the Code of Internal Security provides that, "for the sole purpose of preventing terrorism, automated processing techniques may be imposed on the networks of [telecom operators and hosting providers] in order to detect, according to selectors specified in the authorisation, communications that are likely to reveal a terrorist threat.

Another provision limited to anti-terrorism allows for the real-time collection of metadata (article L. 851-3, for terrorism only and for a 4 months period). Initially, the provision targeted only individuals "identified as a [terrorist] threat". After the [[2016 Nice Attack]], it was extended by a Bill of the state of emergency to cover individuals "likely to be related to a threat" or who simply belong to "the entourage" of individuals "likely related to a threat". According to [[La Quadrature du Net]], this means that the provision can now potentially cover "hundreds or even thousands of persons (...) rather than just the 11 700 individuals" reported to be on the French terrorism [[wikt:watchlist|watchlist]].&lt;ref&gt;La Quadrature du Net, "French State of Emergency: Overbidding Mass Surveillance", 21 July 2016. Available at: https://www.laquadrature.net/en/french-state-of-emergency-overbidding-mass-surveillance.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer Network Exploitation===
The Act authorizes [[computer network exploitation]], or computer hacking, as a method for intelligence gathering. Article L. 853-2 allows for:
* access, collection, retention and transmission of computer data stored in a computer system;
* access, collection, retention and transmission of computer data, as it is displayed on a user's computer screen, as it is entered by keystrokes, or as received and transmitted by audiovisual peripheral devices.

Considering the intrusiveness of computer hacking, the law provides that these techniques are authorized for a duration of 30 days, and only "when intelligence cannot be collected by any other legally authorized mean."

The Act also grants blanket immunity to intelligence officers who carry on computer crimes into computer systems located abroad (article 323-8 of the Criminal Code).

===International surveillance===
The Act also provides chapter on the "surveillance of international communications", particularly relevant for the DGSE's surveillance programs. International communications are defined as "communications emitted from or received abroad" (article L. 854-1 and following). They can be intercepted and exploited in bulk on the French territory with reduced oversight. Safeguards in terms of bulk exploitation and [[data retention]] are lessened for foreigners (though the definition of foreigners is technical, i.e. people using non-French "technical identifiers").

===Data retention periods===
For national surveillance measures, once communications data are collected by intelligence agencies, retention periods are the following:
* Content (''correspondances''): 1 month after collection (for encrypted content, period starts after decryption, within the limit of 6 years after initial collection);
* Metadata: 4 years (compared to a 3-year period before the adoption of the Act).

For international surveillance, retention periods depend on whether one end of the communication uses a "technical identifiers traceable to the national territory" or not, in which case the "national" retention periods are applicable, but they start after the first exploitation and no later than six months after collection (article L. 854-8). If both ends of the communication are foreign, the following periods apply:
* Content: 1 year after first exploitation, within the limit of 4 years after collection (for encrypted content, periods starts after decryption, within the limit of 8 years after collection);
* Metadata: 6 years

The law fails to provide any framework to limit staff access to collected intelligence once it is stored by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.

===Redress mechanism===
The Act reorganizes redress procedures against secret surveillance, establishing the possibility to introduce a legal challenge before the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Council of State]] after having unsuccessfully thought redress before the CNCTR.

==Criticism and legal challenges==
During the Parliamentary debate, the bill faced severe criticism from several organizations including [[Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés|National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL)]], [[Conseil national du numérique|National Digital Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nextinpact.com/news/93509-projet-loi-sur-renseignement-tous-points-noirs-denonces-par-cnil.htm | title=Bill on Intelligence: all black spots denounced by the CNIL | publisher=Next Impact | date=19 March 2015 | accessdate=4 May 2015 | author=Rees, Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mediapart]],&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.mediapart.fr/blog/la-redaction-de-mediapart/240415/4-mai-mediapart-organise-les-six-heures-contre-la-surveillance&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Quadrature du Net]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laquadrature.net/en/press-release&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation decrees of the French Intelligence Act are currently undergoing a series of legal challenges by French civil society organizations [[La Quadrature du Net]], [[French Data Network]] and [[Fédération FFDN]] before the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Council of State]].&lt;ref&gt;La Quadrature du Net, 11 May 2016, "Legal Action against the French Surveillance Law".

'''Kainotropite''' is a rare [[vanadate]] mineral with the formula Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;FeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)(VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). It contains trivalent iron. It is one of many fumarolic minerals discovered on the [[Tolbachik]] volcano. The name of its parental fumarole is "Yadovitaya", which means ''poisonous''.&lt;ref name=N&gt;Pekov, I.V., Zubkova, N.V., Yapaskurt, V.O., Polekhovsky, Y.S., Britvin, S.N., Turchkova, A.G., Sidorov, E.G., and Pushcharovsky, D.Y., 2015.

The '''Kazakhstan–China oil pipeline''' is [[China]]'s  first direct oil import pipeline allowing oil import from Central Asia. It runs from [[Kazakhstan]]'s Caspian shore to [[Xinjiang]] in China. The pipeline is owned by the [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] (CNPC) and the Kazakh oil company [[KazMunayGas]].

==History==
The construction of pipeline was agreed between China and Kazakhstan in 1997.&lt;ref name=xinhua1/&gt;  The first section of pipeline from the [[Aktobe]] region's oil fields to the [[Atyrau]] was completed in 2003. The construction of pipeline from {{Interlanguage link multi|Atasu, Kazakhstan|2=kk|3=Атасу кенті|preserve=1}} to Alashankou started in September 2004 and was completed in December 2005.&lt;ref name=peoplesdaily2&gt;

'''Lake Suesca''' is a natural [[water body]] situated on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]], belonging to the municipalities of [[Suesca]] and [[Cucunubá]] in the department of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]], [[Colombia]]. The [[Drainage basin|basin]] has a semi-elliptical shape that extends on a north–south axis, with roughly {{convert|6|km|mi}} length and {{convert|2|km|mi}} width.&lt;ref name=Eloy&gt;{{es icon}} [http://eloyhanoi.com/planes-turisticos-en-suesca-cundinamarca/# Length, width and depth of Lake Suesca]&lt;/ref&gt; The average depth is {{convert|8|m|ft}}. It is located in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]], on the [[anticline|anticlinal]] of [[Nemocón]], in the northeast of the department, at an altitude of {{convert|2800|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="CAR"&gt;CAR, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

=== Geology and soils ===
[[Geology of Colombia|Geologically]], the lake is of [[Pleistocene]] origin and is linked to the formation of the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]], which had a strong uprising activity during the [[Pliocene]]. Because of its location there is a wide distribution of [[sedimentary rock]]s, and the [[Guadalupe Group]], [[Guaduas Formation|Guaduas]], [[Bogotá Formation|Bogotá]] and [[Cacho Formation|Cacho]] [[Geological formation|formations]] are present in the area. The basin is crossed along its axis by the Suesca Fault, uplifting [[sandstone]].&lt;ref name="CAR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bastidas"&gt;Bastidas, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leon"&gt;Leon et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The soils of the basin are classified as [[alfisol]]s, where [[erosion]] areas are classified as "bad soils". Generally these correspond to cold and dry climates, with corrugated relief  and highly evolved soils, where the presence of erosion is common, and most [[Soil horizon|horizons]] have enrichment with clay. These soils were formed during the [[Pliocene]] and [[Quaternary]], containing deposits of volcanic ash from the [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Cordillera Central]], which weathered into clays, currently present in the lower strata.&lt;ref name="Leon"/&gt;

=== Vegetation and climate ===
The original vegetation was composed of [[Weinmannia tomentosa|encenillo]] and "corono" forests, accompanied by more [[Xerophyte|xerophytic]] Andean [[Plant community|communities]], which correspond to the Low montane dry forest (bs-MB) according to the [[Holdridge life zones]]. The actual land cover is dominated by [[Introduced species|exotic species]], mostly ''[[Acacia decurrens]]'', with few remnants of native vegetation in the north and south of the basin.&lt;ref name="Bastidas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leon"/&gt;

From a climatic point of view, the region has a [[Multimodal distribution|bimodal]] rainfall regime, with an annual average of 647&amp;nbsp;mm, average temperatures of 14&amp;nbsp;°C, 70% relative humidity and evaporation of 1331&amp;nbsp;mm/year. The winds are a determinant factor for the vegetation and climate, as they are mainly influenced by [[Bogotá savanna|Sabana de Bogotá]], [[Magdalena River Valley]] and the [[Orinoco|Orinoco Plains]], which converge in the area to generate specific characteristics from the point of view of moisture and the feasibility of rainfall.&lt;ref name="Bastidas"/&gt;

The region is under the jurisdiction of the Corporación Autonoma Regional de Cundinamarca (CAR) (environmental authority) and its central axis (north–south) serves as the boundary between the municipalities of [[Cucunubá]] and [[Suesca]].

=== Muisca sacred lake ===
As with various other lakes on the Altiplano, [[Lake Tota|Tota]], [[Siecha Lakes|Siecha]], [[Lake Guatavita|Guatavita]] and [[Lake Iguaque|Iguaque]], the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] who were the original inhabitants of the area before the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]], performed [[Muisca religion|religious]] rituals at Lake Suesca.&lt;ref&gt;Casilimas &amp; López, 1987, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental issues ==
The basin has suffered severe deforestation and erosion, which together have negatively affected the lake [[ecosystem]], which added to the impact of [[climate change]] have led to a significant reduction of the water surface. Plans for sustainable development are made in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Castellanos Urbina, 2005, p.217&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1970, a [[soil remediation]] process with ''[[Acacia decurrens|Acaia decurrens]]'', ''[[Pinus patula]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]''  was started, but due to the lack of [[Environmental Management|management]], the problems related with [[water scarcity]] due to the reduction of [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and water contained in the soil increased. Nowadays the entire basin is located within a forest reserve that has little management by the authorities.

By [[oral tradition]], it is known that the lake had a great variety of species, such as "Guapucha" ''([[:es:Grundulus bogotensis|Grundulus bogotensis]]'') and "Capitan de la Sabana" (''[[Eremophilus mutisii]]''), now locally extinct due to the [[desiccation]] of the water body and the introduction of carp and trout, which also disappeared by the same effect of [[El Niño]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.alverdevivo.org/red-de-informacion/biblioteca/item/247-capit%C3%A1n-de-la-sabana Fish in Lake Suesca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304235534/http://www.alverdevivo.org/red-de-informacion/biblioteca/item/247-capit%C3%A1n-de-la-sabana |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake is an important stop-over for many [[migratory birds]], but few counting exercises have been made in the area.

'''Liquid latex''' is often used for [[special effects]] [[make-up]] and [[body painting]] applications.  Liquid latex contains about one-third latex, two-thirds water (plus less than one percent ammonia to keep the latex from spoiling and to control the pH of the solution). Liquid latex is sold in jars ranging from 2 oz. through gallon jugs and the consistency is similar to [[Latex paint|latex house paint]]. A four-ounce jar can typically cover an average sized body.  It is typically applied using a disposable sponge and takes about five to ten minutes to dry depending on how thick it is applied.  As it dries it solidifies to a rubbery consistency and in the processes ends up shrinking about three percent.

As the latex dries it becomes very sticky and will stick to itself if accidentally folded over.  Most manufacturers offer a slick spray for latex once it is dry to take away the stickiness allowing the movement of the model's limbs.  Alternatively, shimmer powders can be dusted over dried liquid latex to create metallic effects.  One advantage to the tackiness of liquid latex is that it can act as an [[adhesive]] to attach things to the paint, such as [[zipper]]s.

Unlike most other body and [[face paint]]s, liquid latex is removed by peeling it off since water does not reactivate it.  Peeling the latex from the skin can be painful to some people and does tend to pull body hairs out similar to waxing.  Even though latex is non-toxic, some people can have an [[allergic reaction]]. The most severe of these happen immediately and are categorised as an immediate [[hypersensitivity]] reaction. Cosmetic liquid latex contains approximately 0.3% ammonia to increase shelf-life. Craft and mould making latex can contain more than double this amount and as a result has a much stronger odour. The fumes from the ammonia in liquid latex can irritate the eyes when used as special effect make up on the face. For this reason it is recommended that liquid latex be allowed to vent for several minutes before being applied in this way. Appropriate liquid latex safety guidelines &lt;ref&gt;Liquidflesh.com&lt;/ref&gt; should be followed before the cosmetic use of liquid latex.

Latex is a natural ingredient that comes from [[rubber tree]]s in the form of a milky liquid. There are thousands of species of plants that produce different types of latex, including the [[Chicle]] tree that yields the raw material for producing the rubbery material in [[chewing gum]]. Unlike some rubber compounds, rubber tree latex is non-toxic in both its liquid and solid states, and because of this it can be found in many products such as [[surgical gloves]], [[condom]]s and body paint.  Liquid latex is naturally clear and then dries into a translucent amber color.  Manufacturers add pigments to the product to provide opaque paint choices of multiple colors.  The color of the paint in the jar may initially look chalky, but as it dries it develops into a rich color (grey becomes black for example).  Additional [[acrylic paint]]s can be mixed with the liquid latex solution for custom colors but may not be suitable for use a cosmetic application.

Liquid latex used for special effect make-up projects like scars and gashes incorporate flesh colored latex that is applied to the skin and then built up using materials such as [[tissue paper]] and [[cotton]].

[[File:Madame Jeanette and other chillies.jpg|thumb|[[Bird's eye chili|Bird's eye]] (green), '[[Madame Jeanette]]' (yellow), and [[cayenne pepper]]s (red)]]
This is a '''list of ''Capsicum'' cultivars''' belonging to the five major [[species]] of cultivated peppers (genus ''[[Capsicum]]''): ''[[Capsicum annuum|C. annuum]], [[Capsicum chinense|C. chinense]], [[Capsicum baccatum|C. baccatum]], [[Capsicum frutescens|C. frutescens]], and [[Capsicum pubescens|C. pubescens]].'' Due to the large and changing number of [[cultivar]]s, and the variation of cultivar namings in different regions, this list only gives a few examples of the estimated 50,000 pepper varieties that exist.

== ''Capsicum'' species ==
There are perhaps fifty thousand ''Capsicum'' [[cultivar]]s grown worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=introducing the capsicum to the world|url=http://www.worldofchillies.com/Chilli-plant-varieties/growing-chilli-plants.html|website=World Of Chillies|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Plant Germplasm System|USDA-ARS GRIN]] seed collection contains 6,200 ''[[Capsicum]]'' accessions alone, which include 4000 ''[[Capsicum annuum]]'' accessions. The other ''Capsicum'' species in the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[germplasm]] [[Gene bank|repository]] include: ''[[Capsicum chinense|C. chinense]], [[Capsicum baccatum|C. baccatum]], [[Capsicum frutescens|C. frutescens]], [[Capsicum pubescens|C. pubescens]], [[Capsicum cardenasii|C. cardenasii]], [[Capsicum chacoense|C. chacoense]], C. flexuosum, [[Capsicum eximium|C. eximium]], [[Capsicum rhomboideum|C. rhomboideum]], C. galapagoense,'' and ''C. tovarii.'' &lt;ref&gt;USDA-ARS GRIN pepper seed collection, Experiment, Georgia&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five major species of cultivated ''[[Capsicum]]'', ''[[Capsicum annuum|C. annuum]], [[Capsicum chinense|C. chinense]], [[Capsicum baccatum|C. baccatum]], [[Capsicum frutescens|C. frutescens]], [[Capsicum pubescens|C. pubescens]],'' and within those species are several "[[taxonomic rank|taxonomic]] [[Variety (botany)|varieties]]". Because of the ability of many of species to cross and generate inter-specific hybrids, albeit with low success, there are also what is referred to as "complexes" within the genus ''Capsicum'' of closely related and sexually compatible species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jarret|first=Robert L.|title=DNA Barcoding in a Crop Genebank: The Capsicum annuum Species Complex|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228375272|journal=The Open Biology Journal|volume=1|issue=1|pages=35–42|doi=10.2174/1874196700801010035|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the ''Capsicum annuum complex,'' which consists of ''C. annuum, C. frutescens,'' and ''C. chinense''.

=== ''Capsicum'' types ===
[[File:Arrangement of jalapeño, banana, cayenne, chili, and habanero peppers.jpg|thumb|An assortment of [[jalapeño]], [[banana pepper|banana]], [[Cayenne pepper|cayenne]], [[chili pepper|chili]], and [[habanero]] peppers]]
There are several different general types typically based on shape, intended use and pungency level. Some general types include:
* [[Poblano|Ancho / Poblano]] - These are the same type. They differ in whether the fruit is eaten fresh or dried.
* [[Bell pepper|Bell Pepper]] - One of the most common sweet peppers.
* [[Cascabel chili|Cascabel]]
* [[Cayenne pepper|Cayenne]] - Popular in [[Cajun cuisine]].
* [[Chiltepin]]s or Small Hots
* [['Fresno Chili' pepper|Fresno Chili]]
* [[Hungarian wax pepper]]
* [[Jalapeño]] - Popular in [[Texas]] and [[Tex-Mex]] cooking.
* [[New Mexico chile]] - Popular in [[New Mexico]], but also throughout the [[Southwestern United States]], [[Northern Mexico|El Norte]], and the [[Valley of Mexico]]. Typically referred to as red or green chile in [[New Mexican cuisine]]. Includes [[Hatch, New Mexico|Hatch]], Rio Grande, Española, Big Jim, Sandia, Anaheim, 6-4, and other varieties.
* [[Pasilla]]
* [[Pimiento]]
* [[Serrano pepper|Serrano]] - Popular in [[Puebla]] and [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].
* [[Shishito]] - Popular in [[East Asia]], called a groundcherry pepper in [[Korean cuisine]].

== Cultivars ==
The species and varieties include many economically important [[cultivar]]s with different shapes, colors, and flavors that are grown for different purposes, such as spices, vegetables, and herbal medicines. Some confusion has resulted from the legal term "[[Plant variety (law)|plant variety]]", which is used interchangeably with "cultivar" (not with "taxonomic variety"). The terminology around a cultivar also includes terms such as heirloom, open-pollinated, self-pollinated, and hybrid.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/how-are-hybrid-and-open-pollinated-vegetables-different|title=How are hybrid and open-pollinated vegetables different? {{!}} Oregon State University Extension Service {{!}} Gardening|website=extension.oregonstate.edu|access-date=2016-04-01|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heirloom varieties]] are typically those that have been selected and grown historically with seed saved every year, and are still maintained today in similar fashion, such as the blocky-type California Wonder. [[Open-pollinated]] varieties are those that are maintained without strict barriers to prevent [[Outcrossing|out-crossing]] and then seed is collected at and stored from each harvest such as the lamuyo-type  Marconi Yellow. While open-pollinated varieties are typically [[True to type|true-to-type]], there may be occasional [[Outcrossing|out-crossing]] to other ''Capsicum'' varieties that may introduce some [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]]. [[Self-pollination|Self-pollinated]] varieties are similar to open-pollinated varieties in that they are true-to-type and seed is collected at and stored from each harvest, but measures are taken to minimize out-crossing. This may involve placing a barrier such as a mesh bag or cage over the plant to prevent [[pollinator]]s from reaching flowers, ensuring that the plant has "[[Vegetative reproduction|selfed]]". This is how much seed intended for home-garden use is produced, like the cultivar Early Jalapeño.  These three types of cultivar seed production are all similar in that only one parent is used and the seed are produced generally through [[Self-pollination|selfing]].

[[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] varieties take advantage of a phenomenon called [[heterosis]] or [[Hybrid Vigor|hybrid vigor]], which occurs in pepper. To generate a hybrid variety, two self-pollinated varieties are intentionally crossed, and all seed from this cross are collected. The new hybrid variety typically is more vigorous than either of the two parents contributing to traits such as higher yield.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hybrid seed if saved will not produce a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]] set of plants the next generation, meaning that the two parents will need to be crossed again to generate more hybrid seed. This method is used to produce hybrid ''Capsicum'' cultivars such as the blocky-types Double-Up and Orange Blaze. Much of the commercial pepper production uses hybrid varieties for their improved traits.

===''Capsicum annuum''===
{{main| Capsicum annuum}}
''Capsicum annuum'', native from southern [[North America]] through [[Central America]] to [[South America]], has been cultivated worldwide for over 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCbkCgAAQBAJ|title=The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492, 30th Anniversary Edition|last=Jr|first=Alfred W. Crosby|date=2003-04-30|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313095399|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its forms are varied, from large to small, sweet to sour, and very hot/pungent to bland. Despite being a single species, ''C. annuum'' has many forms, with a variety of names, even in the same language. Official names aside, in [[American English]], any variety lacking heat is colloquially known as a [[sweet pepper]], and those sweet peppers that have a blocky-shape are referred to as [[bell pepper]]s. A variety that produces [[capsaicin]] is colloquially known as a [[hot pepper]] or [[chili pepper]].  In [[British English]], the sweet varieties are called "peppers"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waitrose.com/food/cookingandrecipes/cookinglibraries/glossary/glossary.aspx?type=0&amp;id=250 |title=Pepper - Glossary - Cooking libraries - Cooking and recipes - Food &amp; drink |publisher=Waitrose.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the hot varieties "chillies",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waitrose.com/food/cookingandrecipes/cookinglibraries/glossary/glossary.aspx?type=0&amp;id=92 |title=Chilli - Glossary - Cooking libraries - Cooking and recipes - Food &amp; drink |publisher=Waitrose.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in [[Australian English]], the name "capsicum" is commonly used for bell peppers exclusively and "chilli" is often used to encompass the hotter varieties.

The plant is a tender [[perennial]] [[subshrub]], with a densely branched stem.  The plant reaches 0.5&amp;ndash;1.5 m (20&amp;ndash;60 in). Single white flowers develop into the fruit, which is typically green when unripe, but may lack chlorophyll causing a white color, changing usually to red, although some varieties may ripen to yellow, orange, peach, brown, or purple. The species  are grown in temperate climates as an [[annual plant|annual]], but they are especially productive in warm and dry climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxJP5iknOToC|title=Protected Cultivation in the Mediterranean Climate|last=Nations|first=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Food &amp; Agriculture Org.|isbn=9789251027196|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Capsicum chinense''===
{{main| Capsicum chinense}}

''Capsicum chinense'' or "Chinese capsicum" is a misnomer since all ''Capsicum'' species originated in the [[New World]]. [[Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin]] (1727–1817), a Dutch [[botany|botanist]], named the species in that way in 1776 because he believed they originated in [[China]]. Most of the peppers of this species have a distinctive flavor and are similar in flavor to each other.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

| Once considered to be the hottest chili pepper, the habanero has been surpassed by other hot varieties, but it is nonetheless hotter than most commonly available cultivars. The habanero has a subtle, fruity flavour and a floral aroma.  It is closely related to many other very hot peppers. Disseminated to China over 500 years ago by Spanish and Portuguese explorers, it became so much a part of Chinese cuisine, botanists who found it in China thought it was native to the area and thus named this species ''Capsicum chinense'', based on the habaneros from China.

From 2000 to the present, at least 28&amp;nbsp;[[tropical cyclones|tropical]] or [[subtropical cyclone]]s affected the [[U.S. state]] of [[Louisiana]]. According to David Roth of the [[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]] (HPC), a tropical cyclone makes [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] along the coastline about two times every three years, and a hurricane makes landfall once every 2.8&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="LA Hurricanes"&gt;{{cite book|title=Louisiana Hurricane History|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/lahur.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[National Weather Service|United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service]]|accessdate=December 28, 2012|author=Roth, David M|author2=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most active month for tropical cyclone activity in the state is September, with ten total storms, while no recorded storms have affected Louisiana during the months of December through May. The most intense storm to affect the state in terms of [[barometric pressure]] is [[Hurricane Katrina]] of 2005, which also caused the most fatalities and damage with 1,833&amp;nbsp;total deaths and over $100&amp;nbsp;billion in total damages.{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in the value of the [[United States dollar|USD]] during the storm's year of existence.|group="nb"}} Katrina is also the [[List of costliest Atlantic hurricanes|second costliest]] hurricane in the Atlantic basin. In terms of [[wind speed]], Hurricane Katrina is also the 2nd strongest storm to affect the state,(Right behind Hurricane Rita which also hit in 2005), producing [[maximum sustained winds]] of {{convert|125|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, equivalent to [[Category 3 hurricane|Category&amp;nbsp;3]] on the [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale]].

The storm surge and waves resulted in significant beach erosion in Grand Isle. Portions of Louisiana experienced significant rainfall, including a peak of {{convert|18|in|mm}} in [[Haynesville, Louisiana|Haynesville]]. In addition, a tornado caused damage to the roof of a trailer in Golden Meadow. Rainfall and storm surge flooded 20 homes in Terrebonne Parish. In addition, several homes in Lafouche Parish experienced flooding, including two with over two feet of water. Numerous homes in Golden Meadow experienced flooding, as well. The flooding also forced the temporary closing of numerous roads across the state, including portions of [[U.S. Route 11|Route 11]] and [[Interstate 10]]. Flood waters from the storm cracked a water line in [[LaPlace, Louisiana|LaPlace]], leaving nearly 30,000 residents and many businesses without tap water. The problem was expected to take little time to fix, though residents were advised to boil the water before drinking it. Matthew also left 2,500 people without power for a short period of time. The storm's impact also closed several schools. In all, Matthew caused $255,000 in damage (2004 USD).

*July 10, 2005&amp;nbsp;– [[Hurricane Dennis]] produced light precipitation and a wind gust of {{convert|47|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at [[Lakefront Airport]] in New Orleans.
*August 29, 2005&amp;nbsp;– Storm surge from [[Hurricane Katrina]] resulted in multiple levee failures in the New Orleans area, flooding approximately 80% of the city, with some places being inundated by more than {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} of water. The failures of the levees were considered the worst engineering disaster in the history of the United States. Thousands of people were stranded inside their homes or on rooftops and required rescue from boats and helicopters. Many buildings and homes were damaged, with 134,000&amp;nbsp;housing units &amp;ndash; approximately 70% of residences in New Orleans &amp;ndash; were impacted to some degree. The [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]], which was sheltering many people who had not evacuated, sustained significant damage. Two sections of the Superdome's roof were compromised and the dome's waterproof membrane had essentially been peeled off. The famous [[French Quarter]] and [[Garden District, New Orleans|Garden District]] escaped flooding because those area are above sea level. A total of 573&amp;nbsp;deaths occurred in New Orleans alone.&lt;br&gt; Several other parishes were severely impacted by the storm. Many areas outside of New Orleans also suffered wind damage, especially St. Tammany and Washington parishes. According to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, in St. Bernard Parish, 81% (20,229) of the housing units were damaged. In St. Tammany Parish, 70% (48,792) were damaged, and in Placquemines Parish 80% (7,212) were damaged. Nearly 900,000&amp;nbsp;Louisianians were left without electricity.

*Mid–August 2010&amp;nbsp;– [[Tropical Depression Five (2010)|Tropical Depression Five]] - The remnants of Tropical Depression Five make two separate landfalls within the state. Upon its classification as a Tropical Depression, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issues a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] for much of southern Louisiana, including [[New Orleans]]. The storm ultimately dissipates prior to reaching the coastline, and the remnants of the cyclone produce riptides and strong waves along the coast. A local National Weather Service office issues [[Flood alert|flood watches]] for up to twelve Louisiana parishes. As the remnants of the cyclone regain strength in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and approach the state for a second time, a [[coastal flood watch]] is issued for southern portions of the state. Up to sixteen hours of intense rain and thunderstorms flood at least 40 buildings and structures in [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana]].
*September 4, 2011&amp;nbsp;– [[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Tropical Storm Lee]] - A state of emergency is declared for [[New Orleans]] ahead of Lee, with the threat of the storm prompting the preparation of rescue boats across the city and city officials ordering the closure of [[floodgate]]s. Due to its slow and erratic motion across the state, Lee drops torrential rainfall across much of southern Louisiana. [[Headwind and tailwind|Headwinds]] from the storm fan a large and destructive fire in [[Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana]], where about 400 acres of land is set ablaze and subsequently destroyed. In addition, several homes in [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]] are inundated by a four-foot storm surge. New Orleans also suffers sporadic power outages, but escapes with only minor flooding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7043">This is an incomplete list of [[plants]] with trifoliate leaves. '''Trifoliate''' leaves (also known as '''trifoliolate''' or '''ternate''' leaves) are a [[leaf shape]] characterized by a leaf divided into three leaflets. Species which are known to be trifoliate are listed here. Genera which are characteristically trifoliate are also listed, with species underneath. Genera which are generally ''not'' trifoliate are not listed; only the trifoliate species are. Entries are currently listed in alphabetical order, but in the future it may be desirable to list them by families. It may also be desirable to include common names and references.

The '''''Living Planet Report''''' is  published every two years by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] since 1998. It is based on the [[Living Planet Index]] and [[ecological footprint]] calculations.

The ''Living Planet Report'' is the world's leading, science-based analysis on the health of our planet and the impact of human activity.  Humanity's demands exceed the Earth's capacity to sustain us.&lt;ref name=report2016&gt;{{cite report|url=http://awsassets.panda.org/downloads/lpr_living_planet_report_2016.pdf |title=''Living Planet Report'' 2016: Risk and resilience in a new era |publisher=[[World Wildlife Fund]] |isbn=978-2-940529-40-7 |pages=1–74 |accessdate=29 October 2016}} ([http://awsassets.panda.org/downloads/lpr_living_planet_report_2016_summary.pdf Summary]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 report found a "decline of 60% in population sizes" of vertebrate species overall from 1970 to 2014. The tropics of South and Central America had an 89% loss compared to 1970. The 2018 report calls for new goals post-2020 alongside those of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Agreement]] and the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name=report2018&gt;{{cite report |title=''Living Planet Report'' 2018: Aiming higher |url=http://assets.wwf.ca/downloads/lpr2018_full_report_spreads.pdf |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |isbn=978-2-940529-90-2 |pages=1–75 |accessdate=31 October 2018}} ([http://assets.wwf.ca/downloads/lpr2018_summary_report_pages.pdf Summary]).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17951">In [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], '''Melia''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Μελία), a daughter of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Oceanus]], was the consort of [[Apollo]], and the mother, by Apollo, of the [[Thebes, Greece|Theban]] hero and prophet [[Tenerus (son of Apollo)|Tenerus]]. She was also the mother (or sister) of [[Ismenus]], god of the Theban river of the same name. Melia was an important cult figure at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. She was worshipped at the Ismenion, the Temple of Apollo at Thebes, and was associated with a nearby spring.

==Mythology==
The late 6th–early 5th century BC [[Thebes, Greece|Theban]] poet [[Pindar]] tells us that Melia, a daughter of Oceanus, was, by [[Apollo]], the mother of the Theban hero and prophet '''Tenerus'''.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, pp. 40&amp;ndash;41, 142; [[Pindar]], ''Paean 9'' fr. 52k 34–46 (Race 1997b, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pindar-fragments/1997/pb_LCL485.293.xml?rskey=uUnpv2&amp;result=1&amp;mainRsKey=al0jlH pp. 292&amp;ndash;295]; Rutherford, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gPjZOB1YNqAC&amp;pg=PA191 pp. 191&amp;ndash;192]); also [[Strabo]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.2.34 9.2.34], which says that the "Teneric Plain" was named after Tenerus the son of Melia and Apollo.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere he refers to her as "Melia of the golden spindle".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], fr. 29 1 (Race 1997b, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pindar-fragments/1997/pb_LCL485.233.xml?mainRsKey=KX3fcB&amp;result=2&amp;rskey=U8dE7v pp. 232, 233]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2nd century AD Greek geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] provides a more complete account.&lt;ref&gt; Larson, p. 142; Schachter 1967, p. 4; Fontenrose [https://books.google.com/books?id=wqeVv09Y6hIC&amp;pg=PA317, pp. 317&amp;ndash;318]; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.10.5 9.10.5], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.10.6 6], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.26.1 9.26.1].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pausanias, Melia was abducted, and Melia's father Oceanus ordered his son [[Caanthus]] to find her. Caanthus found Melia at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] being held by Apollo, but unable to get Melia away from Apollo, Caanthus set fire to Apollo's sanctuary, and Apollo shot and killed him. Pausanius says that, in addition to Tenerus, to whom Apollo gave the "art of divination", Melia had another son by Apollo, [[Ismenus]], after whom the Theban river Ismenus was named.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.10.6 9.10.6]; c.f. [[Pindar]], fr. 29 1 (Race 1997b, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pindar-fragments/1997/pb_LCL485.233.xml?mainRsKey=KX3fcB&amp;result=2&amp;rskey=U8dE7v pp. 232, 233]). For the Theban Ismenus river, see Berman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zoeSBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 p. 18].&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Melia and Caanthus, as recorded by Pausainus, is a close parallel to the more famous story of [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]] and [[Cadmus]], the founder and first king of Thebes. Like Melia, Europa is abducted by an Olympian god (in this case [[Zeus]]), and her brother Cadmus is sent by their father to bring Europa back home, but like Caanthus, Cadmus is unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 142, describes the story as "clearly a doublet of the better-known myth" of Cadmus and Europa"; Schachter 1967, p. 4, calls Melia's story an "imitation" of the story of Cadmus and Europa; see also Schachter 1981, p. 79; Fontenrose, p. 318. Compare with the story of the Theban [[Amphion]] (see below).&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by [[Joseph Fontenrose|Fontenrose]], there are other apparent congruences between the Theban Melia and Europa.&lt;ref&gt;Fontenrose, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Melia, Europa  was also the name of an Oceanid,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+349 357]; [[Andron|Andron of Halicarnassus]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=j0nRE4C2WBgC&amp;pg=PA42 fr. 7 Fowler] = ''[[FGrHist]]'' 10 F 7 (Fowler 2013, [https://books.google.com/books?id=scd8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 p. 13]).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Agenor]], the usual father of Europa, had, according to the fifth-century BC mythographer [[Pherecydes of Athens|Pherecydes]], a daughter named Melia who was a wife of [[Danaus]],&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 208; [[Pherecydes of Athens|Pherecydes]] fr. 21 Fowler 2001, p. 289 = ''[[FGrHist]]'' 3 F 21 = Scholia on [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius Rhodius]],&amp;nbsp;''[[Argonautica]]'' 3.1177-87f.&lt;/ref&gt; while, according to the mythographer Apollodrus, one of Danaos' wife's was also named Europa.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.1.5 2.1.5].&lt;/ref&gt;

There were apparently other versions of this Theban Melia's story.&lt;ref&gt;Schachter 1967, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In some traditions perhaps, the Thebans Melia and Ismenus were siblings, rather than mother and son. A scholiast on Pindar says that Ismenus was Melia's brother.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 304 n. 57; Fontenrose, p. 319; Scholia on [[Pindar]], ''Pythian'' 11.5–6 (Drachmann, [https://archive.org/details/scholiaveterainp02drac/page/254 pp. 254&amp;ndash;255]).&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]], the first fratricide occurred at Thebes when Melia's brothers, Ismenus and Claaitus (a corruption or variant of Caanthus?) fought over her.&lt;ref&gt;Schachter 1967, p. 4; Fontenrose, p. 319; ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]'' X 1241.4.5&amp;ndash;10 (Grenfell and Hunt, pp. [https://archive.org/details/oxyrhynchusppt1000grenuoft/page/104/mode/1up 104: Greek text], [https://archive.org/details/oxyrhynchusppt1000grenuoft/page/109/mode/1up 109: translation], [https://archive.org/details/oxyrhynchusppt1000grenuoft/page/110/mode/1up 110: commentary]).&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of Melia's story perhaps also involved the Theban [[Amphion]].&lt;ref&gt;Schachter 1967, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Pherecydes says that Melia was the name of one of the daughters of [[Amphion]] and his wife [[Niobe]],&lt;ref&gt;Fowler 2013, [https://books.google.com/books?id=scd8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA367 p. 367]; Schachter 1967, p. 4; [[Pherecydes of Athens|Pherecydes]] fr. 126 Fowler 2001, p. 342 = ''[[FGrHist]]'' 3 F 126 = Scholia on [[Euripides]], ''[[Phoenician Women]]'' 159.&lt;/ref&gt; while later sources tell us that Ismenus was the name of one of their sons.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter 1967, p. 4; [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.5.6 3.5.6]; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL042.303.xml 6.221&amp;ndash;224]; [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 11 (Smith and Trzaskoma, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vczTNMWLGdoC&amp;pg=PA100 p. 100]). &lt;/ref&gt; Like Caanthus, Amphion was shot and killed by Apollo because of an attack on his temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 9  (Smith and Trzaskoma, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vczTNMWLGdoC&amp;pg=PA99 p. 99]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd century BC poet [[Callimachus]] appears to make this Theban Melia, rather than a daughter of Oceanus, one of the "earth-born" [[Meliae]], the ash tree nymphs, who, according to [[Hesiod]], were born, along with the [[Erinyes]] and the [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Giants]], from Gaia (Earth) and the blood of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] (Sky), which dripped on Gaia when Uranus was castrated by his son [[Cronus]].&lt;ref&gt; Larson, p. 142; [[Callimachus]], ''Hymn 4—To Delos'' [https://archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/90/mode/2up 79–85 with note i]; [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+187 187].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the mythographer [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], the mother of [[Phoroneus]], and [[Aegialeus (King of Sicyon)|Aegialeus]], by her brother, the river god [[Inachus]], was also a daughter of [[Oceanus]] named [[Melia (consort of Inachus)|Melia]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, s.v. Melia 2, p. 281; [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.1.1 2.1.1].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cult===
Melia was an important object of cult worship at the Ismenion, the major sanctuary of Apollo Ismenios at Thebes.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 142; Berman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zoeSBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 64], [https://books.google.com/books?id=zoeSBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124 124]; Schachter 1967, p. 5, which calls her an "important component of the cult complex" at the Ismenion; for the Ismenion, and the cult of Melia, see Schachter 1981, pp. 77&amp;ndash;88 (Melia: p. 78); Schachter 1967, pp. 3&amp;ndash;5.&lt;/ref&gt; In at least three separate poems, Pindar mentions Melia in connection with the Theban sanctuary. In one he refers to the Ismenion and "the splendid hall of Oceanus’ daughter . . . Melia".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Paean 7'' fr. 52g (Race 1997b, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pindar-fragments/1997/pb_LCL485.279.xml?mainRsKey=KX3fcB&amp;result=3&amp;rskey=U8dE7v pp. 278, 279] ; Rutherford, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gPjZOB1YNqAC&amp;pg=PA339 p. 339]).&lt;/ref&gt; In another, Pindar summons the local heroines, the daughters of Cadmus, [[Semele]] and [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino Leucothea]], along with the mother of [[Heracles]], to "join Melia at the treasury of the golden tripods,"&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 142; Rutherford, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gPjZOB1YNqAC&amp;pg=PA341 p. 341]; [[Pindar]], ''Pythian'' 11.4&amp;ndash;6 (Race 1997a, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pindar-pythian_odes/1997/pb_LCL056.381.xml?result=5&amp;rskey=HX9pmG pp. 380, 381]); c.f. [[Herodotus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.52 1.52].&lt;/ref&gt; that is in the ''[[adyton]]'', the inner inviolate sanctuary of the Ismenion where the votive tripods were dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;Schachter 2016, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YfA4DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA267 p. 267], which further supposes that Melia would have had a cult image, perhaps made of ash wood; see also Schachter 1981, pp. 82&amp;ndash;83; Schachter 1967, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
Also at the Ismenion, Pindar locates the "immortal couch [''λέχει''] of Melia",&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Paean 9'' fr. 52k 35 (Race 1997b, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pindar-fragments/1997/pb_LCL485.293.xml?rskey=uUnpv2&amp;result=1&amp;mainRsKey=al0jlH pp. 292&amp;ndash;293]; Rutherford, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gPjZOB1YNqAC&amp;pg=PA191 p. 191]).&lt;/ref&gt; the child-bed, where Melia gave birth.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zoeSBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 64]; Rutherford, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gPjZOB1YNqAC&amp;pg=PA196 196], [https://books.google.com/books?id=gPjZOB1YNqAC&amp;pg=PA341 341].&lt;/ref&gt; A spring near the Ismenion was identified with Melia, perhaps the source of the Ismenus river, and perhaps the same spring as the one mentioned by Pausanias as the spring, above the Ismenion, by which her brother Caanthus was buried.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 142; Schachter 1967, p. 5 with note 30; Fontenrose, p. 318; Scholia on [[Pindar]] ''Pythian'' 11.6 (Drachmann, [https://archive.org/details/scholiaveterainp02drac/page/255 p. 255]), which says the spring had the same name as the "heroine" Melia, daughter of Oceanus; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.10.5 9.10.5].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thebans traced their descent from the union of Apollo and Melia, through the heroes Tenerus and Ismenus. According to Larson, while their descent from Apollo&amp;mdash;a panhellenic Olympian god&amp;mdash;increased their prestige, and connected them to other Greeks, their descent from Melia&amp;mdash;a nymph associated with the local landscape&amp;mdash;helped to establish their connection with the land that they inhabited.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, pp. 40&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Melite''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|l|ᵻ|t|iː}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Μελίτη) was one of the [[Naiads]], daughter of the river god [[Aegaeus]], and one of the many loves of [[Zeus]] and his son [[Heracles]]. Given the choice, she chose Heracles over Zeus who went off in search of other pursuits. She gave birth to Hercules's son [[Hyllus]]; some suggest that he was a figure distinct from Hyllus, the son of Heracles by [[Deianeira]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 4. 1149&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
Heracles tried to find refuge on the mythical island of [[Scheria]], widely considered to be the island of [[Corfu]] in modern Greece, after the murder of his children. He decided to rest near a lake. This lake happened to be the place in which Melite and her sisters were currently residing. When Melite saw Hercules she hid him away from her siblings in a deeper and darker part of the lake where she had sex with him. The two then traveled to another part of the island and stayed there until Melite gave birth to Hyllus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 4. 538 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeus was in a rage over her choice of a mortal over him, and so he appealed to her father who would not let her have anymore children with Hercules or any sexual contact whatsoever. Hercules promptly left Melite for other mortals. She was one of the women who were there mourning the death of Hercules.

Hyllus did not want to be a mere subject to King [[Nausithous]], so he traveled to the far north of Greece, where he became king and [[eponym]] of a non-Greek tribe, the Hylleis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 4. 524, 540, 1125, 1149; [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. ''Hylleis''; ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'' 776. 40 under ''Hylēōn''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mesobuthus eupeus''''' is a [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] [[scorpion]] [[species]] belonging to the well-known [[family (biology)|family]] [[Buthidae]]. Commonly known as the '''lesser Asian scorpion''' or the '''mottled scorpion'''. It is thought to be the most widely dispersed species of the ''[[Mesobuthus]]'' [[genus]], perhaps even of the family Buthidae.&lt;ref name=NCBI-Tax34648/&gt;&lt;ref name=UniProt-Tax34648/&gt;&lt;ref name="shi"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cheng-Min Shi |author2=Zu-Shi Huang |author3=Lei Wang |author4=Li-Jun He |author5=Yue-Ping Hua |author6=Liang Leng |author7=De-Xing Zhang |year=2007 |title=Geographical distribution of two species of ''Mesobuthus'' (Scorpiones, Buthidae) in China: insights from systematic field surveys and predictive models |journal=[[Journal of Arachnology]] |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=215–226 |jstor=25067833 |doi=10.1636/T06-20.1 |url=http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_free/JoA_v35_n2/arac-35-2-215.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''M. eupeus'' can reach a size of {{convert|4|to|5|cm}} in length. The entire body is yellow to yellowish brown. The dorsal segments ([[tergite]]s) of the [[mesosoma]] often have longitudinal irregular stripes that are black to dark brown.&lt;ref name="shi"/&gt; They exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]], the adult females being generally larger than males but have a lower number of [[Pecten (Arachnid)|pectinal teeth]] (16 to 23, as opposed to 22 to 28 in males).&lt;ref name="turkey"/&gt;

The [[pedipalp]]s of ''M. eupeus'' have a maximum of ten diagonal rows of granules on the fixed finger and eleven on the movable finger. The pedipalp [[Pincer (biology)|chela]]e (pincers) are wider than the patella (segment IV). The segments of the [[metasoma]] are thick and have eight keels (octocarinate). The [[telson]] is subglobose with a flat dorsal surface.&lt;ref name="turkey"/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
''M. eupeus'' were first described by the [[German people|German]] [[arachnologist]] [[Carl Ludwig Koch]] in 1839. It is classified under the genus ''Mesobuthus'' and belongs to the largest [[family (biology)|family]] of scorpions, the thick-tailed scorpion family [[Buthidae]].&lt;ref name="shi"/&gt; Currently, more than 23 [[subspecies]] of ''M. eupeus'' are recognized.&lt;ref name="teruel"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Teruel, Rolando|year=2002|title=First Record of ''Mesobuthus eupeus'' (Kock, 1939) from Western Turkey (Scorpiones: Buthidae)|journal=Revista Ibérica de Aracnología|volume=5|issue=31–VII|pages=75–76|issn=1576-9518|url=http://www.sea-entomologia.org/PDF/RIA_5/R05-013-075.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
''M. eupeus'' feed on small insects such as [[cricket (insect)|crickets]] or small [[cockroach]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f23mioGRlR0 |title=''Mesobuthus eupeus'' feeding |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=28 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cannibalism]] is very rare in this species. They do not dig burrows and prefer using natural spaces and burrows under stones and other objects. They have slender [[pedipalps]] so they usually rely on their stings for killing their prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dong Sun  |author2=Zhen-Ning Sun  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011 |title=Notes on the genus ''Mesobuthus'' (Scorpiones: Buthidae) in China, with description of a new species |journal=[[Journal of Arachnology]] |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=59–75 |doi=10.1636/Ha10-36.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venom==
The venom of ''M. eupeus'' is not as potent as that of other dangerous buthid species.&lt;ref name="Ahmadi2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Ahmadi |author2=A. Zare Mirakabadi |author3=M. Hashemlou |author4=M. Hejazi |year=2009 |title=Study on anti inflammatory effect of scorpion ''(Mesobuthus eupeus)'' venom in adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats |journal=Archives of Razi Institute |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=51–56 |url=http://sid.ir/en/VEWSSID/J_pdf/83520090107.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims of stings feel intense pain, hyperemia, swelling and a burning sensation in the affected area, while numbness and itching were also reported in some cases.&lt;ref name="Ozkan&amp;Kat, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ozkan|first=O.|author2=Kat, I.|date=Oct 30, 2005|title=''Mesobuthus eupeus'' scorpionism in Sanliurfa region of Turkey|journal=J.

As in other scorpions, the venom of ''M. eupeus'' contains various neurotoxic proteins that interact specifically with ion channels. A number of unique proteins in this scorpion's venom have been identified,&lt;ref name="UniProtKB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism%3a34648&amp;offset=0|title=Results for organism:"''Buthus eupeus'' (Lesser Asian scorpion) (''Mesobuthus eupeus'') &lt;nowiki&gt;[34648]&lt;/nowiki&gt;" in UniProtKB|work=[[UniProtKB]]|publisher=[[UniProt|UniProt Consortium]]|accessdate=Sep 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; cloned and investigated for clinical applications.  For instance, MeuKTX, structurally related to BmKTX (α-KTx3.6) from ''[[Mesobuthus martensii|M. martensii]]'', potently inhibits rKv1.1, rKv1.2 and hKv1.3 channels but does not affect rKv1.4, rKv1.5, hKv3.1, rKv4.3, and hERG channels even at high concentrations.&lt;ref name=pmid20713119&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 20713119 | year = 2010 | last1 = Gao | first1 = B | last2 = Peigneur | first2 = S | last3 = Tytgat | first3 = J | last4 = Zhu | first4 = S | title = A potent potassium channel blocker from Mesobuthus eupeus scorpion venom | volume = 92 | issue = 12 | pages = 1847–53 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2010.08.003 | journal = Biochimie | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

A number of [[antimicrobial peptide]]s have also been found in the venom of ''M. eupeus''. Meucin-13 and Meucin-18 exhibited extensive [[cytolytic]] effects on bacteria, fungi and yeasts.&lt;ref name=pmid19088182&gt;{{Cite journal| pmid = 19088182 | doi=10.1096/fj.08-122317| title=Structural and functional characterization of two genetically related meucin peptides highlights evolutionary divergence and convergence in antimicrobial peptides| journal=The FASEB Journal| volume=23| issue=4| pages=1230–45| year=2008| last1=Gao| first1=B.| last2=Sherman| first2=P.| last3=Luo| first3=L.| last4=Bowie| first4=J.| last5=Zhu| first5=S.| postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;inconsistent citations&amp;#125;&amp;#125;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Meucin-24 and Meucin-25, first identified from genetic sequences expressed in their venom gland, were shown to selectively kill ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' and inhibit the development of ''[[Plasmodium berghei]]'', both [[malaria]] parasites, but do not harm mammalian cells.  These two venom-derived proteins are therefore attractive candidates for the development of [[Antimalarial medication|anti-malarial drugs]].&lt;ref name=pmid20097251&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 20097251 | year = 2010 | last1 = Gao | first1 = B | last2 = Xu | first2 = J | last3 = Rodriguez Mdel | first3 = C | last4 = Lanz-Mendoza | first4 = H | last5 = Hernández-Rivas | first5 = R | last6 = Du | first6 = W | last7 = Zhu | first7 = S | title = Characterization of two linear cationic antimalarial peptides in the scorpion Mesobuthus eupeus | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 350–9 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2010.01.011 | journal = Biochimie }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian researchers have also reported that the venom of ''M. eupeus'' has [[anti-inflammatory]] properties and is effective as an anti-[[arthritis]] treatment in an experimental rat model, but the mechanism of action is unknown.&lt;ref name="Ahmadi2009"/&gt;

==Habitat and distribution==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">'''Papahānaumoku''', sometimes called '''Papa''', is the [[Mother goddess#Earth Mother|earth mother]] [[goddess]] in [[Hawaiian religion]] of the [[Kanaka Maoli]]. Together with her husband [[Wākea]] (''sky father'') Papa is the ancestor of all people and Kalo, and  mother of islands as the Kanaka Maoli manifestation of [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]].

The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument was renamed in 2007 to the [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]], a variant form of her name.

==Worship==
There are many legends surrounding Papa. She is worshipped by [[Native Hawaiians]], especially by women, as a primordial force of [[Creation myth|creation]] who has the power to give life and to heal. A women's temple, called [[Hale o Papa]], is the primary religious structure associated with her worship. Hale o Papa are often built in connection with [[Luakini]], or men's temples (places of "official" ceremony, which are primarily dedicated to the gods [[Kū]] and [[Lono]]), although it is believed by many practitioners that they may also exist independently. 

She was the daughter of Kuaniehu who married Kahakauakoko (f).  Papanuihanaumoku first married Wakea, then his brother Te Tumu, then Atea and last but not least, Rangi.  Papa's husbands were the sons of Kupulanakehau (f) who married Kahiko.  She was certainly not a God, her descendants from her and her husbands were the Ariki lines (High ranking Nobles, Kings) of Hawaii, Rarotonga, Aitutaki and the Maori.  These lines permeated into all the Isles of Polynesia.  Papa's  great/great/great/great/great grandmother was Oahu, daughter of Hawaii Loa and Hualalai.


Papanuihanaumoku, also known as Papa and Papatuanuku died in Waieri, Tahiti.

==Legend==
According to legend, Papa was born in [[Kalihi]] Valley, [[Oʻahu]] and spent her early childhood there. She travelled throughout the islands, and eventually wed Wākea. Together they had a daughter, Ho{{okina}}ohokukalani (literally, ''one who creates the stars of heaven''). As the girl grew, Wākea fell in love with his daughter and began to have an intimate relationship with her. He tricked Papa (in some versions of the story, the institution of the [[kapu]] system was part of his scheme) in order to keep her away, so that he could seduce Ho{{okina}}ohokukalani. When Papa discovered the truth, she was furious. However, when Ho{{okina}}ohokukalani gave birth to a stillborn baby, it was Papa who named the child Haloa and buried him in the soft earth; from that place sprung the first [[Kalo in Hawaii|kalo]]. Ho{{okina}}ohokukalani again mated with her father Wākea, and had a living child, who was also named Haloa.  This child became the ancestor to all Kanaka Maoli, or all humans (depending upon interpretation)..

==Aloha ʻAina==
In the [[Aloha ʻĀina]] movement, Papa is often a central figure, as her spirit is that of the life-giving, loving, forgiving earth who nurtures human life, and who is being abused by the misdeeds of mankind, especially in regard to the abuse of nature.

In 2008, Papahānaumoku and Wākea's names inspired the newly inaugurated [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]].

'''Power engineering''', also called '''power systems engineering''', is a subfield of electrical engineering that deals with the generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of [[electric power]], and the electrical apparatus  connected to such systems. Although much of the field is concerned with the problems of [[three-phase electric power|three-phase AC power]] – the standard for large-scale power transmission and distribution across the modern world – a significant fraction of the field is concerned with the conversion between [[rectifier|AC and DC power]] and the development of specialized power systems such as those used in aircraft or for electric railway networks. Power engineering draws the majority of its theoretical base from [[electrical engineering]].

{{main|Electrical engineering#History}}

==Pioneering years==
[[Electricity]] became a subject of scientific interest in the late 17th century.  Over the next two centuries a number of important discoveries were made including the [[incandescent light bulb]] and the [[voltaic pile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The History Of The Light Bulb | publisher = Net Guides Publishing, Inc. | year = 2004 | url = http://www.thehistoryof.net/the-history-of-the-light-bulb.html | accessdate = 2007-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Thomas | last = Greenslade | title = The Voltaic Pile | publisher = [[Kenyon College]] | url = http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Electricity/Voltaic_Pile/Voltaic_Pile.html | accessdate = 2008-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the greatest discovery with respect to power engineering came from [[Michael Faraday]] who in 1831 discovered that a change in magnetic flux induces an [[electromotive force]] in a loop of wire&amp;mdash;a principle known as [[electromagnetic induction]] that helps explain how generators and transformers work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Faraday Page | publisher = The Royal Institute | url = http://www.rigb.org/heritage/faradaypage.jsp | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080329153140/http://www.rigb.org/heritage/faradaypage.jsp | archivedate = 2008-03-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881 two electricians built the world's first power station at [[Godalming]] in England. The station employed two waterwheels to produce an alternating current that was used to supply seven Siemens [[arc lamp]]s at 250 volts and thirty-four [[incandescent lamp]]s at 40 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=744 | title=Godalming Power Station | publisher=Engineering Timelines | accessdate=2009-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However supply was intermittent and in 1882 [[Thomas Edison]] and his company, The Edison Electric Light Company, developed the first steam-powered electric power station on Pearl Street in New York City. The [[Pearl Street Station]] consisted of several generators and initially powered around 3,000 lamps for 59 customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jasmin | last=Williams | title = Edison Lights The City | publisher =[[New York Post]] | url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/11302007/news/cextra/edison_lights_the_city_514905.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | date=2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Casey | last = Grant | title = The Birth of NFPA | publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]] | url = http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=500&amp;itemID=18020&amp;URL=About%20Us/History&amp;cookie%5Ftest=1 | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071228104759/http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=500&amp;itemID=18020&amp;URL=About%20Us%2FHistory&amp;cookie_test=1 | archivedate = 2007-12-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The power station used [[direct current]] and operated at a single voltage. Since the direct current power could not be easily transformed to the higher voltages necessary to minimise power loss during transmission, the possible distance between the generators and load was limited to around half-a-mile (800 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Bulk Electricity Grid Beginnings  | publisher=New York Independent System Operator |url=http://www.pearlstreetinc.com/NYISO_bulk_elect_beginnings.pdf | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year in London [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]] demonstrated the first transformer suitable for use in a real power system. The practical value of Gaulard and Gibbs' transformer was demonstrated in 1884 at [[Turin]] where the transformer was used to light up forty kilometres (25 miles) of railway from a single [[alternating current]] generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/gaulard.html | title=Lucien Gaulard | first=Evgeny | last=Katz | date=2007-04-08 | accessdate=2008-05-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072336/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/gaulard.html |archivedate = 2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the success of the system, the pair made some fundamental mistakes. Perhaps the most serious was connecting the primaries of the transformers in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] so that switching one lamp on or off would affect other lamps further down the line. Following the demonstration [[George Westinghouse]], an American entrepreneur, imported a number of the transformers along with a [[Siemens]] generator and set his engineers to experimenting with them in the hopes of improving them for use in a commercial power system.

One of Westinghouse's engineers, [[William Stanley, Jr.|William Stanley]], recognised the problem with connecting transformers in series as opposed to [[series and parallel circuits|parallel]] and also realised that making the iron core of a transformer a fully enclosed loop would improve the [[voltage regulation]] of the secondary winding. Using this knowledge he built the world's first practical transformer based alternating current power system at [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edisontechcenter.org/GreatBarrington.html Great Barrington 1886 - Inspiring an industry toward AC power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/stanley.html | title=Alternating Current Electrification, 1886 | publisher=IEEE | first=Thomas | last=Blalock | date=2004-10-02 | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference | number = 349611 | y = 1886 | m = 09 | d = 21 | inventor = William Stanley Jr. | title = Induction Coil}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; In 1885 the  Italian physicist and electrical engineer [[Galileo Ferraris]] demonstrated an [[induction motor]] and in 1887 and 1888 the Serbian-American engineer [[Nikola Tesla]] filed a range of patents related to power systems including one for a practical two-phase induction motor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8j5bJ5OkGpgC&amp;pg=PA36 |title=Fritz E. Froehlich, Allen Kent, The Froehlich/Kent Encyclopedia of Telecommunications: Volume 17, page 36 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petar Miljanic, Tesla's Polyphase System and Induction Motor, Serbian Journal of Electrical Engineering, pp.&amp;nbsp;121–130, Vol. 3, No. 2, November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which Westinghouse licensed for his AC system.

By 1890 the power industry had flourished and power companies had built thousands of power systems (both direct and alternating current) in the United States and Europe – these networks were effectively dedicated to providing electric lighting. During this time a fierce rivalry in the US known as the "[[War of Currents]]" emerged between Edison and Westinghouse over which form of transmission (direct or alternating current) was superior. In 1891, Westinghouse installed the first major power system that was designed to drive an electric motor and not just provide electric lighting. The installation powered a {{convert|100|hp}} synchronous motor at [[Telluride, Colorado]] with the motor being started by a Tesla induction motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/projects/cases/niagara.htm | title=The Day They Turned The Falls On | first=Jack | last=Foran | accessdate=2008-05-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151552/http://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/projects/cases/niagara.htm | archivedate=2008-05-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the Atlantic, [[Oskar von Miller]] built a 20 kV 176&amp;nbsp;km three-phase transmission line from [[Lauffen am Neckar]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] for the Electrical Engineering Exhibition in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.more-powerful-solutions.com/media/ScreenPDF_Hypower_15_72dpi.pdf | author=Voith Siemens (company) | title=HyPower | pages=7 | date=2007-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, after a protracted decision-making process, the [[Adams Power Plant|Adams No. 1 generating station]] at [[Niagara Falls]] began transmitting three-phase alternating current power to Buffalo at 11 kV. Following completion of the Niagara Falls project, new power systems increasingly chose [[alternating current]] as opposed to [[direct current]] for electrical transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/adams.html | title=Adams Hydroelectric Generating Plant, 1895 | publisher=IEEE | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Twentieth century==
===Power engineering and Bolshevism===
[[File:Klutsis (1929) Soviet Power plus electrification.png|thumb|right|1929 poster by [[Gustav Klutsis]]]]
The generation of electricity was regarded as particularly important following the [[October revolution|Bolshevik seizure of power]]. [[Lenin]] stated "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vladimir|first=Lenin|title=Our Foreign and Domestic Position and Party Tasks|year=1920|location=Moscow|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/nov/21.htm|quote=Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country, since industry cannot be developed without electrification.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently featured on many Soviet posters, stamps etc. presenting this view. The [[GOELRO plan]] was initiated in 1920 as the first Bolshevik experiment in industrial planning and in which Lenin became personally involved. [[Gleb Krzhizhanovsky]] was another key figure involved, having been involved in the construction of a power station in [[Moscow]] in 1910. He had also known Lenin since 1897 when they were both in the St. Petersburg chapter of the ''Union of Struggle for the Liberation of the Working Class''.

===Power engineering in the USA===
In 1936 the first commercial [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) line using [[mercury-arc valve]]s was built between [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] and [[Mechanicville, New York]]. HVDC had previously been achieved by installing direct current generators in series (a system known as the [[Thury system]]) although this suffered from serious reliability issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pes/public/2005/may/peshistory.html | title=A Novel but Short-Lived Power Distribution System | date=2005-05-01 | publisher=IEEE | accessdate=2008-05-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524013821/http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pes/public/2005/may/peshistory.html | archivedate=2011-05-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 [[Siemens]] demonstrated the first solid-state rectifier (solid-state rectifiers are now the standard for HVDC systems) however it was not until the early 1970s that this technology was used in commercial power systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Gene Wolf | title=Electricity Through the Ages | url=http://tdworld.com/mag/power_electricity_ages/ | work=Transmission &amp; Distribution World | date=2000-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 Westinghouse demonstrated the first [[circuit breaker]] that used [[sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] as the interrupting medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=John Tyner, Rick Bush and Mike Eby | title=A Fifty-Year Retrospective | url=http://tdworld.com/mag/power_fiftyyear_retrospective/ | work=Transmission &amp; Distribution World | date=1999-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is a far superior [[dielectric]] to air and, in recent times, its use has been extended to produce far more compact switching equipment (known as [[switchgear]]) and [[transformer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.abb.com/product/us/9AAC710047.aspx | publisher=ABB | title=Gas Insulated Switchgear | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.sayedsaad.com/Transformer/SF6_Transformer/sf6_transformer_main.htm | title=SF6 Transformer | first=Sayed | last=Amin | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many important developments also came from extending innovations in the [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] field to the power engineering field. For example, the development of computers meant [[load flow study|load flow studies]] could be run more efficiently allowing for much better planning of power systems. Advances in information technology and telecommunication also allowed for much better remote control of the power system's switchgear and generators.

==Power==
[[File:Qatar, power lines (6).jpg|thumb|220px|Transmission lines transmit power across the [[Power grid|grid]].]]

Power Engineering deals with the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]], [[electricity distribution|distribution]] and utilization of [[electricity]] as well as the design of a range of related devices. These include [[transformer]]s, [[electric generator]]s, [[electric motor]]s and [[power electronics]].

Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid. These systems are called off-grid power systems and may be used in preference to on-grid systems for a variety of reasons. For example, in remote locations it may be cheaper for a mine to generate its own power rather than pay for connection to the grid and in most mobile applications connection to the grid is simply not practical.

==Fields==

[[Electricity generation]] covers the selection, design and construction of facilities that convert energy from primary forms to electric power.

[[Electric power transmission]] requires the engineering of high voltage transmission lines and substation facilities to interface to generation and distribution systems. [[High voltage direct current]] systems are one of the elements of an electric power grid.

[[Electric power distribution]] engineering covers those elements of a power system from a substation to the end customer.

[[Power system protection]] is the study of the ways an electrical power system can fail, and the methods to detect and mitigate for such failures.

In most projects, a power engineer must coordinate with many other disciplines such as civil and mechanical engineers, environmental experts, and legal and financial personnel. Major power system projects such as a large generating station may require scores of design professionals in addition to the power system engineers. At most levels of professional power system engineering practice, the engineer will require as much in the way of administrative and organizational skills as electrical engineering knowledge.

==Professional societies==
In both the UK and the USA, professional societies had long existed for civil and mechanical engineers.  The [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]] was founded in the UK in 1871, and the [[AIEE]] in the United States in 1884. These societies contributed to the exchange of electrical knowledge and the development of electrical engineering education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8588">There are ten '''[[river basin]]s in [[Madhya Pradesh]]''' as ten major rivers originate from the State. As [[Madhya Pradesh]] is located in the center of India, most of the rivers are interstate rivers. The rivers namely, [[Chambal River|Chambal]], [[Sindh River|Sindh]], [[Betwa River|Betwa]], [[Ken River|Ken]] flow northward and meet with [[Yamuna]] whereas the river [[Son River|Sone]] falls directly into [[Ganges]]. [[Narmada River|Narmada]], [[Tapti River|Tapi]] and [[Mahi River|Mahi]] rivers flow westward and meet [[Arabian Sea]] whereas [[Wainganga River|Wainganga]] and [[Pench River|Pench]] rivers meet [[Godavari River|Godavari]] in the south. Annual run off from these rivers within the state is estimated 81719 hm, out of which about 49743 hm can be harnessed for irrigation purpose. The State can be divided onto six major river basins, the details of which are as follows. :

In the upper corners are [[Helios]] with the raven, and [[Selene|Luna]].]]

'''''Tauroctony''''' is a [[neologism|modern name]]{{sfn|Beck|2006|p=17}} given to the central [[Cult image|cult relief]]s of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Mithraic Mysteries]]. The imagery depicts [[Mithras]] killing a bull,&lt;!-- no details (precision would be inappropriate) --&gt; hence the name ''tauroctony'' after the Greek word ''tauroktonos'' (''ταυροκτόνος'', "bull killing"). It is distinct from the cultic slaughter of a bull in ancient Rome and known as a [[Taurobolium]], which was mainly associated with the cult of [[Cybele]].

Despite the name, the scene is symbolic, and there is no evidence that patrons of the Roman cult ever performed such a rite. Like all Greco-Roman mysteries, the Mithraic Mysteries was limited to initiates, and there is very little known about the cult's beliefs or practices. However, several images of the bull include a ''dorsuale'' ribbon or blanket, which was a Roman convention to identify a sacrificial animal, so it is fairly certain that the killing of the bull represents a sacrificial act. And, because the main bull-killing scene is often accompanied by explicit depictions of the sun, moon, and stars, it is also fairly certain that the scene has astrological connotations. But despite dozens of theories on the subject, none has received widespread acceptance. While the basic bull-killing image appears to have been adopted from a similar depiction of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], and it is certain that the bull-killing symbolism and the ancillary elements together tell a story (i.e. the cult myth, the cult's ''mystery'', told only to initiates), that story has been lost and is now unknown. Following several decades of increasingly convoluted theories, Mithraic scholarship is now generally disinclined to speculation.

The tauroctony should not be confused with a "[[taurobolium]]", which was an actual bull-killing cult act performed by initiates of the Mysteries of [[Magna Mater]], and has nothing to do with the Mithraic Mysteries. "There is no evidence that [initiates of the Mithraic mysteries] ever performed such a rite [i.e. a real bull killing], and ''a priori'' considerations suggest that a mithraeum &amp;ndash; any mithraeum &amp;ndash; would be a most impractical place to attempt it."{{sfn|Beck|1984|p=2026}}

===Introduction===&lt;!-- NO INTERPRETATIONS; DESCRIPTION ONLY. Interpretation follows separately, in another _top-level_ section --&gt; 
[[File:Santa Maria Capua Vetere Mithraeum Tauroctony.jpg|thumb|''CIMRM'' 181: Tauroctony fresco in the mithraeum of [[Santa Maria Capua Vetere]], [[2nd century]].]]
Whether as a painting or as carved monument, a depiction of the tauroctony scene belonged to the standard furniture of every [[mithraeum]]. At least one depiction would be mounted on the wall at the far end of the space where ritual activity took place, often in a niche dressed to be especially cavelike. Richly furnished mithraea, such as one in [[Stockstadt am Main]], had multiple cult reliefs.{{sfn|Clauss|2000|p=48}}

The scenes can be roughly divided into two groups. The "simple" depictions, which include just the main bull-killing scene, and the compound depictions, in which the tauroctony is the central and largest element, but which is framed by panels that portray other scenes.

===Mithras with the bull===
[[File:Tauroctony Heddernheim.jpg|thumb|''CIMRM'' 1083: Tauroctony relief from the "Heidenfeld" Mithraeum (Mithraeum I, Heddernheim, Germany), now in Wiesbaden. An extensive description is available at [[:Commons:File:Tauroctony Heddernheim.jpg|this image's Wikipedia commons page]].]]
&lt;!-- NO INTERPRETATIONS; DESCRIPTION ONLY. --&gt;Although there are numerous minor variations, the basic features of the central tauroctony scene is highly uniform: Mithras half-straddles a bull that has been forced to the ground. The bull invariably appears in profile, facing to his right (the viewers’ left). In original (un-reconstructed) depictions, Mithras invariably has his head turned away from the bull, and in many he is looking back over his right shoulder up to Sol (statuary that shows Mithras looking at the bull are the result of [[Renaissance|Renaissance-era]] restorations of monuments that were missing a head). The bull is held down by Mithras' left leg, which is bent at an angle and the knee of which presses down on the bull's spine. The bull's rump and right hind leg is restrained by Mithras' right leg, which is almost fully extended.

With his left hand, Mithras pulls back the head of the bull by the nostrils or the muzzle (never by the horns,{{sfn|Beck|1984|p=2073}}&lt;!-- this is possibly important because Statius' Thebaid refers to the head of the bull being pulled up by the horns; this could be just artistic license of course, but possibly also an indication of a prototype. See also Beck 1998: p.&amp;nbsp;119, n.&amp;nbsp;29 --&gt; which – if at all represented – are short). In his right hand, Mithras usually holds a knife or short sword&lt;!-- V. 76--&gt; plunged into the neck/shoulder of the bull. Alternatively  (''CIMRM'' 2196), the knife is sticking into the bull's neck, and Mithras has his arm raised as if in triumph. Mithras is usually dressed in a knee-length long-sleeved tunic (''tunica manicata''), closed boots and breeches (''anaxyrides'', ''bracae''). Mithras' cape, if he wears one, is usually spread open, as if flying. Occasionally, Mithras is nude (''CIMRM'' 2196&lt;!--/unknown provenance/lower Danube now in the Louvre--&gt;, 2327&lt;!--/Gaganica, Thrace--&gt;; 201&lt;!--/Italy--&gt;; 1275&lt;!--/Lopodunum Germania Sup--&gt;).{{sfn|Clauss|2000|p=95&lt;!--text of fig. 60--&gt;}} On his head, Mithras usually&lt;!-- notable exceptions include the Cluj relief (''CIMRM'' 2025, Clauss:83)--&gt; wears a [[phrygian cap]], like the one worn by [[Attis]].&lt;!--{{#tag:ref|and in other contexts emblematic of rule and autonomy.{{sfn|Gordon|1972|p=101, 117 note&amp;nbsp;47}} --&gt;  The tail of the bull occasionally appears to end in an ear of wheat. The blood from the wound is also sometimes depicted as ears of wheat, or as a cluster of grapes.{{sfn|Clauss|2000|p=80}}

Several cult images have the bull adorned with the Roman ''dorsuale'', sometimes decorated with embroidery. This dorsal band or blanket placed on the back of the animal is an adoption from the then-contemporary images of public sacrifice,&lt;!--clauss:81--&gt; and identifies the bull as a sacrificial beast.{{sfn|Clauss|2000|p=81}}

From traces of pigment found on some reliefs it seems that there was no particular coloring tradition that was followed. In the relief from Jajce (''CIMRM'' 1902), the bull is black, while Mithras' tunic is blue and his cloak red. In the relief from Marino and the wall fresco from Capua Vetere (''CIMRM'' 181), the bull is white. At Marino, Mithras' the tunic is red and the cloak blue. In a stucco group now in Frankfurt but originally from Rome (''CIMRM'' 430), the animal is reddish brown. In the relief from the Barbarini mithraeum (''CIMRM'' 390), the bull is light brown and Mithras' tunic and trousers are green.

===Artistic model===&lt;!-- this covers the art, not the interpretation --&gt;
"The model for the Mithraic bull-killing scene was probably the type of [[Nike (mythology)|winged Nike (Victory)]] killing the bull, which became a fashionable image once again in the reign of Trajan."{{sfn|Clauss|2000|p=79}} The similarity is so great that Cumont mistook ''CIMRM'' 25 from [[Sagalassos|near Baris&lt;!-- now Isparta, Turkey --&gt;]] to be related to the Mysteries. This was subsequently corrected by Vermaseren and others&lt;ref&gt;''cf.''&lt;!-- enumeration in --&gt; {{harvnb|Beck|1984|p=2019}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as being of Nike. Already in 1899, Cumont had identified the tauroctony as "the imitation of the motif of the classical Greek group of Nike sacrificing a bull",{{sfn|Cumont|1903|p=21}} but supposed that both tauroctony scenes were attributable to 2nd century BCE [[Pergamon|Pergamene]] artistic traditions.{{sfn|Cumont|1896&lt;!--II--&gt;|pp=180f}}{{sfn|Cumont|1903|p=24, 210}} This notion has been characterized as one of Cumont's "least happy hypotheses".{{sfn|Beck|1984|p=2072}}

===Ancillary elements===
[[Image:BritMusMithrasDog.JPG|thumb|Detail of [[#CIMRM593|''CIMRM'' 593]]: dog and serpent set at the bull's wound.]]
[[Image:BritMusMithrasScorpion.jpg|thumb|Detail of [[#CIMRM593|''CIMRM'' 593]]: scorpion heading for the [[bull's testicles]].]]
Usually a canine (commonly identified as a dog), a serpent and a scorpion also appear in most tauroctony scenes; the dog and serpent are typically set as reaching for the wound, while a scorpion is typically set at the genitals of the dying bull. Many reliefs also include a bird, commonly identified as a raven, somewhere in the scene. Not infrequently, &lt;!-- Beck 2006:31: "not infrequently" --&gt; particularly in reliefs from the Rhine and Danube frontiers, the tauroctony scenes include a [[wikt:chalice|chalice]] and a lion.

Seldom absent&lt;!-- Clauss 2000:95: "seldom absent"--&gt; from the reliefs, and also sometimes included in free-standing tauroctony statuary, are representations of Cautes and Cautopates, the torchbearering twins that appear as miniature versions of Mithras, respectively holding a raised torch and a lowered torch. Usually, Cautes stands to the right of the scene while Cautopates on the left. In fifty tauroctony scenes, their positions are reversed,{{sfn|Clauss|2000|p=96}} and in rare cases (such as the very earliest ''CIMRM'' 593), they are both on one side of the scene. The torchbearers commonly appear with crossed legs. On a number of reliefs, greenery or a tree is placed in the vicinity, sometimes on both sides of the bull, and at other times, such as at Nida (Germany) as a wreath around the relief. As Siscia in Pannonia Superior (Sisak, Croatia) a similar wreath is made of ears of wheat (''CIMRM'' 1475).

The signs of the twelve zodiacal constellations&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]], [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]], [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]], [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]], [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], [[Capricorn (constellation)|Capricorn]], [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]], [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]]&lt;/ref&gt; and allusions to seven [[classical planets]]&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In Greco-Roman times the Sun and Moon were categorized as "planets".&lt;/ref&gt; are common in the tauroctony reliefs and frescoes. The tauroctony reliefs (but not the statuary) almost always include busts of [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] and [[Luna (mythology)|Luna]], i.e. respectively the god of the Sun and the goddess of the Moon, which appear in respectively the left and right top corners of the scene. The more ambitious cult images include the Sun's horse-driven quadriga mounting upwards on the left, while Luna's oxen-driven ''[[biga (chariot)|biga]]'' descends on the right.{{sfn|Clauss|2000|p=84}} In these, Sol's chariot is preceded by the naked youth Phosphorus,&lt;!-- do not link; article is whacked --&gt; who runs ahead with a raised torch. Luna's chariot is preceded by Hesperus,&lt;!-- do not link; article is whacked --&gt; with lowered torch. The two youths are reminiscent of Cautes and Cautopates.{{sfn|Clauss|2000|p=84}}

Sol, Luna, and the other five planetary gods&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]&lt;/ref&gt; are also sometimes represented as stars in Mithras' outspread cloak, or scattered in the background. The seven planetary gods are also fairly commonly&lt;!--Clauss: 2000:86: "fairly common"--&gt; represented by the depiction of seven altars&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;e.g. ''CIMRM'' 40, 1275, 1818, 2245&lt;/ref&gt; or less commonly in anthropomorphic form, as busts or full-length. Several of the more detailed reliefs even seem to have the planetary gods placed in order of their week-day dedications,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;from right to left, Monday / day&amp;nbsp;2: Luna, Tuesday: Mars, Wednesday: Mercury, Thursday:Jupiter, Friday: Venus, Saturday / day&amp;nbsp;7: Saturn, Sunday / day&amp;nbsp;1: Sol&lt;/ref&gt; but no standard sequence is discernible.{{sfn|Clauss|2000|p=85}}

As first identified by Karl Bernhard Stark in 1879 but unexplored until the dismantling of the Cumontian transfer scenario in the 1970s, all the other elements of the tauroctony scene except Mithras&lt;!-- not obviously so; discussed below --&gt; himself have obvious astral correlations too. The constellations of Taurus (bull) and Scorpius (scorpion){{#tag:ref|On the role of the scorpion in the tauroctony, and its association with ideas widely current in Greco-Roman thought, see {{harvnb|Beck|1976c&lt;!--"A note on the scorpion in the tauroctony"--&gt;|pp=208–209}} |group=lower-alpha}} are on opposite points of the zodiac, and between them lies a narrow band of the sky in which the constellations of the canine (Canis Major/Minor or Lupus), snake (Hydra, but not Serpens or Draco&lt;!-- which are outside the narrow band--&gt;), the twins (Gemini), raven (Corvus), cup (Crater), lion (Leo), and the star of the 'wheat ear' (Spica, Alpha Virginis) appeared in the summers of the late first century.{{sfn|Beck|2006|pp=30-31}} Simultaneously, as Porphyry's description of the mysteries states, "the Moon is also known as a bull and Taurus is its 'exaltation'"&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''De antro'' 18, quoted in {{harvnb|Clauss|2000|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with Cumont, who held the astral symbolism (and all the other Greco-Roman elements in the mysteries) to be merely a late, superficial and adventitious accretion,{{sfn|Cumont|1903|pp=23-32}} "most Mithraic scholars"{{sfn|Beck|2006|p=31}} have treated the correspondences between elements of the tauroctony and the constellations as coincidental or trivial. But the chance that these correlations are an accidental unintended coincidence is "improbable in the extreme".{{sfn|Beck|2006|p=31}} The chance that the correlations were intentional, but added incoherently and unsystematically, is also "statistically negligible".{{sfn|Beck|2004b&lt;!-- Rise and Fall of ... --&gt;|p=240}} At the same time, the elements of the tauroctony scene all belong to the story that the designer of the scene wished to tell, and the bull is present primarily because Mithras kills one, not primarily because the bull is Taurus and/or the moon.{{sfn|Beck|2004c&lt;!-- "Astral symbolism in the tauroctony: A statistical demonstration ..."--&gt;|p=252}}

Occasionally, the busts of two or four wind gods are found in the corners of the cult reliefs.{{sfn|Clauss|2000|p=85}} The figures of other protective gods &lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;e.g. Juno-Hera, Oceanus, Hercules, Vulcan, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; also sometimes appear.{{sfn|Clauss|2000|p=85}}

==Interpretation==
Other than that the killing of the bull is a sacrificial act – as identifiable from reliefs where the bull is adorned with a ''dorsuale'' – the function and purpose of the tauroctony is uncertain. Since the tauroctony scenes are complemented by the cult meal scenes (sometimes even represented on two sides of the same monument), it may be that the killing is a salvific act; i.e. "[s]laughter and feast together effect the salvation of the faithful."{{sfn|Clauss|2000|p=112}}

===Traditional Cumontian view===
[[File:Mithra Musées de la Cour d'Or 100109.jpg|thumb|''CIMRM'' 966(v.I&lt;!--, I.323-325--&gt;): Tauroctony bas-relief from the Sarrebourg mithraeum (Pons Saravi, Gallia Belgica). Now at the Cour d'Or Museum, Metz, France.]]

Within the framework of the [[Franz Cumont|Cumontian]] supposition that the Mithraic mysteries was the "Roman form of Mazdaism", the (now obsolete) traditional view held that the tauroctony represented Zoroastrianism's cosmological myth of the killing of [[Gavaevodata|a primordial bovine]]. The myth is recounted in the [[Bundahishn]], a 9th-century AD Zoroastrian text.

In the myth, the evil spirit [[Ahriman]] (not Mithras) slays the primordial creature [[Gavaevodata]] which is represented as a bovine. Into this tale, Cumont interpolated&lt;!-- Mithra has no role whatsoever in either of the two Zoroastrian myths related to bovine killings; in the cosmological one it is Gavaevodata at the hand of Angra Mainyu, while in the eschatological one it is Srisok/Hadhayans at the hand of the Saoshyant.--&gt; the unwilling hand of Avestan Mithra on command of the Sun,{{sfn|Cumont|1903|p=135f}} speculating that there must have once existed a tale in which Mithra takes the role that the texts assign to Ahriman. This Cumontian characterization of Iranian Mithra has long been discarded as "not merely unsupported by Iranian texts" but is "actually in serious conflict with known Iranian theology", given Mithra's role in Iranian scripture as a "guardian of livestock", and whose stock epithet is "protector of pastures".{{sfn|Hinnells|1975|p=292}} Simply put: unlike Roman Mithras, Iranian Mithra does not do any bull-killing.

Recently, the iconographic reliefs of a bird and a bull, which are found in Iran, have been compared to the tauractony by Iranian scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibna.ir/vdcf0md1.w6djcagiiw.html بررسی مهر و میترا در منابع کهن ایرانی و «مسالک و ممالک»، خبرگزاری کتاب ایران، ۱ بهمن ۱۳۸۹]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern astrological interpretations===
[[File:Mytras Ceremony SIBIU Hystory Museum.JPG|thumb|right|''CIMRM 1935'': Tauroctonous Mithras from the Maros Porto mithraeum (Mureş port, Romania). Now at [[Brukenthal National Museum]].]]

In the wake of the 1970s dismantling of the Cumontian transfer scenario, Cumont's trivialization of the astronomical/astrological aspects of the Mysteries as "intellectual diversions designed to amuse the [[wikt:neophyte|neophytes]]"{{sfn|Cumont|1903|p=130}} has yielded to the general recognition that the astronomical/astrological aspects were part of the fundamental premises of the cult. This recognition is not new; "[s]ince the time of [[Celsus]] (around 178), author of ''Alēthēs Logos'', it has been known {{bracket|via [[Contra Celsum|Origen's ''Contra Celsum'']]}} that the Mithraic mysteries relate to fixed stars and planets."{{sfn|Chapman-Rietschi|1997|p=133}} In the post-Cumontian period, this recognition was first revived by Stanley Insler (second congress, 1975), who pointed out that the tauroctony could be interpreted solely in terms of the Greco-Roman understanding of astronomical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' {{harvnb|Bianchi|1976|p=89&lt;!-- Insler's paper was not included in the proceedings. This characterization is from Bianchi's report of the congress in JMS I, 1976: 77-94; Cf also de Jong's review in IIJ 22, 1980: 80-84, at 82; and Insler, 1978: 519-538--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Richard L. Gordon (1976) cautioned against overlooking the importance of the cult's astronomical symbolism.{{sfn|Gordon|1976|p=119}} Four contemporaneous articles (1976–1977) by Roger Beck stressed the role of astronomy/astrology in the context of Greco-Roman religious thought.{{sfn|Beck|1976a|p = 1f}}{{sfn|Beck|1976b|p = 95f}}{{sfn|Beck|1976c|p = 208}}{{sfn|Beck|1977|pp = 15-16}} Beck thought it ironic&lt;!-- Beck's word--&gt; that Cumont, "who was himself one of the most eminent scholars of ancient astrology,{{#tag:ref|Cumont was the author of the popular ''Astrology and Religion among the Greeks and Romans'' (1912), the more specialist ''L'Égypte des astrologues'' (1937), and also co-founder and co-editor of the multi-volume ''Catalogus Codicum Astrologorum Graecorum'' (1898–1953).|group=lower-alpha}} should have been unaware of this implication. [Cumont's] preoccupation with "les traditiones iraniennes" had blinkered him."{{sfn|Beck|1977|p=16 note&amp;nbsp;27}}

Accordingly, since the 1970s, the zodiacal symbolism in the scene has provoked much speculation that the cult relief represents some sort of "star-map" code that poses a riddle of Mithras' identity. Beck (2006) summarizes them as follows:
* Alessandro Bausani (1979): Tauroctonous Mithras as Leo;
* Michael Speidel (1980): ... as Orion; 
* Karl-Gustav Sandelin (1988): ... as Auriga; 
* David Ulansey (1989): ... as Perseus; 
* John David North (1990): ... as Betelgeuse; 
* Roger Beck (1994): ... as the Sun in Leo. 
* Maria Weiss (1994, 1998): ... as the night sky.
Additionally, Stanley Insler (1978) and Bruno Jacobs (1999) identify the entire bull-killing scene with the heliacal setting of Taurus. &lt;!-- All _9_ are all from a summary by Beck --&gt; In 2006, Roger Beck found all these approaches "lacked persuasiveness" because they were "ungrounded in proper contextual soil."{{sfn|Beck|2006|p=34}} There is no consensus on the issue.

==Legacy==
The image was adapted for a [[Prix de Rome]] sculpture of ''The Madness of Orestes'' by Raymond Barthélemy (1860); the prize-winning plaster model remains in the collection of the [[École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts]], where it was included in the 2004 travelling exhibition ''Dieux et Mortels''.

'''Triphosphorus pentanitride''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] [[Phosphorus|P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]][[Nitride|N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Containing only phosphorus and nitrogen, this material is classified as a [[binary compound|binary]] nitride.  No applications have been developed for this material, which remains a topic of research.  It is a white solid, although samples often appear colored owing to impurities.

== Synthesis ==
Triphosphorus pentanitride can be produced by reactions between various [[phosphorus]](V) and nitrogen compounds (such as ammonia and [[sodium azide]]);&lt;ref name=Wolfgang /&gt; including a reaction between the elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vepřek|first=S.|author2=Iqbal, Z. |author3=Brunner, J. |author4= Schärli, M. |title=Preparation and properties of amorphous phosphorus nitride prepared in a low-pressure plasma|journal=Philosophical Magazine B|date=1 March 1981|volume=43|issue=3|pages=527–547|doi=10.1080/01418638108222114|bibcode=1981PMagB..43..527V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:3 PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →   P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 15 HCl
:3 PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 15 NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →   P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 15 NaCl + 5 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Similar methods are used to prepared [[boron nitride]] (BN) and [[silicon nitride]] (Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); however the products are generally impure and [[amorphous]].&lt;ref name=Wolfgang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schnick|first=Wolfgang|title=Solid-State Chemistry with Nonmetal Nitrides|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English|date=1 June 1993|volume=32|issue=6|pages=806–818|doi=10.1002/anie.199308061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meng|first=Zhaoyu|author2=Peng, Yiya |author3=Yang, Zhiping |author4= Qian, Yitai |title=Synthesis and Characterization of Amorphous Phosphorus Nitride.|journal=Chemistry Letters|date=1 January 2000|issue=11|pages=1252–1253|doi=10.1246/cl.2000.1252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crystalline]] samples have been produced by the reaction of [[ammonium chloride]] and [[hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cm950385y |title=Phosphorus Nitride P3N5: Synthesis, Spectroscopic, and Electron Microscopic Investigations |date=1996 |last1=Schnick |first1=Wolfgang |last2=Lücke |first2=Jan |last3=Krumeich |first3=Frank |journal=Chemistry of Materials |volume=8 |pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[phosphorus pentachloride]].&lt;ref name=Wolfgang /&gt;

:(NPCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl   →   P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  +  8 HCl

:3 PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  +  5 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl   →   P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  +  20 HCl

P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; has also been prepared at room temperature, by a reaction between [[phosphorus trichloride]] and [[sodium amide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.inoche.2004.03.009 |title=Room temperature route to phosphorus nitride hollow spheres |date=2004 |last1=Chen |first1=Luyang |last2=Gu |first2=Yunle |last3=Shi |first3=Liang |last4=Yang |first4=Zeheng |last5=Ma |first5=Jianhua |last6=Qian |first6=Yitai |journal=Inorganic Chemistry Communications |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:3 PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →   P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  +  5 NaCl  +  4 HCl  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

== Reactions ==
P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is thermally less stable than either BN or Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, with [[decomposition reaction|decomposition]] to the elements occurring at temperatures above 850&amp;nbsp;°C:&lt;ref name = Wolfgang /&gt;

:2 P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  →   6 PN  +  2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
:4 PN   →   P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

It is resistant to weak acids and bases, and insoluble in water at room temperature, however it [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]] upon heating to form the ammonium phosphate salts [[Diammonium phosphate|(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Monoammonium phosphate|NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].

Triphosphorus pentanitride reacts with [[lithium nitride]] and [[calcium nitride]] to form the corresponding salts of PN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7−&lt;/sup&gt; and PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;. Heterogenous ammonolyses of triphosphorus pentanitride gives imides such as HPN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. It has been suggested that these compounds may have applications as [[solid electrolytes]] and [[pigment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schnick|first=Wolfgang|title=Phosphorus(V) Nitrides: Preparation, Properties, and Possible Applications of New Solid State Materials with Structural Analogies to Phosphates and Silicates|journal=Phosphorus, Sulfur, and Silicon and the Related Elements|date=1993|volume=76|issue=1-4|pages=183–186|doi=10.1080/10426509308032389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and properties ==
Several different [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] are known for triphosphorus pentanitride. The alpha‑form of triphosphorus pentanitride (α‑P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is encountered at atmospheric pressure and exists at pressures up to 6 [[Pascal (unit)|GPa]], at which point it converts to the gamma‑variety (γ‑P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) of the compound. [[Computational chemistry]] indicates that a third, delta‑variety (δ‑P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), will form at around 43 GPa with a [[Kyanite]]-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12203333 |date=2002 |last1=Kroll |first1=P |last2=Schnick |first2=W |title=A density functional study of phosphorus nitride P3N5: Refined geometries, properties, and relative stability of alpha-P3N5 and gamma-P3N5 and a further possible high-pressure phase delta-P3N5 with kyanite-type structure |volume=8 |issue=15 |pages=3530–7 |doi=10.1002/1521-3765(20020802)8:15&lt;3530::AID-CHEM3530&gt;3.0.CO;2-6 |journal=Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure  of α‑P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; has been determined by [[single crystal]] [[X-ray diffraction]], which showed a network structure of edge‑sharing PN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horstmann|first=Stefan|author2=Irran, Elisabeth |author3=Schnick, Wolfgang |title=Synthesis and Crystal Structure of Phosphorus(V) Nitrideα-P3N5|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English|date=1997|volume=36|issue=17|pages=1873–1875|doi=10.1002/anie.199718731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Triphosphorus pentanitride currently has no large scale applications although it had found use as a [[gettering]] material for [[incandescent lamps]]; replacing various mixtures containing [[red phosphorus]] in the late 1960s. The lighting filaments are dipped into a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] of P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; prior to being sealed into the bulb. After bulb closure, but whilst still on the pump, the lamps are lit, causing the P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; to thermally decompose into its constituent elements. Much of this is removed by the pump but enough P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; vapor remains to react with any residual oxygen inside the bulb. Once the vapor pressure of P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is low enough either filler gas is admitted to the bulb prior to sealing off or, if a vacuum atmosphere is desired the bulb is sealed off at that point. The high decomposition temperature of P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; allows sealing machines to run faster and hotter than was possible using red phosphorus.

Related halogen containing polymers, trimeric bromophosphonitrile, (PNBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, m.p.&amp;nbsp;192&amp;nbsp;°C and tetrameric bromophosphonitrile, (PNBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, m.p.&amp;nbsp;202&amp;nbsp;°C find similar lamp gettering applications for [[Halogen lamp|tungsten halogen lamps]], where they perform the dual processies of gettering and precise halogen dosing.

It has also been investigated as a new material for [[semiconductor]] based electronics; particularly as a gate insulator in [[Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor|metal-insulator-semiconductor devices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirota|first=Yukihiro|title=Chemical vapor deposition and characterization of phosphorus nitride (P3N5) gate insulators for InP metal-insulator-semiconductor devices|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=1982|volume=53|issue=7|pages=5037|doi=10.1063/1.331380|bibcode=1982JAP....53.5037H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jeong|first=Yoon-Ha|author2=Choi, Ki-Hwan |author3=Jo, Seong-Kue |author4= Kang, Bongkoo |title=Effects of Sulfide Passivation on the Performance of GaAs MISFETs with Photo-CVD Grown P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; Gate Insulators|journal=Japanese Journal of Applied Physics|date=1995|volume=34|issue=Part 1, No. 2B|pages=1176–1180|doi=10.1143/JJAP.34.1176|bibcode=1995JaJAP..34.1176J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[patent]]s have been filed for the use of triphosphorus pentanitride in fire fighting measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/WO1996010443|title = Phosphorus nitride agents to protect against fires and explosions|accessdate = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/4063883.html|title = Manufacture of flame-retardant regenerated cellulose fibres|date = December 20, 1977|accessdate = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23488">The '''WTA Rankings''' are the [[Sports rating system|ratings]] defined by the [[Women's Tennis Association]], introduced in November 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/rankings |title=WTA Rankings |publisher=Women's Tennis Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranking method==
The WTA rankings are based on a rolling 52-week, cumulative system. A player's ranking is determined by her results at a maximum of 16 tournaments for singles and 11 for doubles  and points are awarded based on how far a player advances in a tournament. The basis for calculating a player's ranking are those tournaments that yield the highest ranking points during the rolling 52-week period with the condition that they must include points from the 4 Grand Slams, the 4 Premier Mandatory tournaments and the WTA Finals. In addition, for Top 20 players, their best two results at Premier 5 tournaments will also count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WTA – All About Rankings|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/all-about-rankings#|publisher=WTA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 2016, the WTA also distributed ranking points, for singles players only, who competed at the [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nanjing.itftennis.com/olympics/players/ranking-points.aspx|accessdate=16 September 2014|title=Ranking Points|publisher=itftennis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has since been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/30/sports/tennis/points-and-prize-money-mean-more-to-olympic-tennis-holdouts.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The points distribution for tournaments in 2017 is shown below. [[2013 WTA Tour#Points distribution|Points earned in 2013]] were a little different in some cases and retained their value until they expired after 52 weeks.
