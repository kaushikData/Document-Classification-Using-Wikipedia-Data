'''Ibrahim''' ({{lang-ar|إِبْـرَاهِـيْـم|ʾIbrāhīm}}, {{IPA-ar|ʔɪbraːˈhiːm|pron}}), known as [[Abraham]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], is recognized as a [[prophets and messengers in Islam|prophet and messenger in Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|87|19|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|last=Siddiqui|first=Mona|authorlink=Mona Siddiqui|title=Ibrahim – the Muslim view of Abraham|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/ibrahim.shtml|work=Religions|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[God in Islam|God]]. Abraham plays a prominent role as an example of faith in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and Islam. In [[Muslim]] belief, [[Abraham]] fulfilled all the commandments and trials wherein God nurtured him throughout his lifetime. As a result of his unwavering faith in God, Ibrahim was promised by God to be a leader to all the nations of the world.&lt;ref name="q2s124"&gt;{{Cite quran|2|124|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quran]] extols Ibrahim as a model, an exemplar, obedient and not an idolater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|16|120|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Abraham has been described as representing "primordial man in universal surrender to the Divine Reality before its fragmentation into religions separated from each other by differences in form".&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', C. Glasse, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic holy day [[Eid al-Adha]] is celebrated in memory of the sacrifice of Abraham, and each able bodied Muslim is supposed to perform the pilgrimage to pay homage at the [[Ka‘bah]] ({{lang-ar|كَـعـبَـة}}) in the [[Hijaz]]i city of [[Mecca]], which was built by Abraham and his son Ishmael as the first house of worship on earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', C. Glasse, ''Kaaba''&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that the prophet Abraham became the leader of the righteous in his time, and that it was through him that [[Adnanite]]-[[Arabs]], [[Romans]] and [[Israelites]] came. Abraham, in the belief of Islam, was instrumental in cleansing the world of idolatry at the time. [[Paganism]] was cleared out by Abraham in both the [[Arabian peninsula]] and [[Canaan]]. He spiritually purified both places as well as physically sanctifying the houses of worship. Abraham and [[Ishmael in Islam|Ismā‘īl]] ({{lang-ar|إِسـمَـاعِـيـل}}, [[Ishmael]]) further established the rites of [[pilgrimage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|128|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Ḥajj]]'' ({{lang-ar|حَـجّ}}), which are still followed by Muslims today. Muslims maintain that Abraham further asked God to bless both the lines of his progeny, of Ismail and [[Isaac in Islam|Isḥāq]] ({{lang-ar|إِسـحَـاق}}, [[Isaac]]), and to keep all of his descendants in the protection of God.

==Family==
[[Muslim]]s maintain that Abraham's father was [[Terah#Islamic tradition|Aazar]] ({{lang-ar|آزر|Āzar}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prophet|first=Ibrahim|title=Father|url=http://www.islamicity.com/mosque/ibrahim.htm|publisher=Islamicity|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ibrahim|first=Prophet|title=Father|url=http://www.haqislam.org/prophet-ibrahim-1/|publisher=Haq Islam|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could be derived from the Syriac ''Athar'',&lt;ref&gt;Geiger 1898 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4d81AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA101 ''Judaism and Islam: A Prize Essay''], p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; who is known in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as [[Terah]]. Abraham had two children, Isaac and Ishmael, who both later became prophets. Abraham's two wives are believed to have been [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar in Islam|Hājar]], the latter of whom was originally Sarah's [[handmaiden]].&lt;ref&gt;Lings, Martin. "Muhammad". ''House of God'' Chap. I (cf. Index: "Abraham"), Suhail Academy Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham's nephew is said to have been the messenger [[Lot in Islam|Lut]] ([[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]), who was one of the other people who migrated with Abraham out of their community. Abraham himself is said to have been a descendant of [[Noah in Islam|Nuh]] through his son [[Shem]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ibrahim". ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', Online version.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality and wisdom==
Abraham's personality and character is one of the most in-depth in the whole Quran, and Abraham is specifically mentioned as being a kind and compassionate man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|11|75|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham's father is understood by Muslims to have been a wicked, ignorant and idolatrous man who ignored all of his son's advice. The relationship between Abraham and his father, who in the Quran is named Azar, is central to Abraham's story as Muslims understand it to establish a large part of Abraham's personality. The Quran mentions that Abraham's father threatened to stone his son to death if he did not cease in preaching to the people.&lt;ref name="q19s46"&gt;{{Cite quran|19|46|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the Qur'an states that Abraham in his later years prayed to God to forgive the sins of all his descendants and his parents. Muslims have frequently cited Abraham's character as an example of how kind one must be towards people, and especially one's own parents. A similar example of Abraham's compassionate nature is demonstrated when Abraham began to pray for the people of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] after hearing of God's plan through the angel Gabriel for them. Although the angel Gabriel told Abraham that God's plan was the final word, and therefore Abraham's prayers would be of no effect, the Quran nonetheless reinforces Abraham's kind nature through this particular event.&lt;ref&gt;''Lives of the Prophets'', L. Azzam, Suhail Academy Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life according to the Quran and Islamic tradition==

===Youth===
[[File:20160105-Abraham house in Ur Iraq.jpg|thumb|Ruins in the [[ancient Iraq]]i city of [[Ur]], 2016]]

Ibrahim was born in a house of [[Idolatry|idolaters]] in the ancient city of [[Ur Kaśdim#Islamic|Ur of the Chaldees]], likely the place called '[[Ur]]' in present-day [[Iraq]], in which case, the idolaters would have been practitioners of the hypothesized [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion]].&lt;ref name="Brit, AMR"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jacobsen, Thorkild |title=Mesopotamian religion |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mesopotamian-religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Azar was a well-known [[Shirk (Islam)|idol-sculptor]] that his people worshiped. As a young child, Ibrahim used to watch his father sculpting these idols from stones or wood. When his father was finished with them, Ibrahim would ask his father why they could not move or respond to any request and then would mock them; therefore, his father would always ground him for not following his ancestors's rituals and mocking their idols.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2637&amp;Itemid=76 abraham opposition to idols&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his opposition to idolatry, his father Azar would still send Ibrahim to sell his idols in the marketplace. Once there, Ibraham would call out to passersby, "Who will buy my idols? They will not help you and they cannot hurt you! Who will buy my idols?" Then Ibrahim would mock the idols. He would take them to the river, push their faces into the water and command them, "Drink! Drink!" Once again, Ibrahim asked his father, "How can you worship what does not see or hear or do you any good?" Azar replied, "Dare you deny the gods of our people? Get out of my sight!" Ibrahim replied, "May God forgive you. No more will I live with you and your idols." After this, Ibrahim left his father's home for good.

During one of the many festivals that would take place in the city, the people would gather in their temple and place offerings of food before their idols. Ur's most prominent temple is the [[Ziggurat of Ur|Great Ziggurat]], which can be seen today.&lt;ref name="Zettler, R.L. 1998"&gt;Zettler, R.L. and Horne, L. (eds.) 1998. ''Treasures from the Royal Tombs of Ur'', University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim would ask them, "What are you worshiping? Do these idols hear when you call them? Can they help you or hurt you?" The people would reply, "It is the way of our forefathers." Ibrahim declared "I am sick of your gods! Truly I am their enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaronshep.com/stories/035.html|title=Abraham and the Idols (Middle Eastern, Islamic, Muslim Legends, Stories)|work=aaronshep.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years, Ibrahim became a young man. He still could not believe that his people were worshipping the statues. He laughed whenever he saw them entering the temple, lowering their heads, silently offering the statues the best of their food, crying and asking forgiveness from them. He started feeling angry towards his people, who could not realize that these are only stones that could neither benefit nor harm them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalsofindia.in/Deites/OtherReligions/Ibrahim.aspx|title=Ibrahim - Father of Prophets - Prophets of Muslim community - Prophet Ibrahim|author=Pan India Internet Pvt Ltd.|work=festivalsofindia.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Searching for the truth===
One night, Ibrahim went up to the mountain, leaned against a rock, and looked up to the sky. He saw a shining star and said to himself, "Could this be my Lord?" But when it set he said: "I don't like those that set." The star had disappeared so it could not be God. God is always present. Then he saw the moon rising in splendor and said, "Could this be my Lord?" but the moon also set. At daybreak, he saw the sun rising and said, "Could this be my Lord? This is the biggest and brightest!" But when the sun also set he said, "O my people! I am free from all that you join as [[Shirk (Islam)|partners with Allah]]! I have turned my face towards Allah who created the heavens and the earth and never shall I associate partners with Allah. Our Lord is the creator of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He has the power to make the stars rise and set." After this declaration, Ibrahim then heard Allah calling him, "O Ibrahim!" Ibrahim trembled and said, "Here I am O my Lord!" Allah replied, "Submit to Me! Be a Muslim!" Ibrahim fell to the ground, crying. He said: "I submit to the Lord of the universe!" Ibrahim kept prostrating himself until nightfall. He then got up and went back to his home, in peace and full of conviction that Allah has guided him to the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionislam.com/comprel/ProphetIbrahim.htm|title=Prophet Ibrahim The Father of all the Prophets|work=missionislam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new life started for Ibrahim. His mission now was to call his people to [[monotheism]]. He started with his father, the closest person to him and whom he loved greatly. He said to him in the softest and kindest voice: "O father! Why do you worship that which doesn't hear, doesn't see, and cannot avail you in anything? O father, I have got knowledge which you have not, so follow me. I will guide you to a straight path." His father replied angrily: "Do you reject my gods, O Ibrahim? If you don't stop I will [[Stoning|stone you to death!]] Get away from me before I punish you!" Ibrahim replied: "Peace be on you! I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you."

===The great fire===
The decision to have Ibrahim [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] was affirmed by the temple priests and the king of Babylon, [[Nimrod]]. The news spread like fire in the kingdom and people were coming from all places to watch the execution. A huge pit was dug up and a large quantity of wood was piled up. Then the biggest fire people ever witnessed was lit. The flames were so high up in the sky that even the birds could not fly over it for fear of being burnt themselves. Ibrahim's hands and feet were chained, and he was put in a [[catapult]], ready to be thrown in. During this time, Angel [[Jibril]] came to him and said: "O Ibrahim! Is there anything you wish for?" Ibrahim could have asked to be saved from the fire or to be taken away, but Ibrahim replied, "Allah is sufficient for me, He is the best disposer of my affairs." The catapult was released and Ibrahim was thrown into the fire. Allah then gave an order to the fire, "O fire! Be coolness and safety for Ibrahim." A miracle occurred, the fire obeyed and burned only his chains. Ibrahim came out from it as if he was coming out from a garden, peaceful, his face illuminated and not a trace of smoke on his clothes. People watched in shock and exclaimed: "Amazing! Ibrahim's God has saved him from the fire!"

===Confrontation with Nimrod===
The Qur'an discusses a certain conversation between an unrighteous ruler and Abraham. Although identification for the unnamed king has been recognized as being least important in the narrative, many historical sources suggest that it was [[Nimrod]],&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Prophets and Kings'', [[Tabari]], Vol. I: ''Prophets and Patriarchs''&lt;/ref&gt; the king who had ordered the building of the [[Tower of Babel]].

According to the narrative, Nimrod became extremely arrogant due to his wealth and power, to the point that he made the claim that he possessed the power of [[Creation myth|creation]]. Claiming [[divinity]] for himself, Nimrod quarreled with Ibrahim, but the Qur'an describes that he only deepened in confusion. According to [[Roman Jews|Romano-Jewish]] historian [[Flavius Josephus]], Nimrod was a man who set his will against that of God. Nimrod proclaimed himself as a living god and was worshipped as such by his subjects. Nimrod's consort [[Semiramis]] was also worshipped as a goddess at his side. (See also [[Ninus]].) Before Abraham was born, a portent in the stars tells Nimrod and his [[Astrology|astrologers]] of the impending birth of Abraham, who would put an end to [[idolatry]]. Nimrod therefore orders the [[Infanticide|killing of all newborn babies]]. However, Abraham's mother escapes into the fields and gives birth secretly.

Flavius Josephus mentions that Abraham confronts Nimrod and tells him face-to-face to cease his idolatry, whereupon Nimrod orders him [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]]. Nimrod has his subjects gather enough wood so as to burn Abraham in the biggest fire the world had ever seen. Yet when the fire is lit and Abraham is thrown into it, Abraham walks out unscathed. In Islam, it is debated whether the decision to have Ibrahim burned at the stake came from Nimrod and the temple priests or whether the people themselves became [[Vigilantism|vigilantes]] and hatched the plan to have him burned at the stake.

According to Muslim commentators, after Ibrahim survived the great fire, notoriety in society grew bigger after this event. Nimrod, who was the King of [[Babylon]] felt that his throne was in danger, and that he was losing power because upon witnessing Ibrahim coming out of the fire unharmed, a large part of society started believing in [[Allah]] and Ibrahim being a [[Prophets in Islam|prophet of Allah]]. Up until this point, Nimrod was pretending that he himself was a God. Nimrod wanted to debate with him and show his people that he, the king is indeed the god and that Ibrahim was a liar. Nimrod asked Ibrahim, "What can your God do that I cannot?" Ibrahim replied, "My Lord is He who gives life and death." Nimrod then shouted, "I give life and death! I can bring a person from the street and have him executed, and I can grant my pardon to a person who was sentenced to death and save his life." Ibrahim replied, "Well, my lord Allah makes the sun rise from the East. Can you make it rise from the West?" Nimrod was confounded. He was beaten at his own game, on his own territory and in front of his own people. Prophet Ibrahim left him there speechless and went back to his important mission, calling people to worship the one and only God, Allah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicity.com/media/ancmts/docum1.htm|title=The Father of the Prophets|work=islamicity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Prophets/ibrahim.html|title=Ibn Kathir: Story of Prophet Ibrahim/Abraham (pbuh)|work=islamawareness.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This event has been noted as particularly important because, in the Muslim perspective, it almost foreshadowed the prophetic careers of future prophets, most significantly the career of Moses. Abraham's quarrel with the king has been interpreted by some to be a precursor to Moses's preaching to [[Fir'awn|Pharaoh]]. Just as the ruler who argued against Abraham claimed divinity for himself, so did the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]], who refused to hear the call of Moses and perished in the [[Red Sea]]. In this particular incident, scholars have further commented on Abraham's wisdom in employing "rational, wise and target-oriented" speech, as opposed to pointless arguments.&lt;ref&gt;''Book 1: The Prophet Abraham'', Harun Yahya, ''The Unbeliever Advised By Abraham'', Online. web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham, in the eyes of many Muslims, also symbolized the highest moral values essential to any person. The Qur'an details the account of the [[angel]]s coming to Abraham to tell him of the birth of Isaac. It says that, as soon as Abraham saw the messengers, he "hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf."&lt;ref name="q11s69"&gt;{{Cite quran|11|69|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action has been interpreted by all the scholars as exemplary; many scholars have commentated upon this one action, saying that it symbolizes Abraham's exceedingly high moral level and thus is a model for how men should act in a similar situation. This incident has only further heightened the "compassionate" character of Abraham in [[Islamic theology|Muslim theology]].&lt;ref&gt;''Book 1: The Prophet Abraham'', Harun Yahya, ''Angels Who Visited Abraham'', Online. web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacrifice===
[[File:Timurid_Anthology_Zhertva.jpg|thumb|Ibrahim's Sacrifice. Timurid Anthology, 1410-11.]]

In the mainstream narrative, it is assumed that Abraham's dream of sacrificing his son was a command by God. The verse in reference (i.e. 37:104-105) is in Surah As-Saffat and the quoted ayahs are translated by known Islamic scholar Abul A'la Maududi as "We cried out O' Ibraheem you have indeed fulfilled your dream. Thus do we award the good do-ers."

It is assumed that Abraham dreamt that God ordered him to sacrifice his son Ishmael, he agreed to follow God's command and perform the sacrifice, however, God intervened and informed him that his sacrifice had been accepted. Unlike the Bible, there is no mention in the Qur'an of an animal (ram) replacing the boy, rather he is replaced with a 'great sacrifice' (''Zibhin azeem'').&lt;ref name="Cite quran|37|100|e=111|s=ns"&gt;{{Cite quran|37|100|e=111|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the sacrifice of a ram cannot be greater than that of Abraham's son (and a prophet in Islam at that), this replacement seems to point to either the religious institutionalization of sacrifice itself, or to the future self-sacrifices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions (who were destined to emerge from the progeny of Ishmael) in the cause of their faith. From that day onwards, every [[Eid al-Adha]] once a year Muslims around the world slaughter an animal to commemorate Abraham's sacrifice and to remind themselves of self-abnegation in the way of Allah. This is called [[Qurbani]] ("sacrifice").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaiil.org/text/books/mga/khutbahilhamiyya/khutbahilhamiyyadeepermeaningsacrifice.pdf Deeper Meaning of Sacrifice in Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the words of the Qur'an never explicitly state that Abraham's dream was a Divine command. The Quran only states that Abraham had a dream, which he interpreted as a command from God, and Abraham was eventually stopped by God Himself from "sacrificing" his son. This is in stark contrast to the Jewish/Christian narratives, and also some non-mainstream Sunni/Shia narratives which assume the biblical narrative is true. According to these views, the problem with this interpretation is that it yields a logical contradiction, as it is clearly stated that no life can be taken without a just cause, and there was no just cause for Abraham to take the life of his son.

There are non-mainstream expositions of the Qur'an which harmonize the incident of Abraham's sacrifice and make the narrative of these verses consistent with the Quran's own laws, such as the one by [[Ghulam Ahmed Pervez]], who translates the key verses as follows: 'We immediately removed this thought from Abraham’s mind and called out to him, O Abraham. You considered your dream as Allah's command and laid your son for the purpose of slaughtering him! This was not Our command, but merely a dream of yours. Therefore, We have saved you and your son from this. We have done so because We keep those who lead their lives according to Divine guidance safe from such mishaps.' (37: 104-105).&lt;ref name="tolueislam.org"&gt;http://tolueislam.org/exposition-of-the-holy-quran-37-as-saaffaat-g-a-parwez/&lt;/ref&gt; As for the term "sacrifice", the meaning of this term as it relates to Ishmael in the following verses is explained as: "As far as the son is concerned, We saved him for a far greater and tremendous sacrifice. (This great sacrifice refers to the fact that instead of keeping his leadership confined to [[Syria (region)|Syria]], We wanted him to become the custodian of Our House the Ka'bah, which was located in the far off barren land of Arabia and which had to become the center and gathering place of all those the world over, who believed in the unity of God (internal reference 14:37))."&lt;ref name="tolueislam.org"/&gt;

===Miracles===
Abraham encountered several miracles of God during his lifetime. The Qur'an records a few main miracles, although different interpretations have been attributed to the passages. Some of the miracles recorded in the Quran are:
* Abraham was shown the kingdom of the [[Heaven]]s and the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|6|75|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Abraham and the miracle of the birds.&lt;ref name="q2s260"&gt;{{cite quran|2|260|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Abraham was thrown into a fire, which became "cool" and "peaceful" for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|21|68|e=70|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first passage has been interpreted both literally, allegorically and otherwise. Although some commentators feel that this passage referred to a physical miracle, where Abraham was physically shown the entire kingdom of Heaven ([[Jannah]]),&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Certainty'', M. Lings, S. Academy Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; others have felt that it refers to the spiritual understanding of Abraham; these latter scholars maintain that the [[Babylon|Chaldeans]] were skilled in the observance of the stars, but Abraham, who lived amongst them, saw beyond the physical world and into a higher spiritual realm. The second passage has one mainstream interpretation amongst the [[Tafsir|Qur'anic commentators]], that Abraham took four birds and cut them up, placing pieces of each on nearby hills; when he called out to them, each piece joined and four birds flew back to Abraham.&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', Kisa'i/Kathir, ''Story of Abraham''&lt;/ref&gt; This miracle, as told by the Qur'anic passage, was a demonstration by God to show Abraham how God gave life to the dead. As the physical cutting of the birds is not implied in the passage, some commentators have offered alternative interpretations, but all maintain that the miracle was for the same demonstrative purpose to show Abraham the power God has to raise the dead to life.&lt;ref&gt;Quran: Text, Translation, Commentary, ''Abdullah Yusuf Ali'', note. 285&lt;/ref&gt; The third passage has also been interpreted both literally and metaphorically, or in some cases both. Commentators state that the 'fire' refers to main aspects. They maintained that, firstly, the fire referred to the physical flame, from which Abraham was saved unharmed. The commentators further stated that, secondly, the fire referred to the 'fire of persecution', from which Abraham was saved, as he left his people after this with his wife Sarah and his nephew Lot.&lt;ref&gt;Quran: Text, Translation, Commentary, ''Abdullah Yusuf Ali'', note. 2703&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
Abraham is given the title '''Khalilullah''' ({{lang-ar|خلیل‌ الله|Ḫalīl Allāḥ|lit=Friend of [[Allah]]}}) in Islam.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title|url=http://www.answering-islam.org/Gilchrist/Vol2/4a.html|publisher=Answering Islam|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran says:
{{Quote|Who can be better in religion than one who submits his whole self to [[Allah]], does good, and follows the way of Abraham the true in Faith? For Allah did take Abraham for a friend.|Qur’an, sura 4 ([[An-Nisa]]) [[ayat]] 125&lt;ref name="q4s125"&gt;{{Cite quran|4|125|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This particular title of Abraham is so famous in [[Islamic culture|Muslim culture]] and tradition that, in the areas in and around Mecca, Abraham is often referred to solely as ''The Friend''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mecca: From Before Genesis Until Now'', M. Lings. Archetype Books&lt;/ref&gt; This title of ''Friend of God'' is not exclusive to Islamic theology. Although the other religious traditions do not stress upon it, Abraham is called a ''Friend of God'' in the second [[Books of Chronicles|Book of Chronicles]] and the [[Book of Isaiah]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Old Testament]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Isaiah|41:8}} and {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|20:7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||James|2:23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Abraham's most important features in Islamic [[theology]] is his role as the constructor of the Kaaba. Although tradition recounts that [[Adam in Islam|Adam]] constructed the original Kaaba, which was demolished by the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]] at the time of Noah, Abraham is believed to have rebuilt it in its original form. The Qur'an, in the Muslim perspective, merely confirms or reinforces the laws of [[pilgrimage#Islam|pilgrimage]]. The rites were instituted by Abraham and for all Muslims, as they perform the pilgrimage, the event is a way to return to the perfection of Abraham's faith.&lt;ref name="Lings"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lings |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Lings |title=[[Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources]] |publisher=Islamic Texts Society |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-946621-33-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as [[Medina]] is referred to as the "City of the Prophet [Muhammad]" or simply the "City of Muhammad", Mecca is frequently cited as the "City of Abraham", because Abraham's reformation of the monotheistic faith is believed to have taken place in Mecca.&lt;ref name="Glasse"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Glassé |first=Cyril |title=Kaaba |work=The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam |publisher=[[HarperSanFrancisco]] |year=1991 |url=https://books.google.ae/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=dlPuAAAAMAAJ |isbn=0060631260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scrolls of Abraham==
{{Main|Scrolls of Abraham (Islam)}}
The Qur'an refers to certain [[Scrolls of Abraham (Islam)|Scrolls of Abraham]], which have alternatively been translated as the ''Books of Abraham''. All Muslim scholars have generally agreed that no scrolls of Abraham survive, and therefore this is a reference to a lost body of scripture.&lt;ref&gt;''A-Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', B. M. Wheeler, ''Abraham''&lt;/ref&gt; The Scrolls of Abraham are understood by Muslims to refer to certain revelations Abraham received, which he would have then transmitted to writing. The exact contents of the revelation are not described in the Qur'an.

The 87th chapter of the Qur'an, Surat [[Al-Ala]], concludes saying the subject matter of the sura has been in the earlier scriptures of Abraham and Moses. It is slightly indicative of what were in the previous scriptures, according to Islam:
{{quote|Therefore give admonition in case the admonition profits (the hearer).&lt;br&gt;The admonition will be received by those who fear (Allah):&lt;br&gt;But it will be avoided by those most unfortunate ones,&lt;br&gt;Who will enter the Great Fire,&lt;br&gt;In which they will then neither die nor live.&lt;br&gt;But those will prosper who purify themselves,&lt;br&gt;And glorify the name of their Guardian-Lord, and (lift their hearts) in prayer.&lt;br&gt;Nay (behold), ye prefer the life of this world;&lt;br&gt;But the Hereafter is better and more enduring.&lt;br&gt;And this is in the Books of the earliest (Revelation),-&lt;br&gt;The Books of Abraham and Moses.|Quran, sura 87 (Al-Ala), ayah 9-19 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|87|9|e=19|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chapter 53 of the Qur'an, sura [[An-Najm]], mentions some more subject matters of the earlier scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
{{quote|Nay, is he not acquainted with what is in the [[Tawrat|Books of Moses]]-&lt;br&gt;And of Abraham who fulfilled his engagements?-&lt;br&gt;Namely, that no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another;&lt;br&gt;That man can have nothing but what he strives for;&lt;br&gt;That (the fruit of) his striving will soon come in sight:&lt;br&gt;Then will he be rewarded with a reward complete;&lt;br&gt;That to thy Lord is the final Goal;&lt;br&gt;That it is He Who granteth Laughter and Tears;&lt;br&gt;That it is He Who granteth Death and Life;&lt;br&gt;That He did create in pairs,- male and female,&lt;br&gt;From a seed when lodged (in its place);&lt;br&gt;That He hath promised a Second Creation ([[Resurrection of the dead|Raising of the Dead]]);&lt;br&gt;That it is He Who giveth wealth and satisfaction;&lt;br&gt;That He is the Lord of [[Sirius]] (the Mighty Star);&lt;br&gt;And that it is He Who destroyed the (powerful) ancient [[ʿĀd|'Ad]] (people),&lt;br&gt;And the [[Thamud]] nor gave them a lease of perpetual life.&lt;br&gt;And before them, the people of Noah, for that they were (all) most unjust and most insolent transgressors,&lt;br&gt;And He destroyed the Overthrown Cities (of Sodom and Gomorrah).&lt;br&gt;So that (ruins unknown) have covered them up.&lt;br&gt;Then which of the gifts of thy Lord, (O man,) wilt thou dispute about?&lt;br&gt;This is a Warner, of the (series of) Warners of old!&lt;br&gt;The (Judgment) ever approaching draws nigh:&lt;br&gt;No (soul) but Allah can lay it bare.&lt;br&gt;Do ye then wonder at this recital?&lt;br&gt;And will ye laugh and not weep,-&lt;br&gt;Wasting your time in vanities?&lt;br&gt;But fall ye down in prostration to Allah, and adore (Him)!|Quran 53 (An-Najm), [[ayat]] 36-62 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|53|36|e=62|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet some scholars{{By whom|date=March 2012}} suggested it to be a reference to [[Sefer Yetzirah]], as [[Judaism|Jewish tradition]] generally ascribed{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} its authorship to Abraham. Other scholars, however, wrote of a certain [[Testament of Abraham]], which they explained was available at the time of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tafsir'' and Commentary on 87: 18-19 &amp; 53: 36-37, Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Muhammad Asad&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these views are disputed. And if those would have existed, according to clear instructions in the Quran and [[hadith]], no verification should take place.

The Quran contains numerous references to Abraham, his life, prayers and traditions and has a dedicated chapter named [[Ibrahim (sura)|Ibrahim]]. On a relevant note, sura [[Al-Kahf]] was revealed as an answer from God to the [[Jews]] who inquired of Muhammad about past events. Here God directly instructed Muhammad in sura Al-Kahf, not to consult the Jews for verifying the three stories about which they inquired.
{{quote|Enter not, therefore, into controversies concerning them, except on a matter that is clear, nor consult any of them about (the affair of) the Sleepers.| Quran, sura 18 (Al-Kahf), ayat 22 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|18|22|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The reason being God declaring He Himself is relating what needs to be verified in another verse of sura Al-Kahf:
{{Quote|We relate to thee their story in truth: they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We advanced them in guidance:|Quran, sura 18, (Al-Kahf), ayat 13&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|18|13|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Regarding consultation with the ''[[People of the Book]]'', it is also narrated by [[Abu Hurairah]] in Hadith literature:
{{Quote|Narrated Abu Huraira: The people of the Scripture (Jews) used to recite the [[Torah]] in Hebrew and they used to explain it in Arabic to the Muslims. On that Allah's Apostle said, "Do not believe the people of the Scripture or disbelieve them, but say:-- "We believe in Allah and what is revealed to us."|[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]|''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|6|60|12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Therefore, relating to any ascription of the Scrolls of Abraham by the people of the book is not required.

==Significance as a patriarch==
{{Main|Ishmael in Islam|Isaac in Islam}}
{{Six Islamic Prophets}}

Abraham is also extremely important as a leader of Islam and as a patriarch of the Islamic faith. Muslims recognize Abraham as the ancestor through whom many other prophets and [[saint]]s (''[[Wali]]'') came, including Moses, [[Jesus]] ([[Jesus in Islam|Isa]]) and Muhammad. The Quran lists, in the sixth chapter, some of the greatest figures to have through Abraham's progeny:
{{quote|That was the reasoning about Us, which We gave to Abraham (to use) against his people: We raise whom We will, degree after degree: for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge.&lt;br&gt;We gave him Isaac and Jacob: all (three) guided: and before him, We guided Noah, and among his progeny, [[David]] and [[Solomon]] and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] and [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] and Moses and [[Aaron]]: thus do We reward those who do good:&lt;br&gt;And [[Zechariah (priest)|Zakariya]] and [[John the Baptist|John]], and Jesus and [[Elijah|Elias]]: all in the ranks of the righteous:&lt;br&gt;And Isma'il and [[Elisha]], and [[Jonah]], and Lot: and to all We gave favour above the nations:&lt;br&gt;(To them) and to their fathers, and progeny and brethren: We chose them, and we guided them to a straight way.|Qur’an, sura 6 ([[Al-An'am]]), ayat 83-87&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|6|83|e=87|s=ns}}. See also [[Islamic view of David]], [[Islamic view of Solomon]], [[Job (prophet)]] and [[Islamic view of Joseph]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Abraham's narrative in the Quran indirectly refers to his role as one of the great patriarchs. The Qur'an says that God made Abraham "an [[Imam]] to the Nations.",&lt;ref name="q2s124"/&gt; Father of Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|22|78|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his narrative records him praying for his offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|14|35|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran further states that Abraham's descendants were given "the Book and Wisdom,",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|4|54|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this fact is reinforced in a verse which states that Abraham's family was one of those in which the gift of [[prophecy]] was established as a generic trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|58|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran emphasizes upon Abraham's significance as it states that Abraham's family, Noah, Adam and the family of [[Amram]] were the four selected by God above all the worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|33|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his significance as a patriarch, Abraham is sometimes given the misleading title ''Father of the Prophets'', which contradicts the teachings of the Quran, which establishes that many prophets, such as Noah, lived before Abraham. Of Abraham's immediate sons, the Quran repeatedly establishes the gifts God bestowed upon them. Ishmael, along with Elisha and [[Dhul-Kifl]] (possibly [[Ezekiel]]), is regarded as being "of the Company of the Good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|38|48|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the men who was given "favour above the nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|6|86|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Ishmael is described as being "true to what he promised, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet."&lt;ref name="q19s54"&gt;{{Cite quran|19|54|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Quran says of Isaac that he was "of the company of the Elect and the Good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|38|47|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was "a prophet,- one of the Righteous."&lt;ref name="q37s112"&gt;{{Cite quran|37|112|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further describes him as "of Power and Vision."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|38|45|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commemoration===
Abraham is commemorated by all Muslims. As is the case with every prophet and apostle, it is Islamic custom to say "[[Peace be upon him (Islam)|Peace be upon him]]" after saying Abraham's name. Abraham's unique position as the constructor of the Ka‘bah, as well as the establisher of the pilgrimage rites, is indirectly commemorated when Muslims perform the pilgrimage, or Hajj, in Mecca. Muslims sacrifice (Qurban) a domestic animal on Eid al-Adha, which is done in part to remember Abraham's bravery during his trial of the near-sacrifice of his son. Muslims further mention Abraham in their canonical prayer everyday, in which they ask God to bless Muhammad's family as He blessed Abraham's family.

Muslims believe that Ibrahim was buried, along with his wife Sarah, at the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] in [[Hebron]].

===References to Abraham===
There are numerous references to Abraham in the Quran, including, twice, to the Scrolls of Abraham;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|87|18|e=19|s=ns}} and {{Cite quran|53|36|e=37|s=ns|b=n}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the latter passage, it is mentioned that Abraham "fulfilled his engagements?-",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|53|37|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to all the trials that Abraham had succeeded in. In a whole series of chapters, the Qur'an relates how Abraham preached to his community as a youth and how he specifically told his father, named Azar,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|6|74|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; to leave idol-worship and come to the [[God in Abrahamic religions|worship of God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|37|83|e=89|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|26|68|e=89|b=n|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|19|41|e=50|s=ns|b=n}}, {{Cite quran|43|26|e=28|b=n|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|21|51|e=73|b=n|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|29|16|e=28|b=n|s=ns}} and {{Cite quran|6|74|e=84|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some passages of the Quran, meanwhile, deal with the story of how God sent angels to Abraham with the announcement of the punishment to be imposed upon Lot's people in Sodom and Gomorrah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|52|24|e=34|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|25|51|e=60|b=n|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|11|69|e=76|b=n|s=ns}} and {{Cite quran|29|31|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other verses mention the near-sacrifice of Abraham's son,&lt;ref name="Cite quran|37|100|e=111|s=ns"/&gt; whose name is not given but is presumed to be Ishmael as the following verses mention the birth of Isaac.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', C. Glasse, ''Ishmael''&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran also repeatedly establishes Abraham's role as patriarch and mentions numerous important descendants who came through his lineage, including Isaac,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|25|53|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|29|49|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|21|72|b=n|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|29|27|b=n|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|6|84|b=n|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|11|71|b=n|s=ns}} and {{Cite quran|38|45|e=47|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ishmael.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|132|e=133|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later chapters of the Quran, Abraham's role becomes yet more prominent. The Quran mentions that Abraham and Ishmael were the reformers who set up the Ka‘bah in Mecca as a center of pilgrimage for monotheism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|123|e=141|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|3|65|e=68|b=n|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|3|95|e=97|b=n|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|4|125|b=n|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|4|26|e=29|b=n|s=ns}} and {{Cite quran|22|78|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran consistently refers to Islam as "the Religion of Abraham" (''millat Ibrahim'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|135|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Abraham is given a title as ''[[Hanif]]'' (''The Pure'', "true in Faith" or "upright man").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|67|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran also mentions Abraham as one whom God took as a friend (''Khalil''),&lt;ref name="q4s125"/&gt; hence Abraham's title in Islam, ''Khalil-Allah'' (''Friend of God''). The term is considered by some to be a derivation of the patriarch's title, ''Qal El'' ({{lang-he|קל-אל}}, "Voice of God").&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Simcha (2006). Up, Up, and Oy Vey! (1st ed.). Leviathan Press. {{ISBN|978-1-881927-32-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Digest (Aug, 2006; posted online 25 July 2006): "Superman's Other Secret Identity", by Jeff Fleischer&lt;/ref&gt; Other instances in the Quran which are described in a concise manner are the rescue of Abraham from the fire into which he was thrown by his people';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|37|97|s=ns}} and {{Cite quran|21|68|e=70|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|21|51|e=73|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; his pleading for his father;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|28|47|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; his quarrel with an unrighteous and powerful king&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|58|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the miracle of the dead birds.&lt;ref name="q2s260"/&gt;

All these events and more have been discussed with more details in Muslim tradition, and especially in the ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]'' and works of universal Islamic theology.&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, ''Ibrahim''; ''Tales of the Prophets'', Kisa'i, ''Ibrahim''&lt;/ref&gt; Certain episodes from the life of Abraham have been more heavily detailed in Islamic text, such as the arguments between Abraham and the evil king, Nimrod, the near-sacrifice of his son, and the story of Hagar and Ishmael, which Muslims commemorate when performing [[pilgrimage]] in Mecca. An important [[Muslim holidays|Islamic religious holiday]], Eid al-Adha, commemorates Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to God, before God intervened to provide him with a sheep to sacrifice instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.kumc.edu/diversity/ethnic_relig/eid-al-adha.html Diversity Calendar: Eid al-Adha] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019040746/http://www3.kumc.edu/diversity/ethnic_relig/eid-al-adha.html |date=19 October 2012 }} University of Kansas Medical Center&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, some believe these legends in Islamic text may have influenced later Jewish tradition.&lt;ref&gt;J.

The '''Absolute Infinite''' (''symbol'': Ω) is an extension of the idea of [[infinity]] proposed by [[mathematician]] [[Georg Cantor]].

It can be thought as a number which is bigger than any conceivable or inconceivable quantity, either finite or [[transfinite number|transfinite]].

Cantor linked the Absolute Infinite with [[God]],&lt;ref&gt;§3.2, {{cite journal
 | author=Ignacio Jané
 | title=The role of the absolute infinite in Cantor's conception of set
 | journal=Erkenntnis
 | volume=42 | issue=3 |date=May 1995 | pages=375–402 | doi=10.1007/BF01129011 | quote=Cantor (1) took the absolute to be a manifestation of God [...] When the absolute is first introduced in Grundlagen, it is linked to God: "the true infinite or absolute, which is in God, admits no kind of determination" (Cantor 1883b, p. 175) This is not an incidental remark, for Cantor is very explicit and insistent about the relation between the absolute and God.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that it had various [[mathematical]] properties, including the [[reflection principle]]: every property of the Absolute Infinite is also held by some smaller object.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinity: New Research and Frontiers'' by Michael Heller and W. Hugh Woodin (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PVNbIGS37wMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cantor's view ==
Cantor said:

{{quote|The actual infinite was distinguished by three relations: first, as it is realized in the supreme perfection, in the completely independent, extraworldly existence, in Deo, where I call it absolute infinite or simply absolute; second to the extent that it is represented in the dependent, creatural world; third as it can be conceived in abstracto in thought as a mathematical magnitude, number or ordertype. In the latter two relations, where it obviously reveals itself as limited and capable for further proliferation and hence familiar to the finite, I call it ''[[Transfinite number|Transfinitum]]'' and strongly contrast it with the absolute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uni-siegen.de/fb6/phima/lehre/phima10/quellentexte/handout-phima-teil4b.pdf&lt;br/&gt;Translated quote from German: {{quote|Es wurde das Aktual-Unendliche (A-U.) nach drei Beziehungen unterschieden: erstens, sofern es in der höchsten Vollkommenheit, im völlig unabhängigen außerweltlichen Sein, in Deo realisiert ist, wo ich es Absolut Unendliches oder kurzweg Absolutes nenne; zweitens, sofern es in der abhängigen, kreatürlichen Welt vertreten ist; drittens, sofern es als mathematische Größe, Zahl oder Ordnungstypus vom Denken in abstracto aufgefaßt werden kann. In den beiden letzten Beziehungen, wo es offenbar als beschränktes, noch weiterer Vermehrung fähiges und insofern dem Endlichen verwandtes A.-U. sich darstellt, nenne ich es ''Transfinitum'' und setze es dem Absoluten strengstens entgegen.}}[Ca-a, p. 378].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to [[Richard Dedekind]] (text in square brackets not present in original):{{refn|''Gesammelte Abhandlungen'',&lt;ref&gt;''Gesammelte Abhandlungen mathematischen und philosophischen Inhalts'', Georg Cantor, ed. Ernst Zermelo, with biography by Adolf Fraenkel; orig. pub. Berlin: Verlag von Julius Springer, 1932; reprinted Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1962, and Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1980, {{ISBN|3-540-09849-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Georg Cantor, ed. Ernst Zermelo, Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1962, pp. 443–447; translated into English in ''From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931'', ed. Jean van Heijenoort, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1967, pp. 113–117.  These references both purport to be a letter from Cantor to Dedekind, dated July 28, 1899.  However, as [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] has discovered,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digizeitschriften.de/home/services/pdfterms/?ID=516899 The Rediscovery of the Cantor-Dedekind Correspondence]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, I. Grattan-Guinness, ''Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung'' '''76''' (1974/75), pp. 104–139, at p. 126 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; this is in fact an amalgamation by Cantor's editor, [[Ernst Zermelo]], of two letters from Cantor to Dedekind, the first dated July 28 and the second dated August 3.|name=GesammelteAbhandlungen}}

{{quotation|
A [[cardinal number|multiplicity]] is called [[well-ordered]] if it fulfills the condition that every sub-multiplicity has a first [[element (mathematics)|element]]; such a multiplicity I call for short a "sequence".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I envisage the system of all [ordinal] numbers and denote it ''Ω''.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The system ''Ω'' in its natural ordering according to magnitude is a "sequence".&lt;br /&gt;
Now let us adjoin 0 as an additional element to this sequence, and place it, obviously, in the first position; then we obtain a sequence ''Ω′'':&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
0, 1, 2, 3, ... &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1, ..., &amp;gamma;, ...
&lt;br /&gt;
of which one can readily convince oneself that every number γ occurring in it is the type [i.e., order-type] of the sequence of all its preceding elements (including 0).  (The sequence ''Ω'' has this property first for ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1. [ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1 should be ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.])&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now ''Ω&amp;prime;'' (and therefore also ''Ω'') cannot be a consistent multiplicity. For if ''Ω&amp;prime;'' were consistent, then as a well-ordered set, a number ''δ'' would correspond to it which would be greater than all numbers of the system ''Ω''; the number ''δ'', however, also belongs to the system ''Ω'', because it comprises all numbers. Thus ''δ'' would be greater than ''δ'', which is a contradiction. Therefore:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''The system Ω of all [ordinal] numbers is an inconsistent, absolutely infinite multiplicity.''}}

== The Burali-Forti paradox ==
{{main|Burali-Forti paradox}}
The idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems [[paradoxical]] to many. This is related to [[Burali-Forti paradox|Cesare Burali-Forti's "paradox"]] which states that there can be no greatest [[ordinal number]]. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.

More generally, as noted by [[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|A. W. Moore]], there can be no end to the process of [[set (mathematics)|set]] formation, and thus no such thing as the ''totality of all sets'', or the ''set hierarchy''.  Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the [[cumulative hierarchy|hierarchy]] and thus failing to contain every set.

A standard solution to this problem is found in [[Zermelo set theory|Zermelo's set theory]], which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property ''and lie in some given set'' (Zermelo's [[Axiom schema of specification|Axiom of Separation]]). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.

While this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed, [[naive set theory]] might be said to be based on this notion. Although Zermelo's fix allows a [[Class (set theory)|class]] to describe arbitrary (possibly "large") entities, these predicates of the [[meta-language]] may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. For example, the class of all sets would be a [[proper class]]. This is philosophically unsatisfying to some and has motivated additional work in [[set theory]] and other methods of formalizing the foundations of mathematics such as [[New Foundations#How NF.28U.29 avoids the set-theoretic paradoxes|New Foundations]] by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Acestes''' or '''Egestes''' (Greek '''{{lang|grc|Ἄκέστης}})''' was the son of the [[Sicilia]]n river-god [[Crinisus]] by a [[Dardanus (city)|Dardanian]] or [[Troy|Trojan]] woman named Egesta or Segesta.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 195, 550, v. 36, 711, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Servius]], this woman Egesta or Segesta was sent by her father, Hippotes or Ipsostratus, to [[Sicily]], that she might not be devoured by the monsters, which infested the territory of [[Troy]], and which had been sent into the land, because the Trojans had refused to reward [[Poseidon]] and [[Apollo]] for having built the walls of their city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Schmidt  | first = Leonhard  | contribution = Acestes  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 7  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0016.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Egesta arrived in Sicily, the river-god [[Crinisus]] in the form of a bear or a dog sired with her a son named Acestes, who was afterwards regarded as the hero who had founded the town of [[Segesta]].&lt;ref&gt;Comp. Schol. ''ad Lycophron'' 951, 963.&lt;/ref&gt;

A slight variation on the tradition has it that Acestes welcomed [[Aeneas]] when he arrived in [[Sicily]]. The funeral games of Aeneas' father [[Anchises]] were held there.  Those of Aeneas' folk who wished to voyage no further were allowed to remain behind with Acestes and together with Acestes' people they founded the city of Acesta, that is [[Segesta]].

==Mythological tradition of Dionysius==
The tradition of Acestes in [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]],&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius, i. 52&lt;/ref&gt; who calls him Aegestus ({{lang|grc|Αίγεστος}}), is different, for according to him, the grandfather of Aegestus quarreled with [[Laomedon]], who slew him and gave his daughters to some merchants to convey them to a distant land.  A noble Trojan however embarked with them, and married one of them in Sicily, where she subsequently gave birth to a son, Aegestus.  During the war against Troy Aegestus obtained permission from [[Priam]] to return and take part in the contest, and afterwards returned to Sicily, where [[Aeneas]] on his arrival was hospitably received by him and [[Elymus (mythology)|Elymus]], and built for them the towns of [[Segesta|Aegesta]] and Elyme.  The account of Dionysius seems to be nothing but a rationalistic interpretation of the genuine legend.&lt;ref&gt;As to the inconsistencies in Virgil's account of Acestes, see Heyne, ''Excurs.'' 1, ''on Aen.'' v.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrow of Acestes ==
In the [[Aeneid]], Acestes participates in a trial of skill in which he shoots his [[arrow]] which then bursts into flame as a sign from Jupiter of Acestes' deserved honor.

'''Alexandros Pepekas Papadiamantis''' ({{lang-el|Ἀλέξανδρος Παπαδιαμάντης}}; 4 March 1851 – 3 January 1911), also spelled '''Alexandros Papadiamandis''', was an influential [[Greece|Greek]] novelist, short-story writer and poet.

==Biography==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
Papadiamantis was born in Greece, on the island of [[Skiathos]], in the western part of the [[Aegean Sea]]. The island would figure prominently in his work. His father was a priest.  He moved to [[Athens]] as a young man to complete his high school studies, and enrolled at the School of Philosophy of the [[University of Athens]], but never completed his studies.This happened because he had economic difficulties, and had to find a job to make a living.

He returned to his native island in later life, and died there.  He supported himself by writing throughout his adult life, anything from journalism and short stories to several serialized novels.  From a certain point onwards he had become very popular, and newspapers and magazines vied for his writings, offering him substantial fees.  Papadiamantis did not care for money, and would often ask for lower fees if he thought they were unfairly high; furthermore he spent his money carelessly and took no care of his clothing and appearance.  He never married, and was known to be a recluse, whose only true cares were observing and writing about the life of the poor, and chanting at church: he was referred to as "kosmokalogeros" (κοσμοκαλόγερος, "a monk in the world"). He died of [[pneumonia]].

==Works==
Papadiamantis' longest works were the serialized novels ''The Gypsy Girl'', ''The Emigrant'', and ''The Merchants of Nations''. These were adventures set around the Mediterranean, with rich plots involving captivity, war, pirates, the plague, etc. However, the author is best remembered for his scores of short stories. Written in his own version of the then official language of Greece, "[[katharevousa]]" (a "purist" written language heavily influenced by ancient Greek), Papadiamantis' stories are little gems. They provide lucid and lyrical portraits of country life in Skiathos, or urban life in the poorer neighborhoods of Athens, with frequent flashes of deep psychological insight. The nostalgia for a lost island childhood is palpable in most of them; the stories with an urban setting often deal with [[social alienation|alienation]]. Characters are sketched with a deft hand, and they speak in the authentic "demotic" spoken language of the people; island characters lapse into dialect. Papadiamantis' deep Christian faith, complete with the mystical feeling associated with the Orthodox Christian liturgy, suffuses many stories. Most of his work is tinged with melancholy, and resonates with empathy with people's suffering, regardless of whether they are saints or sinners, innocent or conflicted. His only saint, in fact, is a poor shepherd who, having warned the islanders, is slaughtered by Saracen pirates after he refuses to abandon his flock for the safety of the fortified town.  This particular story, ''The Poor Saint'', is the closest he comes to a truly religious theme.

An example of Papadiamantis' deep and even-handed feeling for humanity is his acknowledged masterpiece, the novella ''The Murderess''.  It is the story of an old woman in Skiathos, who pities families with many daughters: given their low socioeconomic status, girls could not work before marriage and they could not marry unless they provide a dowry; therefore, they were a burden and a plight to their families. After killing her own newborn granddaughter, gravelly ill with pertussis, she crosses the line from pity to what she believes is useful and appropriate action, the "mercy killing" of young girls. She kills three young girls in succession by throwing them into wells and then pretending to be trying to save them in order to justify her presence there. As coincidences keep piling up, she is confronted with a stark fact: her assumption that she was helping was monstrously wrong, and she gradually slips into mad torment. She flees arrest and tries to hide in the wilderness, but drowns in the sea while trying to escape two policemen on her trail; as Papadiamantis puts it, she meets "death half-way between divine and human justice". The character of the murderess is depicted with deep empathy and without condemnation. "As a child, she served her parents. Once married, she was her husband's slave... when she had children, she served them, and when they had children, she became their slave". Even her name tells the story of women in 19th century rural Greece: her birth name, Hadoula, "tenderling", is all but forgotten; she now is the "''Fragkoyannoú''", i.e. the widow of Yannis Fragkos, her whole existence referenced only to the name of her late, good-for-nothing husband.

His work is seminal in Modern Greek literature: he is for Greek prose what [[Dionysios Solomos]] is for poetry. As [[Odysseas Elytis]] wrote: "commemorate Dionysios Solomos, commemorate Alexander Papadiamantis". It is a body of work, however, that is virtually impossible to translate, as the magic of his language is founded on the Greek [[diglossia]]: elaborately crafted, high Katharevousa for the narrative, interspersed with authentic local dialect for the dialogue, and with all dialectical elements used in the narrative formulated in strict Katharevousa, and therefore in forms that had never actually existed.

{{For|the book by Robert Rankin|The Antipope}}
An '''antipope''' ({{lang-la|antipapa}}) is a person who, in opposition to the one who is generally seen as the legitimately elected [[Pope]], makes a significantly accepted competing claim to be the Pope,&lt;ref&gt;"One who opposes the legitimately elected bishop of Rome, endeavours to secure the papal throne, and to some degree succeeds materially in the attempt" ([http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/28501/antipope Encyclopædia Britannica: ''Antipope'']).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Diocese of Rome|Bishop of Rome]] and leader of the [[Catholic Church]]. At times between the 3rd and mid-15th centuries, antipopes were supported by a fairly significant faction of religious [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and secular or anti-religious [[monarch]]s and kingdoms. Persons who claim to be pope, but have few followers, such as the modern [[Sedevacantism|sedevacantist]] antipopes, are not classified with the historical antipopes.

==History==
[[Hippolytus of Rome]] (d.&amp;nbsp;235) is commonly considered to be the earliest antipope, as he headed a separate group within the Church in Rome against [[Pope Callixtus I]]. Hippolytus was reconciled to Callixtus's second successor, [[Pope Pontian]], and both he and Pontian are honoured as saints by the Catholic Church with a shared [[feast day]] on 13 August. Whether two or more persons have been confused in this account of Hippolytus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/jubilee_2000/magazine/documents/ju_mag_01091997_p-70_en.html|title= The catacombs the destination of the great jubilee|publisher=[[Vatican City]]|accessdate=3 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070910175629/http://www.vatican.va/jubilee_2000/magazine/documents/ju_mag_01091997_p-70_en.html| archivedate= 10 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether Hippolytus actually declared himself to be the Bishop of Rome, remains unclear, since no such claim by Hippolytus has been cited in the writings attributed to him.

[[Eusebius]] quotes&lt;ref&gt;''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', V, 28&lt;/ref&gt; from an unnamed earlier writer the story of Natalius, a [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd-century]] priest who accepted the bishopric of the [[Adoptionism|Adoptionists]],&lt;ref name=Dix&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dix|first1=Gregory|last2=Chadwick|first2=Henry|title=The Treatise on the Apostolic Tradition of St Hippolytus of Rome, Bishop and Martyr|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136101465|page=xvii|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=l8syjXASpNwC&amp;pg=PR27|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a heretical group in Rome. Natalius soon repented and tearfully begged [[Pope Zephyrinus]] to receive him into communion.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century/Dictionary/Z/Zephyrinus|Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature: Zephyrinus]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10448a.htm|title=Monarchians – Dynamists, or Adoptionists|publisher=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=3 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930012741/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10448a.htm| archivedate= 30 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Novatian]] (d. 258), another third-century figure, certainly claimed the See of Rome in opposition to [[Pope Cornelius]], and if Natalius and Hippolytus were excluded because of the uncertainties concerning them, Novatian could then be said to be the first antipope.

The period in which antipopes were most numerous was during the struggles between the popes and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s of the 11th and 12th centuries. The emperors frequently imposed their own nominees to further their own causes. The popes, likewise, sometimes sponsored rival imperial claimants ([[anti-king]]s) in Germany to overcome a particular emperor.

The [[Western Schism]]—which began in 1378, when the French cardinals, claiming that the election of [[Pope Urban VI]] was invalid, elected antipope [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] as a rival to the Roman Pope—led eventually to two competing lines of antipopes: the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon line]] (Clement VII took up residence in [[Avignon]], France), and the [[Council of Pisa|Pisan]] line. The Pisan line, which began in 1409, was named after the town of Pisa, Italy, where the (Pisan) council had elected antipope [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] as a third claimant. To end the schism, in May 1415, the [[Council of Constance]] deposed antipope [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] of the Pisan line. [[Pope Gregory XII]] of the Roman line resigned in July 1415. In 1417, the Council also formally deposed antipope [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] of Avignon, but he refused to resign. Afterwards, [[Pope Martin V]] was elected and was accepted everywhere except in the small and rapidly diminishing area that remained faithful to Benedict XIII. The scandal of the Western Schism created anti-papal sentiment and fed into the [[Protestant Reformation]] at the turn of the 16th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== List of historical antipopes ==

The following table gives the names of the antipopes included in the list of popes and antipopes in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', with the addition of the names of Natalius (in spite of doubts about his historicity) and [[Antipope Clement VIII]] (whose following was insignificant).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09725a.htm Michael Ott, "Pope Martin V" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1910)]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An asterisk marks those who were included in the conventional numbering of later Popes who took the same name. More commonly, the antipope is ignored in later papal regnal numbers; for example, there was an [[Antipope John XXIII]], but the new Pope John elected in 1958 was also called [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]]. For the additional confusion regarding Popes named John, see [[Pope John (numbering)]].

The list of popes and antipopes in the ''Annuario Pontificio'' attaches the following note to the name of [[Pope Leo VIII]] (963–965):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At this point, as again in the mid-11th century, we come across [[Papal conclave|elections]] in which problems of harmonising historical criteria and those of [[theology]] and [[canon law]] make it impossible to decide clearly which side possessed the legitimacy whose factual existence guarantees the unbroken lawful succession of the successors of [[Saint Peter]]. The uncertainty that in some cases results has made it advisable to abandon the assignation of successive numbers in the list of the popes.&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontificio 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2008 {{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), p.&amp;nbsp;12*&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, because of the obscurities about mid-11th-century canon law and the historical facts, the ''Annuario Pontificio'' lists [[Pope Sylvester III|Sylvester III]] as a pope, without thereby expressing a judgement on his legitimacy. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' places him in its ''List of Popes'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12272b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: List of Popes|publisher=|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with the annotation: "Considered by some to be an antipope". Other sources classify him as an antipope.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles William Previté-Orton]] ''The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History'' (Cambridge University Press 1952, republished 1975 {{ISBN|0-521-20962-5}}), vol. 1, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=+Darras+%22title+of+sylvester+iii%22&amp;btnG= Joseph Épiphane Darras, ''A General History of the Catholic Church'', vol. III, p. 58]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern claimants to papacy ==
{{details|Conclavism}}

In modern times various people claim to be pope and, though they do not fit the technical definition of "antipope", are sometimes referred to as such. They are usually leaders of [[sedevacantism|sedevacantist]] groups who view the See of Rome as vacant and elect someone to fill it. They are sometimes referred to as [[conclavism|conclavists]] because of their claim, on the basis of an election by a "conclave" of perhaps half a dozen laypeople, as in the case of [[David Bawden]] ("Pope Michael I"), to have rendered the See no longer vacant. A significant number of these have taken the name "[[Pope Peter II|Peter II]]", owing to its special significance. From the point of view of the [[Catholic Church]], they are [[schism]]atics, and as such are [[Latae sententiae|automatically excommunicated]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P52.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1364]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Ginés Jesús Hernández]] (Pope Gregory XVIII) (2011–2016)
* [[Joseph Odermatt]] (Pope Peter III) (2016–present)

The Palmarian Catholic Church regards [[Pope Paul VI]], whom they revere as a martyr, and his predecessors as true popes, but hold, on the grounds of claimed apparitions, that the Pope of Rome is excommunicated and that the position of the [[Holy See]] has, since 1978, been transferred to the See of [[El Palmar de Troya]].

== Antipope of Alexandria ==
As the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], has historically also held the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria#Episcopal title|title of Pope]], a person who, in opposition to someone who is generally accepted as a legitimate [[Pope of Alexandria]], claims to hold that position may also be considered an Antipope. In 2006, the defrocked [[marriage|married]] [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[lector]] Max Michel became an Antipope of Alexandria, calling himself Maximos I. His claim to the Alexandrine Papacy was dismissed by both the [[Coptic Orthodox]] [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Pope Shenouda III]] and [[Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria|Pope Theodore II]] of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa|Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copticpope.org/downloads/commondec/commondec-2-2006eng.pdf|title=Common Statement Between The Coptic Orthodox Church And The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa Regarding Max Michel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511170645/http://www.copticpope.org/downloads/commondec/commondec-2-2006eng.pdf|archive-date=2008-05-11|access-date=3 October 2016|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coptic Pope of Alexandria and the Greek Pope of Alexandria currently view one another, not as Antipopes, but rather as successors to differing lines of [[apostolic succession]] that formed as a result of [[christology|christological]] disputes in the fifth century.

Another Coptic (Alexandrian) Antipope is known to have laid claim in the fourth century. His name was [[Gregory of Cappadocia]].

== Fiction ==
Antipopes have appeared as fictional characters. These may be either in [[historical fiction]], as fictional portraits of well-known historical antipopes or as purely imaginary antipopes.

* [[Dan Simmons]]'s novels ''[[Endymion (Simmons novel)|Endymion]]'' and ''[[The Rise of Endymion]]'' feature a Father Paul Duré who is the routinely murdered antipope Teilhard I.

* In the ''[[Girl Genius]]'' comics series, set in a [[gaslamp fantasy]] version of Europe thrown into chaos by mad science (among other things), there is a brief reference to the existence of seven Popes—all of whom apparently ordered a particular text [[Book burning|burned]].
* [[Ralph McInerny]]'s novel ''The Red Hat'' features a schism between liberals and conservatives following the election of a conservative African Pope; the liberal faction elect an Italian cardinal who calls himself "Pius XIII".
* In the video game ''[[Crusader Kings II]]'' by Swedish developer [[Paradox Interactive]], Catholic rulers may appoint one of their bishops as an antipope. An emperor-tier ruler such as the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] may declare war on the [[Papal States]] to install their antipope as the "true" pope, thereby [[vassal]]izing the Papacy.
* In episode 3 of ''[[The Black Adder]]'' (set in the late 15th century), "[[The Archbishop]]", [[Baldrick]] remarks on selling counterfeit papal pardons, that one for the highest crimes requires the signatures of "both popes" (implying one pope and one antipope).

[[Image:Golden Aum.png|thumb|right|145px|[[Om|OM]], a sacred syllable and a quintessential symbol of Hinduism. Its meanings are many.]]
[[File:Thamarai Iconic.png|thumb|145px| The sacred symbol of Ayyavazhi, [[The Symbol of Ayyavazhi|The Lotus with Soul]]]]

'''Ayyavazhi and Hinduism''' are two belief systems in [[India]]. Although [[Ayyavazhi]] continues to officially exist within [[Hinduism]] and is considered by some observers to be a [[Hindu denomination]], members of the religion claim that it is independent. The most notable distinction between Hinduism and Ayyavazhi is their different approaches to the concepts of good, evil and [[dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayyavazhi Religion|url=http://www.religious-information.com/ayyavazhi-religion.html|work=religious-information.com|publisher=SBI|accessdate=29 March 2012|format=Web page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus view [[Vedas]], [[Gita]], and other texts from the [[Shastra]] as canonical scriptures, instead of the [[Akilam]]. The Ayyavazhi believe that the Hindu scriptures were once canonical, but now have lost their Substance because of the advent of Akilam. [[Kaliyan]] bought the Vedas as a Boon and so all the previous religious books including [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] and [[Puranas]] lost their Substances, leaving Akilattirattu Ammanai as the only book of perfection. Several dubious claims state that the present day Vedas are not accepted by Ayyavazhi as books of Perfection, because there is a quote in Akilam about [[Venneesan]] ''"Avan pilathaal  vedamondruntakki"'' (He created a Veda of his own intention). All previous religious texts have lost their Substance in the vision of Ayyavazhi at the very moment Kaliyan came to the world.

Though Ayyavazhi has many differences from popular Hinduism, it has many beliefs and practices in common. As Hinduism is really a tree of many branches, Ayyavazhi is closest to [[Smartism]] and its [[Advaita]] beliefs in thought.

== Differences specific to Ayyavazhi ==

=== Religious Practices ===
The religious practises of Ayyavazhi largely differ from traditional Hinduism. Akilam says that previous practices were not wrong, but that they were distorted because of the abnormal, cruel nature of [[Kaliyan]] and his boons, which the Universe had experienced before. [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] says that the whole acts and rules of the Universe had changed by the advent of Kaliyan. [[Thiru Nadana Ula]], a part of [[Akilam eight]] discusses this change in detail.

==== Wearing of Thirunamam ====
{{See also|Symbol of Ayyavazhi}}

The Ayyavazhi people use a unique religious mark. The vertical white mark is worn on the forehead in the shape of a flame, starting from the central point between the eyebrows, and rising to the top edge of the forehead. The flame shape represents [[Aanma Jyothi]] or [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]. Zealous devotees smear it on the exterior of the upper arms and over the chest. This white mark is unlike the one worn by a [[Hindu]] of [[Vaishnavist]] tradition, worn on the forehead in the shape of a 'U', or of [[Saivist]] tradition who wear it horizontally as three parallel lines. The white powder used for this mark was made from coarse white soil, found at lower layer of the earth, while ash is used in [[Hinduism]].

At present, those who 'serve' in [[Pathi]]s or [[Nizhal Thangals]] wear this white mark for the people and give a portion of it to their hands. People carry it home as a holy object, and some of them even swallow a little of it believing it to be medicinal.

==== Wearing of Headgear ====
One of the significant ritual actions that distinguishes [[Ayyavazhi]] male worshipper from others is 'wearing headgear' during worship. [[Ayya Vaikundar]] seems to have enjoined his male followers to tie on headgear when they came to worship God, considering it as a crown. Accordingly, the male followers tied on headgear during worship. This is to reveal that every person is a king and every one is to rule the Earth. This philosophy is told symbolically by the practice of wearing the headgear. It was a counteraction to the practice of tying a cloth around the waist, which symbolizes bondage.

It became a ritual action to be performed before entering the [[Pathi]] to worship. Male devotees usually removed their upper garment and tied the headgear before entering the Pathi. To this day this practice is followed.

==== Worship in Front of Mirror ====
The [[Nizhal Thangals]] and [[Pathis]] have, in their sanctuary, a [[mirror]] to reflect the images worshippers. People pay obeisance to their God standing in front of this mirror, facing the [[Elunetru]] amidst two oil lamps. Even in the houses of the people of Ayyavazhi, the place earmarked for their daily worship has at least a mirror and a lamp. The mirror's  placement symbolizes that God is inside oneself and it is of no use to seek God elsewhere. This practice is different from the placement of [[murti]], or icon in Hindu Temples, in that this is a non-[[anthropomorphic]] form of worship. In different denominations of Hinduism, [[Saivites]] venerate the [[linga]] and [[Vaishnavites]] venerate the [[saligrama]] in a non-anthropomorphic form of worship.

====A New mode of Worship====
The Ayyavazhi mode of worship was new in that milieu. It distinguished itself from the [[Sanskrit]] religion and [[folk religion]]s. Instructions for abandoning temple worship, temple offerings, priestly functions, blood sacrifices and image worship abound in [[Akilam]]. Unlike some practices in [[Hinduism]], it says, "Do not institute Temples, Do not offer puja, blood sacrifices, do not kill animals, do not worship images made of Clay" etc.

==== A Distinct Language ====
The [[Tamil language]] is considered sacred, rather than [[Sanskrit]], as is holy within mainstream Hinduism. In Akilam there is a quote that Tamil will be the language in [[Dharma Yukam]]. Also unlike other Hindu scriptures in Tamil, Akilattirattu and [[Arul Nool]] were written using a simple form of language. Extracts from ancient Hindu scriptures are found in it, translated simply, so that common people could understand.

=== Beliefs ===
A few beliefs of Ayyavazhi are different from Hinduism.

==== Vaikunda Avatar ====
Ayyavazhi believes Vaikundar is the incarnation of [[Narayana]] in this [[Kali Yukam]], sent to destroy the evils of [[Kali yuga]]. Hindus accept [[Kalki]] rather than Vaikundar as the Incarnation who will be sent to destroy such evil. Also, Hindus believe that the spirit of Kali yuga has yet to be destroyed, but Ayyavazhi says that the spirit of Kali Yuga started its decline immediately after the Avatar of Vaikundar arrived. This was due to the torture of a [[Pantaram]] (Vaikundar), who was tortured because he had promised to [[Thirumal]] that he would not harm any Pantaram.

====Eight Yukams====
Regarding [[yuga|Yukam]]s, Ayyavazhi believes in a system of [[Eight Yukams]] while Hinduism suggests a system of four Yugas (Yukams).

==== Kroni ====
Ayyavazhi believes in a primordial manifestation of evil [[Kroni]] similar to [[Satan]] in [[Abrahamic Religions]], while Hinduism has no personification of [[Evil]].

==== Trimurthi ====
The view on Trimurti (three aspects of Brahman) is similar to [[Smartism]], which like Ayya Vazhi, recognizes that [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva|Siva]] are different aspects of the same [[God]]. By contrast, for example, in [[Saivism]], [[Sivan]] (the Tamil name for Siva) is considered superior while in [[Vaishnavism]] [[Vishnu]] is considered superior. In Ayyavazhi the three were considered equal in all the previous six Yukams. But only in [[Kali Yukam]] are all the powers surrendered to [[Narayana]] by [[Sivan]] and [[Vethan|Nathan]] because Kaliyan was created by them without discussion with Narayana. Regarding [[Vaikunda Avatharam]], [[Ayya Vaikundar]] is superior to the three because the [[Moolamoorthy]] or [[Paramathma]], superior to Trimuthi is that who incarnates as Vaikundar, but in Hinduism Vishnu incarnates. However Vishnu was the first to form in this Universe within the three according to [[Akilam]].

==== Dharma Yukam ====
Ayyavazhi believes in a [[Dharma Yukam]] where Vaikundar rules the world with the [[Santror Makkal]]. In Hinduism they believe in [[Satya Yuga]] which does not mention Vaikundar.

==== Unifying the Deities ====
In Ayyavazhi, Vaikundar performed symbolic marriages by which he unified all the powers of the universe into himself and so all were seen as one, which is similar to the beliefs of [[Smartism]]. But in other branches of Hinduism, they acknowledge different powers as superior and may worship different powers in different forms.

=== Sociology ===

==== Congregational Worship ====
Amongst the Ayyavazhi, congregational worship is practiced, while in Hinduism the Priest chants the [[mantra]]s and performs rituals, and the devotees watch. But in Ayyavazhi the [[Panivediyalar]] chants the [[mantra]]s and the others repeat it.

==== Thottu Namam ====
In Ayyavazhi [[Thottu Namam]] means "wearing [[Thirunamam]] with a personal touch", which means the Panivedaiyalar will bestow the Thirunamam by touching the forehead of the devotees. But in Hinduism the Priests gives the [[Prachatham]] by throwing, in the belief that if he happened to touch the worshipers body it would make him [[ritually unclean]]. In olden days this was practiced because the [[Brahmins]] kept a distance from the other [[caste]]s. This "Thottu Namam" was an intentional counteraction of this ancient Hindu tradition, put forward by Ayyavazhi.

==== Ayyavazhi Marriage ====
Unlike the traditional Hindu way of marriage, Ayyavazhi does not have many ritual practices. But it also differs in marriage as a whole. In Ayyavazhi the couple was seated facing the geographic [[south]] witnessing the [[Thuvaraiyam Pathi]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]. In addition to the priest, all the people who witness the marriage chant the mantras, and praise the couple following the priest, while in Hinduism this was done only by the Priest.

==== Funeral practice ====
In [[Ayyavazhi]], unlike in [[Hinduism]], the body of the dead is [[burial|buried]]. Generally, Hinduism mandates [[cremation]] and limits burial to monks and children under five.

The body is buried in a position that faces the geographic north in a [[Lotus position|Padmasana]] position. No boxes such as [[coffin]]s are used. The body is placed inside and covered by [[sand]] or [[Thirunamam|Namam]] (sacred soil). This practice is done with the belief that the deceased is performing [[austerity]] for the unfolding of [[Dharma Yukam]]. There was also a belief that the body of a person who was free from birth will not decay, and will be preserved as it is. Then as the Dharma Yukam unfolds, Vaikundar will blow a [[Conch]] shell and these people will rise from the grave. This scenario resembles the [[Last Judgment]] in the Abrahamic religions.

The practice of burial is strikingly similar to funeral practices, in [[Lingayatism]], a reform movement in [[Karnataka]], like Ayyavazhi, which was critical of the caste system. Unlike Ayyavazhi, Lingyatism focuses on Shiva as the supreme God.

==Similarities between Ayyavazhi and Hinduism==

=== Religious Practices ===

==== Dress during worship ====
Like Hinduism the male worshippers of Ayyavazhi do not wear any upper garments during worship. Footwear is prohibited in worship centers. Also in Ayyavazhi, the female worshippers do not go to worship centers during the period of [[Menses]], like other Hindus.

==== Circumambulation ====
The practice of circumambulation is quite commonly seen in Ayyavazhi as in Hinduism. In Ayyavazhi the devotees use to take a bath and circumambulate the outer Pathi and then the inner Pathi and then the [[sanctum sanatorium]].

==== Saffron ====
[[Saffron]] is considered as sacred in Ayyavazhi as in its father religion, Hinduism. All the Panividaiyalars (those who perform Panividai) in [[Pathi]]s and [[Nizhal Thangals]] dress in a saffron [[dothi]] and saffron headgear which are collectively known as [[Kavi Vasthiram]]. This is also the colour of the flag that is to be hoisted in Pathis, as told as [[Chandiravarnam]], and is the colour of the Ayyavazhi flags hoisted over their temples.

==== Rudraksha ====
Like Hinduism, and particularly [[Saivism]] Ayyavazhi consider [[Rudraksha]] to be sacred.

==== Theertham ====
Like Hinduism, Ayyavazhi stress [[Theertham]]. But according to Ayyavazhi, [[Muttirikkinaru]] and [[Muttappathi]] were considered most sacred.

=== Theology ===

==== Ultimate Oneness ====
Ayyavazhi like the [[Advaita]] tradition within Hinduism accepts the Ultimate Oneness, which is akin to the concept of [[Brahman]]. It says that the universe formed from the [[Ekam]]. [[Thiruvasakam - 2]] describes the formation of this present Universe. Like Advaita, it believes that Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva are different aspects of the same God.

==== Incarnation ====
Just as Mahaprabhu [[Caitanya]] was thought of as an incarnation of Vishnu (and more specifically of Krishna) in [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] so too is Ayya [[Vaikundar]] thought to be an incarnation of Vishnu. It is believed that God incarnates Himself to educate his children on obtaining union with Him.

==== Reincarnation ====
Ayyavazhi, like Hinduism, believes in [[reincarnation]]. It states that all lives are continually reborn until they reach Dharma Yukam, the state of [[Moksha]].

==== Karma ====
Ayyavazhi disciples believe in the law of karma and that practicing good karma will grant them Moksha. The practice of good karma leads the devotee to God.

==== Moksha ====
Moksha is the goal of Ayyavazhi. The Ayyavazhi disciple believes like other Hindus that this too is a union with God in which the soul achieves perfect [[Inner peace|Shanti]] ("peace") and [[Swarga]] ("heaven.")

==== Ahimsa ====
[[Ahimsa]] is [[Sanskrit]] for "non-violence" and the Ayyavazhi accept this principle.

==== Vegetarianism ====
The Ayyavazhi believe in the vegetarian principle, which is an important aspect of Ahimsa. Ayya Vaikundar is considered an incarnation of Vishnu and in [[Vaishnavism]], meat-eating is forbidden.

==== Chanting of the Lord's name ====
This principle (known in Sanskrit as Sankirtana Yajna) is an essential sacrifice especially for this age. It is believed that chanting the name of the Lord is an auspicious way to worship.

==== God is inside everybody ====
In Hinduism it is believed that the spirit of God is present within the heart of every human. The Ayyavazhi too believe that God is present within humans.

==== Final Judgement ====
In the Ayyavazhi tradition, it is believed that in the final judgement, the demon will be sentenced to hell while Vaikundar and Santror will rule the world. In Hinduism also it is believed that God Vishnu will incarnate Himself to destroy this age of hypocrisy.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}

==== Sanskrit ====
Although the Ayyvazhi prefer local language rather than Sanskrit, devotees name their children in Sanskrit (e.g. Vaikunar, Krishna, Narayan.)

[[File:The Drowning of Britomartis, 1547–59.jpg|thumb|''The Drowning of Britomartis'', probably design by [[Jean Cousin the Elder]], tapestry.]]
'''Britomartis''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Βριτόμαρτις}}) was a Greek goddess of mountains and hunting, who was primarily worshipped on the island of [[Crete]]. She was sometimes believed to be an [[oread]], or a mountain [[nymph]], but she was often conflated or syncretized with [[Artemis]] and [[Aphaea]], the "invisible" patroness of [[Aegina]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Pilafidis-Williams, ''The Sanctuary of Aphaia on Aigina in the Bronze Age'' (Munich: Hirmer) 1998, describes the distinctive local cult but is cautious in retrojecting the later cult of Aphaia to describe Britomartis at Aigina; the explicit identification of Britomartis and Aphaea is in [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ii.30.3 and in [[Diodorus Siculus]], v.76.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also known as ''Diktynna'' (Δίκτυννα; derived by Hellenistic writers as from δίκτυα [''diktya''], "hunting nets").&lt;ref&gt;For example, "...all but caught, she leapt into the sea from the top of a cliff and fell into the nets of fishermen which saved her. Whence in after days the Kydonians call the Nymphe Diktyna (Lady of the Nets) and the hill whence the Nymphe leaped they call the hill of Nets (Diktaion)," ([[Callimachus]], ''Ode 3 to Artemis'', 188ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
According to [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]], the name 'Britomartis' is from a Cretan dialect; he also says that her name means ''virgo dulcis'', or "sweet virgin".&lt;ref&gt;[[Solinus]], ix.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Solinus also identifies her explicitly as the Cretan Artemis.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by [[H. J. Rose]], ''A Handbook of Greek Mythology'' (New York) 1959:117, citing [[Theodor Mommsen]]'s edition, 1864.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] also equates the Cretan word βριτύ (''brite'') with Greek γλυκύ (''glyke'') 'sweet'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paleoglot.blogspot.ca/2009/12/deeper-source-of-cretan-britomartis.html "A deeper source of Cretan Britomartis"] paleoglot.blogspot.ca&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have argued that ''Britomartis'' ("sweet maid") is an [[epithet]] that does not reveal the goddess's name,&lt;ref&gt;A Christian parallel may render this observation even clearer: ''Mater dolens'', "grieving mother", identifies the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Blessed Virgin]], but none of the four attributes—"grieving, mother, blessed, virgin"— gives her name, ''[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; nor her character, instead arguing that it may be an [[apotropaic]] [[euphemism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Her name is supposed to mean the 'Good Maiden' — which like [[Aristaios]] and [[Callisto (mythology)|Kalliste]], may be a euphemism for its opposite, the Maiden of Death." ([[Carl A.P. Ruck]] and [[Danny Staples]], ''The World of Classical Myth'' [Carolina Academic Press], 1994:113).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
The goddess was frequently portrayed on Cretan coinage, either as herself or as [[Diktynna]], the goddess of Mount Dikte, Zeus' birthplace. As Diktynna, she was depicted as a winged goddess with a human face, standing atop her ancient mountain, grasping an animal in each hand, in the guise of ''[[Potnia Theron]]'',  the mistress of animals.

By Hellenistic and Roman times, Britomartis was given a genealogical setting that fitted her into a Classical context:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Britomartis, who is also called Diktynna, the myths relate, was born at Kaino in Crete of Zeus and [[Carme (mythology)|Karme]],&lt;ref&gt;who was a grain-harvest sprite.&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of [[Eubuleus|Euboulos]] who was the son of [[Demeter]]; she invented the nets [''diktya''] which are used in hunting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], 5.76.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The third hymn to Artemis by [[Callimachus]] tells how she was pursued by [[Minos]] and, as '''Diktynna''', "Lady of the Nets", threw herself into fishermen's nets to escape him; thus rescued, she was taken by the fishermen to mainland Greece. She was also known as '''Dicte'''.  This myth element "explains" the spread of the Cretan goddess's cult to Greece. Didorus Siculus found it less than credible:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But those men who tell the tale that she has been named Diktynna because she fled into some fishermen’s nets when she was pursued by Minos, who would have ravished her, have missed the truth; for it is not a probable story that the goddess should ever have got into so helpless a state that she would have required the aid that men can give, being as she is the daughter of the greatest one of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus 5.76.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Strabo]] notes she was venerated as Diktynna only in western Crete, in the region of [[Cydonia (ancient Greece)|Cydonia]], where there was a ''Diktynnaion'', or temple of Diktynna.  "Oupis [Artemis], O queen, fairfaced Bringer of Light, thee too the Kretans name after that Nymph," Callimachus says.  "She passed her time in the company of Artemis, this being the reason why some men think Diktynna and Artemis are one and the same goddess," [[Diodorus Siculus]] (5.76.3) suggested.  &lt;!--"Britomartis was patron of mountains, shores, nets and ports."-is this any more than a modern extrapolation of the myth elements?--&gt;

In the second century CE, the Greek writer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] describes Britomartis saying, "She was made a goddess by Artemis, and she is worshipped, not only by the Cretans, but also by the [[Aegina|Aiginetans]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pausanias, ''The Guide to Greece'' 2.30.3&lt;/ref&gt;

== As Diktynna ==
A ''[[xoanon]]'', a wooden cult statue, of Britomartis, allegedly carved by [[Daedalus]], sat in the temple of [[Olous]]. In [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]] and Olous, she was often portrayed on coins, showing that she was worshipped in those cities; the festival [[Britomarpeia]] was held in her honor.  As Diktynna, her face was pictured on [[Crete|Cretan]] coins of [[Kydonia]], [[Polyrrhenia]] and [[Phalasarna]] as the nurse of Zeus.  On Crete, she was connected with the mountain where Zeus was said to have been born—[[Mount Dikte]].  On some early Britomartis coins of Kydonia, the coin was manufactured as an [[overstrike]] of specimens manufactured by [[Aegina]].&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;[http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10881/cydonia.html#fieldnotes C. Michael Hogan, ''Cydonia'', The Modern Antiquarian, Jan. 23, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
Temples dedicated to her existed in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]], [[Sparta]], [[Marseille|Massalia]] and between Ambrosus and [[Anticyra]] in Phocis,&lt;ref&gt;''RE'', s.v. "Diktynna", col. 584-588.&lt;/ref&gt; where, as Artemis Diktynna, her cult object was a black stone worked by [[Aegina|Aeginetans]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (.36) saw on the high ground between the two cities "a temple of Dictynnaean Artemis, who is held in the highest honour by the people of Ambrosus; her statue is of Aeginetan workmanship in black stone."&lt;/ref&gt; but she was primarily a goddess of local importance in Western Crete, such as [[Lysos]] and West of [[Kydonia]].  Her temples were said to be guarded by vicious dogs stronger than bears.&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus, ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'', 8. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; A temple dedicated to the goddess was erected in ancient times on [[Mount Tityros]] near Cydonia.&lt;ref name="Hogan"/&gt; Another name, Pipituna, found on [[Linear B]] may be another form of Diktynna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.widdershins.org/vol11iss5/01.htm| title=The Minoan Deities Named: An Archaeologist Gleans Goddesses and Gods from Linear A| accessdate=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As Aphaea ==
Britomartis was worshipped as Aphaea primarily on the island of [[Aegina]], where the temple "Athena Aphaea" stood.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A temple dedicated to her also existed at the [[Aspropyrgos]] on the outskirts of Athens.

== Spenser's "Britomart" ==
Britomart figures in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s knightly [[Epic poetry|epic]] ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', where she is an allegorical figure of the virgin Knight of [[Chastity]], representing [[England|English]] virtue—in particular, English military power—through a folk [[etymology]] that associated ''Brit-,'' as in ''[[British people|Briton]]'', with ''Martis'', here thought of as "of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]", the Roman war god. In Spenser's allegory, Britomart connotes the Virgin Queen, [[Elizabeth I of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Needs reference.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his retelling of the [[King Arthur]] legends, ''[[Arthur Rex]]'', author [[Thomas Berger (novelist)|Thomas Berger]] suggests that Queen [[Guinevere]] may have become a powerful female knight known as Britomart after the death of the King.&lt;ref&gt;[Needs reference.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chuang Yen Monastery''' ({{zh|t=莊嚴寺|p=Zhuāngyán sì}}) is a Buddhist temple situated on 225 acres in [[Kent, New York|Kent]], [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in the United States. The temple is home to the largest indoor statue of a Buddha ([[Vairocana]]) in the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=LargestBuddha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/23174|title=Largest Indoor Buddha in the Western Hemisphere|publisher=RoadsideAmerica.com|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Chuang Yen" means "Majestically Adorned".

==History==
In November 1975, the '''Buddhist Association of the United States''' (BAUS) leased 125 acres of land in Putnam County from Dr. C.T. Shen (one of the co-founders of BAUS and late Vice President of BAUS) for the development of Chuang Yen Monastery. According to the temple, the lease was for ninety-nine years with an annual payment of one dollar. As suggested by the local government, Dr. Shen donated the land to BAUS in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing Chuang Yen Monastery|url=http://www.baus.org/en/?cat=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the temple buildings are built in the architectural style of China’s [[Tang Dynasty]], and was designed by architect Edward A Valeri RA. On May 23, 1981, a groundbreaking ceremony was held for the first building, the Kuan Yin Hall. The other buildings that make up the monastery were added over the years: the Dining Hall, the Thousand Lotus Memorial Terrace, the Tai Hsu Hall, the Yin Kuang Hall, the [[Woo Ju Memorial Library]] and the Great Buddha Hall. The Great Buddha Hall's opening was presided over by the [[14th Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Compassion of Guanyin in Carmel, New York|url=https://www.buddhistdoor.net/features/the-compassion-of-guanyin-in-carmel-new-york}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
The first President of BAUS, Venerable Lok To, laid the foundation of BAUS. Venerables Ming Chi and Xian Ming, together with Dr. Shen, took on the challenge and assumed the responsibility of building and serving Chuang Yen Monastery.

* Jen Chun (President of BAUS 1980 – 1986 &amp; 2002 – 2007)
* [[Sheng-yen]] (Abbot of Great Enlightenment Temple 1977 – 1978)
* Shou Yu (Abbot of CYM 1999 – 2001)
* Ming Kuang (Abbot of CYM 1992 – 1999, President of BAUS 1999 – 2002),
* Ji Ru (Abbot of CYM 2002 – 2004)
* Jing Tong (Abbot of CYM 2004 – 2007)
* Ji Xing (President of BAUS 2007 – present)
* Dhammadipa (Fa Yao; Abbot of CYM 2008 – present)

==Services==
'''World Peace''': Ever since the inception of Chuang Yen Monastery, visitors have been a melting pot of religious faiths. Weekends, especially Sundays, Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike visit CYM for programs including sitting and walking meditation, lectures, book discussion programs, and they enjoy a vegetarian lunch at the Dining Hall. Interfaith Prayer has been held annually on New Year’s Day to promote mutual understanding among all the religions.

'''Community Service''': Every year, events such as Chinese New Year Blessing Ceremony, Garden Party on Mother’s Day, Ritual for the Deceased, and Summer Camp have been put together. Donations are made to senior centers, fire departments, and food banks when possible. Volunteers take the initiative and coordinate events for public awareness when disasters occur around the world.

'''Free Book Distribution''' is a program where books are free for visitors and are sent to prisoners if requested. This is due to the contributions of many Buddhist masters, authors, and donators all around the world.

'''School Program''': To support educational needs in the tri-state areas and to welcome ethnic groups, volunteers with different ethnic backgrounds make a dedication to the program. Each year, CYM serves thousands of students who visit the grounds, and also accepts invitations for talks in schools, prisons, and community centers.

'''Retreat''': According to Buddhism, world peace starts from inner peace. The principle of Buddhism teaches: "Do no evil, cultivate good. Purify one’s mind." This is the teaching of Buddhism. CYM offers retreats throughout the year for people to spend time to develop inner peace. CYM invites Buddhist masters from other states or countries to conduct retreats.

The [[Flamen Dialis]] and [[Pontifex Maximus]] presided over the [[wedding]], and ten witnesses had to be present.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The woman passed directly from the hand ''(manus)'' of her father or head of household (the ''[[paterfamilias]]'') to that of her new husband.&lt;ref name="Lind2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Goran Lind|title=Common Law Marriage : A Legal Institution for Cohabitation: A Legal Institution for Cohabitation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-kJxOISFSMC&amp;pg=PA38|date=23 July 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-971053-9|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having parents who were married by ''confarreatio'' was a prerequisite for becoming a [[Vestal Virgin|Vestal]] or the [[Flamen Dialis]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; ''Confarreatio'' seems to have been limited to those whose parents were also married by ''confarreatio'', but later, perhaps with the rise of [[nobiles|plebeian ''nobiles'']], this requirement must have been relaxed.&lt;ref name="Raaflaub2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kurt A.

Divorce for ''confarreatio'' marriages, ''diffarreatio'',&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; was a difficult process and therefore rare. Not much is known about how ''diffarreatio'' was carried out except that there was a special type of sacrifice that caused the dissolution of the relationship between the man and woman. She would then pass back into the ''manus'' of her ''paterfamilias''. 

Originally, the ''confarreatio'' was indissoluble, and this remained true of the marriage of the Flamen Dialis. The other two [[Flamen#Flamines maiores|major flamines]], the [[Flamen Martialis]] and the [[Flamen Quirinalis]], were also required to marry by ''confarreatio.''&lt;ref name="Watson1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Watson|title=The State, Law, and Religion: Pagan Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiBWExO2QXsC&amp;pg=PA52|year=1992|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-1387-0|pages=52–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three major flamines were also required to marry virgins; further, if the wife of the Flamen Dialis died, he was immediately required to resign. It is not clear if this was true of the other priests.

The '''Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans''' ('''CUUPS''') is an association of [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalists]] who identify with the precepts of [[Paganism|classical]] or [[contemporary Paganism]]: celebrating the sacred circle of life and guiding people to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature.  CUUPS members foster the development of "liturgical materials based on earth- and nature-centered religious and spiritual perspectives" as well as encourage "greater use of music, dance, visual arts, poetry, story, and creative ritual in Unitarian Universalist worship and celebration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuups.org/about/vision.html CUUPS: Vision Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CUUPS was formed at the 1985 [[Unitarian Universalist Association#General Assembly|UUA General Assembly]] and incorporated as a not for profit organization in 1997. It was an Independent Affiliate of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] until 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Purpose==
CUUPS works to enrich and strengthen the [[religious pluralism]] of Unitarian Universalism; promote the study and practice of contemporary Pagan, Earth-, and nature-centered spirituality; enable networking among pagan-identified Unitarian Universalists; develop educational/liturgical materials on Pagan spirituality for Unitarian Universalist congregations; encourage theological inquiry into the contemporary Pagan resurgence; promote inter-religious dialog; and work for the healing of the Earth. While not directly related to Wicca or other explicit Pagan paths, it does embrace them within its ministerial tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puckett|first=Robert|date=2009-01-26|title=Re-enchanting the world: A weberian analysis of wiccan charisma|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/10.1163/ej.9789004163737.i-650.35|pages=121–152|doi=10.1163/ej.9789004163737.i-650.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members and friends receive the online CUUPS Bulletin, which reports continental and local chapter activities and explores contemporary Paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuups.org/ Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans, Inc.], official web site&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54940">This article lists the feast days of the General Roman Calendar as they were at the end of 1954. It is essentially the same calendar established by [[Pope Pius X]] (1903–1914) following his liturgical reforms, but it also incorporates changes that were made by [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922–1939), such as the institution of the [[Feast of Christ the King]], and the changes made by [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939–1958) prior to 1955, chief among them the imposition of the Feast of the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]] upon the universal Church (August 22, on the existing octave day of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]) in 1944, the inscription of Pius X into the General Calendar (September 3) following his 1954 canonization, and the institution of the Feast of the [[Queenship of Mary]] (May 31) in October 1954.

The changes that the latter Pope made in 1955 are indicated in [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]]. They included: a revision of the Church's traditional [[Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite|ranking of liturgical days]]; the institution of the feast of St. Joseph the Worker on May 1 as a Double of the I Class, requiring the transfer of Ss. Philip and James to May 11; the suppression of the Solemnity of Saint Joseph, which for just over a century had been celebrated on the second Wednesday after the [[Octave (liturgy)|Octave]] of Easter. A total of fifteen Octaves—all those except Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas—were also suppressed in the reform of 1955, as were most vigils (specifically, the vigils of all apostles save for that of Ss. Peter and Paul, and the vigils of the Immaculate Conception, Epiphany, and All Saints).

Five years later, [[Pope John XXIII]] made a further revision with the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Rubricarum instructum''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecclesiacatholica.com/missale%20romanum/motu%20proprio%20rubricarum%20instructum.htm&lt;/ref&gt; of July 23, 1960. This revision, the [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]], was incorporated in the [[Roman Missal]] of 1962,&lt;ref&gt;pages XLV–LIII of the reproduction on [http://www.musicasacra.com/pdf/missale62.pdf this Internet site]&lt;/ref&gt; which was issued as implementation of this ''motu proprio''&lt;ref&gt;Decree placed at the beginning of the 1962 Missal&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960 calendar is thus the calendar approved by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] with his July 7, 2007 document ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' for use as an extraordinary form of the [[Roman Rite]].

The General Roman Calendar was again revised in 1969, in connection with the revision of the [[Roman Missal]], and later. For its current state, see [[General Roman Calendar]].

For most of the celebrations here listed, the Mass is found in the Roman Missal of the time in the section called the "Proper of the Saints", but for those occurring from 24 December to 13 January it is found in the "Proper of the Season", as these days do not move with respect to the seasons of the Church year. The Offices of these feasts are likewise arranged in the Breviary.

While the General Calendar of 1954 is generally not authorized for liturgical use by traditional groups in communion with the Holy See, some [[Sedevacantism|sedevacantists]] continue to use it, as their members consider it to be the last calendar untainted by the alleged "modernist" revisions that began in 1955. Indults have already been granted, however, to certain communities in full communion with Rome, such as some apostolates of the [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]].

==Rank of feast days==
The ranking of feast days that had grown from an original division between doubles and simples&lt;ref name=CathEnc&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03158a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. ''Christian Calendar'']&lt;/ref&gt; and that by the time of the [[Tridentine Calendar]] included semidoubles, with [[Pope Clement VIII]] adding in 1604 to the distinction between first and second class doubles the new rank of greater double, was still in use in the 1954 calendar, and would continue until the following year, 1955, when [[Pope Pius XII]] abolished the rank of semidouble.

The rank of feast days determines which Mass is said when two feast days coincide (or "occur") on the one day, as well as when a feast day falls on Sundays or certain other privileged days. Feast days were classified as Simple, Semidouble, or Double, with feast days of the Double Rite further divided into ''Double of the I Class'', ''Double of the II Class'', ''Greater Double'' or ''Major Double'', and ''Double'', in order of descending rank. On ferias and many feast days of simple rank, the celebrant was permitted to substitute a Mass of his own choice such as a votive Mass, or a Mass for the Dead.

What the original meaning of the term "double" may have been is not entirely certain. Some think that the greater festivals were thus styled because the antiphons before and after the psalms were "doubled", i.e. twice repeated entire on these days. Others, with more probability, point to the fact that before the ninth century in certain places, for example at Rome, it was customary on the greater feast days to recite two sets of Matins, the one of the feria or week-day, the other of the festival. Hence such days were known as "doubles".&lt;ref name=CathEnc/&gt;

The Catholic Encyclopedia of the early years of the twentieth century shows the incremental crowding of the calendar (which had increased further by 1954) in the following table based on the official revisions of the [[Roman Breviary]] in 1568,&lt;ref&gt;For more information on this calendar of [[Pope Pius V|Pope Saint Pius V]], see [[Tridentine Calendar]].&lt;/ref&gt; 1602, 1631, 1882 and on the situation in 1907.

In 1907, when, in accordance with the rules in force since the time of [[Pope Pius V]], feast days of any form of double, if impeded by "occurrence" (falling on the same day)&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.newadvent.org/cathen/11200a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. Occurrence (in liturgy)]&lt;/ref&gt; with a feast day of higher class, were transferred to another day, this classification of feast days was of great practical importance for deciding which feast day to celebrate on any particular day. [[Pope Pius X]] simplified matters considerably in his 1911 [[Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X|reform of the Roman Breviary]]. In the case of occurrence the lower-ranking feast day could become a [[Commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]] within the celebration of the higher-ranking one. Further retouches were made by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;[[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;[[General Roman Calendar of 1960]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[[General Roman Calendar]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sundays===
Sundays were divided into greater and lesser Sundays, with the greater Sundays being further divided into two classes. The Greater Sundays of the I class were the I Sunday of Advent, the four Sundays of Lent, Passion Sunday, Palm Sunday, Easter Sunday, Low Sunday, and Pentecost. No feast day whatsoever could be celebrated on these days, although they admitted commemorations except on Easter and Pentecost. Greater Sundays of the II class permitted the celebration of Doubles of the I Class only, and consisted of the other three Sundays in Advent and the three pre-Lenten Sundays. All other Sundays (II to V after Easter and the Sundays after Epiphany and Pentecost, except for those that might occur during an Octave, which followed the rules for the Octave), were lesser Sundays or Sundays ''per annum'' ("through the year"), and only the celebration of Doubles of the I or II Class, or a feast of the Lord, took precedence over them. The Sunday within the Octave of the Nativity was a special case, due to the fixed date of [[Christmas]] and the high rank of the feast days following it. If December 29, 30, or 31 were a Sunday, the Mass assigned to it was celebrated on that day; otherwise, it was celebrated on December 30.

Before the reform of Pope St Pius X in 1911, ordinary Doubles took precedence over most of the Semidouble Sundays, resulting in many of the Sunday Masses rarely being said. While retaining the Semidouble rite for Sundays, the reform permitted only the most important feast days, Doubles of the I or II class, to be celebrated on Sunday. When a feast of the rank of double of the I or II class fell on a Sunday, the Mass would be that of the feast, with a commemoration of the occurring Sunday; the Gospel of the omitted Sunday Mass would be read at the end of Mass instead of the usual Gospel "In principio erat Verbum" of St. John. When a feast of a rank lower than that occurred with a Sunday, the feast would be commemorated in the Sunday Mass by including a commemoration of the feast, and its Gospel would be read at the end of Mass, provided it was a "proper" Gospel, i.e. one not taken from the Common.&lt;ref&gt;''Additiones et Variationes in Rubricis Missalis, IX, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the reform of Pope Pius X, only three feasts were assigned to a Sunday: the feast days of the Holy Name, the Holy Family, and the Most Holy Trinity. A fourth, [[Christ the King]], was added in 1925.

===Ferias===
Ferias also were classified into three categories:

* Greater privileged ferias: Ash Wednesday and Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of Holy Week. No feast day could be celebrated on these days.
* Greater non-privileged ferias: The ferias of Advent, Lent, and Passion Week, Rogation Monday, and the [[Ember Days]]. Any feast day except a Simple could occur on these days, with a commemoration of the feria.
* On all other ferias, any feast day of whatever rank could be celebrated without any commemoration of the feria.

Ember Days are four separate sets of three days within the same week — specifically, the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday — roughly equidistant in the circuit of the year, that were formerly set aside for fasting and prayer. These days set apart for special prayer and fasting were considered especially suitable for the ordination of clergy. The Ember Days are known in Latin as ''quatuor tempora'' (the "four seasons"), or ''jejunia quatuor temporum'' ("fasts of the four seasons"). They occur in the weeks between the third and fourth Sundays of Advent, between the first and second Sundays of Lent, between Pentecost and Trinity Sunday, and beginning the first Wednesday after the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (September 14), which is between the liturgical third and fourth Sundays of September.&lt;ref&gt;The rubrics of the Breviary defined the liturgical first Sunday of August, September, October and November, which primarily determined which books of Scripture were read during that week at Matins, as the Sunday closest to the first day of the month, in this manner: "That which is called the I Sunday of the month, is that which is on the [[Kalends]], or nearest the Kalends of that month: so that, if the Kalends be Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, then the I Sunday of the month, on which the book of Scripture to be begun is placed, is that which precedes the Kalends. But if Thursday or Friday, or Saturday, it is that which follows." The first Sunday of September, therefore, could fall between 29 August and 4 September. The 1960 reforms changed this to the actual first Sunday of the month, which also adjusted the possible dates of the September Ember Days.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogation Days are, in the calendar of the Western Church, four days traditionally set apart for solemn processions to invoke God's mercy. They are April 25, the Major Rogation (or Greater Litanies), coinciding with St. Mark's Day (but transferred to the following Tuesday if they fell on Easter); and the three days preceding Ascension Thursday, the Minor Rogations (or Lesser Litanies). These are indicated below in the main body of the calendar and in the Movable Feasts section.

===Vigils===
In the [[Tridentine Calendar]] the vigils of Christmas, the Epiphany, and Pentecost were called "major vigils"; the rest were "minor" or "common" vigils&lt;ref name=CE:Vigil&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05647a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Eve of a Feast]&lt;/ref&gt; In early times, every feast day had a vigil, but the increase in the number of feast days and abuses connected with the evening and night service of which the vigils originally consisted, led to their diminishment. Nevertheless, the [[Roman Rite]] kept many more vigils than other [[Latin liturgical rites]] such as the [[Ambrosian Rite]] and the [[Mozarabic Rite]]. If a Vigil fell on a Sunday, it was transferred to the previous Saturday,&lt;ref name=CE:Vigil/&gt; although the Vigil of Christmas took precedence over the IV Sunday of Advent.

Prior to the suppression of some vigils by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1955, there were three classes of Vigils. The Vigils of Christmas and Pentecost were of the I class, and took precedence over any feast day. The Vigil of Epiphany was of the II class, and permitted only Doubles of the I or II classes, or any feast of the Lord. All other vigils were "common" and took precedence only over ferias and Simple feast days, but were anticipated on Saturday if they fell on Sunday. Most feasts of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] had Vigils; the exceptions being those that fell in Eastertide, when Vigils were not permitted. The Vigil of St. Matthias was unique, in that it was normally commemorated on February 23, the feast day of St. Peter Damian, but in leap year, was kept on February 24, the traditional leap day of the [[Julian calendar#Julian reform|Roman calendar]].

===Octaves===
The [[Tridentine Calendar]] had many octaves, without any indication in the calendar itself of distinction of rank between them, apart from the fact that the Octave Day (the final day of the octave) was ranked higher than the days within the octave. Several octaves overlapped, so that, for instance, on 29 December the prayer of the saint of the day, Saint [[Thomas Becket]], was followed by the prayers of [[Christmas]], of [[Saint Stephen]], of Saint [[John the Evangelist]] and of the [[Holy Innocents]]. The situation remained such until the reform of [[Pope Pius X]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=LCCN33036844&amp;id=E7sPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP34&amp;lpg=PP34&amp;dq=missale+romanum&amp;as_brr=1#PPP3,M1 ''Missale Romanum'', published by Pustet in 1862]&lt;/ref&gt;

To cut down on the monotony of repeating the same prayers in Mass and Office every day for eight days, Pope Pius X classified the octaves as "privileged", "common" or "simple"

The privileged octaves were of three "ranks".&lt;ref&gt;"Ordo" in Latin, not "classis" (class), the word used for feast days, the word that was also used in Pope John XXIII's revision of the rubrics for all kinds of liturgical days.&lt;/ref&gt; The first rank belonged to the octaves of Easter and Pentecost (no feast day could be celebrated in these octaves or even, until Vespers on Tuesday, be commemorated), the second to those of Epiphany and Corpus Christi (the Octave Day ranked as a Greater Double, the days within the octave as Semidoubles, giving way only to Doubles of the I Class, and on the Octave day itself only to a Double of the I class that was celebrated in the entire Church), the third rank to those of Christmas, the Ascension, and the Sacred Heart (these gave way to any feast day above the level of Simple).

The common octaves were those of the Immaculate Conception, the Assumption, the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, the Solemnity of Saint Joseph, Saints Peter and Paul, and All Saints, as well as, locally, the principal patron saint of a church, cathedral, order, town, diocese, province, or nation. These too gave way to any feast day above the level of Simple; the difference between these and the third privileged rank was that ferial psalms were said during common octaves, while the psalms from the feast day were used during privileged octaves.

The simple octaves were those of [[Saint Stephen]], Saint [[John the Evangelist]], the [[Holy Innocents]], Saint Lawrence, the Nativity of Mary and, locally, secondary patrons. These were all Doubles of the II class, their Octave day was a Simple and, in contrast to the situation before Pope Pius X, their Mass was not repeated nor a Commemoration made, except on the Octave day, as simple Octaves had no days within the Octave.

In Pope Pius XII's reform, only the octaves of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost were kept.&lt;ref&gt;De rubricis, 11&lt;/ref&gt; The days within the Easter and Pentecost octaves were raised to double rite, had precedence over all feast days, and did not admit commemorations.&lt;ref&gt;De rubricis, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

*29: St. [[Martha]] Virgin, Semidouble, Com. of Ss. [[Antipope Felix II|Felix II]] Pope,&lt;ref&gt;It is perhaps unclear when the identification of the Saint Felix of 29 July with [[Antipope Felix II]] was abandoned. The identification is still found in the [http://www.sanctamissa.org/EN/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html 1920 typical edition of the Roman Missal, with feasts updated to the late 1920s], but does not appear in the [http://www.musicasacra.com/pdf/missale62.pdf 1962 typical edition], which calls him simply a martyr (see [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]]). The 1952 Marietti printing of the Missal, which precedes 1954, the reference year for this article, also omits the numeral "II" and the word "Papae", however, the 1952 Pustet and the 1956 Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis printings of the Breviary still list Felix as a Pope and with the numeral II. The baselessness of the identification was recognized long before: in its 1909 article on [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06030a.htm Felix II] the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] referred to this identification as a "distortion of the true facts".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simplicius, Faustinus and Beatrix|Simplicius, Faustinus, and Beatrice]] Martyrs.

==Moveable feasts==
The moveable feasts are those connected with the Easter cycle, and Easter is the date relative to which their position is ultimately determined. The date of Easter is determined relative to the lunar calendar as used by the Hebrews. The rule has since the Middle Ages been phrased as "Easter is observed on the Sunday after the first full moon on or after the day of the vernal equinox." However, this does not reflect the actual ecclesiastical rules precisely. One reason for this is that the full moon involved (called the Paschal full moon) is not an astronomical full moon, but an ecclesiastical moon. Another difference is that the astronomical vernal equinox is a natural astronomical phenomenon, which can fall on 20 or 21 March, while the ecclesiastical vernal equinox is a fixed March 21 (on the Gregorian Calendar). Easter is determined from tables which determine Easter based on the ecclesiastical rules described above, which do not always coincide with the astronomical full moon. The moveable feasts are given below:

Septuagesima Sunday (9th Sunday before Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Sexagesima Sunday (8th Sunday before Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Quinquagesima Sunday (7th Sunday before Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Ash Wednesday (Wednesday after Quinquagesima Sunday)&lt;br&gt;
Passion Sunday (Sunday 2 weeks before Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Feast of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin Mary (Friday after 2nd Sunday before Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Palm Sunday (Sunday before Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Holy Thursday (Thursday before Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Good Friday (Friday before Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Holy Saturday (Saturday before Easter)&lt;br&gt;

Low Sunday (Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
The Solemnity of St. Joseph, spouse of the Virgin Mary, confessor, and patron of the Universal Church (Wednesday after the 2nd Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
The Octave of St. Joseph, spouse of the Virgin Mary, confessor and patron of the Universal Church (Wednesday after the 3rd Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
The Lesser Litanies at St. Mary Major (Monday after the 5th Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
The Lesser Litanies at St. John Lateran (Tuesday after the 5th Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
The Vigil of the Ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Lesser Litanies at St. Peter's (Wednesday after the 5th Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
The Ascension (Thursday after the 5th Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
The Octave of the Ascension (Thursday after the 6th Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
The Vigil of Pentecost (Saturday after the 6th Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Pentecost (7th Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Holy Trinity and the Octave of Pentecost (8th Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Corpus Christi (Thursday after the 8th Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Octave of Corpus Christi (Thursday after the 9th Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Sacred Heart of Jesus (Friday after the 9th Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
Octave of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (Friday after the 10th Sunday after Easter)&lt;br&gt;
The 1954 calendar assigned special celebrations also to the days within these Octaves, as to the days within the Octaves of fixed feasts.

He was an investigative reporter of the kind known in early 20th century as a [[muckraker]], using his journalism to fight injustice and justify reform. But by his time the public mood had changed, and reader demand for muckraking was much weaker. According to historian Helen Fordham, Seldes's career demonstrates how those who crusaded too vehemently seemed to violate new standards of impartiality and objectivity. His work was often criticized as too radical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Fordham |first = Helen |date = November 17, 2016 |title = Subversive Voices: George Seldes and Mid-Twentieth-Century Muckraking |url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08821127.2016.1241643 |journal = American Journalism |volume = 33 |issue = 4 |pages = 424–441 |doi = 10.1080/08821127.2016.1241643 |access-date = January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[Lincoln Steffens]] and [[Walter Lippmann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/americanjournali13amer |date=Winter 1996 |title=American journalism |publisher=American Journalism Historians Association |pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0eHB6xgXgHgC |last=Seldes |first=George |title=China Monthly Review, Volume 76 |location=East Asia |publisher=[[John W. Powell]] |pages=106 |quote=I agree with Walter Lippmann who a decade ago wrote that the crisis of democracy is a crisis in journalism, and again I agree that 'those who think the sole cause is corruption,' are wrong.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seldes's career began when he was hired at the ''[[Pittsburgh Leader]]'' at the age of 19.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; In 1914, he was appointed night editor of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post]]''.

In 1916, he went to the [[United Press]] in London. In 1917, during World War I, he moved to France to work at the Marshall Syndicate. While there, he interviewed [[Paul von Hindenburg]], the supreme commander of the German Army. Hindenburg commented on Germany's defeat in the war, including U.S. involvement, and the interview was censored by the U. S. military. Seldes later claimed the interview's publication could have prevented the [[Nazis]]' rise to power and thus World War II.&lt;ref name="wwi_book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gs_ob_pra" /&gt;

After World War I, Seldes spent ten years as a reporter for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. In 1922, he interviewed [[Vladimir Lenin]], and in 1923 he was expelled from the Soviet Union, along with three colleagues, for disguising news reports as personal letters; a letter his publisher wrote for the Soviets only facilitated his expulsion.&lt;ref name="mccormick_1" /&gt; The newspaper then sent him to Italy, where he implicated [[Benito Mussolini]] in opposition leader [[Giacomo Matteotti]]'s murder. He was again expelled.&lt;ref name="gs_exp"/&gt;

In 1927, Seldes reported for the ''Chicago Tribune'' in Mexico, where he criticized the use of the country's mineral rights by American companies. He battled with the ''Tribune's'' owner and publisher, Colonel Robert McCormick, over the paper's altering of his Mexico articles, and soon afterward quit the ''Tribune'' over what he considered to be censorship.

In 1929, Seldes became a freelance reporter and author, subsequently writing [[#Works|a series of books]] [[#Freelance|and criticism]] about his years as a foreign correspondent, and the issues of censorship, suppression and distortion in the press. During the late 1930s he had one more stint as a foreign correspondent, with his wife Helen, for the New York ''Post'', in Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

In 1940, Seldes co-founded a weekly newsletter, [[#In Fact|''In Fact'']], subtitled "an Antidote to Falsehoods in the Daily Press." In it, he attacked corporate malfeasance, often using government documents from the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). He exposed the health hazards of cigarettes and attacked the mainstream press for suppressing them, blaming the newspapers' heavy dependence on cigarette advertising. He cited [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and the [[FBI]] for anti-union campaigns, and brought attention to the [[National Association of Manufacturers]]' use of advertising dollars to produce news stories favorable to its members and suppress unfavorable ones.&lt;ref name="indobit" /&gt;

[[#Critical reception|Having both staunch admirers and strong critics]], Seldes influenced some younger journalists. He received an award for professional excellence from the [[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication|Association for Education in Journalism]] in 1980&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; and a [[George Polk Award]] for his life's work in 1981.&lt;ref name="gpaward" /&gt; Seldes also served on the board of [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR).&lt;ref name="berlet" /&gt;

==Family==
The writer and critic [[Gilbert Seldes]] was George Seldes's younger brother. Actress [[Marian Seldes]] was his niece; his nephew was the literary agent Timothy Seldes.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;

He was married to Helen Larkin Seldes, née Wiesman, from 1932 to her death in 1979.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

==Early years==
Henry George Seldes, named after economist [[Henry George]],&lt;ref name="hermes"/&gt; was born on November 16, 1890, to ethnic Jewish émigrés from Russia in [[Alliance Colony]], an agricultural community in rural southern New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1265&amp;letter=A&amp;search=alliance%20colony |title=Alliance |last1=Reis |first1=J.

When he was 19, Seldes went to work at the ''[[Pittsburgh Leader]]''. An early scoop of his for this paper was when two-time presidential candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]] expelled Seldes from Bryan's hotel room.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; He also interviewed a saleswoman who had filed a rape complaint against the son of the owner on a large [[department store]], but the story was not published, and Seldes became outraged when the advertising department of the newspaper [[blackmail]]ed the owner into buying more advertising.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; In 1914, he was appointed night editor of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post]]''. As a young journalist, he was influenced by the investigative journalism of [[muckraker]] [[Lincoln Steffens]], whom he met in 1919.

==World War I==
In 1916, Seldes moved to London where he worked for the [[United Press]]. When the United States joined the [[First World War]] in 1917, Seldes was sent to France where he worked as the war correspondent for the [[Marshall Syndicate]].

At end of the war, he obtained an exclusive interview with [[Paul von Hindenburg]], the supreme commander of the German Army, in which Hindenburg acknowledged the role America had played in defeating Germany. "The American infantry," said Hindenburg, "won the World War in battle in the Argonne." Seldes and the others were accused of breaking the [[Armistice]] and were [[court martial]]ed. They were also forbidden to write anything about the interview and it never appeared in American news media. Seldes believed that blocking publication of this interview proved tragic. Unaware of Hindenburg's direct testimony of Germany's military defeat, Germans adopted the ''[[Dolchstoss]]'' or "stab-in-the-back" theory that Germany had only lost the war because it was betrayed at home by "the socialists, the Communists and the Jews," which served as [[Nazism]]'s explanation for Germany's defeat. "If the Hindenburg interview had been passed by [[John J. Pershing|Pershing]]'s censors at the time, it would have been headlined in every country civilized enough to have newspapers and undoubtedly would have made an impression on millions of people and became an important page in history," wrote Seldes. "I believe it would have destroyed the main planks on which Hitler rose to power, it would have prevented World War II, the greatest and worst war in all history, and it would have changed the future of all mankind."&lt;ref name="wwi_book"&gt;{{cite book |title=Witness to a Century |last=Seldes |first=George |year=1987 |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gs_ob_pra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publiceye.org/glossary/seldes.html#fairobit |title=Great Press Critic Leaves a Legacy of Courage |last1=Solomon |first1=Norman |authorlink1=Norman Solomon |last2=Cohen |first2=Jeff |authorlink2=Jeff Cohen (media critic) |date=July 1995 |work=PublicEye.org |publisher=Political Research Associates |accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seldes claimed that the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]] never happened. In his account, General Pershing planned to capture the city, but on September 1 the Germans decided to remove their forces from Saint-Mihiel to reinforce other positions. Seldes claimed no shots were fired as the first Americans, he among them, entered the city on September 13 to be greeted as liberators before General Pershing, [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]], and other high-ranking officers arrived. The thousands of German prisoners captured, he wrote, were taken as they mistakenly arrived at the train station days later to relieve the German troops that had left days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Even the Gods Can't Change History |last=Seldes |first=George |chapter=Chapter 1: First Encounter with the Goddess of History: Saint-Mihiel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lenin and Mussolini==
[[File:George Seldes young.jpg|thumb|right|Picture of a young George Seldes for a ''Chicago Tribune'' filecard. Notice the ''Chicago Tribune'' stamp]]

Seldes spent the next ten years as an international reporter for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. He interviewed [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] in 1922. He and three other reporters were expelled in 1923 when Soviet authorities, who routinely censored foreign reporters' telegraphed dispatches, found articles by the four reporters, disguised as personal letters, being smuggled out in a diplomatic mailpouch to avoid censorship. The expulsion was facilitated, according to Seldes, after his publisher, Colonel Robert McCormick, failed to show sufficient respect when writing to the Soviets to protest censorship.&lt;ref name="mccormick_1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Letters |last=Colonel McCormick |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert R. McCormick |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808220-2,00.html |newspaper=TIME |date=March 5, 1956 |accessdate=January 11, 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chicago Tribune'' sent him to [[Italy]] where he wrote about [[Benito Mussolini]] and the rise of fascism. (Mussolini had served as Seldes's [[stringer (journalism)|stringer]] before the former took power.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |last=Guttenplan |first=John |date=July 14, 1995 |title=OBITUARY: George Seldes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-george-seldes-1591344.html |newspaper=The Independent |location= London |access-date=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) He investigated the murder of [[Giacomo Matteotti]], the head of the parliamentary section of the Italian [[Unitary Socialist Party (Italy, 1922)|Unitary Socialist Party]]. His article implicated Mussolini in the killing, and Seldes was expelled from Italy.&lt;ref name="gs_exp"&gt;{{cite news |title=Foreign News: Ousted |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,720698,00.html |newspaper=TIME |date=August 10, 1925 |accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote an account of Italian censorship and intimidation of American reporters for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Italy: Censorship Bared |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,731121,00.html |newspaper=TIME |date=October 31, 1927 |accessdate=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the ''Chicago Tribune'' sent Seldes to [[Mexico]], but his articles criticizing American corporations for their use of that country's [[mineral rights]] were not well received. Seldes returned to Europe, but found that his work increasingly censored to fit the political views of the newspaper's owner, [[Robert R. McCormick]].

==Freelance==
Disillusioned, Seldes left the ''Tribune'' and went to work as a freelance writer. In his first two books, ''You Can't Print That!'' (1929) and ''Can These Things Be!'' (1931), Seldes included material that he had not been allowed to publish in the ''Tribune''. His next book, ''World Panorama'' (1933), was a narrative history of the interbellum period. In 1932 he married Helen Larkin Wiesman (later Seldes), who died in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

In 1934, Seldes published a history of the Roman Catholic Church, ''The Vatican''. This was followed by an exposé of the global arms industry, ''Iron, Blood and Profits'' (1934) and an account of Benito Mussolini, ''Sawdust Caesar'' (1935).

Two books on the newspaper business established his enduring reputation as a critic of the press: ''Freedom of the Press'' (1935) and ''Lords of the Press'' (1938).&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; He took the title of the latter from a speech by Secretary of the Interior [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]]: "Our ancestors did not fight for the right of a few Lords of the Press to have almost exclusive control of and censorship over the dissemination of news and ideas."&lt;ref name="gibson14" /&gt; He believed "that advertisers were a far greater threat to journalistic freedom than government censorship."&lt;ref name="indobit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: George Seldes |last1=Guttenplan |first1=John |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-george-seldes-1591344.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=July 14, 1995 |accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press and news, he wrote, "are coming more and more under the domination of a handful of corporate publishers who may print such news as they wish to print and omit such news as they do not wish to print."&lt;ref name="gibson14"&gt;{{cite book |title=Communication, Power, and Media |last=Gibson |first=Donald |year=2004 |publisher=Nova Science |location=Hauppauge, NY |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' was initially positive in its response: "A rambling but effective attack on U. S. newspapers, charging coloring, distortion or suppression of vital news, containing some enlightening instances of journalistic malpractices as George Seldes encountered them during his career as correspondent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fiction: Recent Books |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,749111,00.html |newspaper=TIME |date=September 23, 1935 |quote=FREEDOM OF THE PRESS—George Seldes—Bobbs-Merrill ($2.75).

He also reported on the [[Spanish Civil War]] on a freelance basis for three years and later said that American reporters too readily accepted what the Franco side wanted them to believe.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

On his return to the United States in 1940, Seldes published ''Witch Hunt'', an account of the persecution of people with left-wing political views in America, and ''The Catholic Crisis'', which sought to demonstrate the close relationship between the [[Catholic Church]] and fascist organizations in Europe. When ''Time'' reviewed the latter, it noted several of Seldes' works and said he "stuck out his tongue at Benito Mussolini ... thumbed his nose at U. S. journalism ... and uttered some hoarse Bronx cheers at the Roman Catholic Church." The review complained that his detailed accounts of church activities were "in part damaging" but "not all germane to the subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Religion: Seldes vs. Rome |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762893,00.html |newspaper=TIME |date=November 7, 1929 |accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''In Fact''==

[[File:Orange-Seldes-In Fact-Draft Dodgers-1600.png|thumb|right|Cover of volume IX of edition 22 of ''In Fact, An Antidote for Falsehood in the Daily Press'']]
From 1940 to 1950, Seldes published a political newsletter, ''In Fact'' which originally had the full name ''In Fact: For the millions who want a free press''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/InFactVolume1IssueNumber1/InFactVolINo.1#page/n0/mode/1up ''In Fact'', Volume 1, Issue Number 1]&lt;/ref&gt; and later ''In Fact: An Antidote for Falsehood in the Daily Press'', "a four-page weekly compendium of news other newspapers wouldn't print."&lt;ref name="indobit" /&gt; Washington Post editor and later press critic [[Ben Bagdikian]] said, "When Seldes was no longer printed by the mainstream press, he was an important conduit to the journalistic community, who knew that there were flaws in the system, but often couldn't get printed in their own newspapers, because the press cannot be a watchdog on itself. So they fed stories critical of the press to Seldes."&lt;ref name = "kovno1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kovnocommunications.org/films/tell-the-truth-and-run/ |title=Tell the Truth and Run: George Seldes and the American Press |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website= |publisher=Kovno Communications |accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of its popularity it had a circulation of 176,000.

One of the first articles published in the newsletter concerned the dangers of cigarette smoking.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news |title=George Seldes Is Dead at 104; An Early, Fervent Press Critic |last1=Dicke |first1=William |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/03/obituaries/george-seldes-is-dead-at-104-an-early-fervent-press-critic.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 3, 1995 |accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seldes later explained that at the time, "The tobacco stories were suppressed by every major newspaper. For ten years we pounded on tobacco as being one of the only legal poisons you could buy in America." At a time when tobacco companies were major advertisers, Seldes discussed the contents of a study called, "Tobacco Smoking and Longevity", which he said had been suppressed since 1939.&lt;ref name="indobit" /&gt; Throughout the 10-year run of ''In Fact'', Seldes published more than 50 stories on the health effects of tobacco, and the cigarette industry's attempts and suppressing such news.

Among the favorite targets of ''In Fact'' was the [[National Association of Manufacturers]].&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; Defense analyst [[Daniel Ellsberg]], who subscribed to ''In Fact'' while an undergrad at Harvard, said, "I heard about the National Association of Manufacturers first from Seldes and more from Seldes than I ever heard again. If you were to read the mainstream press, you'd hardly become aware that such organizations existed, that businessmen worked together to pursue their own interests."&lt;ref name = "kovno1"/&gt; ''In Fact'' also attacked [[Charles Lindbergh]] for his Nazi sympathies, the [[American Legion]] for helping to break strikes,&lt;ref name="indobit" /&gt; and labeled many captains of industry as "native fascists." Consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]] said, "[Seldes] used the word fascism to reflect an authoritarian state of mind that tended to stifle free speech and dissent and also tended to believe that might was right."&lt;ref name = "kovno1" /&gt;

''In Fact'' immediately attracted the attention of government authorities. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] ordered an FBI investigation of Seldes and ''In Fact'' in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Reilly |first1=Kenneth |year=1982 |title=A New Deal for the FBI: The Roosevelt Administration, Crime Control, and National Security |journal=Journal of American History |volume=69 |issue=649 |pages= 638|publisher= |doi= 10.2307/1903141|url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles claiming that the FBI was infiltrating unions and monitoring union activities resulted in FBI surveillance of Seldes and his publication. [[J. Edgar Hoover]] sent Seldes a 15-page letter denying such FBI activities.&lt;ref name="lasar"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lasar |first1=Matthew |year=1998 |title='Right Out in Public': Pacifica Radio, the Cold War, and the Political Origins of Alternative Media |journal=Pacific Historical Review |volume=67 |issue=537 |pages= 513–541|publisher= |doi= 10.2307/3641185|url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI subsequently questioned ''In Fact'' subscribers, particularly servicemen and women, and had US postal officials reporting to the FBI on Seldes' mail correspondence. ''In Fact'' lost many of its subscribers in the late 1940s. Seldes later claimed that his critical coverage of Yugoslavia got the publication banned from Communist Party bookstores. The political climate discouraged subscriptions on the part of less ideologically committed readers as well.&lt;ref name="lasar"/&gt; ''In Fact'' ceased publication in 1950. ''[[I. F. Stone|I. F. Stone's Weekly]]'', which started publication in 1953, took ''In Fact'' as its model.&lt;ref name="indobit" /&gt;

In addition to writing his newsletter, Seldes continued to publish books. These included ''Facts and Fascism'' (1943) and ''One Thousand Americans'' (1947), an account of the people who controlled America. ''Time'' called ''One Thousand Americans'' "a collection of truths, half-truths and untruths about the U.S. press and industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Press: The Beaver's World |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798474-2,00.html|newspaper=TIME |date=April 26, 1948 |accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''One Thousand Americans'' introduced a wide audience to the [[Business Plot]], a supposed plan of America's corporate elite to overthrow the U.S. government in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=One Thousand Americans |last=Seldes |first=George |year=1947 |publisher=Boni &amp; Gaer |location=New York |isbn=  |pages=79, 179–80, 208–10, 287–92 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seldes published ''The People Don't Know'' on the origins of the [[Cold War]] in 1949.

==Politics and later career==
According to KGB documents, Seldes was a longtime secret member of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party]] since well before 1940, valued for his "major connections" in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America |last1=Haynes |first1=John Earl |authorlink1=John Earl Haynes |last2=Vassiliev |first2=Alexander |authorlink2=Alexander Vassiliev |last3=Klehr |first3=Harvey |authorlink3=Harvey Klehr |year=2009 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-12390-6 |page=169 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCAVQ_cdomcC |accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/docs/Black%20Notebook%20Translated1.pdf |title=Black Notebook |last1=Vassiliev |first1=Alexander |last2=Redko |first2=Philip |last3=Haynes |first3=John Earl |date=January 9, 2011 |work= |publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |page=512 |accessdate=January 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711055816/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/docs/Black%20Notebook%20Translated1.pdf |archivedate=July 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seldes later wrote that ''In Fact'' was founded at the instigation of the U.S. Communist Party leadership, but he wrote that the Party worked through his partner Bruce Minton (also known as Richard Bransten) without his knowledge. Seldes wrote that he was unaware that Minton was a Party member who received the funds to start ''In Fact'' from Communist Party.{{Ref label|aab|ab}}&lt;ref name="cp_affair"&gt;{{cite book |title=Never Tire of Protesting |last=Seldes |first=George |year=1968 |publisher=L. Stuart |location=New York |isbn= |pages=53, 56, 195, 197, 198, 200, 201, 203, 204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While his political positions often were similar to those in the Party in 1940, by 1948 Seldes was writing in positive terms of the [[Titoism|anti-Soviet communism]] of [[Marshal Tito]] in Yugoslavia, earning him the wrath of many Communist Party loyalists in the United States. As the [[Cold War]] took shape at the end of the decade, Seldes lost readership from both the Communists and the anti-liberal-left sentiment that was sweeping the country, including a trade union movement that had contained some of his largest audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seldes |first=George |authorlink= |title=Never Tire of Protesting |url= |accessdate= |year=1968 |publisher=L. Stuart |location=New York |isbn= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nationwide atmosphere of [[McCarthyism]] and [[red-baiting]] further diminished his subscribers' numbers, and he was financially forced to close ''In Fact'', which never accepted advertising, in October 1950.

Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] subpoenaed Seldes in 1953, Seldes vehemently denied [[CPUSA|Communist Party]] membership and was "cleared" by McCarthy's Senate subcommittee, but Seldes's greatest influence on readers had already passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Letters |first=George |last=Seldes |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,819887-2,00.html |newspaper=TIME |date=May 31, 1954 |accessdate=January 11, 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seldes did publish ''Tell the Truth and Run'' in 1953, but otherwise found it difficult to publish his work throughout the 1950s. He was approached, however, by an old friend and colleague, I.F. Stone, for advice on how to start a small independent investigative newspaper. ''I.F. Stone's Weekly'' premiered in 1953, picking up where Seldes had left off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |last=Goldsmith |first=Rick |year=1996 |title=Tell the Truth and Run: George Seldes and the American Press |trans-title=|medium= |url= |accessdate=August 18, 2013 |format= |time= |publisher=Kovno Communications |location= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Largely dropping his own writing, he developed an anthology called ''The Great Quotations'' and received rejections from 20 publishers. It sold more than a million copies when it appeared in 1961.&lt;ref name="indobit" /&gt;

In a letter to ''Time'' magazine in 1974, he appraised the state of American journalism as much improved in his lifetime:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Letters |first=George |last=Seldes |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911431,00.html |newspaper=TIME |date=July 29, 1974 |accessdate=January 11, 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The press deserved the attacks and criticisms of [[Will Irwin]] (1910) and [[Upton Sinclair]] (1920) and the muckrakers who followed, and it needs today the watchdog and gadfly activities of the new critical weeklies, but all in all it is now a better medium of mass information ... The 1972 [[Watergate]] disclosures, it is true, were made by only a score of the members of the mass media, but I remember [[Teapot Dome]] when only one of our 1,750 dailies (the Albuquerque Morning Journal) dared to tell the truth about White House corruption. We have come a long way since.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He published ''Never Tire of Protesting'' in 1968 and ''Even the Gods Can't Change History'' in 1976.

The [[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication|Association for Education in Journalism]] gave him an award for professional excellence in 1980.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; In 1981 he received the [[George Polk Award]] for his life's work.&lt;ref name="gpaward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liu.edu/About/News/Polk/Previous.aspx |title=Previous Award Winners |work= |publisher=Long Island University |accessdate=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He published his autobiography, ''Witness to a Century'' in 1987. He wrote: "And so [my brother] Gilbert and I, brought up without a formal religion, remained throughout our lifetimes just what Father was, freethinkers. And, likewise, doubters and dissenters and perhaps Utopians. Father's rule had been 'Question everything, take nothing for granted,' and I never outlived it, and I would suggest it be made the motto of a world journalists' association."

In 1981, Seldes appeared in [[Warren Beatty]]'s ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'', a film about the life of journalist [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]]. Seldes appears as one of the film's "witnesses" commenting on the historical events depicted in the film.

Seldes served on the board of [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR).&lt;ref name="berlet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publiceye.org/glossary/seldes.html#chipobit |title=Press Critic and Antifascist George Seldes Dies at 104 in Vermont |last1=Berlet |first1=Chip |authorlink=Chip Berlet |work=PublicEye.org |publisher=Political Research Associates |accessdate=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin A. Lee and Norman Solomon used a quote from Seldes as an epigraph for their book ''Unreliable Sources'': "The most sacred cow of the press is the press itself."&lt;ref name="berlet" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Unreliable Sources: A Guide to Detecting Bias in the Media |last1=Lee |first1=Martin A. |authorlink1=Martin A.

==Death and legacy==
Seldes died on July 2, 1995, in [[Windsor, Vermont]]. He was 104. A delegation of journalists attended the memorial service at his home in [[Hartland, Vermont|Hartland-4-Corners, Vermont]], read from his books and watched an excerpt from ''[[Tell the Truth and Run: George Seldes and the American Press]],'' a documentary in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publiceye.org/glossary/seldes.html#seldcomm |title=Seldes Remembrance Committee |last1=Solomon |first1=Norman |authorlink1=Norman Solomon |last2=Cohen |first2=Jeff |authorlink2=Jeff Cohen (media critic) |work=PublicEye.org |publisher=Political Research Associates |accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary was produced and directed by Rick Goldsmith and premiered the following year, in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117873/|title=Tell the Truth and Run: George Seldes and the American Press (1996)|work=|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covered Seldes's life and career, and revived the life and work of a man who for four decades had been largely forgotten. The film looked at Seldes's life and work, especially the theme of censorship and suppression in America's news media. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, and received many other accolades, including the John O'Connor Film Award from the American Historical Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historians.org/prizes/awarded/OconnorWinner.cfm |title=John E.

==Critical reception==
Seldes had both staunch admirers and strong critics. Some of his contemporaries and later historians have judged much of his work harshly. One critic thought [[I. F. Stone]] "was light years beyond Seldes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boylan |first1=James |last2=Cottrell |first2=Robert C. |year=1993 |title=Izzy: A Biography of I.F. Stone |journal=Journal of American History |volume=80 |issue=1157-8 |pages= 1157|publisher=Oxford University Press and Organization of American Historians |doi= 10.2307/2080554|url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others cited his political bias and preconceptions. A study of the Dies Committee said that Seldes's account in ''Witch Hunt'' suffered from his view that everything the Committee did was wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dies Committee: A Study of the Special House Committee for the Investigation of Un-American Activities, 1938–1944 |last=Ogden |first=August Raymond |year=1943 |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn= |pages=55, 64, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another warned that ''The Catholic Crisis'' "should be read with great caution in view of the author's latent anti-Catholic and pro-Communist bias."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eulau |first1=Heinz |year=1947 |title=Proselytizing in the Catholic Press |journal=Public Opinion Quarterly |volume=1 |issue= |pages=195 |publisher= |doi= 10.1086/265843|url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cited Seldes as a writer with "an agenda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Jenkins |first=Philip |encyclopedia=Pennsylvania History |title='It Can't Happen Here': Fascism and Right-Wing Extremism in Pennsylvania, 1933–1942 |trans-title=|url= |accessdate= |language= |edition= |year=1995 |publisher= |volume=62 |location= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |pages=52 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still another evaluated ''Iron, Blood, and Profits'' as "less sober" than other works on the subject of international arms dealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Langer |first=William W. |year=1934 |title=Some Recent Books on International Relations |encyclopedia=Foreign Affairs |publisher= |volume=12 |location= |id= |pages=690}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of his biography of Mussolini, another wrote: "many of his sources were unreliable and his book was almost devoid of logical order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Detzell |first1=Charles F. |year=1963 |title=Benito Mussolini: A Guide to the Biographical Literature |journal=Journal of Modern History |volume=35 |issue= |pages=345 |publisher= |doi= 10.1086/243817|url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more appreciative assessment said ''Freedom of the Press'' was "one-sided, but well deserves careful reading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Langer |first=William W. |year=1936 |title=Some Recent Books on International Relations |encyclopedia=Foreign Affairs |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20030753?uid=3738880&amp;uid=2460338415&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=83&amp;uid=63&amp;sid=21104677507847 |accessdate=September 24, 2014 |volume=14 |location= |id= |pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summing up Seldes's work, another wrote that "until 1947 [Seldes] followed the Stalinist line so closely that any author must use him with the utmost care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Doenecke |first1=Justus D. |last2=Edwards |first2=John Carver |year=1992 |title=Berlin Calling: American Broadcasters in Service to the Third Reich |journal=International History Review |volume=14 |issue=600–2 |pages= |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=London |doi= 10.2307/40106635|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/40106635?uid=3738880&amp;uid=2460338415&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=83&amp;uid=63&amp;sid=21104677507847 |accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. J. Liebling]] said on him, "[George Seldes is] about as subtle as a house falling in. He makes too much of the failure of newspapers to print exactly what George Seldes would have printed if he were the managing editor. But he is a useful citizen. In fact is a fine little gadfly, representing an enormous effort for one man and his wife".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasscheck.com/seldes/bio.html |title=The Forgotten Man of American Journalism: A Brief Biography of George Seldes |last1=Holhut |first1=Randolph T. |website= |publisher=Brasscheck |accessdate=August 20, 2013 |quote='He's about as subtle as a house falling in', wrote fellow press critic A.J. Liebling in his classic 1947 book, 'The Wayward Pressman'. 'He makes too much of the failure of newspapers to print exactly what George Seldes would have printed if he were the managing editor. But he is a useful citizen. (In fact) is a fine little gadfly, representing an enormous effort for one man and his wife'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But a whole generation of journalists and activists were influenced greatly by Seldes. Long-time ''Washington Post'' columnist [[Colman McCarthy]] said, "He was a reporter who didn't worry about being objective. He worried about what he would choose to write. I'm always amused when they call somebody 'one-sided'. Seldes offered one side – the side you weren't getting elsewhere".&lt;ref name = "kovno1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=George Seldes: Giant of Journalism |first=Colman |last=McCarthy |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/18603769.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jul+11%2C+1995&amp;author=Colman+McCarthy&amp;desc=George+Seldes%3A+Giant+of+Journalism |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=July 11, 1995 |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nader said of Seldes, "He was like a doctor. He reported about disease in the political economy, and the gross inequities of power, and the abuses and the exploitation. I always wanted to be a crusading lawyer, and he gave me some materials to contemplate crusading about."&lt;ref name = "kovno1"/&gt; Journalist [[Nat Hentoff]] said, "He took what should be the most honorable term in journalism – muckraking – and made it work again. A lot of journalists of his generation and the generation or two that followed, did more, took risks, because [Seldes] was the model. And the fact that he was there made them feel like whores if they didn't do more."&lt;ref name = "kovno1" /&gt;

People such as [[Peggy Charren]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Children's Crusade Has a Happy Ending |first=Colman |last=McCarthy |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73987498.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jan+28%2C+1992&amp;author=COLMAN+McCARTHY&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=d.14&amp;desc=Children%27s+Crusade+Has+a+Happy+Ending |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=January 28, 1992 |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[I. F. Stone]]&lt;ref name=indobit /&gt; also claimed influence from Seldes.

'''Gregory Walter Graffin''' (born November 6, 1964) is an American [[punk rock]] singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, college lecturer, and author. He is most recognized as the lead vocalist, songwriter, and only constant member of the noted Los Angeles band [[Bad Religion]], which he co-founded in either 1979 or 1980. He also embarked on a solo career in 1997, when he released the album ''[[American Lesion]]''. His follow-up album, ''[[Cold as the Clay]]'' was released nine years later. Graffin obtained his PhD in the [[history of science]] at [[Cornell University]] and has lectured courses in [[natural sciences]] at both the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and at [[Cornell University]].

==Career with Bad Religion==
In 1979, at the age of 15, Greg Graffin and a few high school classmates formed Bad Religion in Southern California's [[San Fernando Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/news/?newsID=1837 |title=Report from Amsterdam 6/11/2010 &amp;#124; News from the front &amp;#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |publisher=Thebrpage.net |date= |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; After making a name for themselves in the Los Angeles punk scene, releasing two EPs and two full-length albums, they disbanded around 1985. However, Bad Religion reformed in 1986 with a new line-up, consisting of Graffin on vocals, [[Brett Gurewitz]] and [[Greg Hetson]] on guitars, [[Jay Bentley]] on bass, and [[Pete Finestone]] on drums. In 1988, they released ''[[Suffer (album)|Suffer]]'', which was a comeback for Bad Religion as well as a watershed for the Southern [[California punk]] sound popularized by guitarist Gurewitz's [[Epitaph Records]]. The reunion line-up made two more records before Finestone left the band in 1991.

Bad Religion has been known for its articulate and often politically charged lyrics as well as its fast-paced [[harmony]], [[melody]] and [[counterpoint]]. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's two main songwriters, though Graffin wrote the bulk of the material on his own for a three-album period in the late 1990s. Gurewitz had left the band in 1994 to concentrate on the future of Epitaph.

After a stint with major label [[Atlantic Records]] ended in the early 2000s, Bad Religion re-signed with Epitaph and Gurewitz rejoined. They have since continued to co-write songs and recorded five records: ''[[The Process of Belief]]'' (2002), ''[[The Empire Strikes First]]'' (2004), ''[[New Maps of Hell (Bad Religion album)|New Maps of Hell]]'' (2007), ''[[The Dissent of Man]]'' (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/news/?newsID=1840 |title=New album title revealed! |publisher=Thebrpage.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the latest, ''[[True North (album)|True North]]'' (2013).

==Solo career==
Graffin recorded a solo album in 1997, called ''[[American Lesion]]'', which consisted of softer, more pop-oriented folk songs. Most of this album was written during the breakup of his marriage, and the songs reflect this in lyrics and style.

In 2005, Graffin recorded his second solo album ''[[Cold as the Clay]].'' The album is an amalgamation of new songs by Graffin and 18th- and 19th-century American folk songs. It was produced by [[Brett Gurewitz]] and released on ANTI- Records on July 10, 2006.

In a September 2015 interview, Graffin revealed that he has been working on his third solo album, which will continue the folk style of his previous album ''Cold as the Clay''. His latest record, "Millport" was released on  March 10, 2017. It was co-written and produced by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion and features members of Social Distortion as backing musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/news/?newsID=2151 |title=New solo album Greg Graffin? |publisher=The Bad Religion Page |date=26 September 2015 |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==
Graffin attended [[El Camino Real High School]], then obtained both his bachelor's and master's at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). He went on to earn his PhD in the [[history of science]] from [[Cornell University]]. The PhD dissertation was supervised by [[William B. Provine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graffin|first=Greg|title=The Cornell Evolution Project |url=http://www.polypterus.com/|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of being out-of-print, the title of his dissertation changed to "Evolution and Religion: Questioning the Beliefs of the World's Eminent Evolutionists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=5077552 |title= Cornell University Library Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greg Graffin returned to UCLA where he taught natural science courses.&lt;ref name="Reading"&gt;{{cite web|last=Feinberg|first=Paul|title=Reading, Writing and Rock 'n' Roll|url=http://magazine.ucla.edu/exclusives/bad-religion_greg-graffin/|publisher=UCLA Magazine|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 2008 interview with Bad Religion bassist [[Jay Bentley]], he mentioned that Graffin would be teaching there from January to March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.punknews.org/article/29193 |title=Bad Religion looks ahead to 2009 album |publisher=Punknews.org|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, Graffin revealed that he would return to [[Cornell University]] that fall to co-teach for 14 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/news/?newsID=1913 |title=UPDATE: Bad Religion to be playing the Punk Rock Holiday Festival|publisher=Thebrpage.net |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work as an author and educator of naturalism and atheism==
Greg Graffin received the Rushdie Award for Cultural Humanism from the Harvard Humanist Chaplaincy in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greg Graffin (Bad Religion) talks about humanist award|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/28963|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greg Graffin's Lifetime Achievement Award Acceptance Speech|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5j9YxpGIPs|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2003, Graffin was engaged in an ongoing email discussion with Preston Jones, a historian at the Christian [[John Brown University]] in [[Arkansas]] and fan of Bad Religion.  The informal philosophical debate that resulted was published as a book titled ''Is Belief in God Good, Bad or Irrelevant? A Professor and Punk Rocker Discuss Science, Religion, Naturalism &amp; Christianity'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=tor on |url= http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/08/greg-graffin-punkrock-phd.html|title=Greg Graffin: Punk-Rock Ph.D.|publisher=Pastemagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/review/6278 |title=Preston Jones / Greg Graffin – Is Belief in God Good, Bad or Irrelevant?|publisher= Punknews.org|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Graffin announced that he had co-written a book with American author [[Steve Olson (writer)|Steve Olson]] titled ''Anarchy Evolution'', released on September 28, 2010 (the same day his band Bad Religion released their 15th album ''[[The Dissent of Man]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/news/?newsID=1618 |title=Graffins new book &amp;#124; News from the front &amp;#124; The Bad Religion Page – Since 1995 |publisher=Thebrpage.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Evolution|publisher=Amazon.ca |date=September 28, 2010 |id= {{ASIN|0061828505|country=ca}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Graffin writes that he is an [[atheism|atheist]]: "I’ve never believed in God, which technically makes me an atheist".&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Graffin, Greg &amp; Olson, Steve}}, Anarchy Evolution: Faith, Science, and Bad Religion in a World Without God. It Books, September 20, 2010. {{ISBN|978-0061828508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Graffin is not religious, he prefers to identify as a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] rather than as an atheist. "Naturalism is a belief system. A lot of scientists bristle at that. We all have to believe we can find the truth. Evidence is my guide. I rely on observation, experimentation and verification."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Electra|title=For punk rocker and professor, Greg Graffin, faith's in the fossil|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_16600583|publisher=[[The Denver Post]]|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also filmed and co-produced a television pilot called ''Punk Professor''. 

In 2010, he commented on the project, "It's sitting on someone's shelf waiting to be developed. I'm not actually pursuing it. I said, yeah, I'll shoot the pilot, then it's out of my hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaplinsky|first=Joshua|title=The Naturalistic Worldview of a Punk Rock Professor|url=http://chuckpalahniuk.net/interviews/musicians/greg-graffin-of-bad-religion|publisher=The Cult: The Official [[Chuck Palahniuk]] Website|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 2012, Bad Religion headlined the [[Reason Rally]] in Washington, D.C., where Graffin performed the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|U.S. national anthem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2012/03/reason-rally-bad-religion-washington-dc.html |title=Bad Religion in lineup for March 24 Reason Rally in Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Los Angeles Times |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Reason Rally Official Schedule|url=http://reasonrally.org/official-schedule/|accessdate=June 23, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617121719/http://reasonrally.org/official-schedule/|archivedate=June 17, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another book, entitled ''The Population Wars'', was released in September 2015. It had been in works since at least April 2011 and Graffin spoke about it to be "a bit more in depth about the process of evolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ithaca.com/entertainment/punk-rock-paleontologist-greg-graffin-pursues-music-and-science/article_f9ddc028-6b6f-11e0-be40-001cc4c002e0.html |title=Punk rock paleontologist: Greg Graffin pursues music and science|publisher= Ithaca Times|accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2015 interview with ''[[PopMatters]]'' [[journalist]] J.C. Maçek III for Graffin's book ''Population Wars'', Graffin stated "I’ve made a lot of mistakes, but you can’t dwell on mistakes because life is about an adventure. It’s about discovery. And you learn from your mistakes so unless you’re completely shut down to improving your life, I believe you can continue learning until you’re very, very old. You have to look at those past missteps as learning experiences."&lt;ref name=PM&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|author=Maçek III, J.C.|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/adventure-and-discovery-an-academic-discussion-with-bad-religions-greg-graf/|title=Adventure and Discovery, An Academic Discussion With Bad Religion's Greg Graffin|date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermann Klaus Hugo Weyl''', {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Foreign Member of the Royal Society|ForMemRS]]}}&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; ({{IPA-de|vaɪl|lang}}; 9 November 1885 – 8 December 1955) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]], [[theoretical physicist]] and [[philosopher]]. Although much of his working life was spent in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]] and then [[Princeton, New Jersey]], he is associated with the [[University of Göttingen]] tradition of mathematics, represented by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]].

His research has had major significance for [[theoretical physics]] as well as purely mathematical disciplines including [[number theory]]. He was one of the most influential mathematicians of the twentieth century, and an important member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] during its early years.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Weyl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=7373}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{worldcat id|id=lccn-n50-18035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weyl published technical and some general works on [[space]], [[time]], [[matter]], [[philosophy]], [[logic]], [[symmetry]] and the [[history of mathematics]]. He was one of the first to conceive of combining [[general relativity]] with the laws of [[electromagnetism]]. While no mathematician of his generation aspired to the 'universalism' of [[Henri Poincaré]] or Hilbert, Weyl came as close as anyone. [[Michael Atiyah]], in particular, has commented that whenever he examined a mathematical topic, he found that Weyl had preceded him.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Atiyah, ''[[The Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' (1984), vol. 6 no. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Weyl was born in [[Elmshorn]], a small town near [[Hamburg]], in [[Germany]], and attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] [[Christianeum]] in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bernd |last=Elsner |title=Die Abiturarbeit Hermann Weyls |journal=Christianeum |volume=63 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=3–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1904 to 1908 he studied mathematics and physics in both [[Göttingen]] and [[Munich]]. His doctorate was awarded at the [[University of Göttingen]] under the supervision of [[David Hilbert]] whom he greatly admired.

In September 1913 in Göttingen, Weyl married Friederike Bertha Helene Joseph (March 30, 1893&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matrikel.uzh.ch/active/static/28236.htm Universität Zũrich Matrikeledition]&lt;/ref&gt; – September 5, 1948&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/hermannweylf001] Hermann Weyl Collection (AR 3344) (Sys #000195637), Leo Baeck Institute, Center for Jewish History, 15 West 16th Street, New York, NY 10011. The collection includes a typewritten document titled "Hellas letzte Krankheit" ("Hella's Last Illness"); the last sentence on page 2 of the document states: "Hella starb am 5. September [1948], mittags 12 Uhr." ("Hella died at 12:00 Noon on September 5 [1948]"). Helene's funeral arrangements were handled by the M. A. Mather Funeral Home (now named the Mather-Hodge Funeral Home), located at 40 Vandeventer Avenue, Princeton, New Jersey. Helene Weyl was cremated on September 6, 1948 at the Ewing Cemetery &amp; Crematory, 78 Scotch Road, Trenton (Mercer County), New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;) who went by the name Helene (nickname "Hella"). Helene was a daughter of Dr. Bruno Joseph (December 13, 1861 – June 10, 1934), a physician who held the position of Sanitätsrat in Ribnitz-Damgarten, Germany. Helene was a philosopher (she was a disciple of phenomenologist [[Edmund Husserl]]) and also a translator of Spanish literature into German and English (especially the works of Spanish philosopher [[José Ortega y Gasset]]).&lt;ref&gt;For additional information on Helene Weyl, including a bibliography of her translations, published works, and manuscripts, see the following link: [http://digital.cjh.org/R/JVSF47K3SQLELY84UGG7YPFA37DG678XF613V1EL1lAVK8UXA2-03415?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=418384&amp;local_base=GEN01&amp;pds_handle=GUEST "In Memoriam Helene Weyl"] by Hermann Weyl. This document, which is one of the items in the Hermann Weyl Collection at the Leo Baeck Institute in New York City, was written by Hermann Weyl at the end of June 1948, about nine weeks before Helene died on September 5, 1948 in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. The first sentence in this document reads as follows: "Eine Skizze, nicht so sehr von Hellas, als von unserem gemeinsamen Leben, niedergeschrieben Ende Juni 1948." ("A sketch, not so much of Hella's life as of our common life, written at the end of June 1948.")&lt;/ref&gt;  It was through Helene's close connection with Husserl that Hermann became familiar with (and greatly influenced by) Husserl's thought. Hermann and Helene had two sons, [[Fritz Joachim Weyl]] (February 19, 1915 – July 20, 1977) and Michael Weyl (September 15, 1917 – March 19, 2011),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/michael-weyl-foreign-service-officer/2011/04/04/AFRUXBlC_story.html WashingtonPost.com]&lt;/ref&gt; both of whom were born in Zürich, Switzerland. Helene died in Princeton, New Jersey on September 5, 1948. A memorial service in her honor was held in Princeton on September 9, 1948. Speakers at her memorial service included her son Fritz Joachim Weyl and mathematicians [[Oswald Veblen]] and [[Richard Courant]].&lt;ref&gt;''In Memoriam Helene Weyl'' (1948) by Fritz Joachim Weyl. See: (i) http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/724142550 and (ii) http://d-nb.info/993224164&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 Hermann married sculptress Ellen Bär (née Lohnstein) (April 17, 1902 – July 14, 1988),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artist-finder.com/stuff/database/info_popup.php?menu=artist&amp;info=80111 artist-finder.com]&lt;/ref&gt; who was the widow of professor Richard Josef Bär (September 11, 1892 – December 15, 1940)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribalpages.com/tribe/familytree?uid=jeffreymarx&amp;surname=Baer Ellen Lohnstein and Richard Josef Bär were married on September 14, 1922 in Zürich, Switzerland.]&lt;/ref&gt; of Zürich.

After taking a teaching post for a few years, Weyl left Göttingen in 1913 for Zürich to take the chair of mathematics&lt;ref&gt;Weyl went to ETH Zürich in 1913 to fill the professorial chair vacated by the retirement of [[Carl Friedrich Geiser]].&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[ETH Zurich]], where he was a colleague of [[Albert Einstein]], who was working out the details of the theory of [[general relativity]]. Einstein had a lasting influence on Weyl, who became fascinated by mathematical physics. In 1921 Weyl met [[Erwin Schrödinger]], a theoretical physicist who at the time was a professor at the [[University of Zürich]]. They were to become close friends over time.  Weyl had some sort of childless love affair with Erwin's wife Annemarie (Anny) Schrödinger (née Bertel) (December 31, 1896 – October 3, 1965),&lt;ref&gt;In a photo&lt;!--File:Grave_Schroedinger_(detail).png--&gt; of Erwin and Annemarie Schrödinger's combined gravemarker in Alpbacher Friedhof (Alpbach Cemetery) located in Alpbach, Kufstein District, Tirol, Austria, the gravemarker gives Annemarie's birthdate as December 31, 1896 — not December 3, 1896 as is mistakenly reported on numerous internet websites — and her deathdate as October 3, 1965. Annemarie's maiden surname was Bertel. Born in [[Salzburg]], Austria, Annemarie was a daughter of Eduard Bertel (1856 – after 1914), a prosperous photographer (court photographer), actor, and industrialist whose various businesses were headquartered in Salzburg. However, it is reported that Eduard moved to Vienna about 1909 or 1910. Annemarie's mother is believed to have been an illegitimate daughter of Georg Junger (1831-1908), a famous and wealthy Salzburg businessman who in 1858 founded a firm of wholesale merchants (selling fashion accessories) located in the ''Altermarkt'' section of Salzburg. Annemarie had an older brother named Erich Bertel and a younger sister named Irmgard Bertel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geni.com/people/Erwin-Schr%C3%B6dinger/6000000000469927083] Biographical information on Annemarie Schrödinger (née Bertel): Annemarie's birthdate is given as December 3, 1896 on this website, which very likely is wrong since her birthdate as given on her gravemarker in the Alpbach Cemetery is December 31, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; while at the same time Anny was helping raise an illegitimate daughter of Erwin's named Ruth Georgie Erica March, who was born in 1934 in [[Oxford]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Moore |title=Schrödinger: Life and Thought |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-521-43767-9 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=m-YF1g1KWLoC |page=175 }} |pages=175–176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/QVQC-RNQH] Ruth Georgie Erica March was born on May 30, 1934 in Oxford, England, but—according to the records presented here—it appears that her birth wasn't "registered" with the British authorities until the 3rd registration quarter (the July–August–September quarter) of the year 1934. Ruth's actual, biological father was Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961), and her mother was Hildegunde March (née Holzhammer) (born 1900), wife of Austrian physicist [[Arthur March]] (February 23, 1891 – April 17, 1957). Hildegunde's friends often called her "Hilde" or "Hilda" rather than Hildegunde. Arthur March was Erwin Schrödinger's assistant at the time of Ruth's birth. The reason Ruth's surname is March (instead of Schrödinger) is because Arthur had agreed to be named as Ruth's father on her birth certificate, even though he wasn't her biological father. Ruth married the engineer Arnulf Braunizer in May 1956, and they have lived in Alpbach, Austria for many years. Ruth has been very active as the sole administrator of the intellectual (and other) property of her father Erwin's estate, which she manages from Alpbach.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weyl was a Plenary Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) in 1928 at [[Bologna]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atti del Congresso internazionale dei Matematici, Bologna, 1928|volume=Tomo I|pages=233–246|location=Bologna|publisher=N.

Weyl|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzMKd3IlqswC&amp;pg=PA189}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1936 at [[Oslo]]. For the academic year 1928–1929 he was a visiting professor at [[Princeton University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shenstone, Allen G.|authorlink=Allen Shenstone|title=Princeton &amp; Physics|date=24 February 1961|journal=Princeton Alumni Weekly|volume=61|pages= 7–8 of article on pp. 6–13 &amp; p. 20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8hJbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA363}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote a paper with [[Howard P. Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On a problem in the theory of groups arising in the foundations of infinitesimal geometry|author=Robertson, H. P.|author2=Weyl, H.|journal=Bull. Amer.

Weyl left Zürich in 1930 to become Hilbert's successor at Göttingen, leaving when the Nazis assumed power in 1933, particularly as his wife was Jewish. He had been offered one of the first faculty positions at the new [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], but had declined because he did not desire to leave his homeland. As the political situation in Germany grew worse, he changed his mind and accepted when offered the position again. He remained there until his retirement in 1951. Together with his second wife Ellen, he spent his time in Princeton and Zürich, and died from a heart attack on December 8, 1955 while living in Zürich.

Hermann Weyl was cremated in Zurich on December 12, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;''137: Jung, Pauli, and the Pursuit of a Scientific Obsession'' (New York and London: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009), by Arthur I. Miller (p. 228).&lt;/ref&gt; His cremains remained in private hands until 1999, at which time they were interred in an outdoor columbarium vault in the Princeton Cemetery&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/60572577 findagrave.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Weyl's cremains (ashes) are interred in an outdoor columbarium vault in the Princeton Cemetery at this location: Section 3, Block 04, Lot C1, Grave B15.&lt;/ref&gt; (aka the Princeton Cemetery of Nassau Presbyterian Church),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=cr&amp;GRid=60572577&amp;CRid=100174&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; located at 29 Greenview Avenue, Princeton (Mercer County), New Jersey. The remains of Hermann's son Michael Weyl (1917–2011) are interred right next to Hermann's ashes in the same columbarium vault in the Princeton Cemetery.

Weyl was a [[pantheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mind and Nature: Selected Writings on Philosophy, Mathematics, and Physics|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691135458|author1=Hermann Weyl |author2=Peter Pesic |editor=Peter Pesic|page=12|quote=To use the apt phrase of his son Michael, 'The Open World' (1932) contains "Hermann's dialogues with God" because here the mathematician confronts his ultimate concerns. These do not fall into the traditional religious traditions but are much closer in spirit to Spinoza's rational analysis of what he called "God or nature," so important for Einstein as well. ...In the end, Weyl concludes that this God "cannot and will not be comprehended" by the human mind, even though "mind is freedom within the limitations of existence; it is open toward the infinite." Nevertheless, "neither can God penetrate into man by revelation, nor man penetrate to him by mystical perception."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution of eigenvalues===
{{further|Weyl law|Weyl law#Weyl conjecture}}

In 1911  Weyl published ''Über die asymptotische Verteilung der Eigenwerte'' (''On the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues'') in which he proved that the eigenvalues of the Laplacian in the compact domain are distributed according to the so-called [[Weyl law]]. In 1912 he suggested a new proof, based on variational principles. Weyl returned to this topic several times, considered elasticity system and formulated the [[Weyl law#Weyl conjecture|Weyl conjecture]]. These works started an important domain—[[asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues]]—of modern analysis.

===Geometric foundations of manifolds and physics===
{{further|Weyl transformation|Weyl tensor}}

In 1913, Weyl published ''Die Idee der Riemannschen Fläche'' (''The Concept of a Riemann Surface''), which gave a unified treatment of [[Riemann surface]]s. In it Weyl utilized [[point set topology]], in order to make Riemann surface theory more rigorous, a model followed in later work on [[manifold]]s. He absorbed [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|L. E. J. Brouwer's]] early work in topology for this purpose.

Weyl, as a major figure in the Göttingen school, was fully apprised of Einstein's work from its early days. He tracked the development of [[general relativity|relativity]] physics in his ''Raum, Zeit, Materie'' (''Space, Time, Matter'') from 1918, reaching a 4th edition in 1922. In 1918, he introduced the notion of [[Gauge (mathematics)|gauge]], and gave the first example of what is now known as a [[gauge theory]]. Weyl's gauge theory was an unsuccessful attempt to model the [[electromagnetic field]] and the [[gravitational field]] as geometrical properties of [[spacetime]]. The Weyl tensor in [[Riemannian geometry]] is of major importance in understanding the nature of conformal geometry.  In 1929, Weyl introduced the concept of the [[Cartan connection applications|vierbein]] into general relativity.&lt;ref&gt;1929. "Elektron und Gravitation I", ''Zeitschrift Physik'', 56, pp 330–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

His overall approach in physics was based on the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] philosophy of [[Edmund Husserl]], specifically Husserl's 1913 ''Ideen zu einer reinen Phänomenologie und phänomenologischen Philosophie. Erstes Buch: Allgemeine Einführung in die reine Phänomenologie '' (Ideas of a Pure Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy. First Book: General Introduction). Husserl had reacted strongly to [[Gottlob Frege]]'s criticism of his first work on the philosophy of arithmetic and was investigating the sense of mathematical and other structures, which Frege had distinguished from empirical reference.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Topological groups, Lie groups and representation theory===
{{main|Peter–Weyl theorem|Weyl group|Weyl spinor|Weyl algebra}}

From 1923 to 1938, Weyl developed the theory of [[compact group]]s, in terms of [[Representation theory|matrix representation]]s. In the [[compact Lie group]] case he proved a fundamental [[Weyl's character formula|character formula]].

These results are foundational in understanding the symmetry structure of [[quantum mechanics]], which he put on a group-theoretic basis. This included [[spinor]]s. Together with the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], in large measure due to [[John von Neumann]], this gave the treatment familiar since about 1930. Non-compact groups and their representations, particularly the [[Heisenberg group]], were also streamlined in that specific context, in  his 1927 [[Weyl quantization]], the best extant bridge between
classical and quantum physics to date. From this time, and certainly much helped by Weyl's expositions, Lie groups and [[Lie algebra]]s became a mainstream part both of [[pure mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]].

His book ''[[The Classical Groups]]'' reconsidered [[invariant theory]]. It covered [[symmetric group]]s, [[general linear group]]s, [[orthogonal group]]s, and [[symplectic group]]s and results on their [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] and [[group representation|representations]].

===Harmonic analysis and analytic number theory===
{{details|Weyl's criterion}}
Weyl also showed how to use [[exponential sum]]s in [[diophantine approximation]], with his criterion for [[equidistributed mod 1|uniform distribution mod 1]], which was a fundamental step in [[analytic number theory]]. This work applied to the [[Riemann zeta function]], as well as [[additive number theory]]. It was developed by many others.

===Foundations of mathematics===
In ''The Continuum'' Weyl developed the logic of [[impredicativity|predicative analysis]] using the lower levels of [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[ramified theory of types]]. He was able to develop most of classical calculus, while using neither the [[axiom of choice]] nor [[proof by contradiction]], and avoiding [[Georg Cantor]]'s [[infinite set]]s. Weyl appealed in this period to the radical constructivism of the German romantic, subjective idealist [[Fichte]].

Shortly after publishing ''The Continuum'' Weyl briefly shifted his position wholly to the [[intuitionism]] of Brouwer. In ''The Continuum'', the constructible points exist as discrete entities. Weyl wanted a [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]] that was not an aggregate of points. He wrote a controversial article proclaiming that, for himself and L. E. J. Brouwer, "We are the revolution." This article was far more influential in propagating intuitionistic views than the original works of Brouwer himself.

[[George Pólya]] and Weyl, during a mathematicians' gathering in Zürich (9 February 1918), made a bet concerning the future direction of mathematics. Weyl predicted that in the subsequent 20 years, mathematicians would come to realize the total vagueness of notions such as [[real number]]s, [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], and [[countable|countability]], and moreover, that asking about the [[truth]] or falsity of the [[least upper bound]] [[Property (philosophy)|property]] of the real numbers was as meaningful as asking about truth of the basic assertions of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] on the philosophy of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich, Yuri. [http://research.microsoft.com/~gurevich/Opera/123.pdf "Platonism, Constructivism and Computer Proofs vs Proofs by Hand"], ''Bulletin of the European Association of Theoretical Computer Science'', 1995. This paper describes a letter discovered by Gurevich in 1995 that documents the bet. It is said that when the friendly bet ended, the individuals gathered cited Pólya as the victor (with [[Kurt Gödel]] not in concurrence).&lt;/ref&gt; Any answer to such a question would be unverifiable, unrelated to experience,  and therefore senseless.

However, within a few years Weyl decided that Brouwer's intuitionism did put too great restrictions on mathematics, as critics had always said. The "Crisis" article had disturbed Weyl's [[formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] teacher Hilbert, but later in the 1920s Weyl partially reconciled his position with that of Hilbert.

After about 1928 Weyl had apparently decided that mathematical intuitionism was not compatible with his enthusiasm for the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] philosophy of [[Husserl]], as he had apparently earlier thought. In the last decades of his life Weyl emphasized mathematics as  "symbolic construction" and moved to a position closer not only to Hilbert but to that of [[Ernst Cassirer]]. Weyl however rarely refers to Cassirer, and wrote only brief articles and passages articulating this position.

By 1949, Weyl was thoroughly disillusioned with the ultimate value of intuitionism, and wrote: "Mathematics with Brouwer gains its highest intuitive clarity. He succeeds in developing the beginnings of analysis in a natural manner, all the time preserving the contact with intuition much more closely than had been done before. It cannot be denied, however, that in advancing to higher and more general theories the inapplicability of the simple laws of classical logic eventually results in an almost unbearable awkwardness. And the mathematician watches with pain the greater part of his towering edifice which he believed to be built of concrete blocks dissolve into mist before his eyes."

===Weyl fermions===
{{main|Weyl fermion}}
In 1929, Weyl proposed a fermion for use in a replacement theory for relativity. This fermion would be a massless [[quasiparticle]] and carry electric charge. An electron could be split into two Weyl fermions or formed from two Weyl fermions. [[Neutrino]]s were once thought to be Weyl fermions, but they are now known to have mass. Weyl fermions are sought after for electronics applications to solve some problems that electrons present. Such quasiparticles were discovered in 2015, in a form of crystals known as [[Weyl semimetal]]s, a type of topological material.&lt;ref name=I3Espectrum-2015-07-16&gt;{{cite news |url= http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/materials/exotic-particles-could-lead-to-faster-electronics |title= Weyl Fermions Found, a Quasiparticle That Acts Like a Massless Electron |author= Charles Q.

'''Holden Caulfield''' is a fictional character in author [[J. D. Salinger]]'s 1951 novel ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''. Since the book's publication, Holden has become an icon for teenage [[rebellion]] and [[angst]], and now stands among the most important characters of 20th-century American literature. The name Holden Caulfield was used in an unpublished short story written in 1942 and first appeared in print in 1945.

Although it has been conjectured that J. D. Salinger got the name for Holden Caulfield in ''The Catcher in the Rye'' when he saw a marquee for the 1947 film ''[[Dear Ruth (film)|Dear Ruth]]'', starring [[William Holden]] and [[Joan Caulfield]],&lt;ref&gt;Saturday Evening Post, July 15, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; Salinger's first Holden Caulfield story, "[[I'm Crazy]]," appeared in ''[[Collier's]]'' on December 22, 1945, a year and a half before this movie was released.

==Explanation of teenage narrative==
Holden is naive and at the same time resentful of the adult world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/literature/catcher-in-the-rye/character-analysis/holden-caufield.html Cliffs Notes: The Catcher in the Rye - Character Analysis: Holden Caulfield. Accessed 15 February 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217165614/http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/literature/catcher-in-the-rye/character-analysis/holden-caufield.html |date=17 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Holden's most striking and quintessential qualities is his powerful revulsion for "phony" qualities, a catch-all term for the perceived hypocrisy that irritates Holden. It is this [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] that causes him to distance himself from other people, despite wanting connection as well. Holden is very much a character of contradiction; at seventeen years of age he is six feet two-and-a-half inches (189&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, and already has some grey hair – though he himself admits that he sometimes acts more like a 13-year-old than an adult. He continually fails classes, yet is thought of as a "hot shot" by his English teacher, with an obvious flair for writing.

==In ''The Catcher in the Rye''==
Holden Caulfield is the narrator and main character of ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''. The novel recounts Holden's week in New York City during [[school holiday|Christmas break]] following his expulsion from Pencey Prep, a preparatory school in [[Pennsylvania]] based loosely on Salinger's alma mater [[Valley Forge Military Academy]]. Holden Caulfield tells his story with surprising honesty from a hospital in California in a cynical and jaded language.

==In other works==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
The character, as Holden Morrisey Caulfield, appears in Salinger's "[[Slight Rebellion off Madison]]", published in the December 21, 1946, issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''. An earlier version of this story, titled "Are You Banging Your Head Against a Wall?" was accepted for publication by ''The New Yorker'' in October 1941, but was not published then because editors found the tone to be too desolate for its readership. An edited version of this short story later became the basis of several chapters in the middle-late section of ''The Catcher in the Rye'' dealing with Caulfield's date with Sally Hayes, during which he confesses his desire to run away with her, meets Carl Luce for drinks, and makes a drunken phone call to the Hayes' home. Unlike the similar sequence in the novel, Caulfield is on a [[Christmas]] break from school, and, in the story, the interlude with Sally is split into two occurrences. Also, the meeting with Carl Luce is considerably briefer in the story than in the novel.

Caulfield also figures as a character in the short story "[[I'm Crazy]]", published in ''Colliers'' (December 22, 1945), and other members of the Caulfield family are featured in "[[Last Day of the Last Furlough]]", published in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' (July 15, 1944) and the unpublished short stories "[[The Last and Best of the Peter Pans]]" (c. 1942) and "[[The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls]]" (c. 1945). "I'm Crazy" is closely related to the first chapter of ''The Catcher in the Rye''. It begins with Caulfield standing on a hill at "Pencey Prep" watching a football game below, and develops as Holden visits with his history teacher, Mr. Spencer, for a talk about his expulsion from school and his future. Several other details match those found in the first chapter of ''Catcher'', including a reference to the mother of one of Caulfield's schoolmates and to his own mother sending him a gift of ice skates, but the story ends with his returning home instead of running away from school. Once home, he is not shown confronting his parents, who, according to the maid, are playing bridge. Instead, he goes to speak to Phoebe. Their dialogue is similar to that which appears in the later chapters of ''The Catcher in the Rye''. The other notable feature of the story is that his sister Viola gets her first, and only, mention in the Caulfield saga.

"[[This Sandwich Has No Mayonnaise]]" (''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', 1945) has a mention of Holden missing in action during the war.

==Caulfield family in other works==

"Last Day of the Last Furlough" relates the final day of Babe Gladwaller before he leaves to fight in [[World War II]]. Gladwaller spends part of the day with his little sister before Vincent Caulfield (later renamed D.B. in the novel) arrives. At that point Vincent is a fellow soldier about to leave for the war. Vincent announces that his brother, Holden, has been declared missing in action. Gladwaller's relationship with his younger sister can be seen as a parallel to Caulfield's relationship with Phoebe.

"The Last and Best of the Peter Pans" relates the story of Vincent's (D.B.) [[conscription|draft]] questionnaire being hidden by his mother. The events occur just after the death of Kenneth (later renamed Allie) and reveal the anxiety of Mary Moriarity, an actress and Caulfield's mother. The story is notable for the appearance of Phoebe and Vincent's statements about a child crawling off a cliff.

In "The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls," Vincent (D.B.) recalls the day his brother Kenneth (Allie) died. The story is set at the Caulfield summer home on [[Cape Cod]]. Several details make their way from this story into ''Catcher'', including the characterization of Allie; Allie's poetry-inscribed left-handed baseball mitt; Vincent's girlfriend, Helen, who keeps her kings in the back row (like Jane Gallagher); and Caulfield's critical view of others. While the cause of death in ''Catcher'' is [[leukemia]], here it is due to an unspecified heart condition. Toward the end of the story, Kenneth and Vincent are on the beach. Kenneth decides to go swimming and is knocked out by a wave. Holden, just home from camp, is waiting on the porch with his suitcases as Vincent comes back with Kenneth's unconscious body. Kenneth dies later the same night. The story was reportedly sold to a magazine, only to be taken back by Salinger before publication.

Another short story of note with relationship to Caulfield is "The Boy in the People Shooting Hat," which was submitted to ''The New Yorker'' sometime between 1948 and 1949 but was never published. It focuses on a fight between two characters named Bobby and Stradlater over Bobby's feelings about Jane Gallagher. This story appears to form the basis for several key scenes in the first several chapters of ''The Catcher in the Rye''.

In ''[[Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction#Seymour: An Introduction|Seymour: An Introduction]]'' a Curtis Caulfield is mentioned in passing as "an exceptionally intelligent and likable boy" who appeared on the same radio show as Seymour and the other [[Glass family|Glass children]]. He is reportedly "killed during one of the landings in the Pacific."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salinger|first=J.D.|title=Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters ; and Seymour : an introduction|year=2001|publisher=Back Bay books|location=Boston|isbn=0-316-76694-1|pages=225|edition=1st Back Bay pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
Holden Caulfield is one of the most enduring characters in 20th-century American fiction. It has been suggested that Salinger himself related so closely to Holden that he was protective of the character. This was the reason he was unwilling to allow filming of the book or use of the character by other writers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2012/10/everybody-still-wants-piece-holden-caulfield/58012/ "Holden Caulfield, It's Time We Let Go", ''Atlantic Wire'', October 16, 2012. Accessed 15 February 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Catcher in the Rye'' is required reading in many high school English courses, although it has been [[banned books|banned]] from some school libraries by parent and teacher groups opposed to its use of profanity and perceived glorification of rebellion.

The term '''Holy Guardian Angel''' ('''HGA''') originates in the Catholic Church where a morning prayer is recited which reads, "Holy Guardian Angel whom God has appointed to be my guardian,
direct and govern me during this day/ Amen". The idea of a Holy Guardian Angel is central to the book, "The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra Melin the Mage", [[Abramelin the Mage|Abraham of Worms]], a German Cabalist who wrote the book on [[ceremonial magick]] during the 15th century which was later translated by [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]], the founder of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. He elaborated on this earlier work, giving it extensive magical notes, but the original concept goes back to the Zoroastrian Arda Fravaš ('Holy Guardian Angels').{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In Mathers' publication of ''[[The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage]]'', he writes: 

:"If thou shalt perfectly observe these rules, all the following Symbols and an infinitude of others will be granted unto thee by thy Holy Guardian Angel; thou thus living for the Honour and Glory of the True and only God, for thine own good, and that of thy neighbour. Let the Fear of God be ever before the eyes and the heart of him who shall possess this Divine Wisdom and Sacred Magic."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers|MacGregor Mathers, S. L.]]. ''[[The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage]]''. Book Tree. {{ISBN|1-58509-252-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, author and [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] popularized the term within his religious and philosophical system of [[Thelema]].

==Aleister Crowley's teachings==
{{Thelema}}
Within the system of the magical Order [[A∴A∴]] founded by [[Aleister Crowley]], one of the two most important goals is to consciously connect with one’s Holy Guardian Angel, representative of one's truest [[divinity|divine]] nature: a process termed “Knowledge and Conversation.”

:It should never be forgotten for a single moment that the central and essential work of the Magician is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Once he has achieved this he must of course be left entirely in the hands of that Angel, who can be invariably and inevitably relied upon to lead him to the further great step—crossing of the [[Abyss (Thelema)|Abyss]] and the attainment of the grade of Master of the Temple.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley,Magic Without Tears, Ch.83&lt;/ref&gt;

In some branches of occultism, the term is so widely known that HGA has become a common abbreviation even in non-English-speaking countries.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Crowley seems to consider it equivalent to the Genius of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], the [[Augoeides]] of [[Iamblichus]], the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] of [[Hinduism]], and the [[Daemon (mythology)|Daemon]] of the [[ancient Greeks]]. He borrowed the term from the [[Grimoire]] "[[The Book of Abramelin|The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage]]".{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Even though the Holy Guardian Angel is, in a sense, the “higher self”, it is often experienced as a separate being, independent from the adept.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Methods of achieving knowledge and conversation ===
Crowley said that the Abramelin procedure was not the only way to achieve success in this endeavour: 

:It is impossible to lay down precise rules by which a man may attain to the knowledge and conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel; for that is the particular secret of each one of us; a secret not to be told or even divined by any other, whatever his grade. It is the Holy of Holies, whereof each man is his own High Priest, and none knoweth the Name of his brother's God, or the Rite that invokes Him.&lt;ref&gt;Book 4, "One Star in Sight"&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the operation described in “Abramelin” is so complex and requires time and resources not available to most people, Crowley wanted to provide a more accessible method. While at the [[Abbey of Thelema]] in Italy, he wrote ''Liber Samekh''&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''[http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib800.html Liber Samekh]''.&lt;/ref&gt; based on the [[Bornless Ritual]], a ritual designed as an example of how one may attain the Knowledge and Conversation with one’s Holy Guardian Angel. In his notes to this ritual, Crowley sums up the key to success: “INVOKE OFTEN.”

Crowley also explains, in more detail, the general mystical process of the ritual:

:The Adept will be free to concentrate his deepest self, that part of him which unconsciously orders his true Will, upon the realization of his Holy Guardian Angel. The absence of his bodily, mental and astral consciousness is indeed cardinal to success, for it is their usurpation of his attention which has made him deaf to his Soul, and his preoccupation with their affairs that has prevented him from perceiving that Soul.

:The effect of the Ritual has been

:# to keep them so busy with their own work that they cease to distract him;
:# to separate them so completely that his soul is stripped of its sheaths;
:# to arouse in him an enthusiasm so intense as to intoxicate and anaesthetize him, that he may not feel and resent the agony of this spiritual vivisection, just as bashful lovers get drunk on the wedding night, in order to brazen out the intensity of shame which so mysteriously coexists with their desire;
:# to concentrate the necessary spiritual forces from every element, and fling them simultaneously into the aspiration towards the Holy Guardian Angel; and
:# to attract the Angel by the vibration of the magical voice which invokes Him.

:The method of the Ritual is thus manifold.

Another detailed description of the general operation is given in ''The Vision and the Voice'' in the eighth Aethyr and is also described in ''Liber 8''.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''[http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib8.html Liber 8]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variations in Crowley's teachings ===
Crowley only states that the Holy Guardian Angel is the 'silent self' in his early life. In his late sixties, when composing ''[[Magick Without Tears]]'', he states something very different. According to Crowley's later definition, the Holy Guardian Angel is not one's 'self', but an independent and discrete being, who may have been a human like oneself at one stage:

:Now, on the other hand, there is an entirely different type of angel; and here we must be especially careful to remember that we include gods and devils, for there are such beings who are not by any means dependent on one particular element for their existence.  They are microcosms in exactly the same sense as men and women are.  They are individuals who have picked up the elements of their composition as possibility and convenience dictates, exactly as we do ourselves... I believe that the Holy Guardian Angel is a Being of this order.  He is something more than a man, possibly a being who has already passed through the stage of humanity, and his peculiarly intimate relationship with his client is that of friendship, of community, of brotherhood, or Fatherhood.  He is not, let me say with emphasis, a mere abstraction from yourself; and that is why I have insisted rather heavily that the term 'Higher Self' implies a damnable heresy and a dangerous delusion."&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Magick Without Tears&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that the HGA is an independent, spiritual being, rather than a manifestation of the Self, has led to uneasiness in some circles that the doctrine is a disguised form of [[diabolism]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== Peter Carroll's teachings==

An occult writer, [[Peter J. Carroll|Peter Carroll]] split the concept in two and speaks of two "Holy Guardian Angels". According to his work ''Liber Null and Psychonaut'', one is the Augoeides,&lt;ref&gt;Caroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null and Psychonaut''. pp. 49-51&lt;/ref&gt; a projected image of whatever the magician strives for, and the other is [[Uncertainty principle|quantum uncertainty]], which ultimately determines the acts of the magician and is a spark of the only true creative force, the chaos of [[Chaos magic]].

==C.F. Russell's teachings==
American author [[C.F. Russell]] was the founder of an occult group called the G.B.G.   The G.B.G. taught the use of "Dianism", a sex magick ritual in which a participant is to regard their partner as a representation of their Holy Guardian Angel.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=yFs3qoTFVz8C&amp;pg=PA127&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enochian teachings ==
The [[Enochian magic|Enochian system]] of 16th Century occultist Dr. [[John Dee]] offers a concept similar to Crowley's later teachings with regard to the Holy Guardian Angel. It is more in concord with traditional teachings of the HGA as a messenger of God and one of His angels (critics of Crowley's system said it was open to the interpretation of the HGA being either a fallen angel (demon) or a lost, or damned, human soul).

In this dialog between Dee and the angel Jubanladace on p.&amp;nbsp;18, Cotton Appendix XLVI 1, the angel says the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Dee:''' If I should not offend you, I would gladly know of what order you are or how your state is in respect of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Gabriel]], [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] or [[Uriel]].&lt;br&gt;

'''Jubanladace:''' Unto men, according unto their deserts, and the first excellency of their soul, God hath appointed a good Governor or Angel, from among the orders of those that are blessed.  For every soul that is good, is not of one and the self same dignification.  Therefore according to his excellency we are appointed as Ministers from that order, whereunto his excellency accordeth: to the intent that he may be brought, at last, to supply those places which were glorified by a former: and also to the intent, that the Prince of darkness might be counterposed in God's justice.&lt;ref&gt;Now in various collections of the British Library. See especially Sloane MSS 3188, 3189 and 3191, and Cotton Appendix XLVI.

==Biography==
Ibn al-Muqaffa, though a resident of [[Basra]], was originally from the town of Goor (or Gur, [[Firuzabad, Fars]]) in the [[Iran]]ian province of [[Fars Province|Fars]] and was born to a family of local notables. His father had been a state official in charge of taxes under the [[Umayyads]], and after being accused and convicted of embezzling some of the money entrusted to him, was punished by the ruler by having his hand crushed, hence the name ''Muqaffa'' (shrivelled hand). Ibn al-Muqaffa served in sectarial posts under the Umayyad governors of [[Gundeshapur|Shapur]] and [[Kirman (Sasanian province)|Kirman]]. Unlike his other colleagues, he escaped persecution at the hands of [[Abbasids]] after their overthrow of the Umayyad dynasty. He later returned to Basra and served as a secretary under Isa ibn Ali and Sulayman ibn Ali, the uncles of the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mansur]]. After their brother [[Abdallah ibn Ali]] made an abortive bid for the throne, they asked Ibn al-Muqaffa to write a letter to the Caliph to not  retaliate against his uncle and pardon him. The language of the letter offended al-Mansur, who wished to be rid of Ibn al-Muqaffa. He was executed around 756 or 759 AD by the governor of Basra. A defense of [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] dualism and a few lines of prose written in imitation of the [[Quran]] have been ascribed to him. Whether authentic or not, and despite his conversion to Islam, these texts contributed to his posthumous reputation as a heretic.&lt;ref&gt;Said Amir Arjomand, "`Abd Allah Ibn al-Muqaffa` and the `Abbasid Revolution," ''Iranian Studies,'' 27:33 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H-k9oc9xsuAC&amp;pg=PA346&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwA2oVChMI6IaN1JfNxgIVigaOCh2fSATH#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|author= Josef W.

==Literary career==
Ibn al-Muqaffa's translation of the ''[[Panchatantra|Kalīla wa Dimna]]'' from [[Middle Persian]] is considered the first masterpiece of [[Arabic literature|Arabic literary prose]]. "Ibn al-Muqaffa' was a pioneer in the introduction of literary prose narrative to [[Arabic literature]]. He paved the way for later innovators such as [[Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani|al-Hamadani]] and [[al-Saraqusti]], who brought literary fiction to Arabic literature by adapting traditionally accepted modes of oral narrative transmission into literary prose."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=none|last=Wacks|first=David A.|journal=Journal of Arabic Literature|volume=34|issue=1-2|year=&lt;!-- April--&gt;2003|pages=178–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn al-Muqaffa was also an accomplished scholar of [[Middle Persian]], and was the author of several moral fables.

==Works==

=== Translations and adaptations ===

'''''[[Panchatantra|Kalīla wa Dimna]]''''' : His translation of a Middle Persian collection of animal fables, mostly of Indian origin, involving two jackals, Kalīla and Demna. The Middle Persian original, now lost but thought have been entitled ''Karīrak ud Damanak'' was written by one [[Borzuya|Borzōē/Borzūya]], a Persian physician attached to the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] court in the 6th century. Prefaced by a putative autobiography of Borzūya and an account of his voyage to [[Indian subcontinent|India]], the full work was done into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa', who introduced it with a prologue of his own and may have been responsible for four added stories. From Ibn al-Moqaffaʿ’s Arabic rendering of Borzūya’s work are descended not only all later Arabic versions of Kalīla wa Dimna, but also one of two [[Syriac language|Syriac]] versions (the other one is pre-Islamic ) and the medieval [[Greek language|Greek]], Persian (6th/12th century), [[Hebrew]], [[Latin]], and [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]] versions. Though there are many Arabic manuscripts of Kalīla wa Dimna, Ibn al-Muqaffa'’s version is not among them, and the oldest dated copy was written almost five centuries after his death. That he aimed at an idiomatic rather than a slavishly literal rendering is generally agreed, and all indications are that he achieved clarity of expression by simplicity of diction and plain syntactical structures. As no medieval Arab critic seems to have impugned his style, it was evidently pleasing and well suited to the taste of his Arab readers.&lt;ref name=RoozbehLatham&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Latham |first=J. Derek | title= EBN AL-MOQAFFAʿ, ABŪ MOḤAMMAD ʿABD-ALLĀH RŌZBEH | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=2012-01-28|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ebn-al-moqaffa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn al-Muqaffa'’s translation of Kalīla wa Dimna was not a conscious attempt to start a new literary trend; it was clearly just one of several works of old Sasanian court literature which Ibn al-Muqaffa' introduced to an exclusive readership within court circles, its function being to illustrate what should or should not be done by those aiming at political and social success. Kalīla wa Dimna, nonetheless, served as a stimulus to the development of Arabic prose literature and inspired imitators, artists, and poets. A prose Persian translation of the Arabic text was available as early as the 10th century, of which a versified version was made by [[Rudaki]] (d.941-42). Both versions are lost except for a few lines of Rūdakī’s poem preserved in other sources. A later prose translation was rendered by Abu’l-Maʿālī Nasr-Allāh Ibn Mohammad Shirazi and dedicated to the [[Ghaznavid]] [[Ghaznavid#Sultan Bahram Shah|Bahramshah]].

'''''[[Khwaday-Namag]]''''': Ibn al-Muqaffa' is thought to have produced an Arabic adaptation of the late Sasanian Khwaday-Namag, a chronicle of pre-Islamic Persian kings, princes, and warriors. A mixture of legend, myth, and fact, it served as a quasi-national history inspired by a vision of kingship as a well-ordered autocracy with a sacred duty to rule and to regulate its subjects’ conduct within a rigid class system. Interspersed with maxims characteristic of ''andarz'' literature, the narrative also offered practical advice on civil and military matters. Ibn al-Muqaffa' is known to have modified certain parts of the original and excluded others, possibly to make it intelligible to his Arab Muslim readers. He is thought to have inserted an account of [[Mazdak]], from which later Perso-Arab historians derived much of their knowledge of the [[Mazdak#Mazdakism|Mazdakite movement]]. Like its Middle Persian original, Ibn al-Muqaffa'’s Arabic version is not extant. The ''Oyun al-akhbar'' and the ''Ketab al-maʿaref'' of [[Ibn Qutaybah|Ibn Qutayba]] (d. 889) may preserve fragments of it; certainly the ''Sīar al-ʿAjam'', quoted by Ibn Qutayba without ascription, renders the Khwaday-Namag.&lt;ref name="RoozbehLatham" /&gt;

'''''Other books''''': [[Ibn al-Nadim]] attributes several other Arabic translations of Middle Persian works to Ibn al-Muqaffa', namely '''Āʾīn-nāma''', '''Kitāb al-tāj''', and '''Kitāb Mazdak'''. Ibn Qutayba is thought to have preserved parts of the Āʾīn-nāma, for in his Oyun a number of passages are quoted, albeit without ascription, with the opening words ''I have read in the Aiin (or Kitāb al-āʾīn)''. The quotations bear on topics such as court manners and customs, military tactics, [[divination]] and [[physiognomy]], archery, and [[polo]], subjects typical of various works on Sasanian institutions, protocol, entertainment, general savoir faire, and so on. Also in the Oyun are extracts from a Kitāb al-tāj . Ebn al-Nadim describes this book as a biography of [[Khosrow I|Khosrau I (Anoshirvan)]], but Ibn Qutayba’s extracts mostly pertain to [[Khosrow II|Khosrau II (Parviz)]] and suggest a ''mirror for princes''. The subject of the Ketab Mazdak was, as its title implies, the leader of the revolutionary religious movement whose activities led to his execution in 531.A better product of Ibn al-Muqaffa'’s translation activities is the [[Letter of Tansar|Nāma-ye Tansar]], a political work taking its name from its putative author Tansar , the Zoroastrian priestly adviser to the first Sasanian monarch, [[Ardashir I]] . Ibn al-Muqaffa'’s Arabic version is lost, but [[Ibn Isfandiyar|Ibn Isfandiar]]’s Persian rendering of it, made in the early 13th century and embodied in his ''Tarikh-e Tabarestan'' (History of Tabarestan), reveals its content . Apart from adding various illustrative verses, some…in elegant Persian, Ibn al-Muqaffa evidently inserted [[Quranic]] and [[Biblical]] quotations, presumably as a concession to Muslims. Be that as it may, his Sasanian text is still Iranocentric: &lt;blockquote&gt;...we are the best of Persians, and there is no quality or trait of excellence or nobility which we hold dearer than the fact that we have ever showed humility and lowliness…in the service of kings, and have chosen obedience and loyalty, devotion and fidelity. Through this quality…we came to be the head and neck of all the climes...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Original works ===
Two preceptive works in Arabic are ascribed to Ibn al-Muqaffa', '''[[Al-Adab al-Kabīr|al-Adab al-kabīr]]''' and '''al-Adab al-saghir''', but only the first, now known as Kitāb al-ādāb al-kabīr, can be accepted as his . The first of its four parts is a very brief rhetorical retrospect on the excellence of the ancients’ legacy, clearly Sasanian, of spiritual and temporal knowledge. The second is a miniature mirror for princes. The addressee, seemingly the caliph’s son, is apostrophized as one in pursuit of the rule of seemly conduct (adab). He is to give strict priority to the mastery of fundamentals, examples of which are given along with illustrations of the ways in which they can be applied. The author then turns to pitfalls before a prince (e.g., the love of flattery and the fault of allowing others to detect it). More positively, he urges the prince to cultivate men of religion and moral perfection as potential aides and intimates, to take advice, even if unpalatable, from those best qualified to give it, to keep abreast of his officials’ conduct, to be sparing with his favors, and so on. Having defined, very much in a Sasanian vein, the bases of kingship, he discusses particular circumstances calling for caution and prudence. After exhortation to seemly conduct and sundry observations on statecraft he ends by stressing the pivotal role in government of power and a seemly public image. The Ādāb’s third part, longer than the second, is a pragmatic guide to survival for a ruler’s intimates and highly, but precariously, placed officers of state. It offers advice in a high moral vein, but it rests on no philosophical, ethico-religious, or spiritual basis: it rests on familiarity with age-old vagaries of oriental despots and their entourages. The fourth and longest part of the Ādāb treats of a man’s relations with colleagues in what we may take to be the secretarial fraternity. The main theme is friendship and the avoidance of enmity. For Ibn al-Muqaffa', the ideal is a permanent relationship, sustained by fidelity, loyalty, and devotion, and proof against all corrosive forces. As always, his treatment of the subject is didactic and heavily dependent on aphorisms. He remains pragmatic: A friendship should be formed, not with an inferior, but with a superior, for to make friends of inferiors bespeaks envy, which is reprehensible. To shed a friend is a threat to honor—unlike a divorce. To women and their allure he makes certain disparaging references, but they are only incidental to his main interest,promoting companionship and amity in the circles that concern him. One can detect in the Ādāb as a whole certain ideas known to Sasanian Persia from pre-Islamic translations of Greek works . The Ādāb is cast in the parallelistic mode of expression born of the early [[Khotba]] and expanded and elaborated in [[Omayyad]] hortatory compositions, unembroidered with contrived rhyming of the sort found in later [[Abbasid]] prose literature. To point contrasts and enforce parallels, full use is made of devices well known to the ancient schools of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="RoozbehLatham" /&gt;

The '''Risala fi-l-Sahaba''' is a short but remarkably percipient administrative text. In less than 5,000 words, he discusses specific problems facing the new Abbasid regime. The unnamed addressee is identifiable as al-Mansur, who may never have seen it. There is no logical arrangement. After an opening eulogy, purposefully complimentary but devoid of extravagant panegyric, he discusses the army, praising the [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]is in [[Iraq]] but suggesting that, as an ethnically mixed body exposed to heterodox thinking, they should be taught only the tenets of a clear, concise religious code issued by the caliph. Concern for the army’s standing, morale, and future loyalty leads him to suggest reforms, including the removal of fiscal duties from the military, officer recruitment from the ranks based on merit, religious education, inculcation of integrity and loyalty, regular pay linked to inflation, and maintenance of an efficient intelligence service throughout Khorasan and peripheral provinces, regardless of cost. He calls for vigilance and good intelligence in Iraq to counter discontent in [[Basra]] and [[Kufa]] and pleads for deserving Iraqis to be afforded scope for the exercise of their talents in government service. In view of wide divergences in legal theory and practice, born of local precedents or flawed personal reasoning, he suggests to the caliph a scrutiny and resolution of all conflicts of law by his own command and the imposition of unity by a comprehensive enactment. He recommends cautious clemency for the conquered [[Syrian]]s, the recruitment from among them of a hand-picked caliphal elite, the lifting of ruinous economic sanctions, and fair distribution of foodstuffs in the Syrian military districts. At long last, he comes to the caliph’s entourage, which, though introduced in glowing terms, can be perceived as far from ideal. In the past, ministers and secretaries—the approach is tactful—brought the entourage into disrepute: men unworthy of access to the caliph became members to the exclusion of, for instance, scions of the great families of early Islam. The caliph should now remedy the situation by taking account of claims to precedence and singling out for preferment men with special talents and distinguished service records, as well as men of religion and virtue and incorruptible and uncorrupting men of noble lineage. Also, the caliph’s kin and princes of his house should be considered. In a section on land-tax (Kharaj) the author focuses on the arbitrary exploitation of cultivators and recommends taxation governed by known rules and registers. After a few lines on Arabia he closes with a proposal for mass education aimed at achieving uniformity of orthodox belief through a body of paid professional instructors. This would make for stability, and trouble-makers would not go unobserved. The Resāla ends with an expression of pious hopes and prayers for the caliph and his people. Stylistically, the work markedly differs from the Ādāb in certain important respects, the reason for which may be the subject-matter.

Of the various works attributed, rightly or wrongly, to Ibn al-Muqaffa', there are two of which we have only fragments quoted in hostile sources. One, posing a problem of authenticity, may be described as a [[Manichaean]] apologia.&lt;ref name="RoozbehLatham" /&gt; The other is the Moarazat al-Quran, which sees not as anti-Islamic, but rather as an exercise designed to show that in the author’s time something stylistically comparable to the Quran could be composed. Other compositions and occasional pieces attributed to Ibn al-Muqaffa' are the '''Yatima tania'''  a short, sententious epistle on good and bad rulers and subjects ; may be authentic, though the long resāla entitled '''Yatimat al-soltan''' and the collection of aphorisms labeled '''Hekam''' certainly are not. A doxology is almost certainly spurious, though a series of passages and sentences that follow it may have come from the lost Yatima fi’l-rasael.&lt;ref name="RoozbehLatham" /&gt;

==Legacy and commemoration==
The Bosnian poet [[Dzevad Karahasan]] wrote a play about al-Muqaffa. The world premiere was performed in 1994 during the civil war in [[Bosnia-Hercegovina]] by the Bosnian actors [[Zijah Sokolović]] and Selma Alispahić from the National Theatre of Sarajevo under the direction of [[Herbert Gantschacher]] in a production of the Austrian theatre [[ARBOS - Company for Music and Theatre]] in Vienna&lt;ref&gt;Dževad Karahasan "Al-Mukaffa" ARBOS-Wieser-Edition, Klagenfurt-Salzburg 1994, {{ISBN|3-85129-141-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Union of Muslim Scouts''' ({{lang-ar|'''الإتحاد العالمي للكشاف المسلم'''}}) (IUMS) is an autonomous, international body committed to promoting and supporting [[Islam]] within [[Scouting]]. Its headquarters are in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]].

==Establishment==
The idea was first sparked in the 3rd Islamic Conference Summit, held in Taif, KSA (1981).

As a response Qatar Scout association called for the first Islamic conference together with 1st Islamic Jamboree (Doha - January 1982). Establishment officially declared in Amman, Jordan (1989), during the 3rd International Muslim Scouts Conference. In August 1992, the 6th International Scout Conference, in Pakistan, certified the emblem, organization and the statutes of the IUMS.

==Objectives==
The official objectives of IUMS are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =International Union of Muslim Scouts | publisher =OICUN | url =http://www.oicun.org/articles/50/1/International-Union-of-Muslim-Scouts/1.html | accessdate =2007-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*To develop an education [[curriculum]] that should contribute to structure and build the spiritual dimension in the personalities of young [[Muslims]].
*To motivate and promote Islamic Scouting on global basis.
*To extend coordination and cooperation among IUMS members.
*To promote and coordinate social, humanitarian and relief activities within the Union or in cooperation with non-Scout organisations of similar nature.
*To introduce Islamic Scouting in such states where Muslims are residing.
*To develop and promote the spirit of brotherhood and understanding among Muslim Scouts.

==Leadership training==
Since 2006, IUMS has held an annual leadership training course in [[Switzerland]], in conjunction with other organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =EU Muslim Scouts Integrate Better, Preserve Identity | work =[[Journal of Turkish Weekly]] | url =http://www.turkishweekly.net/news.php?id=30070 | accessdate =2007-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islam in the Indian Ocean''' was established by [[Muslim]] [[sea]] [[merchants]] well before the European discovery of [[Seychelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring Islam|url=http://www.nation.sc/index.php?art=6953|publisher=www.nation.sc|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike in other island states including the [[Comoros]] and [[Maldives]], there were no permanent inhabitants in Seychelles until the French settlement in 1770. Today, the Muslim population of the islands is reported to be only 1.1%, roughly 900 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seychelles Population|url=http://www.historycentral.com/nationbynation/Seychelles/Population.html|publisher=www.historycentral.com|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its island neighbors in the southern [[Indian Ocean]], including [[Comoros]], the [[Maldives]] and [[Zanzibar]], have a much larger Muslim influence because of their colonization by Muslims, before [[Europe]]an colonization. [[Mauritius]] also has a much higher Muslim population due to the importation of labour from [[British India]] on a scale not seen in Seychelles. The government of Seychelles allows 15 minutes of religious broadcasting every Friday for the Muslim community.

==Activities==

===2011 survey of European Jewish leaders===
In 2011, [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], led by the American JDC-ICCD, conducted a survey of European Jewish leaders to ascertain concerns and challenges faced by European Jewish communities, including [[Antisemitism]], leadership, intermarriage and status issues, and Europe and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Second Survey of European Leaders Published |publisher=States News Service (via HighBeam Research | date=10 May 2012 | accessdate=30 November 2013 | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-289198546.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 Berlin Conference===
JDC-ICCD partnered with the [[American Jewish Committee]]'s (AJC) Berlin Ramer Institute for German-Jewish Relations to host a conference October 25–27, 2013 titled "Analyzing Jewish Europe Today: Perspectives from a New Generation." Attendees and presenters gathered to discuss new Jewish cultural trends, Muslim-Jewish relations and Jewish revival in Eastern and Central Europe.&lt;ref name="AJC and JDC 2013 conference" /&gt;

{{Quotation|We know from our work on the ground that Europe's emerging Jewish leaders and communities are expressing Jewish identity in profoundly new and unique ways, setting an exciting course for the future of Jewish Europe. While there have been many forums examining Jewish identity of the past, for those of us dedicated to innovating Jewish life today, it was critical to focus on the contemporary European Jewish scene, bring to the fore issues impacting Jews across the continent, and ultimately seize the opportunities resulting from the way young European Jews are engaging with their Jewish identities.|Marcelo Dimentstein, Operations Director of JDC-ICCD.&lt;ref name="AJC and JDC 2013 conference" /&gt;}}

'''Jackie Hill-Perry''' (née Jackie Hill, born June 21, 1989) is an American poet, writer, and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artist from [[St. Louis]]. Hill-Perry initially garnered popularity for her performances of [[spoken word]] pieces such as "My Life as a Stud", "A Poem About Weed", and "Jig-a-Boo" at the Passion 4 Christ Movement (P4CM). She has written for various Christian ministry organizations, such as [[The Resurgence (organization)|The Resurgence]] and [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]'s Desiring God, on the topic of [[Christianity and homosexuality]]. She signed to the [[Portland, Oregon]]-based [[Christian hip hop]] label Humble Beast in January 2014, and released her debut album on November 4, 2014, available both commercially and for free. Hill married fellow spoken word artist Preston Perry in March 2014, and now has a one year old baby girl.

An encounter with sexual abuse as a child contributed to the [[gender identity disorder|confusion over her gender identity]] she faced while growing up, and Hill-Perry at age seventeen decided that she was a lesbian. She lived a life of sexual [[promiscuity]] and struggled with drug and [[pornography addiction]], until her conversion to Christianity in 2008. Her self-proclaimed status as a former lesbian has sparked controversy, with many gay rights activists{{Who|date=August 2018}} stating that [[sexual orientation]] cannot be changed and that Hill-Perry's experience lend credence to the idea of [[conversion therapy]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Hill-Perry, however, maintains her belief that God can transform lives and this faith empowers believers to resist temptation.

==Biography==

=== Early life (birth to 2008) ===
Jackie Hill-Perry was born Jackie Hill on June 21, 1989 in [[St. Louis]].&lt;ref name="hbbio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackie Hill Perry|url=http://www.humblebeast.com/jackie-hill/|website=Humble Beast|publisher=Humble Beast Records|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in fatherless household, and experienced sexual abuse at the age of five.&lt;ref name="hbbio" /&gt; Hill's upbringing instilled her with a knowledge of God, and she attended church until she was ten. However, her encounter with sexual abuse, combined with school bullying and a lack of attention from boys contributed to her struggle with [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="washtimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniels|first1=David|title=Christian rapper Jackie Hill-Perry comes out as ex-gay firebrand|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/27/christian-rapper-jackie-hill-perry-comes-out-as-ex/|website=[[The Washington Times]]|publisher=News World Media Development|accessdate=October 29, 2014|date=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the age of four, Hill felt as though she should have been born a boy, and at age six she started imitating male tendencies, such as standing up to use the toilet.&lt;ref name="wade-o" /&gt; At age 17, she discovered that she was a lesbian, and started pursuing multiple serial relationships with other women.&lt;ref name="washtimes" /&gt; Hill's second girlfriend suggested that she be a [[Butch and femme|stud]], a woman who takes the masculine role in a lesbian relationship.&lt;ref name="wade-o" /&gt; Hill explains that &lt;blockquote&gt;I was never the 'cute chick' but when I became a stud, it seemed like every girl wanted me. I would be in straight clubs and have girls throwing themselves at me. For a girl that's insecure and craves to feel loved, that was like a drug for me.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wholemagazine.org/2013/04/whole-spotlight-jackie-hill.html|title = Whole Spotlight: Jackie Hill|date = April 1, 2013|accessdate = November 1, 2014|website = WHOLE Magazine|publisher = Be Made Whole Ministries|last = Flores|first = Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Frequenting [[gay club]]s and [[gay pride parade]]s, Hill became caught up in a life of drug and [[pornography addiction]], rebellion, and homosexual [[promiscuity]].&lt;ref name="hbbio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washtimes" /&gt; However, in October 2008, she converted to Christianity, and turned away from her previous lifestyle.

=== Conversion and current activities (2008–present) ===
As recounted in her poem "My Life as a Stud", Hill states that "one day, the Lord spoke to me. He said, 'She will be the death of you.' In that moment, the scripture for the wages of sin equal death finally clicked."&lt;ref name="washtimes" /&gt; Hill left her girlfriend, returned to church, and started writing poetry. She performed her first [[spoken word]] piece at a P4CM poetry conference in 2010, and met Preston Perry, the man who would eventually become her husband.&lt;ref name="washtimes" /&gt; Over time, Hill gradually lost interest in women, and Preston proposed to her in August 2013 through the spoken word poem "The Covenant".&lt;ref name="washtimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://erlc.com/article/because-jesus-is-better-an-interview-with-spoken-word-artist-jackie-hill|title = Because Jesus is Better: An interview with spoken word artist Jackie Hill|date = March 4, 2014|accessdate = November 1, 2014|website = The Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission|publisher = [[Southern Baptist Convention]]|last = Newbell|first = Trillia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in March 2014, and Hill-Perry now has a one-year-old baby girl.&lt;ref name="washtimes" /&gt; Hill-Perry attributes that change in her sexuality to God's transformation of her life.&lt;ref name="washtimes" /&gt; Record label Humble Beast announced on January 7, 2014 that it had signed Hill-Perry as an artist.&lt;ref name="signing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horton|first1=Chad|title=Jackie Hill signs with Humble Beast Records|url=http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/news/38-backstage/7603-jackie-hill-signs-with-humble-beast-records|website=[[Rapzilla]]|publisher=Philip Rood and Chad Horton|accessdate=October 29, 2014|date=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has appeared as a guest musician on several Christian hip hop recordings, including ''Because You'' ''Asked'' by [[Swoope]] and ''[[Instruments of Mercy]]'' by [[Beautiful Eulogy]].&lt;ref name="signing" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video: Swoope – #SameTeam Remix ft.

In 2016, she, alongside [[JGivens]] and [[John Givez]], was featured on Lecrae's "Misconceptions 3" from the album Church Clothes 3.

==Stance on homosexuality==
Jackie Hill-Perry maintains that she is an ex-lesbian, and that her transition to heterosexuality is among the changes God worked in her life. On July 31, 2013, Christian hip hop radio show Wade-O Radio published an interview with Hill-Perry where she spoke out against the [[Macklemore]] song "[[Same Love]]".&lt;ref name="wade-o"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniels|first1=David|title=Former Lesbian Jackie Hill Responds to Macklemore's 'Same Love'|url=http://wadeoradio.com/former-lesbian-jackie-hill-responds-to-macklemores-same-love/|website=Wade-O Radio|publisher=DJ Wade-O|accessdate=October 29, 2014|date=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, she stated that &lt;blockquote&gt;The word of God itself, apart from Jackie Hill, testifies that people can change. So if the word of God is the word of God, then we need to deal with that and believe that it's true. I think we've made God very little if we believe that he cannot change people. If he can make a moon, stars and a galaxy that we have yet to fully comprehend, how can he not simply change my desires?&lt;ref name="wade-o" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This stance has been criticized by many, particularly gay rights activists. According to ''[[The Washington Times]]'', Hill-Perry's experience "runs counter to pronouncements by gay rights groups that exclaim sexuality as an inherent, immutable characteristic", and, even further, comes amid "wide-ranging reports about the psychological dangers of so-called '[[reparative therapy]],' which aims to change the orientation of homosexuals."&lt;ref name="washtimes" /&gt; Hill-Perry estimates that about 40 percent of the messages she has received over social media have been negative.&lt;ref name="washtimes" /&gt; When Hill married Preston Perry in March 2014, one critic accused the couple of both being gay and marrying to "play God to a bunch of ignorant people."&lt;ref name="washtimes" /&gt;

However, Hill-Perry, in her 2013 interview with Wade-O Radio, clarified that she does not believe that every Christian with a homosexual disposition will lose those desires. &lt;blockquote&gt;If God chooses not to change my desires, he has promised to give me his Holy Spirit that will help me flee from them. There are people who were alcoholics for 20 years, went through rehab and they don't drink anymore, but sometimes they may be tested. If they see a bottle of whiskey, they're going to want that whisky, but they have a choice.&lt;ref name="wade-o" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influences ==
In an interview with [[The Gospel Coalition]], Hill-Perry cited [[Mali Music]], [[Propaganda (musician)|Propaganda]], and Ebony Moore as "a few people who inspire me to be great at my craft."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/coming-to-you-raw-and-uncut-with-jackie-hill/|title = Coming to You Raw and Uncut with Jackie Hill|date = October 25, 2012|accessdate = October 29, 2014|website = |publisher = [[The Gospel Coalition]]|last = Smethurst|first = Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theologically, she names pastor [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] as a major influence, and even based ''Art of Joy'' on Piper's book ''Desiring God'', where Piper explains his concept of [[Christian hedonism]]. Hill-Perry states that &lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from the [[doctrines of grace]], it's one concept that has really renewed my mind when it comes to faith and sin. Now, when I look at certain sins, it's not, 'Oh, I'm just doing this because I want to.' No, what in this sin do you think will satisfy me that God can't? It makes my processing of my issues a lot deeper, and it's also expanded my view of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniels|first1=David|title=John Piper's book 'Desiring God' inspires Jackie Hill-Perry's album|url=http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/features/interviews/9441-john-piper-s-book-desiring-god-inspires-jackie-hill-perry-s-album|website=[[Rapzilla]]|publisher=Philip Rood and Chad Horton|accessdate=November 20, 2014|date=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Writing==
Jackie Hill-Perry has written for various Christian ministry organizations, focusing on reconciling issues of [[Christianity and homosexuality|homosexuality with Christianity]]. Among these are her articles "Love Letter to a Lesbian", written for Desiring God, a ministry of [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]], and "A [[Christian]] Response to the Same-Sex Marriage Ruling", for [[The Resurgence (organization)|The Resurgence]], a ministry of [[Mars Hill Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Jackie|title=Love Letter to a Lesbian|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/love-letter-to-a-lesbian|website=Desiring God|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=October 29, 2014|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Jackie|title=A Christian Response to the Same-Sex Marriage Ruling|url=http://theresurgence.com/2013/07/15/a-christian-response-to-the-same-sex-marriage-ruling|website=[[The Resurgence (organization)|The Resurgence]]|publisher=[[Mars Hill Church]]|accessdate=October 29, 2014|date=July 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Japa mala (prayer beads) of Tulasi wood with 108 beads - 20040101-01.jpg|thumb|275px|Japa mala, made from [[tulasi]] wood, with head bead in foreground]]
A '''Japamala''' or '''mala''' (Sanskrit:{{lang|sa|माला}}; {{IAST|mālā}}, meaning ''[[garland]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Apte|1965|p=758}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a string of [[prayer beads]] commonly used by [[Hindus]], [[Buddhists]],
[[Jains]] and some [[Sikhs]] for the spiritual [[sadhana|practice]] known in [[Sanskrit]] as ''[[japa]]''. It is usually made from [[108 (number)|108]] [[bead]]s, though other numbers are also used. Malas are used for keeping count while reciting, chanting, or mentally repeating a [[mantra]] or the name or names of [[Brahman|God]].

==Usage==
Mantras are typically repeated hundreds or even thousands of times. The mala is used so that one can focus on the meaning or sound of the mantra rather than counting its repetitions. One repetition is usually said for each bead while turning the thumb [[clockwise]] around each bead, though some traditions or practices may call for counterclockwise motion or specific finger usage. When arriving at the head bead, one turns the mala around and then goes back in the opposing direction. There are typically knots between each bead. This makes using the mala easier as the beads will not be as tight on the string when used. 

If more than 108 repetitions are to be done, then sometimes in Tibetan traditions grains of rice are counted out before the chanting begins and one grain is placed in a bowl for each 108 repetitions. Each time a full mala of repetitions has been completed, one grain of rice is removed from the bowl. Often, practitioners add extra counters to their malas, usually in strings of ten. These may be positioned differently depending on the tradition; for example some traditions place these strings after every 10th bead. This is an alternative way to keep track of large numbers, sometimes going into the hundreds of thousands, and even millions.

The 109th bead on a mala is called the [[sumeru]], [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]], stupa, or [[guru]] bead. Counting should always begin with a bead next to the sumeru. In the [[Hindu]], [[Vedic Chant|Vedic]] tradition, if more than one mala of repetitions is to be done, one changes directions when reaching the sumeru rather than crossing it. 

There are numerous explanations why there are 108 beads, with the [[108 (number)|number 108]] bearing special religious significance in a number of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] traditions.

* 27 Constellations x 4 Padas (parts) = 108
* 12 Zodiac Houses x 9 Planets = 108
* Upanishads or the Scriptures of the Vedas = 108

Thus, when we recite or recount number 108, we are actually remembering the entire universe. This reminds us of the fact that the universal self is omnipresent, that is the innate nature of the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthandyoga.com/html/news/meditation/Sacred_Mala_Beads.aspx|title=The Sacred Mala Beads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations in usage===
Some Hindu traditions hold that the correct way to use a mala is with the right hand, with the thumb flicking one bead to the next, and with the mala draped over the middle finger.  The index finger represents ego, the greatest impediment to [[self-realization]], so it is considered best avoided when chanting on a mala.

In northeast India, particularly those in the [[Shakta]] traditions in [[West Bengal]] and [[Assam]], the mala is often draped on the ring finger of the right hand, with beads moved by the middle finger with aid of the thumb and avoiding the use of the index finger. However, draping the mala over the middle finger and using the thumb to move the beads is also acceptable in these regions.

A wide variety of materials are used to make mala beads. Beads made from the seeds of the [[rudraksha]] tree are considered sacred by [[Saivas]], devotees of Siva, while beads made from the wood of the [[tulsi]] plant are used and revered by [[Vaishnavas]], followers of Vishnu. Other common beads include wood or seeds from the [[sandalwood]] tree or the [[Bodhi tree]], and seeds of the [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus plant]]. Some [[Tibet]]an Buddhist traditions call for the use of animal [[bone]] (most commonly yak), those of past Lamas being the most valuable. Semiprecious stones such as [[carnelian]] and [[amethyst]] may be used, as well. In Hindu [[Tantra]], as well as Buddhist Tantra (or [[Vajrayana]]), materials and colors of the beads can relate to a specific practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6029">'''Jaredite kings''' are a series of monarchs described in the [[Book of Mormon]], comprising chapters 6:22-15 of the Book of Ether. As death was approaching Jared and his brother, they gathered together the people to ask them what they desired of them before they died. The people then requested that they anoint one of their sons as king. This was grievous to them, and the brother of Jared remarked that "surely this thing leadeth into captivity." &lt;ref&gt;Ether 6:23&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his brother's misgivings, Jared pressed him to allow the establishment of a Jaredite kingship at which suggestion the brother of Jared yielded.&lt;ref&gt;Ether 6:24&lt;/ref&gt;

The people chose Pagag, the firstborn of the brother of Jared. He refused. The people then wished to force him to be king but the brother of Jared would not allow that. They suggested his sons, Jacom, Gilgah, and Mahah, but they refused to be king. Then, [[Orihah]], the fourth son, agreed to be king. Thus began the institution of monarchy among the Jaredites sometime after the Tower of Babel and the arrival of the Jaredites in the Americas.

{{History of Tunisia}}
The '''Khurasanid Dynasty''' ({{lang-ar|بنو خراسان}}, ''Banu Khurasan'') was a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] [[dynasty]] centered in [[Tunisia]]. It ruled an independent [[principality]] in [[Tunis]] from 1059 to 1148 when they became governors of Ifriqiya under the Siculo-Norman kings and their annexions into the [[Kingdom of Africa]], until the end of the dynasty in 1159 from the Almohade conquest.&lt;ref name="Brill" /&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Kingdom of Africa}}
The Khurasanid dynasty was founded during the 11th century by Abd al-Haqq ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Khurasan, who was appointed as governor of [[Tunis]] by the [[Hammadid dynasty]]. This followed entreaties by locals seeking protection from raids by the [[Banu Hilal]], as the [[Zirid dynasty]] sultan [[Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis]] offered none.&lt;ref name="Brill" /&gt; Abd al-Haqq soon made the city an independent principality that would be governed by his family for almost a century.

The fourth Khurasanid ruler, Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz (1107-1128), was considered by [[Ibn Khaldoun]] to be the most remarkable of his family. He built ramparts around Tunis to defend it and secured guarantees of safe passage for travellers from the Banu Hilal.&lt;ref name=Gibb&gt;Sir H. A. R. Gibb, ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'' (1954), Brill Archive, page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The principality was annexed to the Hammadid kingdom in 1128, before it recovered its independence in 1148. After a period of Hammadid rule and a brief interregnum during which the people of Tunis sought to elect a new leader, Khurasanid rule was restored when Abu Bakr ibn Ismail was smuggled over the city walls at night in a basket. Seven months later he was drowned by his nephew Abd Allah ibn Abd al-Aziz, who succeeded him.&lt;ref name=Gibb/&gt;

Under Khurasanid rule, the small independent kingdom resumed foreign trade relations and people enjoyed unprecedented prosperity. The city was embellished with new buildings, including a fortified palace, and the outer defenses were strengthened.

In 1159, the last Khurasanid ruler, Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz, was ousted by the [[Almohad Caliphate]] and sent into exile. The Almohads annexed the whole [[Ifriqiya]] to its empire, putting an end to Khurasanid rule.&lt;ref name="Brill"&gt;Martijn Theodoor Houtsma, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UZU3AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover ''E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936''], Brill, Leyde, 1987, p. 967 ({{ISBN|9789004082656}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:YaxchilanDivineSerpent.jpg|upright|thumb|The Classic Maya vision serpent, as depicted at [[Yaxchilan]].]]

'''Kukulkan''' ({{IPA|/kuːkuːlˈkän/}}) ("''Plumed Serpent''", "''Feathered Serpent''") was the name of a [[Yucatec Maya language|Mesoamerican]] serpent deity. Prior to the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|Spanish Conquest of the Yucatán]], Kukulkan was worshipped by the [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]] peoples of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], in what is now Mexico. The depiction of the [[Feathered Serpent]] is present in other cultures of [[Mesoamerica]]. Kukulkan is closely related to the deity [[Q'uq'umatz]] of the [[K'iche' people]] and to [[Quetzalcoatl]] of [[Aztec mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Read &amp; Gonzalez 2000, pp. 180-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of the mythology of this [[Pre-Columbian era]] deity.&lt;ref&gt;Read &amp; Gonzalez 2000, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although heavily Mexicanised, Kukulkan has his origins among the Maya of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]], when he was known as ''Waxaklahun Ubah Kan'' ({{IPA|/waʃaklaˈχuːn uːˈɓaχ kän/}}), the War Serpent, and he has been identified as the Postclassic version of the [[Vision Serpent]] of [[ancient Maya art|Classic Maya art]].&lt;ref&gt;Freidel et al 1993, pp. 289, 325, 441n26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] of Kukulkan/Quetzalcoatl was the first Mesoamerican religion to transcend the old Classic Period linguistic and ethnic divisions.&lt;ref name="sharer"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp 582-3.&lt;/ref&gt; This cult facilitated communication and peaceful trade among peoples of many different social and ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref name="sharer"/&gt; Although the cult was originally centred on the ancient city of [[Chichen Itza]] in the modern [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Yucatán]], it spread as far as the [[Guatemalan Highlands]].&lt;ref name="sharer2"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 619.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Yucatán, references to the deity Kukulkan are confused by references to a named individual who bore the name of the god. Because of this, the distinction between the two has become blurred.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube 1993, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; This individual appears to have been a ruler or priest at Chichen Itza who first appeared around the 10th century.&lt;ref name="read"&gt;Read &amp; González 2000, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Kukulkan was mentioned as a historical person by Maya writers of the 16th century, the earlier 9th-century texts at Chichen Itza never identified him as human and artistic representations depicted him as a Vision Serpent entwined around the figures of nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Freidel et al 1993, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; At Chichen Itza, Kukulkan is also depicted presiding over sacrifice scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Freidel et al 1993, p. 478n60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sizeable temples to Kukulkan are found at archaeological sites throughout the north of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], such as Chichen Itza, [[Uxmal]] and [[Mayapan]].&lt;ref name="read"/&gt;

==Etymology==
In the [[Yucatec Maya language]], the name is spelt ''K'uk'ulkan'' ({{IPA|/kuː kuːlˈkän/}}) and in [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]] it is ''K'uk'ul-chon'' ({{IPA|/kuːˈkuːl tʃʰon/}}).&lt;ref&gt;Freidel et al 1993, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The Yucatec form of the name is formed from the word ''kuk'' "feather" with the adjectival suffix ''-ul'', giving ''kukul'' "feathered",&lt;ref name="yucatec"&gt;[http://www.famsi.org/reports/96072/k/kuk_kulux.htm Yucatec-English Dictionary at FAMSI]&lt;/ref&gt; combined with ''kan'' "snake" (Tzotzil ''chon''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.famsi.org/montgomery_dictionary/mt_entry.php?id=1403&amp;lsearch=ch&amp;search=CHAN/KAN Yucatec-English Dictionary at FAMSI]&lt;/ref&gt; giving a literal meaning of "feathered snake".

Kukulkan was a deity closely associated with the [[Itza people|Itza state]] in the northern [[Yucatán Peninsula]], where the cult formed the core of the [[state religion]].&lt;ref name="sharer"/&gt; Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in earlier Maya traditions, the Itza worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the [[Quetzalcoatl]] cult of central Mexico.&lt;ref name="sharer"/&gt; This influence probably arrived via [[Putún Maya]] merchants from the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="sharer"/&gt; These Chontal merchants probably actively promoted the feathered serpent cult throughout [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref name="sharer"/&gt; Kukulkan headed a pantheon of deities of mixed Maya and non-Maya provenance, used to promote the Itza political and commercial agenda.&lt;ref name="sharer"/&gt;  It also eased the passage of Itza merchants into central Mexico and other non-Maya areas, promoting the Itza economy.&lt;ref name="sharer"/&gt;

At Chichen Itza, Kukulkan ceased to be the Vision Serpent that served as a messenger between the king and the gods and came instead to symbolise the divinity of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Freidel 1990, pp. 394-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mixco Viejo ballcourt marker.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mesoamerican ballcourt|Ballcourt]] marker from the Postclassic site of [[Mixco Viejo]] in Guatemala. This sculpture depicts Kukulkan, jaws agape, with the head of a human warrior emerging from his maw.&lt;ref name="sharer2"/&gt;]]

[[El Castillo, Chichen Itza]] served as a temple to Kukulkan. During the spring and fall [[equinox]]es the shadow cast by the angle of the sun and edges of the nine [[step pyramid|steps of the pyramid]] combined with the northern stairway and the stone serpent head carvings create the illusion of a massive serpent descending the pyramid.

After the fall of Chichen Itza, the nearby Postclassic city of [[Mayapan]] became the centre of the revived Kukulkan cult, with temples decorated with feathered serpent columns.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 598.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]], the high priest of Kukulkan was the family patriarch of the Xiu faction and was one of the two most powerful men in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Freidel 1990, pp. 361-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cult of Kukulkan spread as far as the Guatemalan Highlands, where Postclassic feathered serpent sculptures are found with open mouths from which protrude the heads of human warriors.&lt;ref name="sharer2"/&gt;

==Modern folklore==
Stories are still told about Kukulkan among the modern Yucatec Maya.&lt;ref name="read2"&gt;Read &amp; González 2000, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; In one tale, Kukulkan is a boy who was born as a snake. As he grew older it became obvious that he was the plumed serpent and his sister cared for him in a cave. He grew to such a size that his sister was unable to continue feeding him, so he flew out of his cave and into the sea, causing an earthquake. To let his sister know that he is still alive, Kukulkan causes earth tremors every year in July.&lt;ref name="read"/&gt;

A modern collection of folklore from Yucatán tells how Kukulkan was a winged serpent that flew to the sun and tried to speak to it but the sun, in its pride, burnt his tongue. The same source relates how Kukulkan always travels ahead of the Yucatec Maya rain god [[Chaac]], helping to predict the rains as his tail moves the winds and sweeps the earth clean.&lt;ref&gt;Gómez 1995, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Lacandon people|Lacandon]] Maya of [[Chiapas]], Kukulkan is an evil, monstrous snake that is the pet of the sun god.&lt;ref name="read"/&gt;

Though the Church is prohibited by the [[Manual of The Mother Church]] from publishing membership figures, the number of branch churches in the United States has fallen steadily since World War II.  A 1992 study of the ''Christian Research Journal'' found that church membership had fallen from 269,000 in the 1930s to about 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equip.org/site/c.muI1LaMNJrE/b.2713939/k.B1A1/DC375.htm Study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210044918/http://www.equip.org/site/c.muI1LaMNJrE/b.2713939/k.B1A1/DC375.htm |date=February 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some believe membership has fallen further since then, however current estimates for church membership vary widely, from under 100,000 to 600,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=jour_fac&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dstand%2520porter%2520at%2520the%2520door%2520of%2520thought%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D3%26ved%3D0CC8QFjAC%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdigitalcommons.calpoly.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1009%2526context%253Djour_fac%26ei%3DVT1ST_E7sv-xArvwmPAF%26usg%3DAFQjCNEIn2nDGvJnb-_94iHhijl8yFMUKw%26cad%3Drja#search=%22stand%20porter%20door%20thought%22 Swanson, Douglas J. EdD, "Standing Porter at the Door of Thought": The Social Order of the Christian Science Church, Paper presented in the American Studies section of the Western Social Science Association annual conference, Reno, Nevada, April 20, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Stephen Barrett has reported that since 1971, the number of practitioners and teachers listed in the Christian Science Journal has fallen from about 5,000 to about 1,160 and the number of churches has fallen from about 1,800 to about 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/cs.html Barrett]&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of this list is to identify and quantify this decline in Christian Science institutions and those related to Christian Science, as well as catalog the buildings and spaces once used by the Christian Science Church.  While it is impossible to get accurate membership figures, it is possible to determine the decline in institutions through official church publications and other sources.

==Former buildings in Canada and the United States==
Notes:
*In the status column ''Relocated'' indicates that a church or society sold its building but did not dissolve or merge. ''Merged'' indicates that a church or society merged with another one and relocated.
*The NRHP column is for [[National Register of Historic Places]] or state or local listings with the highest one for a property being indicated as follows: ''Yes'' = NRHP; ''CP'' = [[contributing property]] in an NRHP district, ''State'' =state, territorial, etc., listing; ''Local'' = county, city, etc. listing; and ''No'' = none of these listings.  '''Country''' = CAN for Canada or USA for the United States

==Missing churches in all countries==
''Note'': Following the custom of early New England Congregational and Baptist churches, Churches of Christ, Scientist, in a city or town are numbered ''First'', Second'', Third'', etc. Societies are not numbered, however. Since all churches and societies are listed in the monthly [[Christian Science Journal]], it is possible to determine the numbers of most but not all missing churches. For example, if a city has listings for only second and fourth churches, it is obvious that first and third are missing. As merged churches take the name of the older congregation, first could then be assumed to have dissolved, while third might have dissolved or merged with second. Fifth may have merged, dissolved, or never existed.

Lumbini has a number of temples, including the [[Maya Devi Temple, Lumbini|Mayadevi Temple]] and several others which are still under repair. Many monuments, [[Buddhist monasticism|monasteries]] and a museum, the Lumbini International Research Institute, are also within the holy site. Also there is the Puskarini, or Holy Pond, where the Buddha's mother took the ritual dip prior to his birth and where he had his first bath. At other sites near Lumbini, earlier Buddhas were, according to tradition, born, then achieved ultimate Enlightenment and finally relinquished their earthly forms.

Lumbini was made a [[World Heritage Site]] status by [[UNESCO]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=UNESC01997/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO2014/&gt;

==In Buddha's time==
In the Buddha's time, Lumbini was situated in east of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]] and southwest [[Devadaha]] of [[Shakya]], an oligarchic republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lumbini.planetwebnepal.com/?page_id=475|title=Ramagrama-Devadaha {{!}} Lumbini Development Trust|last=|first=|date=2013|website=lumbini.planetwebnepal.com|publisher=Lumbini Development Trust|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Kapilavastu/|title=Kapilavastu|last=Violatti|first=Cristian|date=12 December 2013|website=Kapilavastu - Ancient History Encyclopedia|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=29 September 2016|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Buddhist tradition, it was there, that the Buddha was born.&lt;ref&gt;J.i.52, 54; Kvu.97, 559; AA.i.10; MA.ii.924; BuA.227; Cv.li.10, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; A pillar discovered at Rummindei in 1896 is believed to mark the spot of [[Ashoka]]'s visit to Lumbini. The site was not known as Lumbini before the pillar was discovered.&lt;ref name=Sen&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist shrines in India|last=Sen|first=Dr. A. C.|publisher=Maha Bodhi Book Agency|location=Kolkota|isbn=978-81-87032-78-6|year=2008|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an inscription on the pillar, it was placed there by the people then in charge of the park to commemorate Ashoka visit and gifts.&lt;ref&gt;See Mukerji: Asoka, p. 27; see p. 201f for details&lt;/ref&gt; The park was previously known as Rummindei, 2&amp;nbsp;mi ({{convert|2|mi|abbr=on}}) north of Bhagavanpura.

The Sutta Nipáta (vs. 683) states that the Buddha was born in a village of the Sákyans in the Lumbineyya Janapada. The Buddha stayed in Lumbinívana during his visit to Devadaha and there preached the Devadaha Sutta.&lt;ref&gt;MA.ii.810&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pillar of Ashoka==
{{Further|Pillars of Ashoka}}
In 1896, General Khadga Samsher Rana and [[Alois Anton Führer]] discovered a great [[Pillars of Ashoka|stone pillar]] at Rummindei, according to the crucial historical records made by the ancient Chinese monk-pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] in the 7th century [[Common Era|CE]] and by another ancient Chinese monk-pilgrim [[Faxian]] in the early 5th century CE. 
The Brahmi inscription on the pillar gives evidence that [[Ashoka]], emperor of the [[Maurya Empire]], visited the place in 3rd-century BCE and identified it as the birth-place of the Buddha.

At the top of the pillar, there is a second inscription by king [[Ripumalla]] (13-14th century CE), who is also known from an inscription at the [[Nigali Sagar]] pillar:

A second pillar of Ashoka is located about 22 kilometers to the northwest of Lumbini, the [[Nigali Sagar]] pillar (with inscription), and a third one 24 kilometers to the west, the [[Gotihawa]] pillar (without inscription).

===Excavation at the Mayadevi Temple in 2013===
[[File:Lumbini - Mayadevi Temple from South, Lumbini (9244243566).jpg|thumb|Maya devi Temple]]
According to Robin Coningham, excavations beneath existing brick structures at the Mayadevi Temple at Lumbini provide evidence for an older timber structure beneath the walls of a brick Buddhist shrine built during the Ashokan era (3rd-century BCE). The layout of the Ashokan shrine closely follows that of the earlier timber structure, which suggests a continuity of worship at the site. The pre-Mauryan timber structure appears to be an ancient tree shrine. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal from the wooden postholes and optically stimulated luminescence dating of elements in the soil suggests human activity began at Lumbini around 1000 BCE.&lt;ref name=Coningham2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coningham |first=RAE |last2=Acharya |first2=KP |last3=Strickland |first3=KM |last4=Davis |first4=CE |last5=Manuel |first5=MJ |last6=Simpson |first6=IA |last7=Gilliland |first7=K |last8=Tremblay |first8=J |last9=Kinnaird |first9=TC |last10=Sanderson |first10=DCW |title=The earliest Buddhist shrine: excavating the birthplace of the Buddha, Lumbini (Nepal) |journal=Antiquity |volume=87 |issue=338 |pages=1104–23 |year=2013 |pmid= |pmc= |doi=10.1017/s0003598x00049899 |url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/11508/1/11508.pdf?DDD6+drk0gp+dul4eg |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205155642/http://dro.dur.ac.uk/11508/1/11508.pdf?DDD6%2Bdrk0gp%2Bdul4eg |archivedate=5 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site, states Coningham, may be a Buddhist monument from 6th-century BCE. Other scholars state that the excavations revealed nothing that is Buddhist, and they only confirm that the site predates the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gombrich]] (2013), [https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/rfg1213.pdf Pseudo-discoveries at Lumbini], Oxford Center for Buddhist Studies, Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fogelin2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lars Fogelin|title=An Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tRV0BgAAQBAJ|date=2 March 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-994822-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present-day==
[[File:Mayadevi Temple and ruins of ancient monasteries in Lumbini 03.jpg|thumb|Mayadevi Temple and ruins of ancient monasteries in Lumbini]]
Lumbini is {{convert|4.8|km|0|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|1.6|km|1|abbr=on}} in width. The holy site of Lumbini is bordered by a large monastic zone in which only monasteries can be built, no shops, hotels or restaurants. It is separated into an eastern and western monastic zone, the eastern having the [[Theravada|Theravadin]] monasteries, the western having [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] monasteries. There is a long water filled canal separating the western and eastern zones, with a series of brick arch bridges joining the two sides along the length. The canal is serviced by simple outboard motor boats at the north end which provides tours.

The holy site of Lumbini has ruins of ancient monasteries, a sacred [[Bodhi tree]], an ancient bathing pond, the [[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashokan pillar]] and the Mayadevi Temple, where the supposed place of birth of Buddha is located. From early morning to early evening, pilgrims from various countries perform chanting and meditation at the site.

A non-governmental organization named Samriddhi Foundation started in 2013 working extensively in the field of education and health specially in government schools of the area where underprivileged children study. A non-governmental organisation called "Asia Pacific Exchange and Cooperation Foundation" (APECF) backed by chairman of the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] and then Prime Minister [[Prachanda]], the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] and a UN group called "United Nations Industrial Development Organization" (UNIDO) signed a deal to develop Lumbini into a "special development zone" with funds worth $3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidoitpo.org.cn/EnAboutus.asp?id=39|title=Programs/Projects &gt;&gt; UNIDO IP Projects &gt;&gt; Introduction|publisher=UNIDOitpo.org|date=|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venture was a China-UN joint project. A broader 'Lumbini Development National Director Committee' under the leadership of [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] was formed on 17 October 2011.&lt;ref name="ekantipur1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/2011/10/17/top-story/lumbini-development-committee-formed-under-dahals-leadership/342357.html|title=Lumbini Development Committee formed under Dahal's leadership|publisher=ekantipur|date=|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six-member committee included [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist)]] leader Mangal Siddhi Manandhar, [[Nepali Congress]] leader Minendra Rijal, Forest Minister Mohammad Wakil Musalman, among other leaders. The committee was given the authority to "draft a master plan to develop Lumbini as a peaceful and tourism area and table the proposal" and the responsibility to gather international support for the same.&lt;ref name="ekantipur1" /&gt;
[[File:Nepal DSCN2126a.jpg|thumb|left|Lumbini]]

[[Nipponzan Myohoji]] decided to build a [[Peace Pagoda]] in the park in 2001, which is visited by many different cultures and religions every day.

Because some [[Hindus]] regard the Buddha as an incarnation of [[Vishnu]], thousands of Hindus have begun to come here on pilgrimage during the full moon of the Nepali month of Baisakh (April–May) to worship [[Maya (mother of Buddha)|Queen Mayadevi]] as '''Rupa Devi''', the mother goddess of Lumbini.

Lumbini was granted [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] status by [[UNESCO]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=UNESC01997/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO2014/&gt;

==On the Nepali rupee==
Nepal's central bank has introduced a 100-rupee Nepali note featuring Lumbini, the birthplace of [[Buddha]]. The [[Nepal Rastra Bank]] said the new note would be accessible only during the [[Dashain]], Nepal's major festival in October 2013. It displays the portrait of Mayadevi, Gautam Buddha's mother in silver metallic on the front. The note also has a black dot which would help the blind recognise the note. The name of the central bank in Latin script would be printed on the note along with the date of printing in both the Christian Era and the [[Bikram Sambat|Bikram Era]]. The new note is being issued following a cabinet decision 27 August.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indistannews.com/buddhas-birthplace-in-nepals-100-rupee-note/ Buddha’s birthplace in Nepal’s 100-rupee note – Indistan News – National, Political and States News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224201/http://www.indistannews.com/buddhas-birthplace-in-nepals-100-rupee-note/ |date=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
Lumbini is a 10-hour drive from [[Kathmandu]] and a 30-minute drive from [[Bhairahawa]].
The closest airport is [[Gautam Buddha Airport]] at Bhairahawa, with flights to and from Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://welcomenepal.com/promotional/tourist-destination/lumbini/|title=Lumbini|publisher=Welcome Nepal|date=|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The India border town of Sonauli in Maharajganj district is 1 hour drive from Lumbini and Nautanwa railway stations in India is just few kilometres away and nearest big city is Gorakhpur which is about 100km and is 4 hours drive from Lumbini.

== New Hotel Construction in Lumbini ==
The nearest airport to Lumbini, that is, the Gautam Buddha Airport in Bhairahawa, is currently undergoing upgradation work. This small domestic airport is soon expected to become an international airport, with latest deadline set for 2019. The upgradation work of the airport has also caught the eye of investors and hoteliers, and a series of new hotels are being constructed now in and around Lumbini, hoping to catch in on the expected international tourist boom once the airport upgradation work is complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-04-12/airport-construction-triggers-hotel-boom-in-rupandehi.html|title=Airport construction triggers hotel boom in Rupandehi|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maya death gods''', known by various names, are two basic types of death gods who are respectively represented by the 16th-century [[Yucatec]] deities Hunhau and Uacmitun Ahau mentioned by Spanish Bishop [[Diego de Landa|Landa]]. Hunhau is the lord of the [[Underworld]]. [[Iconography|Iconographically]], Hunhau and Uacmitun Ahau correspond to the Gods A and B'.

In recent narratives, particularly in the oral tradition of the [[Lacandon people]], there is only one death god (called "Kisin" in [[Lacandon language|Lacandon]]), who acts as the [[antipodal point|antipode]] of the Upper God in the creation of the world and of the human body and soul. This death god inhabits an Underworld that is also the world of the dead. As a ruler over the world of the dead (''Metnal'' or ''[[Xibalba]]''), the principal death god corresponds to the [[Aztec mythology|Aztec deity]] [[Mictlantecuhtli]]. The ''[[Popol Vuh]]'' has two leading death gods, but these two are really one: Both are called "Death," but while one is known as "One Death," the other is called "Seven Death." They were vanquished by the [[Hero Twins]].

The two principal death gods count among the many were-animals and spooks (''[[wayob]]'') inhabiting the Underworld, with the God A ''way'' in particular manifesting himself as a head hunter and a deer hunter.

==Post-Classic names==
''Kisin'' is the name of the death god among the Lacandons as well as the early colonial Choles,&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 132 note 617&lt;/ref&gt; ''kis'' being a root with meanings like "flatulence" and "stench." [[Diego de Landa|Landa]] uses another name and calls the lord of the Underworld and "prince of the devils" ''Hunhau'',&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 132&lt;/ref&gt; a name that, recurring in early Yucatec dictionaries as ''Humhau'' and ''Cumhau'', is not to be confused with Hun-Ahau; ''hau'', or ''haw'', means 'to end' and 'to lay on its back (mouth up)'.&lt;ref&gt;Cordemex Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Other names include ''Yum Kimil'', "Lord of Death" in Yucatán and ''(Ah) Pukuh'' in Chiapas. The name Hun Ahau ("One Lord") appears frequently in the [[Ritual of the Bacabs]], but is never specified as a death god.
''Ah Puch'', though often mentioned in books about the Mayas, does not appear to be an authentic Maya name for the death god. (An Ah Puch is mentioned in the opening of the ''[[Books of Chilam Balam|Book of Chilam Balam]]'' of Chumayel in passing as a ruler of the North, and one of the [[Xibalba]] attendants in the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'' is called Ahal Puh.)&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1970: 303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
[[Image:God A Ah Puch (Kimi).jpg|thumb|180px|God A [[Wayob|way]] as a hunter, Classic period]]

==={{vanchor|K'iche'}}===
In the ''Popol Vuh'', the [[Hero Twins]] descend to the "Place of Fright" (''[[Xibalba]]''), where a pair of Death Gods, Hun-Came ("One-Death") and Vucub-Came ("Seven-Death"), rule over a series of disease-bringing deities. They defeat the Death Gods and put restrictions on their cult.

===Yucatec===
According to one of the earliest sources on Maya religion (Francisco Hernández 1545), Eopuco (i.e., Ah Pukuh) mistreated and killed the [[Bacab]], who was resurrected three days later.&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 207 note 1154&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lacandon===
The skeletal death god Kisin plays a prominent role in Lacandon mythology, chiefly in the following tales:&lt;ref&gt;Boremanse 1986: (i)39-44; (ii)30-38; (iii)78-96; (iv)73-77&lt;/ref&gt;
*(i) The creation of the underworld by the upper god, involving the upper god's death at the hands of Kisin, his resurrection, and Kisin's confinement to the underworld; in his anger, Kisin sometimes kicks the pillars of the earth, thus causing earthquakes;
*(ii) A failed attempt at the creation of human beings in emulation of the upper god, leading to the creation of the "[[totemic]]" animals of certain kin groups (''onen'');
*(iii) The descent of the ancestor Nuxi' into the underworld to woo Kisin's daughter;
*(iv) The description of the destiny of the souls in the underworld, where Kisin (a) burns the souls of evildoers, (b) transforms the souls of certain evildoers into his "domestic animals," (c) hunts for the spider monkey doubles of men destined to die.

==Ritual==
Both God A and God A' figure prominently in the New Year rites depicted in the Dresden Codex. God A' probably corresponds to the death god Uacmitun Ahau in Landa's description of the New year rites. He presides over a year of great mortality. To ward off evil during this year, men would walk over a bed of glowing embers that possibly represented the fires of the Underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 147-149&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:AhPuch.jpg|right|frame|God A in the lunar eclipse tables of the [[Dresden Codex]]]]

==Classic Period: God A==
The death god classified as God A always has a fleshless skull, usually with a skeletal body. He often occurs in the following contexts.

===Man Hunt and Deer hunt===
With varying hieroglyphic names and attributes, God A figures in processions and random arrays of were-animals and spooks ([[wayob]]).&lt;ref&gt;Grube and Nahm 1994: 705-707&lt;/ref&gt; In connection with these apparitions, he tends to be depicted either as a headhunter or as deer hunter (see figure). On the grandiose [[Tonina]] stucco wall, the severed head is that of an enemy king. The death god's deer hunt has two sides. On the one hand, this deer hunt may metaphorically refer to a hunt for human victims. On the other hand, there also seems to be a connection with certain ''wayob'' shaped like deer but with the tail of a spider monkey. On the famous peccary skull from Copan, for example, such a deer ''way'' appears to be welcoming the death god returning from a hunt.

===Jaguar baby transformation===
Together with the Rain Deity [[Chaac]], God A is present at the jaguar transformation of a man (possibly a hero) who is usually shown as a baby, and who seems to disappear into the underworld.--

Apart from these contexts, on a Copan bench, the earth-carrying [[Bacab]]s are paired off with death gods A. This may relate to the fact that in Yucatán, one of the four Bacabs was called "White Death" (Zaccimi).

==Classic Period: God A'==
The other codical death god is God A', corresponding to Landa's Uac Mitun Ahau, and characterized by a black stripe over the eyes and a "darkness" infix in the forehead. Just like death god A, he figures among the Classic [[wayob]].&lt;ref&gt;Grube and Nahm 1994: 707–709&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of being a head hunter, however, God A' is a demonic apparition repeatedly shown in the illusionistic act of self-decapitation. His iconography shows considerable overlap with that of an anthropomorphic way (labeled ''Mokochih'') and of a demonic flying insect sometimes carrying a torch (possibly a blowfly, firefly, or wasp). In spite of the above, it has been suggested that the hieroglyphic name of God A' should be read as ''Akan'', a name otherwise only known as that of a 16th-century deity of alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;Grube 2004: 59-63; cf. Stone and Zender 2011: 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calendrical and astrological functions==
A text from the early colonial songbook of [[Dzitbalche]] states the Underworld (''Miitnal'') to be opened and Kisin (''Cizin'') to be liberated during the concluding twenty days of the year (''Uayah-yaab'').&lt;ref&gt;Barrera Vazquez 1965: 34&lt;/ref&gt; In the Classic period, the head of the skeletal God A serves as (i) the hieroglyph for the day Kimi, "Death," corresponding to ''Kame''' in Quiché, also the name of the paired rulers of ''[[Xibalba]]'' in the ''Popol Vuh''; (ii) the hieroglyph for the number ten (''lajun''), perhaps because the verbal stem ''laj-'' means "to end;" (iii) a variable element in glyph C of the Lunar Series, registering one to six completed lunations, probably for the prediction of lunar eclipses. Apparently connected to this, God A can be depicted with the attribute of a crescent that seems to mark him as a lunar patron deity.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., research.mayavase.com: Kerr 5166&lt;/ref&gt; A vignette of God A (or perhaps his female counterpart) illustrates the lunar eclipse tables of the Dresden Codex (see figure).

Pilgrimage is the travel from one's home to a sacred place of importance within one's faith. The journey itself holds a spiritual significance for the traveler because by participating in this ritual, they renew their faith and/or try to bring about a practical result. In the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] faith, the believers may make a pilgrimage at any time of the year and to multiple places. Pilgrimages create networks that connect people and places over long distances, so as to transcend the limits of the local community as well as time. '''Maya pilgrimage''' displays many specific attributes unique to their culture even though they have been heavily influenced by the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] faith since the 15th century. In spite of that, they continue to make their pilgrimage to local shrine sites which are distinctly Maya. These ancient sites are used to communicate to deities or spirits and may be used to appeal to them for help. Though the images on these shrines may now represent [[Christian Saint|Christian saints]], aspects of the ancient Maya tradition still exists. The following will describe the fundamentals and purpose of Maya pilgrimage as well as the influence [[Christianity]] had on it.

==Ritual location==
To understand pilgrimage we must explore the locations where the Maya traveled. The natural places that attracted importance in [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures were mountains, cliffs, boulders, caves, ruins, bodies of water, and islands. These places were usually isolated and remote so the Maya made journeys to visit them. Around 1500, [[Chichen Itza]] used to attract pilgrims from all the surrounding kingdoms to its large cenote; other pilgrims visited local shrines, such as those of [[Ix Chel]] and other goddesses on the islands off [[Yucatán]]'s east coast. The Maya usually made shrines at these locations because they believed that the geographical significance created an easier place to communicate with spirits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maya Pilgrimages to Ritual Landscapes|last=Palka|first=Joel|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Albuquerque|pages=9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each location had one deity associated with it though the Maya could pray to any god they needed. For example, the "gremio" pilgrimage is held annually before each year's rainy season to appeal to the gods for a good season. Each day is dedicated to a different rain god and a different world direction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Astor-Aguilera|first=Miguel|last2=Jarvenpa|first2=Robert|date=2008|title=Comparing Indigenous Pilgrimages: Devotion, Identity, and Resistance in Mesoamerica and North America|url=|journal=Anthropos|issue=103|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ritual locales were identified archaeologically by finding the usual trappings associated with ritual. These included terraces, platforms, shrines, altars, incense, offerings, burials, and rock art. These items were created by the pilgrims to try to communicate with or to appease the gods or spirits in the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Along with these certain geographical features, the site of the shrine often was a sacred place in which an apparition has appeared, inanimate objects were seen to have come to life, or a miracle has occurred.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pilgrimage in Latin America|last=Crumrine|first=Ross|last2=Morinis|first2=Alan|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=New York|pages=5–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, pilgrimages often involve reciprocal visits of the village saints (as represented by their statues), but also visits to farther-removed sanctuaries, as exemplified by the [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']] pilgrimages to their thirteen sacred mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Adams and Brady 2005: 301-327&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for pilgrimage==
The purpose of these travels may be common place or they may have much spiritual meaning to the traveler. To the Maya, pilgrimage is a part of everyday life because they may make the journey to a sacred site for a commonplace reason. They can ask the deity to heal a sick family member, to have a good harvest that year, or they can ask for rain. Whatever the reason, the Maya can and will travel to these remote locations to appeal to the gods for assistance. And by making the right offering, the Maya may expect what they prayed for.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==How to make the pilgrimage==
To travel, one only needs the funds and a need to talk to the spirits. Usually, the strongest in the village make the journey, but all ages and different socioeconomic statuses are welcome to. Previously, the Maya would only walk to each site but nowadays, there is often transportation provided though some still opt for the traditional walk along ancient Maya roads. If one cannot make the trip, they can also donate money, food, or other goods to actual participants, thus making the pilgrimage in spirit. In this way, they can expect to have their name read in front of the [[shrine]]. Sometimes, if it is a movable object, the object of veneration may be taken on a journey to other shrine sites so more pilgrims have access to it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Outcome==
By making these pilgrimages, the participants gain several things. They gain the solidarity and bond among their village by going through this journey together. This creates solidarity between different villages because by making this expedition they gain an understanding among each other. The pilgrimage also creates lasting friendships through the generations because people of all ages are welcome to attend. Those who undertake the pilgrimage gain prestige and respect too. By participating in this ritual, they gain the acceptance and pride of their village.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another outcome from pilgrimages, though less expected, is the spread of ideas. Patel argues that pilgrimage was the reason for the spread of the [[Quetzalcoatl]] or feathered serpent cult all about [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maya Worldviews at Conquest|last=Patel|first=Shankari|publisher=University Press of Colorado|year=2009|isbn=|location=Colorado|pages=205–217|chapter=Religious Resistance and Persistence on Cozumel Island}}&lt;/ref&gt; And through the spread of this cult, the cult in turn also spread the [[Mixtec]]a-Puebla art style. This art style, also known as International style, was used at a number of shrine sites and seemed to increase communication with foreign pilgrims more because there was less emphasis on text and more on common symbols which could be understood by all.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By meeting at these pilgrimages or shrine sites, the travelers would meet and exchange ideas and sometimes even goods. By this exchange, the ideas and goods could travel long distances without the need for one person to facilitate the spread.

==Changing pilgrimage==
After the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|Spanish]] conquest, these pilgrimages changed somewhat to incorporate [[Catholicism|Catholic]] celebrations and saints. Of course, some of the pilgrimages stayed devoted to their traditional Maya gods so Catholic priests could not be present because it was deemed heretical by the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This combination of Christian and Maya beliefs left scholars divided over whether the Maya could truly be considered Christians. Though they adhere to the classic forms of Christianity, like prayers, mass, worship of saints, and celebration of events on the Christian calendar, the Maya celebrate much like their ancestors did through dance, pilgrimages, and other pre-conquest rituals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although the Maya have not always been Christian, they have used the cross since before the Spanish conquest. One such pilgrimage to the village of Xokén in [[Yucatán]] is centered around a large carved stone cross. The local Maya have inhabited this area since before the arrival of the Spanish and several 16th century Maya documents have written accords about the pilgrimage to this site. This cross is found to be placed at the end of an ancient Maya road that linked several of the ancient Maya [[Postclassic period|Postclassic]] cities. Also interesting is that these cities were all at or near major sites of rebellion against the Spanish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another site of pre-conquest crosses lies at Chumpon, where there is a myth that crosses appeared on trees of mahogany and spoke to the Maya. It was said that these crosses protected the Maya and helped them struggle against their enemy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This tradition of the cross symbol, though developed separately in the Maya and Christian societies, continues to link the two traditions together.

In an interview, Kerr stated that her ancestry is mostly English, with smaller amounts of Scottish and French.{{#tag:ref|"I'm pretty much just Australian – obviously, in my blood, there's a lot of English, I have Scottish, I have a little bit of French, I have English."}}&lt;!-- READ TALK BEFORE EDITING ETHNIC BACKGROUND http://justjared.buzznet.com/2009/09/11/miranda-kerrs-biggest-runway-mishap-flying-shoe/ FIND BETTER SOURCE --&gt; During her childhood, Kerr "raced motorbikes and rode horses on her grandmother's farm". She describes her early life in the Australian countryside as "very grounding ... there wasn't any pretentiousness and no one really cared what you were wearing. You could just be you."&lt;ref name="MIRANDASMODELLIFE"&gt;Elissa Blake (11 November 2007).

Her family moved to [[Brisbane]] to allow Kerr and her brother to experience city life. She graduated from [[All Hallows' School]] in 2000. Kerr studied nutrition and [[health psychology]] before pursuing modelling.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Field (8 October 2009).

==Career==

===1997–2006: Career beginnings===
At age 13, Kerr entered and won the 1997 annual ''Dolly'' magazine/Impulse model competition. She was flown to Sydney a week before her 14th birthday to shoot for the magazine. Upon Kerr's win, local media expressed "concerned outrage" at her young age. The controversy raised concerns about the glorification of young girls within the fashion, beauty, and entertainment industries.&lt;ref name="MIRANDASMODELLIFE"/&gt;

Some media outlets{{According to whom|date=February 2014}} claimed her ''Dolly'' shoot (including images of a 14-year-old Kerr in bathing suits) constituted a form of [[paedophilia]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

In February 2010, Kerr became the subject of global headlines when David Kiely, a banker at [[Macquarie Bank]] in Sydney, was caught viewing explicit photos of her on his computer while in the background of a colleague's live television interview with [[Seven Network|Channel 7]].

In response to claims that Kerr is a practicing Buddhist, she told ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', "I'm not Buddhist. I'm Christian. I pray every day. I meditate every day and I do yoga.

"…I'm not Buddhist. Orlando is," she told The Telegraph. "I'm Christian."}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She later told ''Into The Gloss'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I like to pray and I like to meditate. Doing just three minutes of prayer and a minimum of five minutes meditation twice a day sets the tone—like an arrow so that you're hitting your target. When I pray I always thank Mother Nature for all the beauty in the world; it's about having an attitude of gratitude. And then I pray to Christ to say, 'Thank you for this day and my family and my health,' and now that I'm older I've added, 'Please illuminate me. Please open my heart chakra. Open my aperture and uplift my consciousness so that I can be the best version of myself.'&lt;ref name=Gloss&gt;{{cite web|title=Miranda Kerr's 7 Rules For Adulthood|url=http://intothegloss.com/2014/08/miranda-kerr-interview/|website=Into The Gloss|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She credits meditation, speaking with friends, and writing as ways of dealing with challenges such as the death of her then-boyfriend at age 15,&lt;ref name=Grose/&gt; and "makes it a priority to pray about forgiving herself and others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/supermodel-miranda-kerr-says-prayer-gratitude-forgiveness-are-daily-rules-she-lives-by-125046/|title=Supermodel Miranda Kerr Says Prayer, Gratitude, Forgiveness Are Daily Rules She Lives By|last=Martinez|first=Jessica|date=19 August 2014|publisher=[[The Christian Post]]|accessdate=21 August 2014|quote=The Australian model says she is Christian despite previous reports that she is a practicing Buddhist and believes in the power of forgiveness even in the "little things like looking at someone the wrong way, or snapping at someone." She also notes that she makes it a priority to pray about forgiving herself and others because when she does, it creates an "energy shift" in her life. "Even those that we find challenging to be around are sometimes the people that need the prayers the most," said Kerr. "If you've had an intense conversation with someone, a good thing to do would be to say to them, 'I forgive you, and please forgive me.' We all say things sometimes to hurt people, so it's important to forgive and have peace …"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mon''' ({{lang-mnw|မောန်}} or {{lang|mnw|မည်}}; {{lang-my|မွန်လူမျိုး‌}}, {{IPA-my|mʊ̀ɴ lù mjó|pron}}; {{lang-km|មន}}, {{lang-th|[[wikt:มอญ|มอญ]]}}, {{IPA-th|mɔ̄ːn|pron}}) are an [[ethnic group]] native to [[Myanmar]]'s [[Mon State]], [[Bago Region]], the [[Irrawaddy Delta]] and the southern border with [[Thailand]]. One of the earliest peoples to reside in [[Southeast Asia]], the Mon were responsible for the spread of [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] in [[Indochina]]. The Mon were a major source of influence on the [[culture of Myanmar]]. They speak the [[Mon language]], an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language]], and share a common origin with the [[Nyah Kur people]] of Thailand, they are from the Mon [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]] (polity) of [[Dvaravati]].

The eastern Mon include the current [[Chakri dynasty|royal family of Thailand]] who are of Mon ancestry. The Mon assimilated to [[Thai people|Thai]] culture long ago, yet the royal women of the Chakri dynasty perform and keep their Mon heritage alive in the Thai court. The western Mon of Myanmar were largely absorbed by [[Bamar people|Bamar]] society. They have worked to preserve their language and culture and to regain a greater degree of political autonomy. 

Recent studies have adduced evidence indicating that the Mon and Bamar share some common genetic ancestry. A genetic study done on Mon from Southern Myanmar and Bamar from Southern Myanmar showed a high prevalence of a particular [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (G6PD) mutation not found among [[Khmer people|Khmers]], [[Lao people|Laotians]] or [[Thai people|Thais]].{{sfn|Nuchprayoon|2007}}

In the [[Burmese language]], the term '''Mon''' မွန် ({{IPA-my|mʊ̀ɴ|pron}}) is used. During the pre-colonial era, the Burmese used the term '''Talaing''' (တလိုင်း), which was subsequently adopted by the British, who also invariably referred to the Mon as '''Peguans''', during the colonial era.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Mon Nationalism and Civil War in Burma: The Golden Sheldrake|last=South|first=Ashley|date=2013-01-11|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781136129629|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology of Talaing is debated; it may be derived from [[Telangana]] or [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]], a geographic region in southeast India.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/MiscellaneousNotesOnTheWordtalaing|title=Miscellaneous Notes on the Word "Talaing"|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "Talaing" predates the Burmese conquest of the [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] in the 1700s and has been found on inscriptions dating to the reign of [[Anawrahta]] in the 1000s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Mon Paradigm and the Myth of the “Downtrodden Talaing”|date=2005|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wn0qs1.14|work=The Mists of Ramanna|pages=261–280|editor-last=Aung-Thwin|editor-first=Michael A.|series=The Legend That Was Lower Burma|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|isbn=9780824828868|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 and 1947, Mon ethnic leaders, who considered the term "Talaing" to be pejorative, petitioned against the use of the term. "Talaing" is now obsolete in modern Burmese, except in the context of specific historical terms, such as the eponymous song genre in the [[Mahagita]], the corpus of Burmese classical songs. The Burmese term "Mon" is synonymous with the Burmese word for "noble."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sealang.net/burmese/|title=SEAlang Library Burmese Lexicography|website=sealang.net|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Mon language]], the Mon are known as the '''Mon''' (spelt မောန် or မန် and pronounced {{IPA|/mòn/}}), based on the Pali term '''[[Ramannadesa|Rāmañña]]''' (ရာမည), which refers to the Mon heartland along the Burmese coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rāmañña - oi|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100402836|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical Mon literature, they are known as the '''Raman''' (ရာမန်).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
The Mon were believed to be one of the earliest peoples of [[Indochina]]. They founded some of the earliest civilizations there, including [[Dvaravati]] in Central Thailand (whose culture proliferated into [[Isan]]), Sri Gotapura&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.heritagecruise.net/laos/laos-history/the-mon-a-khmer-kingdoms.html |title=Sri Gotapura |access-date=2013-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031024149/http://www.heritagecruise.net/laos/laos-history/the-mon-a-khmer-kingdoms.html |archive-date=2014-10-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in central Laos (modern Sikhottabong, [[Vientiane Prefecture]]) and Northeastern Thailand, [[Hariphunchai]] in Northern Thailand and the [[Thaton Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63,76–77}} They were the first receivers of [[Theravada]] missionaries from [[Sri Lanka]], in contrast to their [[Hindu]] contemporaries like the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] and [[Cham people]]s. The Mon adopted the [[Pallava alphabet]] and the oldest form of the [[Mon script]] was found in a cave in modern [[Saraburi]] dating around 550 AD. Though no remains were found belonging to the Thaton Kingdom, it was mentioned widely in [[Bamar people|Bamar]] and [[Lanna]] chronicles. The legendary Queen [[Camadevi]] from the [[Chao Phraya River|Chao Phraya River Valley]], as told in the Northern Thai Chronicle ''[[Cāmadevivaṃsa]]'' and other sources, came to rule as the first queen of Hariphunchai (modern [[Lamphun]]) kingdom around 800 AD.

After 1000 AD onwards the Mon were under constant pressure. With the [[Tai peoples]] migrating from the north and Khmer invasions from the east, the Mons of Dvaravati gave their way to the [[Lavo Kingdom]] by around 1000 AD. Descendants of the Dvaravati Mon people are the [[Nyah Kur people]] of Isan. The Mon were killed in wars, transported as captives, or assimilated into new cultures. The Mon as an entity virtually disappeared in Chao Phraya Valley. However, Hariphunchai kingdom survived as a Mon outpost in northern Thailand under repeated harassment by the [[Northern Thai people]].

In 1057, King [[Anawrahta]] of [[Pagan Kingdom]] conquered the Thaton Kingdom. The Mon culture and the [[Mon script]] were readily absorbed by the Burmese and the Mons, for the first time, came under Bamar rule. The Mon remained a majority in Lower Burma.

Hariphunchai prospered in the reign of King Aditayaraj (around early twelfth century), who allegedly waged wars with [[Suryavarman II]] of [[Angkor]] and constructed the Hariphunchai [[stupa]]. In 1230, [[Mangrai]], the Northern Thai chief, conquered Hariphunchai and the Mon culture was integrated into Lanna culture. The Lanna adopted the Mon script and religion.

[[Image:Rajadhirat.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Razadarit]] (1384-1422)]]
In 1287, the [[Pagan Kingdom]] collapsed, leaving the power vacuum. [[Wareru]], who was born from a Mon mother and a Tai father, at Domwon Village in the Thaton District, went to Sukhothai for merchandise and later eloped with a daughter of the king. He established himself in [[Mottama]] and was proclaimed king of the Mon. The capital was later moved to [[Bago, Burma|Bago]]. His [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] (1287–1539) was a prosperous period for the Mon in both power and culture. The Mon were consolidated under King [[Razadarit|Rajathiraj]] (1383–1422), who successfully fended off invasions by the Bamar [[Ava Kingdom]]. The reigns of Queen [[Shin Sawbu]] (1453–1472) and King [[Dhammazedi]] (1472–1492) were a time of peace and prosperity.

The Bamar, however, regained their momentum at [[Taungoo]] in the early sixteenth century. Hanthawaddy fell to the invasion of King [[Tabinshwehti]] of Taungoo in 1539. After the death of the king, the Mon were temporarily freed from Bamar rule by [[Smim Htaw]], but they were defeated by King [[Bayinnaung]] in 1551. The Bamar moved their capital to Bago, keeping the Mon in contact with royal authority. Over the next two hundred years, the Mon of Lower Burma came under Bamar rule.

Lower Burma became effectively war fronts between the Bamar, the Thai and the [[Rakhine people]]. Following King [[Naresuan]]’s campaigns against the Bamar, the Mon were, either forced or voluntarily, moved to Thailand. The collapse of Mon power propagated waves of migration into Thailand, where they were permitted to live in city of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]. A Mon monk became a chief advisor to King Naresuan.

Bago was plundered by the Rakhine in 1599. Bamar authority collapsed and the Mon loosely established themselves around Mottama. Only with the unification of King [[Anaukpetlun]] in 1616 were the Mon again under the rule of the Bamar. The Mon rebelled in 1661 but the rebellion was put down by King [[Pye Min]]. Mon refugees were granted residence in western Thailand by the Thai king. The Mons then played a major role in Thai military and politics, as they would later established the Chankri Dynasty of Thailand. A special regiment was created for the Mon serving the Thai king.

Bamar power declined rapidly in the early eighteenth century. Finally, the Mon rebelled again at Bago in 1740 with the help of the Gwe [[Shan people]]. A Bamar monk with Taungoo royal lineage was proclaimed king of Bago and was later succeeded by [[Binnya Dala]] in 1747. With the French support, the Mon were able to establish [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom|an independent kingdom for 17 years]] before falling to [[Alaungpaya]] in 1757. Alaungpaya, the Bamar ruler U Aungzeya, invaded and devastated the kingdom, killing tens of thousands of Mon, including learned Mon priests, pregnant women, and children. Over 3000 priests were massacred by the victorious Bamar in the capital city alone. Thousands more priests were killed in the countryside. Alaungpaya's army was hugely supported by the [[British Empire|British]] army. This time, Bamar rule was harsh. The Mon were largely massacred, encouraging a large migration to Thailand and Lanna.

The Mon rebelled at [[Dagon]] in the reign of [[Hsinbyushin]] of the [[Konbaung Dynasty]] and the city was razed to the ground. Again in 1814 the Mons rebelled and were, as harshly as before, put down. These rebellions generated a huge wave of migrations that the Child-Prince [[Mongkut]] proceeded to welcome the Mon himself. Mongkut himself and the Chakri dynasty of Thailand today are Mon descendants. Thongduang or [[Rama I]] was born in 1737 in the reign of King [[Boromakot]] of Ayutthaya. Rama I's father was Thongdi, a Mon noble serving the royal court of Ayuthaya.

The Mon in Thailand settled mainly in certain areas of [[Central Thailand]], such as [[Pak Kret]] in [[Nonthaburi Province|Nonthaburi]], [[Phra Pradaeng]] in [[Samut Prakan Province|Samut Prakan]] and [[Ban Pong]], among other minor Mon settlements. Mon communities built their own [[Buddhist temple]]s. Over time, the Mons were effectively integrated into Siamese society and culture, although maintaining some of their traditions and identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/928173/ Wat's the centre of Mon tradition - Bangkok Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial period===
[[File:Mon woman, 1904.gif|thumb|An ethnic Mon woman in Thailand, in 1904.]]
Burma was conquered by the [[British Empire|British]] in a series of wars. After the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]], the Mon territories were completely under the control of the British. The British aided the Mons to free themselves from the rule of the Burman monarchy. Under Burman rule, the Mon people had been massacred after they lost their kingdom and many sought asylum in the Thai Kingdom. The British conquest of Burma allowed the Mon people to survive in Southern Burma.

===Post-independence===
The Mon soon became anti-colonialists and, following the grant of independence to Burma in 1948, they sought [[self-determination]]. [[U Nu]] refused them this and they rose in revolt to be crushed again.

They have remained a repressed and defiant group in the country since then. They have risen in revolt against the central Burmese government on a number of occasions, initially under the [[Mon People's Front]] and from 1962 through the [[New Mon State Party]]. A partially autonomous Mon state, [[Monland]], was created in 1974 covering [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]], [[Pegu]] and [[Ayeyarwady River]]. Resistance continued until 1995 when NMSP and [[SLORC]] agreed a cease-fire and, in 1996, the [[Mon Unity League]] was founded.

In 1947, [[Mon National Day]] was created to celebrate the ancient founding of [[Hanthawady]], the last Mon Kingdom, which had its seat in Pegu. (It follows the full moon on the 11th month of the [[Mon lunar calendar]], except in [[Phrapadaeng]], Thailand, where it is celebrated at [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]]).

The largest Mon refugee communities are currently in Thailand, with smaller communities in the [[United States]] (the largest community being in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] and the second largest being [[Akron, Ohio]]), [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], and the [[Netherlands]].

==Language and script==
{{See also|Mon language}}
The [[Mon language]] is part of the [[Monic languages|Monic]] group of the [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] family, closely related to the [[Nyah Kur language]] and more distantly related to [[Khmer language|Khmer]]. The writing system is [[Brahmic family of scripts|Indic]] based. The Burmans adapted the [[Mon script]] for Burmese following their conquest of Mon territory during [[Anawrahta]]'s reign.

==Traditional culture==
[[Image:MonVirgins.jpg|thumb|middle|210px|Mon girls in traditional [[folk costume]]]]
Mon culture and traditional heritages includes spiritual dances, musical instruments such as the [[kyam]] or "crocodile xylophone", the [[saung]] harp and a flat stringed instrument. Mon dances are usually played in a formal theater or sometimes in an informal district of any village. The dances are followed by background music using a circular set of tuned drums and claps, crocodile xylophone, gongs, flute, flat guitar, harp, etc. Mon in Burma wear clothes similar to the Bamars. Those living in Thailand have adopted [[Thai people|Thai]] style scarfs and skirts.

The symbol of the Mon people is the [[hamsa (bird)|hongsa]] ({{lang-mnw|ဟံသာ}}, {{IPA-mnw|hɔŋsa|}}), a mythological water bird that is often illustrated as a swan. The hongsa is the state symbol of [[Bago Region]] and [[Mon State]], two historical Mon strongholds. It is commonly known by its Burmese name, ''hintha'' ({{lang-my|ဟင်္သာ}}, {{IPA-my|hɪ́ɴθà|IPA}}).

[[File:Zusters in Sevilla.JPG|thumb|A novice is at left. The habit of a novice often differs from that of the full professed monks.]]
The '''novitiate''', also called the '''noviciate''', is the period of training and preparation that a Christian ''[[novice]]'' (or ''prospective'') [[monk|monastic]], apostolic, or member of a [[religious order]] undergoes prior to taking [[Religious vows|vows]] in order to [[Discernment|discern]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; whether he or she is [[Religious calling|called]] to vowed religious life. It often includes times of intense study, [[Christian prayer|prayer]], living in community, studying the vowed life, deepening one's relationship with God, and deepening one's self-awareness. It is a time of creating a new way of being in the world. The novitiate stage in most communities is a two-year period of formation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Canon Law]] 653.1&lt;/ref&gt; These years are "Sabbath time" to deepen one's relationship with God, to intensify the living out of the community's mission and charism, and to foster human growth. The novitiate experience for many communities includes a concentrated program of prayer, study, reflection and limited ministerial engagement.

Novices are not admitted to [[monastic vows|vows]] until they have successfully completed the prescribed period of training and proving, called the novitiate. In the [[Middle Ages]] novices typically would have dormitories in separate areas within a [[monastery]]; an early [[Cistercian]] monastery, [[Royal Monastery of Our Lady of the Wheel]], founded in 1202, has this chamber clearly visible today.

Earlier, different orders followed their own rules governing the length and conditions of the novitiate. At the time of the [[Reformation]], the [[Council of Trent]] legislated the length and conditions by which anyone aspiring to become a [[monk]] is obliged to be a novice; the usual period is at least one year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11144a.htm|title=Novice|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the [[aptitude]] of the [[candidate]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;The novitiate, through which life in an institute is begun, is arranged so that the novices better understand their divine vocation, and indeed one which is proper to the institute, experience the manner of living of the institute, and form their mind and heart in its spirit, and so that their intention and suitability are tested.
:—Canon Law 646&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Conscious of their own responsibility, the Novices are to collaborate actively with their Director in such a way that they faithfully respond to the grace of a divine vocation.
:—Canon Law 652.3&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Members of the institute are to take care that they cooperate for their part in the work of formation of the Novices through example of life and prayer
:—Canon Law 652.3&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Novices are to be led to cultivate human and Christian virtues; through prayer and self denial they are to be introduced to a fuller way of perfection; they are to be taught to contemplate the mystery of salvation and to read and meditate on the sacred scriptures; they are to be prepared to cultivate the worship of God in the sacred liturgy; they are to learn a manner of leading a life consecrated to God and humanity in Christ through the evangelical counsels; they are to be instructed regarding the character and spirit, the purpose and discipline, the history and life of the institute; and they are to be imbued with love for the Church.
:—Canon Law 652&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A novice is free to quit the novitiate at any time, and the Novice Director, Formation Director, or [[superior (hierarchy)|Superior]] is free to dismiss him or her with or without cause in most communities.

Often, in novicating, the vows are continuous through training.

In some novitiate communities, mostly monastic, the novice often wears clothing that is distinct from secular dress but is not the full [[Religious habit|habit]] worn by [[Profession (religious)|professed]] members of the community. The novice's day normally encompasses participation in the full [[canonical hours]], manual labor, and classes designed to instruct novices in the religious life he is preparing to embrace. Spiritual exercises and tests of humility are common features of a novitiate. Some [[Roman Catholic]] communities encourage frequent [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and reception of [[Holy Communion]] by their novices.

A Superior will often appoint an experienced member of the community to oversee the training of novices. This may be a Finally Professed Member, [[novice master]] or mistress who is responsible for the training of all novices.

Different religious communities will have varying requirements for the duration of the novitiate. Often one must complete a [[postulant|postulancy]] before officially entering the novitiate. In many apostolic religious communities in the United States, postulancy or candidacy is one to three years. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the novitiate is officially set at three years before one may be [[tonsure]]d a monk or nun, though this requirement may be [[Economy (Eastern Orthodox Church)|waived]].

The term "novitiate" also refers to the building, house, or complex within a [[monastery]] or [[convent]] that is devoted exclusively to the needs of novices (sleeping, training, etc.).

'''''Occult science in medicine''''' is a book by the German doctor and theosophist [[Franz Hartmann]] (1838-1912), published in 1893. The aim of the book was to raise awareness amongst doctors and medical students about valuable medical knowledge from the past that has been ignored and catalogued as occult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ''treasures of the past'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Occult science in medicine|last=Hartmann|first=Franz|publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society|year=1893|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the author is concerned with and on which he develops his argument, are mostly extracted from the work and perspective of [[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]]. On a broad level, the book is a comparison between the medical knowledge, practices and system contemporary to the author and  those predicated by [[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]] and supported by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] in general.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Additionally, an implicit underlying theme of the book is the nature of [[science]] and [[knowledge]] - the author advocates against conservative science (i.e. the paradigm within which all the scientists, and in particular medical practitioners, conduct their research or perform their job; popular and superficial science) and contrasts it with progressive science (i.e. exploring new realms of knowledge without being constrained by contemporary fashionable theories).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From a psychological perspective, there is a [[Mind–body dualism|dualistic]] representation of the mind and of the body (in accordance with [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' dualism)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meditations on First Philosophy|last=Descartes|first=René|publisher=|year=1641|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to the constitution of man, diseases and their place in contemporary medicine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Historical context ==
The book was written in the context of the author being an active member of the [[Theosophical Society]] and  a faithful adept of [[Helena Blavatsky|H.P. Blavatsky]]'s viewpoint.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theosophy.wiki/en/Franz_Hartmann|title=Franz Hartmann|last=|first=|date=|website=Theosophy Wiki|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Theosophical Society]] had significant effects on Western religion, politics, culture and society and it played a significant role in the introduction of Asian religious ideas into the Western world. Furthermore, the book was published the same year Hartmann started editing a German Theosophical monthly journal called [[Lotusblüten]] (1893-1900).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Interestingly, the book advocates for [[Mind–body dualism|dualism]] in a time when this philosophical view of the mind was perishing. During the end of the [[19th century|19th Century]], scientific knowledge was advancing fast and the [[Mind–body dualism|Mind-Body Dualism]] was being replaced by [[Materialism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This new perspective on the mind was advocated by [[Empiricism|British Empiricists]] during the 18th and 19th Century, who were carefully trying to dismiss the idea of an incorporeal, independent mind (i.e. so that they do not upset the Church) as being implausible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical and Conceptual Issues in Psychology|last=Brysbaert|first=Marc|last2=Rastle|first2=Kathy|publisher=Pearson|year=2012|isbn=978-0-273-74367-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; We are looking at a time period when people discovered that many brain processes were just reflexes&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and when [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] [[Evolutionary theory|Evolutionary Theory]] started to have great impact on [[Psychology]] and [[Philosophy]]. Notably, the principle of [[natural selection]] opposed the [[Teleology|teleological]] view of the world that was established during [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] time and further exploited by the [[Christian Church]] - this new concept had remarkable power for explaining directional and adaptive changes without the implication of a divine authority such as [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/darwins-influence-on-modern-thought/|title=Darwin's influence on modern thought|last=Mayr|first=Ernst|date=|website=Scientific American|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the body starts to be seen as a mechanical device that strives for survival and the place of the soul and immaterial substances (i.e. the mind) has no longer a place in science.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is further supported by the emergence of [[Behaviorism|Behaviourism]] (i.e. the opposing view to [[Mind–body dualism|Mind-Body Dualism]]), with its earliest derivatives traced back to the late [[19th century]] when [[Edward Thorndike]] pioneered the [[law of effect]], a process that involved strengthening behavior through the use of [[reinforcement]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Previous work ==
[[Franz Hartmann|Hartmann]]'s first work on [[Occultism]] was ''Magic, White and Black''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Magic, White and Black|last=Hartmann|first=Franz|publisher=|year=1886|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which appears to be the result of discussions with [[Helena Blavatsky|H.P. Blavatsky]];&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; this book can be considered the start of his argument for using the occult side of the nature to advance knowledge, science and medical practice.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philaletheians.co.uk/study-notes/theosophy-and-theosophists/de-zirkoff-on-franz-hartmann.pdf|title=De Zirkoff on Franz Hartmann|last=|first=|date=|website=Philaletheians|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second work was ''The life of Paracelsus and the Substance of his teachings'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The life of Paracelsus and the Substance of his teachings|last=Hartmann|first=Franz|publisher=|year=1887|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universaltheosophy.com/legacy/works/the-life-and-the-doctrines-of-paracelsus/|title=The life and the doctrines of Paracelsus|last=Hartmann|first=Franz|date=|website=Universal Theosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reveals that [[Franz Hartmann|Hartmann]] was a physician with a profound understanding of the occult philosophy od [[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These two first publications of [[Franz Hartmann|Hartmann]] can be seen as a precursor of soon to be published ''Occult science in medicine''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is an unifying account of how the occult teachings of [[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]] can be applied to attain true knowledge and advance contemporary medicine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Structure ==
The book consists of five parts, with the most general topic discussed in ''Part 1'' and the most specific points being made in ''Part 5''. Each part is structured as a comparison between contemporary knowledge, science, medicine and their occult counterpart.

Each part introduces a different topic with the heading describing what it is going to be approached:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

*''Part 1: The constitution of man''
*''Part 2: The four pillars of medicine''
*''Part 3: The five causes of disease''
*''Part 4: The five classes of physicians''
*''Part 5: The medicine of the future''

The structure being employed makes the argument easy to follow and provides it with unity by implicitly supporting the links between the different parts.

== Content ==

=== Part 1: The constitution of man ===
Given that popular science has no information about the power that drives human development, nor about the nature or the origin of the human mind, it is understandable to look into other sources of information and consider what the Ancient sages taught about the principles that govern the constitution of man.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This reasoning is employed as a justification for using occult knowledge.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical literature]] summarizes Ancient knowledge regarding the above-mentioned principles as follows - the sevenfold constitution of man:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blavatskyarchives.com/constitutionofahumanbeing.htm|title=The Sevenfold Constitution of a Human Being|last=Blavatsky|first=H.P.|date=|website=Blavatsky Study Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is highlighted how [[On Ancient Medicine|Ancient medicine]] was a religious science, recognizing the source of universal life (''Note'': The term religion does not refer to any of the existing systems of religious doctrines or forms of worship, but to the spiritual recognition of divine truth) and how popular modern medicine recognizes no real truth because it is concerned only with the lowest plane of existence (i.e. the physical body) by recognizing only the outcome of a blind force.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Medicine]] cannot be separated from religion because the essence of the human being is its divine source (i.e. highest plane of existence) and not the physical body (i.e. lowest plane of existence).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is the recurrent [[Mind–body dualism|dualistic]] presentation of the nature of man that is the basis of Hartmann's argument.

[[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]] is portrayed as the father of medicine and given as example of a physician that recognized the sevenfold constitution of man and used this knowledge to treat his patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Part 2: The four pillars of medicine ===
The pillars upon which the practice of modern medicine, which is concerned only with the external plane of existence (i.e. the physical world),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; rests:

* A knowledge of the physical body (i.e. [[Anatomy]], [[Philology]], [[Pathology]])
* Certain amount of acquaintance with physical science;
* Acquaintance with the views and opinions of modern accepted medical authorities (however erroneous they may be);
* A certain amount of judgement and aptitude to put the acquired theories into practice;.

[[Psychology]] is portrayed as a misnomer with Hartmann arguing that there can be no science of the soul as long as its existence is not acknowledged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The author is an adept of [[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]]' pillars of medicine:

*''Philosophia&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'' - it is not concerned with the [[Philosophy]] that existed at the time (i.e. logic, inferences, speculations) but a system in which there is a great deal of love for the truth (i.e. recognition of self in another form). This pillar is  based on the power of recognizing the truth in all things independent of any books or authorities. As depicted by [[Franz Hartmann|Hartmann]], this is an argument against working within a contemporary paradigm because existing theories hinder the ability to see and extract knowledge from nature. This realm of '''Philosophia''' includes all the natural sciences referring to external phenomena, but also those sciences concerned with the interior world (Note: the exterior world is a mere expression of the interior world). [[Franz Hartmann|Hartmann]] concludes with the mention that a science referring merely to the terrestrial life is not the summit of all possible knowledge, because beyond the realm of visible phenomena there is a far more extensive realm open to all who are capable of entering the realm of truth. Thus, his main poin is that contemporary medicine is good, but not enough because it is concerned only with the physical body.
*''Astronomia&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'' - in contemporary times, it is the science of celestial bodies, but in [[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]]' view, astronomy represents the various states of the mind existing in the microcosm of nature as well as in the microcosm of man. Interestingly, [[Franz Hartmann|Hartmann]] supports [[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]]' idea that man, far from creating his own thoughts, merely remodels the ideas that flow into his mind. This requires a further consideration of free will and of the amount of responsibility of man; nonetheless, the author does not extend on this idea.
*''Alchemy&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'' - his main aim regarding this topic is merely to remove existing misconceptions and to raise awareness amongst students and doctors - and maybe they will use this knowledge to attain real knowledge. [[Alchemy]] (concerned with living spiritual powers and wisdom) and [[Chemistry]] (concerned with the physical world) are depicted as being two aspects of the same science (i.e. one is the lower, and the other one is the higher part). He believes that by combining them, science will discover how life emerges from the chemical properties of the physical world.
*''The virtue of the physician&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'' - it is argued that passing an examination and obtaining the title of [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] does not make you a doctor (i.e. it is just an academical degree). The true physician is ordained by [[God]] (i.e. people cannot make someone a doctor, they can only give the right to act as one, but with no the power to heal). [[Franz Hartmann|Hartmann]]'s main point regarding this topic is best described by [[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]]' words: ''Medical wisdom is only given by God.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paragranum|last=Paracelsus|first=Theophrastus|publisher=|year=1530|isbn=|location=|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part 3: The five causes of disease ===
The classification  of the causes of disease, acknowledged by modern medical science, is an enumeration of certain conditions in which disease may arise (e.g. Age, Heredity, Temperament, Mental and moral conditions, Temperature, Epidemic disease, Contagion, Malaria etc.).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]]' classification is depicted as a better description of the causes of disease. He classifies diseases as those originating in the kingdom of matter (i.e. physical body), within the realm of the soul (i.e. energy) or in the sphere of the spirit (i.e. intelligence). As long as these three substances are in harmony with each other the individual is healthy; an imbalance will result in disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The five causes of disease advocated by [[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]] are:

* ''Ens astrale&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'' - diseases arising from external influences (i.e. surrounding conditions);&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 5, 1894|title=Occult science in medicine (Continued)|url=http://www.iapsop.com/archive/materials/light/light_v14_may_1894.pdf|journal=Light: A journal of Psychical, Occult and Mystical Research|volume=14|pages=214–215|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ens veneni&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'' - disease originating from poisonous actions and impurities in all three planes of existence;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* ''Ens naturale&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'' - diseases which have their origin in certain conditions inherent in the constitution of man (quality of body, soul and mind as they were received from nature - includes all inherited physical diseases, qualities of temperament and mental peculiarities);&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* ''Ens spirituale&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'' - diseases arising from spiritual causes (spirit = consciousness in every plane of existence). Furthermore, the spirit is depicted as having three functions: ''Will, Imagination, Memory;''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

From a psychological perspective, the three functions of the soul depicted by Hartmann represent fundamental cognitive processes. ''Will'' is presented as being distinct from the selfish desire of the brain - it is a strong power which drives all voluntary and involuntary actions in the organism of man, whether or not we are conscious of it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Imagination'' is the power of the mind to form images.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Memory'' is presented as the ability of the spirit to visit those places within the sphere of his mind where former experiences are preserved, and thus to bring them again within the field of consciousness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, it is highlighted that the brain is just an instrument for perception - thus, Hartmann advocates for a spirit/mind that interacts with the body, using it as an instrument.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* ''Ens del'' - diseases arising from eternal retribution (in the East, called the law of [[Karma]]) or the action of divine justice throughout the Universe.

=== Part 4: The five classes of physicians ===
Based on [[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]]' doctrine, the author makes a distinction between:

* Science of the lower methods (i.e. prescribing drugs, using hot/cold water, applying any other physical forces) can be taught to anybody in possession of an ordinary amount of intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Science of the higher methods (i.e. the real art of medicine) requires higher gifts that cannot be acquired in any other way than according to the law of spiritual evolution and higher development of the inner man.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Accordingly, there are lower and higher order physicians. [[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]]' five classes of physicians are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Three lower classes (they seek for resources in the material plane):
** ''Naturales'' - They employ physical remedies acting as opposites - e.g. using cold water for fever ([[Allopathic medicine|Allopaths]] - regular practitioners);
** ''Specifici'' - They use physical remedies which experience has shown to work for specific problems ( [[Empiricism|Empirics]], [[Homeopathy|Homeopaths]] - regular practitioners that have knowledge about how some remedies work in specific situations - the result of observation, and not of knowledge of the fundamental laws of nature);
** ''Characterales'' - They employ the power of the mind - act upon the will and imagination of the patients (Mind healer, [[Animal magnetism|Mesmerism]])
* Two higher classes (they employ remedies belonging to the super sensual plane):
** ''Spirituales'' - They are in possession of spiritual powers, using the magic power of their own will and thought (Magic, [[Psychometry (paranormal)|Psychometry]], [[Hypnosis|Hypnotism]], [[Spiritism]]);
** ''Fideles'' - through whom "miraculous" works are performed in the power of the true faith (Adepts).

=== Part 5: The medicine of the future ===
In the final part, the author reflects on the progress of [[science]] since the time of [[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]] and concludes that even though knowledge has been advanced, it does not mean that human kind is wiser.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He believes that more spiritual knowledge is needed in order to attain wisdom. Furthermore, in order to attain this spiritual knowledge, the author encourages his readers to get to know their constitution and the nature of the higher power that resides in them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Franz Hartmann|Hartmann]] supports [[Paracelsus|Theophrastus Paracelsus]]' view that wisdom is not the intellect of the terrestrial, but the understanding of the celestial mind.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, he encourages spiritual self-knowledge and the use of the higher order knowledge to advance the field of medicine.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Reception ==
In 1894, ''Occult science in medicine'' is seen as an important manuscript given that it provides access to the system of medicine of Paracelsus in times when materialistic empiricism in Medicine seems to approach its end while the importance of the mind (i.e. thought) is beginning to be recognized again in the cure of disease.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=April 28, 1894|title=Occult science in medicine|url=http://www.iapsop.com/archive/materials/light/light_v14_apr_1894.pdf|journal=Light: A journal of Psychical, Occult and Mystical Research|volume=14|pages=194–195|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ''The Physician of the future&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'' chapter is seen as the weakest part of the book because the priest becomes discredited as a physician.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In general, the book is seen as superior to contemporary materialistic medical science which is portrayed as being far from any intelligent appreciation of the ideas portrayed by Hartmann.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Evaluating the theosophical situation today reveals that theosophy is not dying out, but rather, experiencing a renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pedersen|first=Rene Dybdal|date=|title=Defining Theosophy in the Twenty-First Century|url=https://journal.fi/scripta/article/view/67333/27630|journal=Scripta|volume=|pages=|via=Journal.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given such circumstances, it is not surprising that Franz Hartmann's work is republished and appreciated in the 21st Century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Occult science in medicine|last=Hartmann|first=Franz|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=1993|isbn=156459355X|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Occult science in medicine|last=Hartmann|first=Franz|publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC|year=2010|isbn=1161351892|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with appreciative comments from the readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Occult-Science-Medicine-Franz-Hartmann/dp/1103788566|title=Comments from the readers - Occult science in medicine|last=|first=|date=|website=https://www.amazon.com/Occult-Science-Medicine-Franz-Hartmann/dp/1103788566|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not only the doctrine of religious and moral rights, but also the set of religious duties, social order, right conduct and virtuous things and deeds. As such Dharma is the Code of Ethics.[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Dharma] The modern use of the term can be traced to late 19th century [[Hindu reform movements]] (J. Zavos, ''Defending Hindu Tradition: Sanatana Dharma as a Symbol of Orthodoxy in Colonial India'', Religion (Academic Press), Volume 31, Number 2, April 2001, pp. 109-123; see also R. D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7326">The '''Principality of Chaghaniyan''', known in [[Arabic]] sources as '''al-Saghaniyan''', was a local [[Iranian people|Iranian]] dynasty, which ruled the [[Chaghaniyan]] region from the early 7th-century to the late 8th-century. The rulers of the region were known by their titles of “Chaghan Khudah” ([[Eastern Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]]; ''Čagīnīgān Xvaday'', meaning “the lord of Chaghaniyan”).{{cref|a}}

== History ==
[[Image:ChaghaniyanSogdiancoin.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Coin of a Chaghan Khudah or Hephthalite ruler written in [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]].]]
During the early 7th-century, Chaghaniyan became independent from [[Hephthalite]] rule, and came under the control of local rulers known as the “Chaghan Khudah”.{{sfn|Bosworth|1990|pp=614–615}} During the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], the Chaghan Khudah aided their kinsmen, the [[Sasanians]], during their struggle against the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun Arabs]]. However, the Arabs, after having dealt with the Sasanian Empire, began focusing on the local rulers of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], which included the Chaghan Khudah and many other local rulers. In 652, the Chaghan Khudah, along with the rulers of [[Taloqan|Talaqan]], [[Guzgan]], and [[Faryab]], aided the ruler of southern [[Tokharistan]] against the Arabs. Nevertheless the Arabs managed to emerge victorious during the battle. However, the Rashidun Caliphate soon fell into civil war, and was conquered by another Arab family, who founded the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. During the early 660s, the Chaghan Khudah, known as Turantash, sent an envoy under his chancellor Pukarzate to Varkhuman, the [[Sogdia]]n king of [[Samarkand]].{{sfn|Hansen|2012|p=127}}

In 705, the Arab general [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] managed to make the Chaghan Khudah, whose name is mentioned as [[Tish of Chaghaniyan|Tish]], acknowledge Umayyad authority. The real reason for Tish's submission, however, was to gain aid in defeating the local rulers of Akharun and Shuman in northern Tokharistan, who had been making incursions against him.{{sfn|Bosworth|1990|pp=614–615}}{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=32}} Qutayba shortly defeated the two rulers, and forced them to acknowledge Umayyad authority.

However, in 718, Tish, along with [[Gurak]], the king of [[Samarkand]], Narayana, the king of Kumadh, and Tughshada, the [[Bukhar Khudahs|Bukhar Khudah]] of [[Bukhara]], sent an embassy to the [[Tang dynasty]] of [[China]], where they asked for aid against the Arabs.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=60}} Nevertheless, the principality of Chaghaniyan still aided the Arabs against the [[Turgesh]], and were present at the side of the Arabs during the [[Battle of the Baggage]], where they were defeated and the Chaghan Khudah was killed. After the battle, most of Khorasan except Chaghaniyan remained under Arab control. Under [[Nasr ibn Sayyar]], Chaghaniyan was once again a vassal of the Umayyad Caliphate. After this, the Chaghan Khudahs begin to fade from the sources. In the late 8th-century Chaghaniyan fell under the direct control of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], which had succeeded the Umayyad Caliphate in 750. The [[Muhtajids]], an Iranian dynasty which in the 10th-century gained control over Chaghaniyan, may have been descended from the Chaghan Khudahs.{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764-766}}

[[File:Miyako harimizu utaki.jpg|thumb|300px|''Harimizu [[utaki]]'' (Harimizu Shrine), a Ryukyuan shrine in [[Miyakojima, Okinawa|Miyakojima]], [[Okinawa Prefecture]].]]
The '''Ryukyuan religion''', '''Ryukyu Shinto''' (琉球神道), '''Nirai Kanai Shinkou''' (ニライカナイ信仰), or '''Utaki Shinkou''' (御嶽信仰) is the indigenous [[religion|belief system]] of the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. While specific legends and traditions may vary slightly from place to place and island to island, the Ryukyuan religion is generally characterized by [[Veneration of the dead|ancestor worship]] (more accurately termed "ancestor respect") and the respecting of relationships between the living, the dead, and the gods and spirits of the natural world. Some of its beliefs, such as those concerning ''[[genius loci]]'' spirits and many other beings classified between gods and humans, are indicative of its ancient [[animism|animistic]] roots, as is its concern with {{nihongo3||まぶい|mabui}}, or life essence.

Over time, Ryukyuan religious practice has been influenced by [[religion in China|Chinese religions]] ([[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], and [[Chinese folk religion|folk beliefs]]), [[Buddhism]] and Japanese [[Shinto]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/3206 Edward E. Bollinger. ([[circa|c]]. 1965). ''The Unity of Government and Religion in the Ryukyu Islands to 1,500&amp;nbsp;A.D.'']&lt;/ref&gt; One of its most ancient features is the belief {{nihongo4||おなり神|[[onarigami]]}}, the spiritual superiority of women derived from [[Amamikyu]], which allowed for the development of a ''[[noro priestess|noro]]'' (priestess) system and a significant following for ''yuta'' (female [[Mediumship|medium]]s or shamans).

==Family-centered worship==
Ryukyuan religion, with its focus on demonstrating respect of and reverence toward ancestors, is naturally based in the family home. The oldest female relative acts as a primary celebrant, officiating rituals concerning ancestors, [[Household deity|household gods]] and those family members who live both in and outside the home. Daily incense offerings are made and prayer "reports" are delivered aloud, in which each family member is described for the benefit of the incorporeal being addressed. The oldest female relative is also responsible for cleaning and upkeep of the ''buchidan'' (ancestors altar), ''hinukan'' (hearth god and his home on the hearth), and ''furugan'' (bathroom god).

===Ancestors and their relationship to time===
The Ultimate Ancestors, those from whom all life springs, are ''Utin'' ("Heaven", the father), ''Jiichi'' ("Earth", the mother), and ''Ryuuguu'' ("Sea", the place from which we were born). They originate and exist, along with ''[[kami]]'', or the gods of the world, during the ''Usachi-yu'', the "Ancient Age". They are held in highest regard as the originators of all things and are worshiped in the community's {{nihongo4||御嶽|utaki}}. Ancestors living in the distant past, but not in the Usachi-yu – that is, ancestors living more than about 25 generations ago but not living with the gods at the beginning of time – are said to be living in ''Nakaga-yu'', the "Middle Age". These ancestors are worshipped as collective spirits called ''futuchi'' (''futuki''), whose worship is focused usually in Buddhist temples. Other, more immediate ancestors are those who lived between the present day and the twenty-fifth generation into the past, a time period called ''Ima-ga-yuu'', the "Present Age". They are those enshrined in the family home's ''buchidan'', and it is these ancestors who visit on special occasions in the home and at the ''haka'' ("family tomb", v.inf). (Matayoshi/Trafton, 39, 41)

===Butsudan===
[[File:Ryukyu Butsudan.jpg|thumb|A Ryukyuan ''butsudan''.]]
The {{nihongo4||仏壇{{lang|en| or }}ぶちだん|buchidan}} is the primary focus of ancestor worship. It is a space, usually a small closet, dedicated to the family altar and various memorial plaques featuring the names of ancestors. Incense and alcohol are offered to ancestors at the butsudan. In the Ryukyus the ''buchidan'' or {{nihongo3|literally "Buddha Shelf"|仏壇|[[butsudan]]}} does not house a statue of Buddha but memorial tablets inscribed with the names of the family ancestors. The butsudan is placed in a room called the {{nihongo3|literally "first seat" and this room also serves as the guest room|一座|ichibanza}}. The practice of placing ancestral tablets in the ''butsudan'' is believed to derive from the influence of Confucianism.

The ''butsudan'' is passed from generation to generation, first son to first son and only those who have inherited the parental house and carried on the main line possess a ''butsudan''. The ''butsudan'' serves as the family gathering place on special holidays, e.g., New Year's and [[Obon]]. Normally the butsudan receives offerings of incense, tea, water and cooked rice. During festivals the ''butsudan'' is lavishly adorned with offerings of pineapple, mango, apples, tangerines, exotic tropical fruits, sugar cane, and rice cakes. During these times, families may occasionally offer alcohol in the form of sake or awamori.

===Hinukan===
The ''hinukan'' is a [[Household deity|hearth god]], represented by three small stones and usually located in the kitchen.  As his name suggests, he is essentially a fire god, but more specifically is the guardian of the "family fire"; his worship is officiated by the family matriarch.  A community hinukan, by extension, is the guardian of sacred communal fire; his worship is officiated by the community priestess (''noro'', v. inf).  The hinukan, while he inhabits the family home, doesn't call it his own home, and in fact leaves to return to his home to celebrate the solar New Year (v.inf.). He may be compared with [[Kamui Fuchi]], hearth goddess of the [[Kamuy|Ainu Religion]].

===Fuuru nu Kami===
The ''fuuru nu kami'', or "[[toilet god|god of the toilet]]", is the family protector of the area of waste. [[Pig toilet|The pig toilet]], lacking this benevolent god, could become a place of evil influence and potential haunting (such as by an ''[[akaname]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.obakemono.com/obake/akaname/|title=obakemono.com -  Resources and Information.|website=www.obakemono.com|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other negative spirits, welcomed by the accumulation of waste matter, rejected and abandoned by the human body).  Because he is considered a primary household god, the ''fuuru nu kami's'' habitat (the bathroom) is kept clean and is perceived to warrant deferential behavior. Reports on the family's status are delivered regularly to the ''fuuru nu kami''. He shares traits with the Korean bathroom goddess, [[Cheukshin]].

==At the tomb==
[[File:kamekoubaka.jpg|thumb|300px|A ''haka'', or family tomb, of the [[turtle-back tombs|turtle-back variety]].]]
Traditionally, periodic gatherings of the extended family occur at the family ''haka'', or "tomb" ([[Ryukyuan religion#Religious calendar|v. inf.]] for information concerning the traditional dates of these gatherings).  The tombs resemble houses, complete with a courtyard (''naa''), family name markers, and "porch" upon which offerings are arranged. A common tomb style in many areas is the so-called turtle-back tomb (''kamekokata''), whose roof is shaped as the [[carapace]] of a tortoise.&lt;ref name=kabira&gt;{{citation|title=The Culture of Kabira, Southern Ryūkyū Islands|author= Allan H. Smith|journal= Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=104|issue=2 |date=Apr 19, 1960|pages=134–171 |jstor=985656}} (pp. 170-171).&lt;/ref&gt; These tombs have variously been described as "horseshoe-shaped" or "[[omega]]-shaped" tombs by Westerners, but Okinawans believe they are shaped like a [[Uterus|womb]]; the dead "return to the source".&lt;ref&gt;Glacken, Clarence. ''The Great Loochoo: A Study of Okinawan Village Life''. University of California Press, Berkley, 1955. Page 246–247.&lt;/ref&gt; Another very common type is the gable tomb (''hafukokata''), which appears like a small Okinawan house. Though not ''haka'', the royal tombs of the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]] are located at [[Tamaudun]].

Inside the tomb is stored the cremated remains (''funishin'') of several generations of family members. Especially important is the thirty-third year after a relative's death; at this point, the deceased individual is believed to have taken their place with all their ancestors in the afterlife. During a typical extended family gathering at the tomb, incense, food, offering, and prayers are offered to ancestors, and then a picnic is enjoyed by those in attendance. Although responsibilities may vary on a case-by-case basis, generally it is the oldest male of a family whose financial responsibility is upkeep for existing tombs and establishment of new tombs if anything should happen to the old, including becoming too full.

Various [[taboo]]s exist in relation to the tomb.  It is rude to point at a tomb, speak loudly concerning the dead around a tomb, or take pictures of a tomb without expressed permission.  It is considered dangerous to desecrate a tomb with graffiti, by disturbing offerings such as flowers, or by damaging the tomb in any way.  Also considered dangerous may be to approach a tomb without proper authority (such as relation to the family) or to visit a tomb at night.

==Other gods, goddesses, and spirits==
The most-often worshiped gods are undoubtedly those of the home; however, especially powerful deities are revered by the community as a whole, and certain legendary creatures exist who are not worshiped, but are respected.

===Community worship===
[[File:Utaki.JPG|thumb|300px|A model ''utaki'' set up near Motobu in Okinawa.]]
Community worship most often involves that of marine and mountain deities, who determine the success of agricultural, shipping/trade, and fishing pursuits. Community worship also includes [[chthonic]] spirits inhabiting rocks, trees, caves, and springs, who are respected with deference in their province (such as by not moving the rock, harming the tree, or entering the grove/cave) and receive offerings.

Especially old or powerful ancestors act as local deities and inhabit an ''utaki'', or "sacred place". This is usually a grove, a spring, or a cave located near the village, entrance to which is sometimes restricted and sanctity of which is always respected. The most sacred spot in an utaki is the ''ibi'' and the area around it (the ''ibi nu mae''). Only the ''noro'' may enter the ''ibi'' to make offerings and prayers on the ''ibi nu mae''.&lt;!-- Commented out because it's a picture, can't we get a proper reference?&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/Utakiinfo.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Examples of famous ''utaki'' are ''[[Sefa-utaki]]'' (the most sacred official place in the Ryūkyū Kingdom).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/002/001/e_sef.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110184515/http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/002/001/e_sef.html |archivedate=2005-11-10 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Legend has it that the goddess Amamikyu(天久神), who gave birth to the islands of the Ryukyus, descended here. From this sacred grove, people prayed to Kudaka Island, [[Okinawa]]'s most sacred place. Once the inaugurations of the high priestess of the [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] Court, ''kikoe-ōgimi'', took place there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/002/001/e_sef.html Gusuku Site and the Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110184515/http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/002/001/e_sef.html |date=2005-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned, Kudaka Island is the site of many ''utaki''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://okinawahai.com/kudaka-island/|title=Kudaka Island – Okinawa Hai|date=2013-06-10|work=Okinawa Hai|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other especially sacred places in and around Okinawa include the area around [[Nakijin gusuku|Nakijin Castle]] and ''Gusukuyama'' (or ''Tacchu''), a high, steep peak on [[Ie-shima]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/007/english/point/ie/siroyama/index.html Gusukuyama (Ijimatacchu)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208034640/http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/007/english/point/ie/siroyama/index.html |date=2005-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line between ''kami'', ancestors, and other spirits may be faint in community ancestor worship, such as when especially ancient ancestors are worshipped as with the same respect as other, never-corporeal ''kami''. This is because "kami" is a broad term, meaning not only "god" but less specifically "concentration of spiritual energy"; thus, in the example of the especially ancient ancestors, they are treated as ''kami'' because of their power. Also, when a ''noro'' assumes the form of a god, she becomes the locus of this great energy, and thus is a ''kami''. (Sered)

===Negative spirits===
Negative spirits in Okinawa are often referred to as "[[ghost]]s" in English, although they are not necessarily "ghosts" in the Western sense of the world (wandering souls of the dead). Those believed to visibly appear are usually the spirits of those who met especially horrible end or those who didn't receive proper funerary rites. As [[World War II]] [[Battle of Okinawa|fighting in Okinawa]] was particularly protracted and heavy, there are many tales of ghosts and haunted places with military-related origin stories. Other negative spirits are incorporeal chthonic beings classifiable between spirits of the dead and gods.

Negative spirits are believed to be irritated or angered by human presence. Negative spirits are responsible for accidents, illnesses, and deaths befalling those who have had contact with their habitation. Thus even today, haunted places are especially sacrosanct, to the point that many people refuse to develop perfectly suited properties or live next to beautiful areas because they have been judged to be inhabited by a negative spirit. An especially famous example of this is the half-finished [[Nakagusuku Hotel ruins]] that stand within walking distance from [[Nakagusuku Castle]] in [[Kitanakagusuku]], which was abandoned during its construction as the result of several deaths both on- and off-site and still stands as it was; most Okinawan people will not go near the hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stumpyjoe.com/okinawaArchive/oct.html|title=October - Motels, Hotels, and Other Spooky Things|website=www.stumpyjoe.com|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Places are determined to be haunted if people in contact with the areas encounter severe misfortunes. In this case, a ''yuta'', or several ''yuta'', are usually contracted to contact the offended spirit and determine both how the offending individual can recompensate for their trespass, and whether or not the spirit can be brought to terms with the aims of the individual for the spirit's area. Though the spirit can almost always be pacified, it many times cannot accept the disturbance of its space, and thus the area is marked by the community as forbidden territory for development or travel. A ''yuta'', a Buddhist monk, or a Shinto priest may be called upon to banish the spirit.

===Magical creatures===
[[File:Shisa.jpg|thumb|upright|A shisa statue placed on a roof.]]
The ''[[kijimuna]]a'' (or ''bunagaya'') is one of the most famous of Okinawa's magical creatures.  A [[sprite (creature)|sprite]] (Japanese ''[[yōsei]]''), the kijimunaa resembles a short young boy and features bright red hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.obakemono.com/obake/kijimunaa/|title=obakemono.com -  Resources and Information.|website=www.obakemono.com|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They look somewhat like a [[Troll doll]]. Some say that only children or the pure of heart can see the kijimunaa.  They may or may not be seen accompanied by fire.  They live in the tops of Okinawa's ''gajumaru'' (ガジュマル, "[[banyan]]") trees; they are especially famous in the [[Yomitan]] area, where their images can be seen in many places.  Kijimunaa are known for playing harmless pranks.  Kijimunaa can also be helpful, but they are quick to change their minds.  They enjoy fishing and eating fish.  The only thing they fear is the octopus.  Belief in kijimunaa is representative of the spiritual power of trees in the Ryukyu belief system.

Another of the most famous Ryukyuan creatures is the ''[[shisa]]'' ("lion dog").  Shisa statuary is used for its ability to ward evil from a place.  Its appearance and function is Chinese in origin.

Representative of the power of the sea are dragons, who often make appearances in Ryukyuan legend.  In the ''Irosetsuden'', for instance, dragons display powers like those of gods, and live in their own undersea kingdom.  The traditional Ryukyuan conception of dragon is largely similar to that of [[Dragon King|China]], though myths concerning an undersea kingdom of powerful reptilian beings are common to Central and East Asian cultures (see [[Reptilian humanoid#Mythology|Reptilian humanoids in mythology]]).

==Mabui==
{{nihongo4||まぶい|Mabui}}, or "spirit", is a key concept in Ryukyuan religion.  Mabui is the essence of the [[self (psychology)|self]], somewhat like the [[soul]] and somewhat like [[mana]].  Just as the soul in many traditions is immortal, so is mabui; also like the soul, one's mabui is one's defining characteristic, unique to the individual.  The mabui of a dead person may cling to a living person, requiring a ritual of separation (''mabui-wakashi'') or a conveyance from the place of death to a proper resting place (''suukaa'').  In a case of sudden death, an especially complicated ritual takes place in order to separate the mabui from where it is clinging (as though it still lived) and move it to where it can find rest.

Like mana, mabui is transferable by contact:  if a person is left their grandmother's wedding ring, that ring – as an effect often in contact with the grandmother and only the grandmother – will have taken on the mabui of the grandmother.  One's likeness, whether rendered by photograph or any other medium, also contains one's mabui.  Due to their young age, the mabui of children is not as attached to their physical body as that of old people.

Mabui can leave the body, resulting in {{nihongo3|"lost mabui"|まぶいうとぅし|mabui-utushi}} with various physical results.  The 2002 Okinawan film ''Hotel Hibiscus'' portrays many traditional Ryukyuan beliefs; among them, that of the loss of mabui.  In the film, a young girl named Meiko loses her mabui after a fight with her father and a peaceful encounter with the ghost of her dead aunt.  She becomes unresponsive, only coming out of her trance-like state to talk again with her dead aunt.  This portrayal of the loss of mabui is somewhat accurate.

Mabui can be lost as the result of fright, stress, loneliness, or helplessness, any circumstances in which a person suffers from a sudden shock or a lack of psychological/physical resources.  A coma-like trance is one manifestation of the loss of mabui, but an extreme one.  It seems that the loss of one's mabui manifests itself first psychologically, as depression or anxiety, and then physically as general lethargy or actual illness.  Poor relationships – be they with the living, the dead, or incorporeal powers – also may result in the loss of mabui.

Two rituals are performed in relation to mabui:  ''mabui-gumi'' if one has lost their mabui, and ''uchatou-mintou'' to stave off mabui loss.  All prayers are offered aloud.

===Mabui-gumi===
Performed as the result of the loss (or potential loss) of mabui.  After being startled, while scared, or even after a sneeze, one says or has recited over them "''Mabuya, mabuya, utikuyou''" or simply "''Mabuya, mabuya''".  One can also regain one's lost mabui simply by doing what one habitually does:  sitting in one's favorite chair, sleeping in one's own bed, wearing favorite old clothing, or handling familiar, personal objects. More formally, a special ceremony can be performed by the family's matriarch at the place of supposed loss of the mabui.  First, prayers are addressed to ancestors and household gods at the home, and then the place of supposed loss is visited.  A fruit offering, an incense offering, and prayers of thanks are all addressed to ancestors.  Then three stones from the place are tied up in clothing worn during the loss, and the matriarch returns home to make an offering of the three stones and a special meal of rice balls to the ancestors.

If the case is especially serious, a ''yuta'' (v.inf.) may be involved in the retrieval of one's mabui.

===Uchatou-mintou===
This daily ritual prevents loss of mabui, as well as prevents possession by foreign spirits, or ''kakaimun''.  It involves a morning offering of water and tea to household gods, along with prayers for a safe and easy day.  In the evening, prayers are offered that describe the good works and characteristics of all family members.  Incense is usually offered as well.

==Kaminchu==
''Kaminchu'' (or ''kamigutsu'', {{nihongo2|神人}}, {{nihongo2|かみんちゅ}}, "god people") are people specializing in Ryukyuan [[Magic and religion#Related Religious practices|magico-religious practices]], usually those involving incorporeal beings. Their social roles correspond to those of a [[shamanism|shaman]] in that, depending upon their classification, they serve as [[medium (spirituality)|mediums]], especially influential [[prayer]] and offering performers, [[Faith healing|healer]]s/guardians, [[precognition|precognosticators]]/[[fortune-telling|fortune-tellers]]/[[divination|diviners]], and sources of [[mediation]] both within the living community and between material and immaterial beings.  Although they may assist in the transference of the mabui of the deceased, they do not act as [[psychopomp]]s, because they do not help guide a spirit out of this world and into the afterlife.

In the [[Okinawan language]], ''shiji'' means the ability to sense, communicate with, and direct the power of ancestors gods.&lt;ref name="wonder-okinawa1"&gt;http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/022/en/study/022_e49.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although men may display some of these abilities and often assist in rituals, women are the primary interlocutors between humans and spirits or gods in the Ryukyuan religion, therefore are highly respected.

===Noro/Nuuru priestesses===
{{main|Noro (priestess)}}
The ''noro'' or ''nuuru'' priestesses are the oldest ''kaminchu'' in the Ryukyu Islands. They communicate with, make offerings to, and, at times, [[channeling (mediumistic)|channel]] ancestors, local gods and more powerful deities.  Their primary duty is to officiate at communitywide (that is, "official") festivals and rituals.&lt;ref name="wonder-okinawa1"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=January 2018}} These rituals take place in a sacred space, usually in a grove (or ''ong''), at a cave or by the sea. Men were forbidden to enter these sacred spaces ([[Ryukyuan religion#Community worship|v.s.]] for more information concerning community worship). Another of their primary functions was the protection and fueling of the communal fire, which was used to establish new households.

The ''noro'' also would perform divination to determine the best days for sacred ceremonies, for social functions such as marriage or funeral, and for agricultural pursuits (Kerr 33). Land was set aside for the use of the ''noro'', who when local was called ''niigami'' and was the sister of the ''nitchu'', the head of the oldest (or, later, most powerful) family in the community (called ''niiya''). The ''noro'' was expected to remain a virgin. She was aided in her sacerdotal duties by a girl from every household in the community. The symbols of the ''noro'' are her white vestments and beads, often including a sacred, comma-shaped stone, the ''magatama''.

On smaller islands, idiosyncratic ''noro'' traditions persist. On Kudaka, for instance, people believe in a "priesthood of all women", and all women serve the gods from age 31 to age 70. Their [[initiation]] rites, ''[[Izaiho]]'', was held every twelve years, and women were initiated between ages 31 and 40. Due to the absence of women of the representing age the last Izaiho was held in 1978.

According to George Kerr in his ''Okinawa:  the History of an Island People'', the ''noro'' was at one time a priestess-queen, wielding both political and spiritual power within her community. Chinese records of the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty described the political power of the ''noro'' in much the same way Caesar described that of the Druids:  influence over spiritual powers was used to wield judicial and martial influence over men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Caesar/gallic.6.6.html Caesar 6.13–14], Kerr 31&lt;/ref&gt; One ''noro'', [[Pimeku]], even attempted to forge a kingdom of independent islands (Kerr 31). The Ryukyu Islands are described as queen islands in [[Nihonshiki|Japanese records]] as well. Gradually, however, the ''noro's'' role as ritual leader and religious consultant became independent of her role as political leader, perhaps as the result of sharing more and more power with her male relatives in order to deal with an increasing demand for her ritual services.

The ''noro'' became more priestess than queen, though they still possessed some measure of political influence, as they eventually came to wield royally sanctioned religious authority through appointments first begun by the [[History of Ryukyu Islands|Ryūkyū king]] [[Shō Shin]] (Kerr 110). These appointments were primarily from local powerful families, to serve at their local sacred sites throughout the main island of Okinawa; this system of appointment also served [[Miyako-jima|Miyako Island]] and the [[Yaeyama Islands]]. The system was an attempt to bring under royal control the autonomous centers of power that were the ''noro'' priestesses. The association of the ''noro'' with political power persisted even until the late 19th century in the outer islands (Kerr 32).

''Noro'' today can be seen on Okinawa at many festivals, most notably in Shioya&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/022/en/022_e08.html Festivals and Rituals Of Okinawa – Shioya's Ungami Ritual (Unjami)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228210513/http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/022/en/022_e08.html |date=2005-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Ogimi Village and Iheya&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/025/en/card/5-10-2.html MACHINAMI : Iheya Island]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228185721/http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/025/en/card/5-10-2.html |date=2005-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the ''Ungami''/''Unjami'' festivals of July (Lunar Calendar).

===Yuta===
&lt;!-- ''N.B.:  Some of the information in the section may come from a non-scholarly source (''The Shaman of Okinawa vs. the Gospel'', v.inf. for bibliographic information); every effort has been made to only include scholarly information quoted in the non-scholarly source.'' --&gt;
Yuta (''sanjinsou'', "tremblers"; [[Yonaguni language|Yonaguni]] ''monoshiri'', "one who knows"; [[Miyako language|Miyako]] ''kamigakariya'', "one who acts as a home for the gods") are individuals who claim to possess an especially strong ability to communicate with the dead. The name "yuta" was originally pejorative, derived from ''tokiyuta'', or "one who deceived";{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} indeed, since the establishment of a united Ryūkyū Kingdom, their practices have been discouraged and repressed.  They are employed in response to psychic disturbance or the possibility thereof.&lt;ref name="wonder-okinawa1"/&gt;

Whereas the noro is the official spiritual guide of the whole community, the yuta deals personally with families and individual paying clients to determine what spiritual circumstances have brought about or will bring about good or ill.  They also see, channel, and communicate with the spirits of the dead in order to find out what is necessary to establish harmony in the lives of their clients.  Because of this ability to interact with ancestors and solve daily problems, the yuta is probably the most influential of the kaminchu today, someone to be respected and somewhat feared.&lt;ref name="wonder-okinawa1"/&gt;  The yuta ability to channel the spirits of the recently dead, ''kuchiyose'' or ''migusou'', is especially painful to her; however, this is one of their most common activities, as it is messages from and needs of the most recently dead that are often of greatest concern.

95% of yuta are women, according to Matayoshi/Trafton in their book, ''Ancestors Worship''.  They use certain rituals, dream analysis, and knowledge of case history in combination with contact with spirits.  They often act as counselor, solving intra-family problems that may be generations old by talking with family members both living and dead to find the roots of issues.  These issues can range from a child's poor school performance due to lack of parental attention, to an individual's alcoholism being the psychological result of the neglect of certain ancestors.  Yuta also possess the ability to call and banish spirits, and thus are employed in cases of clinging or angry spirits ("hauntings" or "curses").  Many may possess the power to predict disasters such as earthquakes and typhoons, or may display other powers, such as healing or divining the location of wells or lost/stolen objects.

Yuta receive their calling through the experience of mental and physical conditions known as ''kami-daari''. The typical disorders of ''kami-daari'' include a variety ailments from loss of appetite to hematemisis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Allen, Matthew. "Therapies of Resistance? Yuta, Help-Seeking, and Identity in Okinawa (Book)." ''Critical Asian Studies'', vol. 34, no. 2, June 2002, pp. 221-242. EBSCO''host'', doi:10.1080/14672710220146215.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While experiencing the symptoms of ''kami-daari'', the soon-to-be yuta visits an usagiya, sanjinsou, or an practicing yuta to confirm that their symptoms are truly ''kami-daari''. If she is confirmed to be experiencing ''kami-daari'', she begins her journey to priestesshood. However, not all of those who experience ''kami-daari'' seek help from local shamans or priestesses. If she does not seek priestesshood and perform her ritual duties, it is thought that she will never be freed from her sufferings caused by ''kami-daari'', become insane, as well as call misfortunes to her family and self. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Naka|first=Koichi|last2=Toguchi|first2=Seijun|last3=Takaishi|first3=Toshihiro|last4=Ishizu|first4=Hiroshi|last5=Sasaki|first5=Yuji|title=Yuta (Shaman) and Community Mental Health on Okinawa|journal=International Journal of Social Psychiatry|volume=31|issue=4|pages=267–273|doi=10.1177/002076408503100404|pmid=4077426|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The abilities to interact with the dead and solve family problems are discovered or developed through this trauma.  Problems may also arise through the rejection of the call to be a yuta; these are called ''tatari'' ("punishments"), the period of suffering during which a yuta discovers the spirits which have called her into service.  Yuta may emphasize various Buddhist beliefs, such as that of not being able to call forth those spirits who have obtained Buddhahood.

In ''Religion and Folklore of Okinawa'', Kanhan Teruya divides yuta into various categories.  Three are yuta dealing with spirits from the "Present Age" (v.s.), those dealing with ancestors who died in the "Middle Age", and those dealing with gods and Ultimate Ancestors.  Some yuta are ''gamu mawari senmon'', or those concerned with the use of caves.  Some only arbitrate or advise.  Also, yuta tend to either perform rituals anytime they are needed, or use only the [[Chinese zodiac]] days of the [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]] or [[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]]. (Teruya 255–256; quoted after Bollinger)

===Others===
Other classes of people wielding spiritual power in the Ryukyu Islands include the ''ukuri'', or family priest/priestess; the ''usagiyaa'', a prayer specialist aiding in the disorders of ''kami-daari'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (though lacking the power of the yuta or noro); and "book people" (''shimuchi''), various kinds of fortune-tellers that usually refer to charts and published interpretations of signs.  Yuta and shimuchi may keep a ''suumun'', a special box in which their fortune-telling guides are kept.  Somewhat less important are Buddhist and Shinto clergy, who are generally only consulted for weddings, funerals, or on certain holidays associated with those religions (such as solar New Year activities).  In the case of weddings, even Christian clergy may be called upon to officiate. Viewing of or participation in rituals may be forbidden to outsiders.

== Ijun ==
Ijun is an Okinawan New Religion that was founded in 1972 by Takayasu Rokuro. The Ijun religion has established churches on the islands of Okinawa, Miyako, Honshu, Taiwan, and Hawaii with an estimated ten thousand followers. The main deity of Ijun is called ''Kinmanmon''. This deity communicated with Takayasu as a voice and identified itself as the primary deity of the universe, establishing all other deities as manifestations of ''Kinmanmon''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Reichl, Christopher A. “The Okinawan New Religion Ijun: Innovation and Diversity in the Gender of the Ritual Specialist.” ''Japanese Journal of Religious Studies'', vol. 20, no. 4, 1993, pp. 311–330. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/30233504.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender Dynamics ===
Like other Ryukyuan religions, Ijun began as a religion focused on female-centered leadership within the church. However, in 1989, it was decided that these role were more suited for men. By 1992, men had completely replaced women in their leadership roles, and women were placed in subordinate roles: maintaining the hearth, child rearing, etc. Takayasu explained that there are a few reasons for this: the church would not prosper if it did not adhere to the male-dominant society; Ijun might seem like a “women’s only” club, as a majority of the members and leaders were women; and childbearing would prevent women from performing their ritual duties. The Ijun branch on the island of Hawaii (est. 1989) is dominated by female leaders, forgoing the stringent, male-dominant practices of all other branches. The leaders of the Ijun church explain that this is appropriate because the female deity Pele is considered the Hawaiian incarnation of Kinmanmon. Takayasu stated that he sees this gender segregation within the church as necessary, but does not intend for it to last forever. He has also expressed a want to create co-gender ritual leading teams.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Rise of Catholicism ==
The 1950s saw a rise in Catholic missionary activity in the Ryukyuan islands, resulting in a high conversion rate amongst the Ryukyuan people. The ratio of conversion to Catholicism in the Ryukyuan islands became the highest among the Japanese Prefectures at the time. This was made possible by the blending of existing Ryukyuan religious practices and Christian themes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anzai|first=Shin|title=Newly-adopted religions and Social Change on the Ryukyu Islands (Japan)|journal=Social Compass|volume=23|issue=1|pages=57–70|doi=10.1177/003776867602300104|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Catholicism has seen a decline in influence within the islands in response to growing competition with New Religions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

==Religious calendar==
{{Main|Ryukyuan festivals and observances}}
Most Ryukyuan festivals, observances and rituals are held on dates decided by the [[lunar calendar]]. Festivals common to Japan, like Obon, are held, along with those that are uniquely Ryukyuan.

==Ryukyuan mythos==

===Nirai Kanai===
{{Redirect|Nirai Kanai}}
Nirai Kanai is the mythical place from which all life originates.  It is worshipped facing eastward, and is fabled to be Kudaka Island. Gods from Nirai Kanai are said to have brought different crops and tools to the Ryukyuan people at different times. "Nirai Kanai" is referred to in the ''Irosetsuden'' as the underwater realm of the Dragon or Sea King ([[Ryūgū-jō|Ruuguu]]).

===Ryukyuan creation myth===
According to ''[[Chūzan Seikan]]'', the Heavenly Emperor (天帝), who lived in the Heavenly [[Gusuku]] (天城), ordered Amamikyu (阿摩美久) to create the Ryukyu Islands. She descended to Earth on the spot of Sefa-utaki, and later built [[Tamagusuku Castle]] and [[Chinen Castle]]. Without sexual intercourse, she became pregnant by Shinerikyu, her male counterpart, and populated the islands. Some generations later, a "heavenly grandchild" named Tentei was born, who split Ryukyuan society into five classes with his three sons and two daughters: the first son was [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#Tenson Dynasty|Tenson]], who became the first King of Ryukyu; the second son became the first [[Anji (Ryukyu)|Aji]]; the third son became the first farmer; the first daughter became the first royal noro priestess; and the second daughter became the first village noro priestess.&lt;ref&gt;Glacken, Clarence. ''The Great Loochoo''. University of California Press, 1955. Pp 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Practice==
Okinawa Prefecture is one of the leading prefectures of psychological disorders in Japan.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1972 Okinawa was introduced to modern psychological practice. The psychological world initially rejected shamanism, but the increase in pro-Okinawan mentality among the people prompted a coexistence between the practices in society. Although shamans and doctors work to separate their practices from each other, Okinawan citizens utilize both services to find a central ground between spiritual and scientific realms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Objects of power==
Various objects of power exist for Ryukyuan people; [[amulet]]s are called ''munnukimun''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/011/english/roots/okinawa/ro05/ro05.html Okinawa Shisa Travelogue]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060407062726/http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/011/english/roots/okinawa/ro05/ro05.html |date=2006-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the most commonly seen are those purchased at Shinto shrines, such as charms for luck and safety.  Others are of indigenous Ryukyu significance.

*''Sangwaa'' (''susuki'', or knotted grass).  According to legend, an old fisherman in northern Okinawa returned home one night with a big bag of fish.  He cooked his supper, but ghosts appeared and put their hands all in his food; when he began to eat it, he had terrible [[diarrhea]].  This happened night after night, until he created a ''san'' or ''sangwaa'', twisted pieces of grass tied into a knot in the middle.  The ghosts wouldn't touch the food protected by this item, and he could enjoy his food in peace.  Even today, this object can be seen employed in various ways as a ward against evil or, in the case of offerings, food rot. (''Okinawa Folk Stories'', 46–54)
*Ishiganto are talismanic stone tablets that are strategically placed in certain locations to ward off evil or unwanted spirits. They are almost always rectangle in shape with the writing inscribed vertically.  In rare cases you will see the rectangular stone placed horizontally along with the inscription as well.  The  origin derived from China where they were most commonly placed at four way intersections, T-intersections, and dead end roads. These spirits are believed to only be able to move in a straight line or along roads. Legend gives the original purpose of it was to keep out evil spirits since they supposedly were unable to negotiate the turn. (Steiner, 1947)  Houses positioned at the end of roads or corners of intersections will mostly likely have an ishiganto there in order to stop these spirits from walking straight into a house. Many houses will still have an ishiganto even if they are not located on a T-intersection or four-way intersection.  In Okinawa houses traditionally have a low wall surrounding the entire property approximately the height of a man’s chest to protect it from the prevalent typhoon winds and to give general security. The entrance to the house additionally had another small wall called a “himpun” to prevent people looking directly into the establishment. The break in the low wall to enter the property near the entrance to the house is where the ishiganto would traditionally be placed. (Takahashi &amp; Matsui, 2011)
The origins of this custom are not clearly pinpointed in history however; Ishiganto dating back to year 770 in China have been discovered during the reign of the Emperor of the Tang Dynasty.  Based on this information it is generally accepted that the practice of using ishiganto spread throughout China during the late eighth century.  The best guestimate researchers today have is the ishiganto was introduced to the RyuKyu kingdom during the middle of the fifteenth century.  It then later spread to Japan at the end of the sixteenth century  all the way north as far as Aomori, Akita, and Hokkaido.   (Takahashi &amp; Matsui, 2011)

Ishiganto are extremely prevalent in the RyuKyu archipelago.  The largest numbers of these stone tablets are located on the main island of Okinawa. Generally older traditional ishiganto in Okinawa are place 20-30 centimeters off the ground. This is done to ward off evil spirits that enter the area by crawling on the ground.  Presently it is not uncommon to see an ishiganto embedded in the middle to upper part of a wall.  Kikai-jima (island) is known to have a triangular like font that is very comparable to a Japanese chess game called shogi. Today ishiganto are still being made and are in demand. There are stone companies on Okinawa that still make a traditional ishiganto.  Other versions of these tablets are sold on line in a much cheaper fashion and are generally mass-produced. (Takahashi &amp; Matsui, 2011)

'''Shakdvipa''', also called '''Shwetadvipa''', is mystical island in the Hindu religion.  Shakdvipa is surrounded by the sea of whey ({{lang-sa|शाक्द्वीप}})  with an extent of thirty-two [[lakh]] [[Yojan]]s. 

According to (surviving) Hindu traditions, Shakdvipa is a region in the Universe (Cosmos), that lies to the south of the 'Sea of Salt', which in turn, lies South of the Earth-plane. The island has a huge tree of Shaka, hence its name. The tree is said to have a sweet fragrance, the whole island emits a pleasant scent. The mythical ruler of this island, Medhatithi, was a son of Priyvrata.  Priyvrata is a mythical king, he was a devoted Hindu who was famous because he was married and religious.  Medhatihi, the king of Shakdvipa, had seven sons- Purojav, Manojav, Pawamana, Dhumranik, Chitraref, Bahurup and Vishwdhar. They were made the rulers of the seven divisions of the island. People of the island use Pranayama to weaken their [[Rajas|Rajoguna]] and [[Tamas (philosophy)|Tamoguna]].  These people are said to worship [[Hari]] (Vishnu) in [[Vayu]] (form) through meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavad Gita (5.20.3-42)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stieblach.JPG|thumb|right|250px|"Shtibelekh" in [[Katamon]], [[Jerusalem]]]]
A '''shtiebel''' ({{Lang-yi|שטיבל}} ''shtibl'', pl. ''shtiblekh'' or shtiebels, meaning "little house" or "little room") is a place used for communal Jewish prayer. In contrast to a formal [[synagogue]], a shtiebel is far smaller and approached more casually. It is typically as small as a room in a private home or a place of business which is set aside for the express purpose of prayer, or it may be as large as a small-sized synagogue. It may or may not offer the communal services of a synagogue.

Traditional shtiebels are not only a place for [[daven|prayer]], but also a place for community gathering. Due to the prominence of a Hasidic [[rebbe]], the shtiebel served as a medium for being near to him. A shtiebel would be host to the [[Seudah Shlishit]], the ritual third meal of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]].The shtiebel attracted newcomers through the inviting atmosphere it created by allowing prayer, eating, drinking, and community activities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stampfer|first=Shaul|date=2013-12-01|title=How and Why Did Hasidism Spread?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10835-013-9186-6|journal=Jewish History|language=en|volume=27|issue=2-4|pages=201–219|doi=10.1007/s10835-013-9186-6|issn=0334-701X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shtiebels were common in Jewish communities in Eastern Europe before [[the Holocaust]]. The shtiebel was distinctly characteristic of Hasidic Judaism and played a central and critical role in the life of the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It continues to exist in contemporary [[Israel]] and the [[United States]].

The shtiebel was cost effective and assisted in the spread of Hasidism through a grassroots movement where individuals previously exposed to Hasidism could establish one in their local community. This characteristic of the shtiebel allowed for Hasidism to reach more communities on the local and regional level throughout the 18th and 19th Century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 
In Israel, [[minyan]]s are held in storefront ''shtiebelekh'' in major business areas around the clock; whenever ten men show up, a new minyan begins. The Zichron Moshe shtiebel in the [[Zikhron Moshe]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]] (near [[Geula]]) is located in a proper [[synagogue]], with many rooms for round-the-clock minyans. This shtiebel is well known as the locale of Friday-night [[musar movement|mussar]] talks which Rabbi [[Sholom Schwadron]], the "[[Maggid]] of Jerusalem," delivered for more than 40 years.

'''''The Occult History of the Third Reich''''', narrated by [[Patrick Allen]] and directed by [[Dave Flitton]], is a 1991 four-part [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] regarding the [[occult]] influences and history of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[German empire|early 20th century Germany]].

==Contents==
The documentary was originally shown and released in four parts in 1991.
*Adolf Hitler
*The SS Blood and Soil
*The Enigma of the Swastika
*Himmler the Mystic

==Television and DVD release==
Following broadcast, it was subsequently re-released on DVD in 1998 by [[Madacy]] [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/6305247722] and again in 2004 in four parts by [[Pagasus]] [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0002XOZLU].

==Synopsis==
The documentary contains mainly black and white as well as some color archival footage, with narration explaining the influences of alternative belief systems (occult, paganism, mysticism, etc.) on the [[Nazi]] ideology and [[Hitler]]'s personal philosophy. It also documents the history and development of ideas and symbols and of the [[eugenics]] movement.

In the early 20th century, the young Adolf Hitler was just one of many German-speaking people attracted by a new [[Germanic mythology]] that combined ancient legends and esoteric cosmologies with cutting-edge theories of genetic science. In the hands of the Nazis, the result was a new ideology that saw racial purity as the key to human destiny.

This was a belief-system of arcane rituals and potent symbols, with the ancient swastika appropriated for the Nazi cause. By the time of the [[Third Reich]], Hitler and the Nazis had evolved an entirely new faith, complete with holy book, venerated relics, and a priestly elite in the form of [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]]'s [[SS]]. It was a religion based on obedience, power, and the cult of the leader, with Hitler himself conceived in [[Messiah|Messianic]] terms.

It owns and operates a [[summer camp]] located in [[Hopewell Junction, New York]] called [[Camp Kinder Ring]]. It also runs an adult vacation campground facility, Circle Lodge, with bungalows and cottages, and a healthcare center in Bronx, New York.

Formed in 1900 by Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants from [[Pale of Settlement|Eastern Europe]], The Workmen's Circle at first acted as a [[benefit society|mutual aid society]], helping its members to adapt to their new life in America. It provided life insurance, unemployment relief, healthcare, social interaction, burial assistance and general education through its branches throughout the US as well as through its national office.  Soon, the organization was joined by more politically focused socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bundists]] who advocated the anti-assimilationist idea of Yiddish cultural autonomy, led by education in Yiddish and socialist ideals. The Circle formed the [[Folksbiene]] Yiddish theatre troupe and promoted Jewish arts and music, Yiddish school programs for children and Yiddish summer camps. It became influential in the American [[Labour movement|labor movement]] and grew to serve more than 84,000 members through hundreds of branches around North America. It also became involved with the Yiddish newspaper ''[[The Forward]]'' and operated old-age homes, medical clinics and other services.

Politically, the Circle moved away from socialism towards [[liberalism]] by the time of the [[New Deal]]. By the 1960s, the Circle's membership began to decline, as Jews joined the middle class and moved from cities to suburbs; the Circle no longer seemed as essential to many as it had been. In the new century, the organization ended its direct health insurance program, streamlined its operations, separated from ''The Forward'', and rededicated its mission to education and promoting Jewish community, secular Yiddish culture and social justice activism. It sold its former East side building and moved to new offices in the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] of New York City in 2011. The Workmen's Circle is a nonprofit [[501(c)(3) organization]].&lt;ref name=Beckerman&gt;Beckerman, Gal.

==History==

===Inception to 1930===
With the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms in the 1880s and succeeding decades]], more than 2 million [[Yiddish]]-speaking Jews fled Eastern Europe with their families, and most immigrated to the United States, many to New York City. They usually arrived penniless, and the bulk of them entered the fast-growing, but exploitative garment industry. Others found work as peddlers, jewelers, launderers, Hebrew tutors and even shopkeepers. To assist each other in adapting to their challenging new life in America, they formed several [[benefit society|mutual aid societies]]. The Workmen's Circle was founded in New York City on September 4, 1900 as a national organization that grew out of the Workingmen's Circle Society of New York, formed in 1892 by Jewish cloak makers.&lt;ref&gt;"Coming Full Circle", 2014 Workmen's Circle Annual Report, The Workmen's Circle, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; It immediately provided to its members life insurance, some unemployment relief, healthcare, social interaction such as dances, and financial assistance in obtaining a graveyard plot. It also held general education sessions on the natural sciences and had the generally pro-labor and [[socialist]] goal "of helping to develop in working people a sense of solidarity, a clear, enlightened outlook, the striving, by means of their unity, to acquire that influence in ultimately, bringing on the day of their complete emancipation from exploitation and oppression."&lt;ref name=EarlyYears&gt;Wax, Dustin M. [http://dwax.org/2000/07/28/brother__friend__comrade_the_workmans_circle_and_jewish_culture__1900-1930/ "'Brother, Friend, Comrade': The Workman’s Circle and Jewish Culture, 1900–1930"], dwax.org, July 28, 2000, accessed November 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other mutual aid groups, the organization had a workers' social agenda that it took seriously. It "agitated to abolish child labor, establish social security and shorten the work day."&lt;ref name=NYT85&gt;Margolick, David. [https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/10/nyregion/workmen-s-circle-85-years-of-aid-to-jews.html "Workmen's Circle: 85 Years of Aid to Jews"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 10, 1985, accessed November 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization began to form a national network of autonomous branches soon after its founding, chartered through the national organization, that provided services to their local members.&lt;ref name=Philadelphia&gt;Felsten, Judith [http://www2.hsp.org/collections/Balch%20manuscript_guide/html/workmenscircle.html "Register of the Records of the Workmen's Circle, Philadelphia District, 1931–1968"], October 1982, accessed November 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; From 1905, greatly increased Jewish immigration to the US, following new pogroms in Russia, brought to America large numbers of politically sophisticated socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bundists]]. The Bundists advocated the anti-Zionist, anti-assimilationist idea of Yiddish cultural autonomy and a secular Jewish identity, led by education in Yiddish language and literature, socialist ideals, Jewish history and ethical and aesthetic culture, an idea championed by [[Chaim Zhitlowsky]]. Many of the Bundists joined The Workmen's Circle and pushed it both to fight exploitative labor practices and to expand its national activities toward Yiddish education and to focus on Yiddish culture, rather than simply providing financial aid. Many of the older members argued that the organization could barely afford to provide its traditional aid to members; this discussion continued for two decades. Zhitlowsky and the Bundists succeeded in persuading the organization to establish a range of cultural activities meant to inform and express the secular Jewish spirit, such as the [[Folksbiene]] Yiddish theatre troupe (1915), Yiddish book publishing, orchestras, and art expositions sponsored by the branches around the country, Yiddish after school programs for children and teens (beginning in 1918), adult lecture circuits, [[Camp Kinderland]] (1923) and the organization's own literary and political journal, ''The Friend'', and ''Unser Schul'' (''Our School''), a monthly pedagogical journal for the teachers in its schools.&lt;ref name=EarlyYears/&gt; 

In the meantime, especially after a series of garment workers' strikes in New York beginning in 1910, the Circle became influential in the American [[labor movement]] through the [[United Hebrew Trades]], later helping to found the [[Jewish Labor Committee]].&lt;ref name=EarlyYears/&gt; At the same time, the Workmen's Circle continued its role as a mutual aid society. In 1917 it adopted the [[National Fraternal Congress of America]] mortuary table, and by 1920 it established a sanatorium for [[tuberculosis]] patients at [[Liberty, New York]], where members could receive free treatment for nine months.&lt;ref&gt;''Fraternal Monitor'', Vol.XXX, Issue No. 9, April 1920, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the organization reached its peak of 84,000 members, 125 schools nationwide&lt;ref name=NYT85/&gt; and numerous branches nationwide; for example, the [[Philadelphia]] district had 17 branches in 1924.&lt;ref name=Philadelphia/&gt; But during that decade, members of The Workmen's Circle sympathetic to the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] initiated a power-struggle in the Circle's national organization and many of its branches around the country, but they were rejected in 1929 and formed a separate organization, taking with them about 5,000 members and some of the Circle's establishments, like Camp Kinderland.&lt;ref name=EarlyYears/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berger&gt;Berger, Joseph. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/13/nyregion/13communist.html?_r=0 "Jewish Currents Magazine and a Longtime Adversary Decide to Merge"], April 13, 2006, accessed November 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s to 2000===
In the middle of the 20th century, The Workmen's Circle continued to operate old age homes and medical clinics and offer burial assistance, affordable health and life insurance; it established [[Camp Kinder Ring]] to replace Camp Kinderland (and some branches also operated camps);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campkr.com/kinder-ring-experience/about-us Camp Kinder Ring: About Us], The Workmen's Circle, accessed November 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and it continued to have a hand in operating the Yiddish-language newspaper ''[[The Forward]]'', which shared its office building in New York. The organization continued to emphasize Yiddish education and the arts ([[klezmer music]]; Folksbiene theatre; choral groups), mutual aid and social interaction. It also emphasized social justice, such as efforts to oppose the repression of Soviet Jewry, and support of humanitarian relief efforts, as its political perspective had moved away from socialism towards [[liberalism]] by the time of the [[New Deal]], and its members enthusiastically supported America's entry into World War II and even became pro-Israel.&lt;ref name=NYT85/&gt;&lt;ref name=Philadelphia/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirsch&gt;Hirsch, Deborah. [http://jewishexponent.com/with-appointment-of-new-president,-the-%27circle%27-now-comes-full-circle "With Appointment of New President, the 'Circle' Now Comes Full Circle"], ''Jewish Exponent'', November 11, 2010, accessed November 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the Workmen's Circle included 700 local branches with 70,000 members in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Baskin, Joseph. "The Workmen's Circle", ''In Southern States'', Journal for the 1949 convention of the Southern Region of the Workmen's Circle, Joseph Duntov (ed.), pp. 5 and 38–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning by the 1960s, the Circle's membership slowly declined, reaching a level of about 50,000 members by the 1980s.&lt;ref name=NYT85/&gt; When the federal Medicare program began in 1966, the Circle's healthcare programs became less urgently needed.&lt;ref name=Philadelphia/&gt; More generally, as its then-president Dr. Barnett Zumhoff explained to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1985, with the opening up opportunities for Jews in American society, and their move into the middle class and dispersion geographically from cities to suburbs and small towns, the Circle was no longer as essential to the Jewish community as it had been. Its membership was no longer predominantly workers, but had become small-business owners, professionals and schoolteachers. Still, the Circle believed that it offered a secular alternative to synagogue attendance and Zionist groups in its preservation of [[Ashkenazic]] Yiddish culture.&lt;ref name=NYT85/&gt;

By 1996, the Circle's membership had declined to 28,000. By then, it considered itself the only organization promoting Eastern European Yiddish culture. It continued to teach Yiddish language and literature, to promote secular Jewish community and Jewish arts, music and culture, to provide its aid and insurance programs, to operate its old age homes, schools, camps and to host "holiday observances interpreting Jewish history in the traditionally secular Workmen's Circle spirit."&lt;ref name=Philadelphia/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greene&gt;Greene, Donna. [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/03/nyregion/a-keeper-of-the-flame-of-jewish-culture.html "A Keeper of the Flame of Jewish Culture"], ''The New York Times'', November 3, 1996, accessed November 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  It also continued its liberal agenda, supporting universal health care, for example. Its then-president, Mark Mlotek, noted: "this is an organization that says that the language of the murdered people in Eastern Europe was Yiddish ... there is a vibrant Yiddish culture [that] has to be maintained. Without it, a heart and soul will really go away."&lt;ref name=Greene/&gt;

===21st century===
In the first decade of the 21st century, the organization ended its direct health insurance program and closed its old age homes, streamlined its operations, separated itself from ''The Forward'', hired a new executive director, Ann Toback, in 2008, reorganized its board and appointed a new president, Madelon "Maddy" Braun, in 2010.&lt;ref name=Beckerman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt; It rededicated its mission to education and promoting Jewish community, Yiddish culture and social justice activism.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, George. [http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/short-takes/rock-bye-my-baby-yiddish-melody "Rock-a-bye, My Baby, with a Yiddish Melody"], ''[[The Jewish Week]]'', January 24, 2012, accessed November 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; "The plan is to reboot by offering something [the Circle] feels religious Judaism has failed to provide: an education toward a cultural Jewish identity that uses religion as a trigger for activism and connects with a legacy of progressivism and commitment to universal values."&lt;ref name=Beckerman/&gt; The organization sold its former East side building and moved to new offices in the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] of New York City in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, Masha. [http://forward.com/articles/144383/workmen-s-circle-arbeter-ring-sets-up-shop-in-ne/ "Workmen’s Circle/Arbeter Ring Sets Up Shop in New York City’s Garment District"], ''The Forward'', October 21, 2011, accessed November 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, the Circle had 10,000 members and 20 branches. It used proceeds from the sale of its building to being to regrow its membership and community and school network, and to hire more educators.&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt; Toback said, "Our expression of Judaism is through activism, and we also believe that young people come to activism through being literate Jews. The two things go together."&lt;ref name=Beckerman/&gt; Continuing to teach children Yiddish is "a way of opening their minds and souls to something in our collective past that it is extremely important to connect to."&lt;ref name=Beckerman/&gt; In 2012, the Circle commissioned a study that showed that one in six American Jews "are actively seeking Jewish expression and engagement outside of synagogue life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/culture/article/one_in_6_unaffiliated_u.s._jews_seeking_jewish_expression_poll_finds "One in 6 unaffiliated U.S. Jews seeking Jewish expression, poll finds"], ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]]'', October 10, 2012, accessed November 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Circle continues to operate its summer camp, sponsor holiday and community events, coordinate its branches around the country and partner with Jewish school programs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://circle.org/connect/national-communities "National Communities"]; [https://circle.org/what-we-do/jewish-learning "Jewish Learning"]; [https://circle.org/what-we-do/yiddish-language "Yiddish Language"], The Workmen's Circle, accessed November 10, 2014; Crowley, Chris.

==Publications==
As an organization organically linked to the historic Jewish labor movement, many of the Workmen's Circle's leaders were involved from its inception until the start of the 21st century with ''The Forward''. Through much of the 20th century, the organization's newsletter was called ''The Workmen's Circle Call''.&lt;ref name=NYT85/&gt; From 2005 to 2009, The Workmen's Circle published ''[[Jewish Currents]]'' magazine and supplied it to the members of the Circle.&lt;ref name=Berger/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishcurrents.org/circle.htm "Welcoming Our New Workmen's Circle Readers"], ''[[Jewish Currents]]'', accessed November 9, 2014; and [http://jewishcurrents.blogspot.com/ "The Future of Jewish Currents"], ''Jewish Currents'' editor's blog, March 16, 2009, accessed November 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth programs==
The youth section of the Workmen's Circle in its early years was the Young Circle League of America (YCLA), established in 1930.&lt;ref name=Goldman&gt;Y. Murray Goldman, "YCLA – Fraternal Order for Progressive Youth," ''The New Leader'' [New York], vol. 20, no. 18 (May 1, 1937), pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The group self-identified as "first and foremost a ''cultural'' organization," sponsoring lectures, debates, and educational and recreational programs for its members.&lt;ref name=Goldman /&gt; The YCLA also published its own magazine, ''The Call of Youth.''&lt;ref name=Goldman /&gt;

The Arbeter Ring runs seven kindershuls, or children's schools of [[Jewish culture]], as after-school and Sunday school programs for elementary through middle schoolers.&lt;ref&gt;Zumoff, Barnett. [http://jewishcurrents.org/the-secular-yiddish-school-and-summer-camp-a-hundred-year-history-19879#more-19879 "The Secular Yiddish School and Summer Camp: A Hundred-Year History"], ''Jewish Currents'', August 9, 2013, accessed November 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These are located in the Northeastern US and Chicago.&lt;ref name=Newsletter2016/&gt; Kindershuls emphasize the teaching of Jewish history, from Abraham onward. Jewish culture, including klezmer music and traditional Jewish cooking, is also emphasized, along with the Yiddish language and surrounding culture. Students learn to sing traditional songs in Yiddish, as well as in English and Hebrew.  At the end of a student's time at kindershul, when he or she reaches age 12, a secular Bar/Bas Mitzvah ceremony, called a commencement, is held.&lt;ref name=JTA/&gt; Commencement students prepare a research paper, a family history paper, and a writeup on [[community service]] they have performed through the year. At the group commencement itself, students give a talk on their research topic of choice, often also telling their family history.
