'''47''' ('''forty-seven''')  is the [[natural number]] following [[46 (number)|46]] and preceding [[48 (number)|48]].

==In mathematics==
Forty-seven is the fifteenth prime number, a [[safe prime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005385|title=Sloane's A005385 : Safe primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the thirteenth [[supersingular prime (moonshine theory)|supersingular prime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002267|title=Sloane's A002267 : The 15 supersingular primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sixth [[Lucas prime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005479|title=Sloane's A005479 : Prime Lucas numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-seven is a [[highly cototient number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A100827|title=Sloane's A100827 : Highly cototient numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[Eisenstein prime]] with no imaginary part and real part of the form {{nowrap|3''n'' − 1}}.

It is a [[Lucas number]]. It is also a [[Keith number]] because its digits appear as successive terms earlier in the series of Lucas numbers: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47… ;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A007629|title=Sloane's A007629 : Repfigit (REPetitive FIbonacci-like diGIT) numbers (or Keith numbers)|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty-seven is a [[strictly non-palindromic number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A016038|title=Sloane's A016038 : Strictly non-palindromic numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its representation in binary being  00101111, 47 is a prime [[Thabit number]], and as such is related to the pair of [[amicable number]]s {17296, 18416}.

Forty-seven is a [[Carol number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A093112|title=Sloane's A093112 : a(n) = (2^n-1)^2 - 2|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In science==
* 47 is the [[atomic number]] of [[silver]].

===Astronomy===
* The 47-year cycle of [[Mars]]: after 47 years - 22 [[synodic]] periods of 780 days each - Mars returns to the same position among the stars and is in the same relationship to the Earth and Sun. The [[ancient Mesopotamians]] discovered this cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spaces.imperial.edu/russell.lavery/Ast100/Lectures/Ast100Topic05.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Messier object]] [[Open Cluster M47|M47]], a [[visual magnitude|magnitude]] 4.5 [[open cluster]] in the [[constellation]] [[Puppis]]
* The [[New General Catalogue]] object [[NGC 47]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20080509135303/http://www.ngcic.org/ The NGC / IC Project - Home of the Historically Corrected New General Catalogue (HCNGC) since 1993&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[barred spiral galaxy]] in the constellation [[Cetus]]. This object is also designated as [[NGC 58]].

==In popular culture==

===Pomona College===
{{anchor|As an in-joke}}
Forty-seven has been the favorite number of [[Pomona College]], [[California]], [[United States]], since 1964. A [[mathematical proof]], written in 1964 by Professor [[Donald Bentley]], supposedly demonstrates that all numbers are equal to 47.&lt;ref name="Pomona47trek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pomona.edu/welcome/trek/47trek.shtml |publisher=Pomona College (via [[Internet Archive]])|title=The Mystique of 47|accessdate=2010-05-16|ref=Pomona47trek |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901185414/http://www.pomona.edu/welcome/trek/47trek.shtml |archivedate = 2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bentley offered it as a "joke proof" to further a popular student research project that listed real and imaginative "47 sightings". Bentley used the invalid proof to introduce his students to the concept of mathematical proofs.&lt;ref name="Pomona47trek" /&gt; The proof used limits to show that the sum of the two equal sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the base side. Bentley chose forty-seven as the base side, but he could have used any number.

===''Star Trek''===
[[Joe Menosky]] graduated from Pomona College in 1979 and went on to become one of the story writers of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Menosky "infected" other Star Trek writers with an enthusiasm for the number 47.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.pomona.edu/welcome/trek/kyl.shtml |publisher=Pomona College (via [[Internet Archive]]) |title=Stardate 47 |accessdate=2010-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901185422/http://www.pomona.edu/welcome/trek/kyl.shtml |archivedate=September 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, 47, its reverse 74, its multiples, or combinations of 47 occur in a large number of episodes of the program and its spin-offs ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'',&lt;ref name=Pomona47trek /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.pomona.edu/welcome/trek/trek.shtml |publisher=Pomona College (via [[Internet Archive]]) |title=Starbase Pomona |accessdate=2010-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901092141/http://www.pomona.edu/welcome/trek/trek.shtml |archivedate=September 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually in the form of dialogue, on-screen labels, or computer screens. For example:

&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT add any more 47 references from Star Trek. Six examples are plenty. --&gt;
* In the ''TNG'' episode "[[Darmok]]", the computer of the Enterprise reports to have found 47 occurrences of the word "Darmok" in its database.
* In ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'', Scotty manages to beam up only 47 El-Aurians before their ship is destroyed by the energy ribbon.
* In the ''Voyager'' episode "[[Parallax (Star Trek: Voyager)|Parallax]]", we learn that the Emergency Medical Holographic Channel is 47 and that the [[Doctor (Star Trek: Voyager)|EMH]] has the experience of 47 individual medical officers.
* In the ''Voyager'' episode "[[Non Sequitur (Star Trek: Voyager)|Non Sequitur]]", [[Harry Kim (Star Trek)|Harry Kim]] lives in apartment 4-G, G being the seventh letter of the alphabet. The intentionality of this reference to 47 was confirmed by Brannon Braga, the writer of that episode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlock.net/letternew.html schlock.net: A letter from Brannon Braga&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 2009 film ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' was built in Sector 47 of the Riverside Shipyards, and 47 Klingon ships are said to have been destroyed by [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]]'s ship, the ''Narada''.
&lt;!-- End of references to 47 in Star Trek --&gt;

[[J. J. Abrams]], who produced and directed ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', frequently uses the number 47 in his productions, including episodes of his TV series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]].'' In the Season 1 episode "[[Bad Dreams (Fringe)|Bad Dreams]]", aired shortly before the release of ''Star Trek'' in theaters, Nick Lane's bulletin board features a large centrally-located sheet of paper with only the number 47 in huge typeface. It recurs in the series: for example, 47 minutes being the maximum amount of time for a time chamber in the series to last, and there being exactly 47 shapeshifters. J.J. Abrams continues to incorporate 47 into movies and series he produces and directs. 
The final sequence of Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol takes place on Pier 47.
There are many 47s in ''Fringe'', ''Alias'', and ''Revolution''. In ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', the thermal oscillator is located in Precinct 47. In the Season 1 episode "Soul Train" of the series ''[[Revolution (TV series)|Revolution]]'', the characters are involved with an old train engine where the engine number happens to be 47.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roco|title=Revolution Observations: 1.05 Soul Train|url=http://seriable.com/revolution-observations-1-05-soul-train/|publisher=Seriable.com|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 U.S. presidential election===
During the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election]], Republican candidate [[Mitt Romney]] made a comment claiming that [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012#47% comment|47 percent]] of Americans do not pay any income tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dixon|first1=Kim|title=Analysis: "47 percent" lament belies Republican tax credit support|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taxes-47percent-idUSBRE89I08T20121019|accessdate=September 11, 2016|work=Reuters|date=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cillizza|first1=Chris|title=Why Mitt Romney’s "47 percent" comment was so bad|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/03/04/why-mitt-romneys-47-percent-comment-was-so-bad/|accessdate=September 11, 2016|work=Washington Post|date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the comment potentially sabotaged his chances of winning the election against [[Barack Obama]], the term "47 percent" has been used by critics to describe actions that could potentially damage a political candidate. For example, during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]], [[Hillary Clinton]]'s speech labeling half [[Donald Trump]]'s supporters as "[[Basket of deplorables|deplorable]]" was compared by critics to Romney's 47 percent speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chozick|first1=Amy|title=Hillary Clinton Calls Many Trump Backers ‘Deplorables,’ and G.O.P.

===Pro Era===
[[File:47 (Pro Era).svg|thumb|right|180px|The "47" symbol associated with Pro Era]]
The [[Brooklyn]]-based hip hop collective [[Pro Era]] and its late co-founder [[Capital Steez|Jamal Dewar]], better known by his stage name Capital Steez, have made references to the number 47 in various songs by members of the group. The design of one of Pro Era's logos is the number 47 with its digits joined together.&lt;ref name="47 symbol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/controversial-symbol-shows-up-along-avenue-k-in-midwood-1.7483273 |title=Controversial symbol shows up along Avenue K in Midwood |work=[[News 12 Brooklyn]] |publisher=News 12 Brooklyn |date=24 March 2014 |accessdate=21 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706121008/http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/controversial-symbol-shows-up-along-avenue-k-in-midwood-1.7483273 |archive-date=2014-07-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the group's connection with the number can be linked to the production of Capital Steez's 2012 debut mixtape ''AmeriKKKan Korruption.'' The rapper was heavily fixated with the number during that time; he felt that 47 was a perfect expression of balance in the world, representing the tension between the heart and the brain (the '''fourth''' and '''seventh''' [[chakra]], respectively.)&lt;ref name="The Fader"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2013/11/26/capital-steez-king-capital |title=Capital Steez: King Capital |date=November 26, 2013 |first=Eli |last=Rosenberg |work=[[The Fader]] |accessdate=August 30, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830232255/http://www.thefader.com/2013/11/26/capital-steez-king-capital |archivedate=August 30, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13666">An '''automated efficiency model (AEM)''' is a [[mathematical model]] that estimates a real estate property’s efficiency by using details specific to the property which are available publicly and/or housing characteristics which are aggregated over a given area such as a zip code. AEMs have some similarities to an [[automated valuation model]] (AVM) in terms of concept, advantages and disadvantages.

AEMs calculate specific efficiencies such as location, water, energy or solar efficiency. The Council of Multiple Listing Services defines an AEM as, “any algorithm or scoring model that estimates the [efficiency] of a home without an on-site inspection. They are similar to Automated Valuation Models (AVMs), but are more reliant on public data such as square footage...and estimated energy usage.&lt;ref name="CMLS Green Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=CMLS Green Sheet: Automated Efficiency Models|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/councilofmls.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/Files/CMLSGreenMLSSConAEMS1.pdf|website=Council of Multiple Listing Services|publisher=Council of Multiple Listing Services|accessdate=1 March 2017|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

Most AEMs calculate a property’s selected efficiency by analyzing available public information and may also apply proprietary data or formulas, and allow for a user such as a home owner to make additional inputs.  Housing characteristics such as age of the home or square footage may be obtained by data providers such as those on this [[list of online real estate databases]] or a similar offerings. Estimates of energy usage may be available from published sources such as through the Residential Energy Consumption Survey by the [[Energy Information Administration]].

== Examples of use ==
By design, the AEM score output is provided as a preliminary comparison tool so the score of one property may be compared to other homes, against an average score for the area, etc. Primary users may vary from buyers and sellers to real estate agents and appraisers as they complete relevant comparisons.  For example, REColorado, the multiple listing service covering the Denver metro area, presents a UtilityScore widget on homes for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McPherson|first1=Marian|title=UtilityScore comes to REcolorado.com|url=http://www.inman.com/2016/09/19/utilityscore-comes-to-recolorado/|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=Inman News|date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zillow publishes a Sun Number score on the home fact sheet so website visitors can compare the solar energy potential of prospective properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sun Number Partnership with Zillow Brings Solar Potential Scores to Millions of Americans|url=https://energy.gov/eere/success-stories/articles/eere-success-story-sun-number-partnership-zillow-brings-solar|website=EERE Success Story|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=28 February 2017|date=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trulia has published a report using automated estimates from UtilityScore to present water, natural gas and electric rates into a single price per square foot by zip code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grant|first1=Kelli|title=Before you buy that home, avoid utility bill shock|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/26/before-you-buy-that-home-avoid-utility-bill-shock.html|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=CNBC|date=26 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond usage for consumer preliminary comparisons, usage of AEMs varies by industry.  AEMs may also be used by solar installers, home improvement contractors, efficiency inspectors, and mortgage lenders.

In the [[photovoltaics]] industry, installers use Sun Number to reduce the soft costs associated with motivating consumers to invest in solar systems and in recording property specifications to create quotes. The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] has found that Sun Number eliminates 7–10 days from the quotation process when solar suitability is determined digitally and eliminates the need for an onsite inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herman|first1=David|title=New Blueprint for Rooftop Solar Analysis|url=http://solarbuildermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SB_SEPT_OCT_2013.pdf|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=Solar Builder Magazine|date=September–October 2013|pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AEMs have been used in the mortgage industry to support a niche loan product called a [[Location Efficient Mortgage]] (LEM). During underwriting, an AEM such as the H+T Affordability Index is used to calculate the location efficient value&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birdsell|first1=T.|last2=Dewar|first2=J.|last3=Sommers|first3=K.|last4=Zeidman|first4=M.|title=An Overview of Two Land Use Planning Tools Location Efficient Mortgages and Inclusionary Zoning|url=http://courses.washington.edu/udp501/501%20papers/Assign4_LEM+IZ.doc|website=Washington University|publisher=Washington University|accessdate=28 February 2017|archiveurl=http://dtpr.lib.athabascau.ca/action/download.php?filename=mais/700/suzannezemanProject.pdf|pages=2|format=Thesis|date=2012|archive-date=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to National Mortgage Professional Magazine AEMs may one day be incorporated into loan underwriting as well, “Since utilities are as big or bigger part of home expenses than even real estate taxes, we may see [estimated utility usage] begin to be factored into underwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Councilman|first1=J.|title=News from NAMP: October 20, 2016.

== Methodology ==
AEMs generate a score for a specific property based on both publicly available housing characteristics about the subject property as well as mathematical modeling. AEMs are technology-driven scores without an onsite inspection or human assessment. For more accurate information unique to a specific property an onsite inspection such as an [[energy audit]] is required.

Detailed information on the data accessed to calculate an AEM, the modeling formulas and algorithms are generally not published.  A summary of general information is listed in the table below:

== Advantages ==
As shown in the section above, AEMs tend to rely on public information rather than information which is private to the resident such as actual utility bills. Utility bills can vary based on the occupancy and [[personal property]] within a structure.  The public information used in AEMs is relatively static as it is focused on details of the structure, location and/or mechanical systems and therefore tends to reflect the [[real property]] transferred during a real estate transaction.

According to the Council of Multiple Listing Services advantages are, “AEMs provide consumers with a quick comparison of all properties across a specified market. Since most focus on the attached systems and structure, they are only meant to reflect the efficiency of the real property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMLS Green Sheet: Automated Efficiency Models|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/councilofmls.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/Files/CMLSGreenMLSSConAEMS1.pdf|website=Council of Multiple Listing Services|publisher=Council of Multiple Listing Services|accessdate=1 March 2017|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

== Disadvantages ==
According to the Council of Multiple Listing Services advantages are, “AEMs are dependent on data used, the assumptions made, and the model methodology. Since models and methodologies differ and no on-site inspections are performed, accuracy may vary among scoring systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMLS Green Sheet: Automated Efficiency Models|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/councilofmls.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/Files/CMLSGreenMLSSConAEMS1.pdf|website=Council of Multiple Listing Services|publisher=Council of Multiple Listing Services|accessdate=1 March 2017|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

{{Quantum mechanics}}
The '''Bell states''', a concept in [[quantum information science]], are specific [[quantum states]] of two [[qubits]] that represent the simplest (and maximal) examples of [[quantum entanglement]]. They are named after [[John S. Bell]] because they are the subject of his famous [[Bell's theorem|Bell inequality]].  An '''[[EPR paradox|EPR pair]]''' is a pair of [[qubits]]  (or quantum bits) that are in a Bell state together. Because of the entanglement, measurement of one qubit will assign one of two possible values to the other qubit instantly, where the value assigned depends on which Bell state the two qubits are in. This behaviour is not subject to relativistic limitations such as the [[speed of light]], but the [[no-communication theorem]] prevents this behaviour to be used to transmit [[information]] faster than light. The phenomena can be used to agree upon random numbers in less time than it would take to communicate the numbers at the speed of light over the distance between the peers – this was believed to be a result of an error in quantum physics and was named the [[EPR paradox]]. Originally, the paradox was resolved by giving up  the assumption that the [[principle of locality]] is true, but other [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] have also emerged.

==The Bell states==
The Bell states are four specific maximally entangled [[quantum states]] of two [[qubit]]s.

The degree to which a state in a quantum system consisting of two "particles" is entangled is measured by the [[Von Neumann entropy]] of either of the two reduced [[density operator]]s of the state. The Von Neumann entropy of a pure state is zero—also for the Bell states, which are specific pure states. But the 2x2 density matrix &lt;math&gt;\hat\rho&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the Bell states can be formed as usual, and the von Neumann entropy of this density operator of the Bell states is  positive and maximal, if the matrix does not degenerate to a projector.&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Entanglement in Electron Optics: Generation, Characterization, and Applications, Naresh Chandra, Rama Ghosh, Springer, 2013, {{ISBN|3642240704}}, p. 43, [https://books.google.com/books?id=be6BCYFzqFQC&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=maximally%20entangled%20von%20neumann%20entropy&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=maximally%20entangled%20von%20neumann%20entropy&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The qubits are usually thought to be spatially separated.  However far apart they are, they exhibit perfect [[correlation]] even though there is no way to tell which state each qubit is in — a situation that cannot be explained without [[quantum mechanics]].

In order to explain this, consider first the Bell state &lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B + |1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B).&lt;/math&gt;

This [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] means the following: The qubit held by Alice (subscript "A") can be 0 as well as 1. If Alice measured her qubit in the standard basis, the outcome would be perfectly random, either possibility 0 or 1 having probability 1/2. But if Bob (subscript "B") then measured his qubit, the outcome would be the same as the one Alice got. So, if Bob measured, he would also get a random outcome on first sight, but if Alice and Bob communicated, they would find out that, although their outcomes seemed random, they are perfectly correlated.

The perfect correlation at a distance is special: maybe the two particles "agreed" in advance, when the pair was created (before the qubits were separated), which outcome they would show in case of a measurement.

Hence, following [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky|Podolsky]], and [[Nathan Rosen|Rosen]] in 1935 in their famous "[[EPR paradox|EPR]] paper", there is something missing in the description of the qubit pair given above&amp;mdash;namely this "agreement", called more formally a [[hidden variable theory|hidden variable]].

But quantum mechanics allows qubits to be in [[quantum superposition]]&amp;mdash;i.e. in 0 and 1 simultaneously—that is, a linear combination of the two states — for example, the states &lt;math&gt;|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;. If Alice and Bob chose to measure in this [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], i.e. check whether their qubit were &lt;math&gt;|+\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|-\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, they would find the same correlations as above. That is because the Bell state can be formally rewritten as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+\rangle_A \otimes |+\rangle_B + |-\rangle_A \otimes |-\rangle_B).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is still the ''same'' state.

In his famous paper of 1964, [[John S. Bell]] showed by simple [[probability theory]] arguments that these correlations (the one for the 0,1 basis and the one for the +,- basis) cannot ''both'' be made perfect by the use of any "pre-agreement" stored in some hidden variables&amp;mdash;but that quantum mechanics predicts perfect correlations. In a more formal and refined formulation known as the [[CHSH Bell test|Bell-CHSH inequality]], it is shown that a certain correlation measure cannot exceed the value 2 if one assumes that physics respects the constraints of [[local hidden variable theory|local "hidden variable" theory]] (a sort of common-sense formulation of how information is conveyed), but certain systems permitted in quantum mechanics can attain values as high as &lt;math&gt;2\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Four specific two-qubit states with the maximal value of &lt;math&gt;2\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; are designated as "Bell states". They are known as the four ''maximally entangled two-qubit Bell states'', and they form a maximally entangled basis, known as the Bell basis, of the four-dimensional Hilbert space for two qubits: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information|last=Nielsen|first=Michael|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9781139495486|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B + |1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B - |1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B + |1\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B - |1\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B).&lt;/math&gt;

==Bell state measurement==
The '''Bell measurement''' is an important concept in [[quantum information science]]: It is a joint quantum-mechanical measurement of two [[qubit]]s that determines which of the four Bell states the two qubits are in.

If the qubits were not in a Bell state before, they get projected into a Bell state (according to the projection rule of [[quantum measurement]]s), and as Bell states are [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]], a Bell measurement is an entangling operation.

Bell state measurement is the crucial step in [[quantum teleportation]]. The result of a Bell state measurement is used by one's co-conspirator to reconstruct the original state of a teleported particle from half of an entangled pair (the "quantum channel") that was previously shared between the two ends.

Experiments that utilize so-called "linear evolution, local measurement" techniques cannot realize a complete Bell state measurement. Linear evolution means that the detection apparatus acts on each particle independently from the state or evolution of the other, and local measurement means that each particle is localized at a particular detector registering a "click" to indicate that a particle has been detected. Such devices can be constructed, for example, from mirrors, beam splitters, and wave plates, and are attractive from an experimental perspective because they are easy to use and have a high measurement [[cross section (physics)|cross-section]].

For entanglement in a single qubit variable, only three distinct classes out of four Bell states are distinguishable using such linear optical techniques. This means two Bell states cannot be distinguished from each other, limiting the efficiency of quantum communication protocols such as [[quantum teleportation|teleportation]]. If a Bell state is measured from this ambiguous class, the teleportation event fails.

Entangling particles in multiple qubit variables, such as (for photonic systems) [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] and a two-element subset of [[azimuthal quantum number|orbital angular momentum]] states, allows the experimenter to trace over one variable and achieve a complete Bell state measurement in the other.&lt;ref&gt;Kwiat, Weinfurter. [https://archive.is/20120712230327/http://pra.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v58/i4/pR2623_1 "Embedded Bell State Analysis"]&lt;/ref&gt; Leveraging so-called hyper-entangled systems thus has an advantage for teleportation. It also has advantages for other protocols such as [[superdense coding]], in which hyper-entanglement increases the channel capacity.

In general, for hyper-entanglement in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables, one can distinguish between at most &lt;math&gt;2^{n+1} - 1&lt;/math&gt; classes out of &lt;math&gt;4^n&lt;/math&gt; Bell states using linear optical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Pisenti, Gaebler, Lynn. [http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ICQI-2011-QMI25 "Distinguishability of Hyper-Entangled Bell States by Linear Evolution and Local Measurement"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bell state correlations==

Independent measurements made on two qubits that are entangled in Bell states positively correlate perfectly, if each qubit is measured in the relevant basis. For the &lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle&lt;/math&gt; state, this means selecting the same basis for both qubits. If an experimenter chose to measure both qubits in a &lt;math&gt;|\Phi^-\rangle&lt;/math&gt; Bell state using the same basis, the qubits would appear positively correlated when measuring in the &lt;math&gt;\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt; basis, anti-correlated in the &lt;math&gt;\{|+\rangle,|-\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt; basis{{Efn|&lt;math&gt;|\Phi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|00\rangle - |11\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} ((|+\rangle_A + |-\rangle_A)(|+\rangle_B + |-\rangle_B) - (|+\rangle_A - |-\rangle_A)(|+\rangle_B - |-\rangle_B))&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} (|++\rangle + |+-\rangle + |-+\rangle + |--\rangle - |++\rangle + |+-\rangle + |-+\rangle - |--\rangle)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+-\rangle + |-+\rangle)
&lt;/math&gt;
}} and partially (probabilistically) correlated in other bases.

The &lt;math&gt;|\Psi^+\rangle&lt;/math&gt; correlations can be understood by measuring both qubits in the same basis and observing perfectly anti-correlated results. More generally, &lt;math&gt;|\Psi^+\rangle&lt;/math&gt; can be understood by measuring the first qubit in basis &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt;, the second qubit in basis &lt;math&gt;b_2 = X.b_1&lt;/math&gt; and observing perfectly positively correlated results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4059">In [[functional analysis]] and related areas of [[mathematics]] '''Brauner space''' is a [[Uniform space|complete]] [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] [[locally convex space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; having a sequence of compact sets &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; such that every other compact set &lt;math&gt;T\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is contained in some &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Brauner spaces are named after [https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=32432 Kalman George Brauner], who began their study{{sfn|Brauner|1973}}. All Brauner spaces are [[stereotype space|stereotype]] and are in the stereotype duality relations with [[Fréchet space]]s:{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2009|p=466}}
:* for any Fréchet space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; its stereotype dual space&lt;ref&gt;The ''stereotype dual'' space to a locally convex space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the space &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; of all linear continuous functionals &lt;math&gt;f:X\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on [[totally bounded set]]s in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; is a Brauner space,
:* and vice versa, for any Brauner space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; its stereotype dual space &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; is a Fréchet space.

== Examples ==

* Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-compact locally compact topological space, and &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}(M)&lt;/math&gt; the space of all functions on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (with values in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt;), endowed with the usual topology of uniform convergence on compact sets in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. The dual space &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(M)&lt;/math&gt; of measures with compact support in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}(M)&lt;/math&gt; is a Brauner space.
* Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth manifold, and &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal E}(M)&lt;/math&gt; the space of smooth functions on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (with values in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt;), endowed with the usual topology of uniform convergence with each derivative on compact sets in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. The dual space &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal E}^\star(M)&lt;/math&gt; of distributions with compact support in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal E}(M)&lt;/math&gt; is a Brauner space.
* Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a Stein manifold and &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}(M)&lt;/math&gt; the space of holomorphic functions on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with the usual topology of uniform convergence on compact sets in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. The dual space &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}^\star(M)&lt;/math&gt; of analytic functionals on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}(M)&lt;/math&gt; is a Brauner space.
* Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a compactly generated Stein group. The space &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}_{\exp}(G)&lt;/math&gt; of holomorphic functions of exponential type on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a Brauner space with respect to a natural topology.{{sfn|Akbarov|2009|p=525}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2664">In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], the '''commutativity of conjunction''' is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[argument form]] and truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]. It is considered to be a law of [[classical logic]]. It is the principle that the conjuncts of a [[logical conjunction]] may switch places with each other, while preserving the [[truth-value]] of the resulting proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic|author=Elliott Mendelson|year=1997|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-412-80830-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal notation ==

''Commutativity of conjunction'' can be expressed in [[sequent]] notation as:

: &lt;math&gt;(P \land Q) \vdash (Q \land P)&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;(Q \land P) \vdash (P \land Q)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;(Q \land P)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of &lt;math&gt;(P \land Q)&lt;/math&gt;, in the one case, and &lt;math&gt;(P \land Q)&lt;/math&gt; is a syntactic consequence of &lt;math&gt;(Q \land P)&lt;/math&gt; in the other, in some [[formal system|logical system]];

or in [[rule of inference|rule form]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \land Q}{\therefore Q \land P}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{Q \land P}{\therefore P \land Q}&lt;/math&gt;

where the rule is that wherever an instance of "&lt;math&gt;(P \land Q)&lt;/math&gt;" appears on a line of a proof, it can be replaced with "&lt;math&gt;(Q \land P)&lt;/math&gt;" and wherever an instance of "&lt;math&gt;(Q \land P)&lt;/math&gt;" appears on a line of a proof, it can be replaced with "&lt;math&gt;(P \land Q)&lt;/math&gt;";

or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:

:&lt;math&gt;(P \land Q) \to (Q \land P)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;(Q \land P) \to (P \land Q)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are [[proposition]]s expressed in some formal system.

== Generalized principle ==
For any propositions H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... H&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and permutation σ(n) of the numbers 1 through n, it is the case that:
 
:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

is equivalent to

:H&lt;sub&gt;σ(1)&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;σ(2)&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;σ(n)&lt;/sub&gt;.

For example, if H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is
:''It is raining''

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is
:''[[Socrates]] is mortal''

and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is
:''2+2=4''

then

''It is raining and Socrates is mortal and 2+2=4''

is equivalent to

''Socrates is mortal and 2+2=4 and it is raining''

and the other orderings of the predicates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6523">In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[functional analysis]], the '''Cotlar–Stein almost orthogonality lemma''' is named after mathematicians [[Mischa Cotlar]]
and [[Elias Stein]]. It may be used to obtain information on the [[operator norm]] on an operator, acting from one [[Hilbert space]] into another
when the operator can be decomposed into ''almost orthogonal'' pieces.
The original version of this lemma
(for [[self-adjoint]] and mutually commuting operators)
was proved by Mischa Cotlar in 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cotlar|1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed him to conclude that the [[Hilbert transform]]
is a [[continuous linear operator]] in &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;
without using the [[Fourier transform]].
A more general version was proved by Elias Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cotlar–Stein almost orthogonality lemma==
Let &lt;math&gt;E,\,F&lt;/math&gt; be two [[Hilbert spaces]].
Consider a family of operators
&lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; j\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;,
with each &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt;
a [[bounded linear operator]] from &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

Denote

: &lt;math&gt;a_{jk}=\Vert T_j T_k^\ast\Vert,
\qquad b_{jk}=\Vert T_j^\ast T_k\Vert.&lt;/math&gt;

The family of operators
&lt;math&gt;T_j:\;E\to F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j\ge 1,&lt;/math&gt;
is ''almost orthogonal'' if

:&lt;math&gt;A=\sup_{j}\sum_{k}\sqrt{a_{jk}}&lt;\infty,
\qquad B=\sup_{j}\sum_{k}\sqrt{b_{jk}}&lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The Cotlar–Stein lemma states that if &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt;
are almost orthogonal,
then the series
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j}T_j&lt;/math&gt;
converges in the [[strong operator topology]],
and that

:&lt;math&gt;\Vert \sum_{j}T_j\Vert \le\sqrt{AB}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
If ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a finite collection of bounded operators, then&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hörmander|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\sum_{i,j} |(R_i v,R_jv)| \le \left(\max_i \sum_j \|R_i^*R_j\|^{1\over 2}\right)\left(\max_i \sum_j \|R_iR_j^*\|^{1\over 2}\right)\|v\|^2.}&lt;/math&gt;

So under the hypotheses of the lemma,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\sum_{i,j} |(T_i v,T_jv)| \le AB\|v\|^2.}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|\sum_{i=1}^n T_iv\|^2 \le AB \|v\|^2,}&lt;/math&gt;

and that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|\sum_{i=m}^n T_iv\|^2 \le \sum_{i,j\ge m} |(T_iv,T_jv)|.}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the partial sums 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{s_n=\sum_{i=1}^n T_iv}&lt;/math&gt;

form a [[Cauchy sequence]]. 

The sum is therefore absolutely convergent with limit satisfying the stated inequality.

To prove the inequality above set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R=\sum a_{ij}R_i^*R_j}&lt;/math&gt;

with |''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;| ≤ 1 chosen so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(Rv,v)=|(Rv,v)|=\sum |(R_iv,R_jv)|.}&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|R\|^{2m} =\|(R^*R)^m\|\le \sum \|R_{i_1}^* R_{i_2} R_{i_3}^* R_{i_4} \cdots R_{i_{2m}}\| \le \sum \left(\|R_{i_1}^*\|\|R_{i_1}^*R_{i_2}\|\|R_{i_2}R_{i_3}^*\|\cdots \|R_{i_{2m-1}}^* R_{i_{2m}}\|\|R_{i_{2m}}\|\right)^{1\over 2}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|R\|^{2m} \le n \cdot \max \|R_i\| \left(\max_i \sum_j \|R_i^*R_j\|^{1\over 2}\right)^{2m}\left(\max_i \sum_j \|R_iR_j^*\|^{1\over 2}\right)^{2m-1}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking 2''m''th roots and letting ''m'' tend to ∞,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|R\|\le  \left(\max_i \sum_j \|R_i^*R_j\|^{1\over 2}\right)\left(\max_i \sum_j \|R_iR_j^*\|^{1\over 2}\right),}&lt;/math&gt;

which immediately implies the inequality.

==Generalization==
There is a generalization of the Cotlar–Stein lemma with sums replaced by integrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knapp|Stein|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calderon|first1=Alberto|last2=Vaillancourt|first2=Remi|title=On the boundedness of pseudo-differential operators|journal=Journal of the Mathematical Society of Japan|date=1971|volume=23|issue=2|pages=374–378|doi=10.2969/jmsj/02320374}}&lt;/ref&gt;Let ''X'' be a locally compact space and μ a Borel measure on ''X''. Let ''T''(''x'') be a map from ''X'' into bounded operators from ''E'' to ''F'' which is uniformly bounded and continuous in the strong operator topology. If 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{A= \sup_x \int_X \|T(x)^*T(y)\|^{1\over 2} \, d\mu(y),\,\,\, B= \sup_x \int_X \|T(y)T(x)^*\|^{1\over 2}\, d\mu(y),}&lt;/math&gt;

are finite, then the function ''T''(''x'')''v'' is integrable for each ''v'' in ''E'' with

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|\int_X T(x)v\, d\mu(x)\| \le \sqrt{AB}  \cdot \|v\|.}&lt;/math&gt;

The result can be proved by replacing sums by integrals in the previous proof or by using Riemann sums to approximate the integrals.

==Example==
Here is an example of an ''orthogonal'' family of operators.  Consider the inifite-dimensional matrices

:&lt;math&gt;
T=\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\vdots\\0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;\vdots\\0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;\vdots\\\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\ddots\end{array}
\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

and also

:&lt;math&gt;
\qquad
T_1=\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\vdots\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\vdots\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\vdots\\\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\ddots\end{array}
\right],
\qquad
T_2=\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\vdots\\0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;\vdots\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\vdots\\\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\ddots\end{array}
\right],
\qquad
T_3=\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\vdots\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\vdots\\0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;\vdots\\\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\ddots\end{array}
\right],
\qquad
\dots.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then
&lt;math&gt;\Vert T_j\Vert=1&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;,
hence the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j\in\mathbb{N}}T_j&lt;/math&gt;
does not converge in the [[uniform operator topology]].

Yet, since
&lt;math&gt;\Vert T_j T_k^\ast\Vert=0&lt;/math&gt;
and 
&lt;math&gt;\Vert T_j^\ast T_k\Vert=0&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;j\ne k&lt;/math&gt;,
the Cotlar–Stein almost orthogonality lemma tells us that 

:&lt;math&gt;T=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{N}}T_j&lt;/math&gt;

converges in the [[strong operator topology]] and is bounded by 1.

In [[mathematics]], '''divided differences''' is an [[algorithm]], historically used for computing tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}  [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[difference engine]], an early [[mechanical calculator]], was designed to use this algorithm in its operation.&lt;ref name="Isaacson2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isaacson|first1=Walter|title=The Innovators|date=2014|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4767-0869-0|page=20|ref=Isaacson2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divided differences is a [[recursion|recursive]] [[division (mathematics)|division]] process.  The method can be used to calculate the coefficients in the [[polynomial interpolation|interpolation polynomial]] in the [[Newton form]].

==Definition==
Given ''k+1'' data points

:&lt;math&gt;(x_0, y_0),\ldots,(x_{k}, y_{k})&lt;/math&gt;

The '''forward divided differences''' are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;[y_\nu] := y_\nu, \qquad \nu \in \{ 0,\ldots,k\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[y_\nu,\ldots,y_{\nu+j}] := \frac{[y_{\nu+1},\ldots , y_{\nu+j}] - [y_{\nu},\ldots , y_{\nu+j-1}]}{x_{\nu+j}-x_\nu}, \qquad \nu\in\{0,\ldots,k-j\},\ j\in\{1,\ldots,k\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''backward divided differences''' are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;[y_\nu] := y_{\nu},\qquad \nu \in \{ 0,\ldots,k\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[y_\nu,\ldots,y_{\nu-j}] := \frac{[y_\nu,\ldots , y_{\nu-j+1}] - [y_{\nu-1},\ldots , y_{\nu-j}]}{x_\nu - x_{\nu-j}}, \qquad \nu\in\{j,\ldots,k\},\ j\in\{1,\ldots,k\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Notation==
If the data points are given as a function ''&amp;fnof;'',

:&lt;math&gt;(x_0, f(x_0)),\ldots,(x_{k}, f(x_{k}))&lt;/math&gt;

one sometimes writes

:&lt;math&gt;f[x_\nu] := f(x_{\nu}), \qquad \nu \in \{ 0,\ldots,k \}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f[x_\nu,\ldots,x_{\nu+j}] := \frac{f[x_{\nu+1},\ldots , x_{\nu+j}] - f[x_\nu,\ldots , x_{\nu+j-1}]}{x_{\nu+j}-x_\nu}, \qquad \nu\in\{0,\ldots,k-j\},\ j\in\{1,\ldots,k\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Several notations for the divided difference of the function ''&amp;fnof;'' on the nodes ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are used:

: &lt;math&gt;[x_0,\ldots,x_n]f,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[x_0,\ldots,x_n;f],&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;D[x_0,\ldots,x_n]f&lt;/math&gt;

etc.

==Example==

Divided differences for  &lt;math&gt;\nu=0&lt;/math&gt; and the first few values of &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \mathopen[y_0] &amp;= y_0 \\
  \mathopen[y_0,y_1] &amp;= \frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0} \\
  \mathopen[y_0,y_1,y_2]
&amp;= \frac{\mathopen[y_1,y_2]-\mathopen[y_0,y_1]}{x_2-x_0}
 =  \frac{\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}-\frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}}{x_2-x_0}
 = \frac{y_2-y_1}{(x_2-x_1)(x_2-x_0)}-\frac{y_1-y_0}{(x_1-x_0)(x_2-x_0)}
\\
  \mathopen[y_0,y_1,y_2,y_3] &amp;= \frac{\mathopen[y_1,y_2,y_3]-\mathopen[y_0,y_1,y_2]}{x_3-x_0}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- the \mathopen command is there because latex otherwise thinks that [...] denotes an optional argument --&gt;

To make the recursive process more clear, the divided differences can be put in a tabular form:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x_0 &amp; y_0 = [y_0] &amp;           &amp;               &amp; \\
        &amp;       &amp; [y_0,y_1] &amp;               &amp; \\
x_1 &amp; y_1 = [y_1] &amp;           &amp; [y_0,y_1,y_2] &amp; \\
        &amp;       &amp; [y_1,y_2] &amp;               &amp; [y_0,y_1,y_2,y_3]\\
x_2 &amp; y_2 = [y_2] &amp;           &amp; [y_1,y_2,y_3] &amp; \\
        &amp;       &amp; [y_2,y_3] &amp;               &amp; \\
x_3 &amp; y_3 = [y_3] &amp;           &amp;               &amp; \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
* [[Linear functional|Linearity]]
:: &lt;math&gt;(f+g)[x_0,\dots,x_n] = f[x_0,\dots,x_n] + g[x_0,\dots,x_n]&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;(\lambda\cdot f)[x_0,\dots,x_n] = \lambda\cdot f[x_0,\dots,x_n]&lt;/math&gt;

* [[Leibniz rule (generalized product rule)|Leibniz rule]]
:: &lt;math&gt;(f\cdot g)[x_0,\dots,x_n] = f[x_0]\cdot g[x_0,\dots,x_n] + f[x_0,x_1]\cdot g[x_1,\dots,x_n] + \dots + f[x_0,\dots,x_n]\cdot g[x_n]&lt;/math&gt;

* Divided differences are symmetric: If &lt;math&gt;\sigma : \{0, \dots, n\} \to \{0, \dots, n\}&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation then 
:: &lt;math&gt;f[x_0, \dots, x_n] = f[x_{\sigma(0)}, \dots, x_{\sigma(n)}]&lt;/math&gt;

*From the [[mean value theorem for divided differences]] it follows that
::&lt;math&gt;f[x_0,\dots,x_n] = \frac{f^{(n)}(\xi)}{n!}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is in the open interval determined by the smallest and largest of the &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt;'s.

===Matrix form===
The divided difference scheme can be put into an upper [[triangular matrix]].
Let &lt;math&gt;T_f(x_0,\dots,x_n)=
\begin{pmatrix}
f[x_0] &amp; f[x_0,x_1] &amp; f[x_0,x_1,x_2] &amp; \ldots &amp; f[x_0,\dots,x_n] \\
0 &amp; f[x_1] &amp; f[x_1,x_2] &amp; \ldots &amp; f[x_1,\dots,x_n] \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; f[x_n]
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then it holds
* &lt;math&gt;T_{f+g} x = T_f x + T_g x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T_{f\cdot g} x = T_f x \cdot T_g x&lt;/math&gt;
:: This follows from the Leibniz rule. It means that multiplication of such matrices is [[commutativity|commutative]]. Summarised, the matrices of divided difference schemes with respect to the same set of nodes form a [[commutative ring]].
* Since &lt;math&gt; T_f x &lt;/math&gt; is a triangular matrix, its [[eigenvalue]]s are obviously &lt;math&gt; f(x_0), \dots, f(x_n) &lt;/math&gt;.
* Let &lt;math&gt;\delta_\xi&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Kronecker delta]]-like function, that is
:: &lt;math&gt;\delta_\xi(t) = \begin{cases}1 &amp;: t=\xi , \\0 &amp;: \mbox{else}.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
: Obviously &lt;math&gt;f\cdot \delta_\xi = f(\xi)\cdot \delta_\xi&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;\delta_\xi&lt;/math&gt; is an [[eigenfunction]] of the pointwise function multiplication. That is &lt;math&gt;T_{\delta_{x_i}} x&lt;/math&gt; is somehow an "[[eigenmatrix]]" of &lt;math&gt;T_f x&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt; T_f x \cdot T_{\delta_{x_i}} x = f(x_i) \cdot T_{\delta_{x_i}} x &lt;/math&gt;. However, all columns of &lt;math&gt;T_{\delta_{x_i}} x&lt;/math&gt; are multiples of each other, the [[matrix rank]] of &lt;math&gt;T_{\delta_{x_i}} x&lt;/math&gt; is 1. So you can compose the matrix of all eigenvectors from the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th column of each &lt;math&gt;T_{\delta_{x_i}} x&lt;/math&gt;. Denote the matrix of eigenvectors with &lt;math&gt;U x&lt;/math&gt;. Example
:: &lt;math&gt; U(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3) = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; \frac{1}{(x_1-x_0)} &amp; \frac{1}{(x_2-x_0)\cdot(x_2-x_1)} &amp; \frac{1}{(x_3-x_0)\cdot(x_3-x_1)\cdot(x_3-x_2)} \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \frac{1}{(x_2-x_1)} &amp; \frac{1}{(x_3-x_1)\cdot(x_3-x_2)} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \frac{1}{(x_3-x_2)} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
:The [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalization]] of &lt;math&gt; T_f x &lt;/math&gt; can be written as
:: &lt;math&gt; U x \cdot \operatorname{diag}(f(x_0),\dots,f(x_n)) = T_f x \cdot U x &lt;/math&gt;.

==Alternative definitions==

===Expanded form===
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f[x_0] &amp;= f(x_0) \\
f[x_0,x_1] &amp;= \frac{f(x_0)}{(x_0-x_1)} + \frac{f(x_1)}{(x_1-x_0)} \\
f[x_0,x_1,x_2] &amp;= \frac{f(x_0)}{(x_0-x_1)\cdot(x_0-x_2)} + \frac{f(x_1)}{(x_1-x_0)\cdot(x_1-x_2)} + \frac{f(x_2)}{(x_2-x_0)\cdot(x_2-x_1)} \\
f[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3] &amp;= \frac{f(x_0)}{(x_0-x_1)\cdot(x_0-x_2)\cdot(x_0-x_3)} + \frac{f(x_1)}{(x_1-x_0)\cdot(x_1-x_2)\cdot(x_1-x_3)} + \frac{f(x_2)}{(x_2-x_0)\cdot(x_2-x_1)\cdot(x_2-x_3)} +\\&amp;\quad\quad \frac{f(x_3)}{(x_3-x_0)\cdot(x_3-x_1)\cdot(x_3-x_2)} \\
f[x_0,\dots,x_n] &amp;=
\sum_{j=0}^{n} \frac{f(x_j)}{\prod_{k\in\{0,\dots,n\}\setminus\{j\}} (x_j-x_k)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

With the help of a [[polynomial function]] &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;q(\xi) = (\xi-x_0) \cdots (\xi-x_n)&lt;/math&gt; this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
f[x_0,\dots,x_n] = \sum_{j=0}^{n} \frac{f(x_j)}{q'(x_j)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we can allow counting backwards from the start of the sequence by defining &lt;math&gt;x_k = x_{k + n + 1} = x_{k - (n + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;  whenever &lt;math&gt;k &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; n &lt; k &lt;/math&gt;. This definition allows &lt;math&gt;x_{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to be interpreted as &lt;math&gt;x_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_{-2}&lt;/math&gt; to be interpreted as &lt;math&gt;x_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_{-n}&lt;/math&gt; to be interpreted as &lt;math&gt;x_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, etc. The expanded form of the divided difference thus becomes

&lt;math&gt;
f[x_0,\dots,x_n] = \sum_{j=0}^{n} \frac{f(x_j)}{\prod\limits_{k=j-n}^{j-1} (x_j - x_k)} + \sum_{j=0}^{n} \frac{f(x_j)}{\prod\limits_{k=j+1}^{j+n} (x_j - x_k)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Yet another characterization utilizes limits:

&lt;math&gt;
f[x_0,\dots,x_n] = \sum_{j=0}^{n} \lim_{x \rightarrow x_j} \left[ \frac{f(x_j)(x - x_j)}{\prod\limits_{k=0}^{n} (x - x_k)} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

====Partial fractions====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Partial fraction]] --&gt;
You can represent [[partial fraction]]s using the expanded form of divided differences. (This does not simplify computation, but is interesting in itself.) If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are [[polynomial function]]s, where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{deg}\ p &lt; \mathrm{deg}\ q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is given in terms of [[linear factor]]s by &lt;math&gt;q(\xi) = (\xi-x_1)\cdot \dots \cdot(\xi-x_n)&lt;/math&gt;, then it follows from partial fraction decomposition that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p(\xi)}{q(\xi)} = \left(t\to\frac{p(t)}{\xi-t}\right)[x_1,\dots,x_n].&lt;/math&gt;
If [[limit of a function|limits]] of the divided differences are accepted, then this connection does also hold, if some of the &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; coincide.

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial function with arbitrary degree
and it is decomposed by &lt;math&gt;f(x) = p(x) + q(x)\cdot d(x)&lt;/math&gt; using [[polynomial division]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;,
then

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{p(\xi)}{q(\xi)} = \left(t\to\frac{f(t)}{\xi-t}\right)[x_1,\dots,x_n].&lt;/math&gt;

===Peano form===
The divided differences can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;f[x_0,\ldots,x_n] = \frac{1}{n!} \int_{x_0}^{x_n} f^{(n)}(t)B_{n-1}(t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[B-spline]] of degree &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; for the data points &lt;math&gt;x_0,\dots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[derivative]] of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

This is called the '''Peano form''' of the divided differences and &lt;math&gt;B_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[Peano kernel]] for the divided differences, both named after [[Giuseppe Peano]].

===Taylor form===

====First order====
If nodes are cumulated, then the numerical computation of the divided differences is inaccurate, because you divide almost two zeros, each of which with a high [[relative error]] due to [[Loss of significance|differences of similar values]]. However we know, that [[difference quotient]]s approximate the [[derivative]] and vice versa:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x} \approx f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \approx y&lt;/math&gt;

This approximation can be turned into an identity whenever [[Taylor's theorem]] applies.
:&lt;math&gt;f(y) = f(x) + f'(x)\cdot(y-x) + f''(x)\cdot\frac{(y-x)^2}{2!} + f'''(x)\cdot\frac{(y-x)^3}{3!} + \dots &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \frac{f(y) - f(x)}{y-x} = f'(x) + f''(x)\cdot\frac{y-x}{2!} + f'''(x)\cdot\frac{(y-x)^2}{3!} + \dots &lt;/math&gt;

You can eliminate the odd powers of &lt;math&gt;y-x&lt;/math&gt; by expanding the [[Taylor series]] at the center between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;x = m-h, y=m+h&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{x+y}{2}, h=\frac{y-x}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(m+h) = f(m) + f'(m)\cdot h + f''(m)\cdot\frac{h^2}{2!} + f'''(m)\cdot\frac{h^3}{3!} + \dots &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(m-h) = f(m) - f'(m)\cdot h + f''(m)\cdot\frac{h^2}{2!} - f'''(m)\cdot\frac{h^3}{3!} + \dots &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(y) - f(x)}{y-x} = \frac{f(m+h) - f(m-h)}{2\cdot h} =
 f'(m) + f'''(m)\cdot\frac{h^2}{3!} + \dots &lt;/math&gt;

====Higher order====
The Taylor series or any other representation with [[function series]] can in principle be used to approximate divided differences. Taylor series are infinite sums of [[monomial|power function]]s. The mapping from a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to a divided difference &lt;math&gt;f[x_0,\dots,x_n]&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear functional]]. We can as well apply this functional to the function summands.

Express power notation with an ordinary function: &lt;math&gt;p_n(x) = x^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Regular Taylor series is a weighted sum of power functions: &lt;math&gt;f = f(0)\cdot p_0 + f'(0)\cdot p_1 + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}\cdot p_2 + \frac{f'''(0)}{3!}\cdot p_3 + \dots &lt;/math&gt;

Taylor series for divided differences: &lt;math&gt;f[x_0,\dots,x_n] = f(0)\cdot p_0[x_0,\dots,x_n] + f'(0)\cdot p_1[x_0,\dots,x_n] + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}\cdot p_2[x_0,\dots,x_n] + \frac{f'''(0)}{3!}\cdot p_3[x_0,\dots,x_n] + \dots &lt;/math&gt;

We know that the first &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; terms vanish, because we have a higher difference order than polynomial order, and in the following term the divided difference is one:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{llcl}
\forall j&lt;n &amp; p_j[x_0,\dots,x_n] &amp;=&amp; 0 \\
 &amp; p_n[x_0,\dots,x_n] &amp;=&amp; 1 \\
 &amp; p_{n+1}[x_0,\dots,x_n] &amp;=&amp; x_0 + \dots + x_n \\
 &amp; p_{n+m}[x_0,\dots,x_n] &amp;=&amp; \sum_{a\in\{0,\dots,n\}^m \text{ with } a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_m} \prod_{j\in a} x_j. \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
It follows that the Taylor series for the divided difference essentially starts with &lt;math&gt;\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}&lt;/math&gt; which is also a simple approximation of the divided difference, according to the [[mean value theorem for divided differences]].

If we would have to compute the divided differences for the power functions in the usual way, we would encounter the same numerical problems that we had when computing the divided difference of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. The nice thing is, that there is a simpler way.
It holds
:&lt;math&gt;
t^n = (1 - x_0\cdot t) \dots \cdot (1 - x_n\cdot t) \cdot
(p_0[x_0,\dots,x_n] + p_1[x_0,\dots,x_n]\cdot t + p_2[x_0,\dots,x_n]\cdot t^2 + \dots) .
&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently, we can compute the divided differences of &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; by a [[power series|division]] of [[formal power series]]. See how this reduces to the successive computation of powers when we compute &lt;math&gt;p_n[h]&lt;/math&gt; for several &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

If you need to compute a whole divided difference scheme with respect to a Taylor series, see the section about divided differences of [[#Polynomials and power series|power series]].

==Polynomials and power series==
Divided differences of polynomials are particularly interesting, because they can benefit from the Leibniz rule.
The matrix &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; with
:&lt;math&gt;
J=
\begin{pmatrix}
x_0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; x_1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; x_2 &amp; 1 &amp;        &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;          &amp; x_n
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

contains the divided difference scheme for the [[identity function]] with respect to the nodes &lt;math&gt;x_0,\dots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;,
thus &lt;math&gt;J^n&lt;/math&gt; contains the divided differences for the [[monomial|power function]] with [[exponent]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
Consequently, you can obtain the divided differences for a [[polynomial function]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt;
with respect to the [[polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;
by applying &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (more precisely: its corresponding matrix polynomial function &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\mathrm{M}}(p)&lt;/math&gt;) to the matrix &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)(\xi) = a_0 + a_1\cdot \xi + \dots + a_n\cdot \xi^n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\mathrm{M}}(p)(J) = a_0 + a_1\cdot J + \dots + a_n\cdot J^n&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \begin{pmatrix}
\varphi(p)[x_0] &amp; \varphi(p)[x_0,x_1] &amp; \varphi(p)[x_0,x_1,x_2] &amp; \ldots &amp; \varphi(p)[x_0,\dots,x_n] \\
0 &amp; \varphi(p)[x_1] &amp; \varphi(p)[x_1,x_2] &amp; \ldots &amp; \varphi(p)[x_1,\dots,x_n] \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \varphi(p)[x_n]
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
This is known as ''Opitz' formula''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl de Boor|de Boor, Carl]], ''Divided Differences'', Surv. Approx. Theory  1  (2005), 46–69, [http://www.emis.ams.org/journals/SAT/papers/2/]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Opitz, G. ''Steigungsmatrizen'', Z. Angew. Math. Mech. (1964), 44, T52–T54&lt;/ref&gt;

Now consider increasing the degree of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to infinity,
i.e. turn the Taylor polynomial to a [[Taylor series]].
Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a function which corresponds to a [[power series]].
You can compute a divided difference scheme by computing the according matrix series applied to &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.
If the nodes &lt;math&gt;x_0,\dots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are all equal,
then &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Jordan block]] and
computation boils down to generalizing a scalar function to a [[matrix function]] using [[Jordan normal form|Jordan decomposition]].

==Forward differences==
{{details|Finite difference}}

When the data points are equidistantly distributed we get the special case called '''forward differences'''. They are easier to calculate than the more general divided differences.

Note that the "divided portion" from '''forward divided difference''' must still be computed, to recover the '''forward divided difference''' from the '''forward difference'''.

===Definition===
Given ''n'' data points
:&lt;math&gt;(x_0, y_0),\ldots,(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\nu} = x_0 + \nu h,\ h &gt; 0,\ \nu=0,\ldots,n-1&lt;/math&gt;

the divided differences can be calculated via '''forward differences''' defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^{(0)} y_i := y_i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^{(k)}y_i := \Delta^{(k-1)}y_{i+1} - \Delta^{(k-1)}y_i,\ k \ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship between divided differences and forward differences is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burden|first1=Richard L.|last2=Faires|first2=J. Douglas|title=Numerical Analysis|date=2011|page=129|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f[x_0, x_1, \ldots , x_k] = \frac{1}{k!h^k}\Delta^{(k)}f(x_0).&lt;/math&gt;

===Example===

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
y_0 &amp;               &amp;                   &amp;                  \\
    &amp; \Delta y_0 &amp;                   &amp;                  \\
y_1 &amp;               &amp; \Delta^2 y_0 &amp;                  \\
    &amp; \Delta y_1 &amp;                   &amp; \Delta^3 y_0\\
y_2 &amp;               &amp; \Delta^2 y_1 &amp;                  \\
    &amp; \Delta y_2 &amp;                   &amp;                  \\
y_3 &amp;               &amp;                   &amp;                  \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

In mathematics, specifically [[algebraic geometry]], '''Donaldson–Thomas theory''' is the theory of '''Donaldson–Thomas invariants'''.   Given a [[compact space|compact]] [[moduli space]] of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] on a [[Calabi–Yau manifold|Calabi–Yau]] threefold, its Donaldson–Thomas invariant is the virtual number of its points, i.e., the integral of the cohomology class 1 against the virtual [[fundamental class]].  The Donaldson–Thomas invariant is a [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] analogue of the [[Casson invariant]].  The invariants were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink= Simon Donaldson|first=Simon|last=Donaldson|author2-link= Richard Thomas (mathematician)|first2=Richard|last2= Thomas|year=1998}}. Donaldson–Thomas invariants have close connections to [[Gromov–Witten invariant]]s of algebraic three-folds and the theory of stable pairs due to [[Rahul Pandharipande]] and Thomas. 

Donaldson–Thomas theory is physically motivated by certain [[Bogomol'nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield state|BPS states]] that occur in [[string theory|string]] and [[gauge theory]].{{what|date=July 2014}}

==Definition and examples==
The basic idea of [[Gromov–Witten invariant]]s is to probe the geometry of a space by studying pseudoholomorphic maps from [[Riemann surface]]s to a smooth target. The moduli stack of all such maps admits a virtual fundamental class, and intersection theory on this stack yields numerical invariants that can often contain enumerative information. In similar spirit, the approach of Donaldson–Thomas theory is to study curves in an algebraic three-fold by their equations. More accurately, by studying ideal sheaves on a space. This moduli space also admits a virtual fundamental class and yields certain numerical invariants that are enumerative.

Whereas in Gromov–Witten theory, maps are allowed to be multiple covers and collapsed components of the domain curve, Donaldson–Thomas theory allows for nilpotent information contained in the sheaves, however, these are integer valued invariants. There are deep conjectures due to [[Davesh Maulik]], [[Andrei Okounkov]], [[Nikita Nekrasov]] and Pandharipande, proved in increasing generality, that Gromov–Witten and Donaldson–Thomas theories of algebraic three-folds are actually equivalent. More concretely, their generating functions are equal after an appropriate change of variables. For Calabi–Yau threefolds, the Donaldson–Thomas invariants can be formulated as weighted Euler characteristic on the moduli space. There have also been recent connections between these invariants, the motivic Hall algebra, and the ring of functions on the quantum torus.{{what|date=August 2015}}

*The moduli space of lines on the [[quintic threefold]] is a discrete set of 2875 points.  The virtual number of points is the actual number of points, and hence the Donaldson–Thomas invariant of this moduli space is the integer 2875.
*Similarly, the Donaldson–Thomas invariant of the moduli space of [[conics]] on the quintic is 609250.

== Facts ==
*The Donaldson–Thomas invariant of the moduli space ''M'' is equal to the weighted [[Euler characteristic]] of ''M''.  The weight function associates to every point in ''M'' an analogue of the [[Milnor number]] of a hyperplane singularity.

== Generalizations ==
* Instead of moduli spaces of sheaves, one considers moduli spaces of [[derived category]] objects. That gives the [[Pandharipande–Thomas invariant]]s that count stable pairs of a Calabi–Yau 3-fold.
* Instead of integer valued invariants, one considers [[motive (algebraic geometry)|motivic]] invariants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4354">In [[mathematics]], the term '''essentially unique''' is used to indicate that while some object is not the only one that satisfies certain properties, all such objects are "the same" in some sense appropriate to the circumstances. This notion of "sameness" is often formalized using an [[equivalence relation]].

A related notion is a [[universal property]], where an object is not only essentially unique, but unique ''up to a unique [[isomorphism]]'' (meaning that it has trivial [[automorphism group]]). In general given two isomorphic examples of an essentially unique object, there is no ''natural'' (unique) isomorphism between them.

==Examples==
===Set theory===
Most basically, there is an essentially unique set of any given [[cardinality]], whether one labels the elements &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt;.
In this case the non-uniqueness of the isomorphism (does one match 1 to ''a'' or to ''c''?) is reflected in the [[symmetric group]].

On the other hand, there is an essentially unique ''ordered'' set of any given finite cardinality: if one writes &lt;math&gt;\{1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{a&lt; b&lt; c\}&lt;/math&gt;, then the only order-preserving isomorphism maps 1 to ''a,'' 2 to ''b,''  and 3 to ''c.''

=== Number theory ===
The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] establishes that the [[factorization]] of any positive [[integer]] into [[Prime number|prime numbers]] is essentially unique, i.e., unique up to the ordering of the prime factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WnkZSSc4IkoC|title=Discrete Mathematics: Proofs, Structures and Applications, Third Edition|last=Garnier|first=Rowan|last2=Taylor|first2=John|date=2009-11-09|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781439812808|location=|pages=452|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group theory===
Suppose that we seek to classify all possible [[group (mathematics)|group]]s. We would find that there is an essentially unique group containing exactly 3 elements, the [[cyclic group]] of order three. No matter how we choose to write those three elements and denote the group operation, all such groups are [[isomorphic]], hence, "the same".

On the other hand, there is not an essentially unique group with exactly 4 elements, as there are two non-isomorphic examples: the cyclic group of order 4 and the [[Klein four group]].

===Measure theory===
Suppose that we seek a [[translation (mathematics)|translation]]-[[invariant measure|invariant]], [[strictly positive measure|strictly positive]], [[locally finite measure]] on the [[real line]]. The solution to this problem is essentially unique: any such measure must be a constant multiple of [[Lebesgue measure]]. Specifying that the measure of the unit interval should be 1 then determines the solution uniquely.

===Topology===
Suppose that we seek to classify all two-dimensional, [[compact space|compact]], [[simply connected]] [[manifold]]s. We would find an essentially unique solution to this problem: the [[2-sphere]]. In this case, the solution is unique up to [[homeomorphism]].

In the area of topology known as [[knot theory]], there is an analogue of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: the decomposition of a knot into a sum of [[Prime knot|prime knots]] is essentially unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSLUBwAAQBAJ|title=An Introduction to Knot Theory|last=Lickorish|first=W. B. Raymond|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461206910|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lie theory===
A [[maximal compact subgroup]] of a [[semisimple Lie group]] may not be unique, but is unique up to conjugation.

=== Coding theory ===
Given the task of using 24-[[bit]] words to store 12 bits of information in such a way that 7-bit errors can be detected and 3-bit errors can be corrected, the solution is essentially unique: the [[Binary Golay code|extended binary Golay code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.ams.org/visualinsight/2015/12/01/golay-code/|title=Golay Code|last=Baez|first=John|date=2015-12-01|work=Visual Insight|access-date=2017-12-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|language=en-US|author-link=John C.

The exact cover problem is a kind of [[constraint satisfaction problem]].

An exact cover problem can be represented by an [[incidence matrix]] or a [[bipartite graph]].

[[Knuth's Algorithm X]] is an [[algorithm]] that finds all solutions to an exact cover problem. DLX is the name given to Algorithm X when it is implemented efficiently using [[Donald Knuth]]'s [[Dancing Links]] technique on a computer.&lt;ref name="knuth" /&gt;

The standard exact cover problem can be generalized slightly to involve not only "exactly one" constraints but also "at-most-one" constraints.
 
Finding [[Pentomino]] tilings and solving [[Sudoku]] are noteworthy examples of exact cover problems.
The [[N queens problem]] is a slightly generalized exact cover problem.

== Formal definition ==

Given a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of [[subset]]s of a set ''X'', an exact cover of ''X'' is a subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies two conditions:
* The [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of any two distinct subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; is [[empty set|empty]], i.e., the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; are [[pairwise disjoint]]. In other words, each element in ''X'' is contained in ''at most one'' subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[union (set theory)|union]] of the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; is ''X'', i.e., the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; [[cover (topology)|cover]] ''X''. In other words, each element in ''X'' is contained in ''at least one'' subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt;.

In short, an exact cover is "exact" in the sense that each element in ''X'' is contained in ''exactly one'' subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Equivalently, an exact cover of ''X'' is a subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; that [[partition of a set|partitions]] ''X''.

For an exact cover of ''X'' to exist, it is necessary that:
* The union of the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is ''X''. In other words, each element in ''X'' is contained in at least one subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the [[empty set]] ∅ is contained in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;, then it makes no difference whether or not it is in any exact cover.
Thus it is typical to assume that:
* The empty set is not in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; contains at least one element.

=== Basic examples ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; = {''N'', ''O'', ''P'', ''E''} be a collection of subsets of a set ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4} such that:
* ''N'' = { },
* ''O'' = {1, 3},
* ''P'' = {2, 3}, and
* ''E'' = {2, 4}.

The subcollection {''O'', ''E''} is an exact cover of ''X'', since the subsets ''O'' = {1, 3} and ''E'' = {2, 4} are disjoint and their union is ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4}.

The subcollection {''N'', ''O'', ''E''} is also an exact cover of ''X''.
Including the empty set ''N'' = { } makes no difference, as it is disjoint with all subsets and does not change the union.

The subcollection {''E'', ''P''} is not an exact cover of ''X''.
The intersection of the subsets ''E'' and ''P'', {2}, is not empty:
The subsets ''E'' and ''P'' are not disjoint.
Moreover, the union of the subsets ''E'' and ''P'', {2, 3, 4}, is not ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4}:
Neither ''E'' nor ''P'' covers the element 1.

On the other hand, there is no exact cover—indeed, not even a cover—of ''Y'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} because &lt;math&gt;\bigcup \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; = {1, 2, 3, 4} is a proper subset of ''Y'':
None of the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; contains the element 5.

=== Detailed example ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; = {''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'', ''F''} be a collection of subsets
of a set ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} such that:
* ''A'' = {1, 4, 7};
* ''B'' = {1, 4};
* ''C'' = {4, 5, 7};
* ''D'' = {3, 5, 6};
* ''E'' = {2, 3, 6, 7}; and
* ''F'' = {2, 7}.

Then the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element in ''X'' is contained in exactly one of the subsets:
* ''B'' = {1, 4};
* ''D'' = {3, 5, 6}; or
* ''F'' = {2, 7}.

Moreover, {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is the only exact cover, as the following argument demonstrates:
Because ''A'' and ''B'' are the only subsets containing 1, an exact cover must contain ''A'' or ''B'', but not both.
If an exact cover contains ''A'', then it doesn't contain ''B'', ''C'', ''E'', or ''F'', as each of these subsets has an element in common with ''A''.
Then ''D'' is the only remaining subset, but the collection {''A'', ''D''} doesn't cover the element 2.
In conclusion, there is no exact cover containing ''A''.
On the other hand, if an exact cover contains ''B'', then it doesn't contain ''A'' or ''C'', as each of these subsets has an element in common with ''B''.
Because ''D'' is the only remaining subset containing 5, ''D'' must be part of the exact cover.
If an exact cover contains ''D'', then it doesn't contain ''E'', as ''E'' has an element in common with ''D''.
Then ''F'' is the only remaining subset, and the collection {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is indeed an exact cover.
See the [[Knuth's Algorithm X#Example|example]] in the article on [[Knuth's Algorithm X]] for a matrix-based version of this argument.

== Representations ==

An exact cover problem is defined by the [[binary relation]] "contains" between subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and elements in ''X''.
There are different equivalent ways to represent this relation.

=== Standard representation ===

The standard way to represent the relation "contains" is to list the elements in each subset.

For example, the [[#Detailed example|detailed example]] above uses this standard representation:
* ''A'' = {1, 4, 7};
* &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''B''&lt;/span&gt; = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;};
* ''C'' = {4, 5, 7};
* &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''D''&lt;/span&gt; = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;};
* ''E'' = {2, 3, 6, 7}; and
* &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt; = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;}.

Again, the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element is contained in exactly one selected subset, as the highlighting makes clear.

=== Inverse representation ===

The relation "contains" between subsets and elements can be [[converse relation|converted]], listing the subsets in which each element is contained. 

For example, the relation "contains" in the [[#Detailed example|detailed example]] above can be represented by listing the subsets each element is contained in:
* 1 is an element of ''A'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''B''&lt;/span&gt;;
* 2 is an element of ''E'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt;;
* 3 is an element of &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''D''&lt;/span&gt;, ''E'';
* 4 is an element of ''A'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''B''&lt;/span&gt;, ''C'';
* 5 is an element of ''C'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''D''&lt;/span&gt;;
* 6 is an element of &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''D''&lt;/span&gt;, ''E''; and
* 7 is an element of ''A'', ''C'', ''E'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt;.

Again, the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element is contained in exactly one selected subset, as the highlighting makes clear.

When solving an exact cover problem, it is often useful to switch between the standard and inverse representations.
is an element of

=== Matrix and hypergraph representations ===

The relation "contains" can be represented by an [[incidence matrix]].  

The matrix includes one row for each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and one column for each element in ''X''.
The entry in a particular row and column is 1 if the corresponding subset contains the corresponding element, and is 0 otherwise.
As each row represents the elements contained in the corresponding subset and each column represents the subsets containing the corresponding element, an incidence matrix effectively provides both the standard and inverse representations.

In the matrix representation, an exact cover is a selection of rows such that each column contains a 1 in exactly one selected row.

For example, the relation "contains" in the [[#Detailed example|detailed example]] above can be represented by a 6×7 incidence matrix:&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Knuth]] in his paper "Dancing Links" gives this example, as equation (3), only with the rows reordered.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Again, the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element is contained in exactly one selected subset, i.e., each column contains a 1 in exactly one selected row, as the highlighting makes clear.

In turn, the incidence matrix can be seen also as describing a [[hypergraph]].  The hypergraph includes one node for each element in ''X'' and one edge for each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;; each node is included in exactly one of the edges forming the cover.

=== Graph representation ===

The relation "contains" can be represented by a [[bipartite graph]].

The vertices of the graph are divided into two disjoint sets, one representing the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and another representing the elements in ''X''.
If a subset contains an element, an edge connects the corresponding vertices in the graph.

In the graph representation, an exact cover is a selection of vertices corresponding to subsets such that each vertex corresponding to an element is connected to exactly one selected vertex.

For example, the relation "contains" in the [[#Detailed example|detailed example]] above can be represented by a bipartite graph with 6+7 = 13 vertices:

[[File:Exact-cover-bigraph-highlighted.svg|none|300px]]

Again, the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element is contained in exactly one selected subset, i.e., the vertex corresponding to each element in ''X'' is connected to exactly one selected vertex, as the highlighting makes clear.

== Equivalent problems ==

Although the canonical exact cover problem involves a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of a set ''X'', the logic does not depend on the presence of subsets containing elements.
An "abstract exact cover problem" arises whenever there is a [[heterogeneous relation]] between two sets ''P'' and ''Q'' and the goal is to select a subset ''P*'' of ''P'' such that each element in ''Q'' is related to ''exactly one'' element in ''P*''.
In general, the elements of ''P'' represent choices and the elements of ''Q'' represent "exactly one" constraints on those choices.

More formally, given a binary relation ''R'' &lt;math&gt;\subseteq &lt;/math&gt; ''P'' × ''Q'' between sets ''P'' and ''Q'', one can call a subset ''P*'' of ''P'' an "abstract exact cover" of ''Q'' if each element in ''Q'' is ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;-related to exactly one element in ''P*''. Here ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[converse relation|converse]] of ''R''.

In general, ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; [[restriction (mathematics)|restricted]] to ''Q'' × ''P*'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from ''Q'' to ''P*'', which maps each element in ''Q'' to the unique element in ''P*'' that is ''R''-related to that element in ''Q''.
This function is [[onto]], unless ''P*'' contains the "empty set," i.e., an element which isn't ''R''-related to any element in ''Q''.

In the canonical exact cover problem, ''P'' is a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of ''X'', ''Q'' is the set ''X'', ''R'' is the binary relation "contains" between subsets and elements, and ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; restricted to ''Q'' × ''P*'' is the function "is contained in" from elements to selected subsets.

== Exact hitting set ==

In [[mathematics]], given a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of a set ''X'', an '''exact hitting set''' ''X*'' is a subset of ''X'' such that each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; contains ''exactly one'' element in ''X*''. One says that each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; '''is hit by''' exactly one element in ''X*''.

In [[computer science]], the '''exact hitting set problem''' is a [[decision problem]] to find an exact hitting set or else determine none exists.

The exact hitting set problem is an abstract exact cover problem.
In the [[#Equivalent problems|notation above]], ''P'' is the set ''X'', ''Q'' is a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of ''X'', ''R'' is the binary relation "is contained in" between elements and subsets, and ''R''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; restricted to ''Q'' × ''P*'' is the function "contains" from subsets to selected elements.

Whereas an exact cover problem involves selecting subsets and the relation "contains" from subsets to elements, an exact hitting set problem involves selecting elements and the relation "is contained in" from elements to subsets.
In a sense, an exact hitting set problem is the inverse of the exact cover problem involving the same set and collection of subsets.

=== Exact hitting set example ===

As in the [[#Detailed example|detailed exact cover example]] above, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; = {''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'', ''F''} be a collection of subsets of a set ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} such that:
* ''A'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, 4, 7};
* ''B'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, 4};
* ''C'' = {4, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;, 7};
* ''D'' = {3, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;, 6};
* ''E'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, 3, 6, 7}; and
* ''F'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, 7}.

Then ''X*'' = {1, 2, 5} is an exact hitting set, since each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; contains exactly one element in ''X*'', as the highlighting makes clear.

Moreover, {1, 2, 5} is the only exact hitting set, as the following argument demonstrates:
Because 2 and 7 are the only elements that hit ''F'', an exact hitting set must contain 2 or 7, but not both.
If an exact hitting set contains 7, then it doesn't contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, as each of these elements are contained in some subset also containing 7.
Then there are no more remaining elements, but {7} is not an exactly hitting set, as it doesn't hit ''B'' or ''D''.
In conclusion, there is no exact hitting set containing 7.
On the other hand, if an exact hitting set contains 2, then it doesn't contain 3, 6, or 7, as each of these elements are contained in some subset also containing 2.
Because 5 is the only remaining element that hits ''D'', the exact hitting set must contain 5.
If an exact hitting set contains 5, then it doesn't contain 4, as both hit ''C''.
Because 1 is the only remaining element that hits ''A'', the exact hitting set must contain 1.
Then there are no more remaining elements, and {1, 2, 5} is indeed an exact hitting set.

Although this example involves the same collection of subsets as the detailed exact cover example above, it is essentially a different problem. In a sense, the exact hitting set problem is the inverse (or transpose or converse) of the corresponding exact cover problem above, as the matrix representation makes clear:

:{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
! !! ''A'' !! ''B'' !! ''C'' !! ''D'' !! ''E'' !! ''F''
|-
! &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
! &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
|-

|-
! &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
| 0 || 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0
|-
! 6
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0
|-
! 7
| 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1
|}

=== Dual example ===

But there is another exact hitting set problem that is essentially the same as the [[#Detailed example|detailed exact cover example]] above, in which numbered elements become subsets and lettered subsets become elements, effectively inverting the relation between subsets and element.

For example, as the subset ''B'' contains the elements 1 and 4 in the exact cover problem, the subsets ''I'' and ''IV'' contain the element ''b'' in the dual exact hitting set problem.

In particular, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; =  {''I'', ''II'', ''III'', ''IV'', ''V'', ''VI'', ''VII''} be a collection of subsets of a set ''X'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'', ''f''} such that:
* ''I'' = {''a'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''b''&lt;/span&gt;}
* ''II'' = {''e'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''f''&lt;/span&gt;}
* ''III'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''d''&lt;/span&gt;, ''e''}
* ''IV'' = {''a'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''b''&lt;/span&gt;, ''c''}
* ''V'' = {''c'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''d''&lt;/span&gt;}
* ''VI'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''d''&lt;/span&gt;, ''e''}
* ''VII'' = {''a'', ''c'', ''e'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''f''&lt;/span&gt;}

Then ''X*'' = {''b'', ''d'', ''f''} is an exact hitting set, since each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; contains (is hit by) exactly one element in ''X*'', as the highlighting makes clear.

The exact hitting set ''X*'' = {''b'', ''d'', ''f''} here is essentially the same as the exact cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} above, as the matrix representation makes clear:

:{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
! !! ''I'' !! ''II'' !! ''III'' !! ''IV'' !! ''V'' !! ''VI'' !! ''VII''
|-
! ''a''
| 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1

| &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0 || 0

|}

== Finding solutions ==

[[Knuth's Algorithm X|Algorithm X]] is the name [[Donald Knuth]] gave for "the most obvious trial-and-error approach" for finding all solutions to the exact cover problem.&lt;ref name="knuth" /&gt; Technically, Algorithm X is a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]], [[Nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterministic]], [[depth-first]], [[backtracking]] [[algorithm]].

When Algorithm X is implemented efficiently using [[Donald Knuth]]'s [[Dancing Links]] technique on a computer, Knuth calls it DLX. DLX uses the matrix representation of the problem, implemented as a series of [[doubly linked list]]s of the 1s of the matrix: each 1 element has a link to the next 1 above, below, to the left, and to the right of itself. (Technically, because the lists are circular, this forms a torus). Because exact cover problems tend to be sparse, this representation is usually much more efficient in both size and processing time required. DLX then uses the [[Dancing Links]] technique to quickly select permutations of rows as possible solutions and to efficiently backtrack (undo) mistaken guesses.&lt;ref name="knuth" /&gt;

== Generalizations ==

In a standard exact cover problem, each constraint must be satisfied exactly once.
It is a simple generalization to relax this requirement slightly and allow for the possibility that some "primary" constraints must be satisfied by ''exactly one'' selection but other "secondary" constraints can be satisfied by ''at most one'' selection.

As Knuth explains, a generalized exact cover problem can be converted to an equivalent exact cover problem by simply appending one row for each secondary column, containing a single 1 in that column.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Knuth explains this simple generalization in his paper "Dancing Links," in particular, in explaining the tetrastick and [[N queens problem|N queens]] problems.&lt;/ref&gt; If in a particular candidate solution a particular secondary column is satisfied, then the added row isn't needed.
But if the secondary column isn't satisfied, as is allowed in the generalized problem but not the standard problem, then the added row can be selected to ensure the column is satisfied.

But Knuth goes on to explain that it is better working with the generalized problem directly, because the generalized algorithm is simpler and faster:
A simple change to his Algorithm X allows secondary columns to be handled directly.

The [[N queens problem]] is an example of a generalized exact cover problem, as the constraints corresponding to the diagonals of the chessboard have a maximum rather than an exact queen count.

== Noteworthy examples ==

Due to its NP-completeness, any problem in NP can be [[reduction (complexity)|reduced]] to exact cover problems, which then can be solved with techniques such as Dancing Links.
However, for some well known problems, the reduction is particularly direct.
For instance, the problem of tiling a board with [[pentominoes]], and solving [[Sudoku]] can both be viewed as exact cover problems.

=== Pentomino tiling ===

{{main|Pentomino}}

The problem of tiling a 60-square board with the 12 different free [[pentominoes]] is an example of an exact cover problem, as [[Donald Knuth]] explains in his paper "Dancing links."&lt;ref name="knuth"&gt;{{cite arxiv | author = [[Donald Knuth|Knuth, Donald]] | title = Dancing links | year = 2000 | eprint = cs/0011047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider the problem of tiling with pentominoes an 8×8 chessboard with the 4 central squares removed:

:{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
| 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18
|-
| 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || 25 || 26 || 27 || 28
|-
| 31 || 32 || 33 || 34 || 35 || 36 || 37 || 38
|-
| 41 || 42 || 43 ||    ||    || 46 || 47 || 48
|-
| 51 || 52 || 53 ||    ||    || 56 || 57 || 58
|-
| 61 || 62 || 63 || 64 || 65 || 66 || 67 || 68
|-
| 71 || 72 || 73 || 74 || 75 || 76 || 77 || 78
|-
| 81 || 82 || 83 || 84 || 85 || 86 || 87 || 88
|}

The problem involves two kinds of constraints:
: '''Pentomino:''' For each of the 12 pentominoes, there is the constraint that it must be placed exactly once. Name these constraints after the corresponding pentominoes: F I L P N T U V W X Y Z.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Golomb | first = Solomon W. | authorlink = Solomon W. Golomb |author2=Warren Lushbaugh | title = Polyominoes: Puzzles, Patterns, Problems, and Packings | edition = 2nd | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-691-02444-8 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: '''Square:''' For each of the 60 squares, there is the constraint that it must be covered by a pentomino exactly once. Name these constraints after the corresponding squares in the board: ''ij'', where ''i'' is the rank and ''j'' is the file.

Thus there are 12+60 = 72 constraints in all.

As both kinds of constraints are "exactly one" constraints, the problem is an exact cover problem.

The problem involves many choices, one for each way to place a pentomino on the board.
It is convenient to consider each choice as satisfying a set of 6 constraints: 1 constraint for the pentomino being placed and 5 constraints for the five squares where it is placed.

In the case of an 8×8 chessboard with the 4 central squares removed, there are 1568 such choices, for example:
* {F, 12, 13, 21, 22, 32}
* {F, 13, 14, 22, 23, 33}
* …
* {I, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
* {I, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}
* …
* {L, 11, 21, 31, 41, 42}
* {L, 12, 22, 32, 42, 43}
* …

One of many solutions of this exact cover problem is the following set of 12 choices:
* {I, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
* {N, 16, 26, 27, 37, 47}
* {L, 17, 18, 28, 38, 48}
* {U, 21, 22, 31, 41, 42}
* {X, 23, 32, 33, 34, 43}
* {W, 24, 25, 35, 36, 46}
* {P, 51, 52, 53, 62, 63}
* {F, 56, 64, 65, 66, 75}
* {Z, 57, 58, 67, 76, 77}
* {T, 61, 71, 72, 73, 81}
* {V, 68, 78, 86, 87, 88}
* {Y, 74, 82, 83, 84, 85}

This set of choices corresponds to the following solution to the pentomino tiling problem:

[[File:Pentomino Puzzle Solution 8x8 Minus Center.svg|none|300px]]

A pentomino tiling problem is more naturally viewed as an exact cover problem than an exact hitting set problem, because it is more natural to view each choice as a set of constraints than each constraint as a set of choices.

Each choice relates to just 6 constraints, which are easy to enumerate. On the other hand, each constraint relates to many choices, which are harder to enumerate.

Whether viewed as an exact cover problem or an exact hitting set problem, the matrix representation is the same, having 1568 rows corresponding to choices and 72 columns corresponding to constraints.
Each row contains a single 1 in the column identifying the pentomino and five 1s in the columns identifying the squares covered by the pentomino.

Using the matrix, a computer can find all solutions relatively quickly, for example, using [[Dancing Links]].

=== Sudoku ===

{{pad|1.2em}}''Main articles: [[Sudoku]], [[Sudoku solving algorithms]]''

The problem in [[Sudoku]] is to assign numbers (or digits, values, symbols) to cells (or squares) in a grid so as to satisfy certain constraints.

In the standard 9×9 Sudoku variant, there are four kinds of constraints:
: '''Row-Column:'''  Each intersection of a row and column, i.e, each cell, must contain exactly one number.
: '''Row-Number:'''  Each row must contain each number exactly once
: '''Column-Number:'''  Each column must contain each number exactly once.
: '''Box-Number:'''  Each box must contain each number exactly once.

While the first constraint might seem trivial, it is nevertheless needed to ensure there is only one number per cell.  Intuitively, placing a number into a cell prohibits placing that number in any other cell sharing the same column, row, or box and also prohibits ''placing any other number'' into the now occupied cell.  

Solving Sudoku is an exact cover problem.

More precisely, solving Sudoku is an exact [[hitting set]] problem, which is equivalent to an exact cover problem, when viewed as a problem to select possibilities such that each constraint set contains (i.e., is hit by) exactly one selected possibility.
In the notation above for the (generalized) exact cover problem, ''X'' is the set of possibilities, ''Y'' is a set of constraint sets, and ''R'' is the binary relation "is contained in."

Each possible assignment of a particular number to a particular cell is a '''possibility''' (or candidate).
When Sudoku is played with pencil and paper, possibilities are often called pencil marks.

In the standard 9×9 Sudoku variant, in which each of 9×9 cells is assigned one of 9 numbers, there are 9×9×9=729 possibilities.
Using obvious notation for rows, columns and numbers, the possibilities can be labeled
: R1C1#1, R1C1#2, …, R9C9#9.

The fact that each kind of constraint involves exactly one of something is what makes Sudoku an exact hitting set problem.
The constraints can be represented by '''constraint sets'''.
The problem is to select possibilities such that each constraint set contains (i.e., is hit by) exactly one selected possibility.

In the standard 9×9 Sudoku variant, there are four kinds of constraints sets corresponding to the four kinds of constraints:

: '''Row-Column:''' A row-column constraint set contains all the possibilities for the intersection of a particular row and column, i.e., for a cell. For example, the constraint set for row 1 and column 1, which can be labeled R1C1, contains the 9 possibilities for row 1 and column 1 but different numbers:
::  R1C1 = { R1C1#1, R1C1#2, R1C1#3, R1C1#4, R1C1#5, R1C1#6, R1C1#7, R1C1#8, R1C1#9 }.

: '''Row-Number:''' A row-number constraint set contains all the possibilities for a particular row and number. For example, the constraint set for row 1 and number 1, which can be labeled R1#1, contains the 9 possibilities for row 1 and number 1 but different columns:
:: R1#1 = { R1C1#1, R1C2#1, R1C3#1, R1C4#1, R1C5#1, R1C6#1, R1C7#1, R1C8#1, R1C9#1 }.

: '''Column-Number:''' A column-number constraint set contains all the possibilities for a particular column and number. For example, the constraint set for column 1 and number 1, which can be labeled C1#1, contains the 9 possibilities for column 1 and number 1 but different rows:
:: C1#1 = { R1C1#1, R2C1#1, R3C1#1, R4C1#1, R5C1#1, R6C1#1, R7C1#1, R8C1#1, R9C1#1 }.

: '''Box-Number:''' A box-number constraint set contains all the possibilities for a particular box and number. For example, the constraint set for box 1 (in the upper lefthand corner) and number 1, which can be labeled B1#1, contains the 9 possibilities for the cells in box 1 and number 1:
:: B1#1 = { R1C1#1, R1C2#1, R1C3#1, R2C1#1, R2C2#1, R2C3#1, R3C1#1, R3C2#1, R3C3#1 }.

Since there are 9 rows, 9 columns, 9 boxes and 9 numbers, there are 9×9=81 row-column constraint sets, 9×9=81 row-number constraint sets,  9×9=81 column-number constraint sets,  and 9×9=81 box-number constraint sets: 81+81+81+81=324 constraint sets in all.

In brief, the standard 9×9 Sudoku variant is an exact hitting set problem with 729 possibilities and 324 constraint sets.
Thus the problem can be represented by a 729×324 matrix.

Although it is difficult to present the entire 729×324 matrix, the general nature of the matrix can be seen from several snapshots:

The [http://www.stolaf.edu/people/hansonr/sudoku/exactcovermatrix.htm complete 729×324 matrix] is available from Bob Hanson.

Note that the set of possibilities R''x''C''y''#''z'' can be arranged as a 9×9×9 cube in a 3-dimensional space with coordinates ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''.
Then each row R''x'', column C''y'', or number #''z'' is a 9×9×1 "slice" of possibilities; each box B''w'' is a 9x3×3 "tube" of possibilities; each row-column constraint set R''x''C''y'', row-number constraint set R''x''#''z'', or column-number constraint set C''y''#''z'' is a 9x1×1 "strip" of possibilities; each box-number constraint set B''w''#''z'' is a 3x3×1 "square" of possibilities; and each possibility R''x''C''y''#''z'' is a 1x1×1 "cubie" consisting of a single possibility.
Moreover, each constraint set or possibility is the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the component sets.
For example, R1C2#3 = R1 ∩ C2 ∩ #3, where ∩ denotes set intersection.

Although other Sudoku variations have different numbers of rows, columns, numbers and/or different kinds of constraints, they all involve possibilities and constraint sets, and thus can be seen as exact hitting set problems.

=== ''N'' queens problem ===
 {{main|N queens problem}}
 {{Expand section|date=July 2008}}

The [[N queens problem|''N'' queens problem]] is an example of a generalized exact cover problem.&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt; The problem involves four kinds of constraints:
: '''Rank:''' For each of the ''N'' ranks, there must be exactly one queen.
: '''File:''' For each of the ''N'' files, there must be exactly one queen.
: '''Diagonals:''' For each of the 2''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 diagonals, there must be at most one queen.
: '''Reverse diagonals:''' For each of the 2''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 reverse diagonals, there must be at most one queen.

Note that the 2''N'' rank and file constraints form the primary constraints, while the 4''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 diagonal and reverse diagonals form the secondary constraints. Further, because each of first and last diagonal and reverse diagonals involves only one square on the chessboard, these can be omitted and thus one can reduce the number of secondary constraints to 4''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;6. The matrix for the ''N'' queens problem then has ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; rows and 6''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;6 columns, each row for a possible queen placement on each square on the chessboard, and each column for each constraint.

In the theory of [[dynamical system]]s, the '''exponential map''' can be used as the [[Dynamical system (definition)|evolution function]] of [[Recurrence relation|the discrete nonlinear dynamical system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://macau.uni-kiel.de/receive/dissertation_diss_00000781 Dynamics of exponential maps by Lasse Rempe]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
The family of [[exponential function]]s is called the '''exponential family'''.

==Forms==
There are many '''forms''' of these maps,&lt;ref&gt;[http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0805.1658 [[Lasse Rempe]], Dierk Schleicher : Bifurcation Loci of Exponential Maps and Quadratic Polynomials: Local Connectivity, Triviality of Fibers, and Density of Hyperbolicity]&lt;/ref&gt; many of which are equivalent under a coordinate transformation. For example two of the most common ones are:

*&lt;math&gt;E_c : z \to e^z + c &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;E_\lambda : z \to \lambda * e^z&lt;/math&gt;

The second one can be mapped to the first using the fact that &lt;math&gt;\lambda * e^z. = e^{z+ln(\lambda)}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;E_\lambda : z \to e^z + ln(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the same under the transformation &lt;math&gt;z=z+ln(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;. The only difference is that, due to multi-valued properties of exponentiation, there may be a few select cases that can only be found in one version. Similar arguments can be made for many other formulas.

In [[mathematics]], the '''affinely extended real number system''' is obtained from the [[real number]] system {{math|ℝ}} by adding two elements: {{math|+&amp;#8239;∞}} and {{math|–&amp;#8239;∞}} (read as '''positive [[infinity]]''' and '''negative infinity''' respectively). These new elements are not real numbers. It is useful in describing various [[limit of a function|limiting behavior]]s in [[calculus]] and [[mathematical analysis]], especially in the theory of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] and [[integral|integration]]. The affinely extended real number system is denoted &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--{{math|{{overset|—|ℝ}}}}--&gt; or {{math|[–∞, +∞]}} or {{math|ℝ ∪ {–∞, +∞}|}}.

When the meaning is clear from context, the symbol {{math|+∞}} is often written simply as {{math|∞}}.

==Motivation==
===Limits===

We often wish to describe the behavior of a function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, as either the argument &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or the function value &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; gets "very big" in some sense. For example, consider the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^{-2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The graph of this function has a horizontal [[asymptote]] at y&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Geometrically, as we move farther and farther to the right along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis, the value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; approaches 0. This limiting behavior is similar to the [[limit of a function]] at a [[real number]], except that there is no real number to which &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches.

By adjoining the elements &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, we allow a formulation of a "limit at infinity" with [[topology|topological]] properties similar to those for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

To make things completely formal, the [[Construction of the real numbers#Construction from Cauchy sequences|Cauchy sequences definition]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; allows us to define &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; as the set of all sequences of rationals which, for any &lt;math&gt;K&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, from some point on exceed &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. We can define &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; similarly.

===Measure and integration===

In [[measure theory]], it is often useful to allow sets that have infinite measure and integrals whose value may be infinite.

Such measures arise naturally out of calculus. For example, in assigning a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; that agrees with the usual length of intervals, this measure must be larger than any finite real number. Also, when considering [[improper integral]]s, such as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_1^{\infty}\frac{dx}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

the value "infinity" arises. Finally, it is often useful to consider the limit of a sequence of functions, such as      

:&lt;math&gt;f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 2n(1-nx), &amp; \mbox{if } 0 \le x \le \frac{1}{n} \\ 0, &amp; \mbox{if } \frac{1}{n} &lt; x \le 1\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; 

Without allowing functions to take on infinite values, such essential results as the [[monotone convergence theorem]] and the [[dominated convergence theorem]] would not make sense.

==Order and topological properties==

The affinely extended real number system turns into a [[totally ordered set]] by defining &lt;math&gt;-\infty\leq a \leq +\infty&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. This order has the desirable property that every subset has a [[supremum]] and an [[infimum]]: it is a [[complete lattice]].

This induces the [[order topology]] on &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;. In this topology, a set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it contains a set &lt;math&gt;\{x : x &gt; a\}&lt;/math&gt; for some real number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and analogously for the neighborhoods of &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[unit interval]] &lt;math&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the topology is [[metrizable]], corresponding (for a given homeomorphism) to the ordinary metric on this interval. There is no metric that is an extension of the ordinary metric on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

With this topology the specially defined [[Limit of a function|limits]] for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tending to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and the specially defined concepts of limits equal to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, reduce to the general topological definitions of limits.

==Arithmetic operations==

The arithmetic operations of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; can be partially extended to &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a + \infty = +\infty + a &amp; = +\infty, &amp; a &amp; \neq -\infty \\
a - \infty = -\infty + a &amp; = -\infty, &amp; a &amp; \neq +\infty \\
a \cdot (\pm\infty) = \pm\infty \cdot a &amp; = \pm\infty, &amp; a &amp; \in (0, +\infty] \\
a \cdot (\pm\infty) = \pm\infty \cdot a &amp; = \mp\infty, &amp; a &amp; \in [-\infty, 0) \\
\frac{a}{\pm\infty} &amp; = 0, &amp; a &amp; \in \mathbb{R} \\
\frac{\pm\infty}{a} &amp; = \pm\infty, &amp; a &amp; \in (0, +\infty) \\
\frac{\pm\infty}{a} &amp; = \mp\infty, &amp; a &amp; \in (-\infty, 0)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For exponentiation, see [[Exponentiation#Limits of powers]].
Here, "&lt;math&gt;a + \infty&lt;/math&gt;" means both "&lt;math&gt;a + (+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;" and "&lt;math&gt;a - (-\infty)&lt;/math&gt;", while "&lt;math&gt;a - \infty&lt;/math&gt;" means both "&lt;math&gt;a - (+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;" and {{nowrap|"&lt;math&gt;a + (-\infty)&lt;/math&gt;".}}

The expressions &lt;math&gt;\infty - \infty, 0 \times (\pm\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pm\infty/\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt; (called [[indeterminate form]]s) are usually left [[Defined and undefined|undefined]]. These rules are modeled on the laws for [[Limit_of_a_function#Limits_involving_infinity|infinite limits]]. However, in the context of probability or measure theory, &lt;math&gt;0 \times \pm\infty&lt;/math&gt; is often defined as &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The expression &lt;math&gt;1/0&lt;/math&gt; is not defined either as &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, because although it is true that whenever &lt;math&gt;f(x) \to 0&lt;/math&gt; for a [[continuous function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; it must be the case that &lt;math&gt;1/f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is eventually contained in every [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of the set &lt;math&gt;\{-\infty, +\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;, it is ''not'' true that &lt;math&gt;1/f(x)&lt;/math&gt; must tend to one of these points. An example is &lt;math&gt;g(x) = 1/\sin (1/x)&lt;/math&gt; which is of the form &lt;math&gt;1/f(x)&lt;/math&gt; but does not tend to either &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\sin (1/x) \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 1/\pi}{\sin (1/x)} = 0&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 1/\pi}{{1} \over {\sin (1/x)}}&lt;/math&gt; does not exist because &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to {1/\pi}^+}{{1} \over {\sin (1/x)}} = +\infty&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to {1/\pi}^-}{{1} \over {\sin (1/x)}} = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;. (The [[absolute value|modulus]] &lt;math&gt;|1/f(x)|&lt;/math&gt;, nevertheless, does approach &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;.)

==Algebraic properties==

With these definitions &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is '''not''' even a [[semigroup]], let alone a [[group (mathematics)|group]], a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] or a [[field (mathematics)|field]], like &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is one. However, it still has several convenient properties:
* &lt;math&gt;a + (b + c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a + b) + c&lt;/math&gt; are either equal or both undefined.
* &lt;math&gt;a + b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b + a&lt;/math&gt; are either equal or both undefined.
* &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b \cdot c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a \cdot b) \cdot c&lt;/math&gt; are either equal or both undefined.
* &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \cdot a&lt;/math&gt; are either equal or both undefined
* &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b + c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)&lt;/math&gt; are equal if both are defined.
* If &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; and if both &lt;math&gt;a + c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b + c&lt;/math&gt; are defined, then &lt;math&gt;a + c \leq b + c&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and if both &lt;math&gt;a \cdot c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \cdot c&lt;/math&gt; are defined, then &lt;math&gt;a \cdot c \leq b \cdot c&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, all laws of arithmetic are valid in &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as long as all occurring expressions are defined.

==Miscellaneous==

Several [[function (mathematics)|functions]] can be [[continuity (topology)|continuously]] extended to &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; by taking limits. For instance, one defines &lt;math&gt;\exp(-\infty) = 0, \exp(+\infty) = +\infty, \ln(0) = -\infty, \ln(+\infty) = +\infty&lt;/math&gt; etc.

Some [[Singularity (mathematics)|singularities]] may additionally be removed. For example, the function &lt;math&gt;1/x^2&lt;/math&gt; can be continuously extended to &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (under ''some'' definitions of continuity) by setting the value to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x = +\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; can ''not'' be continuously extended because the function approaches &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 0 from below, and &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; from above.

Compare the [[projectively extended real line]], which does not distinguish between &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, on one hand a function may have limit &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; on the projectively extended real line, while in the affinely extended real number system only the absolute value of the function has a limit, e.g. in the case of the function &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to -\infty}{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to +\infty}{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
correspond on the projectively extended real line to only a limit from the right and one from the left, respectively, with the full limit only existing when the two are equal. Thus  &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\arctan(x)&lt;/math&gt; cannot be made continuous at &lt;math&gt;x = \infty&lt;/math&gt; on the projectively extended real line.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8269">'''Formal equivalence checking''' process is a part of [[electronic design automation]] (EDA), commonly used during the development of [[digital circuit|digital]] [[integrated circuit]]s, to formally prove that two representations of a [[circuit design]] exhibit exactly the same behavior.

== Equivalence checking and levels of abstraction ==

In general, there is a wide range of possible definitions of functional equivalence covering comparisons between different [[level of abstraction|levels of abstraction]] and varying granularity of timing details. 
*The most common approach is to consider the problem of machine equivalence which defines two [[Synchronous circuit|synchronous design]] specifications functionally equivalent if, clock by clock, they produce ''exactly'' the same sequence of output signals for ''any'' valid sequence of input signals. 
*[[Microprocessor]] designers use equivalence checking to compare the functions specified for the [[instruction set]] architecture (ISA) with a [[register transfer level]] (RTL) implementation, ensuring that any program executed on both models will cause an identical update of the main memory content.  This is a more general problem.
*A system design flow requires comparison between a transaction level model (TLM), e.g., written in [[SystemC]] and its corresponding RTL specification. Such a check is becoming of increasing interest in a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design environment.

== Synchronous machine equivalence ==
The [[register transfer level]] (RTL) behavior of a digital chip is usually described with a [[hardware description language]], such as [[Verilog]] or [[VHDL]]. This description is the golden reference model that describes in detail which operations will be executed during which [[clock cycle]] and by which pieces of hardware. Once the logic designers, by simulations and other verification methods, have verified register transfer description, the design is usually converted into a [[netlist]] by a [[logic synthesis]] tool. Equivalence is not to be confused with functional correctness, which must be determined by [[functional verification]].

The initial [[netlist]] will usually undergo a number of transformations such as optimization, addition of [[Design For Test]] (DFT) structures, etc., before it is used as the basis for the placement of the logic elements into a [[physical layout]]. Contemporary physical design software will occasionally also make significant modifications (such as replacing logic elements with equivalent similar elements that have a higher or lower [[drive strength and/or area]]) to the netlist. Throughout every step of a very complex, multi-step procedure, the original functionality and the behavior described by the original code must be maintained. When the final [[tape-out]] is made of a digital chip, many different EDA programs and possibly some manual edits will have altered the netlist.

In theory, a logic synthesis tool guarantees that the first netlist is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the RTL source code.  All the programs later in the process that make changes to the netlist also, in theory, ensure that these changes are logically equivalent to a previous version.

In practice, programs have bugs and it would be a major risk to assume that all steps from RTL through the final tape-out netlist have been performed without error. Also, in real life, it is common for designers to make manual changes to a netlist, commonly known as [[Engineering Change Order]]s, or ECOs, thereby introducing a major additional error factor.    Therefore, instead of blindly assuming that no mistakes were made, a verification step is needed to check the logical equivalence of the final version of the netlist to the original description of the design (golden reference model).

Historically, one way to check the equivalence was to re-simulate, using the final netlist, the test cases that were developed for verifying the correctness of the RTL. This process is called gate level [[logic simulation]]. However, the problem with this is that the quality of the check is only as good as the quality of the test cases. Also, gate-level simulations are notoriously slow to execute, which is a major problem as the size of digital designs continues to grow [[exponent]]ially.

An alternative way to solve this is to formally prove that the RTL code and the netlist synthesized from it have exactly the same behavior in all (relevant) cases. This process is called formal equivalence checking and is a problem that is studied under the broader area of [[formal verification]].

A formal equivalence check can be performed between any two representations of a design: RTL &lt;&gt; netlist, netlist &lt;&gt; netlist or RTL &lt;&gt; RTL, though the latter is rare compared to the first two. Typically, a formal equivalence checking tool will also indicate with great precision at which point there exists a difference between two representations.

== Methods ==
There are two basic technologies used for boolean reasoning in equivalence checking programs:
*[[Binary decision diagram]]s, or BDDs: A specialized data structure designed to support reasoning about boolean functions. BDDs have become highly popular because of their efficiency and versatility.
*Conjunctive Normal Form Satisfiability: [[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT]] solvers returns an assignment to the variables of a [[propositional formula]] that satisfies it if such an assignment exists.  Almost any boolean reasoning problem can be expressed as a SAT problem.

== Commercial applications for equivalence checking ==
Major products in the Logic Equivalence Checking (''LEC'') area of ''EDA'' are:

* ''FormalPro'' by [[Mentor Graphics]]
* ''Questa SLEC'' by [[Mentor Graphics]]
* ''Conformal'' by [[Cadence Design Systems|Cadence]]
* ''JasperGold'' by [[Cadence Design Systems|Cadence]]
* ''Formality'' by [[Synopsys]]
* ''VC Formal'' by [[Synopsys]]
* ''360 EC'' by [[OneSpin Solutions]]
* ''ATEC'' by [[ATEC Technologies, Inc.|ATEC]]

== Generalizations ==
*Equivalence Checking of Retimed Circuits:  Sometimes it is helpful to move logic from one side of a register to another, and this complicates the checking problem.
*Sequential Equivalence Checking:  Sometimes, two machines are completely different at the combinational level, but should give the same outputs if given the same inputs.  The classic example is two identical state machines with different encodings for the states. Since this cannot be reduced to a combinational problem, more general techniques are required.
*Equivalence of Software Programs, i.e. checking if two well-defined programs that take N inputs and produce M outputs are equivalent:  Conceptually, you can turn software into a state machine (that's what the combination of a compiler does, since a computer plus its memory form a very large state machine.)  Then, in theory, various forms of property checking can ensure they produce the same output.  This problem is even harder than sequential equivalence checking, since the outputs of the two programs may appear at different times; but it is possible, and researchers are working on it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3209">The term '''generalized logistic distribution''' is used as the name for several different families of [[probability distributions]]. For example, Johnson et al.&lt;ref name=J1&gt;Johnson, N.L., Kotz, S., Balakrishnan, N. (1995) ''Continuous Univariate Distributions, Volume 2'', Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-58494-0}} (pages 140–142)&lt;/ref&gt; list four forms, which are listed below. One family described here has also been called the '''skew-logistic distribution'''. For other families of distributions that have also been called generalized logistic distributions, see the [[Log-logistic distribution#Shifted log-logistic distribution|shifted log-logistic distribution]], which is a generalization of the [[log-logistic distribution]].

==Definitions==

The following definitions are for standardized versions of the families, which can be expanded to the full form as a [[location-scale family]]. Each is defined using either the [[cumulative distribution function]] (''F'') or the [[probability density function]] (''&amp;fnof;''), and is defined on (-∞,∞).

===Type I===
:&lt;math&gt;F(x;\alpha)=\frac{1}{(1+e^{-x})^\alpha} \equiv (1+e^{-x})^{-\alpha}, \quad \alpha &gt; 0 .&lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding probability density function is:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x;\alpha)=\frac{\alpha e^{-x}}{\left(1+e^{-x}\right)^{\alpha+1}}, \quad \alpha &gt; 0 .&lt;/math&gt;
This type has also been called the "skew-logistic" distribution.

===Type II ===
:&lt;math&gt;F(x;\alpha)=1-\frac{e^{-\alpha x}}{(1+e^{-x})^\alpha}, \quad \alpha &gt; 0 .&lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding probability density function is:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x;\alpha)=\frac{\alpha e^{-\alpha x}}{(1+e^{-x})^{\alpha+1}}, \quad \alpha &gt; 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

===Type III ===
:&lt;math&gt;f(x;\alpha)=\frac{1}{B(\alpha,\alpha)}\frac{e^{-\alpha x}}{(1+e^{-x})^{2\alpha}}, \quad \alpha &gt; 0 .&lt;/math&gt;
Here ''B'' is the [[beta function]]. The [[moment generating function]] for this type is
:&lt;math&gt;M(t)=\frac{\Gamma(\alpha-t) \Gamma(\alpha+t) }{ (\Gamma(\alpha))^2 }, \quad -\alpha&lt;t&lt;\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding cumulative distribution function is:
:&lt;math&gt;F(x;\alpha)= \frac{\left(e^x+1\right) \Gamma (\alpha ) e^{\alpha  (-x)} \left(e^{-x}+1\right)^{-2 \alpha }
   \, _2\tilde{F}_1\left(1,1-\alpha ;\alpha +1;-e^x\right)}{B(\alpha ,\alpha )}, \quad \alpha &gt; 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

===Type IV ===
:&lt;math&gt;f(x;\alpha,\beta)=\frac{1}{B(\alpha,\beta)}\frac{e^{-\beta x}}{(1+e^{-x})^{\alpha+\beta}}, \quad \alpha,\beta &gt; 0 .&lt;/math&gt;
Again, ''B'' is the [[beta function]]. The [[moment generating function]] for this type is
:&lt;math&gt;M(t)=\frac{\Gamma(\beta-t) \Gamma(\alpha+t) }{ \Gamma(\alpha) \Gamma(\beta) }, \quad -\alpha&lt;t&lt;\beta.&lt;/math&gt; 
This type is also called the "exponential generalized beta of the second type".&lt;ref name=J1/&gt;

The corresponding cumulative distribution function is:
:&lt;math&gt;F(x;\alpha,\beta)= \frac{\left(e^x+1\right) \Gamma (\alpha ) e^{\beta  (-x)} \left(e^{-x}+1\right)^{-\alpha -\beta
   } \, _2\tilde{F}_1\left(1,1-\beta ;\alpha +1;-e^x\right)}{B(\alpha ,\beta )} , \quad \alpha,\beta &gt; 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2906">In [[mathematics]], the '''Halpern–Läuchli theorem''' is a partition result about finite products of infinite [[Tree (set theory)|trees]]. Its original purpose was to give a model for set theory in which the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]] is true but the [[axiom of choice]] is false. It is often called the Halpern–Läuchli theorem, but the proper attribution for the theorem as it is formulated below is to Halpern–Läuchli–Laver–Pincus or HLLP (named after James D. Halpern, Hans Läuchli, [[Richard Laver]], and David Pincus), following {{harvtxt|Milliken|1979}}.

Let d,r &amp;lt; ω, &lt;math&gt;\langle T_i: i \in d \rangle&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of finitely splitting trees of height ω. Let 

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n \in \omega} \left(\prod_{i&lt;d}T_i(n)\right) = C_1 \cup \cdots \cup C_r,&lt;/math&gt;

then there exists a sequence of subtrees &lt;math&gt;\langle S_i: i \in d \rangle&lt;/math&gt; [[Milliken's tree theorem|strongly embedded]] in &lt;math&gt;\langle T_i: i \in d \rangle&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n \in \omega} \left(\prod_{i&lt;d}S_i(n)\right) \subset C_k\text{ for some }k \le r. &lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, let

: &lt;math&gt;S^d_{\langle T_i: i \in d \rangle} = \bigcup_{n \in \omega} \left(\prod_{i&lt;d}T_i(n)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^d=\bigcup_{\langle T_i: i \in d \rangle} S^d_{\langle T_i: i \in d \rangle}.&lt;/math&gt;.

The HLLP theorem says that not only is the collection &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^d&lt;/math&gt; [[partition regular]] for each ''d''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''ω'', but that the homogeneous subtree guaranteed by the theorem is '''strongly embedded''' in

:&lt;math&gt;T= \langle T_i: i \in d \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Herbert Marsh''' [[Doctor of Divinity|DD]] (10 December 1757 – 1 May 1839) was a bishop in the [[Church of England]].

==Life==
The son of Richard Marsh (1709–1779), Vicar of [[Faversham]] in Kent, Marsh was born there and educated at [[Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Faversham|Faversham Grammar School]], [[the King's School, Canterbury]], and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he graduated BA as [[second wrangler]] and was elected a fellow of St John's in 1779, the year of the death of his father. He won prizes in 1780 and 1781, proceeded to MA in 1782 and to [[Bachelor of Divinity]] in 1792.&lt;ref name=acad&gt;{{acad|id=MRS774H|name=Marsh, Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While retaining his fellowship at St John's, Marsh studied with [[J. D. Michaelis]] at [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and learned the [[higher criticism]]. When he returned to England, he translated Michaelis's ''Introduction to the New Testament'' and added to it his own hypothesis on the problem of the [[synoptic problem|Synoptic Gospels]]. Arguing from textual analysis, he advanced a [[proto-gospel hypothesis]], a variant and modification of the contemporary claim by [[Johann Gottfried Eichhorn]]. His ''Dissertation'' (1801) deduced that there had been an original Aramaean gospel-narrative which had been translated into Greek, and had been circulated in copies into which additional information was afterwards added or interpolated. St Mark (he claimed) had had access to two such copies containing variant additions (some of which had been interpolated into those texts), and drew upon both copies when compiling his own Gospel. These same two copies each then independently received further additions (from a ''Gnomology'' or Hebrew document of sayings and precepts of Christ), before one of them was employed by St Matthew, and the other by St Luke, when compiling their Gospels. He drew in the claim that St Matthew's Gospel had originally been written in Hebrew, and that when it was afterwards translated into Greek the translator was able to make use of passages for which he found existing Greek versions in St Mark and St Luke. His hypothesis, now itself superseded, in its time offered a challenge to the conventional or received explanations. It brought him under attack from the conservatives of his church, and into a published debate&lt;ref&gt;'Remarks on "Michaelis's Introduction to the New Testament, Vols III &amp; IV, Translated by the Rev. Herbert Marsh, and Augmented with Notes." – By way of Caution to Students in Divinity' 2nd Edn.,, with a Preface and Notes, in Reply to Mr Marsh (White, Hatchard, Wallis, etc, London 1802); 'Supplement to Remarks on Michaelis's Introduction to The New Testament, &amp;c., in answer to Mr Marsh's Illustration of his Hypothesis' (White, Payne &amp; Mackinlay, and Hatchard, London 1804).&lt;/ref&gt; with [[John Randolph (bishop of London)|John Randolph]], then Bishop of Oxford and Regius Professor of Greek in the University of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;For the identity of Marsh's principal antagonist, see W.T. Lowndes, ''British Librarian: To the Formation of a Library in All Branches of Literature, Science and Art'' (Whittaker &amp; Co., London 1839), Vol. 1 (Class I: Religion and its History), pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1807 he resigned his fellowship at St John's on being elected as the [[Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity]] at Cambridge and began presenting lectures there on Higher Criticism.  He was the first person in the theological school there to give his lectures in English rather than the traditional Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Neill ''The Interpretation of the New Testament'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1808 he was awarded the Oxford degree of [[Doctor of Divinity]], before in 1816 he was appointed the [[bishop of Llandaff]].

As a bishop, Marsh was controversial for preaching against the Evangelicals and for refusing to license clergy with Calvinist beliefs (for which he incurred the ire of [[Sydney Smith]]).  He was a rigorous proponent of strict ecclesiastical conformity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8904">{{for|Perelman's generalization of Thurston's geometrization theorem to all 3-manifolds|Thurston conjecture}}
In [[geometry]], [[William Thurston|Thurston's]] '''geometrization theorem''' or '''hyperbolization theorem'''  implies that closed atoroidal  [[Haken manifold]]s are hyperbolic, and in particular  satisfy the [[Thurston conjecture]].

==Statement==

One form of Thurston's geometrization theorem states:
If ''M'' is a compact irreducible atoroidal Haken manifold whose boundary has zero Euler characteristic, then the interior of ''M'' has a complete hyperbolic structure of finite volume.

The [[Mostow rigidity theorem]] implies that if a manifold of dimension at least 3 has a hyperbolic structure of finite volume, then it is essentially unique.

The conditions that the manifold ''M'' should be irreducible and atoroidal are necessary, as hyperbolic manifolds have these properties. However the condition that the manifold be Haken is unnecessarily strong. Thurston's hyperbolization conjecture states that a  closed irreducible atoroidal 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group is hyperbolic, and this follows from Perelman's proof of the Thurston geometrization conjecture.

==Manifolds with boundary==

{{harvtxt|Thurston|1982|loc=2.3}}  showed that if a compact 3 manifold is prime, homotopically atoroidal, and has non-empty boundary, then it has a complete hyperbolic structure unless it is homeomorphic to a certain manifold (''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;[0,1])/'''Z'''/2'''Z''' with boundary&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

A hyperbolic structure on the interior of a compact orientable 3-manifold has finite volume if and only if all boundary components are tori, except for the manifold  ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;[0,1] which has a hyperbolic structure but none of finite volume {{harv|Thurston|1982|p=359}}.

==Proofs==

Thurston never published a complete proof of his theorem for reasons that he explained in {{harv|Thurston|1994}}, though parts of his argument are contained in {{harvs|txt|last=Thurston|year1=1986|year2=1998a|year3=1998b}}. {{harvtxt|Wall|1984}} and {{harvtxt|Morgan|1984}} gave summaries of Thurston's proof. {{harvtxt|Otal|1996}} gave a proof in the case of manifolds that fiber over the circle, and {{harvtxt|Otal|1998}} and {{harvtxt|Kapovich|2009}} gave proofs for the generic case of manifolds that do not fiber over the circle. Thurston's geometrization theorem also follows from Perelman's proof using [[Ricci flow]] of the more general [[Thurston geometrization conjecture]].

==Manifolds that fiber over the circle==

Thurston's original argument for this case was summarized by {{harvtxt|Sullivan|1979}}. 
{{harvtxt|Otal|1996}} gave a proof in the case of manifolds that fiber over the circle.

Thurston's geometrization theorem in this special case states that if ''M'' is a 3-manifold that fibers over the circle and whose monodromy is a [[pseudo-Anosov]] diffeomorphism, then the interior of ''M'' has a complete hyperbolic metric of finite volume.

==Manifolds that do not fiber over the circle==

{{harvtxt|Otal|1998}} and {{harvtxt|Kapovich|2009}} gave proofs of Thurston's theorem for the generic case of manifolds that do not fiber over the circle.

The idea of the proof is to cut a Haken manifold ''M'' along an incompressible surface, to obtain a new manifold ''N''. By induction one assumes that the interior of ''N'' has a hyperbolic structure, and the problem is to modify it so that it can be extended to the boundary of ''N'' and glued together. Thurston showed that this follows from the existence of a fixed point for a map of Teichmuller space called the '''skinning map'''. The core of the proof of the geometrization theorem is to prove that if ''N'' is not an interval bundle over an interval and ''M'' is an atoroidal then the skinning map has a fixed point. (If ''N'' is an interval bundle then the skinning map has no fixed point, which is why one needs a separate argument when ''M'' fibers over the circle.) {{harvtxt|McMullen|1990}} gave a new proof of the existence of a fixed point of the skinning map.

  predicament of the other."
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term was also used by [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) in his book ''System of Positive Polity'' (published 1875), stating, "Inevitable increase in Complication, in proportion with the decrease of Generality, gives rise to two inverse consequences."

'''Isabella Grigoryevna Bashmakova''' ({{lang-ru|Изабелла Григорьевна Башмакова}}, 1921–2005) was a Russian [[history of mathematics|historian of mathematics]].

==Education and career==
Bashmakova was born on January 3, 1921, in [[Rostov-on-Don]], to a family of Armenian descent. Her father, Grigory Georgiyevich Bashmakov, was a lawyer. Her family moved to [[Moscow]] in 1932. She began studies in the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics at [[Moscow State University]] in 1938, but was evacuated from Moscow during [[World War II]], during which she served as a nurse in [[Samarkand]].&lt;ref name="agd60"&gt;{{citation

She continued at Moscow State as an assistant professor, and in 1949 was promoted to associate professor. In 1950 her husband, mathematician Andrei I. Lapin, was arrested for his opposition to [[Lysenkoism]], but in part due to Bashmakova's efforts he was freed again in 1952.&lt;ref name="dps80"&gt;{{citation

She retired and become a [[professor emeritus]] in 1999, and died on July 17, 2005 while vacationing in [[Zvenigorod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Contributions==
Bashmakova's dissertation concerned the history of definitions of [[integer]]s and [[rational number]]s, from [[Euclid]] and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] to [[Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev|Zolotarev]], [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]], and [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]].&lt;ref name="agd60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dpy60"/&gt;

Her later research contributions include a comparison of the tools used by [[Diophantus]] to solve [[Diophantine equation]], versus more modern methods; following a line of thought suggested by [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]], she suggested that Diophantus' methods were more sophisticated than previously thought, but that their sophistication had been hidden by the emphasis on specific cases in Diophantus's writings. She used [[complex number]]s to reinterpret the geometric transformations studied by [[François Viète]].&lt;ref name="agd60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dpy60"/&gt; She has also studied the history of [[algebraic curve]]s, and translated the works of [[Fermat]] into Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Recognition==
In 1986, the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] initially published a list of speakers that included no women. After protests, the executive committee of the congress invited six women to speak at the congress. Bashmakova was one of those six; she was unable to travel to the congress, but her paper appears in its proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Complexities: Women in Mathematics|contribution=Across Borders|first1=Bettye Anne|last1=Case|author1-link=Bettye Anne Case|first2=Anne M.|last2=Leggett|author2-link=Anne M.

See in particular [https://books.google.com/books?id=7LQHEe157GQC&amp;pg=PA122 p.&amp;nbsp;122].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Academy of the History of Science]] elected her as a corresponding member in 1966, and a full member in 1971.&lt;ref name="agd60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dpy60"/&gt; She was awarded honorary diplomas in 1971, 1976, and 1980.&lt;ref name="dps80"/&gt; In 2001, she was awarded the Alexander Koyré́ Medal of the International Academy of the History of Science.&lt;ref name="dps80"/&gt; In 2011, a conference of the Russian Academy of Sciences was dedicated in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The '''''Journal of Integer Sequences''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[open access|open-access]] [[academic journal]] in mathematics, specializing in research papers about [[integer sequence]]s.

It was founded in 1998 by [[Neil Sloane]].&lt;ref name="eej"/&gt; Sloane had previously published two books on integer sequences, and in 1996 he founded the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] (OEIS). Needing an outlet for research papers concerning the sequences he was collecting in OEIS, he founded the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.research.att.com/articles/featured_stories/2012_03/201203_OEIS.html|title=The Achievement of The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=[[AT&amp;T Labs Research]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=2015-08-29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://oeis.org/FAZ2.html|title=Die Leidenschaft eines Zahlenreihen-Sammlers|trans-title=The Passion of a Collector of Number Sequences|newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=May 9, 2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002 the journal has been hosted by the [[David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science]] at the [[University of Waterloo]], with Waterloo professor [[Jeffrey Shallit]] as its editor-in-chief. There are no page charges for authors, and all papers are free to all readers. The journal publishes approximately 50–75 papers annually.&lt;ref name="eej"&gt;{{citation

In most years from 1999 to 2014, [[SCImago Journal Rank]] has ranked the ''Journal of Integer Sequences'' as a third-quartile journal in [[discrete mathematics]] and [[combinatorics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23914&amp;tip=sid|title=SCImagoJR report: ''Journal of Integer Sequences''|accessdate=2015-08-29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is indexed by ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/journaldoc.html?jc=JINTS|title=Journal information for the Journal of Integer Sequences|publisher=[[MathSciNet]]|accessdate=2015-08-29}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zentralblatt MATH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://zbmath.org/journals/?s=0&amp;q=journal+of+integer+sequences|title=Zentralblatt MATH: Journal of Integer Sequences|publisher=[[Zentralblatt MATH]]|accessdate=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7266">'''Kaidā glyphs''' ({{nihongo|''Kaidā ji''|カイダー字}}) are a set of [[pictogram]]s once used in the [[Yaeyama Islands]] of southwestern [[Japan]]. The word ''kaidā'' was taken from [[Yonaguni language|Yonaguni]], and most studies on the pictographs focused on [[Yonaguni Island]]. However, there is evidence for their use in Yaeyama's other islands, most notably on [[Taketomi Island]].&lt;ref name="uesedo1976"&gt;{{cite book |author=Uesedo Tōru 上勢頭亨 |title=Taketomi-jima shi minwa min'yō hen 竹富島誌 民話・民俗篇 |year=1976 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used primarily for tax notices, thus were closely associated with the [[poll tax]] imposed on Yaeyama by [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryūkyū]] on Okinawa Island, which was in turn dominated by [[Satsuma Domain]] on Southern Kyushu.

[[Image:Kaidā logograms.svg|thumb|200px|Examples of Kaidā logograms&lt;br /&gt;(from Sasamori, 1893)]]

==Etymology==
Sudō (1944) hypothesized that the etymology of ''kaidā'' was {{nihongo|''kariya''|仮屋}}, which meant "government office" in Satsuma Domain. This term was borrowed by Ryūkyū on Okinawa and also by the bureaucrats of Yaeyama (''karja:'' in Modern Ishigaki). Standard Japanese /j/ regularly corresponds to /d/ in [[Yonaguni language|Yonaguni]], and /r/ is often dropped when surrounded by vowels. This theory is in line with the primary impetus for Kaidā glyphs, taxation.&lt;ref name="sudo1944"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sudō Toshiichi 須藤利一 |title=Nantō oboegaki 南島覺書 |year=1982 |orig-year=1944 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Immediately after conquering Ryūkyū, Satsuma conducted a land survey in Okinawa in 1609 and in Yaeyama in 1611. By doing so, Satsuma decided the amount of tribute to be paid annually by Ryūkyū. Following that, Ryūkyū imposed a poll tax on Yaeyama in 1640. A fixed quota was allocated to each island and then was broken up into each community. Finally, quotas were set for the individual islanders, adjusted only by age and gender. Community leaders were notified of quotas in the government office on Ishigaki. They checked the calculation using ''[[warazan]]'' (''barazan'' in Yaeyama), a straw-based method of calculation and recording numerals that was reminiscent of [[Inca Empire|Incan]] [[Quipu]]. After that, the quota for each household was written on a wooden plate called {{nihongo|''itafuda'' or ''hansatsu''|板札}}. That was where Kaidā glyphs were used. Although ''sōrō''-style Written Japanese had the status of administrative language, the remote islands had to rely on pictograms to notify illiterate peasants. According to a 19th-century document cited by the ''Yaeyama rekishi'' (1954), an official named Ōhama Seiki designed "perfect ideographs" for ''itafuda'' in the early 19th century although it suggests the existence of earlier, "imperfect" ideographs.&lt;ref name="yaeyamarekishi"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Yaeyama rekishi henshū iinkai 八重山歴史編集委員会 |title=Yaeyama rekishi 八重山歴史 |year=1954 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudō (1944) recorded an oral history on Yonaguni: 9 generations ago, an ancestor of the Kedagusuku lineage named Mase taught Kaidā glyphs and ''warazan'' to the public. Sudō dated the event to the second half of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="sudo1944" /&gt;

According to Ikema (1959), Kaidā glyphs and ''warazan'' were evidently accurate enough to make corrections to official announcements. The poll tax was finally abolished in 1903. They were used until the introduction of the nationwide primary education system rapidly lowered the illiteracy rate during the [[Meiji period]].&lt;ref name="ikema1959"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ikema Eizō 池間栄三 |title=Yonaguni no rekishi 与那国の歴史 |year=1959 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are currently used on Yonaguni and Taketomi for folk art, T-shirts, and other products, more for their artistic value than as a record-keeping system.

==Repertoire==
Kaidā glyphs consist of
*basic goods such as rice, millet, bean, bull, sheep, goat, fish and textile, and
*numerals, or basic units such as a bag of rice (俵), a bag of millet, a dipper of rice (斗), a box of rice (升), half a bag of rice, and
*household symbols called ''dāhan''.
As for numerals, similar systems called ''sūchūma'' can be found in [[Okinawa Islands|Okinawa]] and [[Miyako Islands|Miyako]] and appear to have their roots in the [[Suzhou numerals]].&lt;ref name="hagio2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hagio Toshiaki 萩尾俊章 |chapter=''Yonaguni no kaidā-ji o meguru ichi kōsatsu'' 与那国島のカイダー字をめぐる一考察 (A consideration for the "Kaidaa-Ji" (Kaidaa character) in Yonaguni Island) |editor=Okinawa kenritsu hakubutsukan bijutsukan 沖縄県立博物館・美術館 (Okinawa Prefectural Museum and Art Museum) | title=Yonaguni-jima sōgō chōsa hōkokusho 与那国島総合調査報告書 (Survey Reports on Natural History, History and Culture of Yonagunijima Island) |pages=49–64 |year=2009 |language=Japanese |url=http://www.museums.pref.okinawa.jp/museum/issue/report/image/yonaguni/yonaguni7.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research history==
The first non-Yaeyama author to comment on kaidā glyphs was [[Gisuke Sasamori]], who left copies of many short kaidā texts in his ''Nantō Tanken'' (南島探検, ''Exploration of the Southern Islands''), a record of his 1893 visit to [[Okinawa Prefecture]] which also mentions the hard labor imposed on the islanders by the regime. [[Yasusada Tashiro]] collected various numeral systems found in Okinawa and Miyako and donated them to the [[Tokyo National Museum]] in 1887. A paper on ''sūchūma'' by British Japanologist [[Basil Hall Chamberlain|Basil Chamberlain]] (1898)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| year = 1898
| title = A Quinary System of Notation employed in Luchu on the Wooden Tallies termed Shō-Chū-Ma.
| journal = The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland
| volume = 27
| pages = 383–395
| author = [[Basil Hall Chamberlain]]
| location = London
}}&lt;/ref&gt; appears to have been based on Tashiro's collection.&lt;ref name="hagio2009" /&gt;

In 1915 the mathematics teacher Kiichi Yamuro (矢袋喜一) included many more examples of kaidā glyphs, ''barazan'' knotted counting ropes, and local number words (along with a reproduction of Sasamori's records) in his book on Old Ryukyuan Mathematics (琉球古来の数学). Although Yamuro did not visit Yonaguni by himself, his records suggest that kaidā glyphs were still in daily use in the 1880s. Anthropologist [[Tadao Kawamura]], who made his anthropological study of the islands in the 1930s, noted "they were in use until recently." He showed how kaidā glyphs were used in sending packages.&lt;ref name="kawamura1939"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kawamura Tadao 河村只雄 |title=Nanpō bunka no tankyū 南方文化の探求 |year=1999 |orig-year=1939 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudō (1944) showed how business transactions were recorded on leaves using kaidā glyphs. He also proposed an etymology for kaidā.&lt;ref name="sudo1944" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2275">A '''Killing horizon''' is a [[null hypersurface]] defined by the vanishing of the norm of a [[Killing vector]] field (both are named after [[Wilhelm Killing]]). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=black holes|url=http://www.aei.mpg.de/~gielen/black.pdf|publisher=|first=Harvey|last=Reall|page=17|accessdate=2015-07-15|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Minkowski space-time]], in pseudo-Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt; (t,x,y,z) &lt;/math&gt; with signature &lt;math&gt; (+,-,-,-),&lt;/math&gt; an example of Killing horizon is provided by the [[Lorentz boost]] (a Killing vector of the space-time)

: &lt;math&gt; V = x \, \partial_t + t \, \partial_x. &lt;/math&gt;  

The square of the norm of &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; is 

: &lt;math&gt; g(V,V)=x^2-t^2=(x+t)(x-t). &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; is null only on the hyperplanes of equations

: &lt;math&gt; x+t=0, \text{ and } x-t=0, &lt;/math&gt; 

that, taken together, are the Killing horizons generated by &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Black-holes, an introduction| author= |first=P.T. |last= Chruściel|}} In {{cite book|title= "100 years of relativity", edited by A. Ashtekar, World Scientific, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Associated to a Killing horizon is a geometrical quantity known as [[surface gravity]], &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;.  If the surface gravity vanishes, then the Killing horizon is said to be degenerate.

== Black hole Killing horizons ==
Exact black hole metrics such as the [[Kerr–Newman metric]] contain Killing horizons which coincide with their [[ergosphere]]s.  For this spacetime, the Killing horizon is located at

: &lt;math&gt;r = r_e := M + \sqrt{M^2 - Q^2 - a^2 \cos^2 \theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the usual coordinates, outside the Killing horizon, the [[Killing vector]] field &lt;math&gt;\partial / \partial t&lt;/math&gt; is timelike, whilst inside it is spacelike.  The temperature of [[Hawking radiation]] is related to the [[surface gravity]] &lt;math&gt;c^2\kappa&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;T_H = \frac{\hbar c\kappa}{2 \pi k_B}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; the Boltzmann constant.

== Cosmological Killing horizons ==
[[De Sitter space]] has a Killing horizon at &lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt{3 / \Lambda}&lt;/math&gt; which emits thermal radiation at temperature &lt;math&gt;T = (1 / 2 \pi) \sqrt{\Lambda / 3}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Mconvexe.png|thumb|A set in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} satisfying the hypotheses of Minkowski's theorem.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''Minkowski's theorem''' is the statement that any [[convex set]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; which is symmetric with respect to the origin and which has [[volume]] greater than &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; contains a non-zero [[integer point]]. The theorem was proved by [[Hermann Minkowski]] in 1889 and became the foundation of the branch of [[number theory]] called the [[geometry of numbers]]. It can be extended from the integers to any [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and to any symmetric convex set with volume greater than &lt;math&gt;2^n\,d(L)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d(L)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the covolume of the lattice (the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of any of its bases).

==Formulation==
Suppose that {{math|''L''}} is a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] of [[Lattice (group)#Dividing_space_according_to_a_lattice|determinant]] {{math|d(''L'')}} in the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional real [[vector space]] {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''S''}} is a [[convex set|convex subset]] of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} that is symmetric with respect to the origin, meaning that if {{math|''x''}} is in {{math|''S''}} then {{math|−''x''}} is also in {{math|''S''}}. Minkowski's theorem states that if the volume of {{math|''S''}} is strictly greater than {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; d(''L'')}}, then {{math|''S''}} must contain at least one lattice point other than the origin. (Since the set {{math|''S''}} is symmetric, it would then contain at least three lattice points: the origin 0 and a pair of points {{math|±''x''}}, where {{math|''x'' ∈ ''L'' \ 0}}.)

==Example==
The simplest example of a lattice is the [[integer lattice]] {{math|ℤ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} of all points with [[integer]] coefficients; its determinant is 1. For {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}, the theorem claims that a convex figure in the [[Euclidean plane]] symmetric about the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] and with [[area]] greater than 4 encloses at least one lattice point in addition to the origin. The area bound is [[Mathematical jargon#sharp|sharp]]: if {{math|''S''}} is the interior of the square with vertices {{math|(±1, ±1)}} then {{math|''S''}} is symmetric and convex, and has area 4, but the only lattice point it contains is the origin. This example, showing that the bound of the theorem is sharp, generalizes to [[hypercube]]s in every dimension {{math|''n''}}.

==Proof==
The following argument proves Minkowski's theorem for the specific case of {{math|''L'' {{=}} ℤ&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. It can be generalized to arbitrary lattices in arbitrary dimensions.

Consider the map
:&lt;math&gt;f: S \to \mathbb{R}^2/2L, \qquad (x,y) \mapsto (x \bmod 2, y \bmod 2)&lt;/math&gt;
Intuitively, this map cuts the plane into 2 by 2 squares, then stacks the squares on top of each other. Clearly {{math|''f''(''S'')}} has area less than or equal to 4, because this set lies within a 2 by 2 square. Assume for a contradiction that {{math|''f''}} could be [[injective]], which means the pieces of {{math|''S''}} cut out by the squares stack up in a non-overlapping way. Because {{math|''f''}} is locally area-preserving, this non-overlapping property would make it area-preserving for all of {{math|''S''}}, so the area of {{math|''f''(''S'')}} would be the same as that of {{math|''S''}}, which is greater than 4. That is not the case, so the assumption must be false: {{math|''f''}} is not injective, meaning that there exist at least two distinct points {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{math|''S''}} that are mapped by {{math|''f''}} to the same point: {{math|''f''(''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''f''(''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

Because of the way {{math|''f''}} was defined,
the only way that {{math|''f''(''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} can equal {{math|''f''(''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is for {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
to equal {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + (2''i'', 2''j'')}} for some integers {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}}, not both zero.
That is, the coordinates of the two points differ by two even integers. 
Since {{math|''S''}} is symmetric about the origin, {{math|−''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is also a point in {{math|''S''}}. Since {{math|''S''}} is convex, the line segment between {{math|−''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} lies entirely in {{math|''S''}}, and in particular the midpoint of that segment lies in {{math|''S''}}. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}\left(-p_1 + p_2\right) = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(-p_1 + p_1 + (2i, 2j)\right) = (i, j)&lt;/math&gt;
is a point in {{math|''S''}}. But this point {{math|(''i'',''j'')}} is an integer point, and is not the origin since {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}} are not both zero.
Therefore, {{math|''S''}} contains a nonzero integer point.

==Applications==
An application of this theorem is the result that every class in the [[ideal class group]] of a [[number field]] {{math|''K''}} contains an [[integral ideal]] of [[field norm|norm]] not exceeding a certain bound, depending on {{math|''K''}}, called [[Minkowski's bound]]: the finiteness of the [[Class number (number theory)|class number]] of an algebraic number field follows immediately.

Minkowski's theorem is also useful to prove [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]], which states that every natural number can be written as the sum of the squares of four natural numbers.

'''Mondex''' is a [[smart card]] [[electronic cash]] system, implemented as a [[stored-value card]].

Mondex was conceived by Tim Jones and Graham Higgins of the [[NatWest|National Westminster Bank]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The system was initially developed between 1990 and 1993, with internal trials being carried out by approximately 6,000 London-based NatWest staff from 1992. The system was publicly unveiled in December 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wings.buffalo.edu/academic/department/som/isinterface/is_syllabus/mondex/mondex.html |title=Mondex International:  Reengineering MoneyII |access-date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial public trials of the payment system were carried out from July 1995, by the newly incorporated Mondex International in [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]]. The public phase had required the development and manufacture of numerous merchant devices and smart cards, with [[BT Group|BT]], NatWest and the [[Midland Bank]] sponsoring and installing retail terminals at the car parks, payphones, buses and 700 of the merchants in the town, and issuing Mondex cards to the residents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9133">In mathematics, '''Moufang polygons'''  are a generalization by [[Jacques Tits]] of the [[Moufang plane]]s studied by [[Ruth Moufang]], and are irreducible [[building (mathematics)|building]]s of rank two that admit the action of [[root group]]s.
In a book on the topic, Tits and Richard Weiss&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jacques |last1=Tits |authorlink1=Jacques Tits|first2=Richard |last2=Weiss |title=Moufang Polygons |location= |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2002 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; classify them all. An earlier theorem, proved independently by Tits and Weiss,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jacques |last1=Tits |authorlink1=Jacques Tits |title=Non-existence de certains, polygones généralisés, I, II |journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |year=1976 |pages=275–284 |doi=10.1007/BF01390013 }} '''51''' (3), (1979) 267–269 {{doi|10.1007/BF01389919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Weiss |title=The nonexistence of certain Moufang polygons |journal=Inventiones Mathematicae |volume=51 |issue=3 |year=1979 |pages=261–266 |doi=10.1007/BF01389918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a Moufang polygon must be a generalized 3-gon, 4-gon, 6-gon, or 8-gon, so the purpose of the aforementioned book was to analyze these four cases.

==Definitions==

*A generalized ''n''-gon is a bipartite graph of diameter ''n'' and girth 2''n''.
*A graph is called thick if all vertices have valence at least 3.
*A root of a generalized ''n''-gon is a path of length ''n''.
*An apartment of a generalized ''n''-gon is a cycle of length 2''n''.
*The root subgroup of a root is the subgroup of automorphisms of a graph that fix all vertices adjacent to one of the inner vertices of the root.
*A Moufang ''n''-gon is a thick generalized ''n''-gon (with ''n''&gt;2) such that the root subgroup of any root acts transitively on the apartments containing the root.

== Moufang 3-gons ==
A Moufang 3-gon can be identified with the [[incidence graph]] of a Moufang [[projective plane]]. In this identification, the points and lines of the plane correspond to the vertices of the building.
Real forms of [[Lie groups]] give rise to examples which are the three main types of Moufang 3-gons. There are four real [[division algebras]]: the real numbers, the [[complex numbers]], the [[quaternions]], and the [[octonions]], of dimensions 1,2,4 and 8, respectively. The projective plane over such a division algebra then gives rise to a Moufang 3-gon.

These projective planes correspond to the building attached to SL&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), SL&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''C'''), a real form of A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and to a real form of E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

In the first diagram{{clarify|post-text=what diagram?|date=August 2012}} the circled nodes represent 1-spaces and 2-spaces in a three-dimensional vector space. In the second diagram{{clarify|post-text=what diagram?|date=August 2012}} the circled nodes represent 1-space and 2-spaces in a 3-dimensional vector space over the [[quaternions]], which in turn represent certain 2-spaces and 4-spaces in a 6-dimensional complex vector space, as expressed by the circled nodes in the A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; diagram. 
The fourth case — a form of E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; — is exceptional, and its analogue for Moufang 4-gons is a major feature of Weiss’s book.

Going from the real numbers to an arbitrary field, Moufang 3-gons can be divided into three cases as above. The split case in the first diagram exists over any field. The second case extends to all associative, non-commutative division algebras; over the reals these are limited to the algebra of quaternions, which has degree 2 (and dimension 4), but some fields admit central division algebras of other degrees. 
The third case involves ‘alternative’ division algebras (which satisfy a weakened form of the associative law), and a theorem of [[Richard Bruck]] and Erwin Kleinfeld&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard H. |last=Bruck |author1-link=Richard Bruck|first2=Erwin |last2=Kleinfeld |title=The structure of alternative division rings |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=2 |issue=6 |year=1951 |pages=878–890 |doi= 10.2307/2031702 |jstor=2031702|mr=0045099 |pmc=1063309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that these are Cayley-Dickson algebras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Erwin |last=Kleinfeld |title=Alternative division rings of characteristic 2 |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=37 |issue=12 |year=1951 |pages=818–820 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.37.12.818|pmc=1063478|mr=0041834 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concludes the discussion of Moufang 3-gons.

== Moufang 4-gons ==
Moufang 4-gons are also called Moufang quadrangles.
The classification of Moufang 4-gons was the hardest of all, and when Tits and Weiss started to write it up, a hitherto unnoticed type came into being, arising from groups of type F4. They can be divided into three classes:

*  (i) Those arising from classical groups.
* (ii) Those arising from “mixed groups” (in which there are two imperfect fields of characteristic 2, K and L, with K2 ⊂ L ⊂ K).
* (iii) Those arising from quadrangular algebras.

There is some overlap here, in the sense that some classical groups arising from pseudo-quadratic spaces can be obtained from quadrangular algebras (which Weiss calls special), but there are other, non-special ones. The most important of these arise from algebraic groups of types E6, E7, and E8. They are k-forms of algebraic groups belonging to the following diagrams:
E6
E7
E8. 
The E6 one exists over the real numbers, though the E7 and E8 ones do not. Weiss calls the quadrangular algebras in all these cases Weiss regular, but not special. 
There is a further type that he calls defective arising from groups of type F4. These are the most exotic of all—they involve purely inseparable field extensions in characteristic 2—and Weiss only discovered them during the joint work with Tits on the classification of Moufang 4-gons by investigating a strange lacuna that should not have existed but did.

The classification of Moufang 4-gons by Tits and Weiss is related to their intriguing monograph in two ways. One is that the use of quadrangular algebras short-cuts some of the methods known before. The other is that the concept is an analogue to the octonion algebras, and quadratic Jordan division algebras of degree 3, that give rise to Moufang 3-gons and 6-gons.

In fact all the exceptional Moufang planes, quadrangles, and hexagons that do not arise from "mixed groups" (of characteristic 2 for quadrangles or characteristic 3 for hexagons) come from octonions, quadrangular algebras, or Jordan algebras.

== Moufang 6-gons ==
Moufang 6-gons are also called Moufang hexagons. A classification of Moufang 6-gons was stated by Tits,&lt;ref&gt;J. Tits, Classification of buildings of spherical type and Moufang polygons: a survey, in
Coll. Internaz. Teorie Combinatorie, Atti dei Convegni Lincei 17, Rome 1976, pp. 229–246.&lt;/ref&gt; though the details remained unproven until the joint work with Weiss on Moufang Polygons.

== Moufang 8-gons ==
Moufang 8-gons are also called Moufang octagons. They were classified by Tits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Tits |title=Moufang octagons and Ree groups of type &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=[[American Journal of Mathematics|Amer. J. Math.]] |volume=105 |issue=2 |year=1983 |pages=539–594 |jstor=2374268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he showed that they all arise from [[Ree groups]] of type ²F₄.

==Quadrangular algebras==
A potential use for quadrangular algebras is to analyze two open questions. One is the Kneser-Tits conjecture&lt;ref&gt;J. Tits, Groupes de Whitehead de groupes algébriques simples sur un corps, Séminaire Bourbaki, 1976–77, no. 505; Lecture Notes in Mathematics 677, Springer-Verlag, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; that concerns the full group of '''linear transformations''' of a building (e.g. GL&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) factored out by the subgroup generated by root groups (e.g. SL&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

The conjecture is proved for all Moufang buildings except the 6-gons and 4-gons of type E8, in which case the group of linear transformations is conjectured to be equal to the subgroup generated by root groups. For the E8 hexagons this can be rephrased as a question on quadratic Jordan algebras, and for the E8 quadrangles it can now be rephrased in terms of quadrangular algebras.

Another open question about the E8 quadrangle concerns fields that are complete with respect to a discrete valuation: is there, in such cases, an affine building that yields the quadrangle as its structure at infinity?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">The '''nullity''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] in the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] subject of [[graph theory]] can mean either of two unrelated numbers.  If the graph has ''n'' vertices and ''m'' edges, then:

* In the [[matrix theory]] of graphs, the nullity of the graph is the nullity of the [[adjacency matrix]] ''A'' of the graph. The nullity of ''A'' is given by ''n'' &amp;minus; ''r'' where, ''r'' is the [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the adjacency matrix.  This nullity equals the multiplicity of the [[eigenvalue]] 0 in the spectrum of the adjacency matrix.  See Cvetkovič and Gutman (1972), Cheng and Liu (2007), and Gutman and Borovićanin (2011).
* In the [[matroid theory]] the nullity of the graph is the nullity of the oriented [[incidence matrix]] ''M'' associated with the graph. The nullity of ''M'' is given by ''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'' + ''c'', where, ''c'' is the number of components of the graph and ''n'' &amp;minus; ''c'' is the [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the oriented incidence matrix.  This name is rarely used; the number is more commonly known as the '''cycle rank''', '''cyclomatic number''', or '''[[circuit rank]]''' of the graph.  It is equal to the rank of the co[[graphic matroid]] of the graph.  It also equals the nullity of the [[Laplacian matrix]] of the graph, defined as ''L'' = ''D &amp;minus; A'', where ''D'' is the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees; the Laplacian nullity equals the cycle rank because ''L'' = ''M M&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'' (''M'' times its own transpose).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3336">In [[computational complexity theory]], the '''parallel computation thesis''' is a [[hypothesis]] which states that the ''time'' used by a (reasonable) parallel machine is polynomially related to the ''space'' used by a sequential machine.  The parallel computation thesis was set forth by [[Ashok K. Chandra|Chandra]] and [[Larry Stockmeyer|Stockmeyer]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=alternation&gt;{{Cite conference|last1=Chandra|first1=Ashok K.|last2=Stockmeyer|first2=Larry J.|title=Alternation|booktitle=FOCS'76: Proceedings of the 17th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|pages=98–108|doi=10.1109/SFCS.1976.4|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, for a [[computational model]] which allows computations to branch and run in parallel without bound, a [[formal language]] which is [[decidable language|decidable]] under the model using no more than &lt;math&gt;t(n)&lt;/math&gt; steps for inputs of length ''n'' is decidable by a non-branching machine using no more than &lt;math&gt;t(n)^k&lt;/math&gt; units of storage for some constant ''k''.  Similarly, if a machine in the unbranching model decides a language using no more than &lt;math&gt;s(n)&lt;/math&gt; storage, a machine in the parallel model can decide the language in no more than &lt;math&gt;s(n)^k&lt;/math&gt; steps for some constant ''k''.

The parallel computation thesis is not a rigorous formal statement, as it does not clearly define what constitutes an acceptable parallel model.  A parallel machine must be sufficiently powerful to emulate the sequential machine in time polynomially related to the sequential space; compare [[Turing machine]], [[non-deterministic Turing machine]], and [[alternating Turing machine]].  N. Blum (1983) introduced a model for which the thesis does not hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Information Processing Letters|last=Blum|first=Norbert|title=A note on the 'parallel computation thesis'|volume=17|issue=4|pages=203–205|year=1983|doi=10.1016/0020-0190(83)90041-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the model allows &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{O(T(n))}}&lt;/math&gt; parallel threads of computation after &lt;math&gt;T(n)&lt;/math&gt; steps.  (See [[Big O notation]].)  Parberry (1986) suggested a more "reasonable" bound would be &lt;math&gt;2^{O(T(n))}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2^{T(n)^{O(1)}}&lt;/math&gt;, in defense of the thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1145/8312.8317|last=Parberry|first=I.|title=Parallel speedup of sequential machines: a defense of parallel computation thesis|journal=ACM SIGACT News|volume=18|issue=1|pages=54–67|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Goldschlager (1982) proposed a model which is sufficiently universal to emulate all "reasonable" parallel models, which adheres to the thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1145/322344.322353|last=Goldschlager|first=Leslie M.|title=A universal interconnection pattern for parallel computers|journal=[[Journal of the ACM]]|volume=29|issue=3|pages=1073–1086|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chandra and Stockmeyer originally formalized and proved results related to the thesis for deterministic and alternating Turing machines, which is where the thesis originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1145/322234.322243|last1=Chandra|first1=Ashok K.|last2=Kozen|first2=Dexter C.|last3=Stockmeyer|first3=Larry J.|title=Alternation|journal=[[Journal of the ACM]]|volume=28|issue=1|pages=114–133|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''percent (per cent) sign''' ('''%''') is the symbol used to indicate a [[percentage]], a number or [[ratio]] as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] of 100. Related signs include the [[permille]] (per thousand) sign ‰ and the [[Basis point|permyriad]] (per ten thousand) sign ‱ (also known as a [[basis point]]), which indicate that a number is divided by one thousand or ten thousand respectively. Higher proportions use [[parts-per notation]].

== Correct style ==

English style guides prescribe writing the number and percent sign without any space between.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-p ''Guardian and Observer style guide.'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; in line with the general practice of using a [[non-breaking space]] between a [[numerical value]] and its corresponding [[unit of measurement]].

Other languages have other rules for spacing in front of the percent sign:
* In [[Czech language|Czech]] and in [[Slovak language|Slovak]], the percent sign is spaced with a non-breaking space if the number is used as a noun,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | year = 2014
  | url = http://prirucka.ujc.cas.cz/?id=880
  | accessdate = 2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas no space is inserted if the number is used as an adjective (e.g. “a 50% increase”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the percent sign is always spaced, and a [[Finnish noun cases|case suffix]] can be attached to it using the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] (e.g. ''50 %:n kasvu'' 'an increase of 50%').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* In [[French language|French]], the percent sign must be spaced with a non-breaking space.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}}

* In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the percent sign must always be spaced now, as almost every other symbol.
* In [[Russian language|Russian]], the percent sign is rarely spaced, contrary to the guidelines of the GOST 8.417-2002 state standard.
* In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the percent sign is almost never spaced, probably because Chinese does not use spaces to separate characters or words at all.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
* According to the [[Swedish Language Council]], the percent sign should be preceded by a space in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], as all other units.
* In [[German language|German]], the space is prescribed by the regulatory body in the national standard [[DIN 5008]].
* In [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and other [[Turkic languages]], the percent sign precedes rather than follows the number, without an intervening space.
* In [[Persian language|Persian]] texts, the percent sign may either precede or follow the number, in either case without a space.
* In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the percent sign follows the number; as Arabic is written from [[right to left]], this means that the percent sign is to the left of the number, usually without a space.
* In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the percent sign precedes the number without intervening space; as Hebrew is written from right to left, this means that the percent sign is written to the right of the number, just as in English.

=== Usage in text ===
It is often recommended that the percent sign only be used in tables and other places with space restrictions. In running text, it should be spelled out as ''percent'' or ''per cent'' (often in newspapers). For example, not ''"Sales increased by 24% over 2006"'', but rather ''"Sales increased by 24 percent over 2006"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/styleguide.html 	American Economic Review: Style Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225140441/http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/styleguide.html |date=2007-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmacy.unc.edu/news/communications-office/style-guide UNC Pharmacy style guide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/Publications/styleguide/numbers.html University of Colorado style guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==
Prior to 1425 there is no known evidence of a special symbol being used for percentage. The [[Italian language|Italian]] term ''per cento'', "for a hundred", was used as well as several different abbreviations (e.g. "per 100", "p 100", "p cento", etc.). Examples of this can be seen in the 1339 arithmetic text (author unknown) depicted below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1898|loc=p. 437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter p with its [[Descender|descender]] crossed by a horizontal or diagonal strike conventionally stood for per, por, par, or pur in Mediaeval and Renaissance palaeography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inkunabeln.ub.uni-koeln.de/vdibProduction/handapparat/nachs_w/cappelli/capp317.html Letter p.] / Cappelli, Adriano: [http://inkunabeln.ub.uni-koeln.de/vdibProduction/handapparat/nachs_w/cappelli/cappelli.html Lexicon Abbreviaturarum]. 2. verb. Aufl. Leipzig 1928. Wörterbuch der Abkürzungen: P. pages 256–257&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Percent sign in 1339.png|frame|center|alt=1339 arithmetic text|1339 arithmetic text in ''Rara Arithmetica'', p. 437]]

At some point a scribe of some sort used the abbreviation "pc" with a tiny loop or circle (depicting the ending ''-o'' used in Italian numeration for ''primo, secondo,'' etc.) This appears in some additional pages of a 1425 text which were probably added around 1435.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1898|loc=pp. 439-440}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is shown below (source, ''Rara Arithmetica'' p.&amp;nbsp;440).

[[File:Percent sign in 1425.png|frame|center|1425 arithmetic text in ''Rara Arithmetica'', p. 440]]

The "pc" with a loop eventually evolved into a horizontal fraction sign by 1650 (see below for an example in a 1684 text&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1898|loc=p. 441}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and thereafter lost the "per".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1898|loc=p. 440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Percent sign in 1648.png|frame|center|alt=1684 arithmetic text|1684 arithmetic text in ''Rara Arithmetica'', p. 441]]

In 1925 D.E. Smith  wrote, "The [[Solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] form ([[File:Percentsign in Poor Richard font.png|20px|Poor Richard font]]) is modern."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1925|loc=Vol. 2, p. 250}} in Dover reprint of 1958, {{ISBN|0-486-20430-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encodings ===

==== Unicode ====
The [[Unicode]] code points are:
* {{unichar
| 0025

| image =
| size  = 150%
| html  =
}} (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;percnt;&lt;/code&gt; in HTML5&lt;ref&gt;HTML5 is the only version of HTML that has a named entity for the percent sign, see https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html ("The following sections present the complete lists of character entity references.") and https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-html5-20140731/syntax.html#named-character-references ("percnt;").&lt;/ref&gt;),

}}
*{{unichar

| note=see [[Small Form Variants]]
}}

There is also {{unichar|066A|ARABIC PERCENT SIGN|html=}}, which has the circles replaced by square dots set on edge, the shape of the digit 0 in [[Arabic numerals]].

==== ASCII ====
The [[ASCII code]] for the percent [[character (computing)|character]] is 37, or 0x25 in [[hexadecimal]].

=== In computers ===
Names for the percent sign include percent sign (in [[ITU-T]]), [[Modulo operation|mod]], grapes (in [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] [[jargon]]), and the humorous double-oh-seven (in [[INTERCAL]]).

In [[computing]], the percent [[character (computing)|character]] is also used for the [[modulo operation]] in [[programming language]]s that derive their syntax from the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], which in turn acquired this usage from the earlier [[B (programming language)|B]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/kbman.html |title=Users' Reference to B |first=Ken |last=Thompson |year=1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706005453/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/kbman.html |archivedate=2006-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the textual representation of [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]], a % immediately followed by a 2-digit [[hexadecimal]] number denotes an octet specifying (part of) a character that might otherwise not be allowed in URIs (see [[percent-encoding]]).

In [[SQL]], the percent sign is a [[wildcard character]] in "LIKE" expressions, for example &lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM table WHERE fullname LIKE 'Lisa %'&lt;/code&gt; will fetch all records whose names start with "&lt;tt&gt;Lisa &lt;/tt&gt;".

In [[TeX]] (and therefore also in LaTeX) and [[PostScript]], and in [[GNU Octave]] and [[MATLAB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://octave.org/doc/interpreter/Single-Line-Comments.html#Single-Line-Comments|publisher=GNU|title=2.7.1 Single Line Comments}}&lt;/ref&gt; a % denotes a line [[comment (computing)|comment]].

In [[BASIC]], a trailing % after a variable name marks it as an [[integer]].

In [[Perl]] % is the [[Sigil (computer programming)|sigil]] for [[Hash table|hashes]].

In many programming languages' string formatting operations (performed by functions such as [[printf]]), the percent sign denotes parts of the template string that will be replaced with arguments. (See [[printf format string]].) In [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] the percent sign is also used as the string formatting operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting|title=Python 2 – String Formatting Operations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting|title=Python 3 – printf-style String Formatting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html#method-i-25|title=Ruby – String#%}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[command processor]]s [[COMMAND.COM]] (DOS) and [[CMD.EXE]] (OS/2 and Windows), %1, %2,... stand for the first, second,... parameters of a [[batch file]].  %0 stands for the specification of the batch file itself as typed on the command line.  The % sign is also used similarly in the FOR command.
%VAR1% represents the value of an [[environment variable]] named VAR1. Thus:
 set PATH=c:\;%PATH%
sets a new value for PATH, that being the old value preceded by "&lt;tt&gt;c:\;&lt;/tt&gt;".
Because these uses give the percent sign special meaning, the sequence %% (two percent signs) is used to represent a literal percent sign, so that:
 set PATH=c:\;%%PATH%%
would set PATH to the literal value "&lt;tt&gt;c:\;%PATH%&lt;/tt&gt;".

In the [[C Shell]], % is part of the default [[Prompt (computing)|command prompt]].

=== In linguistics ===
In linguistics, the percent sign is prepended to an example [[String (computer science)|string]] to show that it is judged [[well-formed formula|well-formed]] by some speakers and ill-formed by others. This may be due to differences in [[dialect]] or even individual [[idiolect]]s. This is similar to the [[asterisk]] to mark ill-formed strings, the [[question mark]] to mark strings where well-formedness is unclear, and the [[number sign]] to mark strings that are syntactically well-formed but semantically nonsensical.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5066">In [[mathematics]], in particular in [[algebra]], '''polarization''' is a technique for expressing a [[homogeneous polynomial]] in a simpler fashion by adjoining more variables.  Specifically, given a homogeneous polynomial, polarization produces a [[multilinear form]] from which the original polynomial can be recovered by evaluating along a certain diagonal.

Although the technique is deceptively simple, it has applications in many areas of abstract mathematics: in particular to [[algebraic geometry]], [[invariant theory]], and [[representation theory]].  Polarization and related techniques form the foundations for [[Weyl's invariant theory]].

==The technique==
The fundamental ideas are as follows.  Let ''f''('''u''') be a polynomial in ''n'' variables '''u''' = (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;).  Suppose that ''f'' is homogeneous of degree ''d'', which means that
:''f''(''t'' '''u''') = ''t''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; ''f''('''u''')   for all ''t''.

Let '''u'''&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, '''u'''&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., '''u'''&lt;sup&gt;(d)&lt;/sup&gt; be a collection of [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]]s with '''u'''&lt;sup&gt;(i)&lt;/sup&gt; = (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(i)&lt;/sup&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(i)&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''u''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(i)&lt;/sup&gt;), so that there are ''dn'' variables altogether.  The '''polar form''' of ''f'' is a polynomial
:''F''('''u'''&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, '''u'''&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., '''u'''&lt;sup&gt;(d)&lt;/sup&gt;)
which is linear separately in each '''u'''&lt;sup&gt;(i)&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., ''F'' is multilinear), symmetric in the '''u'''&lt;sup&gt;(i)&lt;/sup&gt;, and such that
:''F''('''u''','''u''', ..., '''u''')=''f''('''u''').

The polar form of ''f'' is given by the following construction
:&lt;math&gt;F({\mathbf u}^{(1)},\dots,{\mathbf u}^{(d)})=\frac{1}{d!}\frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda_1}\dots\frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda_d}f(\lambda_1{\mathbf u}^{(1)}+\dots+\lambda_d{\mathbf u}^{(d)})|_{\lambda=0}.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, ''F'' is a constant multiple of the coefficient of λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...λ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; in the expansion of ''f''(λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''u'''&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + λ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'''u'''&lt;sup&gt;(d)&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Examples==
*Suppose that '''x'''=(''x'',''y'') and ''f''('''x''') is the [[quadratic form]]
:&lt;math&gt;f({\mathbf x}) = x^2 + 3 x y + 2 y^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the polarization of ''f'' is a function in '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; = (''x''&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;) and '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt; = (''x''&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;) given by
:&lt;math&gt;F({\mathbf x}^{(1)},{\mathbf x}^{(2)}) = x^{(1)}x^{(2)}+\frac{3}{2}x^{(2)}y^{(1)}+\frac{3}{2}x^{(1)}y^{(2)}+2 y^{(1)}y^{(2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

*More generally, if ''f'' is any quadratic form, then the polarization of ''f'' agrees with the conclusion of the [[polarization identity]].
*'''A cubic example.'''  Let ''f''(''x'',''y'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''xy''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then the polarization of ''f'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;F(x^{(1)},y^{(1)},x^{(2)},y^{(2)},x^{(3)},y^{(3)})= x^{(1)}x^{(2)}x^{(3)}+\frac{2}{3}x^{(1)}y^{(2)}y^{(3)}+\frac{2}{3}x^{(3)}y^{(1)}y^{(2)}+\frac{2}{3}x^{(2)}y^{(3)}y^{(1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Mathematical details and consequences==
The polarization of a homogeneous polynomial of degree ''d'' is valid over any [[commutative ring]] in which ''d''! is a unit.  In particular, it holds over any [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic zero]] or whose characteristic is strictly greater than ''d''.

===The polarization isomorphism (by degree)===
For simplicity, let ''k'' be a field of characteristic zero and let {{nowrap|1=''A'' = ''k''['''x''']}} be the [[polynomial ring]] in ''n'' variables over ''k''.  Then ''A'' is [[graded ring|graded]] by [[degree of a polynomial|degree]], so that
:&lt;math&gt;A = \bigoplus_d A_d.&lt;/math&gt;
The polarization of algebraic forms then induces an isomorphism of vector spaces in each degree
:&lt;math&gt;A_d \cong Sym^d k^n&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Sym''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''d''-th [[symmetric power]] of the ''n''-dimensional space ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

These isomorphisms can be expressed independently of a basis as follows.  If ''V'' is a finite-dimensional vector space and ''A'' is the ring of ''k''-valued polynomial functions on ''V'', graded by homogeneous degree, then polarization yields an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;A_d \cong Sym^d V^*.&lt;/math&gt;

===The algebraic isomorphism===
Furthermore, the polarization is compatible with the algebraic structure on ''A'', so that
:&lt;math&gt;A \cong Sym^\cdot V^*&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Sym''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;sdot;&lt;/sup&gt;''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is the full [[symmetric algebra]] over ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Remarks===
* For fields of [[positive characteristic]] ''p'', the foregoing isomorphisms apply if the graded algebras are truncated at degree ''p''-1.
* There do exist generalizations when ''V'' is an infinite dimensional [[topological vector space]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2312">In [[mathematics]], a '''quadratic algebra''' is a [[filtered algebra]] generated by degree one elements, with defining relations of degree 2. It was pointed out by [[Yuri Manin]] that such algebras play an important role in the theory of [[quantum group]]s. The most important class of graded quadratic algebras is [[Koszul algebra]]s.

== Definition ==

A '''graded quadratic algebra''' ''A'' is determined by a [[vector space]] of generators ''V'' = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a subspace of homogeneous quadratic relations ''S'' ⊂ ''V'' ⊗ ''V'' {{harv| Polishchuk | Positselski | 2005 | p=6 }}. Thus

: &lt;math&gt; A=T(V)/\langle S\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

and inherits its grading from the [[tensor algebra]] ''T''(''V''). 

If the subspace of relations is instead allowed to  also contain inhomogeneous degree 2 elements,  i.e. ''S'' ⊂ ''k'' ⊕ ''V'' ⊕ (''V'' ⊗ ''V''), this construction results in a '''filtered quadratic algebra'''.

A graded quadratic algebra ''A'' as above admits a '''quadratic dual''': the quadratic algebra generated by ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and with quadratic relations forming the orthogonal complement of ''S'' in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ⊗ ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Examples ==

* [[Tensor algebra]], [[symmetric algebra]] and [[exterior algebra]] of a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] are graded quadratic (in fact, Koszul) algebras.
* [[Universal enveloping algebra]] of a finite-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] is a filtered quadratic algebra.

'''Quantum information science''' is an area of study based on the idea that information science depends on quantum effects in physics.  It includes theoretical issues in computational models as well as more experimental topics in quantum physics including what can and cannot be done with [[quantum information]]. The term '''quantum information theory''' is sometimes used, but it fails to encompass experimental research in the area and can be confused with a subfield of quantum information science that studies the processing of quantum information.

Subfields include:
* [[Quantum computing]], which deals on the one hand with the question how and whether one can build a [[quantum computer]] and on the other hand, [[algorithms]] that harness its power (see [[quantum algorithm]])
* [[Quantum error correction]]
* [[Quantum information theory]]
* [[Quantum complexity theory]]
* [[Quantum cryptography]] and its generalization, quantum communication
* [[Quantum communication complexity]]
* [[Quantum entanglement]], as seen from an information-theoretic point of view
* [[Quantum dense coding]]
* [[Quantum teleportation]] is a well-known quantum information processing operation, which can be used to move any arbitrary quantum state from one particle (at one location) to another.

In [[geometry]], the '''rhombitetraheptagonal tiling''' is a uniform tiling of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]. It has [[Schläfli symbol]] of rr{4,7}. It can be seen as constructed as a [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] [[tetraheptagonal tiling]], r{7,4}, as well as an [[Expansion (geometry)|expanded]] [[order-4 heptagonal tiling]] or expanded [[order-7 square tiling]].

== Dual tiling ==
The dual is called the ''deltoidal tetraheptagonal tiling'' with [[face configuration]] V.4.4.4.7.

A '''secant plane''' is a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] containing a nontrivial [[Cross section (geometry)|section]] of a [[sphere]] or an [[ellipsoid]], or such a plane that a sphere is projected onto. Secant planes are similar to tangent planes, which contact the sphere's surface at a point, while secant planes contact the surface along curves.

The two-dimensional representations of secant planes are [[secant line]]s, the lines that join two distinct points on a curve.

== Applications ==
Secant planes are used in [[map projection]]s. The secant plane intersects a globe along a small circle with no distortion, forming a [[Standard parallel (map projections)|standard parallel]] which has true scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geokov.com/education/map-projection.aspx|title=Map projection - types and distortion|last=|first=|website=geokov.com|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seismic tomography''' is a technique for imaging the subsurface of the Earth with seismic waves produced by earthquakes or explosions. [[P-wave|P-]], [[S-wave|S-]], and surface waves can be used for tomographic models of different resolutions based on seismic wavelength, wave source distance, and the seismograph array coverage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-3899-1_1|title=Seismic wave propagation and seismic tomography|last=Nolet|first=G.|date=1987-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789027725837|editor-last=Nolet|editor-first=Guust|series=Seismology and Exploration Geophysics|pages=1–23|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-009-3899-1_1#page-1|doi-broken-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data received at seismometers are used to solve an inverse problem, wherein the locations of reflection and refraction of the wave paths are determined. This solution can be used to create 3D images of velocity anomalies which may be interpreted as structural, thermal, or compositional variations. [[Earth science|Geoscientists]] use these images to better understand core, mantle, and [[Plate tectonics|plate tectonic]] processes.

==Theory==
Tomography is solved as an [[inverse problem]]. Seismic travel time data are compared to an initial Earth model and the model is modified until the best possible fit between the model predictions and observed data is found. Seismic waves would travel in straight lines if Earth was of uniform composition, but the compositional layering, tectonic structure, and thermal variations reflect and refract [[seismic wave]]s. The location and magnitude of these variations can be calculated by the inversion process, although solutions to tomographic inversions are non-unique.

Seismic tomography is similar to medical x-ray [[Computed Tomography|computed tomography]] (CT scan) in that a computer processes receiver data to produce a 3D image, although CT scans use attenuation instead of traveltime difference. Seismic tomography has to deal with the analysis of curved ray paths which are reflected and refracted within the earth and potential uncertainty in the location of the earthquake [[hypocenter]]. CT scans use linear x-rays and a known source.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iris.edu/hq/inclass/downloads/optional/269|title=Seismic Tomography—Using earthquakes to image Earth's interior|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS)|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Seismic tomography requires large datasets of [[seismogram]]s and well-located earthquake or explosion sources. These became more widely available in the 1960s with the expansion of global seismic networks and in the 1970s when digital seismograph data archives were established. These developments occurred concurrently with advancements in computing power that were required to solve inverse problems and generate theoretical seismograms for model testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/about/workshops/thailand/downloads/CSMpp1_History.pdf|title=A Brief History of Seismology|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United States Geologic Survey (USGS)|access-date=4 May 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803190244/https://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/about/workshops/thailand/downloads/CSMpp1_History.pdf|archivedate=3 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
Seismic tomography uses seismic records to create 2D and 3D images of subsurface anomalies by solving large inverse problems such that generate models consistent with observed data. Various methods are used to resolve anomalies in the crust and lithosphere, shallow mantle, whole mantle, and core based on the availability of data and types of seismic waves that penetrate the region at a suitable wavelength for feature resolution. The accuracy of the model is limited by availability and accuracy of seismic data, wave type utilized, and assumptions made in the model.

P-wave data are used in most local models and global models in areas with sufficient earthquake and seismograph density. S- and surface wave data are used in global models when this coverage is not sufficient, such as in ocean basins and away from subduction zones. First-arrival times are the most widely used, but models utilizing [[Seismic wave#Notation|reflected and refracted phases]] are used in more complex models, such as those imaging the core. Differential traveltimes between wave phases or types are also used.

=== Local tomography ===
Local tomographic models are often based on  a temporary seismic array targeting specific areas, unless in a seismically active region with extensive permanent network coverage. These allow for the imaging of the crust and upper mantle. 
* ''Diffraction and wave equation tomography'' use the full waveform, rather than just the first arrival times. The inversion of amplitude and phases of all arrivals provide more detailed density information than transmission traveltime alone. Despite the theoretical appeal, these methods are not widely employed because of the computing expense and difficult inversions.
* ''Reflection tomography'' originated with [[exploration geophysics]]. It uses an artificial source to resolve small-scale features at crustal depths. ''Wide-angle tomography'' is similar, but with a wide source to receiver offset. This allows for the detection of seismic waves refracted from sub-crustal depths and can determine continental architecture and details of plate margins. These two methods are often used together.
* ''Local earthquake tomography'' is used in seismically active regions with sufficient seismometer coverage. Given the proximity between source and receivers, a precise earthquake focus location must be known. This requires the simultaneous iteration of both structure and focus locations in model calculations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* ''Teleseismic tomography'' uses waves from distant earthquakes that deflect upwards to a local seismic array. The models can reach depths similar to the array aperture, typically to depths for imaging the crust and lithosphere (a few hundred kilometers). The waves travel near 30° from vertical, creating a vertical distortion to compact features.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebpagePDFs/Seismology.pdf|title=Seismology: The Hunt for Plumes|last=Julian|first=Bruce|date=2006|website=|publisher=mantleplumes.org|access-date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional or global tomography ===
[[File:FarallonTomoSlice.png|thumb|267x267px|Simplified and interpreted P- and S-wave velocity variations in the mantle across southern North America showing the subducted Farallon Plate.]]
Regional to global scale tomographic models are generally based on long wavelengths. Various models have better agreement with each other than local models due to the large feature size they image, such as [[Subduction|subducted slabs]] and [[Large low-shear-velocity provinces|superplumes]]. The trade off from whole mantle to whole earth coverage is the coarse resolution (hundreds of kilometers) and difficulty imaging small features (e.g. narrow plumes). Although often used to image different parts of the subsurface, P- and S-wave derived models broadly agree where there is image overlap. These models use data from both permanent seismic stations and supplementary temporary arrays. 
* First arrival traveltime ''P-wave'' data are used to generate the highest resolution tomographic images of the mantle. These models are limited to regions with sufficient seismograph coverage and earthquake density, therefore cannot be used for areas such as inactive plate interiors and ocean basins without seismic networks. Other phases of P-waves are used to image the deeper mantle and core.
* In areas with limited [[seismograph]] or earthquake coverage, multiple phases of ''S-waves'' can be used for tomographic models. These are of lower resolution than P-wave models, due to the distances involved and fewer bounce-phase data available. S-waves can also be used in conjunction with P-waves for differential arrival time models.
* ''Surface waves'' can be used for tomography of the crust and upper mantle where no body wave (P and S) data are available. Both Rayleigh and Love waves can be used. The low frequency waves lead to low resolution models, therefore these models have difficulty with crustal structure. ''Free oscillations'', or normal mode [[seismology]], are the long wavelength, low frequency movements of the surface of the earth which can be thought of as a type of surface wave. The frequencies of these oscillations can be obtained through [[Fourier transform]]ation of seismic data. The models based on this method are of broad scale, but have the advantage of relatively uniform data coverage as compared to data sourced directly from earthquakes. 
* ''[[Attenuation]] tomography'' attempts to extract the anaelastic signal from the elastic-dominated waveform of seismic waves. The advantage of this method is its sensitivity to temperature, thus ability to image thermal features such as mantle plumes and subduction zones. Both surface and body waves have been used in this approach. 
* ''Ambient noise tomography'' cross-correlates waveforms from random wavefields generated by oceanic and atmospheric disturbances. A major advantage of this method is that unlike other methods, it does not require an earthquake or other event to occur in order to produce results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shapiro |first1=N. M. |title=High-Resolution Surface-Wave Tomography from Ambient Seismic Noise |journal=Science |date=11 March 2005 |volume=307 |issue=5715 |pages=1615–1618 |doi=10.1126/science.1108339|pmid=15761151 |bibcode=2005Sci...307.1615S |citeseerx=10.1.1.399.6167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. A disadvantage of the method is that it requires a significant amount of time, usually a minimum of one year but several years of data collection are also common. This method has produced high-resolution images and is an area of active research. 
* [[Waveform]]s are modeled as rays in seismic analysis, but all waves are affected by the material near the [[Banana Doughnut theory|ray path.]] The finite frequency effect is the result the surrounding medium has on a seismic record. ''Finite frequency tomography'' accounts for this in determining both travel time and amplitude anomalies, increasing image resolution. This has the ability to resolve much larger variations (i.e. 10–30%) in material properties.

==Applications==
Seismic tomography can resolve anisotropy, anelasticity, density, and bulk sound density.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Variations in these parameters may be a result of thermal or chemical differences, which are attributed to processes such as mantle plumes, subducting slabs, and mineral phase changes. Larger scale features that can be imaged with tomography include the high velocities beneath [[Shield (geology)|continental shields]] and low velocities under [[Mid-ocean ridge|ocean spreading centers]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Hotspots ===
[[File:Cartoon of African LLSVP.jpg|thumb|235x235px|The African large low-shear-velocity province (superplume)]]
The mantle plume hypothesis proposes that areas of volcanism not readily explained by plate tectonics, called [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]], are a result of thermal upwelling from as deep as the core-mantle boundary that become [[diapir]]s in the crust. This is an actively contested theory,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; although tomographic images suggest there are anomalies beneath some hotspots. The best imaged of these are large low-shear-velocity provinces, or superplumes, visible on S-wave models of the lower mantle and believed to reflect both thermal and compositional differences.

The [[Yellowstone hotspot]] is responsible for volcanism at the [[Yellowstone Caldera]] and a series of extinct calderas along the [[Snake River Plain]]. The Yellowstone Geodynamic Project sought to image the plume beneath the hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Robert B.|last2=Jordan|first2=Michael|last3=Steinberger|first3=Bernhard|last4=Puskas|first4=Christine M.|last5=Farrell|first5=Jamie|last6=Waite|first6=Gregory P.|last7=Husen|first7=Stephan|last8=Chang|first8=Wu-Lung|last9=O'Connell|first9=Richard|date=2009-11-20|title=Geodynamics of the Yellowstone hotspot and mantle plume: Seismic and GPS imaging, kinematics, and mantle flow|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027309003308|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|series=The Track of the Yellowstone HotspotWhat do Neotectonics, Climate Indicators, Volcanism, and Petrogenesis Reveal about Subsurface Processes?|volume=188|issue=1–3|pages=26–56|doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2009.08.020|bibcode=2009JVGR..188...26S}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found a strong low-velocity body from ~30 to 250&amp;nbsp;km depth beneath Yellowstone and a weaker anomaly from 250 to 650&amp;nbsp;km depth which dipped 60° west-northwest. The authors attribute these features to the mantle plume beneath the hotspot being deflected eastward by flow in the upper mantle seen in S-wave models.

The [[Hawaii hotspot]] produced the [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain]]. Tomographic images show it to be 500 to 600&amp;nbsp;km wide and up to 2,000&amp;nbsp;km deep.

=== Subduction zones ===
Subducting plates are colder than the mantle into which they are moving. This creates a fast anomaly that is visible in tomographic images. Both the [[Farallon Plate|Farallon plate]] that subducted beneath the west coast of North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iris.edu/hq/files/programs/education_and_outreach/lessons_and_resources/docs/es_tomography.pdf|title=Seismic Tomography|last=|first=|date=|website=earthscope.org|publisher=Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS)|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the northern portion of the [[Indian Plate|Indian plate]] that has subducted beneath Asia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Replumaz|first=Anne|last2=Negredo|first2=Ana M.|last3=Guillot|first3=Stéphane|last4=Villaseñor|first4=Antonio|date=2010-03-01|title=Multiple episodes of continental subduction during India/Asia convergence: Insight from seismic tomography and tectonic reconstruction|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195109005666|journal=Tectonophysics|series=Convergent plate margin dynamics: New perspectives from structural geology, geophysics and geodynamic modelling|volume=483|issue=1–2|pages=125–134|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2009.10.007|bibcode=2010Tectp.483..125R}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been imaged with tomography.

==Limitations==
Global seismic networks have expanded steadily since the 1960s, but are still concentrated on continents and in seismically active regions. Oceans, particularly in the southern hemisphere, are under-covered.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Tomographic models in these areas will improve when more data becomes available. The uneven distribution of earthquakes naturally biases models to better resolution in seismically active regions.

The type of wave used in a model limits the resolution it can achieve. Longer wavelengths are able to penetrate deeper into the earth, but can only be used to resolve large features. Finer resolution can be achieved with surface waves, with the trade off that they cannot be used in models of the deep mantle. The disparity between wavelength and feature scale causes anomalies to appear of reduced magnitude and size in images. P- and S-wave models respond differently to the types of anomalies depending on the driving material property. First arrival time based models naturally prefer faster pathways, causing models based on these data to have lower resolution of slow (often hot) features.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Shallow models must also consider the significant lateral velocity variations in continental crust.

Seismic tomography provides only the current velocity anomalies. Any prior structures are unknown and the slow rates of movement in the subsurface (mm to cm per year) prohibit resolution of changes over modern timescales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Penrose/PenPDFAbstracts/Dziewonski_Adam_abs.pdf|title=Global Seismic Tomography: What we really can say and what we make up|last=Dziewonski|first=Adam|date=|website=|publisher=mantleplumes.org|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomographic solutions are non-unique. Although statistical methods can be used to analyze the validity of a model, unresolvable uncertainty remains.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This contributes to difficulty comparing the validity of different model results.

Computing power limits the amount of seismic data, number of unknowns, mesh size, and iterations in tomographic models. This is of particular importance in ocean basins, which due to limited network coverage and earthquake density require more complex processing of distant data. Shallow oceanic models also require smaller model mesh size due to the thinner crust.&lt;ref name="Liu 31–66"/&gt;

Tomographic images are typically presented with a color ramp representing the strength of the anomalies. This has the consequence of making equal changes appear of differing magnitude based on visual perceptions of color, such as the change from orange to red being more subtle than blue to yellow. The degree of color saturation can also visually skew interpretations. These factors should be considered when analyzing images.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1624">In [[mathematics]], '''Takeuti's conjecture''' is the conjecture of [[Gaisi Takeuti]] that a sequent formalisation of [[second-order logic]] has [[Cut-elimination theorem|cut-elimination]] (Takeuti 1953).  It was settled positively:
* By Tait, using a semantic technique for proving cut-elimination, based on work by Schütte (Tait 1966);
* Independently by Takahashi by a similar technique (Takahashi 1967);
* It is a corollary of [[Jean-Yves Girard]]'s syntactic proof of strong normalization for [[System F]].

Takeuti's conjecture is equivalent to the consistency of [[second-order arithmetic]] in the sense that each of the statements can be derived from each other in the weak system [[Primitive recursive arithmetic|PRA]] of arithmetic; [[consistency proof|consistency]] refers here to the truth of the [[Gödel sentence]] for second-order arithmetic. It is also equivalent to the [[strong normalization]] of the Girard/Reynold's [[System F]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''theorem''' is a [[statement (logic)|statement]] that has been [[Mathematical proof|proven]] on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theorems, and generally accepted statements, such as [[axiom]]s. A theorem is a [[logical consequence]] of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a [[deductive system]]. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally ''[[deductive]]'', in contrast to the notion of a [[scientific law]], which is ''[[experimental]]''.&lt;ref&gt;However, both theorems and scientific law are the result of investigations. See {{harvnb|Heath|1897}} Introduction, The terminology of [[Archimedes]], p. clxxxii:"theorem (θεὼρνμα) from θεωρεἳν to investigate"&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mathematical theorems are conditional statements. In this case, the proof deduces the conclusion from conditions called '''hypotheses''' or [[premise]]s. In light of the interpretation of proof as justification of truth, the conclusion is often viewed as a necessary consequence of the [[hypotheses]], namely, that the conclusion is true in case the hypotheses are true, without any further assumptions. However, the conditional could be interpreted differently in certain [[deductive system]]s, depending on the meanings assigned to the derivation rules and the conditional symbol.

Although they can be written in a completely symbolic form, for example, within the [[propositional calculus]], theorems are often expressed in a natural language such as English. The same is true of proofs, which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments, intended to convince readers of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt, and from which a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed. Such arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones—indeed, many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem, but also explains in some way ''why'' it is obviously true. In some cases, a picture alone may be sufficient to prove a theorem. Because theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to its aesthetics. Theorems are often described as being "trivial", or "difficult", or "deep", or even "beautiful". These subjective judgments vary not only from person to person, but also with time: for example, as a proof is simplified or better understood, a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial. On the other hand, a deep theorem may be stated simply, but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics. [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] is a particularly well-known example of such a theorem.

== Informal account of theorems ==

[[Logically]], many theorems are of the form of an [[indicative conditional]]: ''if A, then B''. Such a theorem does not assert ''B'', only that ''B'' is a necessary consequence of ''A''. In this case ''A'' is called the '''[[hypothesis]]''' of the theorem ("hypothesis" here is something very different from a [[conjecture]]) and ''B'' the '''conclusion''' (formally, ''A'' and ''B'' are termed the ''antecedent'' and ''consequent''). The theorem "If ''n'' is an even [[natural number]] then ''n''/2 is a natural number" is a typical example in which the hypothesis is "''n'' is an even natural number" and the conclusion is "''n''/2 is also a natural number".

To be proved, a theorem must be expressible as a precise, formal statement. Nevertheless, theorems are usually expressed in natural language rather than in a completely symbolic form, with the intention that the reader can produce a formal statement from the informal one.

It is common in mathematics to choose a number of hypotheses within a given language and declare that the theory consists of all statements provable from these hypotheses. These hypotheses form the foundational basis of the theory and are called axioms or postulates. The field of mathematics known as [[proof theory]] studies formal languages, axioms and the structure of proofs.

[[File:4CT Non-Counterexample 1.svg|frame|right|A [[Plane (mathematics)|planar]] map with five colors such that no two regions with the same color meet. It can actually be colored in this way with only four colors. The [[four color theorem]] states that such colorings are possible for any planar map, but every known proof involves a computational search that is too long to check by hand.]]
Some theorems are "trivial", in the sense that they follow from definitions, axioms, and other theorems in obvious ways and do not contain any surprising insights. Some, on the other hand, may be called "deep", because their proofs may be long and difficult, involve areas of mathematics superficially distinct from the statement of the theorem itself, or show surprising connections between disparate areas of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Deep Theorem|urlname=DeepTheorem}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep. An excellent example is [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in [[number theory]] and [[combinatorics]], among other areas.

Other theorems have a known proof that cannot easily be written down. The most prominent examples are the four color theorem and the [[Kepler conjecture]]. Both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search that is then verified by a computer program. Initially, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but it has become more widely accepted. The mathematician [[Doron Zeilberger]] has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doron Zeilberger|authorlink=Doron Zeilberger|title=Opinion 51|url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion51.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation, including polynomial identities, trigonometric identities and hypergeometric identities.&lt;ref&gt;Petkovsek et al. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}

==Provability and theoremhood==

To establish a mathematical statement as a theorem, a proof is required, that is, a line of reasoning from axioms in the system (and other, already established theorems) to the given statement must be demonstrated. However, the proof is usually considered as separate from the theorem statement. Although more than one proof may be known for a single theorem, only one proof is required to establish the status of a statement as a theorem. The [[Pythagorean theorem]] and the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]] are contenders for the title of theorem with the greatest number of distinct proofs.

==Relation with scientific theories==
{{unreferenced-section|date=February 2018}}
Theorems in mathematics and theories in science are fundamentally different in their [[epistemology]]. A scientific theory cannot be proved; its key attribute is that it is [[falsifiable]], that is, it makes predictions about the natural world that are testable by [[experiment]]s. Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory, or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity. Mathematical theorems, on the other hand, are purely abstract formal statements: the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories.

[[File:CollatzFractal.png|thumb|250px|right|The [[Collatz conjecture]]: one way to illustrate its complexity is to extend the iteration from the natural numbers to the complex numbers. The result is a [[fractal]], which (in accordance with [[universality (dynamical systems)|universality]]) resembles the [[Mandelbrot set]].]]
Nonetheless, there is some degree of empiricism and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes with the use of a powerful computer, mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof. For example, the [[Collatz conjecture]] has been verified for start values up to about 2.88&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[Riemann hypothesis]] has been verified for the first 10 trillion zeroes of the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]]. Neither of these statements is considered proved.

Such evidence does not constitute proof. For example, the [[Mertens conjecture]] is a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false, but no explicit counterexample (i.e., a natural number ''n'' for which the Mertens function ''M''(''n'') equals or exceeds the square root of ''n'') is known: all numbers less than 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; have the Mertens property, and the smallest number that does not have this property is only known to be less than the [[exponential function|exponential]] of 1.59&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;, which is approximately 10 to the power 4.3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;. Since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than 10 to the power 100 (a [[googol]]), there is no hope to find an explicit counterexample by [[exhaustive search]].

The word "theory" also exists in mathematics, to denote a body of mathematical axioms, definitions and theorems, as in, for example, [[group theory]]. There are also "theorems" in science, particularly physics, and in engineering, but they often have statements and proofs in which physical assumptions and intuition play an important role; the physical axioms on which such "theorems" are based are themselves falsifiable.

==Terminology==
A number of different terms for mathematical statements exist; these terms indicate the role statements play in a particular subject. The distinction between different terms is sometimes rather arbitrary and the usage of some terms has evolved over time.

* An '''[[axiom]]''' or '''postulate''' is a statement that is accepted without proof and regarded as fundamental to a subject. Historically these have been regarded as "self-evident", but more recently they are considered assumptions that characterize the subject of study. In classical geometry, axioms are general statements, while postulates are statements about geometrical objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plane Geometry
|first1=G.|last1=Wentworth|first2=D.E.|last2=Smith|publisher=Ginn &amp; Co.
|year=1913|chapter=Art. 46, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[definition]] is also accepted without proof since it simply gives the meaning of a word or phrase in terms of known concepts.

* An unproved statement that is believed true is called a '''conjecture''' (or sometimes a '''hypothesis''', but with a different meaning from the one discussed above). To be considered a conjecture, a statement must usually be proposed publicly, at which point the name of the proponent may be attached to the conjecture, as with [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. Other famous conjectures include the [[Collatz conjecture]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. On the other hand, [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] has always been known by that name, even before it was proved; it was never known as "Fermat's conjecture".
* A '''[[proposition]]''' is a theorem of lesser importance. This term sometimes connotes a statement with a simple proof, while the term '''theorem''' is usually reserved for the most important results or those with long or difficult proofs. Some authors never use "proposition", while some others use "theorem" only for fundamental results. In classical geometry, this term was used differently: In [[Euclid's Elements]] (c. 300 BCE), all theorems and geometric constructions were called "propositions" regardless of their importance.
* A '''[[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]''' is a "helping theorem", a proposition with little applicability except that it forms part of the proof of a larger theorem. In some cases, as the relative importance of different theorems becomes more clear, what was once considered a lemma is now considered a theorem, though the word "lemma" remains in the name. Examples include [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss's lemma]], [[Zorn's lemma]], and the [[Fundamental lemma (Langlands program)|fundamental lemma]].
* A '''[[corollary]]''' is a proposition that follows with little proof from another theorem or definition.&lt;ref&gt;Wentworth &amp; Smith Art. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Also a corollary can be a theorem restated for a more restricted [[special case]]. For example, the theorem that all angles in a [[rectangle]] are [[right angle]]s has as corollary that all angles in a [[square]] (a [[special case]] of a rectangle) are [[right angle]]s.
* {{anchor|Converse}}A '''[[Converse (logic)|converse]]''' of a theorem is a statement formed by interchanging what is given in a theorem and what is to be proved. For example, the [[isosceles triangle theorem]] states that if two sides of a triangle are equal then two angles are equal. In the converse, the given (that two sides are equal) and what is to be proved (that two angles are equal) are swapped, so the converse is the statement that if two angles of a triangle are equal then two sides are equal. In this example, the converse can be proved as another theorem, but this is often not the case. For example, the converse to the theorem that two right angles are equal angles is the statement that two equal angles must be right angles, and this is clearly not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;Follows Wentworth &amp; Smith Art. 79&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''[[generalization]]''' is a theorem which includes a previously proved theorem as a [[special case]] and hence as a corollary.

There are other terms, less commonly used, that are conventionally attached to proved statements, so that certain theorems are referred to by historical or customary names. For example:

* An '''[[Identity (mathematics)|identity]]''' is an equality, contained in a theorem, between two mathematical expressions that holds regardless of what values are used for any [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] or [[parameter]]s appearing in the expressions. Examples include [[Euler's formula]] and [[Vandermonde's identity]].
* A '''rule''' is a theorem, such as [[Bayes' rule]] and [[Cramer's rule]], that establishes a useful formula.
* A '''[[Laws of science|law]]''' or a '''[[principle]]''' is a theorem that applies in a wide range of circumstances. Examples include the [[law of large numbers]], the [[law of cosines]], [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]], [[Harnack's principle]], the [[least-upper-bound principle]], and the [[pigeonhole principle]].&lt;ref&gt;The word ''law'' can also refer to an axiom, a [[rule of inference]], or, in [[probability theory]], a [[probability distribution]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A few well-known theorems have even more idiosyncratic names. The '''division algorithm''' (see [[Euclidean division]]) is a theorem expressing the outcome of division in the natural numbers and more general rings. '''[[Bézout's identity]]''' is a theorem asserting that the greatest common divisor of two numbers may be written as a linear combination of these numbers. The '''[[Banach–Tarski paradox]]''' is a theorem in [[measure (mathematics)|measure theory]] that is [[paradox]]ical in the sense that it contradicts common intuitions about volume in three-dimensional space.

==Layout==

A theorem and its proof are typically laid out as follows:

:'''Theorem''' (name of person who proved it and year of discovery, proof or publication).
:''Statement of theorem (sometimes called the ''proposition'').''
:'''Proof'''.
:''Description of proof.''
:''End''

The end of the proof may be signalled by the letters [[Q.E.D.]] (''quod erat demonstrandum'') or by one of the [[Tombstone (typography)|tombstone]] marks "□" or "∎" meaning "End of Proof", introduced by [[Paul Halmos]] following their usage in magazine articles.

The exact style depends on the author or publication. Many publications provide instructions or [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] for typesetting in the [[Style guide|house style]].

It is common for a theorem to be preceded by [[definition]]s describing the exact meaning of the terms used in the theorem. It is also common for a theorem to be preceded by a number of propositions or lemmas which are then used in the proof. However, lemmas are sometimes embedded in the proof of a theorem, either with nested proofs, or with their proofs presented after the proof of the theorem.

Corollaries to a theorem are either presented between the theorem and the proof, or directly after the proof. Sometimes, corollaries have proofs of their own that explain why they follow from the theorem.

==Lore==

It has been estimated that over a quarter of a million theorems are proved every year.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998,  p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known [[aphorism]], [[q:Paul Erdős|"A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems"]], is probably due to [[Alfréd Rényi]], although it is often attributed to Rényi's colleague [[Paul Erdős]] (and Rényi may have been thinking of Erdős), who was famous for the many theorems he produced, the [[Erdős number|number]] of his collaborations, and his coffee drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[classification of finite simple groups]] is regarded by some to be the longest proof of a theorem. It comprises tens of thousands of pages in 500 journal articles by some 100 authors. These papers are together believed to give a complete proof, and several ongoing projects hope to shorten and simplify this proof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plus.maths.org/issue41/features/elwes/index.html An enormous theorem: the classification of finite simple groups], Richard Elwes, Plus Magazine, Issue 41 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theorem of this type is the [[four color theorem]] whose computer generated proof is too long for a human to read. It is certainly the longest known proof of a theorem whose statement can be easily understood by a layman.

==Theorems in logic==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
[[Logic]], especially in the field of proof theory, considers theorems as statements (called '''[[formula]]s''' or '''[[well formed formula]]s''') of a formal language. The statements of the language are strings of symbols and  may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and well-formed formulas. A set of '''deduction rules''', also called '''transformation rules''' or [[rules of inference]], must be provided. These deduction rules tell exactly when a formula can be derived from a set of premises. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems. However, according to [[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]], a formal system often simply defines all its well-formed formula as theorems.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter 1980&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|Also need to know the edition, and verify that in the references.  There are at least 4 English language editions of the book, in 1979, 1980, and two in 1999.|date=October 2010}}

Different sets of derivation rules give rise to different interpretations of what it means for an expression to be a theorem. Some derivation rules and formal languages are intended to capture mathematical reasoning; the most common examples use [[first-order logic]]. Other deductive systems describe [[term rewriting]], such as the reduction rules for [[lambda calculus|λ calculus]].

The definition of theorems as elements of a formal language allows for results in proof theory that study the structure of formal proofs and the structure of provable formulas. The most famous result is Gödel's incompleteness theorem; by representing theorems about basic number theory as expressions in a formal language, and then representing this language within number theory itself, Gödel constructed examples of statements that are neither provable nor disprovable from axiomatizations of number theory.
{{Clear}}&lt;!-- stop picture bleeding into completely unrelated next section --&gt;

[[File:Formal languages.svg|thumb|300px|right|This diagram shows the [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic entities]] that can be constructed from [[formal language]]s. The [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[string (computer science)|strings of symbols]] may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and [[well-formed formula]]s. A formal language can be thought of as identical to the set of its well-formed formulas. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems.]]
A theorem may be expressed in a [[formal language]] (or "formalized"). A formal theorem is the purely formal analogue of a theorem. In general, a formal theorem is a type of [[well-formed formula]] that satisfies certain logical and syntactic conditions. The notation {{tee}} &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is often used to indicate that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a theorem.

Formal theorems consist of [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] of a formal language and the [[transformation rule]]s of a formal system. Specifically, a formal theorem is always the last formula of a [[formal proof|derivation]] in some formal system each formula of which is a [[logical consequence]] of the formulas that came before it in the derivation. The initially accepted formulas in the derivation are called its '''axioms''', and are the basis on which the theorem is derived. A [[set (mathematics)|set]] of theorems is called a '''theory'''.

What makes formal theorems useful and of interest is that they can be [[interpretation (logic)|interpreted]] as true [[proposition]]s and their derivations may be interpreted as a proof of the [[truth]] of the resulting expression. A set of formal theorems may be referred to as a '''[[theory (mathematical logic)|formal theory]]'''. A theorem whose interpretation is a true statement about a formal system is called a '''[[metatheorem]]'''.

=== Syntax and semantics ===
{{Main|Syntax (logic)|Formal semantics (logic)}}

The concept of a formal theorem is fundamentally syntactic, in contrast to the notion of a ''true proposition,'' which introduces [[semantics]]. Different deductive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules (i.e. [[belief]], [[Theory of justification|justification]] or other [[Modal logic|modalities]]). The [[soundness]] of a formal system depends on whether or not all of its theorems are also [[Validity (logic)|validities]]. A validity is a formula that is true under any possible interpretation, e.g. in classical propositional logic validities are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]. A formal system is considered [[completeness (logic)|semantically complete]] when all of its tautologies are also theorems.

=== Derivation of a theorem ===
{{Main|Formal proof}}

The notion of a theorem is very closely connected to its formal proof (also called a "derivation"). To illustrate how derivations are done, we will work in a very simplified formal system. Let us call ours &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; Its alphabet consists only of two symbols { '''A''', '''B''' } and its formation rule for formulas is:
:Any string of symbols of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; that is at least three symbols long, and is not infinitely long, is a formula. Nothing else is a formula.

The single axiom of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; is:
:'''ABBA'''.

The only [[rule of inference]] (transformation rule) for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; is:
:Any occurrence of "'''A'''" in a theorem may be replaced by an occurrence of the string "'''AB'''" and the result is a theorem.

Theorems in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; are defined as those formulae that have a derivation ending with that formula. For example,

#'''ABBA''' (Given as axiom)
#'''ABBBA''' (by applying the transformation rule)
#'''ABBBAB''' (by applying the transformation rule)

is a derivation. Therefore, "'''ABBBAB'''" is a theorem of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS} \,.&lt;/math&gt; The notion of truth (or falsity) cannot be applied to the formula "'''ABBBAB'''" until an interpretation is given to its symbols. Thus in this example, the formula does not yet represent a proposition, but is merely an empty abstraction.

Two metatheorems of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; are:
:Every theorem begins with "'''A'''".
:Every theorem has exactly two "'''A'''"s.

In [[graph theory]], a '''Xuong tree''' is a [[spanning tree]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of a given graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with the property that, in the remaining graph &lt;math&gt;G-T&lt;/math&gt;, the number of [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] with an odd number of edges is as small as possible.{{r|bw}}
They are named after Nguyen Huy Xuong, who used them to characterize the [[graph embedding|cellular embeddings]] of a given graph having the largest possible [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]].{{r|x}}

According to Xuong's results, if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a Xuong tree
and the numbers of edges in the components of &lt;math&gt;G-T&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;m_1,m_2,\dots, m_k&lt;/math&gt;, then the maximum genus of an embedding of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^k\lfloor m_i/2\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.{{r|bw|x}}
Any one of these components, having &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; edges, can be partitioned into &lt;math&gt;\lfloor m_i/2\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; edge-disjoint two-edge paths, with possibly one additional left-over edge.{{r|s}}
An embedding of maximum genus may be obtained from a planar embedding of the Xuong tree by adding each two-edge path to the embedding in such a way that it increases the genus by one.{{r|bw|x}}

A Xuong tree, and a maximum-genus embedding derived from it, may be found in any graph in [[polynomial time]], by a transformation to a more general computational problem on [[matroid]]s, the [[matroid parity problem]] for [[linear matroid]]s.{{r|bw|fgm}}
