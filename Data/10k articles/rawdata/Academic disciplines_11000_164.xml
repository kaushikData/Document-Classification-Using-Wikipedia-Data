In [[computing]], ''' 10-foot user interface''' ("10-foot UI") is a [[graphical user interface]] designed for [[television]]s. Compared to [[desktop computer]] and [[smartphone]] user interfaces, it uses text and other interface elements which are much larger in order to accommodate a typical television viewing distance of 10 feet (3 meters). Additionally, the limitations of a television's [[remote control]] necessitate extra [[User experience design|user experience]] considerations to minimize user effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX06/BTB029 The Digital Home: Designing for the Ten-Foot User Interface]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://download.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/nuci3hometheatersolutionguide_v02.pdf Intel Next Unit of Computing Driving your 10 foot experience&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easyclasspage.de/mac/seite-16.html 10 foot Style / Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Growl]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The term "10-foot" is used to differentiate this user interface style from those used on desktop computers, which typically assume the user's eyes are only about two feet (60 cm) from the display. This difference in distance from the display has a huge impact on the interface design, requiring the use of extra large fonts on a television and allowing relatively few items to be shown on a television at once.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=10-foot+user+interface&amp;i=36892,00.asp#fbid=8WN9yzOrfhM PC Magazine Definition of: 10-foot user interface]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[https://developer.android.com/design/tv/style.html Style for TV]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://developer.nvidia.com/android-tv-developer-guide Android TV Developer Guide (Nvidia)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 10 foot UI is almost always designed to be operated by a simple hand-held remote control. Rather than the [[Computer mouse|mouse]] or [[touchscreen]] which are commonly used with other types of user interfaces, the remote's [[D-pad|directional pad]] is the primary means of navigation. This means that a 10-foot UI needs to arrange items on screen in a way that clearly shows which item would be next in each of the four directions of the directional pad - usually a grid layout. Also, without a mouse cursor, the currently-selected item must be highlighted in some way.

Ten-foot interfaces may resemble other [[post-WIMP]] systems graphically, due to a similar paucity of pixels, but do not assume the use of a [[touch screen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avermedia.com/avertv/upload/avermediatvsoftware/index.html AVerMedia TV Software]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://appdevconf.engagedigital.com/sessions/keys-to-successfully-building-a-10-ft-ui/# |title=Building a 10 Foot UI: Dealing With Platform Diversity |access-date=2011-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114121831/http://appdevconf.engagedigital.com/sessions/keys-to-successfully-building-a-10-ft-ui/# |archive-date=2011-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of 10 foot user interface design is normally to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible, trying to achieve a more laid-back and relaxed user experience with as few button presses as possible while still having an intuitive layout, in terms of accomplishing user goals&amp;mdash;what is often called [[user-centered design]]. Good user interface design facilitates finishing the task at hand without drawing unnecessary attention to itself. [[Graphic design]] may be utilized to support its [[usability]]; however, the design process must balance technical functionality and visual elements (e.g., [[mental model]]) to create a system that is not only operational but also usable and adaptable to changing user needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://developer.android.com/design/tv/index.html Designing for Android TV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-10-foot-home-TV-experience-so-hard-to-get-right Why is the "10 foot" home TV experience so hard to get right?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://developer.android.com/training/tv/index.html Building Apps for TV&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3236">The '''Amboseli Elephant Research Project''' is a long-term research project on the [[ethology]] of the [[African elephant]], operated by the nonprofit [[Amboseli Trust for Elephants]]. The project studies the elephant's social behavior, age structure and population dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amboseli &amp; Us: Project History|publisher=Amboseli Trust for Elephants|url=http://www.elephanttrust.org/amboseli-us#Project%20History7|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the longest running study of elephant behavior in the wild,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Border Path Is Deadly for 3 Elephants | author=[[Jane E.

The research project was initiated in 1972 by [[Cynthia Moss]] and [[Harvey Croze]] in [[Amboseli National Park]] in the south of [[Kenya]]. Relatively few poachers have been active in Amboseli Park's approximately 390&amp;nbsp;km² area. This is especially due to the [[Maasai people]], and the constant presence of tourists and researchers. Thus, Amboseli is one of the few regions in Africa where the age structure of elephants has remained undistorted. The area is monitored by [[game warden]]s and scientists throughout the year.

The subjects of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project, mostly notably the elephant matriarch [[Echo (elephant)|Echo]], have been described at length in documentaries on [[PBS]] and [[Animal Planet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Echo: An Elephant to Remember|author=Mike Birkhead|publisher=PBS|year=2010|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/echo-an-elephant-to-remember/cynthia-moss-echo-and-the-amboseli-elephants/5876/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amboseli - Dim Future for the Elephants|author=Rupi Mangat|publisher=The East African|date=March 17, 2008|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200803171482.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3089">'''Asian studies''', a term used usually in [[North America]] for [[Oriental studies]] and is concerned with the  [[Asia]]n people, their cultures, languages, history and politics. Within the Asian sphere, Asian studies combines aspects of [[sociology]], [[history]], [[cultural anthropology]] and many other disciplines to study political, cultural and economic phenomena in Asian traditional and contemporary societies. Asian studies forms a field of [[post-graduate study]] in many universities.

It is a branch of [[area studies]], and many Western universities combine Asian and [[African studies]] in a single faculty or institute, like [[SOAS]] in London.  It is often combined with [[Islamic studies]] in a similar way.  The history of the discipline in the West is covered under [[Oriental studies]].

'''Band I''' is a range of [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]] within the [[very high frequency]] (VHF) part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Band I ranges from 47 to 68 [[MHz]] for the European Broadcasting Area,&lt;ref name="freqplans"&gt;{{cite web|title=FM / TV Regional Frequency Assignment Plans|url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/terrestrial/broadcast/Pages/FMTV.aspx|accessdate=20 February 2017|publisher=ITU}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 54 to 88 MHz for the Americas&lt;ref name="freqbands"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequency Bands allocated to Terrestrial Broadcasting Services|url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/terrestrial/broadcast/Pages/Bands.aspx|accessdate=20 February 2017|publisher=ITU}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is primarily used for [[television broadcasting]] in line to [[ITU Radio Regulations]] (article 1.38). Channel spacings vary from country to country, with spacings of 6, 7 and 8 [[MHz]] being common.

==Television broadcasting usage==
In the UK, Band I was originally used by the [[BBC]] for [[monochrome]] [[405-line television system|405-line]] [[television]];&lt;ref name="Paulu1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Paulu|first=Burton|title=Television and Radio in the United Kingdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lv7awDml10C&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=11 April 2012|date=1981-10-01|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816609413|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the French former 455-line (1937-1939) then 441-line (1943-1956) transmitter on the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]], and some stations of the French monochrome [[Analog high-definition television system#French-Italian 819-line .28755i.29 system|819-line]] system used Band I. Both 405-line and 819-line systems were discontinued in the mid-1980s.  Other European countries used and still use Band I for [[576i|625-line]] analogue television, first in monochrome and later in colour.

This is now being gradually phased out with the introduction of [[digital television]] in the [[DVB-T]] standard, which is not defined for VHF Band I, though some older receivers and some modulators do support it.

In the United States, use of this band is for analog NTSC (ended June 12, 2009) and digital ATSC (current).  Digital television has problems with impulse noise interference, particularly in this band.

===Europe===
In European countries that use [[Broadcast_television_systems#ITU standards|System B]] for television broadcasting, the band is subdivided into three channels, each being 7&amp;nbsp;MHz wide:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Channel
! Frequency Range
|-
|E2||47-54&amp;nbsp;MHz
|-
|E2A||48.5-55.5&amp;nbsp;MHz
|-
|E3||54-61&amp;nbsp;MHz
|-
|E4||61-68&amp;nbsp;MHz
|-
|C||82.25-87.75&amp;nbsp;MHz
|}

Italy also uses a "outband" "channel C" (video : 82.25&amp;nbsp;MHz - audio : 87.75&amp;nbsp;MHz). It was used by the first transmitter brought in service by the [[RAI]] in [[Torino]] in the Fifties which was previously used in WW2 by the US to broadcast NTSC TV on channel A6 for military purposes, later donated to Italy, it had its video carrier shifted 1 MHz lower to accommodate the System B standard. This channel was also widely used by private local stations until the switch over to DVB-T. 

Some countries use slightly different frequencies or don't use Band 1 at all for terrestrial broadcast television. The fast growing of digital television as well as the susceptibility of this band to interference during [[Sporadic E propagation|E skip]] events in all European countries is accompanied by the progressive closedown of band I analog transmitters, e.g. former French-language Swiss Television transmitter at [[La Dôle]] near [[Geneva]] on channel E4 or French analog transmitters used by [[Canal Plus]] for its Pay-TV  [[VHF]] network, e.g. [[Besançon]] ([[Lomont]]) and [[Carcassonne]] ([[Pic de Nore]]) both on French channel "L-3".

=== Russia and other former members of [[International Radio and Television Organisation|OIRT]] ===

In the countries that use [[Broadcast_television_systems#ITU standards|System D]] television broadcast system, the channel allocation in the VHF-I band is as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Channel
! Frequency Range
|-
|1||48.5-56.5&amp;nbsp;MHz
|-
|2||58-66&amp;nbsp;MHz
|}

===North America===
The band is subdivided into five channels for television broadcasting, each occupying 6&amp;nbsp;MHz (System M). Channel 1 is not being used for broadcasting anymore.

{| class="wikitable"

|}

==FM Radio Usage==
The upper end of this band, 87.5 to 88&amp;nbsp;MHz, is the lower end of the [[FM radio]] band. In the United States, the FCC will occasionally issue a license for 87.9&amp;nbsp;MHz (though it only does so on rare occurrences and special circumstances; [[KSFH]] is the only standalone station that uses 87.9 currently); 87.7, which is approximately the same frequency as the audio feed of channel 6, is used by some television licenses to broadcast primarily to radio, such as [[Pulse 87]]'s stations.

'''Benevolence and the Mandate of Heaven: Transformation of pre-Qin Confucian Classics''' is a book by a [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]] historian [[Olga Gorodetskaya]] (Kuo Ching-yun), published in 2010 in [[Taipei]]. The book concerns itself with the [[Confucian]] philosophical concepts of [[Ren (Confucianism)|Benevolence (Ren)]] and the [[Mandate of Heaven]] and their evolution during the period before the establishment of the empire by [[Qin dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsm.org.cn/show_news.php?id=287&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/8717200/%E8%A6%AA%E4%BB%81%E8%88%87%E5%A4%A9%E5%91%BD 親仁與天命 in Academia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of a '''biotic pump''' pertains to the importance of forests in the [[water cycle]], specifically, in determining the levels of rainfall a region will receive. It states that an increased amount of evaporation or [[transpiration]] will cause a reduction in atmospheric pressure as clouds form, which will subsequently cause moist air to be drawn to regions where evaporation is at its highest. In a desert this will correspond to the sea whereas in a forest, moist air from the sea will be drawn inland. The theory predicts two different types of coast to contentinental rainfall patterns, first in a forested area one can expect no decrease in rainfall as one moves inland in contrast to a deforested region where one observes an exponential decrease in annual rainfall. Whereas it is true current global climate models fit these patterns as well, it is argued this is due to [[parametrization]] and not the veracity of the theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheil|first=Douglas|last2=Murdiyarso|first2=Daniel|date=2009-04-01|title=How Forests Attract Rain: An Examination of a New Hypothesis|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/59/4/341/346941|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=59|issue=4|pages=341–347|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.4.12|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory is in contradiction of the more traditional view that surface winds are solely a direct product of differences in surface heating and heat released from condensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://repository.usergioarboleda.edu.co/handle/11232/397|title=How the Biotic Pump links the hydrological and the rainforest to climate : ¿Is it for real? ¿How can we prove it?|last=Bunyard|first=Peter Paul|date=2015-08-21|publisher=Universidad Sergio Arboleda|isbn=9789588745893|language=en|doi=10.22518/9789588745886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/clearing-forests-may-transform-local-and-global-climate/ |title=Clearing Forests May Transform Local—and Global—Climate |last=Schwartz |first=Judith D. |work=Scientific American |access-date=2017-12-29 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators of the theory argue that phase changes in water play a greater role in atmospheric dynamics than currently acknowledged.

== Interpretation of the scale ==
The seven types of stool are:&lt;ref name="Mínguez Pérez-2009"/&gt;

*Type 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass)
*Type 2: Sausage-shaped, but lumpy
*Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface
*Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft
*Type 5: Soft blobs with clear cut edges (easy to pass)
*Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool
*Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid

Types 1 and 2 indicate [[constipation]], with 4 being the ideal stools as they are easy to [[defecation|defecate]] while not containing excess liquid, 5 tending towards &lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE SPELLING OF DIARRHOEA, THE BRISTOL STOOL SCALE ORIGINATED IN BRITAIN AND SHOULD THEREFORE ADOPT THE BRITISH SPELLING - SEE WP:ENGVAR --&gt;[[diarrhea|diarrhoea]], and 6 and 7 indicate diarrhoea.&lt;ref name="LacyPatel2017"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Lacy BE, Patel NK| title=Rome Criteria and a Diagnostic Approach to Irritable Bowel Syndrome. | journal=J Clin Med | year= 2017 | volume= 6 | issue= 11 | pages=  99| pmid=29072609 | doi=10.3390/jcm6110099 | pmc=5704116 | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the initial study, in the population examined in this scale, the type 1 and 2 stools were more prevalent in females, while the type 5 and 6 stools were more prevalent in males; furthermore, 80% of subjects who reported [[rectal tenesmus]] (urgency to defecate) had type 7. These and other data have allowed the scale to be validated.&lt;ref name="Mínguez Pérez-2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mínguez Pérez|first1=M.|first2=A.|last2=Benages Martínez|title=The Bristol scale - a useful system to assess stool form?|journal=Rev Esp Enferm Dig|volume=101|issue=5|pages=305–11|date=May 2009|pmid=19527075|doi=10.4321/s1130-01082009000500001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bristol stool scale is also very sensitive to changes in intestinal transit time caused by medications, such as [[diarrhea|antidiarrhoeal]] [[loperamide]] or [[senna glycoside|senna]], [[anthraquinone]] substance with [[laxative]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=SJ.|first2=KW.|last2=Heaton|title=Stool form scale as a useful guide to intestinal transit time|journal=Scand J Gastroenterol|volume=32|issue=9|pages=920–4|date=September 1997|doi=10.3109/00365529709011203|pmid=9299672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Developed and proposed for the first time in [[England]] by Dr. Stephen Lewis and Dr. Ken Heaton at the University Department of Medicine, [[Bristol Royal Infirmary]], it was suggested by the authors as a clinical assessment tool in 1997 in the journal ''[[Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology]]''&lt;ref name="Lewis-1997"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lewis SJ, Heaton KW|title=Stool form scale as a useful guide to intestinal transit time|journal=Scand.

That conclusion has since been challenged as having limited validity for Types 1 and 2;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rao SS, Camilleri M, Hasler WL, Maurer AH, Parkman HP, Saad R, Scott MS, Simren M, Soffer E, Szarka L|title=Evaluation of gastrointestinal transit in clinical practice: position paper of the American and European Neurogastroenterology and Motility Societies|journal=Neurogastroenterol.

=== Diagnosis of IBS ===
{{see also|irritable bowel syndrome|Rome process}}
Patients with [[irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]] or irritable bowel syndrome typically report that they suffer with abdominal [[cramp]]s and [[constipation]].
In some patients, chronic constipation is interspersed with brief episodes of [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]]; while a minority of patients with IBS have only diarrhoea.
The presentation of symptoms is usually months or years and commonly patients consult different doctors, without great success, and doing various specialized investigations.
It notices a strong correlation of the reported symptoms with [[stress (biology)|stress]]; indeed diarrhoeal discharges are associated with [[emotion|emotional phenomena]].
IBS blood is present only if the disease is associated with [[hemorrhoid|haemorrhoid]]s.&lt;ref name="Longstreth-2006"/&gt;

The research results (see table) indicate that about 1 in 5 people have a slow transit (type 1 and 2 stools), while 1 in 12 has an accelerated transit (type 5 and 6 stools). Moreover, the nature of the stool is affected by age, sex, [[body mass index]], whether or not they had [[cholecystectomy]] and possible [[psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] components ([[somatization|somatisation]]); there were no effects from factors such as [[smoking]], [[alcoholism|alcohol]], the level of education, a history of [[appendectomy]] or familiarity with gastrointestinal diseases, civil state, or the use of [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptive]]s.

=== Therapeutic evaluation ===
Several investigations correlate the Bristol stool scale in response to medications or therapies, in fact, in one study was also used to titrate the dose more finely than one drug ([[colestyramine]]) in subjects with [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]] and faecal incontinence.&lt;ref name="Remes-Troche-2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Remes-Troche|first1=JM.|first2=R.|last2=Ozturk|first3=C.|last3=Philips|first4=M.|last4=Stessman|first5=SS.|last5=Rao|title=Cholestyramine--a useful adjunct for the treatment of patients with fecal incontinence|journal=Int J Colorectal Dis|volume=23|issue=2|pages=189–94|date=February 2008|doi=10.1007/s00384-007-0391-y|pmid=17938939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Centre for India &amp; Global Business''' ('''CIGB''') was launched in March 2009 as part of [[Cambridge Judge Business School]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], [[England]], to support the university’s growing engagement with India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge-india.org/ Cambridge-India Partnership].&lt;/ref&gt;  As a research centre and an engagement platform CIGB is dedicated to the study of India's rapidly expanding role in the global [[knowledge economy]].

==History==
CIGB was established with initial funding from the [[BP]] foundation. The academic director of CIGB is [[Jaideep Prabhu|Professor Jaideep Prabhu]], the first [[University of Cambridge|Jawaharlal Nehru Professor of Indian Business and Enterprise]] at the University of Cambridge, who took up the post in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2008050202 Appointment of the first Jawaharlal Nehru Professor at Cambridge], press release from Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt; The founding Executive Director of CIGB was [[Navi Radjou]], who served between January 2009 and June 2011. The Centre has 14 other academic members, including [[Cambridge Judge Business School]] faculty and PhD students.

==Research activities==
CIGB conducts research in collaboration with a global network of academic partners around three complementary themes:
*''India as a global innovation hub'': how and why firms from around the world are increasingly locating their global R&amp;D and innovation activities in India
*''Indian firms going global'': how Indian firms are going global on the back of innovation in India or in order to become more innovative relative to global competitors
*''Co-innovation with the'' [[bottom of the pyramid|''bottom of the socio-economic pyramid'']] (mass markets): how multinational and Indian firms are engaging those who live on less than $5 a day as value-adding partners through innovative products, services and business models.
A major issue underlying these three themes is how India is emerging as a learning laboratory for affordable and sustainable innovation to deal with the global challenges of scarcity and diversity.

The academic projects undertaken by CIGB involve field research in India which CIGB-related faculty visit frequently in order to collect data and conduct interviews with local policy-makers, entrepreneurs, and corporate executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-india.org/visits/|title=Cambridge-India Activity: : University of Cambridge: Cambridge and India|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=October 11, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831222345/http://www.cambridge-india.org/visits/|archivedate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIGB produces case studies that feed into its outreach and networks activities. Its research has been featured in leading newspapers and magazines worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-cio.com/blog/july-2010/polycentric-innovation The New Shape of Innovation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725141517/http://www.i-cio.com/blog/july-2010/polycentric-innovation |date=July 25, 2010 }}, Global Intelligence for the CIO, 19 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outreach and networks==
CIGB also hosts conferences and seminars that bring together academics, corporate leaders, and policy-makers from all over the world to discuss and disseminate latest research findings as well as policy and industry best practices. These events are hosted both in Cambridge as well as in major Indian cities. For instance, in March 2009, Professor Jaideep Prabhu, Director of CIGB, delivered his inaugural lecture in [[New Delhi]], which was chaired by Mr [[Montek Singh Ahluwalia]], Deputy Chairman of the Indian Planning Commission. In May 2009, CIGB hosted in [[Cambridge]] a major conference titled “''Innovation in India and China: How to Create Value from Emerging Markets'',” which explored the rise of [[India]] and [[China]] as both fast-growing global markets and world-class sources of innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2009050105|title=Latest news|work=University of Cambridge|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/events/2009/090518_innovation/index.html Proceedings from the “Innovation in India and China” conference], CIGB website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, CIGB has also hosted a number of speakers including: [[Nandan Nilekani]], Chairman of the new [[Unique Identification Authority of India]] (UIDAI) and former Co-Chairman of [[Infosys Technologies]] (April 2009); former Indian president [[A.P.J. Abdul Kalam|Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]](June 2009);&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge-India Partnership, Cambridge-India Activitiy, September 2008 onwards, University of Cambridge [http://www.india.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/events/2009/090603_abdul_kalam.html Creative Leadership in the Global Knowledge Economy], Dr Abdul Kalam’s lecture at Judge Business School, 9 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ravi Kant (Indian executive)|Ravi Kant]], Vice-Chairman of [[Tata Motors]]; and Dr [[Ramesh Mashelkar]], former Director General of the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]], who delivered the inaugural BP Annual Lecture at Cambridge Judge Business Business on 21 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/events/2010/100621_mashelkar.html Visit of Dr R.A. Mashelkar to Cambridge], CIGB website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online engagement==
In November 2009, at the [[World Economic Forum]]’s India Economic Summit, CIGB launched Indovations.Net, an interactive, multimedia website that educates users worldwide about innovations in India across five domains: business, social, energy/environment, art/culture, and science &amp; technology. This website addresses a fundamental questions such as, What can the world learn from India-inspired innovation — or [[Indovation]] — and how people can benefit from it, etc.

Prof Jaideep Prabhu and Navi Radjou write [[blog]] posts on innovation, [[emerging markets]], and global leadership on the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/search/radjou%25252520prabhu/ Blog posts by Prof Jaideep Prabhu and Navi Radjou], [http://hbr.org/ HBR.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chimie ParisTech''' (officially '''École nationale supérieure de chimie de Paris''' (''National Chemical Engineering Institute in Paris''), also known as '''ENSCP''' or '''Chimie Paris'''), founded in 1896 within the [[University of Paris]], is an [[Engineering education|engineering school]] and a constituent college of [[PSL Research University]] specialised in [[Chemistry|chemical science]]. It is located in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]].

The students enter the school after highly competitive exams known as the ''[[:fr:Concours Communs Polytechniques|Concours Communs Polytechniques]]'', following at least two years of ''[[classes préparatoires]]''. The school is known as France's most selective chemical engineering college&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccp.scei-concours.fr/sccp.php?page=cpge/statistique/statistique_accueil_cpge.html&amp;onglet=statistiques CCP : un concours pour écoles d'ingénieurs]. Ccp.scei-concours.fr (2013-09-16). Retrieved on 2014-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The school is a research center hosting ten laboratories which conduct high level research in various fields of chemistry.

==History==
The '''École nationale supérieure de chimie de Paris''' was founded in 1896 by [[Charles Friedel]], a chemist and mineralogist who headed the school until 1899. At the time, the school was called the '''Laboratoire de chimie pratique et industrielle'''. It was located in the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]] (rue Michelet), where it stayed until 1923.

After the death of Friedel, [[Henri Moissan]] took the reins of the school. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] for chemistry in 1906, while he was director. Moissan made student admission subject to competitive exams and renamed the school '''Institut de chimie appliquée''' (Institute of Applied Chemistry).

In 1907, the school began delivering a prestigious masters of engineering. In the same year, Moissan died and a transitional directorate was created. Soon thereafter, Camille Chabrié was named director. The school closed when [[World War I]] started and reopened in 1916. This was also the first year a female student was admitted; the ENSCP was one of the first engineering schools in France to do so.

In 1923, the school moved to its current location, on the rue Pierre et Marie Curie (in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]]). The buildings were designed and built by [[Henri-Paul Nénot]], architect of the [[Sorbonne]]. In 1932, the school became '''l'Institut de Chimie de Paris''' (Paris Institute of Chemistry). Finally, in 1948, it became the '''École nationale supérieure de chimie de Paris''' (ENSCP).

The [[enzyme]] '''citrate synthase''' [[Enzyme Commission number|E.C.]] 2.3.3.1 (previously 4.1.3.7)] exists in nearly all living cells and stands as a pace-making enzyme in the first step of the [[citric acid cycle]] (or [[Krebs cycle]]).&lt;ref name = "Weigand_1986"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiegand G, Remington SJ | title = Citrate synthase: structure, control, and mechanism | journal = Annual Review of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry | date = 1986 | volume = 15 | pages = 97–117 | pmid = 3013232 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bb.15.060186.000525 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Citrate synthase is localized within [[eukaryotic]] cells in the [[mitochondrial matrix]], but is encoded by nuclear [[DNA]] rather than mitochondrial. It is synthesized using cytoplasmic [[ribosomes]], then transported into the mitochondrial matrix.
 
Citrate synthase is commonly used as a quantitative enzyme marker for the presence of intact [[mitochondria]].

Citrate synthase [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the [[condensation reaction]] of the two-carbon [[acetate]] residue from [[acetyl coenzyme A]] and a molecule of four-carbon [[oxaloacetate]] to form the six-carbon [[citrate]]:&lt;ref name = "Weigand_1986"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Oxaloacetate is regenerated after the completion of one round of the Krebs cycle.

Oxaloacetate is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme. This induces the enzyme to change its conformation, and creates a binding site for the acetyl-CoA. Only when this [[citroyl-CoA]] has formed will another conformational change cause thioester [[hydrolysis]] and release coenzyme A. This ensures that the energy released from the thioester bond cleavage will drive the condensation.

Citrate synthase's 437 amino acid residues are organized into two main subunits, each consisting of 20 alpha-helices.  These alpha helices compose approximately 75% of citrate synthase's [[tertiary structure]], while the remaining residues mainly compose irregular extensions of the structure, save a single beta-sheet of 13 residues.  Between these two subunits,  a single cleft exists containing the active site.  Two binding sites can be found therein: one reserved for citrate or oxaloacetate and the other for Coenzyme A.  The active site contains three key residues: His274, His320, and Asp375 that are highly selective in their interactions with substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodsell | first1 = D.S. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Citrate Synthase | journal = Molecule of the Month | publisher = RCSB Protein Data Bank | date = 1 September 2007 | volume = | doi = 10.2210/rcsb_pdb/mom_2007_9 }}; {{PDB|1CSC|5CSC|5CTS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanism ===

Citrate synthase has three key [[amino acids]] in its [[active site]] (known as the [[catalytic triad]]) which catalyze the conversion of [[acetyl-CoA]] [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CC(=O)−SCoA] and [[oxaloacetate]] [&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(=O)CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] into [[citrate]] [&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(OH)(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] and H−SCoA in an [[aldol condensation]] reaction.  This conversion begins with the negatively charged carboxylate side chain oxygen atom of Asp-375 deprotonating acetyl CoA’s alpha carbon atom to form an enolate anion which in turn is neutralized by protonation by His-274 to form an [[enol]] intermediate [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=C(OH)−SCoA]. At this point, the epsilon nitrogen lone pair of electrons on His-274 formed in the last step abstracts the hydroxyl enol proton to reform an enolate anion that initiates a [[nucleophilic]] attack on the oxaloacetate’s carbonyl carbon [&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(=O)CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] which in turn [[deprotonation|deprotonate]] the epsilon nitrogen atom of His-320.  This [[nucleophilic addition]] results in the formation of citroyl−CoA [&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(=O)−SCoA].  At this point, a water molecule is deprotonated by the epsilon nitrogen atom of His-320 and [[hydrolysis]] is initiated.  One of the oxygen’s lone pairs nucleophilically attacks the [[carbonyl]] carbon of citroyl−CoA.  This forms a tetrahedral intermediate and results in the ejection of −SCoA as the carbonyl reforms.  The −SCoA is protonated to form HSCoA.  Finally, the hydroxyl added to the carbonyl in the previous step is deprotonated and citrate [&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(OH)(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] is formed.&lt;ref name = "Lehninger"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Cox | first1 = David L. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = Michael M. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | date = 2005 | publisher = W.H.

=== Inhibition ===

The enzyme is inhibited by high ratios of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]:[[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], acetyl-CoA:CoA, and [[NADH]]:[[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]], as high concentrations of ATP, acetyl-CoA, and NADH show that the energy supply is high for the cell.  It is also inhibited by [[succinyl-CoA]], which resembles Acetyl-coA and acts as a competitive inhibitor to acetyl-CoA and a noncompetitive inhibitor to oxaloacetate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Colleen M.|last2=Williamson|first2=John R.|date=1971-10-15|title=Inhibition of citrate synthase by succinyl-CoA and other metabolites|url=https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/0014-5793(71)80400-3|journal=FEBS Letters|volume=18|issue=1|pages=35–38|doi=10.1016/0014-5793(71)80400-3|issn=0014-5793}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Citrate]] inhibits the reaction and is an example of product inhibition.
The inhibition of citrate synthase by acetyl-CoA analogues has also been well documented and has been used to prove the existence of a single active site.  These experiments have revealed that this single site alternates between two forms, which participate in ligase and hydrolase activity respectively.&lt;ref name = "Bayer_1981"/&gt;  This protein may use the [[morpheein]] model of [[allosteric regulation]].&lt;ref name=pmid22182754&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Selwood T, Jaffe EK | title = Dynamic dissociating homo-oligomers and the control of protein function | journal = Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics | volume = 519 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–43 | date = Mar 2012 | pmid = 22182754 | pmc = 3298769 | doi = 10.1016/j.abb.2011.11.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''City-Data''' is an [[Illinois]]-based [[social networking]] and information website that presents data and information pertaining to [[United States]] cities, and offers public [[online forum]]s for discussion. US cities, counties, zip codes, and neighborhoods are profiled and compared using governmental data about [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|race]], [[income]], [[education]], [[crime]], [[weather]], [[House|housing]], [[map]]s, [[air pollution]], and [[religion]]s. The site contains information about home value estimates (including recent home sales), local businesses, schools (including their demographics and test scores), hospitals, libraries, tourist attractions, local businesses, restaurant inspection findings, building permits, bridge conditions, hotels, water systems, airports, cell phone towers, property tax assessments, and car accidents.

City-data.com is owned and operated by Advameg, Inc. of [[Hinsdale, Illinois]].  The information on the website includes consumer names and street addresses, obtained via [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] requests and other public records; City-Data has an opt-out feature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/delrequest/list.php|title=Requests to disassociate name from street-level assessment address|work=city-data.com|accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to break the web-visible association between names and street addresses, but does not remove the consumer names themselves.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
In biology, '''coevolution''' occurs when two or more [[species]] reciprocally affect each other's [[evolution]].

[[Charles Darwin]] mentioned evolutionary interactions between [[flowering plants]] and [[insect]]s in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859). The term coevolution was coined by [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[Peter H. Raven]] in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution can play an important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nuismer|first=Scott |date=2017 |title=Introduction to coevolutionary theory|url=http://macmillanlearning.com/Catalog/product/introductiontocoevolutionarytheory-firstedition-nuismer/valueoptions|location=New York|publisher=W.F. Freeman |page=395 |isbn=978-1-319-10619-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nuismer|first=Scott |date=2017 |title=Introduction to coevolutionary theory|url=http://macmillanlearning.com/Catalog/product/introductiontocoevolutionarytheory-firstedition-nuismer/valueoptions|location=New York|publisher=W.F. Freeman |page=395 |isbn=978-1-319-10619-5  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each party in a coevolutionary relationship exerts [[Selection (biology)|selective pressures]] on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[host–parasite coevolution|host-parasite]], and [[predation|predator-prey]] relationships between species, as well as [[intraspecific competition|competition within]] or [[interspecific competition|between species]]. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an [[evolutionary arms race]] between the species involved. '''Pairwise''' or '''specific coevolution''', between exactly two species, is not the only possibility; in '''guild''' or '''diffuse coevolution''', several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and [[pollinator|pollinating]] insects such as [[bee]]s, [[fly|flies]], and [[beetle]]s.

Coevolution is primarily a biological concept, but researchers have applied it by analogy to fields such as [[computer science]], [[sociology]], and [[astronomy]].

==Mutualism==
{{main|Mutualism (biology)}}

Coevolution is the [[evolution]] of two or more [[species]] which reciprocally affect each other, sometimes creating a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic relationship]] between the species. Such relationships can be of many different types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coevolution |author=[[Douglas J. Futuyma|Futuyma, D. J.]] and M. Slatkin (editors) |year=1983 |publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] |isbn=0-87893-228-3 |pages=whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Coevolutionary Process |author=Thompson, J. N.|year=1994 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-79759-7 |pages=whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flowering plants ===

Flowers appeared and diversified relatively suddenly in the fossil record, creating what [[Charles Darwin]] described as the "abominable mystery" of how they had evolved so quickly; he considered whether coevolution could be the explanation.&lt;ref name="CardinalDanforth2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Friedman,  W.

Modern [[entomophily|insect-pollinated (entomophilous) flowers]] are conspicuously coadapted with insects to ensure pollination and in return to reward the [[pollinator]]s with nectar and pollen. The two groups have coevolved for over 100 million years, creating a complex network of interactions. Either they evolved together, or at some later stages they came together, likely with pre-adaptations, and became mutually adapted.&lt;ref name=Lunau&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lunau |first1=Klaus |title=Adaptive radiation and coevolution — pollination biology case studies |journal=Organisms Diversity &amp; Evolution |date=2004 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=207–224 |doi=10.1016/j.ode.2004.02.002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439609204000388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pollan, Michael |title=[[The Botany of Desire|The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-eye View of the World]] |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=0-7475-6300-4 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term coevolution was coined by [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[Peter H. Raven]] in 1964, to describe the evolutionary interactions of plants and butterflies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ehrlich | first1=Paul R. |author1link=Paul R.

Several highly successful [[insect]] groups—especially the [[Hymenoptera]] (wasps, bees and ants) and [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies) as well as many types of [[Diptera]] (flies) and [[Coleoptera]] (beetles)—evolved in conjunction with [[flowering plants]] during the [[Cretaceous]] (145 to 66 million years ago). The earliest bees, important pollinators today, appeared in the early Cretaceous.&lt;ref name=Bristol&gt;{{cite web |title=Coevolution of angiosperms and insects |url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Angiosperms/coevolution.htm |publisher=University of Bristol Palaeobiology Research Group |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of wasps [[sister clade|sister]] to the bees evolved at the same time as flowering plants, as did the Lepidoptera.&lt;ref name=Bristol/&gt; Further, all the major [[clade]]s of bees first appeared between the middle and late Cretaceous, simultaneously with the adaptive radiation of the [[eudicots]] (three quarters of all angiosperms), and at the time when the angiosperms became the world's dominant plants on land.&lt;ref name="CardinalDanforth2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cardinal |first1=Sophie |last2=Danforth |first2=Bryan N. |title=Bees diversified in the age of eudicots |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |date=2013 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.2686 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1755/20122686 |volume=280 |issue=1755 |pages=20122686 |pmid=23363629 |pmc=3574388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three aspects of flowers appear to have coevolved between flowering plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is, to approach it, and to identify where to land and finally to feed.

====Birds and ornithophilous flowers====

[[File:Purple-throated carib hummingbird feeding.jpg|thumb|left|[[Purple-throated carib]] feeding from and pollinating a flower]]

[[Hummingbird]]s and ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers have evolved a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship. The flowers have [[nectar]] suited to the birds' diet, their color suits the birds' vision and their shape fits that of the birds' bills. The blooming times of the flowers have also been found to coincide with hummingbirds' breeding seasons. The floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species. These flowers also tend to be more ornate, complex, and showy than their insect pollinated counterparts. It is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first, and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time. There is not much scientific support for instances of the reverse of this divergence: from ornithophily to insect pollination. The diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species, and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species can be attributed to the direction of the shift in pollinator preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kay |first1=Kathleen M.|last2=Reeves |first2=Patrick A. |last3=Olmstead |first3=Richard G. |last4=Schemske|first4=Douglas W. |title=Rapid speciation and the evolution of hummingbird pollination in neotropical Costus subgenus Costus (Costaceae): evidence from nrDNA ITS and ETS sequences |journal=American Journal of Botany |date=2005 |volume=92 |issue=11|pages=1899–1910 |doi=10.3732/ajb.92.11.1899 |pmid=21646107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This meets the birds' high energy requirements, the most important determinants of flower choice.&lt;ref name="Stiles"/&gt; In ''[[Mimulus]]'', an increase in red pigment in petals and flower nectar volume noticeably reduces the proportion of pollination by bees as opposed to hummingbirds; while greater flower surface area increases bee pollination.

Following their respective breeding seasons, several species of hummingbirds occur at the same locations in [[North America]], and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have [[convergent evolution|converged]] to a common [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the [[Corolla (flower)#Corolla|corolla]] tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill in a particular way when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows the plant to place [[pollen]] on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological [[co-adaptation]]s.&lt;ref name="Stiles"/&gt;

Ornithophilous flowers need to be conspicuous to birds.&lt;ref name="Stiles"/&gt; Birds have their greatest spectral sensitivity and finest hue discrimination at the red end of the [[visual spectrum]],&lt;ref name="Stiles"/&gt; so red is particularly conspicuous to them. Hummingbirds may also be able to see ultraviolet "colors". The prevalence of ultraviolet patterns and nectar guides in nectar-poor entomophilous (insect-pollinated) flowers warns the bird to avoid these flowers.&lt;ref name="Stiles"/&gt; Each of the two subfamilies of hummingbirds, the [[Phaethornithinae]] (hermits) and the [[Trochilinae]], has evolved in conjunction with a particular set of flowers. Most Phaethornithinae species are associated with large [[monocotyledon]]ous herbs, while the Trochilinae prefer [[dicotyledon]]ous plant species.&lt;ref name="Stiles"/&gt;

The genus ''[[Ficus]]'' is composed of 800 species of vines, shrubs, and trees, including the cultivated fig, defined by their [[syconium]]s, the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside.

Correlated mutations between the two species enter them into an evolution arms race. Whichever organism, host or parasite, that cannot keep up with the other will be eliminated from their habitat, as the species with the higher average population fitness survives. This race is known as the [[Red Queen hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Van Valen, L. |date=1973 |title=A New Evolutionary Law |journal=Evolutionary Theory |volume=1 |pages=1–30}} cited in: [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/REDQUEEN.html The Red Queen Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that sexual reproduction allows a host to stay just ahead of its parasite, similar to the [[Red Queen's race]] in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'': "it takes all the running ''you'' can do, to keep in the same place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Carroll | first=Lewis| authorlink=Lewis Carroll| origyear=1871 | title=Through the Looking-glass: And what Alice Found There| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJJZAAAAYAAJ | publisher=Macmillan | date=1875 | page=42| quote=it takes all the running ''you'' can do, to keep in the same place.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The host reproduces sexually, producing some offspring with immunity over its parasite, which then evolves in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep10004 |last=Rabajante |first=J.| display-authors=etal |title=Red Queen dynamics in multi-host and multi-parasite interaction system |journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |year=2015 |volume=5 |pages=10004 |pmid=25899168 |url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150422/srep10004/full/srep10004.html |pmc=4405699|bibcode=2015NatSR...510004R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parasite/host relationship probably drove the prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords a better chance of developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual reproduction works thanks to ever-evolving host, parasite relationships |website=PhysOrg |url=http://phys.org/news/2011-07-sexual-reproduction-ever-evolving-host-parasite.html |date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Morran, L.T. |author2=Schmidt, O.G. |author3=Gelarden, I.A. |author4=Parrish, R.C.

===Brood parasites===
{{main|Brood parasitism}}

[[Brood parasite|Brood parasitism]] demonstrates close coevolution of host and parasite, for example in [[cuckoos]]. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests of other species, ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong negative impact on the host's reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.&lt;ref name=Weiblen&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weiblen |first1=George D. |title=Interspecific Coevolution |url=http://geo.cbs.umn.edu/Weiblen2003.pdf |publisher=Macmillan |date=May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Rothstein | first1=S.I | year=1990 | title=A model system for coevolution: avian brood parasitism | url=| journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=21 | issue=| pages=481–508 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.21.1.481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antagonistic coevolution===

Antagonistic coevolution is seen in the [[harvester ant]] species ''[[Pogonomyrmex barbatus]]'' and ''[[Pogonomyrmex rugosus]]'', in a relationship both parasitic and mutualistic. The queens are unable to produce worker ants by mating with their own species. Only by crossbreeding can they produce workers. The winged females act as parasites for the males of the other species as their sperm will only produce sterile hybrids. But because the colonies are fully dependent on these hybrids to survive, it is also mutualistic. While there is no genetic exchange between the species, they are unable to evolve in a direction where they become too genetically different as this would make crossbreeding impossible.&lt;ref name="Herrmann Cahan pp. 20141771–20141771"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Herrmann | first=M. | last2=Cahan | first2=S.

==Predators and prey==
[[File:Leopard kill - KNP - 001.jpg|thumb|left|Predator and prey: a [[leopard]] killing a [[bushbuck]]]]
{{main|Predation}}

[[Predator]]s and prey interact and coevolve, the predator to catch the prey more effectively, the prey to escape. The coevolution of the two mutually imposes [[selective pressure]]s. These often lead to an [[evolutionary arms race]] between prey and predator, resulting in [[antipredator adaptation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Predator-Prey Relationships|url=http://necsi.edu/projects/evolution/co-evolution/pred-prey/co-evolution_predator.html|publisher=New England Complex Systems Institute|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same applies to [[herbivore]]s, animals that eat plants, and the plants that they eat. In the [[Rocky Mountains]], [[red squirrel]]s and [[crossbill]]s (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the [[lodgepole pine]]. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, making it more difficult for squirrels to get at the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{cite web |title=Coevolution |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_33 |publisher=University of California Berkeley |accessdate=17 January 2017}} and the two following pages of the web article.&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of coevolution listed so far have been described as if they operated pairwise (also called specific coevolution), in which traits of one species have evolved in direct response to traits of a second species, and vice versa. This is not always the case. Another evolutionary mode arises where evolution is still reciprocal, but is among a group of species rather than exactly two. This is called guild or diffuse coevolution. For instance, a trait in several species of [[flowering plant]], such as offering its [[nectar]] at the end of a long tube, can coevolve with a trait in one or several species of pollinating insects, such as a long proboscis. More generally, flowering plants are pollinated by insects from different families including [[bee]]s, [[fly|flies]], and [[beetle]]s, all of which form a broad guild of pollinators which respond to the nectar or pollen produced by flowers.&lt;ref name=Juenger&gt;Juenger, Thomas, and Joy Bergelson.

===In architecture===
The concept of coevolution was introduced in architecture by the Danish architect-urbanist [[Henrik Valeur]] as an antithesis to the concept of "star-architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://henrikvaleur.dk/biography/ |title=Henrik Valeur's biography |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the curator of the Danish Pavilion at the [[10th International Architecture Exhibition|2006 Venice Biennale of Architecture]] he conceived and orchestrated an exhibition project named 'Co-evolution', awarded the Golden Lion for Best National Pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dac.dk/en/dac-life/exhibitions/2006/co-evolution/about-co-evolution/ |title=About CO-EVOLUTION |publisher=Danish Architecture Centre |accessdate=2015-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120011414/http://www.dac.dk/en/dac-life/exhibitions/2006/co-evolution/about-co-evolution/ |archivedate=2015-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition included urban planning projects for the cities of [[Beijing]], [[Chongqing]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Xi'an]], which had been developed in collaboration between young professional Danish architects and students and professors and students from leading universities in the four Chinese cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movingcities.org/interviews/henrik-valeur_domuschina |title= An interview with Henrik Valeur |publisher=Movingcities |accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By creating a framework for collaboration between academics and professionals representing two distinct cultures, it was hoped that the exchange of knowledge, ideas and experiences would stimulate "creativity and imagination to set the spark for new visions for sustainable urban development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Valeur|first= Henrik|title= CO-EVOLUTION: Danish/Chinese Collaboration on Sustainable Urban Development in China|publisher= Danish Architecture Centre|year= 2006|location= Copenhagen|isbn= 87-90668-61-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valeur later argued that: "As we become more and more interconnected and interdependent, human development is no longer a matter of the evolution of individual groups of people but rather a matter of the co-evolution of all people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Valeur |first=Henrik |title=[[India: the Urban Transition|India: the Urban Transition - a Case Study of Development Urbanism]] |publisher=Architectural Publisher B |year=2014 | isbn=978-87-92700-09-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--===In cosmology and astronomy===
In his book ''The Self-organizing Universe'', [[Erich Jantsch]] attributed the entire evolution of the [[cosmos]] to coevolution.
In [[astronomy]], an emerging theory proposes that [[black holes]] and [[galaxies]] develop in an interdependent way analogous to biological coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gnedin |first=Oleg Y.| display-authors=etal|title=Co-Evolution of Galactic Nuclei and Globular Cluster Systems |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/785/1/71 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=785 |issue=1 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/785/1/71 |bibcode=2014ApJ...785...71G |pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===In technology===
{{further|Software ecosystem}}

[[Computer software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] can be considered as two separate components but tied intrinsically by coevolution. Similarly, [[operating system]]s and computer [[Application software|applications]], [[web browser]]s and [[web application]]s.

All of these systems depend upon each other and advance step by step through a kind of evolutionary process. Changes in hardware, an operating system or web browser may introduce new features that are then incorporated into the corresponding applications running alongside.&lt;ref&gt;Theo D'Hondt, Kris De Volder, Kim Mens and Roel Wuyts, Co-Evolution of Object-Oriented Software Design and Implementation, TheKluwer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science, 2002, Volume 648, Part 2, 207–224 {{DOI|10.1007/978-1-4615-0883-0_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is closely related to the concept of "joint optimization" in [[sociotechnical system]]s analysis and design, where a system is understood to consist of both a "technical system" encompassing the tools and hardware used for production and maintenance, and a "social system" of relationships and procedures through which the technology is tied into the goals of the system and all the other human and organizational relationships within and outside the system. Such systems work best when the technical and social systems are deliberately developed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Cherns | first1=A. | year=1976 | title=The principles of sociotechnical design | url=| journal=Human Relations | volume=29 | issue=8 | page=8 | doi=10.1177/001872677602900806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In sociology===

Models of coevolution have been proposed for [[sociology]] and [[international political economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jessop | first1=Bob | year=2004 | title=Critical Semiotic Analysis and Critical Political Economy | journal=Critical Discourse Studies | volume=1 | issue=2 | pages=1–16 | doi=10.1080/17405900410001674506}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Norgaard]]'s 2006 book ''Development Betrayed'' proposes a "Co-Evolutionary Revisioning of the Future" of social and economic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Norgaard |first=Richard B. |title=Development Betrayed: The End of Progress and a Co-Evolutionary Revisioning of the Future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9yKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-91564-4 |pages=whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8540">'''Cranial electrotherapy stimulation''' ('''CES''') is a form of [[neurostimulation]] that delivers a small, pulsed, [[alternating current]] via electrodes on the head.&lt;ref name=Rosa2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosa|first1=MA|last2=Lisanby|first2=SH|title=Somatic treatments for mood disorders.|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=January 2012|volume=37|issue=1|pages=102–16|doi=10.1038/npp.2011.225|pmid=21976043|pmc=3238088}}&lt;/ref&gt; CES is used with the intention of treating a variety of conditions such as [[anxiety]], [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[insomnia]].&lt;ref name=Rosa2017/&gt; CES has been suggested as a possible treatment for [[headache]]s, [[fibromyalgia]], [[smoking cessation]], and opiate withdrawal,&lt;ref name=Rosa2017/&gt; but there is little evidence of effectiveness for many of these conditions and the evidence for use in acute [[depression (mood)|depression]] is not sufficient to justify it.&lt;ref name=Kavirajan/&gt;

==Medical uses==
A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine whether or not CES with alternating current is safe and effective for treating depression.&lt;ref name=Kavirajan&gt;{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Kavirajan HC, Lueck K, Chuang K |title=Alternating current cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) for depression |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=7 |issue= |pages=CD010521 |year=2014 |pmid=25000907 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010521.pub2 |quote=Rigorous clinical trial evidence is lacking on the use of cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) in acute depression. Thus, at present, there is insufficient evidence on which to base decisions for using CES in treatment of acute depression}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 systematic review found that evidence is insufficient that CES has clinically important effects on fibromyalgia, headache, neuromusculoskeletal pain, degenerative joint pain, depression, or insomnia; low-strength evidence suggests modest benefit in patients with anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name="pmid29435567"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Shekelle PG, Cook IA, Miake-Lye IM, Booth MS, Beroes JM, Mak S| title=Benefits and Harms of Cranial Electrical Stimulation for Chronic Painful Conditions, Depression, Anxiety, and Insomnia: A Systematic Review. | journal=Ann Intern Med | year= 2018 | volume= 168 | issue= 6 | pages= 414-421 | pmid=29435567 | doi=10.7326/M17-1970 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=29435567  }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Electrodes are placed on the ear lobes, maxilla-occipital junction, mastoid processes or temples.&lt;ref name =pscna&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirsch|first1=DL|last2=Nichols|first2=F|title=Cranial electrotherapy stimulation for treatment of anxiety, depression, and insomnia.|journal=The Psychiatric clinics of North America|date=March 2013|volume=36|issue=1|pages=169–76|doi=10.1016/j.psc.2013.01.006|pmid=23538086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the long history of CES, its underlying principles and mechanisms are still not clear.&lt;ref name=Rosa2017/&gt;

CES stimulation of 1 mA (milliampere) has shown to reach the thalamic area at a radius of 13.30&amp;nbsp;mm. CES has shown to induce changes in the electroencephalogram, increasing alpha relative power and decreasing relative power in delta and beta frequencies.&lt;ref name =pscna/&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=July 2016}}

CES has also shown to reach cortical and subcortical areas of the brain, in electromagnetic tomography and [[functional MRI]] studies.&lt;ref name =pscna/&gt; CES treatments have been found to induce changes in neurohormones and neurotransmitters that have been implicated in psychiatric disorders: substantial increases in beta endorphins, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, and serotonin; moderate increases in melatonin and norepinephrine, modest or unquantified increases in cholinesterase, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and dehydroepiandrosterone, and moderate reductions in cortisol.&lt;ref name =pscna/&gt;

==History==
Low intensity electrical stimulation is believed to have originated in the studies of galvanic currents in humans and animals as conducted by [[Giovanni Aldini]], [[Alessandro Volta]] and others in the 18th century. Aldini had experimented with galvanic head current as early as 1794 (upon himself) and reported the successful treatment of patients suffering from [[melancholia]] using [[Direct current|direct]] low-intensity currents in 1804.&lt;ref name=Zaghi&gt;Soroush Zaghi, Mariana Acar, Brittney  Hultgren, Paulo S. Boggio, and Felipe Fregni. "Noninvasive Brain Stimulation  with Low-Intensity Electrical Currents:  Putative Mechanisms of Action for Direct  and Alternating Current Stimulation." Neuroscientist. 2010 Jun;16(3):285-307 {{doi|10.1177/1073858409336227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CES was initially studied for insomnia and called electrosleep therapy;&lt;ref&gt;Appel, C. P. (1972). Effect of electrosleep: Review of research. Goteborg Psychology Report, 2, 1-24&lt;/ref&gt; it is also known as cranial-electro stimulation&lt;ref&gt;Iwanovsky, A., &amp; Dodge, C. H. (1968). Electrosleep and electroanesthesia–theory and
clinical experience. Foreign Science Bulletin, 4 (2), 1-64&lt;/ref&gt;  and transcranial electrotherapy.&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;Gibson TH, Donald E. O'Hair. Cranial application of low level transcranial  electrotherapy vs. relaxation instruction in anxious patients. American Journal of  Electromedicine. 1987;4(1):18-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the rise of pharmaceutical treatments for depression, anxiety and insomnia, such as [[Prozac]] in the 1980s and [[Ambien]] in the 1990s, CES was not a well-known treatment for doctors and patients. During the mid-2000s, the combination of pharmaceutical brands becoming generic and Internet advertising caused CES devices to gain popularity. In 2011, the devices received media attention from the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703779704576073762463762744|title=Using Electricity, Magnets for Mental Illness|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 11, 2011|accessdate=February 23, 2016|author=Melinda Beck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
In the United States, CES technology is classified by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) as a Class III medical device and must be dispensed by or on the order of a licensed [[Health care provider|healthcare practitioner]], i.e., a  physician, psychiatrist, nurse practitioner, psychologist, physician assistant, or occupational therapist who has an appropriate electrotherapy license, dependent upon state regulations.&lt;ref name=Medscape&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/758820 |title= Electrical Stimulators Need High-Risk Rating, Says FDA Panel |author= Shelley A |date= February 17, 2012 |accessdate= February 21, 2015 |publisher= Medscape Medical News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States requires a prescription for CES devices from a licensed healthcare practitioner. The FDA says that there are 11 CES devices cleared for marketing in the United States.&lt;ref name=FDA_CFR&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?FR=882.5800 21CFR882.5800, Part 882 ("Neurological Devices")]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/neuropsychiatry/fda-panel-votes-curtail-cranial-electrotherapy-stimulators FDA Panel Votes to Curtail Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulators], Psychiatric Times&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the FDA announced that it "has determined that there is sufficient information to establish special controls, and that these special controls, together with general controls, will provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for CES devices. In this action, FDA is withdrawing the proposed rule and proposed order to call for PMAs for CES devices. FDA plans to issue a proposed order in the future for the reclassification of the CES device into class II."&lt;ref name=FDA2014&gt;[https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/06/12/2014-13756/neurological-devices-withdrawal-of-proposed-effective-date-of-requirement-for-premarket-approval-for Neurological Devices; Withdrawal of Proposed Effective Date of Requirement for Premarket Approval for Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulator Devices], Federal Register&lt;/ref&gt;

DAVID can be found at http://david.niaid.nih.gov or http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov

The DAVID Bioinformatics Resources consists of the DAVID Knowledgebase and five integrated, web-based functional annotation tool suites: the DAVID Gene Functional Classification Tool, the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool, the DAVID Gene ID Conversion Tool, the DAVID Gene Name Viewer and the DAVID NIAID Pathogen Genome Browser. The expanded DAVID Knowledgebase now integrates almost all major and well-known public bioinformatics resources centralized by the DAVID Gene Concept, a [[single-linkage]] method to agglomerate tens of millions of diverse gene/protein identifiers and annotation terms from a variety of public bioinformatics databases. For any uploaded gene list, the DAVID Resources now provides not only the typical gene-term enrichment analysis, but also new tools and functions that allow users to condense large gene lists into gene functional groups, convert between gene/protein identifiers, visualize many-genes-to-many-terms relationships, cluster redundant and heterogeneous terms into groups, search for interesting and related genes or terms, dynamically view genes from their lists on bio-pathways and more.

DAVID 6.8 (beta) was released in May 2016.

== Functionality ==
DAVID provides a comprehensive set of functional annotation tools for investigators to understand biological meaning behind large list of genes. For any given gene list, DAVID tools are able to:
* Identify enriched biological themes, particularly [[gene ontology|GO terms]]
* Discover enriched functional-related gene groups
* Cluster redundant annotation terms
* Visualize genes on [[BioCarta]] &amp; [[KEGG]] pathway maps
* Display related many-genes-to-many-terms on 2-D view.
* Search for other functionally related genes not in the list 
* List [[protein-protein interaction|interacting proteins]]
* Explore gene names in batch 
* Link gene-disease associations 
* Highlight protein functional domains and motifs 
* Redirect to related literatures 
* Convert gene identifiers from one type to another.

'''Daniel Harold Casriel''' (March 1, 1924 &amp;ndash; June 7, 1983) was an American [[psychiatrist]], [[psychoanalyst]] and writer from [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;The New York Times; Obituary June 10, 1983, Friday Late City Final Edition, Section D, Page 19&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Casriel's method of [[group psychotherapy]] is continued today. His novel road map to happiness evolved into a framework for the field of [[relationship education]] as the [[PAIRS Foundation|PAIRS']] relationship roadmap for couples.&lt;ref name="BuildingRelationships"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeMaria|first1=Rita|title=Building Intimate Relationships|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=1135454396|pages=28-31|url=https://danielcasriel.com/2017/08/22/from-the-road-to-happiness-to-a-relationship-roadmap-for-couples/|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Casriel also founded the [[Daytop]] treatment centers.

==Early life and education==
Daniel Harold Casriel was born in New York City on 1 March, 1924.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Cincinnati]] College of Medicine in 1949 at age twenty-five. In 1950, he began his residency at the Kingsbridge Veterans' Administration Hospital in the [[Bronx]]. Eight months into his residency he was drafted by the military and sent to [[Okinawa]] where he served as an Army psychiatrist for a year and a half.&lt;ref&gt;Psychiatry In The U.S. Army: Lessons for Community Psychiatry By Albert Julius Glass, Franklin D. Jones, p.189 http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA434841&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Professional training===
Casriel was a trainee at the Columbia Psychoanalytic Institute for Training and Research between 1949 and 1953 and spent 7½ years in analysis Dr. Abram Kardiner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/kardiner-abram |title=Abram Kardiner: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |date=1981-07-20 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the founder of the first psychoanalytic institute in the United States and a former analysand of [[Sigmund Freud]]. Casriel was also a past president of the American Society of Psychoanalytic Physicians.

===Private practice===
In the winter of 1953 Casriel began private practice as a psychiatrist in New York City.  Shortly thereafter he was appointed as a psychiatric consultant to the Metropolitan Hospital in East Harlem and the Court of Special Sessions in Manhattan where he became active in the treatment drug addicts.

===Writer===
In July 1962 Casriel visited the famous [[Synanon]] therapeutic community on the US West coast. So impressed with what he saw there, he moved into the community for a “closer look” and wrote a book about the experience ( "So Fair A House: The story of Synanon"). In February 1963, Casriel gave $2000 to seven members of Synanon to start a community on the East Coast. The result was a house on Greens Farm Road, [[Westport, Connecticut]] directed by Jack Hurst, former president of Synanon in Santa Monica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jFcmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EQEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1854%2C803173 |title=Sunday Herald; Oct 6, 1963, Page 25 "Synanon Work Extolled by Mag" |publisher=News.google.com |date=1963-10-06 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consultancy===
In the summer of the same year, Casriel became the psychiatric consultant for the [[Daytop| Daytop Lodge]] project on Staten Island, a kind of half-way house for the rehabilitation of convicted felons who were addicts. Later, he became cofounder, psychiatric director and medical superintendent of Daytop Village, now one of the world’s largest therapeutic communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daytop.org/history.html |title=The History of Daytop New York In Substance Abuse Treatment |publisher=Daytop.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222234947/http://www.daytop.org/history.html |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;November 21, 1968, Vol. XIV, No. 6 Schism on 14th Street: The Daytop Explosion

===Experiments===
In the fall of 1963, Casriel, now age 39,  began experimenting with group therapy in his private practice in New York.  He began leading groups alone and with peer group leaders like  David A. Deitch, the Synanon director at Westport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/ddeitch.html |title=David Deitch, Ph.D |publisher=Psychiatry.ucsd.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229055018/http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/ddeitch.html |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972 he released his findings to the public in a book titled "A Scream Away From Happiness" where he describes [[bonding psychotherapy|The New Identity Process]], a group psychotherapy that uses screaming, hugging and affirmations of basic needs.

===Methods===
By the late 1960s, Dr Casriel had extended his private practice to include a small [[therapeutic community]] on the top four floors of his office building. This program he called AREBA, short for ''A''ccelerated ''R''e-education of The ''E''motions, ''B''ehavior and ''A''ttitudes. It consisted of about a dozen beds for young addicts who came to live, "work" and participate in the "New Identity Process". When Casriel died in 1983,  former patient [[Steven Yohay]] expanded the program and became president of AREBA Casriel, Inc.,  today the oldest surviving private addiction treatment centre in the United States.

In the late 1970s, Casriel began teaching his method in several European centers. The German psychiatrist Dr. Walther H. Lechler became one of his students and later employed the ideas extensively in the development of the Herrenalb Model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klinik-bad-herrenalb.com/en/content.php?Cont=therapie_konzept&amp;Navi=therapie |title=Celenus Kliniken - Gesundheit als Aufgabe |publisher=Klinik-bad-herrenalb.com |date=2011-12-28 |accessdate=2012-01-01 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of psychotherapy used at the hospital of the same name in South Germany. Another trainee was the Danish psychoanalyst, [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Osho]] sanyassin and mystic, Shanti Kristian Dahl-Madsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniomystica.se/meetShanti.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130418125732/http://www.uniomystica.se/meetShanti.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-18 |title=uniomystica.se/index.html |publisher=Uniomystica.se |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He incorporated the new identity process into a life-affirmative approach to spirituality he called  'Spiritual Hedonism',

Casriel's method of [[group psychotherapy]] is continued today through the efforts of the International Society of Bonding Psychotherapy which has members in 8 European cities as well as North and South America.

==Influence==

Casriel's novel concept of a "Relationship Road Map" became the foundation of [[PAIRS Foundation|PAIRS']] approach to [[relationship education]]. Expanding on [[Horace Mann]]'s focus on the pursuit of happiness as a universal human desire, Casriel theorized that the emotion of love comes from the anticipation of pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=DeMaria, Rita |title=Building Intimate Relationships |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2002 |pages= |isbn= 978-1583910764 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Casriel's theory, "bonding," which he defined as "the unique combination of emotional openness and physical closeness with another human being," is central to sustaining healthy, intimate relationships. Casriel taught that symptoms of bonding deprivation include: "illness, fatigue, depression, rigidity, constriction, isolation, and the range of anti-social behaviors such as drug and alcohol abuse, gambling and sex addictions." Casriel considered bonding a biologically-based need similar to the need for food, water, air, and shelter, yet unique as the only biologically-based need people cannot meet for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eisenberg, Seth |author2=PAIRS Foundation |title=PAIRS Essentials |publisher=PAIRS Foundation |location=Florida |year=2007 |pages=72 |isbn= 0985427817 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="casriel_web"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casriel|first1=Daniel|title=Quest for Emotional Health|url=https://danielcasriel.com/2017/08/20/quest-for-emotional-health/|website=www.danielcasriel.com|publisher=Purpose Built Families Foundation|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Casriel died at his home in Manhattan on 7 June 1983 age 59 from a form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ([[ALS]]). He is survived by his wife, the former Olivia Cohen; two sons, Seth, a film editor and producer,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0143885/&lt;/ref&gt; and Lyle, a financial adviser.&lt;ref&gt;https://financialservicesinc.ubs.com/fa/lylecasriel/{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Earth Charter Initiative''' is the collective name for the global network of people, organizations, and institutions who participate in promoting the [[Earth Charter]], and in implementing its principles in practice. The Initiative is a broad-based, voluntary, [[civil society]] effort, but participants include leading international institutions, national government agencies, university associations, [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, cities, faith groups, and many well-known leaders in [[sustainable development]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== Mission and goals ==
The stated mission of the Earth Charter Initiative is to promote the transition to sustainable ways of living and a global society founded on a shared ethical framework that includes respect and care for the community of life, [[Ecological health|ecological integrity]], universal [[human rights]], [[Respect diversity|respect for diversity]], economic justice, [[democracy]], and a culture of [[peace]].

===Goals===
#To raise awareness worldwide of the Earth Charter and to promote understanding of its inclusive ethical vision.  
#To seek recognition and endorsement of the Earth Charter by individuals, organizations, and the [[United Nations]].
#To promote the use of the Earth Charter as an ethical guide and the implementation of its principles by civil society, business, and government.  
#To encourage and support the educational use of the Earth Charter in schools, universities, religious communities, local communities, and many other settings.  
#To promote recognition and use of the Earth Charter as a [[soft law]] document.

===Strategic objectives===
* To promote development of a global network of Earth Charter supporters and activists with the collaboration of advisors, affiliates, partner organizations, and task forces.
* To create and disseminate high quality communications and educational materials to different target groups that will reach millions of people.
* To translate key Earth Charter materials in all major languages of the world.
* To set up Earth Charter websites in all countries in partnership with key individuals and organizations.
* To promote the Earth Charter vision in key local, national and international events and engage individuals and organizations in applying it in their areas of activity.
* To position the Earth Charter in relation to important international initiatives and processes so that its ethical framework can be used as a guide in efforts to address urgent challenges such as climate change, [[biodiversity loss]], the [[Millennium Development Goals]], [[food security]], and [[conflict resolution]].
* To undertake training programmes to facilitate the uptake and application of the Earth Charter in different sectors.
* To develop the guidance and instruments to help organizations, businesses, and local communities use the Earth Charter to assess progress toward sustainable development.

== Organization ==
A formal network of affiliates, partners, and youth groups helps to promote the Earth Charter around the world. Many of these representatives are based in prominent national-level organizations and institutions.

The Initiative is served and coordinated by [[Earth Charter International]], which is composed by an Executive Office called the ECI Secretariat, and by the ECI Council.  The Secretariat is composed by a very small staff, and it is based at [[University for Peace|the University for Peace]] campus in [[San José, Costa Rica]]. The Council is equivalent to a Board, they meet once a year and provide strategic guidance to the Secretariat and the EC Initiative.

== Earth Charter Youth Program ==
The Earth Charter Youth program is a network of youth NGOs and young activists who share a common interest in sustainable development and the Earth Charter. [[Severn Cullis-Suzuki]] from Vancouver, Canada was nominated as [[youth]] representative in the Earth Charter Commission, which oversaw the drafting process. At the age of 17, Severn participated in the Earth Summit of 1997 and made sure that concerns of young people were taken seriously in the process of drafting the Earth Charter. She contributed to the inclusion of principle 12c in the final version of the Earth Charter which stresses the need to: “Honor and support the young people of our communities, enabling them to fulfill their essential role in creating sustainable societies.” The launch of the Earth Charter Youth program was inspired by this ethical principle. Today there are two youth representatives on the Earth Charter International Council.

The '''Electric Power Research Institute''', Inc. or '''EPRI''', is an American independent, [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] organization that conducts research and development related to the [[Electricity generation|generation]], delivery, and use of [[electricity]] to help address challenges in electricity, including reliability, efficiency, affordability, health, safety, and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epri.com/#/about/epri?lang=en|title=EPRI Public Site|website=www.epri.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPRI's principal offices and laboratories are located in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], California; [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], N.C.; [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], TN; and [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]], MA.

==History==
In November 1965, the [[Northeast blackout of 1965|Great Northeastern Blackout]] left 30 million people in the United States without electricity. Historic in scale and impact, it demonstrated the nation's growing dependence upon electricity and its vulnerability to power loss. The event marked a watershed moment for the U.S. [[Electricity sector of the United States|electricity sector]] and triggered the creation of the Electric Power Research Institute.

Following the blackout, leaders in [[United States Congress|Congress]] held hearings in the early 1970s about the lack of research supporting the power industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/CorporateDocuments/EPRI_Journal/2012-Summer/1025689_Blackout.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819152610/http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/CorporateDocuments/EPRI_Journal/2012-Summer/1025689_Blackout.pdf |archivedate=2016-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Chauncey Starr, then the Dean of the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] [[UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science]], led the initiative, proposed by Congress, to create an independent research and development organization to support the electricity sector and address its technical and operational challenges. In 1972, at a formal hearing of the [[U.S. Senate Commerce Committee]], Starr presented a vision for the Electric Power Research Institute to serve Congress's mandate for objective, scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Brent|date=Summer 2012|title=Born in a Blackout|url=http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/CorporateDocuments/EPRI_Journal/2012-Summer/1025689_Blackout.pdf|journal=EPRI Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr served as the first President of EPRI for five years and formally retired at age 65, but continued to work at EPRI for the next 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Brent|date=Spring 2012|title=The Man Who Never Stopped|url=http://eprijournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1025049_Spring_online.pdf|journal=EPRI Journal|volume=1|pages=14–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7346">The '''Energy Technologies Institute''' ('''ETI''') is an energy research, development and demonstration body established in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2007. The government set up the ETI following an announcement in the 2006 budget speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_06/bud_bud06_speech.cfm Budget 2006: Speech&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925193953/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_06/bud_bud06_speech.cfm |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the ETI is to “accelerate the development, demonstration and eventual commercial deployment of a focused portfolio of energy technologies, which will increase energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help achieve energy and climate change goals”. The institute works with a range of academic and commercial bodies.

Deployment of the technologies involved, which are expected to contribute to the reduction of the UK’s [[carbon emissions]], is expected to begin around 2018.

Commentators generally welcomed the new body as likely to make a positive contribution in the efforts to minimise [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/press_releases/06-03-22_budget.htm Science Media Centre -press releases archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070313163433/http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/press_releases/06-03-22_budget.htm |date=2007-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, they pointed to the slow pace of government action in promoting [[energy conservation]] and implementing existing low-carbon technologies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grownupgreen.org.uk/library/?id=877&amp;PHPSESSID=e324f44440ed07bb6459a8cd5f3a35f7 Was Brown's Budget Green? - grownupgreen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  compared to progress in a number of other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/renewable/Story/0,,201987,00.html Renewable energy across Europe | Special reports | Guardian Unlimited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
In addition to initial funding for the ETI, the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform|Department for Business]] will provide £50 million a year over a period of 10 years starting in 2008-09. When establishing the ETI, the government expected the separate Energy Research Partnership &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070311040609/http://www.energyresearchpartnership.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; to raise matching funding from commercial organisations.

As of September 2006 [[EDF Energy]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[BP]] and [[E.ON UK]] had committed to providing funds. By 2014, this had grown to include [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] and [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls-Royce]].

==Objectives==
Five objectives were set for the institute:
*To increase the level of research and development funding to meet the [[Energy policy of the United Kingdom|UK’s energy policy goals]].
*To deliver research and development that facilitates the rapid commercial deployment of cost-effective, low-carbon energy technologies.
*To provide better strategic focus for commercially applicable energy related research and development in the UK.
*To connect and manage networks of the best scientists and engineers to deliver focussed energy research and development projects to accelerate eventual commercial deployment.
*To build research and development capacity in the UK in the relevant technical disciplines to deliver the UK’s energy policy goals.

The ETI describes as its vision: "Affordable, secure, sustainable energy for present and future generations."

==Research focus==
The institute set out to focus research on a mixture of technologies.

As of 2014, the ETI states&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eti.co.uk/about/how_we_operate/types_of_projects/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427185929/http://www.eti.co.uk/about/how_we_operate/types_of_projects/#sthash.H71ADUdd.dpuf |archive-date=2014-04-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that typically it supports projects that:

* Develop and demonstrate system level capabilities based on novel low carbon energy technologies or services
* Create additional value through the capabilities of the ETI Industry Members and Project Partners
* Create new partnerships - improving skills, knowledge, capabilities and supply chain capacity
* Create benefit in the UK and globally - through deployment, skills, knowledge base or exports
* Reduce risk associated with novel energy systems and supply chains
* Identify barriers requiring “next generation” science and technology support
* Inform development of regulations, standards, and policy

At the same time, the institute focuses on a mix of technologies to increase security of supply, and solutions to address [[fuel poverty]].

In 2017 the ETI started the Nuclear Cost Drivers Project, which aims to identify cost reductions in nuclear power plant design, construction and operation, so enabling more widespread deployment of new nuclear.&lt;ref name=wnn-20171027&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-UK-study-aims-to-identify-nuclear-cost-reductions-2710174.html |title=UK study aims to identify nuclear cost reductions |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=27 October 2017 |accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Historically, since the privatisation of the country's energy industries, public sector support for energy research and development in the UK has come from a variety of bodies with little co-ordination between them. Problems experienced as a result of this included poor continuity of funding, and the availability of funding for certain parts of the research-development-commercialisation process but not others. Funding levels have also been low by international standards.

==Location==

In September 2007 it was announced that the Midlands Consortium had been chosen to host the ETI. The consortium comprises the Universities of Birmingham, Loughborough and Nottingham with financial support from Advantage West Midlands and the East Midlands Development Agency. 
The hub of the ETI is based at [[Loughborough University]], on the Holywell Park area of the campus, at the heart of the University's Science and Enterprise Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscentre.bham.ac.uk/press/2007/09/ETI_consortium_bid_20_09_07.shtml ETI Bid Press Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In molecular biology, the '''FAD dependent oxidoreductase family''' of proteins is a family of [[flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]] dependent [[oxidoreductases]]. Members of this family include [[Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase]] {{EC number|1.1.99.5}}, [[Sarcosine oxidase]] beta subunit {{EC number|1.5.3.1}}, [[D-amino-acid dehydrogenase]] {{EC number|1.4.99.1}}, [[D-aspartate oxidase]] {{EC number|1.4.3.1}}.

[[D-amino acid oxidase]] {{EC number|1.4.3.3}} (DAMOX or DAO) is an FAD flavoenzyme that [[Catalysis|catalyses]] the [[redox|oxidation]] of neutral and basic D-[[amino acids]] into their corresponding keto acids. DAOs have been characterised and [[sequenced]] in [[fungus|fungi]] and [[vertebrates]] where they are known to be located in the [[peroxisomes]].

'''The Sir [[James George Frazer]] Memorial Lectureship in [[Social Anthropology]]''' is a British academic lecture series.

In 1920 a sum of £675 was raised by a Committee of the University of Cambridge for the purpose of commemorating Sir James Frazer’s contributions to learning. In accordance with the wishes of the subscribers, a Frazer Lectureship in Anthropology was founded, the annual income of the fund being assigned to the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], [[University of Glasgow]] and [[University of Liverpool]] in rotation for this purpose.

The nitrogen-15 dimension is perpendicular to the screen. Each window is focused on the nitrogen chemical shift of that amino acid. The sequential assignment is made by matching the alpha carbon chemical shifts.]]
'''HNCA''' is a 3D [[Triple-resonance nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|triple-resonance]] [[NMR]] experiment commonly used in the field of [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|protein NMR]]. The name derives from the experiment's magnetization transfer pathway: The magnetization of the amide proton of an [[Amino acid|amino acid residue]] is transferred to the amide nitrogen, and then to the alpha carbons of both the starting residue and the previous residue in the protein's amino acid sequence. In contrast, the complementary [[HNCOCA]] experiment
transfers magnetization only to the alpha carbon of the previous residue{{ref|hnca}}. The HNCA experiment is used, often in tandem with HNCOCA, to assign alpha carbon resonance signals to specific residues in the protein. This experiment requires a purified sample of protein prepared with [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[Nitrogen-15|&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]] [[Isotopic labeling|isotopic labelling]], at a concentration greater than 0.1 [[Concentration#Molarity|mM]], and is thus generally only applied to [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant proteins]].

The spectrum produced by this experiment has 3 dimensions: A proton axis, a &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N axis and a &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C axis. For residue i peaks will appear at {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;alpha&lt;/sub&gt; (i)} and {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;alpha&lt;/sub&gt;(i-1)}, while for the complementary [[HNCOCA]] experiment peaks appear only at {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;alpha&lt;/sub&gt;(i-1)}. Together, these two experiments reveal the alpha carbon chemical shift for each amino acid residue in a protein, and provide information linking adjacent residues in the protein's sequence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12321">A '''hypercompact stellar system''' ('''HCSS''') is a dense [[star cluster|cluster of stars]] around a [[supermassive black hole]] that has been ejected from the center of its host [[galaxy]]. Stars that are close to the black hole at the time of the ejection will remain bound to the black hole after it leaves the galaxy, forming the HCSS.

The term "hypercompact" refers to the fact HCSSs are small in size compared with ordinary star clusters of similar [[luminosity]]. This is because the gravitational force from the supermassive black hole keeps the stars moving in very tight orbits about the center of the cluster.

The luminous X-ray source SDSS 1113 near the galaxy [[Markarian 177]] would be the first candidate for an HCSS. Finding an HCSS would confirm the theory of [[binary black hole#Black-hole merger recoil|gravitational wave recoil]], and would prove that supermassive black holes can exist outside galaxies.

==Properties==
Astronomers believe that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be ejected from the centers of galaxies by gravitational wave recoil. This happens when two SMBHs in a binary system coalesce, after losing energy in the form of [[gravitational wave]]s. Because the gravitational waves are not emitted [[isotropic]]ally, some [[momentum]] is imparted to the coalescing black holes, and they feel a recoil, or "kick," at the moment of coalescence. [[Numerical relativity|Computer simulations]] suggest that the kick can be as large as &lt;math&gt;10^5 km/s&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Healy09"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

Stars that are orbiting around the SMBH at the moment of the kick will be dragged along with the SMBH, providing their orbital velocity exceeds the kick velocity {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. This is what determines the size of the HCSS: its radius is roughly the radius of the orbit that has the same velocity around the SMBH as the kick velocity, or

:&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{GM}{V_k^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''M''}} is the [[mass]] of the SMBH and {{math|''G''}} the [[gravitational constant]]. The size {{math|''R''}} works out to be roughly one-half [[parsec]] (pc) (two [[light year]]s) for a kick of 1000&amp;nbsp;km/s and a SMBH mass of 100 million [[solar mass]]es. The largest HCSSs would have sizes of about 20&amp;nbsp;pc, roughly the same as a large [[globular cluster]], and the smallest would be about a thousandth of a parsec across, smaller than any known star cluster.&lt;ref name="MSK09"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of stars that remain bound to the SMBH after the kick depends both on {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and on how densely the stars were clustered about the SMBH before the kick. A number of arguments suggest that the total stellar mass would be roughly 0.1% of the mass of the SMBH or less.&lt;ref name=MSK09/&gt; The biggest HCSSs would carry perhaps a few million stars, making them comparable in luminosity to a [[globular cluster]] or [[Dwarf galaxy#Ultra Compact Dwarfs|ultra-compact dwarf galaxy]].

Aside from being very compact, the main difference between an HCSS and an ordinary star cluster is the much greater mass of the HCSS, due to the SMBH at its centre. The SMBH itself is dark and undetectable, but its gravity causes the stars to move at much higher velocities than in an ordinary star cluster. Normal star clusters have internal velocities of a few kilometers per second, while in an HCSS, essentially all the stars are moving faster than {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, i.e. hundreds or thousands of kilometers per second.

If the kick velocity is less than the [[escape velocity]] from the galaxy, the SMBH will fall back toward the galaxy nucleus, oscillating many times through the galaxy before finally coming to rest.&lt;ref name="GM08"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the HCSS would only exist as a distinct object for a relatively short time, of order hundreds of millions of years, before disappearing back into the galaxy nucleus. During this time the HCSS would be difficult to detect since it would be superposed on or behind the galaxy.

Even if an HCSS escapes from its host galaxy, it will remain bound to the [[galaxy group|group]] or [[galaxy cluster|cluster]] that contains the galaxy, since the escape velocity from a cluster of galaxies is much larger than that from a single galaxy. When observed, the HCSS will be moving more slowly than {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, since it will have climbed out through the gravitational [[potential well]] of the galaxy and/or cluster.

The stars in an HCSS would be similar to the types of stars that are observed in galactic nuclei. This would make the stars in an HCSS more [[stellar metallicity|metal-rich]] and younger than the stars in a typical globular cluster.&lt;ref name=MSK09/&gt;

==Search==
Since the black hole at the center of the HCSS is essentially invisible, an HCSS would look very similar to a faint cluster of stars (see figure). Determining that an observed star cluster is a HCSS requires measuring the orbital velocities of the stars in the cluster via their [[Doppler shift]]s and verifying that they are moving much faster than expected for stars in an ordinary star cluster. This is a challenging observation to make because an HCSS would be relatively faint, requiring many hours of exposure time even on a [[List of largest optical reflecting telescopes|10m&amp;nbsp;class]] telescope.

The most promising places to look for HCSSs are [[galaxy cluster|cluster of galaxies]], for two reasons: first, most of the galaxies in a galaxy cluster are [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] which are believed to have formed through [[galaxy merger|mergers]]. A galaxy merger is a prerequisite for forming a binary SMBH, which is a prerequisite for a kick. Second, the escape velocity from a galaxy cluster is large enough that a HCSS would be retained even if it escaped from its host galaxy.

It has been estimated that the nearby [[Fornax cluster|Fornax]] and [[Virgo cluster|Virgo]] galaxy clusters may contain hundreds or thousands of HCSSs.&lt;ref name=MSK09/&gt; These galaxy clusters have been surveyed for compact galaxies and star clusters. It is possible that some of the objects picked up in these surveys were HCSSs that were misidentified as ordinary star clusters. A few of the compact objects in the surveys are known to have rather high internal velocities, but none appear to be massive enough to qualify as HCSSs.&lt;ref name="Mieske08"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

Another likely place to find a HCSS would be near the site of a recent [[galaxy merger]].

From time to time, the black hole at the center of an HCSS will disrupt a star that passes too close, producing a very luminous flare. A few such flares have been observed at the ''centers'' of galaxies, presumably caused by a star coming too close to the SMBH in the galaxy nucleus.&lt;ref name="Komossa04"&gt;{{Citation| first = S.

&lt;/ref&gt; Since the lifetime of a flare is a few months, the chances of seeing such an event are small unless a large volume of space is surveyed. A star in a HCSS could also explode as a [[Supernova#Type I|Type I]] ([[white dwarf]]) [[supernova]].&lt;ref name=KM08/&gt;

==Importance==
Discovery of an HCSS would be important for several reasons.

* It would constitute proof that supermassive black holes can exist outside galaxies.
* It would verify the [[numerical relativity#Recent developments|computer simulations]] that predict gravitational wave recoils of thousands of kilometers per second.
* Existence of HCSSs would imply that some galaxies do not have supermassive black holes at their centers. This would have important consequences for theories that link the growth of galaxies to the growth of supermassive black holes, and for [[M-sigma relation|empirical correlations]] between SMBH mass and galaxy properties.
* If many HCSSs could be discovered, it would be possible to reconstruct the [[probability distribution|distribution]] of kick velocities, which contains information about the merger history of galaxies, the masses and [[spin (physics)|spin]]s of binary black holes, etc.

The '''International Center for East Asian Archaeology and Cultural History''' (abbreviated '''ICEAACH''', simplified Chinese: 东亚考古与文化历史国际研究中心; traditional Chinese: 東亞考古與文化歷史國際研究中心; pinyin: dōng yà kǎo gǔ yǔ wén huà lì shǐ guó jì yán jiū zhōng xīn) is an internationally recognized hub for [[Transdisciplinarity|trans-disciplinary]] research and [[public outreach]] in [[East Asian archaeology]] and [[East Asian culture|cultural]] heritage. As part of [[Boston University]]’s Department of Archaeology, the primary mission of ICEAACH is to advance the field of [[East Asia]]n archaeology and promote knowledge and understanding of East Asia’s rich cultural heritage.

== History ==
The International Center for East Asian Archaeology and Cultural History (ICEAACH) was established as part of Boston University’s Department of Archaeology in 1999 with a grant from the [[Henry Luce scholar|Henry Luce Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/about/ |title=About ICEAACH » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding, ICEAACH has come to occupy a unique position in our field as a [[research institution]] specifically dedicated to promoting East Asian archaeology and cultural heritage. ICEAACH’s facilities, such as a major East Asian archaeology library, experts staff—paired with the resources of the Department of Archaeology, and home to one of the largest archaeology programs in the US—affords students, researchers, and the public opportunities found nowhere else in the United States. With strong ties to leading research institutions across East and Southeast Asia, ICEAACH has become an important [[collaborative hub]] for Western archaeologists pursuing East Asian research, and for East and Southeast Asian scholars and institutions seeking Western resources and expertise, broadening understanding of Asia’s place in [[history of humanity|human history]]. ICEAACH's unique position helps [[archaeologist]]s from around the globe transcend the cultural, political, and organizational barriers that have traditionally hindered research in East Asian archaeology.

== Programs in ICEAACH ==
With support from Boston University, numerous foundations, and a growing group of dedicated private donors, ICEAACH provides a wide range of important resources and programs, including:
* A publicly accessible research library with over 10,000 volumes on East and Southeast Asian archaeology and related fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/library/ |title=The ICEAACH Library » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] programs on Asian archaeology in Boston University’s Department of Archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/archaeology/academics/ |title=Academics &amp;#124; Archaeology Department |publisher=Bu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* International research programs, ranging from the emergence of [[agriculture in East Asia]], [[climate change]] and its impact on [[hunter-gatherer]] populations in East Asia, [[ethnicity]] and state formation, and the development of [[bronze metallurgy]] to archaeological applications of remote sensing, [[paleoethnobotanical]] research, the Southeast Asian maritime trade, and heritage management and antiquities legislation.
* [[Survey (archaeology)|Archaeological fieldwork]] across eastern Asia. ICEAACH staff have excavated a 20,000-year-old cave in China with the world’s oldest pottery, and are searching for sites on the [[Yangzi River]] of the first [[rice farmer]]s. The ICEAACH is home to a project exploring the roots of the [[Shang Dynasty]] on the great flood plain of the [[Yellow River]], and discovering the lost Bronze Age [[Sanxingdui|city of Song]]. ICEAACH students have done fieldwork in [[Japan]], [[Mongolia]], [[China]], [[Cambodia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/projects/ |title=Research » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ARC/Base bibliographic database project: ICEAACH is advancing research across the field through our development of the international, collaborative ARC/Base, a new comprehensive, web-based, [[multilingual]] [[bibliographic database]] of Asian archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/projects/arcbase/ |title=The ARC/Base Project » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scholarly communication and the broad dissemination of research results through publications, conferences, and lectures, including the East Asian Archaeology Forum seminar series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/news/east-asian-archaeology-forum-eaaf-lecture-series/ |title=East Asian Archaeology Forum (EAAF) Lecture Series » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Visiting Scholar programs: ICEAACH hosts leading researchers and graduate students from across Asia who come to the center for long- and short-term stays. ICEAACH library facilities and the strength of our department in [[cultural heritage]] management are major draws, as are collaborations with ICEAACH staff and other Archaeology Department faculty and students.
* [[Public outreach]] programs serving a wide range of museum educators, K-12 school teachers, members of the media, and other groups to promote education and awareness about East Asia’s archaeology and cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/library/educational-resources/ |title=Educational Resources » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Book and Journal Exchange Program: ICEAACH sends thousands of books and journals on Western archaeology and related fields to academic institutions across Asia who do not have the resources to acquire such items themselves. We also receive in exchange research materials that are difficult to find elsewhere outside of Asia.

'''''Landscape''''' was a magazine of human geography founded by [[J.B. Jackson]] in 1951 and published three times a year in [[Berkeley, California]] until 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard University Library [http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/000113983/catalog  catalog entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine's original subtitle was "Human Geography of the Southwest"; this was later dropped.

The first five issues consisted largely of Jackson's own essays. Jackson was the magazine's publisher and editor until 1968. Publication was suspended from 1971–1974.

Its ISSN was 0023-8023.

'''Lexicography''' is divided into two separate but equally important groups:

* '''Practical lexicography''' is the art or [[craft]] of compiling, writing and editing [[dictionary|dictionaries]].
* '''Theoretical lexicography''' is the [[academic disciplines|scholarly discipline]] of analyzing and describing the [[semantic]], [[syntagma (linguistics)|syntagmatic]] and [[paradigm]]atic relationships within the [[lexicon]] (vocabulary) of a [[language]], developing theories of dictionary components and structures linking the data in dictionaries, the needs for information by users in specific types of situations, and how users may best access the data incorporated in printed and electronic dictionaries. This is sometimes referred to as 'metalexicography'.

There is some disagreement on the definition of [[lexicology]], as distinct from lexicography. Some use "lexicology" as a synonym for theoretical lexicography; others use it to mean a branch of [[linguistics]] pertaining to the inventory of words in a particular language.

A person devoted to lexicography is called a '''lexicographer'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/lexicographer|title=Lexicographer job profile {{!}} Prospects.ac.uk|website=www.prospects.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Focus ==
General lexicography focuses on the design, compilation, use and evaluation of general dictionaries, i.e. dictionaries that provide a description of the language in general use. Such a dictionary is usually called a general dictionary or LGP dictionary (Language for General Purpose). Specialized lexicography focuses on the design, compilation, use and evaluation of specialized dictionaries, i.e. dictionaries that are devoted to a (relatively restricted) set of linguistic and factual elements of one or more specialist subject fields, e.g. [[legal lexicography]]. Such a dictionary is usually called a [[specialized dictionary]] or [[Language for specific purposes dictionary]] and following Nielsen 1994, specialized dictionaries are either multi-field, single-field or sub-field dictionaries.

It is now widely accepted that lexicography is a scholarly discipline in its own right and not a sub-branch of [[applied linguistics]], as the chief object of study in lexicography is the dictionary (see e.g. Bergenholtz/Nielsen/Tarp 2009).

==Etymology==

Coined in English 1680, the word "lexicography" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] λεξικογράφος ''lexikographos'', "lexicographer",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlecikogra%2Ffos λεξικογράφος],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; from λεξικόν ''lexicon'', neut. of λεξικός ''lexikos'', "of or for words",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlecikos λεξικός],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; from λέξις ''lexis'', "speech", "word",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fcis λέξις], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; (in turn from λέγω ''lego'', "to say", "to speak"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fgw3 λέγω],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;) and γράφω ''grapho'', "to scratch, to inscribe, to write".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dgra%2Ffw γράφω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==
Practical lexicographic work involves several activities, and the compilation of well-crafted dictionaries requires careful consideration of all or some of the following aspects:
* profiling the intended users (i.e. linguistic and non-linguistic competences) and identifying their needs
* defining the communicative and cognitive functions of the dictionary
* selecting and organizing the components of the dictionary
* choosing the appropriate structures for presenting the data in the dictionary (i.e. frame structure, distribution structure, macro-structure, micro-structure and [[cross-reference]] structure)
* selecting words and affixes for systematization as entries
* selecting [[collocation]]s, phrases and examples
* choosing [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]] forms for each word or part of word to be lemmatized
* defining words
* organizing definitions
* specifying pronunciations of words
* labeling definitions and pronunciations for [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] and dialect, where appropriate
* selecting equivalents in bi- and multi-lingual dictionaries
* translating collocations, phrases and examples in bi- and multilingual dictionaries
* designing the best way in which users can access the data in printed and electronic dictionaries

One important goal of lexicography is to keep the [[lexicographic information cost]]s incurred by dictionary users as low as possible. Nielsen (2008) suggests relevant aspects for lexicographers to consider when making dictionaries as they all affect the users' impression and actual use of specific dictionaries.

Theoretical lexicography concerns the same aspects as lexicography, but aims to develop principles that can improve the quality of future dictionaries, for instance in terms of access to data and lexicographic information costs. Several perspectives or branches of such academic dictionary research have been distinguished: 'dictionary criticism' (or evaluating the quality of one or more dictionaries, e.g. by means of reviews (see Nielsen 1999)), 'dictionary history' (or tracing the traditions of a type of dictionary or of lexicography in a particular country or language), 'dictionary typology' (or classifying the various genres of reference works, such as dictionary versus encyclopedia, monolingual versus bilingual dictionary, general versus technical or pedagogical dictionary), 'dictionary structure' (or formatting the various ways in which the information is presented in a dictionary), 'dictionary use' (or observing the reference acts and skills of dictionary users), and 'dictionary IT' (or applying [[Dictionary writing system|computer aids]] to the process of dictionary compilation).

One important consideration is the status of 'bilingual lexicography', or the compilation and use of the [[bilingual dictionary]] in all its aspects (see e.g. Nielsen 1894). In spite of a relatively long history of this type of dictionary, it is often said{{according to whom|date=September 2015}} to be less developed in a number of respects than its unilingual counterpart, especially in cases where one of the languages involved is not a major language. Not all genres of reference works are available in interlingual versions, e.g. LSP, learners' and encyclopedic types, although sometimes these challenges produce new subtypes, e.g. 'semi-bilingual' or 'bilingualised' dictionaries such as Hornby's ''(Oxford) Advanced Learner's Dictionary English-Chinese'', which have been developed by translating existing monolingual dictionaries (see Marello 1998).

Her book, ''Passionate Journeys: Why Successful Women Joined a Cult,'' describes [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]]’s communal city in central Oregon and the high-achieving women and men who followed him there. The book revolves around composite lives of four women—a rich housewife, a feminist community social worker, and a high fashion model—who gave up their high powered careers to follow Rajneesh.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Marion (1999). ''Passionate Journeys: Why Successful Women Joined a Cult''. University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|0472088440}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
She has also co-edited two books, written numerous scholarly articles and chapters, and served on the editorial boards of ''Sociology of Religion'' and the ''[[Journal of Religion and Violence]].''

Goldman has been featured on a number of television programs, notably the History Channel’s ''[[Wild West Tech]]'' series with [[Keith Carradine]], where she talked about prostitution on the mining frontier and its parallels in contemporary life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0854075/fullcredits "Wild West Tech" Brothel Tech (2004) - Full cast and crew&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

She has observed small cultures ranging from religious communes to brothels and looked at how they affect and often change their host societies. She has consulted with [[COYOTE]], an activist sex workers’ group, and the Information Network Focus on New Religious Movements ([[INFORM]]) in the United Kingdom.

A '''needle drop''' is a version of a music [[album]] that has been transferred from a [[vinyl record]] to [[digital audio]] or other formats. Needle drops are sometimes traded among music collectors, especially when the original vinyl recording has not been released officially on a subsequent consumer format. It is also referred to as a ''''Vinyl Rip'''' or ''''Record Rip''''

Other reasons for trading needle drops include the lack of availability of certain [[Sound recording|recordings]] on [[digital media]], the non-availability of less [[Dynamic range compression|compressed]] versions in digital form, or the lack of availability of certain versions or [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixes]] of that [[Sound recording|record]], e.g. [[Monaural|mono]] or [[stereo]] versions, or the loss of the [[master tape]].&lt;ref name="Label vault problems"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.billholland.net/words/Labels%20Strive%20to%20Rectify%20Past%20Archival%20Problems.pdf |title=Labels strive to rectify past problems |accessdate=November 5, 2008 |work=[[Billboard Magazine]] |year=2007 |author=Bill Holland |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is thought to have been coined in 1949 by [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] during the first rush of transfers of lacquer and [[Gramophone record#78 rpm disc developments|78 RPM records]] to the then-new long playing [[Gramophone record#New sizes and materials|33 ⅓ RPM format]].

The procedure is often done because [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] of the entire body is not yet available. Vitrification essentially eliminates the mechanical and chemical damage caused by ice formation,&lt;ref name="FahyWowk2015"&gt;

Meryman et al. independently reported in the same year that toxic effects of methanol, ethanol, and ammonium acetate in the frozen state are also detectable in thawed erythrocytes [46]. These non-nucleated cells did not show injury attributable to glycerol or Me2SO in the latter experiments, but evidence continued to emerge in support of putatively toxic effects of cryoprotectants during freezing [2,10,12,14,28], including such effects even in glycerolized erythrocytes [47,50,53], and by 1986 the overall evidence had become quite strong [17].}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the cost of [[Cryoprotectant#Toxicity|cryoprotectant toxicity]] and side effects of [[Desiccation|dehydration]] of tissue due to the [[blood–brain barrier]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not a direct consequence of vitrification, storage of the vitrified brain directly in liquid nitrogen raises the further aspect of fractures,&lt;ref name=alcorfaq02&gt;http://www.alcor.org/FAQs/faq02.html&lt;/ref&gt; which are fewer in number but larger in scale in vitrified tissue than frozen tissue, a consequence of cooling from ''[[Glass transition|T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;]]'' (-135&amp;nbsp;°C) to liquid nitrogen's boiling point (-196&amp;nbsp;°C).

==Advantages==
Neuropreservation has several advantages over whole body preservation. It costs less; neuropatients are easier to transport in case of legal, social, or physical problems; it is possible to do a better job of perfusing and therefore cryoprotecting the brain when there is no need to consider other tissues, and its smaller volume allows more rapid and less expensive cooling.&lt;ref name="neuropreservation option" /&gt; [[Aubrey de Grey]] has theorized that neuropatients will be revived after procedures have been perfected on whole body patients, and, therefore, have better chances for revival.&lt;ref name="daily mail"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Neuropreservation was first proposed in 1965 by cryonics co-creator Evan Cooper, proposed again in a speculative scientific paper by [[Gerontology|gerontologist]] George M. Martin in 1971, and independently proposed yet again in 1974 by [[Mike Darwin]], and [[Fred and Linda Chamberlain]].  The Chamberlains were the founders of the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]].  In 1976 Fred’s father became the first of many neuropreservation patients at Alcor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Chamberlain | first=Fred &amp; Linda | title=FRC Jr. |  publisher=Lifepact   | date=July 16, 2006 | url=http://www.lifepact.com/frcjr.htm  | access-date=2008-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the year 2000, neuropreservation was performed by surgical separation of the body from the head (called [[Head|cephalic]] isolation or "neuroseparation") at the end of [[cryoprotectant]] [[perfusion]] performed on the upper body via the ascending [[aorta]].&lt;ref name="neuropreservation option" /&gt;  After that year, Alcor began performing cephalic isolation before cryoprotectant perfusion, in deep [[hypothermia]], and then using the carotid and vetebral arteries directly for perfusion with cryoprotectants.

{{As of|2014}}, Alcor, Oregon Cryonics, and [[KrioRus]] are the only cryonics organizations that offer neuropreservation. Other organizations, such as the other major provider, [[Cryonics Institute]], avoid it because they are concerned about neuropreservation's negative effect on the public’s perception of cryonics and, especially, because of the adverse effect on the families of patients. Journalists and horror novelists invariably have a field day with "frozen severed heads", and focus not on the scientific or humanitarian purposes of cryonics, but on sensationalizing cryonics as grotesque or ridiculous. Their policy to always preserve the entire body prevents anyone leveling those claims at Cryonics Institute. Their goal is to preserve and eventually revive people, so they avoid processes like neurocryopreservation that could damage or otherwise put their patients at risk. Alcor claims there are good technical justifications for neuropreservation, and that they will continue to offer it.  Approximately three-quarters of the cryonics patients stored at Alcor are neuropatients.

The '''New Bach Edition''' (NBE), in [[German language|German]] '''Neue Bach-Ausgabe''' (NBA), is the second complete edition of the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], published by [[Bärenreiter]]. The name is short for Johann Sebastian Bach: New Edition of the Complete Works (Johann Sebastian Bach: Neue Ausgabe sämtlicher Werke). It is a historical-critical edition (German: ''historisch-kritische Ausgabe'') of Bach's complete works by the [[Johann Sebastian Bach Institute]] (Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Institut) in Göttingen and the [[Bach Archive]] (Bach-Archiv) in Leipzig,

When Bach died most of his work was unpublished. The first complete edition of Bach's music was published in the second half of the nineteenth century by the [[Bach Gesellschaft]] ([[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]], BGA). The second complete edition includes some discoveries made since 1900, but there are relatively few such scores.  The significance of the NBE lies more in its incorporation of the latest scholarship.&lt;ref name="musiclibrary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53519953.html | title=Joahann Sebastian Bach: Ratswahlkantaten, II.(Review) | publisher=[[Music Library Association]]  via [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required) | work=[[Notes (journal)|Notes]] | date=1998 | accessdate=September 26, 2012 | author=Melamed, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the NBE is an [[urtext edition]] rather than a facsimile edition, it includes many facsimiles of Bach manuscripts. 

==History==

In 1950, the commemorations of the bicentennial of Bach's death in [[Göttingen]] and [[Leipzig]] led to the initiative to publish his complete works in a critical scientific edition. Musicologists such as [[Friedrich Blume]], Max Schneider, {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Smend|de}} and [[Heinrich Besseler]], and sponsors such as [[Bernhard Sprengel]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Otto Benecke|de}} made the project possible, supported by the editor {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Vötterle|de}}.

The [[Neue Bachgesellschaft]] recommended to pursue the project as a joint venture of musicologists in Göttingen, then [[West Germany]], and Leipzig, then [[East Germany]], in order to stress that the common cultural heritage was indivisible. The Bach Archive and the Johann Sebastian Bach Institute collaborated, their directors [[Werner Neumann]] and [[Alfred Dürr]] made the new edition their life's project.  The publishers were [[Bärenreiter]] in [[Kassel]], chosen in 1951 by the Federal Government, and from 1954 the Deutscher Verlag für Musik, a new publisher in Leipzig which was involved until the unification of Germany.

Initially the duration of the edition was estimated as 15 to 20 years, but the scientific work with the sources required much more time than anticipated. The first volumes appeared in 1954. The edition was completed in June 2007.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article939434/Praeludium_zur_Deutschen_Einheit.html |title=Präludium zur Deutschen Einheit |author=Volker Tarnow |date=12 June 2007 |language=German |accessdate=9 January 2011 |publisher=[[Die Welt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraries.uc.edu/libraries/ccm/incs/neuebachausgabe.html |title=Neue Bach-Ausgabe |accessdate=9 January 2011 |publisher=[[University of Cincinnati]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The edition contains in eight series over 100 volumes of scores (Notenbände), each Score (Partitur) volume complemented with a Critical Commentary (Kritischer Bericht) volume. The ninth series contains Addenda (7 volumes), and furthermore there is a  Supplement of 9 volumes (Supplementbände):&lt;ref name="NBA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baerenreiter.com/html/completeedi/Bach/bach-ga.htm |title=Johann Sebastian Bach / 1685-1750 / New Edition of the Complete Works |accessdate=7 January 2011 |publisher=[[Bärenreiter]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103204656/http://baerenreiter.com/html/completeedi/Bach/bach-ga.htm |archivedate=3 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:IX. Addenda (approximately 7 volumes)
:Supplement: Bach Documents (9 volumes)

Each Score volume contains a preface and a selection of [[facsimile]]s of its sources. In the Score volumes variants and fragments of compositions are published along with complete works. The Critical Commentary volumes describe the history and sources (manuscript sources, early editions), and their interdependence, for each composition, and discuss editorial issues.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;

== Relevance ==

The New Bach Edition presents a reliable version of Bach's music for both scientists and performers. Its strict philological methods were exemplary for critical scientific editions in the second half of the 20th century. 

In preparation for the NBE, lost compositions were found, whereas some known compositions proved to be not Bach's works. The examination of the sources corrected the chronology of his compositions.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welt" /&gt;

The second revised edition of the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], and the Bach-Digital website refer to the NBE volume and page number for every listed composition by Bach. In addition to listing the page number of the score, the Bach Digital website also mentions the page number where the composition is discussed in the corresponding Critical Commentary volume.&lt;ref&gt;(BWV&lt;sup&gt;2a&lt;/sup&gt;) [[Alfred Dürr]], Yoshitake Kobayashi (eds.), Kirsten Beißwenger.

In February 2010 the Bach Archive and the publisher announced a revision of single volumes, in order to include new sources and findings. The first in this series of revisions was the [[Mass in B minor]] (updating the second volume of the NBE).
Approximately 15 more volumes are planned, including [[Bach cantata#Weimar|Weimar cantatas]] (five works), the ''[[St John Passion]]'', the motets, the [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|violin sonatas]], the [[Cello Suites (Bach)|cello suites]] and others.&lt;ref name="Revised"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.baerenreiter.com/en/spotlight-on/gesamt-und-werkausgaben/bach-johann-sebastian/nbarev/ | title=New Bach Edition – Revised (NBArev) | publisher=Baerenreiter | accessdate=September 28, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AYaBsn3W?url=https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/spotlight-on/gesamt-und-werkausgaben/bach-johann-sebastian/nbarev/ | archivedate=September 9, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49069">'''New Primitivism''' ([[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: Novi primitivizam, Нови примитивизам) was a [[subculture|subcultural]] movement established in [[Sarajevo]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SR Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] in March 1983. It primarily used music, along with subversive comedy on radio and television as its form of expression. Its protagonists and followers called themselves the '''new primitives'''. 

Even though the movement initially encompassed several bands in the city of Sarajevo, including some such as [[Plavi orkestar]] that quickly distanced themselves from it, the movement predominantly functioned as a banner that summarizes and encompasses the work of two rock bands [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] and [[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] as well as ''[[Top lista nadrealista]]'' radio segment that eventually grew into a television sketch show, the discourse of New Primitivism was seen as primarily irreverent and humorous.

The movement officially disbanded sometime in 1987, although the bands and television show continued up until the breakup of Yugoslavia.

==Characteristics==
Basing itself on the spirit of the Bosnian ordinary populace outside of the cultural mainstream, the movement was credited for introducing the jargon of Sarajevo [[mahala]]s (brimming with slang and Turkish [[loanword]]s) into the official Yugoslav public scene. Many of the New Primitivism songs and sketches involve stories of small people — coalminers, petty criminals, street hoodlums, provincial girls, etc. — being placed in unusual and absurd situations. There are comparisons between ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' and the New Primitives' methods, as they share the short sketch form and utilize [[Surreal humour|absurdity]] as means of eliciting laughs from an audience. The embodiment of New Primitivism is a youth who both reads challenging works such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', but also does not mind getting into fistfights. The movement got established as a Sarajevan reaction to the [[New wave music|New wave]] and [[Punk rock|Punk]] movements that were sweeping the alternative music scene in Yugoslavia. Some of the movement's most notable traits were promoting and popularizing Sarajevan street jargon and slang that was not well known outside of Sarajevo, extolling the mentality and culture of the Sarajevan [[Mahala]], depicting local fringe characters such as petty criminals, alcoholics, lesser-known pop cultural figures, blue-collar workers and local streets hoodlums. Because of this, the movement was concidered locally patriotic and an eclectic expression of Sarajevan urban culture.

The movement's protagonists had a specific view of New Primitivism. Perhaps the most prominent of them, [[Nele Karajlić]], explicated it as being "created within clearly defined historical coordinates, both spatially and temporally, at the precise midpoint between the spot where [[Gavrilo Princip]] [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in June 1914 and the spot where the Olympic flame was [[1984 Winter Olympics|lit]] in February 1984 while temporally, it took place sometime during the period between [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s death in May 1980 and the beginning of the [[Agrokomerc Affair]] in 1987" and seeing it as "resistance to any form of establishment - cultural, social, and political - not just the rock'n'roll one that dominated Sarajevo at the time with so-called 'dinosaur' bands like [[Bijelo Dugme]] and [[Indexi]], which the new primitives held in contempt to a certain extent".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s1B5rt_1CU Glavni tok];RTV Pink, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's dominant method of social and cultural critique was to fully localize the narrative to Sarajevo, and use local urban legends, cultural and social phenomena and living fringe characters as catalysts for painting a wider political picture. In doing so, the movement became both a rigidly local expressional form that gave a platform to the language, culture and myths of the Sarajevan streets, while also breaking out into the wider Yugoslav arena. A major characteristic of the movement was the adoption of pseudonyms by all its leading figures, which tended to be either comical in nature or based on the semantics of nicknames that have always been very prevelent in Sarajevo. The main reason for this was so that none of the members could be ethnically identified. The second reason was to give a platform to the stylization of nicknames that was prominent in Sarajevo - a form of local patriotism and self-mockery. 

The movement's "chief ideologue" [[:sr:Goran Marić (menadžer)|Malkolm Muharem]] referred to New Primitivism simply as "the first Sarajevan bullet to hit its target since Princip assassinated Ferdinand in 1914".

==Origin of the term==
The movement's name — New Primitivism — got introduced as a mock reaction to two early 1980s pop-culture movements: [[New Romanticism]] in the West and [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] in the Yugoslav constituent republic of [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]]. On one hand, the term New Primitivism was a clear anti-reference to New Romantic, as the Sarajevo lads sought to be anything but romantic and sugarsweet while on the other hand, they also wanted to emphasize the stereotypes encountered in many popular Yugoslav jokes about Bosnians and Slovenians — the former portrayed as raw, unsophisticated, dim-witted, and openhearted, and the latter presented as stiff, cold, serious, distant, and calculated. In the artistic and expressional sense, New Primitivism was a reaction to the [[New wave music|New wave]] and [[Punk rock|Punk]] movements.

==History==
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a generation of kids from the Sarajevo neighbourhood of [[Koševo (Sarajevo)|Koševo]], all born in the early to mid-1960s, was coming up. Raised within upper-middle-class families inhabiting post-[[World War II]] apartment buildings typical of communist Yugoslavia, their interests included music, football, and movies. They soon converged on music as their main activity and simultaneous with entering high school started forming bands despite possessing very limited musical skills. Most of their musical influences were found in [[Western world|Western]] popular culture — from early ones such as [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Lou Reed]], the [[Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], etc. to those found later on the emerging punk scene.

By early 1980, the kids were able to adapt a cellar at the 19 Fuada Midžića Street low-rise apartment building into a makeshift rehearsal space where they held band practices, [[chamber play]]s, even an odd [[fashion show]]. Initially very informal with irregular rehearsals and frequently changing lineups (often through swapping band members), by 1981 the bands — named [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] and [[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] — took on a more serious note. Adopting garage/punk rock sensibility, they started devoting more attention to songwriting and began playing small clubs around town. In parallel, from May 1981, some of the kids from both bands got a chance to collaborate on ''[[Top lista nadrealista]]'', a comedy segment on ''Primus'' radio show that aired weekly, Saturday mornings, on [[Radio Sarajevo]]'s channel two.

===Forming a movement===
The idea to create a movement as an umbrella entity encompassing their entire activity had been tossed about for months during the second part of 1982 and early 1983 between the individuals in and around Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors — the band's manager [[Malkolm Muharem]], its main lyricist and mascot [[Elvis J. Kurtović]], and its singer [[Rizo Kurtović]].

Additional notable members of the movement included [[Nele Karajlić|dr. Nele Karajlić]], [[Sejo Sexon|mr. Sejo Sexon]], [[Dražen Ričl]], [[Boris Šiber]], [[Zenit Đozić]], and others from the Sarajevo neighbourhood of [[Koševo (Sarajevo)|Koševo]]. Along the way, individuals outside of the Koševo milieu, most notably [[Branko Đurić|Branko "Đuro" Đurić]], joined in and also became prominent. Despite being a bit older and not from the same neighbourhood, film director [[Emir Kusturica]] (who was already well-established with his award-winning movie ''[[Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?]]'') was an associate and friend of the crew; although his movies can not be directly associated with the movement, their spirit certainly shares some sentiment with New Primitivism. With the bands playing small demo gigs around the city, they encountered other up and coming rock bands such as [[Plavi orkestar]] and [[Crvena jabuka]] that also cultivated similar thematic narratives focused on stories of local small time characters, but would eventually move away from the aesthetic and turn towards the mainstream.  

The movement's wider unofficial unveiling was said have taken place at an Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors gig in Sarajevo's CEDUS club venue during early March 1983. Also playing the gig was Zabranjeno Pušenje. Influenced by movies like 1979's ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]'' that portray the youth scene of London with subcultures like [[Mod (subculture)|mods]], [[Rocker (subculture)|rockers]], and [[teddy boy]]s, the guys from Koševo tried to create their own local version of that.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iWhGnwGUT0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=121 Damar Show];Pink BH, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The formal introduction of the new entity changed nothing in the internal group dynamic as they all continued functioning like a neighbourhood gang of friends, but it gave the press something to latch onto and made it easier to market the bands outside of the city. By his own admission, Muharem used the movement "to create an impression to those in Belgrade and Zagreb that there's something more going on in Sarajevo than there actually is".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeGWqOo7uAI#t=484s Rockovnik - 24. episode Anarhija All over Bascarsija];RTS, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to music and comedy on radio, the lads decided to expand their modes of expression now that they functioned as a movement — attempting to come up with a clothing style to associate with New Primitivism. The movement's unofficial look was thus born with a démodé style consisting of waist tight [[bell-bottoms|bell-bottom pants]], plaid [[suit jacket]]s, thin golden necklace worn above the shirt, and pointy shoes (the so-called ''špicoke'') — similar to the 1970s [[leisure suit]] look — which the lads adopted from petty hoodlums and small-time smugglers and pickpockets seen around [[Baščaršija]] selling, though not wearing, clothing items such as [[Levi's]] 501 jeans that were either smuggled in from [[Italy]] or counterfeit locally in Yugoslavia. Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors especially embraced this throwback look, with young crowds soon showing up to their club gigs dressed this way. Meanwhile, Karajlić came up with the movement's unofficial creed: "Tuđe hoćemo, svoje nemamo" ("What's not ours, we want; because ours, we haven't got."), a parody on one of the often used political slogans of the communist period: "Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo." ("What's not ours, we don't want; ours, we won't give up on.").
{{quote box|quote=''During summer 1983, after getting back from an out-of-town gig somewhere, we went to our favourite [[kafana]] Dedan at [[Baščaršija]] where our friend [[Branko Đurić|Đuro]] told us about a journalist from [[:sh:Start (magazin)|Start]] looking for us to do an interview. We were convinced Đuro's fucking with us, but he insisted, telling us the guy had already looked for us at [[Televizija Sarajevo|TV Sarajevo]] (where of course no one ever heard of us), at [[Diskoton]] (where they were also clueless as to who we are), before finally resorting to asking about us from kafana to kafana and eventually ending up at Dedan, leaving a phone number with Đuro. This confirmed to us once more what we had already picked up on during our out-of-town gigs — that people outside of the city are taking our braggadocios and bombastic proclamations in the youth print about being the 'kings of Sarajevo' quite literally and quite seriously. In reality we were complete unknowns. Media outlets in Sarajevo didn't give two shits about us, but we noticed that our embellished stories found a receptive audience in youth print media from other Yugoslav cities. They especially lapped up our tales of this 'great new movement in Sarajevo called New Primitivism'.''&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/meteorski-uspon-elvisa-j-kurtovica/228133|title=Meteorski uspon Elvisa J.

One of the very first activities on the movement's behalf was writing an [[open letter]] to Sarajevo's own [[Goran Bregović]], the best known and the most established rock musician in Yugoslavia, who was at the moment going through a well-documented creative and commercial crisis with his band [[Bijelo Dugme]]'s [[Uspavanka za Radmilu M.|latest studio effort]] getting poor reviews and selling underwhelmingly, not to mention constant reports of infighting and vocalist [[Željko Bebek]]'s imminent departure. Dripping with jovial sarcasm and backhanded compliments, the new primitives' letter invited Bregović to join them, offering him a fresh start along with a creative reset.

===Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors get the ball rolling===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Elvis.j.kurtovic.jpg|335px|thumb|right|[[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] before a concert in [[Kulušić]], [[Zagreb]].]] --&gt;
[[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] were the first to establish a bit of a buzz on the scene. Promoted by Muharem, who in addition to the band's business side also handled many of its creative aspects, EJK&amp;HM were not only gigging in clubs around Sarajevo, but in 1983 also started playing clubs nationwide, in Belgrade ([[Studentski kulturni centar (Belgrade)|SKC]]), Zagreb ([[Kulušić]] and Lapidarij), Rijeka (Palah), Pula, etc., getting enthusiastic reactions from young club crowds everywhere. Though their sound was hardly original with straight covers of the [[Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], etc. dominating the repertoire, EJK&amp;HM live shows were a unique mixture of rock'n'roll with elements of [[performance art]] and [[stand-up comedy]], full of youthful exuberance with Elvis J. Kurtović, the band's lyrics writer and mascot, constantly interacting with the crowd between songs. They mostly played student clubs with their promotional activities strictly limited to printed press.&lt;ref name="damar"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GnqP6kskh8 Elvis J. Kurtovic @ Damar]&lt;/ref&gt; Muharem would get them publicity by talking up New Primitivism and ensuring journalists from youth-oriented papers — ''[[Džuboks]]'' and ''Reporter'' from Belgrade, ''Polet'' from Zagreb, and ''[[Mladina]]'' from Ljubljana — have the 'right angle' for the story while the band members would contribute by providing colourful interviews and quotable sound bytes often delivered in form of a [[manifesto]].

In late July 1983, the fledgling band received a huge boost after ''[[:sh:Start (magazin)|Start]]'', a Yugoslavia-wide high-circulation weekly newsmagazine in the vein of ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Lui]]'', deployed its journalist [[Goran Gajić]] to Sarajevo for a story on the unconventional group.&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; Published as a two-page spread headlined "Meteorski uspon Elvisa J. Kurtovića" (Elvis J. Kurtović's Meteoric Rise) in a magazine that's circulated in 200,000 copies, the story was by far the biggest media exposure the band had gotten up to that point. Building upon talking points already well established and developed by Muharem and Kurtović through the country's youth print media, the ''Start'' piece was extremely affirmative and flattering for the EJK&amp;HM youngsters — proclaiming them to be "the next important thing in Yugoslav rock".&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; Along with a new batch of the band members' trademark off-the-wall soundbytes sprinkled throughout, the article also re-published — on Muharem's insistence despite Kurtović's apparent opposition&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; — their sarcastic open letter to Goran Bregović that thus got a much bigger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jergović|first=Miljenko|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/miljenko-jergovic/miljenko/255037|title=Iz vremena kada očevi nisu znali protiv koga to pjevaju njihova djeca|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=27 February 2017|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riding the wave of publicity generated by the ''Start'' piece, Muharem acted quickly in the fall of 1983 by ambitiously booking Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors for a double bill concert with [[D' Boys]] at Sarajevo's Đuro Đaković Hall, an all-seater venue holding almost a thousand people.&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; The show sold out quickly and was a smashing success, a remarkable triumph for a band that at the time hadn't been on television yet and still had no studio recordings.&lt;ref name="damar"/&gt;

Muharem soon arranged for the band to get some time in Akvarijus studio in Belgrade during December 1983 in order to record material for their debut album whose production was originally supposed to be handled by Peđa Vranešević of [[Laboratorija Zvuka]], but was eventually done by [[Goran Vejvoda]] as well as Elvis J. Kurtović and Muharem themselves. [[Margita Stefanović]] from [[Katarina II]] made a guest appearance on the synthesizer during the album recording sessions as her band was recording its own [[Katarina II (album)|debut album]] in the same studio at the same time.

EJK&amp;HM and Muharem soon agreed a record contract with [[Založba kaset in plošč RTV Ljubljana|ZKP RTLj]] and their debut album ''[[Mitovi i legende o Kralju Elvisu]]'' came out in February 1984 right in the middle of the Winter Olympics being held in the city. Figuring that promoting the album during the Olympics would get them extra attention due to all the press and other visitors gathered in the city, EJK&amp;HM held a press junket that largely turned shambolic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/30-godina-mitova-i-legendi/175242|title=30 godina 'Mitova i legendi...'|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=23 December 2014|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a series of club gigs at the popular student club Trasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/olimpijada-jurek-burek/74103|title=Olimpijada, Jurek, burek|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=14 February 2012|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also made one of their first proper TV appearances, lip-synching "Baščaršy Hanumen" on ''Hit meseca'' (Yugoslav counterpart to ''[[Top of the Pops]]'') while hamming it up for the cameras. The album release was followed by a promotional club tour of bigger Yugoslav cities, but since the record was selling poorly with less than 15,000 copies sold, the tour ended quickly and the deflated band members returned to Sarajevo.

Malkolm Muharem soon quit working with the band.

===''Das ist Walter'' released and ''Top lista nadrealista'' starts on television===

A few months later, in April 1984, Zabranjeno Pušenje's debut album ''[[Das ist Walter]]'' came out for [[Jugoton]] in limited issue of 3,000 copies, clearly indicative of the label's extremely low commercial expectations. Recorded in immensely modest circumstances and over an unreasonably long period of 7 months due to reasons beyond their control, the album features punk and garage rock sensibility with songs referencing local toponyms and social strata such as an obscure Sarajevo movie theater, Bosnian coal miners, local thugs from various city neighbourhoods, a local hoodlum being incarcerated in the [[Zenica prison]] etc. Its initial sales were nothing to speak of.

Simultaneously with the album release, ''Top lista nadrealista'' moved to television as a weekly sketch comedy programme. The shows started airing on 2 June 1984 on [[BHT 1|TV Sarajevo]]'s channel two as well as on [[Yugoslav Radio Television|JRT]] exchange for the rest of the country. Despite being placed in a milieu well removed from their natural setting — their comedy sketches were essentially fillers in-between [[Narodna muzika|folk music]] numbers — the show eventually proved a good vehicle for reaching a wider audience. After the opening few episodes that were largely met with indifference, the show started gaining a bit of an audience outside of its Sarajevo youth core with whom it had immediately struck a cord.

This gradually increased viewership of ''Top lista nadrealista'' had a positive effect on ''[[Das ist Walter]]'' sales. Riding the buzz created by the TV show as well as the growing popularity of the "Zenica Blues" track (cover of [[Johnny Cash]]'s "San Quentin"), Karajlić's and Sexon's blend of punk and local storytelling began finding an increasingly receptive audience months after its initial release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.story.rs/intervju/3070-nele-karajlic-trudim-se-da-budem-dobar-tata-i-muz.html Karajlic interview];''Story'', 4 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; No one was more surprised at this turn of events than the label itself as it was forced to order multiple new batches of the album copies on records and cassettes.

New Primitivism as a term also started catching on as Yugoslav media began using it when referencing the band's style or when talking about the television show. Also, another of the more popular songs on the album, "Anarhija All Over Baščaršija" (Anarchy All Over [[Baščaršija]]), explicitly mentions New Primitives, bringing them up in the context of "violent locals from [[Vratnik, Sarajevo|Vratnik]] who listen to [[narodna muzika|Yugoslav folk music]], attack [[hippie]]s, and are repulsed by the [[Western world|West]]".

On 15 September 1984 as ''Top lista nadrealista'' episodes resumed broadcasting following the summer break, the band played Sarajevo's Dom mladih on a bill that also included [[Bajaga i Instruktori]] in front of a raucous crowd of 4,500. The band was officially out of the clubs and now playing larger halls. In October, Zabranjeno Pušenje went to Belgrade for a show at [[Studentski kulturni centar|SKC]] where they were surprised to discover their newly found popularity. In addition to having to add an extra show in the same venue the next day due to popular demand, they also started getting recognized by kids on the street. The two SKC shows launched the band on an extensive and successful Yugoslavia-wide tour; on 4 November 1984 they sold out [[Hala sportova]], a sports arena in Belgrade with 6,000 in attendance. They would end up playing over 60 concerts on that tour.

In parallel, the album sales ended up hitting the 100,000 mark while the term New Primitives also became well established in the process. However, the increased profile also meant increased scrutiny as Karajlić and the band were about to find out.

===The 'Marshall' affair...===
At a concert in [[Rijeka]]'s [[Dvorana Mladosti]] before a crowd of some two and a half thousand people on Tuesday, 27 November 1984, the band inadvertently set off a firestorm of controversy.
{{quote box|quote=''Following my lawyer's advice, the defense I presented at the 'Marshal has croaked' court hearings was continuously denying I ever said the remark they accused me of saying. My lawyer, being an intelligent man fully aware of the particular point in time, politically, in Yugoslavia, knew the extent to which this mad witch-hunt could've gone to had I admitted to actually uttering the remark. He also knew 'Marshal has croaked', which still sounded like blasphemy in 1984, would soon take on a whole different contextual meaning. And really, within a short few years, figuratively speaking, 'Marshal has croaked' became an official political programme for many of the newly founded political parties that were in the process of gaining strength and eventually winning power all over Yugoslavia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0qZHB6XIRs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=50s |title=Glavni tok |agency=RTV Pink |date=1990s}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Nele Karajlić on the 1985-86 verbal offence court case against him|width=20%|align=right}}
During [[soundcheck]] before the show, the band's amplifier went bust to which Karajlić jokingly exclaimed: "Crk'o maršal" (The "Marshall has croaked!"), followed by a pause before adding: "Mislim na pojačalo" ("The [[Marshall Amplification|amplifier]], that is") (a [[switcheroo]] remark about the 1980 death of Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]), getting a chuckle from a small group of people within the earshot. Liking the reaction he got during soundcheck, he decided to start the actual concert by delivering the same joke as an explanation to why the show is starting late.

There was hardly any negative reactions during the concert or immediately after it, and the band continued its tour with a triumphant concert at Ledena dvorana in Zagreb in front of 12,000 fans on 10 December 1984. Though a few write-ups mentioning Karajlić's marshal quip appeared in neutral tone in Zagreb-based papers leading up to the concert, it would be the op-ed piece by journalist Veljko Vičević in Rijeka-based daily newspaper ''[[Novi list]]'' that started the avalanche with far-reaching consequences. Headlined "Opak dim Zabranjenog pušenja" (Zabranjeno Pušenje's Sinister Smoke), Vičević strongly denounces the band for lack of morals and stepping over the line, and additionally reproaches the group members for things they said in the past such as "Tuđe hoćemo/nećemo, svoje nemamo".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSQXINde0GM#t=276s Opak dim Zabranjenog pusenja]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the initial stone and the signal for numerous bodies of the communist system to criticize the band (as well as, by proxy, new primitives and ''Top lista nadrealista'') on various grounds. The controversy also served to open another front in the row between two internal factions wrestling for the control of [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]]'s SSO, the provincial branch of the [[League of Socialist Youth of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Socialist Youth League]] (SSOJ), itself a youth wing of the [[one-party state|country's one and only political party]] — [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist League]] (SKJ). Since the Rijeka concert was organized by the local pro-[[Stipe Šuvar|Šuvar]] SSO in Rijeka, the rival pro-[[Vladimir Bakarić|Bakarić]] faction within the organization used Karajlić's Marshal quip to smear the organizing group.

By January 1985, news of the Rijeka flap made it back to Sarajevo where more journalists, most notably Pavle Pavlović in the ''As'' newspaper, were ready to condemn the band further. In his piece headlined "Otrovni dim Zabranjenog pušenja" (Zabranjeno Pušenje's Poisonous Smoke), Pavlović labels Karajlić's words "an insensitive association and piece of sarcasm that insults right to the heart". The columnist then trails off to even take ideological issue with the humorous sound bytes in radio jingles promoting the December 1984 release of the ''Top lista nadrealista'' radio material on audio cassette by [[Diskoton]]. He continues by predicting that "the young band's life span will be little longer than that of a [[butterfly]]" before adding that "sadly even such short time is enough to indoctrinate the impressionable kids with new thoughts, including continuous ridicule of everything that we've created so far as well as banal, low-brow tampering with the basic tenet of the [[Yugoslav People's Liberation War|People's Liberation War]] — Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo". Pavlović concludes by musing "whether the time has come to extinguish Zabranjeno Pušenje's poisonous smoke for good".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media.ba/mcsonline/files/shared/Pavle_P.pdf Otrovni dim Zabranjenog Pusenja]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://protest.ba/v2/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Otrovni-dim-Zabranjenog-pu%C5%A1enja.jpg Otrovni dim...]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a communist country where verbal offence was defined as a crime and as such punishable by law, Karajlić and other band members were summoned for dozens of police questionings. Communist Yugoslavia had its [[sacred cow (idiom)|sacred cow]]s and public criticism or ridicule, either veiled or open, of Tito, the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|party]], or the People's Liberation War was grounds for severe punishment. Karajlić ended up being taken to court with a criminal charge that was eventually reduced to a misdemeanor one in a legal process that stretched on for years.

===...and its consequences===
However, an even bigger problem was that Zabranjeno Pušenje became blacklisted as a result of the Marshal episode. While not banned outright, their songs were taken off radio playlists, their access to television was restricted, and more than 30 of their already booked concerts in early 1985 ended up getting cancelled due to pressure from above that manifested itself through sudden introduction of administrative obstacles such as denying permits for the venues on the day of the show and so on.&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"/&gt;

Throughout January 1985, the new primitives experienced multiple bizarre manifestations of this sudden anti-Zabranjeno Pušenje hysteria in Sarajevo.

Each January, during winter school break, TV Sarajevo's daytime schedule consisted of various kids' shows reruns, and one such show happened to feature the band's hit song "Zenica Blues". Not being aware of that, the technician running the [[control room]] that day let the show air by mistake. Since Zabranjeno Pušenje were essentially banned from the station, TV Sarajevo executives found it sufficiently necessary to apologize for the oversight later that day in the station's central daily newscast ''Dnevnik 2'' and also to issue temporary suspensions both to the technician as well as to the executive in charge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reDtowLheLA#t=733s Glavni tok];RTV Pink, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt;

By association, the hysteria also spread to ''Top lista nadrealista'' activities. While promoting the freshly released audio cassette in Sarajevo containing the best of compilation of 'Top lista nadrealista' radio segment, there was such a stigma attached to the group's activity in the city that not a single journalists was brave enough to show up at the promotional press event at Muzikalije record store in [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer|Štrosmajerova]] Street, fearing that being seen there would be interpreted as a public show of support for beleaguered Karajlić and the rest of his mates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media.ba/bs/magazin-etika/cenzura-na-radiju-80-ih Cenzura na radiju 80-ih], media.ba, 6 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempting to rectify and calm the situation, members of Zabranjeno Pušenje issued a letter to all socio-political organizations within Sarajevo and the Socialist Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the print media outlets that had been criticizing the band. The gist of the letter was the claim that they never insulted the image and legacy of Comrade Tito thus denying media reports claiming otherwise and labeling them "monstrous lies".&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"&gt;{{cite news|first=Slavoljub|last=Marković|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2016/02/zabranjeno-pusenje-afera-crko-marsal.html|title=O društveno-političkoj odgovornosti rock-zvezda: Filter ili muštikla|agency=''Reporter''|date=February 1985|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the letter was generally ignored within Sarajevo and SR Bosnia-Herzegovina as the only press outlets to publish it were Zagreb's youth paper ''Polet'' and later Belgrade's ''[[Politika]]''.&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"/&gt;

Due to all the problems and hassle suddenly associated with organizing a Zabranjeno Pušenje gig, local promoters began avoiding the band despite clear demand for their concerts. Finding itself increasingly isolated in addition to seeing its commercial momentum slip away, the band decided to invest all its energy into organizing a single high-profile gig that would hopefully as much as anything serve as a statement of encouragement for all potential promoters not to shy away from the band. Still, despite selling out [[Hala Pionir]] in Belgrade on Saturday, 16 February 1985 with more than 7,000 people in attendance, the concert didn't have the desired media effect and the band's downward slide continued with gigs now completely dried up.

Facing insurmountable obstacles, the group gave in temporarily, deciding to lay low for some time while some of the members went back to making ''Top lista nadrealista'' on Radio Sarajevo. However, in March 1985, the authorities put an end to that too, removing the segment for good from the radio schedule.

Just as the career of one New Primitivism band, Zabranjeno Pušenje, was suddenly spiraling downhill, another band from the same milieu, [[Plavi Orkestar]], was getting big.

Other bands that at one time or another identified with New Primitives include: [[Bombaj Štampa]], [[Plavi Orkestar]], [[Dinar (band)|Dinar]] and [[Crvena Jabuka]], although they quickly moved on to more commercial and communicative forms of expression.

===''Soldatski bal''  hits it big===
Though the torch of New Primitivsm had primarily been carried by Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Zabranjeno Pušenje, other bands were also associated with the movement.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PlavOrkestar cover of Svijet June 1985.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Despite [[Plavi Orkestar]]'s fragmentary association with New Primitivism, the movement arguably got its biggest media promotion via the enormous commercial success of the band's debut album ''[[Soldatski bal]]'' in early 1985.]] --&gt;
After splitting with Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors following the lacklustre reception of their debut album, crafty manager Malkolm Muharem switched over to another local Sarajevo outfit — [[Plavi Orkestar]] — a band that had also been gigging on the city's student club scene for some time already and was now looking to take the next step by recording and releasing a studio album. Though also starting out as a garage/punk rock group that often crossed paths with Pušenje and EJK (Orkestar's bassist Ćera I even played on Pušenje's demo recordings before joining Orkestar while the bands also often held club gigs together), over time, especially after achieving stable lineup of Loša, Pava, Ćera I, and Ćera II in early summer 1983, Plavi Orkestar moved to more conventional forms of expression within Yugoslav general cultural context. In practice, that meant pretty much abandoning punk in favour of pop and openly flirting with Yugoslav commercial folk in their sound. Though opening doors for them commercially, this practice somewhat placed them on the fringes of New Primitivism. Compared to the two main new primitive outfits, their stage appearance was far more orderly and their lyrics were less cerebral.

Nevertheless, Muharem saw a new opportunity with the four fresh-faced lads each of whom just turned 20 having recently returned to the city from their respective year-long mandatory [[Yugoslav People's Army|army]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/o-marusi-razglednici-iz-nisa-i-prestanku-pusenja/100032|title=O Maruši, razglednici iz Niša i prestanku pušenja|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=15 January 2013|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 1984 when Muharem took the youngsters under his wing, the band barely existed as its main creative duo — frontman [[Saša Lošić]] and guitarist Mladen "Pava" Pavičić — were not on speaking terms and Pava left the band. Not deterred, Muharem took the remaining three members to Zagreb and through personal connections got [[Parni Valjak]]'s Husein "Hus" Hasanefendić to record a few more demos with them, while also managing to secure a pre-contract with Jugoton.

The news of the pre-contract signing brought Pavičić back into the fold and by January 1985 all four were off to Zagreb to record in [[SIM studio]]. The album named ''[[Soldatski bal]]'' came out in February 1985 and instantly created a sensation all over Yugoslavia, placing the young band among the most successful Yugoslav rock acts like Bijelo Dugme and [[Riblja Čorba]]. Muharem essentially stayed true to the promotional techniques he previously implemented with Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors — print media and soundbytes — though the sarcastic bravado of EJK&amp;HM was now replaced with Plavi Orkestar's dreamy boyish charm. However, this time it had a tremendous commercial effect as the band embarked on a Yugoslavia-wide tour in late summer 1985 with scenes of thousands of screaming and fainting teenage girls repeated in town after town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2012/11/pop-fenomeni-plavi-orkestar-djeca-su.html Pop fenomeni: Plavi orkestar - Djeca su čisto poludjela!];September 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Named 'Bolje biti pijan nego star' (Better Drunk than Old) after the band's hit track, the tour included 140 concerts in sports arenas and other large venues throughout the country. Muharem additionally hired journalist-turned-filmmaker Goran Gajić to shoot a tour documentary thus reuniting with him two years after Gajić wrote a glowing summer 1983 piece on Elvis J. Kurtović in ''Start''. Furthermore, Gajić directed a video for Plavi Orkestar's hit track "Kad mi kažeš, paša" featuring actresses [[Tanja Bošković]], [[Sonja Savić]], journalist Mirjana Bobić-Mojsilović, and TV personality [[Suzana Mančić]]. The album ended up selling 550,000 copies. Though with unexpected and sudden success the band's sensibility quickly transformed even more into folkish pop as they almost morphed into a sugary [[boy band]], many media outlets still presented them as a new primitive group, giving the movement unprecedented promotion in Yugoslavia during the first half of 1985.

==Reaction and reception==
Initial wider media reaction to the movement wasn't positive. During New Primitivism's nascent stage, following a summer 1983 double-bill concert by Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Plavi Orkestar at Belgrade's SKC, a [[blurb]] appeared in the high-circulation ''[[Politika]]'' daily reviewing the show, but also discussing the movement in general. In his negative review, rock critic Ljuba Trifunović placed New Primitivsm in the same context with commercial [[narodna muzika|folk]] singer [[Lepa Brena]]'s then current flirtation with rock sound ("[[naïve art|naïve]] rock"), expressing disappointment that "both appeared precisely when we began to think [[Yugoslav rock]] finally became immune to such diseases due to [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|new wave]] effectively washing away the so-called '[[Bijelo Dugme#.22Shepherd rock.22 years: rise to fame and .22Dugmemania.22 .281974.E2.80.9379.29|shepherd's rock]]' and all of its derivatives". Seeing New Primitivsm in continuity with several past offerings from the Sarajevo musical scene such as composer [[Nikola Borota Radovan]]'s opus, [[Jutro]], early [[Bijelo Dugme]], and [[Milić Vukašinović]]'s collaboration with [[Hanka Paldum]], Trifunović felt that adjective "new" was entirely superfluous in the movement's name: "Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Plavi Orkestar are representatives of this renewed and stripped-down [[primitive culture|primitivsm]], and even if some inconsequential differences do exist when comparing the two bands' interpretative [[wikt:dilettante|dilettantism]] (with EJK&amp;HM coming out on top), what's really depressing is their absolute creative [[pathos]] embodied in the creed 'let's be ourselves' - primitive Balkanoids".&lt;ref&gt;[http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190 In the Name of Love];''Politika'', summer 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

As the movement got more profiled in late 1983 and especially throughout 1984 with the emergence of Zabranjeno Pušenje's debut album and the start of ''Top lista nadrealista'' on television, it began getting better media notices.

In July 1984, rock critic Darko Glavan wrote a detailed opinion piece on New Primitivism in general as well as EJK&amp;HM and Zabranjeno Pušenje specifically. Expressing mild approval, he summarized his personal acceptance of the movement: "If someone likes them, I'm not going to dissuade them, however, if someone doesn't like them, I'm not going to attempt convincing them otherwise". Furthermore, while noting new primitives are deserving of the media attention they've been receiving, he wondered whether they're getting too much publicity because "they are terrific as an added flavourful spice to a developed and varied rock scene, but can hardly function as the dominant trend".&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"&gt;{{cite news|last=Glavan|first=Darko|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2016/06/muzicko-leto-1984-darko-glavan-o-novom.html|title=Muzicko leto 1984, Darko Glavan o novom primitivizmu: Imaju li Elvis i Nele pretjerani publicitet?|agency=''Studio''|date=July 1984|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on EJK&amp;HM, he labelled them "Bosnia's answer to [[Sha Na Na]]", before proclaiming them an acceptable form of entertainment for the general masses and a welcome break from incoherent [[art rock]] pretentiousness. Though further expressing skepticism whether this is still enough for a conventional rock career, citing EJK&amp;HM's unwillingness to freshen up their repetitive jokes and yucks as a concern for their long term career prospects.&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"/&gt; Glavan was more upbeat about Pušenje, finding them to be "more musical, more talented, and in the context of an [[LP record|LP]], simply stronger than EJK&amp;HM". Comparing Pušenje to [[The Clash]] in addition to extolling their artistic ambition that "saves them from becoming one-dimensional caricatures and additionally invokes locally flavoured stylized [[Italian neorealism|neorealism]] of [[Emir Kusturica]]'s ''[[Do You Remember Dolly Bell?|Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?]]''", Glavan felt that, despite occasionally failing to properly articulate their inventiveness, the band has a fresh voice and a couple of great tracks off their debut album.&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"/&gt;

[[Goran Bregović]] once referred to New Primitivism as "''the only authentic Yugoslav answer to [[punk subculture|punk]]''".

Novelist [[Miljenko Jergović]] considered it "a general cultural emancipatory movement that was supposed to rid the Bosnians of their eternal [[inferiority complex]] towards Zagreb and Belgrade".&lt;ref&gt;[http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190 In the Name of Love];Ogledalo, early 1990s&lt;/ref&gt;

In his scathing 1993 rebuke of the movement, Muhidin Džanko, a professor at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, labeled New Primitivism an "exceptionally [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]] movement" that "thanks to the charisma of its protagonists, managed to directly obstruct and even eliminate the national feelings of the Bosnian Muslim youth, majority of whom are proud members of the 'new primitive nation'". He furthermore saw the [[poetics]] of New Primitivism to be rooted in its specific language containing "supposed speech patterns and parlance of the Sarajevo [[Baščaršija|čaršija]] and [[mahala]]s", before rejecting it as a "cheap trick meant to lampoon the traditional verbal expression of Sarajevo Muslims and degrade their [[Oriental]] [[lexicology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Džanko|first=Muhidin|url=http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190|title=Sarajevski novi primitivizam - Pokret za destrukciju muslimanskog nacionalnog bića|agency=|date=1993|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zoran Kostić (musician)|Zoran "Cane" Kostić]], the [[Partibrejkers]] frontman, wasn't a fan of the movement; in 1997 he mentioned it in passing during an interview: "Bosnians ([[Plavi Orkestar]] and [[Crvena Jabuka]]) took over Belgrade sometime around 1986 and it was because of these raucous new primitive guys that they were able to pull that off. They were their [[Trojan Horse]]s. I never got into that new primitive thing precisely because I saw something else in it. I mean, in the end, their schtick enabled all these dumb bands such as [[Valentino (band)|Valentino]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nin.co.rs/arhiva/2436/3.html Ispovest: Zoran Kostic Cane, partibrejker: BEZ TRIKA I FOLIRANJA];''NIN'', 5 September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zabranjeno.pusenje1.jpg|335px|thumb|right|[[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] in 1987 during the ''[[Pozdrav iz zemlje Safari]]'' tour.]] --&gt;
New Primitivism as a sub-cultural movement retained prominence well after its demise.

To many it also gained added relevance in the context of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]. Books like 2013's ''Shake, Rattle and Roll: Yugoslav Rock Music and the Poetics of Social Critique'' written by Dalibor Mišina, assistant professor of sociology at [[Lakehead University]], devote a significant portion to the study of New Primitivism's overall significance in the last decade of SFR Yugoslavia's existence, arguing that the country could've survived had it adopted values propagated by New Primitivism and similar genres as its new cultural model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/Shake-Rattle-Roll-Yugoslav-Critique/dp/1409445658/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360563221&amp;sr=1-1 Shake, Rattle and Roll: Yugoslav Rock Music and the Poetics of Social Critique]&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked in 2012 whether New Primitivism was a political or a cultural movement, Nele Karajlić said: {{cquote|''It was a fuckabout that got taken a little too seriously in the end. It was created as our answer to global musical trends that the Western music industry had been manufacturing and launching in regular intervals in order to sell more records. Whenever there's a lull in sales, the industry comes up with something called, say, [[New Romanticism]], for example. And then, a band appears and it's called [[Ultravox]], for example, so we all cut our hair like Ultravox and we buy that thing for a year or year and a half. And then it's time for New Something Else, and the same cycle is repeated over again..... As sensitive and receptive consumers of pop-culture we quickly realized the whole thing is a sham so we decided to "join" the musical industry by coming up with our own movement. New Primitivism would've been genius had it been taken over and fostered by a serious conceptual artist willing to invest at least as much energy in it as those Slovenian dudes did in their [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]]. However, speaking objectively, that was impossible because the guys in NSK took their thing seriously while we never got past the fucking around stage..... I should also add that the biggest difference between New Primitivism and NSK was the fact that "old primitivism" tangibly existed while the "Altslowenische Kunst", strictly speaking, never did''.&lt;ref&gt;"Smisao nadrealizma dr. Neleta Karajlića", Nebojša Grujičić &amp; Jovana Gligorijević, ''Vreme'' issue #1144, Belgrade, 6 December 2012, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://postimage.org/image/69sdmb66p/full/]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Discussing the interest New Primitivism has been getting from social scientific circles, Elvis J. Kurtović wrote in his online column in 2013: {{cquote|''Once in a blue moon, I'll get a call from someone saying they're a researcher working at some university and they want to ask me questions about New Primitivism. My immediate reaction is to fuck with them. However, when they later send me a nicely bound hardcover book, I must say I'm filled with pride. Nothing gives me more satisfaction than seeing 30-year-old crap I wrote purely out of spite, indolence, or malevolence, now translated into English and dissected by serious people for deeper meaning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/hoce-hoce-al/101470|title=Hoće, hoće, al'...|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=29 January 2013|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Optomyography (OMG)''' was proposed in 2015 as a technique that could be used to monitor muscular activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Optomyography (OMG): A Novel Technique for the Detection of Muscle Surface Displacement Using Photoelectric Sensors |last1=Hamid Muhammed |first1=Hamed |last2=Raghavendra |first2=Jammalamadaka |date=2015 |conference=Measurements - Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Bioelectromagnetism, International Society for Bioelectromagnetism |volume=10 |url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:886303}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to use OMG for the same applications where [[Electromyography]] (EMG) and [[Mechanomyography]] (MMG) are used. However, OMG offers superior [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and improved robustness against the disturbing factors and limitations of EMG and MMG.
The basic principle of OMG is to use active near-infra-red optical sensors to measure the variations in the measured signals that are reflected from the surface of the skin while activating the muscles below and around the skin spot where the photoelectric sensor is focusing to measure the signals reflected from this spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=A New Approach for Rehabilitation and Upper-Limb Prosthesis Control Using Optomyography (OMG) |last1=Hamid Muhammed |first1=Hamed |last2=Raghavendra |first2=Jammalamadaka |date=2016 |conference=THE 1ST 2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING (IBIOMED 2016) |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7869814/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Generating proper control signals is the most important task to be able to control any kind of a prosthesis, computer game or any other system which contains a human-computer interaction unit or module. For this purpose, surface-Electromyographic (s-EMG) and Mechanomyographic (MMG) signals are measured during muscular activities and used, not only for monitoring and assessing these activities, but also to help in providing efficient rehabilitation treatment for patients suffering from disabilities as well as in constructing and controlling sophisticated prostheses for various types of amputees and disabilities. However, while the existing s-EMG and MMG based systems have compelling benefits, many engineering challenges still remain unsolved, especially with regard to the sensory control system.

[[Image:Penetration sizing.jpg|thumb|right|Common guidelines for the proper sizing of [[firestop]]s, to provide accurate pricing and accountability for field variances.]]
'''Penetrants''', or '''penetrating items''', are the mechanical, electrical or structural items that pass through an opening in a wall or floor, such as [[plumbing|pipes]], [[conduit (electrical)|electrical conduits]], [[Duct (HVAC)|ducting]], [[electrical cable]]s and [[cable tray]]s, or [[structural steel]] beams and columns.  When these items pierce a wall or floor assembly, they create a space between the penetrant and the  surrounding structure, which can become an avenue for the spread of fire between rooms or floors.   Modern [[building code]]s generally require a service [[Penetration (firestop)|penetration]] [[firestop]] to seal the openings around penetrants (or "services"), in order to restore the [[fire-resistance rating]] of the parent assembly.  

Sizing of all openings has significant impact upon the adherence to the [[certification listing]] requirements. Therefore, communication between all affected trades is of great importance ''before'' any openings are made, to ensure proper sizing of the openings for [[cost]] control and conformance with [[listing and approval use and compliance]].

Penetrants are typically accommodated by plumbers and electricians, who prepare for them by installing sleeves in [[concrete]] walls and floors, before they are poured.  In the case of [[masonry]] walls, electricians and plumbers tend to be there first and hang sleeves around their piping, ductwork and conduit, where they know from their drawings that block walls will be erected, in order to avoid the time and expense of having to ''cut'' openings in existing walls and floors.

In the case of [[drywall]] assemblies, the opening size is determined by the drywall contractor, unless the mechanical and electrical trades are [[contract]]ually [[obligation|obliged]] to provide sleeving here as well, with proper [[fastener|fastening]] methods that are in conformance with the certification listing. It is not uncommon for these trades to attempt to absolve themselves of the requirement to firestop their openings in the drywall assemblies by claiming that they were there first, meaning that others should take care of the rest. Since drywall [[Subcontractor|contractor]]s are not ordinarily required to do mechanical and electrical firestopping, the drywall openings can become an item of dispute or [[negligence|neglect]], particularly in [[North America]]n [[construction]]. This common issue can be minimised by designating a separate firestopping sub-contract, whereby a separate speciality sub-contractor firestops ''all'' openings on site, mechanical, electrical and structural, as well as the [[Joint (building)|building joints]]. 

Timber floor openings are simply cut by means of a [[chainsaw]]. In this case, the width of the blade will determine sizes.

'''Cognitive planning''' is one of the [[executive function]]s. It encompasses the [[neurological]] processes involved in the formulation, evaluation and selection of a sequence of thoughts and actions to achieve a desired goal. Various studies utilizing a combination of [[neuropsychological]], neuropharmacological and functional [[neuroimaging]] approaches have suggested there is a positive relationship between impaired planning ability and damage to the [[frontal lobe]].

A specific area within the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex located in the frontal lobe has been implicated as playing an intrinsic role in both cognitive planning and associated executive traits such as [[working memory]].

Disruption of the [[neural pathway]]s, via various mechanisms such as [[traumatic brain injury]], or the effects of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s between this area of the frontal cortex and the [[basal ganglia]] specifically the [[striatum]] (cortico-striatal pathway), may disrupt the processes required for normal planning function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9421831 | volume=53 | issue=4 | title=Cognitive planning in humans: neuropsychological, neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological perspectives | date=November 1997 | journal=Prog.

==Neuropsychological tests==
[[File:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|thumb|right|Animation of a four disc version of the [[Tower of Hanoi]].|alt=A version of the Tower of Hanoi utilizing four discs.]]
There are a variety of neuropsychological tests which can be used to measure variance of planning ability between the subject and controls.

*'''[[Tower of Hanoi]]''' (TOH-R), a puzzle invented in 1883 by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas. There are variations of the puzzle - the classic version consists of three rods and usually seven to nine  discs of subsequently smaller size. Planning is a key component of the problem solving skills necessary to achieve the objective, which is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:
**Only one disk may be moved at a time.
**Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.
**No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welsh | first1 = MC | last2 = Huizinga | first2 = M | date = June 2001 | title = The development and preliminary validation of the Tower of Hanoi-revised | url = | journal = Assessment | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 167–76 | pmid = 11428696 | doi=10.1177/107319110100800205}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = JR | last2 = Albert | first2 = MV | last3 = Fincham | first3 = JM | date = August 2005 | title = Tracing problem solving in real time: fMRI analysis of the subject-paced Tower of Hanoi | url = | journal = J Cogn Neurosci | volume = 17 | issue = 8| pages = 1261–74 | doi = 10.1162/0898929055002427 | pmid = 16197682 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Tower of London test|Tower of London]]''' (TOL) is another test that was developed in 1982 (Shallice 1982) specifically to detect deficits in planning as may occur with damage to the frontal lobe.  test participants with damage to the left anterior frontal lobe demonstrated planning deficits (i.e., greater number of moves required for solution).

In test, participants with damage to the right anterior, and left or right posterior areas of the frontal lobes showed no impairment. The results implicating the left anterior frontal lobes involvement in solving the TOL were supported in concomitant neuroimaging studies which also showed a reduction in regional [[cerebral blood flow]] to the left pre-frontal lobe. For the number of moves, a significant negative correlation was observed for the left prefrontal area, i.e. subjects that took more time planning their moves showed greater activation in the left prefrontal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Production equipment control''' involves production equipment that resides in the [[shop floor]] of a manufacturing company and its purpose is to produce goods of a wanted [[Quality (business)|quality]] when provided with [[production resource]]s of a required quality. In modern [[production line]]s the production equipment is fully automated using [[industrial control method]]s and involves limited [[unskilled labour]] participation. Modern production equipment consists of [[mechatronic]] modules that are integrated according to a [[control architecture]]. The most widely known architectures involve [[hierarchy]], [[polyarchy]], [[hetaerarchy]] and hybrid. The methods for achieving a [[technical effect]] are described by [[control algorithm]]s, which may or may not utilize [[formal method]]s in their design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1782">The '''refinement calculus''' is a formalized approach to stepwise [[program refinement|refinement]] for program construction. The required behaviour of the final executable program is specified as an abstract and perhaps non-executable "program", which is then refined by a series of correctness-preserving transformations into an efficiently executable program.

Proponents include [[Ralph-Johan Back]], who originated the approach in his 1978 PhD thesis ''On the Correctness of Refinement Steps in Program Development'', and [[Carroll_Morgan_(academic)|Carroll Morgan]], especially with his book ''[http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/publications/books/PfS/ Programming from Specifications]'' (Prentice Hall, 2nd edition, 1994, {{ISBN|0-13-123274-6}}). In the latter case, the motivation was to link [[Jean-Raymond Abrial|Abrial]]'s specification notation [[Z notation|Z]], via a rigorous relation of behaviour-preserving [[program refinement]], to an executable programming notation based on [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Dijkstra]]'s language of [[guarded commands]]. ''Behaviour-preserving'' in this case means that any [[Hoare triple]] satisfied by a program should also be satisfied by any refinement of it, which notion leads directly to ''[http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~mjb/refcalc-tut/home.html#morgan specification statements]'' as pre- and postconditions standing, on their own, for any program that could soundly be placed between them.

The '''Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science''' ('''RSMAS''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|z|.|m|ə|s}}) is a academic and research institution for the study of [[oceanography]] and the [[atmospheric sciences]] within the [[University of Miami]] (UM). It is located on a 16 [[acre]] (65,000 m²) campus on [[Virginia Key]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]]. It is the only subtropical applied and basic marine and atmospheric research institute in the continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underwatertimes.com/ref/ref.php|title=The Reference Desk|accessdate=February 18, 2010|publisher=UnderwaterTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marinesciencetoday.com/2009/07/17/university-roundup-rosentstiel-school-of-marine-and-atmospheric-science-at-the-university-of-miami/|publisher=Marine Science Today|title=University Roundup: Rosentstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami|accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until 2008, RSMAS was solely a [[graduate school]] within the University of Miami, while it jointly administrated an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate program]] with UM's College of Arts and Sciences. In 2008, the Rosenstiel School has taken over administrative responsibilities for the undergraduate program, granting Bachelor of Science in Marine and Atmospheric Science (BSMAS) and Bachelor of Arts in Marine Affairs (BAMA) [[baccalaureate degree]]. [[master's degree|Master's]], including a Master of [[First professional degree|Professional]] Science degree, and  [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorates]] are also awarded to RSMAS students by the UM Graduate School.&lt;ref name=mps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mps.rsmas.miami.edu/|title=Master of Professional Science - Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science - University of Miami|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.edu/gs/index.php/graduate_school/about_us/message_from_the_dean/|title=Message from the Dean {{!}} Graduate School {{!}} University of Miami|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=2011-02-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720000147/http://www.miami.edu/gs/index.php/graduate_school/about_us/message_from_the_dean/|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rosenstiel School's research includes the [[marine biology|study of marine life]], particularly ''[[Aplysia]]'' and [[coral]]; [[climate change]]; air-sea interactions; [[coastal ecology]]; and [[admiralty law]]. The school operates a marine research laboratory ship, and has a research site at an inland [[sinkhole]]. Research also includes the use of data from weather satellites and the school operates its own satellite downlink facility.

==History==
[[Image:Rosenstiel Entrance Plate.jpg|thumb|left|The sign near the entrance to RSMAS.]]

In 1940, University of Miami President Bowman Ashe recruited [[F.G. Walton Smith]], a young British marine biologist who was working in the Bahamas. Smith joined the Department of Zoology, and began organizing the development of a marine laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|title=The History of the Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=April 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525183106/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|archive-date=2011-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the Board of Trustees of the University of Miami established the Marine Laboratory for the University.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; They invited researchers and oceanographers to associate themselves with this laboratory. Its three original objectives were teaching, basic research, and applied marine research. The laboratory focused on subjects specific to the tropical environment. Initially, the Marine Lab was located in a private boathouse on an estate on Belle Isle in [[Miami Beach, Florida]]. In 1945, when the boathouse became structurally unsafe, the lab moved to a converted apartment building in [[Coral Gables, Florida]] near the main campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|title=The History of the Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science|first=Jean|last=Yehle|work=www.rsmas.miami.edu|accessdate=2011-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525183106/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|archive-date=2011-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, a delegation from [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] prompted the [[Florida State Legislature]] to support the development of a state Marine Laboratory in conjunction with the UM lab. It reported to the [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission|State Board of Conservation]], which had no marine research facility and little budget of its own at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AGQpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KMgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3195,6215129&amp;dq=florida+marine+laboratory&amp;hl=en|title=State Adds $25,000 in Tide Fight|work=Daytona Beach Morning Journal |date=January 27, 1954|page=5|quote=The Legislature appropriated $80,000 per year for research work and specified that it be paid from shell revenues.|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship lasted for 12 years until the state of Florida built the board a lab in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]. In 1953, the School's classrooms and laboratories were built at the current Virginia Key location. It was renamed the Institute of Marine Science in 1961,&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|title=Dorothy H. and Lewis Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science|url=http://www6.miami.edu/umbulletin/und/marine/index.htm|accessdate=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became part of the University of Miami's School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Semiannual Status Report NASA GRANT NGR-10-007-010|date=October 31, 1966|url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670082520_1967082520.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the institution was made into an independent school and named to honor [[Lewis Rosenstiel|Lewis and Dorothy Rosenstiel]] after a major contribution from the Rosenstiel's foundation to support progress in atmospheric and marine sciences. In 1977, the school began a joint undergraduate program with Miami's College of Arts &amp; Sciences.&lt;ref name=msc/&gt; The school bought Research vessels and built more facilities to further research projects. From 2003 to 2008, the school operated the Pew Institute for Ocean Science as a joint venture with the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]], and in 2008, the program relocated to [[SUNY at Stony Brook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aafcseafood.org/Documents/conquest_of_the_ocean.pdf|title=Conquest of the Ocean|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stony Brook Southampton Broadens Scope With Ocean Conservation Institute|url=http://www.hamptons.com/detail.php?articleID=4646|first=Kelly |last=Carroll|work=hamptons.com|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rusty trombone''' is an act in which a man stands with his knees and back slightly [[torqued]] with feet at least shoulder width apart to expose his  [[anus]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;Tate, Jordan. (January 9, 2007) The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms. Publisher [[St. Martin's Press]] {{ISBN|0-312-36298-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "player" typically kneels behind the man and performs  [[anilingus]] while reaching up beneath the [[testicle]]s or around the body to manually administer rapid up and down motions of the [[penis]], mimicking the motions of a [[trombone]] player.&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="words"&gt;Sex Dictionary.

==Usage history==
In 2003, the [[Detroit, Michigan]] talk radio show [[Deminski &amp; Doyle]] began an educational hour discussion of urban-legendary sex acts with the statement, "Try to describe carefully what a '[[Cleveland steamer]]' would be..." and then went into details of the [[blumpkin]] and the rusty trombone.&lt;ref name="shock"&gt;[[Josh Walk|Wolk, Josh]].

Section: No. 712.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen months later, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] proposed a fine of $27,500 to the station's owner, [[Infinity Broadcasting]], through a Notice of Apparent Liability (NAL)&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Communications Commission]] (April 3, 2003) ''[http://www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2003/FCC-03-71A1.html Notice of Apparent Liability (NAL).]'' ""Rusty Trombone," and again please, no kids, no women.

Rusty trombone (dirty trombone) gained wider use in entertainment projects being developed for release in 2005. For example, comedian [[Andy Dick]] used the term in the 2005 [[documentary film]] ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'' as part of the infamous [[dirty joke]] of the [[The Aristocrats (joke)|same name]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Sooke, Alastair.

In 2012, ''[[Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson|Late, Late Show]]'' host [[Craig Ferguson]] began a running gag offering guests the opportunity to play a rusty trombone. Viewers are assured that, as long as he shows the actual oxidized musical instrument, the CBS censors will not try to stop him. (March 4, 2013)

In 2013, during the final credits of ''[[Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa]]'', an extra scene shows Billy asking a mall [[Santa Claus]] for a "rusty trombone" for his grandpa. The full scene is featured in ''[[Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa .5]]''.

A '''spongivore''' is an [[animal]] anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating animals of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]], commonly called [[sea sponges]], for the main component of its diet. As a result of their diet, spongivore animals like the [[hawksbill turtle]] have developed sharp, narrow bird-like beak that allows them to reach within crevices on the reef to obtain sponges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-01|title=Hawksbill sea turtle|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hawksbill_sea_turtle&amp;oldid=828271087|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}{{Better source needed|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attacks and counter-attacks ==
[[File:Blue sponge at Coral Gardens Oudekraal DSC07978.JPG|thumb|257x257px|[[Turret sponge]], eaten by some spongivores.]]
=== Spongivore offense ===
The many defenses displayed by sponges means that their spongivores need to learn skills to overcome these defenses to obtain their food. These skills allow spongivores to increase their feeding and use of sponges. Spongivores have three primary strategies for dealing with sponge defenses: choice based on colour, able to handle secondary metabolites and brain development for memory. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wulff|first=Janie L.|date=1994|title=Sponge Feeding by Caribbean angelfishes, trunkfishes and filefish|url=http://www.bio.fsu.edu/wulff/Wulff%201994a.pdf|journal=Sponges in Time and Space|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choice based on colour was involved based on which sponge the spongivore would choose to eat. A spongivore would bite small sample of sponges and if they were unharmed that they would continue eating that specific sponge and then move on to another sponge of the same colour. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Spongivores have adopted to be able to handle the [[secondary metabolite]]s that sponges have. Therefore, spongivores are able to consume a variety of sponges without getting harmed. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Spongivores also have enough brain development to be able to remember the same species of sponge it has eaten in the past and will continue to eat in the future. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sponge defense ===
[[File:Demospongiae morphology and spicule diversity.png |thumb|Sponge spicule]]
A sponge defense is a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] that increases a sponge [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] when faced with a spongivore. This is measured relative to another sponge that lacks the defensive trait. Sponge

defenses increase survival and/or reproduction (fitness) of sponges under pressure of predation from spongivore. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-08|title=Fitness (biology)|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fitness_(biology)&amp;oldid=829456081|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of structural and chemical strategies found in sponges are used to deter predation. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hill, M., Lopez, N., &amp; Young, K. (2005). Anti-predator defenses in western North Atlantic sponges with evidence of enhanced defense through interactions between spicules and chemicals. ''Marine Ecology Progress Series,'' ''291'', 93-102. doi:10.3354/meps291093&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common structural strategies that sponges have that prevents them from being consumed by predators is by having [[Sponge spicule|spicules]]. If a sponge contains spicules along with organic compounds, the likelihood of those sponges being consumed by spongivores decrease. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sponges have also developed [[aposematism]] to help avoid predation. Spongivores have learned four things about sponges aposematism and they are as follows:
# If it is poison some predators will not eat it
# If It is conspicuously coloured, or advertises itself by means of some other signals;
# Some predators avoid attacking it because of its signals
# These conspicuous signals provide better protection to the individual or to its genes than would other (e.g. cryptic) signals. &lt;ref&gt;Pawlik, J., Chanas, B., Toonen, R., &amp; Fenical, W. (1995). Defenses of Caribbean sponges against predatory reef fish. I. Chemical deterrency. ''Marine Ecology Progress Series,'' ''127'', 183-194. doi:10.3354/meps127183&lt;/ref&gt;
Unfortunately, sponges that live in the deep sea are not at an advantage due to the colour because most colour in the deep sea is lost. &lt;ref&gt;Pinet, P. R. (2016). ''Invitation to oceanography''. Burlington, MA: Jones et Bartlett Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts ==
Sponges play an important role in the benthic fauna throughout temperate, tropical and polar habitats. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bell, J. J. (2008). The functional roles of marine sponges. ''Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science,'' ''79''(3), 341-353. doi:10.1016/j.ecss.2008.05.002&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a high volume of predation it can effect [[Bioerosion|bio erosion]], reef creation, multiple habitats, other species and help with the nitrogen levels.

Bio erosion that occurs in the production of reef sediments and the structural component of corals are partly produced by sponges, where solid carbonate is processed into smaller fragments and fine sediments. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sponges also play a role in increasing the survival of live coral on Caribbean reefs by binding fragments together and is expected to increase the rates of carbonate accretion. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The coral reefs that contain higher amounts of sponges have better survival rate than the reefs with fewer sponges. Sponges can act as a stabilizer during storms as they help keep the reefs intact when presented with a strong currents. Sponges also grown between rocks and boulders, providing a more stable environment and lowering the disturbance levels. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sponges also provide habitats for other organisms to live in, without them, these organisms would not have a protected habitat.

Scientist have discovered that sponges play an important role in the nitrogen cycle. There are low amounts of nitrogen found in the water around coral reefs and most of the nitrogen that is found it bound into particulate or dissolved organic matter. Before this dissolved organic matter is able to be used by other reef organisms it must undergo a series of microbial transformations. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The nitrogen cycle that occurs in sponges are able to cycle the nitrogen back into the water column and can be used by other organisms, especially the cyanobacteria.The cyanobacteria then can then fix the atmospheric nitrogen and then the sponges can use it. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore, if there is a high amount of spongivores present in an environment, it can effect other aspects of the environment besides sponges.

'''''Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik''''' is a book on the history of [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] by the Austrian [[art history|art historian]] [[Alois Riegl]]. It was published in [[Berlin]] in 1893. The English translation renders the title as ''Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament'', although this has been criticized by some.{{efn|For example, Benjamin Binstock, "Alois Riegl, Monumental Ruin," in A. Riegl, ''Historical Grammar of the Visual Arts'' (New York, 2004), p.35 n.28: "Evelyn Kain's translation of what she strangely calls ''Problems of Style'' is unsatisfactory; it is not simply a question (or problem) of style." See also Kathryn Brush's review of the translation, ''Art Bulletin'' 74 (1994), p. 355: "Riegl wrote ''Stilfragen'', or ''Questions of style'' (curiously entitled ''Problems of Style'' in the 1992 English translation) during the 1890s...."}} It has been called "the one great book ever written about the history of ornament."&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Gombrich, ''The sense of order'' (London, 1984), 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riegl wrote the ''Stilfragen'' while employed as director of the textile department at what was then the Österreichisches Museum für Kunst und Industrie (today the [[Museum für angewandte Kunst Wien|Museum für angewandte Kunst]]) in [[Vienna]]. His primary intention was to argue that it was possible to write a continuous history of ornament. This position is argued in explicit opposition to that of the "technical-materialist" school, according to which "all art forms were always the direct products of materials and techniques"&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and that ornamental "motifs originated spontaneously throughout the world at a number of different locations."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Riegl associates this view with the followers of [[Gottfried Semper]], who had advanced a related argument in his ''Der Stil in den technischen Künsten; oder praktischer Ästhetik'' (''Style in the technical arts; or practical [[aesthetics]]'', 1878-79). However, Riegl consistently disassociates Semper's followers from Semper himself, writing that

{{quote|The theory of the technical, materialist origin of the earliest ornaments is usually attributed to Gottfried Semper. This association is, however, no more justified than the one made between contemporary Darwinism and Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the technical-materialist position had attained the status of dogma, Riegl stated that "the most pressing problem that confronts historians of the decorative arts today is to reintegrate the historical thread that has been served into a thousand pieces."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, he argued for a continuous development of ornament from ancient Egyptian through Greek and Roman and up to early Islamic and, eventually, Ottoman art.

The ''Stilfragen'' is divided into an introduction, which sets out the purpose of the work, and four chapters, each on a theme in the history of artistic style.

The first chapter, "The Geometric Style," argues that geometric ornament originated, not from such technical processes as wickerwork and weaving, but rather from an "immanent artistic drive, alert and restless for action, that human beings possessed long before they invented woven protective coverings for their bodies."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported this position through an analysis of geometric ornament in [[Stone Age]] European art, in particular objects that had recently been discovered in the [[Dordogne]]. This ornament, he argued, developed from attempts to represent natural forms in two dimensions, which gave rise to the idea of an outline. After this "invention of line," the cave-dwellers proceeded to arrange lines "according to the principles of rhythm and symmetry."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chapter, "The Heraldic Style," addresses compositions of "paired animals arranged symmetrically to either side of an intervening central element."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of decoration had been associated by previous scholars, most notably [[Ernst Curtius]], with the technical demands of [[silk]]-weaving. Riegl argued instead that heraldic ornament arose before the invention of mechanical weaving-looms, and stemmed from a desire for symmetry.

The third chapter, "The Introduction of Vegetal Ornament and the Development of the Ornamental Tendril," traces an unbroken evolution of vegetal ornament from ancient Egyptian through to late [[Roman art]]. Here Riegl argues that motifs such as the [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flower]], although they may originally have been endowed by the Egyptians with symbolic significance, were adopted by other cultures that "no longer understood their hieratic meaning,"&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby became purely decorative. In the most famous section of this chapter, Riegl argued that [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus ornament]] was not derived from the [[Acanthus (genus)|acanthus plant]], as had been believed since the time of [[Vitruvius]], but was rather a sculptural adaptation of the [[palmette]] motif. It was therefore "a product of pure artistic invention,"&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; and not of "a simple compulsion to make direct copies of living organisms."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth chapter, "The [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]]," continues the development of the previous chapter through late antique and early [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and into [[Islamic art]]. The arabesque is  understood here as a geometricized version of earlier systems of tendril ornament, thereby establishing a "genetic relationship between the ornamental Islamic tendril and its direct predecessor, the tendril ornament of antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 229.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The final two chapters are therefore presented as a continuous history of vegetal ornament from ancient Egypt through to Ottoman Turkey, in which individual motifs develop according to purely artistic criteria, and not through the intervention of technical or mimetic concerns. In the introduction it is suggested that this development could be continued to Riegl's own time, and that "ornament experiences the same continuous, coherent development that prevails in the art of all periods."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

The ''Stilfragen'' remains a fundamental work in the history of ornament, and has heavily influenced the work of [[Paul Jacobsthal]] and [[Ernst Gombrich]], among others who have addressed the same themes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jessica Rawson|Rawson, Jessica]], ''Chinese Ornament: The Lotus and the Dragon'', pp. 24-25, 1984, British Museum Publications, {{ISBN|0714114316}}. Rawson's Appendix, pp. 199-222, summarizes the early history of flower ornament around the Mediterranean: "Details of the present description differ from Riegl's analysis; however the general outline proposed follows his fascinating account" (p. 199)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Riegl's work as a whole, the ''Stilfragen'' constitutes his earliest general statement of principles, although his "theoretical thinking had not by any means reached maturity."&lt;ref&gt;Henri Zerner, "Preface," ''Problems of style'', xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; By severing stylistic development from external influences, such as technical procedures or a desire to imitate nature, Riegl raised an extremely complicated set of questions regarding the actual source and significance of stylistic change. As [[Otto Pächt]] has written:

{{quote|In the picture that Riegl draws of the development the changes of style are meaningful in a specific way; continuity is not merely carrying on; every stylistic phase creates its own problems which are solved in the succeeding one, only to create new conflicts for which new answers have to be found. Thus the styles change of necessity, or to put it differently: in a kind of 'retrospective prophecy' the art historian shows that artistic development was compelled to move in the direction in which in fact it did. A view with most serious implications. One of them was that if one viewed art history in this way, absolute aesthetic norms became obsolete and had to be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Pächt, "Art historians and art critics, vi: Alois Riegl," ''The Burlington Magazine'' 105 (1963), 189.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus the concerns of the ''Stilfragen'' led directly into those of Riegl's next major study, the ''Spätrömische Kunstindustrie'' (''Late Roman art industry'', 1901), in which he approached style change in [[late antiquity]] not as a symptom of decline, but as the result of positive artistic concerns.

{{About|the interdisciplinary field|the analysis of systems in electrical engineering|system analysis}}
The [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary defines '''system analysis''' as "the process of studying a procedure or [[business]] in order to identify its goals and purposes and create [[system]]s and procedures that will achieve them in an efficient way". Another view sees system analysis as a [[problem-solving]] technique that breaks down a system into its component pieces for the purpose of the studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Analysis-Design-Global-Enterprise/dp/0071107665 System Analysis and Design for the Global Enterprise] by Lonnie D. Bentley p.160 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of system analysis relates closely to [[Requirement analysis|requirements analysis]] or to [[operations research]]. It is also "an explicit formal inquiry carried out to help a [[decision maker]] identify a better course of action and make a better decision than she might otherwise have made."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070822025602/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/SYSTEM_ANALY.html SYSTEMS ANALYSIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms [[wiktionary:analysis|analysis]] and [[wiktionary:synthesis|synthesis]] stem from Greek, meaning "to take apart" and "to put together," respectively. These terms are used in many [[scientific discipline]]s, from mathematics and logic to economics and psychology, to denote similar investigative procedures. Analysis is defined as "the procedure by which we break down an intellectual or substantial whole into parts," while synthesis means "the procedure by which we combine separate elements or components in order to form a coherent whole." &lt;ref&gt;Tom Ritchey, [http://www.swemorph.com/pdf/anaeng-r.pdf  Analysis and Synthesis.]&lt;/ref&gt; System analysis researchers apply [[methodology]] to the systems involved, forming an overall picture.

System analysis is used in every field where something is developed. Analysis can also be a series of components that perform organic functions together, such as system engineering. [[System engineering]] is an [[interdisciplinary field]] of engineering that focuses on how complex engineering projects should be designed and managed.

==Information technology==
The development of a computer-based information system includes a system analysis phase. This helps produce the [[data model]], a precursor to creating or enhancing a [[database]]. There are a number of different approaches to system analysis. When a computer-based information system is developed, system analysis (according to the [[Waterfall model]]) would constitute the following steps:

* The development of a feasibility study: determining whether a project is economically, socially, technologically and organizationally feasible
* Fact-finding measures, designed to ascertain the requirements of the system's end-users (typically involving interviews, questionnaires, or visual observations of work on the existing system)
* Gauging how the end-users would operate the system (in terms of general experience in using computer hardware or software), what the system would be used for and so on

Another view outlines a phased approach to the process. This  approach breaks system analysis into 5 phases:

* Scope Definition: Clearly defined objectives and requirements necessary to meet a project's requirements as defined by its stakeholders
* Problem analysis: the process of understanding problems and needs and arriving at solutions that meet them
* Requirements analysis: determining the conditions that need to be met
* Logical design: looking at the logical relationship among the objects
* Decision analysis: making a final decision
 
[[Use case]]s are widely used system analysis modeling tools for identifying and expressing the functional requirements of a system. Each use case is a business scenario or event for which the system must provide a defined response. Use cases evolved from object-oriented analysis.

==Policy analysis==
The discipline of what is today known as [[policy analysis]] originated from the application of system analysis when it was first instituted by United States [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]].{{cn|date=April 2016}}

==Practitioners==
Practitioners of system analysis are often called up to dissect systems that have grown haphazardly to determine the current components of the system. This was shown during the year 2000 re-engineering effort as business and manufacturing processes were examined as part of the [[Y2K]] automation upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;Géza HUSI: Mechatronics Control Systems&lt;/ref&gt; Employment utilizing system analysis include [[system analyst]], [[business analyst]], [[Industrial engineering|manufacturing engineer]], [[system architect]], [[enterprise architect]], [[software architect]], etc.

While practitioners of system analysis can be called upon to create new systems, they often modify, expand or document existing systems ([[Process (engineering)|processes]], [[Procedure (term)|procedures]] and [[Methodology|methods]]). Researchers and practitioners rely on system analysis. Activity system analysis has been already applied to various research and practice studies including business management, educational reform, educational technology, etc.

'''''The Burlington Magazine''''' is a monthly publication that covers the [[fine art|fine]] and [[decorative arts]]. Established in 1903, it is the longest running art journal in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;T. Fawcett, 'Scholarly Journals', in: ''The Art Press – Two Centuries of Art Magazines'', London, 1976, pp. 3–10, {{ISBN|0-905309-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been published by a [[charitable organisation]] since 1986.

==History==
The magazine was established in 1903 by a group of art historians and connoisseurs which included [[Roger Fry]], [[Herbert Horne]], [[Bernard Berenson]], and [[Charles Holmes]]. Its most esteemed editors &lt;ref&gt;H. Rees Leahy. 'For Connoisseurs: The Burlington Magazine', in: ''Art History and its institutions'', London and New York, 2002, pp. 231–245&lt;/ref&gt; have been [[Roger Fry|Fry]] (1909–19), [[Herbert Read]] (1933–39), and [[Benedict Nicolson]] (1948–78).  The journal's structure was loosely based on its contemporary British publication ''[[The Connoisseur (magazine)|The Connoisseur]]'', which was mainly aimed at collectors and had firm connections with the art trade. ''The Burlington Magazine'', however, added to this late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] tradition of market-based criticism new elements of historical research inspired by the leading academic German periodicals and thus created a formula that has remained almost intact to date: a combination of archival and formalist object-based art historical research juxtaposed to articles on collectors’ items and private collections, enlivened with notes on current art news, exhibitions and sales.&lt;ref&gt;A. Burton, 'Nineteenth Century Periodicals', in: ''The Art Press – Two Centuries of Art Magazines'', London, 1976, pp. 3–10, {{ISBN|0-905309-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lavishness of this publication almost immediately created financial troubles and in January 1905&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Denys, Select Chronology--'Letters of Roger Fry ' ,Chatto and Windus, London, 1972 {{ISBN|0701115998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry embarked on an American tour to find sponsorship to assure the survival of the journal,&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Holmes, ''Self and partners (Mostly self)'', London, 1936, pp. 213–34, {{ISBN|1-4067-6927-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he had quickly recognized as a magazine for the developing study of art history.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Denys Introduction-'Letters of Roger Fry', Chatto and Windus,London, 1972 {{ISBN|0701115998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
From its first editorial, ''The Burlington Magazine'' presented itself as synthesising opposing traditions – historicist versus aestheticism and academic versus commercial – by defining itself an exponent of "Austere Epicureanism".&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, ‘Editorial Article’, ''The Burlington Magazine'', 1 (March 1903), pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; Against the perceived "sameness" of the contemporary art panorama, ''The Burlington Magazine'' was to act as a disinterested guide, directing the public's attention to high-quality art on offer both on the market and on institutional settings and educating its readers on the elevating qualities of ancient art.&lt;ref&gt;A. Helmreich, ‘The Death of the Victorian Art Periodical’, ''Visual Resources'', 26, no. 3, (September 2010), pp. 242–253&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Burlington Magazine'' editors and contributors were part of the institutional sphere of museums and academia and yet, unlike their German counterparts, they participated in the emerging world of the commercial galleries.&lt;ref&gt;T. Fawcett, 'Scholarly Journals', in: ''The Art Press – Two Centuries of Art Magazines'', London, 1976, pp. 3–10, {{ISBN|0-905309-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine remained independent from any institution and yet it was instrumental in the establishment of academic art history in Britain: its [[dialectical]] dynamic between market and institution contributed to the creation of an original and multifaceted publication.&lt;ref&gt;B. Pezzini, 'An open resource for scholars and a primary source for research: the Burlington Magazine online index', ''Art Libraries Journal'',36, no. 3, (June 2011), pp.46–51&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Burlington Magazine'' was founded as a journal of ancient art but already in its first decade, especially under the editorship of Fry articles on modern art became prominent. Topics covered in detail were: [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Post-Impressionism]] in a debate between Fry and [[Dugald Sutherland MacColl|D. S. MacColl]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Shiff: ''Cézanne and the End of Impressionism'', Chicago, 1984, pp. 143–152&lt;/ref&gt; a debate on a bust of Flora ascribed to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and later discovered to be a forgery, and the role of archival research in the art historical reconstruction, with contributions by [[Herbert Horne]] and Constance Jocelyn Ffoulkes.

''The Burlington Magazine'', especially in its first decades, was also preoccupied with the definition and development of [[formal analysis]] and [[connoisseurship]] in the visual arts and consistently observed, reviewed and contributed to the body of attributions to various artists, notably [[Rembrandt]], [[Poussin]], and [[Caravaggio]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Nicolson, 'The Burlington Magazine', ''Connoisseur'', 191 (March 1976), pp. 180–183&lt;/ref&gt; The journal had also many notable contributions by visual artists on other artists, notably [[Walter Sickert]] on [[Edgar Degas]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Sickert, 'Degas', ''The Burlington Magazine'', 31 (November 1917), pp. 193–191&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The journal is published monthly, and features a cross-section of writers.

The first issues of ''The Burlington Magazine'' were printed on high-quality paper, had a typeface designed by Herbert Horne and were richly illustrated with black and white photographs, many by the arts and crafts photographer [[Emery Walker]].

The original paper has been cited over 2000 times.

== Background ==
The three dimensional structure of biological macromolecules like [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s play critical role in determining their functional role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Introduction to Protein Structure|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0307441292901326|journal = Biochemical Education|volume = 20|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/0307-4412(92)90132-6|first = F.|last = Vella|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of decoding function from the sequence is an experimentally and computationally challenging question addressed widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prediction of protein function from protein sequence and structure|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0033583503003901|journal = Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics|date = 2003-08-01|issn = 1469-8994|pages = 307–340|volume = 36|issue = 03|doi = 10.1017/S0033583503003901|first = James C.|last = Whisstock|first2 = Arthur M.|last2 = Lesk|pmid=15029827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Predicting protein function from sequence and structure|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrm2281|journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|pages = 995–1005|volume = 8|issue = 12|doi = 10.1038/nrm2281|first = David|last = Lee|first2 = Oliver|last2 = Redfern|first3 = Christine|last3 = Orengo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RNA]] structures form complex secondary and [[RNA Structure|tertiary structures]] compared to [[DNA]] which form [[Nucleic acid double helix|duplexes]] with full [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementarity]] between two strands. This is partially because the extra oxygen in RNA increases the propensity for hydrogen bonding in the nucleic acid backbone. The [[base pairing]] and [[base stacking]] interactions of RNA play critical role in formation of [[ribosome]], [[spliceosome]], or [[tRNA]].

[[Nucleic_acid_structure|Secondary structure]] prediction is commonly done using approaches like dynamic programming, energy minimisation (for most stable structure) and generating suboptimal structures. A large number of [[List_of_RNA_structure_prediction_software|structure prediction tools]] have been implemented as well.

== Development ==
The first version of the ViennaRNA Package was published by Hofacker et al. in 1994.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The package distributed tools to compute either minimum free energy structures or partition functions of RNA molecules; both using the idea of [[dynamic programming]]. Non-thermodynamic criterion like formation of maximum matching or various versions of kinetic folding along with an inverse folding heuristic to determine structurally neutral sequences were implemented. Additionally, the package also contained a statistics suite with routines for [[cluster analysis]], statistical geometry, and split decomposition.

The package was made available as library and a set of standalone routines.

=== Version 2.0 ===
A number of major systemic changes were introduced in this version with the use of a new parametrized energy model (''Turner 2004''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Incorporating chemical modification constraints into a dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of RNA secondary structure|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/101/19/7287|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2004-05-11|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 409911|pmid = 15123812|pages = 7287–7292|volume = 101|issue = 19|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0401799101|first = David H.|last = Mathews|first2 = Matthew D.|last2 = Disney|first3 = Jessica L.|last3 = Childs|first4 = Susan J.|last4 = Schroeder|first5 = Michael|last5 = Zuker|first6 = Douglas H.|last6 = Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt; restructuring of the RNAlib to support concurrent computations in thread-safe manner, improvements to the [[Application programming interface|API]], and inclusion of several new auxiliary tools. For example, tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles of structures. Furthermore, other features included additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures derived from base pairing probabilities, or ''z-scores'' for locally stable secondary structures, and support for input in [[FASTA]] format. The updates, however, are compatible with earlier versions without affecting the computational efficiency of the core algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = ViennaRNA Package 2.0|url = http://www.almob.org/content/6/1/26|journal = Algorithms for Molecular Biology|date = 2011-11-24|pmc = 3319429|pmid = 22115189|volume = 6|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/1748-7188-6-26|first = Ronny|last = Lorenz|first2 = Stephan H|last2 = Bernhart|first3 = Christian Höner zu|last3 = Siederdissen|first4 = Hakim|last4 = Tafer|first5 = Christoph|last5 = Flamm|first6 = Peter F|last6 = Stadler|first7 = Ivo L|last7 = Hofacker|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Web server ===
The tools provided by the ViennaRNA Package are also available for public use through a web interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Vienna RNA Websuite|url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/suppl_2/W70|journal = Nucleic Acids Research|date = 2008-07-01|issn = 0305-1048|pmc = 2447809|pmid = 18424795|pages = W70-W74|volume = 36|issue = suppl 2|doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn188|first = Andreas R.|last = Gruber|first2 = Ronny|last2 = Lorenz|first3 = Stephan H.|last3 = Bernhart|first4 = Richard|last4 = Neuböck|first5 = Ivo L.|last5 = Hofacker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Vienna RNA secondary structure server|url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/13/3429|journal = Nucleic Acids Research|date = 2003-07-01|issn = 0305-1048|pmid = 12824340|pages = 3429–3431|volume = 31|issue = 13|doi = 10.1093/nar/gkg599|first = Ivo L.|last = Hofacker|pmc=169005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
In addition to prediction and analysis tools, the ViennaRNA Package contains several scripts and utilities for plotting and input-output processing. A summary of the available programs is collected in the table below (an exhaustive list with examples can be found in the official documentation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TBI - ViennaRNA Package 2|url = http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/documentation.html|website = www.tbi.univie.ac.at|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
