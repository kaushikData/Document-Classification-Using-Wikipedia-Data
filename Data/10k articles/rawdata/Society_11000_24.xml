'''Anton Julian Ferdinand''' (born 18 February 1985) is an English [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]]. He was a product of the [[West Ham United F.C. Reserves and Academy|West Ham United academy]] and has also played for their [[West Ham United F.C.|senior team]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Bursaspor]], [[Antalyaspor]] and [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. He has also played for England at [[England under-21 national football team|under-21 level]].

==Background==
Ferdinand was born in [[Peckham]], London, to Janice from [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and Julian from [[Saint Lucia]].&lt;ref name=Origins&gt;{{cite book|last=Belton|first=Brian|title=The Black Hammers|year=2006|publisher=Pennant  Books|location=Hove|isbn=0-9550394-5-2|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His brother, [[Rio Ferdinand|Rio]], played for Queens Park Rangers and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and is a former captain of the [[England national football team]]; and his cousin, [[Les Ferdinand|Les]], is a former England international.&lt;ref name="cousins"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/queens-park-rangers/8860484/Anton-Ferdinand-racism-row-with-John-Terry-timeline.html | title=Anton Ferdinand racism row with John Terry: timeline |work=The Daily Telegraph  | date=31 October 2011 | accessdate=3 November 2011 | author=Tyers,Alan | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anton showed considerable talent from an early age. Like his brother, Rio, he preferred to play in [[Defender (association football)|defence]]. His ability in this position led to him being signed to West Ham United's [[The Academy of Football|academy]].

==Club career==

===West Ham United===
Ferdinand joined West Ham aged nine&lt;ref name=442af&gt;{{cite web|title=Anton Ferdinand|url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/boysabitspecial/385/article.aspx|publisher=www.fourfourtwo.com|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; signing a three-year contract in the summer of 2002.&lt;ref name=2002Contact&gt;{{cite news|title=Anton his own man|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/2164712.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=9 July 2012|first=Kevin|last=Darling|date=7 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was handed his [[first team]] debut, by manager [[Glenn Roeder]], in August 2003 when he started the 2–1 victory at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] season's opening day.&lt;ref name=whudebut&gt;{{cite news|title=Connolly fires a warning to Roeder|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2409177/Connolly-fires-a-warning-to-Roeder.html|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=www.dailytelegraph.co.uk|date=10 August 2003|location=London|first=Patrick|last=Barclay}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to feature in 26 games that season.&lt;ref name=whustats&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics&amp;nbsp;– Anton Ferdinand|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=772&amp;united=Anton_Ferdinand|publisher=www.westhamstats.info|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anton and Rio Ferdinand with West Ham United.jpg|thumb|left|200|Anton with brother Rio in a West Ham testimonial match]]
In the [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] season, he cemented his first team place with several key performances including scoring the opening goal, and his first for West Ham, on the final day of the season as West Ham beat [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] 2–1 at [[Vicarage Road]] to make the [[2004–05 Football League Championship#Play-offs|play-offs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pryce|first=Robert|title=Hammers set up thriller sequel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/may/09/match.watford|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=www.guardian.co.uk|date=9 May 2005|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Soccerbase season|34292|2004|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[2005 Football League Championship play-off Final|Final]] Ferdinand was a member of the team which beat Preston 1–0, earning them promotion back into the [[Premier League]] after an absence of two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/may/31/match.westhamunited | title=Zamora strikes gold for Hammers | publisher=www.guardian.co.uk | date=31 May 2005 | accessdate=9 July 2012 | author=Scott,Matt | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of July 2005, Ferdinand signed a three-year contract extension with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/4731629.stm|title=Ferdinand signs new West Ham deal|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014|work=BBC News|date=30 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferdinand won the [[Premier League Player of the Month]] award in January 2006 following his brother Rio to become the first brothers to win the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20060210/anton-wins-barclays-player-of-the-month-award_2236884_1141250 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209090427/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20060210/anton-wins-barclays-player-of-the-month-award_2236884_1141250 | dead-url=yes | archivedate=9 February 2013 | title=Anton wins Barclays Player of the Month award | publisher=www.whufc.com | date=2 February 2006 | accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2006 FA Cup Final]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in Cardiff, Ferdinand fell to his knees after missing the decisive penalty in the shoot out.&lt;ref name="2006fa"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2006/05/15/beaten-only-on-penalties-don-t-ever-say-these-heroic-hammers-are-just-losers-115875-17078687/ | title=Beaten only on penalties, don't ever say these heroic Hammers are just losers | publisher=Trinity Mirror|work=Daily Mirror  | date=15 May 2006 | accessdate=3 November 2011 | first=Oliver|last=Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007 it was revealed that Ferdinand had been fined two weeks' wages (estimated at £45,000) for lying about his whereabouts. Ferdinand told the club he needed to go to the [[Isle of Wight]] to visit his grandmother when in fact, he went to [[South Carolina]] to celebrate his 22nd birthday. West Ham lost the following game to relegation rivals [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] 0–4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2002390000-2007120462,00.html "Anton suffers Hammers shame"]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}, ''The Sun'', 16 March 2007. Retrieved 10 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His last goal for West Ham was against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 12 January 2008, scoring in the 69th minute to put West Ham 2–1 ahead, which proved to be the winning goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7172826.stm | title=West Ham 2–1 Fulham | publisher=BBC Sport | date=12 January 2008 | accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferdinand fell out of favour with new manager [[Steve Bruce]] and first team opportunities became limited and he was not initially given a squad number for the 2010–11 Premier League season as loan-signing [[John Mensah]] was given Ferdinand's number 5 shirt, but was later given number 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Sunderland shirt number for outcast Ferdinand |url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/no-sunderland-shirt-number-outcast-ferdinand-1044391 |date=14 August 2010 |work=tribalfootball.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817182105/http://www.tribalfootball.com/no-sunderland-shirt-number-outcast-ferdinand-1044391 |archivedate=17 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brooklyn Museum 82.154.2 Housepost One of Pair.jpg|thumbnail|Yoruba Veranda Posts, Brooklyn Museum]]

'''Ase''' or '''ashe''' (from the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''às̩e̩'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseire.com/meaning.php|title=What Is Ase Ire?|publisher=Ase Ire.com |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[African philosophy#West Africa|West African philosophical concept]] through which the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of [[Nigeria]] conceive the power to make things happen and produce change. It is given by [[Olodumare]] to everything — gods, [[Ancestor|ancestors]], spirits, humans, animals, plants, rocks, rivers, and voiced words such as songs, prayers, praises, curses, or even everyday conversation. Existence, according to Yoruba thought, is dependent upon it.&lt;ref name=Drewal&gt;{{cite book|last=Drewal|first=H. J., and J. Pemberton III with Rowland Abiodun|title=Yoruba: Nine Centuries of African Art and Thought|year=1989|publisher=The Center for African Art|location=New York City|editor=Allen Wardwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its sacred characteristics, ''ase'' also has important social ramifications, reflected in its translation as "power, authority, command." A person who, through training, experience, and initiation, learns how to use the essential life force of things to willfully effect change is called an ''alaase''.

Rituals to invoke divine forces reflect this same concern for the autonomous ''ase'' of particular entities. The recognition of the uniqueness and autonomy of the ''ase'' of persons and gods is what structures society and its relationship with the other-world.&lt;ref name=Drewal /&gt;

==Ase and Yoruba Art==
The concept of ''ase'' influences how many of the Yoruba arts are composed. In the visual arts, a design may be segmented or seriate - a "discontinuous aggregate in which the units of the whole are discrete and share equal value with the other units."&lt;ref name="Drewal 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drewal|first=M. T., and H. J. Drewal|title=Composing Time and Space in Yoruba Art|journal=Word and Image: A Journal of Verbal/Visual Enquiry|year=1987|volume=3|issue=3|pages=225–251|doi=10.1080/02666286.1987.10435383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such elements can be seen in [[Ifá]] trays and bowls, veranda posts, carved doors, and [[Traditional African masks#Ancestors masks (masks of the dead)|ancestral masks]].

Regarding composition in Yoruba art as a reflection of the concept of ''ase'', Drewal writes:

{{quote|text=Units often have no prescribed order and are interchangeable. Attention to the discrete units of the whole produces a form which is multifocal, with shifts in perspective and proportion... Such compositions (whether representational or not) mirror a world order of structurally different yet autonomous elements. It is a formal means of organizing diverse powers, not only to acknowledge their autonomy but, more importantly, to evoke, invoke, and activate diverse forces, to marshal and bring them in to the phenomenal world. The significance of segmented composition in Yoruba art can be appreciated if one understands that art and ritual are integral to each other.&lt;ref name=Drewal /&gt;}}

==The head as the site of ase==
The head, or ''ori'', is vested with great importance in [[Yoruba art]] and thought. When portrayed in sculpture, the size of the head is often represented as four or five times its normal size in relation to the body in order to convey that it is the site of a person's ''ase'' as well as his or her essential nature, or ''iwa''.&lt;ref name=Drewal /&gt; The Yoruba distinguish between the exterior (''ode'') and inner (''inu'') head. ''Ode'' is the physical appearance of a person, which may either mask or reveal one's inner (''inu'') aspects. Inner qualities, such as patience and self-control, should dominate outer ones.

The head also links the person with the other-world. The ''[[Amorites|imori]]'' ceremony (which translates to ''knowing-the-head'') is the first rite that is performed after a Yoruba child is born. During ''imori'', a diviner determines whether the child comes from his or her mother's or father's lineages or from a particular ''orisa''. If the latter is the case, then the child will undergo an orisa initiation during adulthood, during which the person's ''ori inu'' becomes the spiritual vessel for that orisa's ''ase''. To prepare for these ceremonies, the person's head is shaved, bathed and anointed.&lt;ref name=Drewal /&gt;

The '''Bangi language''', or '''''Bobangi''''', is a relative and main lexical source of [[Lingala]] spoken in central [[Africa]]. Dialects of the language are spoken on both sides of the [[Ubangi River]] and [[Congo River]].

== Use in trade ==
As the Bobangi people came to dominate the slave trade along the upper [[Congo River]] in the late 18th century, the Bangi language was used to facilitate trade between different ethnic groups in the region. Linguist John Whitehead claimed that the Moye, [[Likuba language|Likuba]], Bonga, [[Mpama people|Mpama]], Lusakani, and [[Bangala language|Bangala]] peoples all used Bangi for intercommunication in the 1890s. Traders in the region who did not speak Bangi used a trade trade language that borrowed heavily from Bangi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=River of Wealth, River of Sorrow: The Central Zaire Basin in the Era of the Slave and Ivory Trade, 1500-1891|last=Harns|first=Robert W.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1981|isbn=0300026161|location=New Haven|pages=92-93}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of indigenous trade along the upper river, the Bobangi dominated the 500 kilometer section of the Congo between the [[Kwah River]] and the equator, which most river trade passed through.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=River of Wealth, River of Sorrow|last=Harms|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ethnic groups in this area were either assimilated into the Bobangi ethnic alliance, adopting the Bangi language, or were driven off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=River of Wealth, River of Sorrow|last=Harms|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=129-130}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bobangi dominance over trade was ended by Europeans in the late 19th century when colonial powers pushed local indigenous groups out of profitable trade. By the late twentieth century, there were very few Bobangi people remaining in the area they had controlled a century earlier, and the Bangi language is no longer widespread.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Barry Jay Minkow''' (born March 22, 1966)&lt;ref name="californiabirthindex.org"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/barry_j_minkow_born_1966_9624078| title=The Birth of Barry Minkow| publisher=California Birth Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former American businessman, pastor, and convicted felon.  While still in high school, he founded '''ZZZZ Best''' (pronounced "Zee Best"), which appeared to be an immensely successful carpet-cleaning and restoration company.  However, it was actually a front to attract investment for a massive [[Ponzi scheme]].  It collapsed in 1987, costing investors and lenders $100 million—one of the largest investment frauds ever perpetrated by a single person, as well as one of the largest [[accounting scandals|accounting frauds]] in history.  The scheme is often used as a case study of accounting fraud.

After being released from jail, Minkow became a pastor and fraud investigator in [[San Diego]], and spoke at schools about ethics. This all came to an end in 2011, when he admitted to helping deliberately drive down the stock price of homebuilder [[Lennar]] and was ordered back to prison for five years.  Three years later he admitted to defrauding his own church and was sentenced to an additional five years in prison.  As a result of his crimes, he faces having to pay a total of $612 million in [[restitution]]—an amount that he will likely spend the rest of his life repaying.

==Beginnings of ZZZZ Best==
Minkow was born in [[Inglewood, California]] to a Jewish family, and was raised in the [[Reseda, Los Angeles|Reseda]] area of [[Los Angeles]]. When he was nine years old, his mother got him a job as a telemarketer with the carpet-cleaning business where she worked. At the age of 15, while a sophomore at [[Cleveland High School (Los Angeles, California)|Cleveland High School]], Minkow started ZZZZ Best in his parents' garage with three employees and four phones. In the early days, he had to rely on friends to drive him to jobs since he did not have a driver's license.&lt;ref name=LAT1&gt;Miller, Alan C. [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-19/local/me-37107_1_barry-minkow Barry Minkow--His Dream Born in a Garage Turns Sour].  [[Los Angeles Times]], 1988-01-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, Minkow struggled to meet basic expenses. Two banks closed his business account because California law did not allow minors to sign binding contracts, including checks. He was also plagued by customer complaints and demands for payment from suppliers. At times, he found it difficult even to meet payroll. Faced with a shortage of operating capital, he financed his business via [[check kiting]], stealing and selling his grandmother's jewelry, staging break-ins at his offices, and running up [[credit card fraud|fraudulent credit card charges]].&lt;ref name=CleanSweep&gt;{{cite book |title=Clean Sweep: The Inside Story of the ZZZZ Best Scam: One of Wall Street's Greatest Frauds |last=Minkow |first=Barry |authorlink=Barry Minkow |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=[[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=0-7852-7916-4 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, Minkow branched into the "insurance restoration" business. With the help of Tom Padgett, an insurance claims adjuster, Minkow forged numerous documents claiming that ZZZZ Best was involved in several restoration projects for Padgett's company. Padgett and Minkow formed a fake company, Interstate Appraisal Services, that verified the details of these restorations to Minkow's bankers. Flush with loans from these banks, Minkow expanded ZZZZ Best across Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fool.co.uk/news/investing/2009/11/02/famous-scams-zzzz-best.aspx Famous Scams: ZZZZ Best]. [[The Motley Fool]], 2009-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

While most Ponzi schemes are based on non-existent businesses, ZZZZ Best's carpet-cleaning division was real and won high marks for its quality.&lt;ref name=LAT1/&gt;  However, its insurance restoration division, which eventually accounted for 86% of company revenues, was fake.&lt;ref name=LATIndictment&gt;Murphy, Kim; Miller, Alan C. [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-16/news/mn-9392_1_barry-minkow Minkow, 10 Others Face 54 Counts] [[Los Angeles Times]], 1988-01-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Minkow raised money by [[factoring (finance)|factoring]] his [[accounts receivable]] for work under contract, as well as floating funds through several banks in an elaborate check kiting scheme.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

After graduating from high school in 1985, Minkow devoted all of his time to ZZZZ Best. Short of cash, he got a loan from Jack Catain, a Los Angeles businessman who had ties to [[organized crime]]. Catain later sued Minkow for not paying him his share of the company's profits, but Minkow claimed Catain was a [[usury|usurer]]. The suit was still working its way through the courts at the time of Catain's death in 1987.&lt;ref name=LAT1/&gt;  Other organized crime figures turned up as Minkow's advisers, which unnerved his employees.&lt;ref name=CleanSweep/&gt; For instance, a major shareholder, Maurice Rind, had been convicted of [[securities fraud]] in 1976.  Minkow was also a business partner with Robert Viggiano, a convicted jewel thief and reputed [[loanshark]].&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;Akst, Daniel.

==Going public==

At the suggestion of a friend, Minkow took the company public in January 1986, garnering a spot on [[NASDAQ]].&lt;ref name=CleanSweep/&gt;  The accountant who audited the company before it went public did not visit the insurance restoration sites himself. Had he done so, he would have discovered they were mailboxes located throughout the San Fernando Valley.&lt;ref name=CleanSweep/&gt;&lt;ref name=AllB&gt;Naff, Kevin. [http://www.allbusiness.com/accounting-reporting/fraud/474756-1.html Z scam of z century]. Business Credit, 1994-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt;  Minkow retained a 53 percent controlling interest, making him an instant millionaire on paper. Going public seemingly offered him a way to cover up his fraudulent activities. Under securities law at the time, he had to retain his personal shares for two years.  He planned to sell a million shares to the public in January 1988, believing this would give him enough money to pay everyone off and go completely legitimate.&lt;ref name=LAT1/&gt;&lt;ref name=CleanSweep/&gt;&lt;ref name=CaseStudy&gt;[http://www.rohanchambers.com/Courses/Auditing/ZZZZ%20Best%20Company.htm ZZZZ Best case study]&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to obtain more financing, Minkow was persuaded to raise $15 million of capital through an [[initial public offering]] of ZZZZ Best stock. When accountants wanted to inspect the company's operations, Minkow borrowed fake offices for a tour of "Interstate Appraisal Services" and used an incomplete building to present a fake restoration job. Mark Morze, ZZZZ Best's financial consultant, tricked the accountants sent to perform the necessary [[due diligence]] by faking thousands of documents. The public offering closed in December and Minkow became the youngest person to lead a company through an IPO in American financial history.&lt;ref name=AllB/&gt;

Minkow launched a massive television advertising campaign portraying ZZZZ Best as a carpet cleaner that Southern Californians could trust.&lt;ref name=LAT2&gt;Stavro, Barry; Miller, Alan C. [http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-06/news/mn-6256_1_barry-minkow ZZZZ Best: The House of Cards Falls]. [[Los Angeles Times]], 1987-09-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  He owned a [[Ferrari]] and a [[BMW]], and bought a mansion in the wealthy Valley community of [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]].&lt;ref name=LALaunder&gt;Stavro, Barry.

[[Los Angeles Times]], 1987-07-09.&lt;/ref&gt;  He had ambitions of making the company "the [[General Motors]] of the carpet-cleaning industry."&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

The company's [[chief financial officer]], Charles Arrington, was accused of running up $91,000 in fraudulent charges against customers of his florist business.&lt;ref name=LAT3&gt;Akst, Daniel. [http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-22/business/fi-1124_1 Behind "Whiz Kid" Is a Trail of False Credit Card Billings]. [[Los Angeles Times]], 1987-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Feshbach brothers, a pair of [[short (finance)|short-sellers]], learned that Minkow still stood behind Arrington, they did further investigating and discovered ZZZZ Best's claimed $7 million contract to clean carpets in [[Sacramento]] was likely a fraud. The Feshbachs and other short-sellers began taking positions, anticipating that the company's stock would fall.&lt;ref&gt;Fromson, Brett Duval.

[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]], 1987-08-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, none of the company's four outside directors had any experience running a public company.&lt;ref name=Fall&gt;Stevenson, Richard W.

==Downfall==
By February 1987, ZZZZ Best was trading at $18 a share on NASDAQ, valuing the company at $280 million.&lt;ref&gt;Elmer-Dewitt, Philip; Brown, Scott. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965064-1,00.html ZZZZ Best may be ZZZZ]. [[Time (magazine)|Time]], 1987-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The company now had 1,030 employees with offices across California, [[Arizona]] and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name=Conviction&gt;Murphy, Kim; Soble, Ronald L. [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-12-15/news/mn-362_1_barry-minkow Minkow Is Convicted on All Charges : Jury Decides That ZZZZ Best Founder Masterminded Fraud]. [[Los Angeles Times]], 1988-12-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Minkow's stake was worth $100 million. He appeared to be the ultimate American success story.&lt;ref name=LAW1/&gt;

However, the company was still facing severe cash flow shortages from paying investors for the non-existent restoration projects. Minkow needed another infusion of cash and thought he had it when he heard that KeyServ, the authorized carpet cleaner for [[Sears]], was being sold by its British parent.&lt;ref name=CleanSweep/&gt;  [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] offered to finance the deal with a private placement of [[junk bonds]].&lt;ref name=LAT4&gt;Murphy, Kim. [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-30/news/mn-622_1_barry-minkow 'Like the 3 Stooges' : ZZZZ Best: How the Big Bubble Burst].  [[Los Angeles Times]], 1989-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Minkow thought that KeyServ's Sears business would give ZZZZ Best enough cash to end the Ponzi scheme sooner than planned.&lt;ref name=AllB/&gt;

Although KeyServ was double the size of Minkow's company, the two companies agreed to a $25 million deal in which ZZZZ Best would be the surviving company. The merger would have made Minkow the president and chairman of the board of the largest independent carpet-cleaning company in the nation.&lt;ref name=CleanSweep/&gt;  Even as the process of merging with KeyServ got underway, Minkow had ambitions of becoming more powerful. He was already making plans to raise $700–800 million to buy [[ServiceMaster]] in a hostile takeover.&lt;ref name=AllB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT4/&gt; He also had plans to expand to the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=LAT1/&gt;  Outside of carpet cleaning, he had begun preliminary discussions to buy [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Seattle Mariners]].&lt;ref name=LAT4/&gt;

Then, almost as rapidly as ZZZZ Best rose, it fell due to the credit card fraud of several years earlier. Minkow had blamed the fraudulent charges on unscrupulous contractors and another employee, and paid back most of the victims. However, he had not paid back a homemaker who had been overcharged a few hundred dollars.&lt;ref name=CleanSweep/&gt; Minkow ignored the woman's requests to pay her back. The woman tracked down several other people who had been defrauded by Minkow&lt;ref name=CaseStudy/&gt; and gave a diary of her findings to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. The ''Times'' then wrote a story revealing that Minkow had run up $72,000 in fraudulent credit card charges in 1984 and 1985.&lt;ref name=LAT3/&gt; The story, which ran just days before the KeyServ merger was to close, sent ZZZZ Best stock plunging 28 percent.

Within hours of the story breaking, ZZZZ Best's banks either called their loans or threatened to do so. Drexel postponed closing until it could investigate further. Later that day at a press conference, a reporter detonated another bombshell. She had evidence that the Sacramento project didn't even exist. More seriously, she'd discovered that ZZZZ Best did not have a contractor's license required for large-scale restoration work.&lt;ref name=CleanSweep/&gt; To calm nervous investors, Minkow issued a press release touting record profits and revenues, but did so without notifying Ernst &amp; Whinney (now part of [[Ernst &amp; Young]]), the firm responsible for auditing the company prior to the KeyServ deal. The press release also implied that Drexel had cleared ZZZZ Best of any wrongdoing, briefly stopping the decline.  However, Drexel abruptly pulled out of the deal a few days later, causing the stock price to fall again.&lt;ref name=CleanSweep/&gt;&lt;ref name=CaseStudy/&gt; Drexel's withdrawal stopped the deal only four to seven days before it was due to close.&lt;ref name=LAT4/&gt;

The day after this press release, Ernst &amp; Whinney discovered that Minkow had written several checks to support the validity of the non-existent contracts. Many of them had been written to an associate who later told Ernst &amp; Whinney officials about the fraud. Minkow denied knowing the man, but shortly after the checks were discovered, Ernst &amp; Whinney discovered that Minkow had cut two checks to him for an unrelated matter. When Minkow could not explain the checks, Ernst &amp; Whinney resigned as his company's auditor. However, it did not inform the SEC of its suspicions until a month later.&lt;ref name=CaseStudy/&gt;

On July 2, Minkow abruptly resigned for "health reasons."  By this time, his company's stock had tumbled to $3.50 a share—an 81 percent drop from its high in February.&lt;ref&gt;Stavro, Barry. [http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-03/business/fi-910_1 Attorney Cites 'Health Reasons' : Barry Minkow Is Reported to Resign as Head of ZZZZ Best].  [[Los Angeles Times]], 1987-07-03.&lt;/ref&gt; It turned out that on June 27, an independent law firm ZZZZ Best retained to investigate the allegations of wrongdoing asked for the addresses for all of the company's restoration jobs. Minkow knew he could not produce them, prompting him to resign six days later.&lt;ref name=CleanSweep/&gt;  Later, he reportedly told a member of his board that the insurance restoration business had been a sham from the very beginning.&lt;ref name=LATIndictment/&gt;

ZZZZ Best's new board conducted an internal investigation that largely substantiated the fraud allegations.  On July 6, it sued Minkow, alleging that he had absconded with $23 million in company funds.  The company claimed that its assets had been drained to the point that it was forced into [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Richard W. [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/07/business/zzzz-best-to-file-for-chapter-11.html ZZZZ Best to file for Chapter 11]. ''The New York Times'', 1987-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] raided ZZZZ Best's headquarters and Minkow's home, and found evidence that the company was being used to [[money laundering|launder]] drug profits for organized crime.&lt;ref name=LALaunder/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fall/&gt;

==Conviction and prison==
Minkow and 10 other ZZZZ Best insiders were indicted by a Los Angeles federal grand jury in January 1988 on 54 counts of [[racketeering]], securities fraud, money laundering, [[embezzlement]], [[mail fraud]], [[tax evasion]] and [[bank fraud]].  The indictment accused Minkow of bilking banks and investors of millions of dollars while systematically draining his company of assets. It also accused Minkow of setting up dummy companies, writing phony invoices and conducting tours of purported restoration sites.  Prosecutors estimated that as much as 90 percent of the company's revenue was fraudulent.&lt;ref name=LATIndictment/&gt;  On June 16, prosecutors won a superseding indictment charging Minkow with credit card fraud and two additional counts of mail fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Kim.

While Minkow admitted to manipulating the company's stock, he claimed that he was forced to turn the company into a Ponzi scheme under pressure from the organized-crime figures who secretly controlled his company,&lt;ref&gt;Soble, Ronald L. [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-12-08/local/me-1164_1_barry-minkow Mob Wants Conviction of Minkow, Jurors Told]. [[Los Angeles Times]], 1988-12-08.&lt;/ref&gt; a story he later admitted was false.&lt;ref name=CleanSweep/&gt; On December 14, he was found guilty on all charges.&lt;ref name=Conviction/&gt;  On March 27, 1989, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison.  He was also placed on five years probation and ordered to pay $26 million in restitution.  In sentencing him, U.S. District Court Judge [[Dickran Tevrizian]] described Minkow as a man without a conscience.  He rejected Minkow's plea for a lighter sentence as "a joke" and "a slap on the wrist" for someone who had manipulated the financial system. The SEC subsequently banned him from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company again.  He served under seven and a half years, most of them at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Englewood]].

While imprisoned, Minkow had become a [[born-again Christian]].&lt;ref name=BB1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barett|first=Paul|title=American Hustle: The CEO, the Ex-Partner, the Pastor, and the $1 Billion Shakedown|journal=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=December 19, 2013|pages=62–68|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-19/how-lennar-fought-an-extortion-attempt-and-won-a-1-billion-judgment}}&lt;!-- Accessed 2015-08-10 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During his prison stay, he became involved in Christian ministry, completing coursework through [[Liberty University]]'s School of Lifelong Learning.&lt;ref name=CleanSweep/&gt;

==Release==
After Minkow's early release from prison in 1995, he went to work as Pastor of Evangelism at the Church at Rocky Peak in [[Chatsworth, California]]. He also became director of the church's Bible Institute.&lt;ref name=LAW1/&gt;

In 1995, he wrote a first-hand account of the ZZZZ Best scam, ''Clean Sweep.'' All of the book's proceeds went toward repaying his victims.&lt;ref name=CleanSweep/&gt;   His other substantial debt is a $7 million loan from [[Union Bank N.A.|Union Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-30/business/fi-677_1_barry-minkow Barry Minkow Ordered to Repay $7-Million Loan]. [[Associated Press]] via [[Los Angeles Times]], 1990-06-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, he became pastor of Community Bible Church in [[San Diego]].  Soon after his arrival, a church member asked him to look into a money management firm in nearby [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].  Suspecting something was amiss, Minkow alerted federal authorities, who discovered the firm was a $300 million [[pyramid scheme]].  This was the beginning of the Fraud Discovery Institute, a for-profit investigative firm (which eventually transpired to be a fraud itself).  His original targets were [[penny stock]] companies, which are often havens for fraud.  However, he soon attracted the attention of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and [[Bloomberg News]].  He also began appearing on ''[[Your World with Neil Cavuto]]'' as a fraud expert.  Minkow first gained national attention when ''[[60 Minutes]]'' aired a profile of him in August 2006.  Several Wall Street investors liked what they saw, and sent him enough money to go after bigger targets.&lt;ref name=UTSeries2&gt;Calbreath, Dean.

==Shorting stock==

Minkow's motives were brought into question by multiple news stories concluding that Minkow was shorting stock before he released a report on a public company.  According to the ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]],'' Minkow had engaged in this practice as early as 2006.  Minkow's critics denounced this practice as unethical, if not illegal. At least one critic accused him of engaging in [[short and distort]], a form of securities fraud which is a reversal of a [[pump and dump]] scheme.&lt;ref name=UTSeries3&gt;Calbreath, Dean. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709053652/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/jul/06/minkow-attacking-lennar/ Barry Minkow's half-billion dollar blitzkrieg]. [[San Diego Union-Tribune]], 2011-07-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, he accused [[Herbalife]] of a "laundry list" of issues,&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt; and Minkow had "correctly revealed that Herbalife's president had inflated his résumé."&lt;ref name=LAW1/&gt; Herbalife paid Minkow $300,000,&lt;ref name=greenberg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenberg|first1=Herb|authorlink1=Herb Greenberg|title=Why Did Herbalife Pay Felon Barry Minkow $300,000?: Greenberg|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/47266789|accessdate=5 December 2014|work=Market Insider|agency=CNBC|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which Minkow issued a press release withdrawing all accusations and contentions against Herbalife,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fraud Discovery Institute Retracts Herbalife Accusations|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080821006199/en/Fraud-Discovery-Institute-Retracts-Herbalife-Accusations|website=BusinessWire (press release)|publisher=Herbalife|accessdate=2015-08-15|date=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and removed all the accusations from his website.

On 20 February 2007, Minkow, distributed a 500-page report to officials at the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) accusing [[USANA]] of operating an illegal [[pyramid scheme]].&lt;ref name="Pyramid, Phony Bios"&gt;{{cite news| title=Pyramid, Phony Bios | author = Don Bauder| url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2007/sep/13/pyramid-phony-bios/|publisher="''[[San Diego Reader]]''| date=13 September 2007|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="As stocks plunge"&gt;{{cite news|title=As stocks plunge, Usana sues Minkow over report | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20070317/ai_n18742962 | author=Dave Anderton |publisher=''[[Deseret Morning News]]''|date=17 March 2007| accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; USANA countered by lodging suits against Minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation.

On the day Minkow's report was released, USANA's shares had traded at $61.19 but by August the share price had tumbled to less than $35.&lt;ref name="Pyramid, Phony Bios"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TNBR&gt;{{cite web | title = Forbes is Usana's latest critic | author = Helen Malmgren | publisher = [[The National Business Review]] | date = 11 August 2007 | url = http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/forbes-usanas-latest-critic | accessdate = 11 August 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724193649/http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/forbes-usanas-latest-critic | archive-date = 2011-07-24 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minkow acknowledged that he was [[short selling|shorting]] USANA's shares, hoping to profit from a drop in the stock price.&lt;ref name="Another Usana official forced to revise resume"&gt;{{cite news| title=Another Usana official forced to revise resume | author=Paul Foy| url=http://www.heraldextra.com/business/article_9224831a-7969-5074-9aaf-0229d4609b60.html | publisher=''[[Daily Herald (Utah)|Daily Herald]]''| date=12 June 2007 | accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in reference to USANA's lawsuit, news columnist Herb Greenberg commented that the criticism of Minkow "is a bunch of malarkey; he has a right to publish his research, as long as people know his position [in the stock]." Minkow had revealed in the report that he was betting for the stock to go down.&lt;ref name="Pyramid, Phony Bios"/&gt; USANA dropped the defamation suit and in March 2008 U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by USANA against Minkow ruling that USANAs claims violated California's anti-SLAPP law for suing Minkow for fair criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=USANA ordered to pay for SLAPP violation| url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=9182495&amp;itype=NGPSID |agency=Associated Press|publisher=''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]''| date=7 May 2008| accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that USANA did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims.&lt;ref name="Tom Harvey"&gt;{{cite news|title=USANA claims tossed| url=http://www.sltrib.com/ci_8470183 |author=Tom Harvey| publisher=''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]''| date=6 March 2008| accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge also cited two examples where USANA failed to refute Minkow's claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lower-priced brands.&lt;ref name="Tom Harvey"/&gt; The remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in July 2008 when USANA and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement, which included the removal of all USANA-related materials from the Fraud Discovery Institute website, a related Chinese website, and from YouTube. Minkow also agreed to never trade in USANA's stock again.&lt;ref name="Supplement-maker USANA settles suit with critic"&gt;{{cite news|title=Supplement-maker USANA settles suit with critic| url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700246669/Supplement-maker-USANA-settles-suit-with-critic.html | author=Paul Foy|publisher=''[[Associated Press]]''|date=29 July 2008|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Separately from the settlement, the company paid $142,510 in attorney fees to Minkow and his institute under an order from federal Magistrate Samuel Alba. Court documents show that USANA never pursued others whom they suspected of being part of the alleged stock manipulation nor did they ask for an injunction, their only avenue of release in this case.&lt;ref name="Tom Harvey"/&gt;

Minkow almost always held a position in securities on which he reported.&lt;ref name="frauddiscovery.net"&gt;[http://www.frauddiscovery.net/disclaimer.html Fraud Discovery Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730102628/http://www.frauddiscovery.net/disclaimer.html |date=2010-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he has since stated that while his lawyers advised him this practice was legal, it was probably unethical.&lt;ref name=UTSeries3/&gt; Several companies have sued Minkow for making false accusations against them, most of which have been settled out of court.&lt;ref name=UTSeries2/&gt;

==Lennar==
In 2009, Minkow issued a report accusing major homebuilder [[Lennar]] of massive fraud.  Minkow claimed that irregularities in Lennar's off-balance-sheet debt accounting were evidence of a massive Ponzi scheme.  Minkow accused Lennar of not disclosing enough information about this to its shareholders, and also claimed a Lennar executive took out a fraudulent personal loan.&lt;ref name=WSJ4&gt;Whelan, Robbie. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703899704576204582698571822 Minkow to Plead Guilty in Lennar Insider-Trading Case]. ''The Wall Street Journal'', 2011-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In an accompanying YouTube video, Minkow denounced Lennar as "a financial crime in progress" and "a corporate bully."  Lennar's stock plummeted in the wake of Minkow's reports.  From January 9 (when Minkow first made his accusations) to January 22, Lennar's stock tumbled from $11.57 a share to only $6.55.&lt;ref name=UTSeries3/&gt;  Minkow issued the report after being contacted by Nicholas Marsch, a San Diego developer who had filed two lawsuits against Lennar for fraud.  Indeed, the language of the FDI report echoed that used in Marsch's filings.  One of Marsch's suits was summarily thrown out; the other ended with Marsch having to pay Lennar $12 million in counterclaims.&lt;ref name=LAW1/&gt;

Lennar responded by adding Minkow as a defendant in a [[libel]]-and-[[extortion]] suit against Marsch.  Minkow was initially unconcerned, since he had prevailed before in similar cases on free-speech grounds.&lt;ref name=UTSeries3/&gt; According to court records, Minkow had shorted Lennar stock, buying $20,000 worth of options in a bet that the stock would fall.&lt;ref name=WSJ4/&gt;  Even more seriously, he also ''bought'' Lennar stock after his FDI report, believing the stock would rebound after its dramatic plunge.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Beth.

[[LA Weekly]], 2010-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt;   Minkow initially denied doing this, only to be forced to recant when confronted with trading records.  Minkow also forged documents alleging misconduct on Lennar's part, and lied about having to go to the emergency room on the night before he was first scheduled to testify.  He also went forward with the report even after a private investigator he had hired for the case could not substantiate Marsch's claims.  In an unrelated development, it was also revealed that Minkow operated the FDI out of the offices of his church and even used church money to fund it—something which could potentially jeopardize his church's tax-exempt status.&lt;ref name=LAW1/&gt;

On December 27, 2010, Florida Circuit Court Judge Gill Freeman issued [[terminating sanction]]s against Minkow in response to a motion by Lennar. Freeman found that Minkow had repeatedly lied under oath, destroyed or withheld evidence, concealed witnesses, and deliberately tried to "cover up his misconduct." According to Freeman, Minkow had even lied to his own lawyers about his behavior. Freeman determined that Minkow had perpetrated "a fraud on the court" that was so egregious that letting the case go any further would be a disservice to justice.  In her view, "no remedy short of [[default judgment|default]]" was appropriate for Minkow's lies.   She ordered Minkow to reimburse Lennar for the legal expenses it incurred while ferreting out his lies. According to legal experts, it is extremely rare for a judge to issue terminating sanctions, since they are reserved for particularly egregious misconduct and have the effect of revoking a litigant's right to defend himself. Earlier, Freeman had been so angered by Minkow's behavior that she called him a liar in open court, a rarity for a judge.  Lennar estimates that its attorneys and investigators spent hundreds of millions of dollars exposing Minkow's lies.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Beth.

==Insider trading guilty plea==
On March 16, 2011, Minkow announced through his attorney that he was pleading guilty to one count of [[insider trading]]. According to his lawyer, Minkow had bought his Lennar options using "nonpublic information." The plea, which is separate from the civil suit, came a month after Minkow learned he was the subject of a criminal investigation. Minkow claimed not to know at the time that he was breaking the law. The SEC had already been probing Minkow's trading practices. On the same day, Minkow resigned as senior pastor of Community Bible Church, saying in a letter to his flock that since he was no longer "above reproach," he felt that he was "no longer qualified to be a pastor." Six weeks earlier, $50,000 in cash and checks was stolen from the church during a [[burglary]]. Though unsolved, it was noted as suspicious due to Minkow's admitted history of staging burglaries to collect insurance money.&lt;ref name=WSJ4/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT7&gt;Reckard, E. Scott; Li, Shan.

The nature of the "nonpublic information" became clear a week later, when federal prosecutors in [[Miami]] filed a [[criminal information]] charging Minkow with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud.  Prosecutors charged that Minkow and Marsch (listed as an [[unindicted co-conspirator]] in the complaint) conspired to extort money from Lennar by driving down its stock.  The complaint also revealed that Minkow had sent his allegations to the [[FBI]], SEC and [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], and that the three agencies found his claims credible enough to open a formal criminal investigation into Lennar's practices.  Minkow then used confidential knowledge of that investigation to short Lennar stock, even though he knew he was barred from doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/usao/fls/PressReleases/Attachments/110324-01.Information.pdf Criminal complaint against Minkow]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olorunnipa, Toluse.

On March 30, 2011, Minkow pleaded guilty before Judge [[Patricia A. Seitz]].  Minkow's attorney, Alvin Entin, admitted that his client had acted recklessly, but had been "deluded and taken advantage of" by Marsch.  He faced a maximum of five years in prison, as much as $350,000 in fines and penalties and $500 million in restitution.  However, he has agreed to cooperate with the government in its probe of Marsch.&lt;ref&gt;Milford, Phil; Nesmith, Susannah.

[[Dow Jones Newswires]], 2011-06-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' obtained a copy of the plea agreement, in which Minkow admitted to issuing his FDI report on Lennar at Marsch's behest.  According to the agreement, Marsch offered to have Minkow retract his report if Lennar paid him in cash and stock.  It also said that Minkow's report triggered a [[bear raid]] which temporarily reduced the market capitalization of Lennar by $583 million. Minkow faced a minimum of 30 years in prison had the case gone to trial.&lt;ref&gt;Reckard, E. Scott.

In a pre-sentencing evaluation performed on May 10, 2011, Minkow was diagnosed by a Dr. Michael Brannon as having [[antisocial personality disorder]], [[narcissistic personality disorder]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[anxiety disorder]], [[opioid dependence]], [[anabolic steroid]] abuse, and [[migraine]] headaches.&lt;ref name="foxbusiness.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2011/06/22/what-really-lurks-in-mind-barry-minkow/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204117/http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2011/06/22/what-really-lurks-in-mind-barry-minkow/ |archive-date=2013-10-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/blog/2011/06/minkow-seeks-leniency-in-lennar-case.html| title=Mikow seeks leniency in Lennar case| author=Paul Brinkmann| date=June 20, 2011| publisher=South Florida Business Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, Freeman ordered Minkow to pay Lennar $584 million in damages—roughly the amount the company lost as a result of the bear raid.  Freeman's ruling stated that Minkow and Marsch had entered into a conspiracy to wreck Lennar's stock in November 2008.&lt;ref name=Judgment/&gt;  With interest, the bill could easily approach a billion dollars—far more than he stole in the ZZZZ Best scam.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Al.

On July 6, it emerged that officials with Community Bible Church had accused Minkow of running the Fraud Discovery Institute with church funds, applying for credit cards in the names of church members and leading his flock into bad investments.  Church officials had made the claims as part of a confidential pre-sentencing report.  When Minkow's attorney, Alvin Entin, got word of the letter, he asked for and was granted two weeks to review the allegations and respond to them.  This pushed Minkow's sentencing back to July 21.&lt;ref name=UTSentence/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reckard, E. Scott.

[[Los Angeles Times]], 2011-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the second time Minkow's sentencing had been postponed; it was originally slated for June 16 but was postponed to July 6.

On July 21, Seitz sentenced Minkow to five years in prison.  In imposing the sentence, Seitz said that Minkow had "no moral compass that says 'Stop.'" Seitz also ordered him to pay Lennar $583.5 million in restitution—an amount that had been imposed a month earlier in the civil case.&lt;ref name=HeraldSentence/&gt;&lt;ref name=UTSentence&gt;Calbreath, Dean.

==Church fraud guilty plea==
On June 14, 2011; [[KGTV]] in San Diego interviewed several members of Minkow's former church, who said Minkow swindled them.  One woman said Minkow asked her for $300,000, purportedly to help finance a movie about his redemption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10news.com/news/28239261/detail.html Parishoners claim ex-pastor betrayed their trust]. [[KGTV]], 2011-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2014, Minkow pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud and to defraud the federal government.

On April 28, 2014, Judge [[Michael M. Anello]] sentenced Minkow to five years in prison, the maximum possible sentence under his plea bargain.  It is to be served after Minkow completes his sentence for securities fraud.  While Minkow's attorneys asked for a sentence of 41 months, Anello felt he had to impose the maximum for what he called a "despicable, inexcusable crime."&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, Paul.

==Film adaptation==
Prior to his 2011 conviction, production began on a film detailing Barry Minkow's life and redemption. The film featuring [[Mark Hamill]], [[Justin Baldoni]], [[Talia Shire]], and [[Ving Rhames]] was partially funded by donations Minkow solicited from his congregation. Minkow insisted on playing the middle aged version of himself in the film. Following his arrest the film's release was cancelled and work began on a new ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441922/fullcredits |title=Minkow (2017) |accessdate=2015-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113215253/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441922/fullcredits |archivedate=2017-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2015/feb/25/citylights1-missing-minkow-movie/# |title=Missing from the Minkow movie |last=Bauder |first=Don |date=2015-02-25 |publisher=San Diego Reader |access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/19/business/la-fi-minkow-movie-20110319 |title=Film based on Barry Minkow's life needs new ending |last=Horn |first=John |date=2011-03-19 |publisher=LA Times |access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film - retitled ''Con Man'' from the original title ''Minkow'' - was eventually released in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2018/mar/22/ticker-barry-minkow-movie-finally-out |title=Barry Minkow movie is finally out |last=Bauder |first=Don |date=22 March 2018 |publisher=San Diego Reader|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning she woke up with her nails bitten by rats. The director decided to cancel the shoot, VB Rajendra Prasad rushed to see Bhanumathi applying iodine casually on the nails and asking when she could start work. While continuing with the shooting, she said, "If you cancel shoot for small things how will I be a Bhanumathi (which means ‘shining like the sun’ in Sanskrit)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/i-could-not-make-a-good-movie-for-my-son/article4423447.ece|title=‘I could not make a good movie for my son’|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bozo''', or '''Boso''', meaning ''house of straw'', is a [[Mande language]] spoken by the [[Bozo people]], the principal fishing people of the [[Inner Niger Delta]] in [[Mali]]. According to the 2000 census, the Bozo people number about 132,100. The Bozo [[dialect cluster]] is often considered to be one language, but there is quite a bit of diversity. ''Ethnologue'' recognises four languages on the basis of requirements for literacy materials. Bozo is part of the northwestern branch of the Mande languages; the closest linguistic relative is [[Soninke language|Soninke]], a major language spoken in the northwestern section of southern Mali, in eastern Senegal, and in southern Mauritania. The Bozo often speak one or more regional languages such as [[Bambara language|Bamana]], [[Fulfulde language|Maasina Fulfulde]], or [[Songhay languages|Western Songhay]]. The language is [[tone language|tonal]], with three lexical tones.

The Bozo cluster is divided into the following varieties:
*Hainyaxo (Hainyaho, Kɛlɛngaxo) (a few thousand speakers)&lt;ref&gt;The [[Ethnologue]] (15th edition) reports for both Hainyaho and Tigemaxo identical speaker counts: 117,696, from the 1987 census. In the fourteenth edition, this number was noted to be the number of 'all mother tongue Boso speakers'. ({{cite web |url=http://www.ethologue.com/14/show_language.asp?code%3DBZX |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930124841/http://www.ethologue.com/14/show_language.asp?code=BZX |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}, {{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_language.asp?code%3DBOZ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514190629/http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_language.asp?code=BOZ |archivedate=2006-05-14 |df= }}) In the light of the 200,000 reported speakers of Sorogama, by far the most widely spoken Bozo variety, speaker numbers for Hainyaho and Tigemaxo are put at 'a few thousand' here.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tiɛma Cɛwɛ (Tièma cièwe) (2,500 speakers in 1991)
*Tiéyaxo (Tigemaxo) (a few thousand speakers)
*Sorogaama (Jenaama, Sorko) (200,000 speakers in 2005)

Hainyaho, spoken by the Hain (sg. Xan), is the most western dialect, spoken in two spots along the Niger. It is most closely related to Tigemaxo, its eastern neighbour which is spoken around [[Diafarabé]]. The central and most widely spoken Bozo language is Sorogama, which actually consists of four dialects, Pondori (south of [[Mopti]]), Kotya, Korondugu (north of [[Mopti]]) and Debo (around [[Lake Debo]]). Tièma Cièwè is the northeastern most of the Bozo cluster, spoken in the vicinity of Lake Debo.

'''Cannabis in Hungary''' is illegal. There is no distinction in Hungarian law between illicit drugs according to dangers. Heroin use has the same legal consequences as cannabis use. Hungarian law prohibits the distribution, and any use (including medical use). However the Penal code distinguishes the punishment between sale and personal use. 283. § (1) paragraph (a) states that "One cannot be punished for drug misuse; if a small, personal amount is produced, acquired, or in possession..." and continues to state that "... provided that before final verdict is determined a verification is provided that continuous 6-month therapy has taken place" The law determines that a "personal quantity" is defined as 1&amp;nbsp;gram of active substance (i.e. THC), therefore this equates to 12–100&amp;nbsp;grams of marijuana if calculated that marijuana contains 1–8% THC per unit mass. Possession of larger amounts can lead to a 5–10-year prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author = Minstrel |url = http://www.daath.hu/showText.php?id=62#chapter3 |title = Társaság a Szabadságjogokért: Drogjog 1999 VOTED VOTE D2ID : 62 |publisher = Daath.hu |date =  |accessdate = 2011-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chechen mafia''' ({{lang-ce|Нохчийн мафи}}, ''Noxçiyn mafi''; {{lang-rus|Чеченская мафия|Chechenskaya mafiya}}) is one of the largest ethnic [[organized crime]] groups operating in the former [[Soviet Union]] next to established [[Russian mafia]] groups.

==Structure==
While most Slavic and Caucasian gangsters in the Soviet era followed the [[Thief in law|thieves in law]] subculture, Chechens largely resisted this, instead preferring to use the tribal structure of the ''[[teip]]'' as well as the concept of an ''[[abrek]]'', the outlaw-hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inmoscowsshadows.wordpress.com/2008/09/01/blood-brotherhood-chechen-organised-crime/|title=Blood Brotherhood: Chechen organised crime|work=In Moscow's Shadows|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Moscow==
The Moscow branch of the Chechen mafia, also known as the ''Obschina'' or "community", was founded by gangster [[Nikolay Suleimanov]] during the 1980s. Suliemanov operated a second-hand car business and made the bulk of his profits through tax evasion. The group later moved into extortion as capitalism penetrated the Soviet economy, and at this point [[Khozh-Ahmed Noukhayev]], at the time a university student and part of an underground student movement dedicated to Chechen independence, was brought in as an enforcer. The more ideological Noukhayev imposed an additional condition on businesses under his "protection", which was that they must invite a Chechen into their workforce. Facilitating Chechen migration into Moscow would mean his organisation became a formidable force in the underworld. [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] was one of the businessmen associated with the Chechens during this period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Khlebnikov|Khlebnikov P.]] ''Conversation with a Barbarian: Interviews with a Chechen Field Commander on Banditry and Islam''. Moscow, Detekiv-Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chechen reputation for violence was formidable, and before long they became the dominant crime group in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Gentelev, Alexander; ''[[Thieves by Law]]''; 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This brought them into conflict with the Slavic gangs, including the [[Solntsevskaya bratva]] and the [[Orekhovskaya gang]], who formed an alliance to oust the Chechens from the city. They were supported by the [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]], who were concerned at the growing links between organised crime and the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechen separatist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;''McMafia: A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld''. [[Misha Glenny]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Connections to Chechen separatism==
Khozh-Ahmed Noukhayev claimed that he started racketeering as a student to help raise funds for the Chechen nationalist cause. Indeed, over the course of his activities, Noukhayev became acquainted with [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]], who recognised his important role in Moscow's Chechen community and took him on as an unofficial aide, before helping him escape from prison in 1991. Noukhayev played a prominent role in the lead-up to the [[First Chechen War]], participating in last-minute negotiations with the Russian government. He later fought in and was wounded in the [[Battle of Grozny (1999–2000)|Battle of Grozny]]. After the war, Noukhayev continued to play a key role in Chechen politics and set up a holding company, the [[Caucasian Common Market]], which aimed to bring prosperity to [[Chechnya]] by building an oil pipeline between Europe and [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Making of a New Empire]]'', [[Jos de Putter]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt; But the [[Second Chechen War]] ended this initiative.

In the chaos of war-torn Chechnya, many of the insurgent forces turned to criminality in order to raise funds. Kidnapping became a key business for both rebels and local bandits, including [[Arbi Barayev]]'s [[Special Purpose Islamic Regiment]]. In one particularly notorious case, [[1998 abduction of foreign engineers in Chechnya|four British engineers were abducted]] and beheaded. Oil theft and smuggling also became a major source of income. During its brief period of independence, Chechnya quickly fell into anarchy, becoming a major hub for arms trafficking (with a gun market in central Grozny), mobsters using local banks to launder profits from criminal activities, and rival warlords, armed gangs, and [[Islamic terrorism|Islamist terrorists]] all fighting each other for control. It was this atmosphere of lawlessness that exacerbated tensions with Russia and helped provide justification for the Second Chechen War.&lt;ref&gt;Zurcher, Christoph; ''The Post-Soviet Wars: Rebellion, Ethnic Conflict, and Nationhood in the Caucasus''; NYU Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to the Chechen government==
Under the rule of [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], the criminalisation of Chechnya has taken a somewhat different turn to the wartime chaos that preceded it. Government officials have been accused of embezzling billions in state funds from Moscow, turning Chechnya into something of a financial "[[black hole]]", as well as demanding kickbacks for construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4091635.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - War racketeers plague Chechnya|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}} {{Zabyelina, Y. (2015). ‘Buying Peace’ in Chechnya: Challenges of Post-Conflict Reconstruction in The Public Sector. ''Journal of Peacebuilding and Development'', 8(3), pp. 37-49.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kadyrovtsy]] are also believed to be responsible for a number of murders and attempted murders, some of them political as in the case of the [[Yamadayev]] brothers, and some business-related, such as the attempted hit on banker [[German Gorbuntsov]] in London in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/russian-banker-london-clues-moscow|title=Attack on Russian banker in London leaves trail of clues back to Moscow|author=Luke Harding|work=the Guardian|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* In the 2008 film ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', one of the [[Gotham City]] organized crime factions is represented by a figure known as "the Chechen", portrayed by [[Ritchie Coster]]. The Chechen has at his command a pair of vicious dogs. The Chechen is later apparently killed on the orders of the Joker ([[Heath Ledger]]), who orders him to be cut up and fed to his own dogs. The dogs are later used by the Joker to attack Batman ([[Christian Bale]]).
* A side-plot of the Russian crime film ''[[Brother (1997 film)|Brother]]'' revolves around a struggle between Chechen and Russian mafia over the control of a market.
* Several episodes of ''[[Brigada]]'' deal with the titular gang's dealings with Chechen militants and organised crime figures.
* In ''[[Eastern Promises]]'', Chechen gangsters seek revenge for the killing of their associate in London.
* The Chechen mafia make an appearance in the [[Frederick Forsyth]] novel ''[[Icon (novel)|Icon]]''.
* Chechen criminal figures make an appearance at the end of ''[[The Other Guys]]''.
* In the Turkish TV series ''[[Valley of the Wolves]]'', Chechen mafia members are seen in the Valley.
* In the 2014 film ''[[The Drop (film)|The Drop]]'', the Chechen mafia uses a series of Brooklyn bars to collect illegal money.

The Chinese immigration to Serbia was prompted after former [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] President [[Slobodan Milosevic]] and his wife [[Mira Markovic]] visited [[China]] in 1997. They were 30 people in August 1998.&lt;ref name=BORBA&gt;[http://www.borba.rs/content/view/8688/123/]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a rumor that Milosevic imported over 50,000 Chinese people and gave them [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Yugoslav passport|passports]] so that they could vote for him in elections. Other rumors say that the Chinese arrived here in order to take [[language courses]]. The newspaper, [[Vecernje Novosti]], says one part of town in particular has had a complete Chinese village transplanted into it: "The entire population of the Chinese village of [[Jincun, Kaihua|Jincun]], [[Kaihua County]] in [[Zhejiang]] province has moved to [[Belgrade]], specifically to Blok 70 where they have businesses in the local center (''Kineski centar'', "Chinese center") in the suburb of [[Novi Beograd]]."

The Chinese send their children to schools in China when they have reached age for primary school, to learn the Chinese language like natives, something that is important for the community.&lt;ref name=GLAS/&gt;

Besides Belgrade (Blok 70), there is also a sizable Chinese community in the second largest Serbian city [[Novi Sad]], which has a Chinese trade center, as well as many Chinese shops and restaurants.

Only 223 Chinese have [[working permit]]s,{{how?|date=June 2018}} meaning that Belgrade's 4,000-5,000 Chinese workers profit from [[Underground economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mojevijesti.ba/novost/23899/oko-20000-kineza-u-srbiji-radi-na-crno |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706131425/http://mojevijesti.ba/novost/23899/oko-20000-kineza-u-srbiji-radi-na-crno |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comb Sister''' is a kind of Chinese traditional women culture,&lt;ref name="Sohu-News"&gt;[http://cul.sohu.com/20150319/n410000617.shtml Sohu News 搜狐新闻.]  Accessed 16.12.2015&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to a culture that some women set up their hairstyle like married women with determination to stay single all their life. Those women are called the Net Female after they die.

In the past, unmarried women who were from [[Pearl River Delta|the Pearl River delta]] like [[Guangzhou]], [[Heyuan]] cities had hairstyle of long braids. And when they got married,their mother would help them to rolled their braids into a ball because that was married women's hairstyle. However, Comb female would change their hairstyle into a bun on their own to show their determination that they would never get married until they died.&lt;ref name="Phoenix-News"&gt;"[http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150113/42923757_0.shtml#p=4 Phoenix News 凤凰新闻.] Accessed 16.12.2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of Comb Sister ==

The origin of the Comb Sister was the result of rigid [[feudal system]] in ancient [[China]].  At that time, many women could not stand being abused by their husbands, therefore, they refused to get married and decided to stay with partners to support each other till they died.&lt;ref name="Sohu-News" /&gt; The custom of the Comb Sister had kept more than 300 years under the oppression of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], and it was up to world in mid and late [[Ming dynasty]] since the rise of the silk industry provided women with work opportunities. In the 1930s, along with improvement of women's social status and the impact of war, Comb Sister gradually fade away.

== History of Comb Sister ==

In the very beginning, being a comb sister had its special ceremony. Firstly, some villagers with high reputation would represent the whole village to choose the "Lucky Day and Lucky Time"(great privilege)to hold the ceremony. And as the lucky time comes, several elder women would host the "Comb" ceremony, there the women who wanted to become comb sisters will change their hairstyle with a promise that they would never get married. And in the same day, the whole village would set tables to announce the decision to their friends and the public.

Until the 1930s, with the decline of silk industry in the [[Pearl River Delta]], young women heard that they could get the higher income if they worked in [[South Asia]],so they called their friends to go there for earning a living. In order to earn more money,many women who have worked in [[South Asia]] for many years have never talked about the marriage.

Ever since [[Revolution of 1911|The revolution of 1911]] and the establishment of [[the Republic of China]], the [[feudal system]] and customs broke down, and the custom of comb sister had declined. In the early years of [[the Republic of China]], the whole China's silk industry collapsed, which resulted in that the comb female cannot earn their livings, therefore, some of them chose to go to Hong Kong as house maids. Today's Hong Kong [[Tsat Tsz Mui Road]] also originated from those comb sister.

== Customs of Comb Sister- The Custom of Grave Keeping ==
[[File:ShundeIcon.svg|thumb|Shunde]]

Once women determined to change their hairstyle to become comb sisters,they had no choice to turn back. What was more,  if they broke their promise, they would be tortured by their villagers such as being loaded in to a pig cage and being drown in to the river. However, even they died, it was still not unacceptable for their parents to bury them.&lt;ref name="Sohu-News" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wangyi-News"&gt;[http://news.163.com/15/0319/20/AL3JD6J100014AEE.html Wangyi News 网易新闻.] Accessed 16.12.2015&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the old custom, comb sisters were not allowed to die in their home or other relatives' homes. They could only be buried out of their village. Worse still, only other comb sisters could visit the grave, hence, some of them become their friends' grave keepers, and that was the custom we call "Grave Keeping ".

== Museum of Comb Sister ==

Bingyu Museum, located in [[Jun'an, Guangdong|Jun'an]], [[Shunde]]. It is a two-story building with left, middle and right three underground blocks. In a middle block people set a statue of [[Avalokitesvara]]  and in the left and right blocks there are some tablets of dead comb sisters . Besides, the second floor is the room where comb sisters live.&lt;ref name="Xinhua-News"&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2014-11/24/c_127243780.html Xinhua News 新华网新闻.] Accessed 16.12.2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xinkuai-News"&gt;[http://news.xkb.com.cn/guangdong/2012/1226/242883.html Xinkuai News 新快网新闻.] Accessed 16.12.2015&lt;/ref&gt; The whole building takes about five hundred square meters and covers an area of nearly two acres. Bingyu Museum was officially opened to the public on 25 December 2012.

[[Image:CusterdomeInstall.jpg|thumb|right|Installation of new dome (2007)''&lt;SMALL&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070630171143/http://www.custerobservatory.org/images/domepics/3chaz.jpg]&lt;/SMALL&gt;'']]
'''Custer Observatory'''  is an astronomical [[observatory]] owned and operated by Custer Institute.
Located in [[Southold (CDP), New York|Southold, New York]] (US), facing Peconic Bay and Shelter Island, Custer's location boasts some of the darkest skies on Long Island.&lt;ref&gt;See the light pollution map [http://cleardarksky.com/lp/CstrInsNYlp.html?Mn=astronomical] on ClearSkyChart.com. Note that there is still quite a bit of light pollution compared to northern New York and other parts of the Northeast.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long Island's oldest public observatory, Custer Institute was founded in 1927 by [[Charles Elmer|Charles Wesley Elmer]]  (co-founder of the [[PerkinElmer|Perkin-Elmer Optical Company]]), along with a group of fellow amateur-astronomers.  The name was adopted to honor the hospitality of Mrs. Elmer, the Grand Niece of [[General George Armstrong Custer]].
In 1942, the Custer Institute was incorporated as a non-profit educational corporation in the State of New York.

In 1938, the group purchased the land the institute presently occupies and initial construction was completed in the spring of 1939.  The 100-seat lecture hall was added in 1945.  In 1947, through donations by Charles Elmer and Mr. Polk, the 3-story tower/library and observatory dome were built.
In 1954, Charles Elmer died; that same year, the Institute added the shed, which houses three sliding roof observatories.
Over the years, Custer has acquired a large collection of telescopes of all sizes and descriptions. Most recently, 10" Zerochromat refracting telescope and is the largest of its type in the United States. This is in the main observatory dome."

Our 10” refracting telescope was manufactured in England by Zerochromat Telescopes. Designed by award-wining optician Peter Wise, the telescope’s unique dialyte lenses make it apochromatic, providing superior views of solar system and deep space objects. The folded light path construction uses mirrors to make the telescope a manageable size (still more than 6’ long), allowing the long f/12 focal length telescope to fit in our dome.

The telescope is attached to a computer-controlled Fornax 152 equatorial mount, permitting easy aiming and object tracking. The entire assembly can be raised/lowered on the Pier-Tech pier to accommodate most users’ heights, for comfortable viewing. Custer’s Zerochromat telescope is the largest of its type in the United States."

Previously, the dome was home to a '''25-inch (f/5) [[Obsession Telescopes|Obsession]] Newtonian reflector'''.  In order to bring the eyepiece of this telescope to a level that does not require observers to climb a high ladder, '''the optics on this telescope were modified solely by Custer’s own Justine Haupt''', an engineer at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|Brookhaven National Lab]]. Justine is currently involved in working on the camera for the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope|LSST]].

==Custer Library==
The Custer Library contains a wealth of Astronomy and Science books dating from the 19th century to the present. It also houses the Institute's videotape collection and 35mm astronomical slide collection. It contains ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'', ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]'', ''Astronomy'', and ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazines dating back numerous decades. Membership to the Custer Institute grants access to their library.

==Custer Museum==
The Custer Institute Museum (in place prior to the dome renovation but currently unavailable) contains the following in its collection:

* Henry Fitz, early Custer member and famous telescope mirror maker's Grinding Table. (Similar to the one on display at the Smithsonian in Washington, DC.)
* [[James Short (mathematician)|James Short's]] circa 1750 [[Gregorian telescope]] variation designed to read the separation of [[binary star]]s. One of only three known to exist.
* Various other 18th and 19th centuries vintage spectrometers and sextants, along with other astronomical devices.
* The Custer Rock Collection including [[geode]]s and numerous Fossilized Rocks.
* The Custer Meteorite Collection, which includes a [[Mars meteorite|Shergottite]] from Mars.
* Numerous astronomical, [[sunspot]], and [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] pictures taken by past and present members.
* A broken 1750s roadside Mile Marker, recovered by Custer members that was originally ordered by Ben Franklin when he was the head of the Colonial Mail system.(Today, most of the other markers, still undamaged, mark the distance along the Main Road between Orient Point and the Old Riverhead Court House.)
* The Custer Civil War Bullet Collection.
* A piece of a tree that was originally planted at Bronx College by [[Albert Einstein]] (who often summered in Jamesport).

{{Capitalism |expanded=Ideologies}}
'''Dirigisme''' or '''dirigism''' ({{ety|fr|diriger|to direct}}) is an economic doctrine in which the state plays a strong directive role, as opposed to a merely [[Regulation|regulatory]] role, over a [[capitalist]] [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/dirigisme ''Dirigisme''] Oxford Dictionaries. Retrieved 25 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As an economic doctrine, dirigisme is the counterpart to [[laissez-faire]], stressing a positive role for state intervention in curbing productive inefficiencies and [[market failure]]s. Dirigiste policies often include [[indicative planning]], state-directed investment, and the use of market instruments (taxes and subsidies).

The term emerged in the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-war]] era to describe the economic policies of [[France]], which included substantial state-directed investment, the use of [[Indicative planning|indicative economic planning]] to supplement the [[market mechanism]], and the establishment of [[state enterprise]]s in strategic domestic sectors. It resulted in an unprecedented [[economic]] and [[demography|demographic]] growth, leading to the coinage of the term ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' ("Thirty Glorious [years]").

The term has subsequently been used to classify other economies that pursued similar policies, most notably the [[Four Asian Tigers|East Asian tiger economies]], and more recently the economy of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Models of dirigisme in East Asia: perspectives from Eastern Europe, 1996"&gt;''Models of dirigisme in East Asia: perspectives from Eastern Europe'', by Dragsbæk Schmidt, Johannes. 1996. Between Western Europe and East Asia, p. 196-216, {{ISBN|0333666046}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related concept is [[state capitalism]].

Most modern economies can be characterized as ''dirigiste'' to some degree&amp;nbsp;– for instance, the state may exercise directive action by performing or subsidizing research and development of new technologies, through government procurement (especially [[military]]) or through state-run research institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/features/2013/06/the-myth-of-the-meddling-state-nothing-ventured/ |title=The Myth of the "Meddling" State |author=Mariana Mazzucato |date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=Public Finance International |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In France==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
Before the [[Second World War]], France had a relatively fragmented [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system. The many small companies, often family-owned, were often not dynamic and efficient{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} in comparison to the large industrial groups in [[Germany]] or the [[United States]]. The Second World War laid waste to France. Railroads and industries were destroyed by aerial [[bombardment]] and [[sabotage]]; industries were seized by Nazi Germany; in the immediate postwar years loomed the spectre of long years of [[rationing]] (such as the one enforced in the [[United Kingdom]]). Some sections of the French business and political world lost authority after [[Vichy France|collaborating with the German occupiers]].

Post-war French governments, from whichever political side, generally sought rational, efficient economic development, with the long-term goal of matching the highly developed and technologically advanced economy of the [[United States]]. The development of French dirigisme coincided with the development of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]]: the [[École Nationale d'Administration]] supplied the state with high-level administrators, while leadership positions in industry were staffed with [[Corps of Mines (France)|Corps of Mines]] state engineers and other personnel trained at the [[École Polytechnique]].

During the 1945–1975 period, France experienced unprecedented [[economic growth]] (5.1% on average) and a [[demography|demographic]] boom, leading to the coinage of the term ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' ("Thirty Glorious [years]").

Dirigisme flourished under the [[right-wing|centre-right]] governments of [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Georges Pompidou]]. In those times, the policy was viewed as a middle way between the American policy of little state involvement and the Soviet policy of total state control. In 1981, [[French Socialist Party|Socialist]] president [[François Mitterrand]] was elected, promising greater [[state enterprise]] in the economy; his government soon [[nationalization|nationalised]] industries and banks. However, in 1983 the initial bad economic results forced the government to renounce dirigisme and start the era of ''rigueur'' ("rigour"). Dirigisme has remained out of favour with subsequent governments, though some of its traits remain.

===Indicative planning===
The main French tool under dirigisme was [[indicative planning]] through plans designed by the ''Commissariat général du plan'' ("Commission for the Plan"). Indicative planning used various incentives to induce public and private actors to behave in an optimal fashion, with the plan serving as a general guideline for optimal investment. During this period France never ceased to be a capitalist economy directed by the [[accumulation of capital]], profit-maximizing enterprise and [[Market economy|market-based allocation]] of producer goods.

In contrast to [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type central planning]] practiced in the former [[Eastern bloc|Soviet bloc]], where economic planning substituted market allocation and operated the factors of production according to a binding plan, the French state never owned more than a minority of industry and did not seek to replace markets with planning. The idea of dirigisme is to complement and improve the efficiency of the market through indirect planning intended to provide better information to market participants. This concept is held in contrast to a planned economy, which aims to replace market-based allocation of production and investment with a binding plan of production expressed in units of physical quantities.

===State ownership===
Because French industry prior to the Second World War was weak due to fragmentation, the French government encouraged mergers and the formation of "[[national champions]]": large industry groups backed by the state.

Two areas where the French government sought greater control were in [[infrastructure]] and the transportation system. The French government owned the national railway company [[SNCF]], the national electricity utility [[Electricité de France|EDF]], the national natural gas utility [[Gaz de France|GDF]], the national airline [[Air France]]; [[France Télécom|phone]] and [[La Poste (France)|postal]] services were operated as the [[Postes, télégraphes et téléphones (France)|PTT]] administration. The government chose to devolve the construction of most [[Freeway|autoroutes]] (freeways) to semi-private companies rather than to administer them itself. Other areas where the French government directly intervened were defense, nuclear and aerospace industries ([[Aérospatiale]]).

This development was marked by ''volontarisme'', the belief that difficulties (e.g. postwar devastation, lack of natural resources) could be overcome through willpower and ingenuity. For instance, following the [[1973 energy crisis]], the saying "In France we don't have oil, but we have ideas" was coined. Volontarisme emphasized [[modernization]], resulting in a variety of ambitious state plans. Examples of this trend include the extensive use of [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] (close to 80% of French electrical consumption), the [[Minitel]], an early online system for the masses, and the [[TGV]], a [[high-speed rail]] network.

==Other economies with dirigiste characteristics==
Economic dirigisme has been described as an inherent aspect of [[fascist]] economies by Hungarian author, [[Iván T. Berend]] in his book ''An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iván T. Berend]], An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Fascist systems created by [[Benito Mussolini]] ([[Italy]]), [[António de Oliveira Salazar|António Salazar]] ([[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]]), [[Francisco Franco]] ([[Spain]]) and [[Adolf Hitler]] ([[Germany]]) are a varied mix of elements from numerous philosophies, including: [[nationalism]], [[authoritarianism]], [[militarism]], [[corporatism]], [[collectivism]], [[totalitarianism]], and [[anti-communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baker|first=David|date=June 2006|title=The political economy of fascism: Myth or reality, or myth and reality?|journal=New Political Economy|volume=11|issue=2|pages=227–250|doi=10.1080/13563460600655581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dirigisme has been brought up as a politico-economic scheme at odds with ''laissez-faire'' capitalism in the context of French overseas holdings. Countries such as Lebanon and Syria have been influenced by this motif&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=4&amp;article_id=86003 The Daily Star] - 'Youssef Chaitani's 'Post-Colonial Syria and Lebanon' chronicles the history of division between the neighbors', 17 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; to varying degrees throughout the post-colonial period.

The economies of the East Asian tigers are sometimes characterised as being "dirigiste" due to the strong role played by the state in [[Developmental state|development planning]] and guiding investment.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. 
Dirigisme is also seen in [[India]]. The state has complete control and ownership of railways; majority control and stake in banking, insurance, electricity, and oil and gas industries; and has substantial control over telecommunication, port and shipping industries.&lt;ref name="EnergyStats2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Statistics 2017|url=http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy_Statistics_2017.pdf|website=mospi.nic.in|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="factual"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/2007/09/01001100/India-growth-story-is-attracti.html|title= India growth story is attracting talent from govt establishments|newspaper=Mint|date=1 September 2007|first=Jeetha|last=D'Silva|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCIabout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shipindia.com/newsite/DisplayContent.asp?CategoryID=1&amp;ContentID=1|title=About Us|work=Official webpage of the Shipping Corporation of India|accessdate=3 June 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071106162636/http://www.shipindia.com/newsite/DisplayContent.asp?CategoryID=1&amp;ContentID=1 |archivedate = 6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-07-27/news/29820591_1_par-with-private-insurers-sovereign-guarantee-policies], Sovereign guarantee for all policies issued by LIC will continue.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10422">A ''discussion group'' is a group of individuals with similar interest who gather either formally or informally to bring up ideas, solve problems or give comments. The major approaches are ''in person'', via ''[[conference call]]'' or ''[[website]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discussion group|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/discussion-group.html|website=Business dictionary|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; People respond comments and post [[Internet forum|forum]] in established [[mailing list]], [[news group]] or [[IRC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Searching Newsgroups, Email Lists, and Discussion Forums|url=http://www.macmillanhighered.com/catalog/static/bsm/researchroom/websearch/discussion.asp|website=The Bedford Research Room|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other group members could choose to respond by posting text or image.

==Brief history==

Discussion group was evolved from [[USENET]] which is traced back to early 80's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Usenet Newsgroups: In The Beginning.....|url=http://www.newsdemon.com/history-of-usenet/beginning.php|website=NewsDemon|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[computer scientist]]s [[USENET|Jim Ellis]] and [[USENET|Tom Truscott]] founded the idea of setting a system of rules to produce [[USENET|"articles"]], and then send back to their parallel [[news group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Usenet - What is Usenet?|url=http://www.newsdemon.com/history-of-usenet/what_is_usenet.php|website=NewDemon|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentally, the form of discussion group was generated on the concept of [[USENET]], which emphasised ways of communication via [[USENET|email]] and [[USENET|web forums]]. Gradually, [[USENET]] had developed to be a system of channels which provide notifications and [[USENET|"articles"]] to meet general public's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Usenet Newsgroups: In The Beginning.....|url=http://www.newsdemon.com/history-of-usenet/beginning.php|website=NewsDemon|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, [[World Wide Web]] gradually takes on the major role of supporting and extending platforms for discussion group on the [[Internet]] by setting up various [[USENET|web servers]].

==Overview of online discussion group==

===Google group===
'''[[Google Group]]''' has been built to be one of the major online discussion groups with a wide range of worldwide frequent users. The following subsections contain information about three popular groups used by the public today:
* Simply search any theme based on personal interest by using the [[Google Groups|search box]] on the [[Google Groups|Google groups homepage]], the results would appear after searching. Users could select themes more concisely by refining "date range, language, group or author".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Atteberry|first1=Jonathan|title=How Google Groups Works|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/social-networking/networks/google-groups1.htm|website=How Stuffs Works|accessdate=27 October 2014|date=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users could join any groups they are interested in or establish their own. 
* Three ascending levels are available for "public, announcements-only and restricted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Atteberry|first1=Jonathan|title=How Google Groups Works-Benefits of Google Groups|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/social-networking/networks/google-groups2.htm|website=How Stuff Works|accessdate=27 October 2014|date=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For considering member's accessibility to information, [[Google Groups|General public]] commands more flexibility compares to limited users with regulations. In addition, it is a privilege to subscribe a gmail account which enables users to upload documents, send invites, and create webpage.

===Facebook group===
'''[[Facebook features|Facebook group]]''' simplifies processes and protects [[Facebook|privacy]] of users when they interact with people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Usenet Newsgroups: In The Beginning.....|url=http://www.newsdemon.com/history-of-usenet/beginning.php|website=NewsDemon|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following guidelines are some general instructions about how to operate groups on Facebook:  
* By following instructions on homepage, users could create ideal groups that satisfy their personal needs. After the group is established, the [[Facebook features|admin]]s are able to make a range of adjustments to the groups pages by upload display pictures and posting note and comments on the group wall. He or she could assist the whole group with events, news updates and members management. Therefore, Facebook groups, generally, diversifies internal communication by sending invitations to friends, colleagues or certain people who share similar demographics. A single user is capable of joining up a maximum "6000 groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook groups|url=https://www.facebook.com/about/groups|website=Facebook|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whatsapp group===
'''[[Whatsapp]] group''':
Whatsapp, is a mobile [[SMS]] and messaging app, it features the function of group discussion as well. Users set group chats to boost the convenience of a proper group discussion. With shared characteristics to Facebook group, the instructions are comparatively similar. Common actions for administrators include: creating group, renaming title, blocking members, deleting irrelevant information through the management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions|url=https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/iphone/23782517|website=Whatsapp FAQ|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
*Advantages: the implementation of Google Groups comes with its own advantages. For diverse users, it provides the service of interpreting languages widely, which helps present a better way to communicate effectively with people in different countries. Considering of storage, one group member enjoys "100 megabytes (MB)" while there are no restrictions for the whole group. It delivers convenience for group members work on projects that need considerably more storage than normal files, for example, presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Group basics|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/162866443847527/|website=Facebook|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies conducted by Kushin and Kitchener indicates Facebook provide users in discussion groups with more opportunities to post content that has correlation with "social, political, or sporting issues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steenkamp|first1=Marika|last2=Hyde-Clarke|first2=Nathalie|title=The use of Facebook for political commentary in South Africa|journal=Telematics and Informatics|date=2014|volume=31 | issue = 1 |pages=91–97|doi=10.1016/j.tele.2012.10.002}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For Whatsapp users, the communication service brings enjoyment to share ideas with comparatively low cost. Ideally, it enhanced the quality of communication regarding of its records saving, security and trustability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nikou|first1=Shahrokh|last2=Bouwman|first2=Harry|author-link2=Harry Bouwman|last3=de Reuver|first3=Mark|title=The potential of converged mobile telecommunication services: a conjoint analysis|journal=Info|date=2012|volume= 14|issue= 5|pages=21–35|doi=10.1108/14636691211256287}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Information in Discussion groups are usually [[archive]]d.  For example, [[Google]]'s ''Groups'' (formerly [[DejaNews]]) is an archive of Usenet articles trace back to 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Usenet Newsgroups: In The Beginning.....|url=http://www.newsdemon.com/history-of-usenet/beginning.php|website=NewsDemon|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion group archives are sometimes an effective way to find an answer to very ambiguous questions.

== Academic==
*Small group of professionals or students formally or informally negotiate about an academic topic within certain fields. This implementation could be seen as an investigation or research based on various academic levels.  For instance, "one hundred eighty college-level psychology students" breakdown into different groups to participate in giving an orderly arrangement of preferred events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aamodt|first1=Michael G|title=Academic Ability and Student Preference for Discussion Group Activities.|journal=Teaching of Psychology|date=1983|volume=10 | issue = 2 |pages=117–19|doi=10.1207/s15328023top1002_22}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, discussion groups could support professional services and hold events to a range of demographics; another distinguished example is from "The London Biological Mass Spectrometry Discussion Group", which sustainably operates by gathering "technicians, clinicians, academics, industrialists and students" to exchange ideas on an academic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DISCUSSION GROUP|url=http://lbmsdg.org|website=LONDON BIOLOGICAL MASS SPECTROMETRY|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attributes to the development of participants' cognitive, critical thinking, and analytical skills.

The '''Fengu people'''  (in the [[Xhosa language]] ''Mfengu'' and plural ''amafengu'') are a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people, originally closely related to the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] people, but now often considered to have assimilated to the [[Xhosa people]] whose language they now speak. Historically they achieved considerable renown for their military ability in the [[Xhosa Wars|frontier wars]].

They were previously known as the '''"Fingo"''' people, and they gave their name to the district of [[Fingoland]], the southwestern portion of [[Transkei]], in the [[Eastern Cape]] of South Africa.

==History==

===Formation and early history===
The name ''amaFengu'' translates as "wanderers" and the Fengu people – like the [[Bhaca]], [[Bhele]], [[Hlubi]] and [[Zizi people|Dlamini]] peoples – was formed from the tribes that were broken up and dispersed by [[Shaka]] and his Zulu armies in the [[Mfecane]] wars.

Most of them fled westwards and settled amongst the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]. After some years of oppression by the Gcaleka [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] (who called the Fengu people their "dogs") in the 1820s, they formed an alliance with the Cape government in 1835 and Sir [[Benjamin d'Urban]] invited 17 000 to settle on the banks of the [[Fish River, Eastern Cape|Great Fish River]] in the region that later became known as the [[Ciskei]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/46.htm "Nguni"], US Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;
Some scholars, including Timothy Stapleton and Alan Webster, argue that the traditional narrative of the Fengu people as refugees of the Mfecane is in fact a lie constructed by colonial missionaries and administrators. They question the existence of the Fengu people as a distinct group prior to colonial contact, instead positing that the term was given, by the British, to a collection of Xhosa defectors, migrant laborers, and labor captives.&lt;ref&gt;Stapleton, Timothy, "The Expansion of a Pseudo-Ethnicity in the Eastern Cape: Reconsidering the Fingo "Exodus"of 1865", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Vol. 29, No. 2 (1996) {{jstor|220517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mfengu soldier of Cape Colony - Fingo People.jpg|thumb|left|The Fengu people, known across southern Africa as skilled gunmen, were invaluable allies of the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] in its frontier wars.]]

===Early frontier wars (1835–56)===
They subsequently became notable allies of the [[Cape Colony]] in the [[Xhosa Wars|frontier wars]] against their former oppressors. In this capacity, they won several victories against their Xhosa enemies (particularly the Gcaleka Xhosa), and through shrewd and successful management of regional trade, formed a developed and materially successful nation. In addition, many bought farms and started businesses in the small towns that were springing up in that part of the Cape frontier.

===The Cattle-killing movement (1856–58)===
{{main|History of Cape Colony from 1806 to 1870#Xhosa cattle-killing movement and famine (1854-58)}}
The Fengu people did not take part in the [[History of Cape Colony from 1806 to 1870#Xhosa cattle-killing movement and famine (1854-1858)|great cattle-killing]] in 1857, which devastated the [[Xhosa people]].

While the Xhosa slaughtered their own cattle and burnt their crops, many of the Fengu people instead bought the Xhosa cattle at very low prices, only to resell them at a profit during the subsequent famine. They also were recorded as producing large excesses of grain at this time for their starving neighbours. The famine induced by the cattle-killing effectively brought much of the armed resistance in the eastern Cape to an end.

===The Fengu-Gcaleka War (1877–79)===
Over a decade of relative peace and economic development, which peaked in the mid-1870s, was brought to an end by a series of devastating droughts across the Transkei, which began to place severe strain on intertribal relations. Their severity increased up until 1877, when the last major war that the Fengu people fought, the [[Xhosa Wars|Ninth Frontier War]], broke out after a bar fight between Fengu and Gcaleka guests, at a Fengu wedding. Many Fengu people were Cape citizens by this time, so the Cape Colony took a partisan view of the war, which brought it into conflict with the Gcaleka forces.&lt;ref&gt;J. Fage, R. Oliver: ''The Cambridge History of Africa'', Volume 6 (1870–1905). Cambridge University Press, 1985, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://eprints.ru.ac.za/1761/1/Spicer-MA-TR78-38.pdf |title=The War of Ngcayecibi 1877 - 8|first=Michael W. |last=Spicer |accessdate=2013-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312212856/http://eprints.ru.ac.za/1761/1/Spicer-MA-TR78-38.pdf |archivedate=12 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Bundy: ''The Rise and Fall of South African Peasantry''. University of California Press, 1979, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cape government appointed the Fengu Captain Bikitsha to co-lead the Cape's forces (composed primarily of Fengu, Thembu and Boer commandos) in the war. They inflicted a string of crushing defeats on the enemy and dispersed their armies in the space of only three weeks. The ingratitude of the British governor [[Sir Henry Bartle Frere]], who promptly humiliated the Cape's Fengu allies by forcibly disarming them, caused the Fengu to begin to identify more with the Xhosa, partly also as a reaction to increasing persecution from the Colonial authorities.

===Transkei and Ciskei===
{{see|Ciskei|Transkei}}
The Fengu lived in the [[Bantustan]]s of [[Transkei]] and [[Ciskei]], established by the [[Apartheid]] government. Ciskei was the scene of political rivalry between the [[Rharhabe]] and the Fengu as a result of the apartheid policy of "retribalisation", which resulted in resentment toward the historically better educated, and relatively economically advantaged Fengu, and this rivalry culiminated in the election of [[Lennox Sebe]], a Rharhabe, who replaced Fengu leader [[Chief Justice Thandathu Jongilizwe Mabandla]] in 1973,&lt;ref name="Vail1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vail|first=Leroy |title=The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4VmAWdXPD0C&amp;pg=PA398|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-07420-0|page=398|chapter=Mfengu-Rharhabe Rivalry and the Rise of Lennox Sebe}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Sebe subsequently abandoned his anti-Fengu rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Vail1991" /&gt;{{rp|402}}

== Christianity in the Fengu community==
Christianity played a major role in the survival of the endangered Fengu people after the [[Mfecane]] wars. After contact with the Gcaleka Xhosa, who were hostile towards them, the Fengu people found comfort in Rev. John Ayliff, the missionary at Butterworth who devoted himself to the tribe for the next 30 years. In 1835, Ayliff led 17 000 and 22 000 head of cattle to Peddie&lt;ref name="SundklerSteed2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sundkler|first1=Bengt |last2=Steed|first2=Christopher |title=A History of the Church in Africa|url={{google books|plainurl=yes|id=y1p61xARWY4C|keywords=Fingo}}|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58342-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;On the 14 May 1835, the Fengu people gathered under an old milkwood tree in the Peddie district, in the presence of Rev. John Ayliff, and swore an oath to obey the Queen, to accept Christianity, and to educate their children. This agreement became known as the 'Fingo-Oath'. Soon after accepting Christianity, the Fengu became the first Bantu in South Africa to use ploughs, demonstrated to them by the missionaries, and also the first to plant wheat.&lt;ref name="FingoHistorynewza"&gt;{{cite news|title= Fingo leaders gather at Peddie | publisher=South African History Online| url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/fingo-leaders-gather-peddie| accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small group moved to Tsitsikamma and carried their Christian customs with them. The Fengu, who were most Wesleyans, soon moved to Grahamstown where they fought on the side of the British in the eighth frontier war of 1850 to 1853 and were rewarded with land in a freehold village known as Fingo in Grahamstown in 1855.&lt;ref name="FingoHistorynew"&gt;{{cite news | last= J.

Nuttall |title=Grahamstown's Fingo Village: From Poverty to Paradise? | publisher=Reality Publications, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa | url=http://disa.ukzn.ac.za/rejul727| accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The educated Fengu went as far as [[Port Elizabeth]], where they worked at the harbour and established urban communities in Cape Town, where they also continued practising as Christians. Since the day the 'Fingo-Oath' was sworn, the 14 May has been celebrated as Fingo Emancipation Day and a ceremony held under the old milkwood tree where the oath was sworn.&lt;ref name="FingoHistorynewza"&gt;{{cite news|title= Fingo leaders gather at Peddie | publisher=South African History Online| url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/fingo-leaders-gather-peddie| accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fengu people in Zimbabwe==
After the occupation of Matebeleland in 1893, the Ndebele took up arms in an effort to re-establish the Ndebele State in 1896. [[ Cecil John Rhodes]] brought a group of Fengu fighters (who had fought on the side of the British) and were derogatively known as "the Cape Boys" in 1896. After the war, Rhodes tried further to 'neutralise' the 'war-like' Ndebele people by inviting more Fengu people into Southern Rhodesia. He promised the Fengus three reserves that each man would work for three months a year, and after 36 months of labour, each would be given land. More Fengu leaders moved to Southern Rhodesia as Wesleyan Methodists, Salvationists, Anglicans, Presbyterians and Lutherans. In 2000, the Mbembesi Fengu/Xhosa community celebrated their centenary in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="Nyathi2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nyathi|first=Pathisa|title=Zimbabwe's Cultural Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xw8AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT94|year=2008|publisher=amabooks|isbn=978-0-7974-4504-8|pages=94–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fengu in Zimbabwe, who are Xhosa speakers, are the subject of the first ever PHD thesis written in Xhosa by Dr Hleze Kunju titled IsiXhosa ulwimi lwabantu abangesosininzi eZimbabwe: Ukuphila nokulondolozwa kwaso (Xhosa as a Minority Language in Zimbabwe: Survival and Maintenance) &lt;ref name="Fingozimbo2"&gt;{{cite news|title= PhD in Xhosa a real milestone| publisher= Herald Live| url=http://www.heraldlive.co.za/news/2017/04/24/phd-xhosa-real-milestone/| accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veldtman Bikitsha (1829–1912)===
For much of the 19th and early 20th century, the Fengu were led by Captain Veldtman Bikitsha. Initially a constable who was of great service to the Cape in the 8th Frontier War, he was later promoted and served as a de facto military leader of the Cape's Fengu commandos.

Prime Minister [[John Molteno]], who held a  very high opinion of Bikitsha, appointed him as a leader of the Cape forces (together with Chief Magistrate Charles Griffith) in the 9th Frontier War in 1877, where he swiftly won a string of brilliant victories against the [[Gcaleka]]. Throughout the 9th Frontier war, Bikitsha and his location were a focal point for the Gcaleka armies attacks and came under immense military pressure.

His military genius in the frontier wars earned him considerable renown and he was widely acknowledged leader in the [[Cape Colony]]. His courage was also frequently referred to. He famously once jumped onto a wounded and charging lion, holding it by the tail, overpowered it and killed it. He was invited to London in 1889, where [[Queen Victoria]] requested to meet him to thank him for his services. He reputedly told her ''"We have never feared a white man, and we have never lifted our hand against any of your people."''

He founded the Transkei General Council, and served as a juror and commissioner for the Cape Colony in later life&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ancestry24.com/veldtman-bikitsha/ |title=Veldtman Bikitsha|work=ancestry24.com

===John Tengo Jabavu (1859–1921)===
[[File:John Tengo Jabavu and his son Davidson Don Tengo, around 1903.jpg|thumb|[[John Tengo Jabavu]], an influential Fengu politician of the early 20th century, with his son Davidson Don Tengo, around 1903]]
As Fengu history switched from military defense to political struggle, so the great Fengu politician and activist [[John Tengo Jabavu]] rose in prominence after Bikitsha's military leadership ended. 

Jabavu edited the first newspapers to be written in the [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and from 1876 he edited ''[[Xhosa language newspapers#Isigidimi samaXhosa|Isigidimi samaXhosa]]'' ("The Xhosa Messenger"). From 1884 he edited ''[[Xhosa language newspapers#Imvo Zabantsundu|Imvo Zabantsundu]]'' ("Black Opinion"). He wrote on the threat of [[Afrikaner]] [[nationalism]], equal rights for South Africa's black population, and in support of [[women's rights]]. 

The rivalry between the Fengu and the Gcaleka Xhosa, which had previously broken out into war, declined during the era of Jabavu's leadership, as greater unity was encouraged. Nonetheless, some divisions remained. Jabavu's main political rival, [[Walter Rubusana]], was Xhosa. Rubusana's rise in the 1890s was through the new Gcaleka-dominated [[South African Native National Congress]] and their newspaper ''[[Xhosa language newspapers#Izwi Labantu|Izwi Labantu]]'' ("The Voice of the People") which was financed by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. The rise of Xhosa institutions meant that Jabavu and the Fengu were no longer in a position to provide the only leadership in the Cape's Black community. 

Over the next few decades, divisions persisted between Jabavu's movement ''[[Imbumba]]'' ("The Union") and Rubusana's [[South African Native National Congress]]. However the rivalry was finally laid to rest and there was union under the newly named [[African National Congress]]. One of the early aims of this movement was finally to lay to rest "the aberrations of the Xhosa-Fingo feud."&lt;ref&gt;M.Plaut: ''Promise and Despair: The First Struggle for a Non-racial South Africa''. Jacana, Cape Town. 2016. {{ISBN|978-1-4314-2375-0}}. p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Arrival of the Mfengu in the Eastern Cape", ''Illustrated History of South Africa.'' The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd, 1992, p. 107. {{ISBN|0-947008-90-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British annexation===
British Kaffraria had been annexed to the Cape Colony in 1866. Barring the brief revolt in 1877 and 1878, when the Gcaleka turned upon their Fengu neighbours, the British annexation of land east of the Kei River proceeded fitfully, but generally unimpeded. In September 1879 this was followed by Idutywa Reserve and Fenguland, and Gcalekaland in 1885. It is assumed that the restructuring of these territories into the divisions of Butterworth, Idutywa, Centani, Nqamakwe, Tsomo and Willowvale dates from these times.

===Social change and adaptability===
Originally farmers, the Fengu people had quickly built themselves schools, created and edited their own newspapers, and translated international literature into their language. The reason that the Fengu people were able to adapt so effectively to changing circumstances (like the coming of capitalism and urbanisation) was because they lacked a fixed tribal social-structure and hierarchy (having presumably lost it in their earlier flight from the Zulu). This state of social change and flexibility allowed them to quickly adjust to the European expansion, learn and adapt new techniques, and take advantage of the upheavals that followed. Other tribes were often suspicious of outside ideas and consequently resisted any change to meet the colonial threat. The Fengu had no paramount-chief as other tribes did, but the Cape Commander, Veldman Bikitsha, was a Fengu and held authority over the Fengu's military capacity.

Many Fengu have also subsequently intermarried with other ethnic groups, particularly with the Xhosa and Zulu, while some still live in Zimbabwe.

==Territory==
[[File:Fingoland - Eastern Cape Map - 1911.png|thumb|right|Map of Fingoland (highlighted), and surrounding regions of the Eastern Cape Frontier. 1911.]]
The region that was later known as the [[Transkei]] was originally divided into territories known as the Idutywa Reserve, [[Fingoland]] and Galekaland (Gcalekaland). Fingoland lay the borderlands in the far south of the Transkei, just north of the [[Kei River]].

Following their annexation by the [[British Empire|British]] however, they were restructured into the divisions of Butterworth, Tsomo and Ngqamakwe for Fingoland; Centani and Willowvale for Galekaland; and Idutywa for the Idutywa Reserve.

==Present-day South Africa ==
Today virtually all the Fengu people have intermarried with other ethnic groups particularly with the Xhosa and Zulu. Many are now often considered – especially by outsiders – to be ethnically [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and others [[Zulu people|Zulu]], because of their common language and some similar customs. A considerable number have a mixed racial background, especially in and around the Cape provinces.

{{Romani people}}
The '''[[Gypsies]] in Spain''', generally known as '''''gitanos''''' ({{IPA-es|xiˈtanos}}), belong to the [[Iberian Kale]] [[Romani people#Population and subgroups|group]], with smaller populations in [[Portugal]] (known as ''[[ciganos]]'') and in southern [[France]]. They tend to speak [[Caló (Spanish Romani)|Caló]], which basically encompasses a range of regional dialects of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] with numerous [[Romani language|Romani]] loan words and mannerisms. Nevertheless, to varying degrees, they identify with [[Andalusia]]n culture and music due to the large and culturally significant ''gitano'' population present in that region. Data on ethnicity is not collected in Spain, although the Government's statistical agency CIS estimated in 2007 that the number of Gitanos present in Spain is probably around one million.&lt;ref name="Diagnostico Social de la Comunidad Gitana en Espana - CIS"/&gt;

==Name==
The term "gitano" evolved from the word "egiptano"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dirae.es/palabras/egiptano|title=egiptano - Diccionario Dirae.|website=Dirae.es|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Egyptian"), the [[Old Spanish]] demonym for someone from "Egipto" (Egypt). "Egiptano" was the regular adjectival form for someone from Egypt, however, in Middle and Modern Spanish the irregular adjectival form "egipcio" supplanted "egiptano" to mean Egyptian, while "gitano" went on to refer specifically to Romanis in Spain.

The etymological meaning of the term "gitano", therefore, was originally "Egyptian".&lt;ref name="buscon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/drae/?type=3&amp;val=gitano&amp;val_aux=&amp;origen=REDRAE |title=Diccionario de la lengua española - Vigésima segunda edición |publisher=Buscon.rae.es |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the Spanish word "gitano" to refer to Romanis in Spain evolved from "egiptano" in the same way that the English word "[[Gypsy (term)|Gypsy]]" evolved from the term "Egyptian" to refer to Romanis. Both terms are due to some Romanis, upon their first arrivals to Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries, claiming to be Egyptians for a more favourable treatment by local Europeans, or being mistaken as [[Egyptians]] by local Europeans.

While it is now known that Romanis are ultimately of northwestern [[Hindustan]]i origin (an area today shared between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]), many did enter Europe via a generations-long migration which included [[Egypt]] as one of their last stops before their arrival into Europe.

It is for this same reason that in the [[Albanian language]] variations of the Albanian term for "Egyptian" are still used to refer to a people which in English are known as [[Balkan Egyptians]]. This group of Romanis in Albania are likewise of northwestern Hindustani origin, and are not related to Egyptians proper.

==Identity==
{{main|Romani society and culture}}
''Gitano'' identity is particularly complex in Spain for a variety of reasons which are examined below. Nevertheless, it can be safely said that both from the perspective of ''gitano'' and non-''gitano'' (''payo'') Spaniards, individuals generally considered to belong to this ethnicity are those of full or near-full ''gitano'' descent and who also self-identify. A confusing element is the thorough hybridization of Andalusian and Roma culture (and some would say identity) at a popular level. This has occurred to the point where Spaniards from other regions of Spain can commonly mistake elements of one for the other. The clearest example of this is [[flamenco]] music and [[Sevillanas]], art forms that are Andalusian rather than ''gitano'' in origin but, having been strongly marked by ''gitanos'' in interpretative style, is now commonly associated to this ethnicity by many Spaniards. The fact that the largest population of ''gitanos'' is concentrated in Southern Spain has even led to a confusion between ''gitano'' accents and those typical of Southern Spain even though many ''Kale'' populations in the northern half of Spain (such as Galicia) do not speak Andalusian Spanish.

Indeed, the boundaries among ''gitano'' and non-''gitano'' ethnicities are so blurred by intermarriage and common cultural traits in the south of the country, that self-identification is on occasion the only real marker for ethnicity. Few Spaniards are aware, for example, that Andalusian singer and ''gitano'' popular icon [[Lola Flores]] was, in fact, not of ''gitano'' ethnicity and did not consider herself as such.&lt;ref name="Ayer fue enterrada Lola Flores - El Tiempo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-328321 |title=Lola Flores Obituary |publisher=El Tiempo |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mistake can be commonly attributed to her being a Flamenco singer of humble origin, with vaguely South Asian physical traits and a strong Andalusian accent, as well as to her having married into a Gitano family.

The term "''gitano''" has also acquired among many a negative socio-economic connotation referring to the lowest strata of society, sometimes linking it to crime and marginality and even being used as a term of abuse. In this, one can be Gitano "by degree" according to how much one fits into pre-conceived stereotypes or social stigmas.

On the other hand, the exaltation of Roma culture and heritage is a large element of wider Andalusian folklore and Spanish identity. Gitanos, rather than being considered a "foreign" or "alien" minority within the country are perceived as "deep" or "real Spain", as is expressed by the term "''España Cañí''" which means both "Gypsy Spain" and "Traditional" or "Folkloric Spain". This is largely the result of the period of romantic nationalism which followed the Spanish war of independence, during which the values of the Enlightenment arriving from Western Europe were rejected and Gypsies became the symbol of Spanish traditionalism, independence and racial consciousness.

Evidently, all this results in a strong distinction between ''gitanos'' and Rom immigrants from Eastern Europe, who are commonly identified by the wider population according to their country of origin (normally Romanians or Bulgarians) rather than by their actual Rom ethnicity.

==History==
Historical records show that Spanish Gitanos arrived in Spain at the 15th-century through Europe concentrating in Andalusia and adopting the region's unique hybrid culture as their own, highlighting the [[Flamenco]] music whose origins dates to late-18th-century. At first they were well received and were even accorded official protection by many local authorities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that roots of Romani language lie in the [[Indian subcontinent]]: the language has grammatical characteristics of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic languages]] and shares with them a big part of the basic lexicon, for example, body parts, daily routines&lt;ref name="mluvnice"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Šebková | first1 = Hana | last2 = Žlnayová | first2 = Edita | year = 1998 | url = http://rss.archives.ceu.hu/archive/00001112/01/118.pdf | title = Nástin mluvnice slovenské romštiny (pro pedagogické účely) | place = Ústí nad Labem | publisher = Pedagogická fakulta Univerzity J.

More exactly, Romani shares the basic lexicon with [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. It shares many phonetic features with [[Marwari (language)|Marwari]], while its grammar is closest to [[Bengali language|Bengali]].&lt;ref name="hub1995"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Milena|last=Hübschmannová|title=Romaňi čhib – romština: Několik základních informací o romském jazyku|journal=Bulletin Muzea romské kultury|issue=4/1995|year= 1995 |publisher= Muzeum romské kultury|place=Brno|quote=Zatímco romská lexika je bližší hindštině, marvárštině, pandžábštině atd., v gramatické sféře nacházíme mnoho shod s východoindickým jazykem, s bengálštinou.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic evaluation carried out in the nineteenth century by Pott (1845) and Miklosich (1882–1888) showed that the [[Romani language]] is to be classed as a New Indo-Aryan language (NIA), not a Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA), establishing that the ancestors of the Romani could not have left the Indian subcontinent significantly earlier than AD 1000, then finally reaching Europe several hundred years later.

Genetic findings in 2012 suggest the Romani originated in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent and migrated as a group.&lt;ref name="IsabelMendizabal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.livescience.com/40652-facts-about-roma-romani-gypsies.html|title=5 Intriguing Facts About the Roma|work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration to Spain===

How and when the gypsies arrived in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from [[North India|Northern]] [[India]] is a question whose consensus is far from being reached. A popular theory, although without any documentation, claims they come from from North Africa, from where they would have crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to meet again in France with the northern migratory route.&lt;ref&gt;http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=1110754&amp;orden=33593&amp;info=link&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the [[Tingitana Peninsula|Tingitanis]] (in its deformed pronunciation, ''gitanos'', that is, from Tingis, today [[Tangier]]). Another, more consistent theroy, and well documented, is that they entered the Iberian Peninsula from France. Although, there is controversy of the date of the first arrival, since there is evidence of a safe conduct granted in [[Perpignan]] in 1415 by the infante Alfonso of Aragon to one Tomás, son of  Bartolomé de Sanno, who is said to be "Indie Majoris".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url = =http://195.220.134.232/numerisation/tires-a-part-www-nb/0000005430031.pdf | title = “Pèlerins d’Espagne a la fin de Moten âge”| author =Jeanne VIELLIEARD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or instead, could be the so-called Juan de Egipto Menor, who entered through France, who in 1425 [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso V]] granted him a letter of insurance, which is mostly accepted as the first gypsy to reach the peninsula.

{{Quote |... As our beloved and devoted Don Juan de Egipto Menor ... understands that he must pass through some parts of our kingdoms and lands, and we want him to be well treated and welcomed ... under pain of our wrath and indignation ... the mentioned Don Juan de Egipto and those who will go with him and accompany him, with all their horses, clothes, goods, gold, silver, saddlebags and whatever else they bring with them, let them go, stay and go through any city, town, place and other parts of our lordship safe and secure ... and giving those safe passage and being driven when the aforementioned don Juan requires it through this present safe conduct ... Delivered in Zaragoza with our seal on January 12 of the year of birth of our Lord 1425. [[Alfonso V of Aragon|King Alfonso]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unionromani.org/docgit.htm  Unión Romaní].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1435 they were seen in [[Santiago de Compostela]], Gitanos were recorded in [[Barcelona]] and [[Zaragoza]] by 1447{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}, and in 1462 they were received with honors in [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]]. Years later, to the gitanos, the ''[[Greeks|grecianos]]'', pilgrims who penetrated the Mediterranean shore in the 1480s, were added to them, probably because of the [[fall of Constantinople]].  Both of them continued to wander throughout the peninsula, being well received at least until 1493, year in which a group of ''gitanos'' arrived at [[Madrid]], where the Council agreed to "''... give alms to the ''gitanos'' because at the request of the City passed ahead, ten reales, to avoid the damages that could be done by three hundred people who came ... "''.

In those years safe conducts were granted to supposedly noble gypsy pilgrims. The follow-up of these safe-conducts throughout Spain has provided some data to historians according to Teresa San Román:

* The number of gypsies that entered or inhabited the Peninsula in the 15th-century is estimated at approximately 3,000 individuals.
* The gypsies traveled in variable groups, of 80-150 people, led by a man.
* Each autonomous group maintained relations at a distance with one of the others, there being perhaps relations of kinship among them (something common in today among Spanish gypsies).
* The separation between each group was variable and sometimes some followed the others at close range and by the same routes.
* The most common survival strategy was to present as Christian pilgrims to seek the protection of a noble.
* The way of life was nomadic and dedicated to divination and performance (spectacle).

In 1492, gipsy auxiliaries helped the army of the [[Kingdom of Castile and León]] in the Reconquista in [[Granada]] ending the reign of muslims in Spain.&lt;ref name="dhier"&gt;{{Citation | page = 53 | url = https://hera.ugr.es/tesisugr/16795015.pdf | title = La condición social y jurídica de los gitanos en la legislación histórica española | place = Universidad de Granada | author = Alejandro Martínez Dhier }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gitanos'' have a low and little politically committed role, with some particular exceptions, in Andalusian nationalism and identity, which is strongly based on a belief in the oriental basis of Andalusi heritage acted as a bridge between occidental-western and oriental-eastern Andalusian culture at a popular level.  The father of such a movement, [[Blas Infante]], in his book ''Orígenes de lo flamenco y secreto del cante jondo'', [[Etymology|etymologically]], went as far as alleging that the word ''flamenco'' derives from [[Andalusian Arabic]] ''fellah mengu'', supposedly meaning "escapee peasant". Infante believed that numerous Muslim Andalusians became [[Moriscos]], who were obliged to convert, dispersed and eventually ordered to leave Spain stayed and mixed with the Romani newcomers instead of abandoning their land. These claims have been rejected by many historians{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} and genetic research papers.&lt;ref name="gusmao"&gt;{{Citation | pmid = 18205888 | title = A perspective on the history of the Iberian gypsies provided by phylogeographic analysis of Y-chromosome lineages | place = Annals of Human Genetics | publisher = Wiley Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For about 300 years, Romanies were subject to a number of laws and policies designed to eliminate them from Spain as an identifiable group{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}: Romani settlements were broken up and the residents dispersed; sometimes, Romanies were required to marry non-Roma; they were prohibited from using their language and rituals, and were excluded from public office and from guild membership.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In 1749 A major effort to get rid of the gypsy population in Spain was carried out through a [[Great Gypsy Round-up|raid]] organized by the government.  It arrested all gypsies (Romani) in the realm, and imprisoned them in jails, eventually releasing them due to the widespread discontent that the measure caused.

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], ''gitanos'' were not persecuted for their ethnicity by either side.  Under Franco, Gitanos were often harassed or simply ignored, although their children were educated, sometimes forcibly, much as all Spaniards are nowadays. On the other hand, Andalusian and ''gitano'' culture was instrumentalized in the country's tourist promotion strategy which focused on the south to exalt the uniqueness of Spanish culture. However, the country's industrialization negatively affected ''gitanos'' as the migration of rural Spaniards to major cities led to the growth of shanty towns around urban areas with a consequent explosion in birth rates and a drastic fall in the quality of living and an abandonment of traditional professions. Traditional Gitano neighbourhoods such as [[Triana, Seville|Triana]] in Seville became gentrified and ''gitanos'' were slowly pushed out to the periphery and these new shanty towns.

In the post-Franco era, Spanish government policy has been much more sympathetic, especially in the area of social welfare and social services.  In 1977, the last anti-Romani laws were repealed, an action promoted by [[Juan de Dios Ramírez Heredia]], the first Romani deputy.

Since 1983, the government has operated a special program of [[Compensatory Education]] to promote educational rights for the disadvantaged, including those in Romani communities. During the heroin epidemic that afflicted Spain in the 80s and 90s, Gitano shanty towns became central to the drug trade, a problem which afflicts Spain to this day. Although the size of shanty towns has been vastly reduced in Madrid, they remain significant in other major cities such as Seville, Huelva and Almería. Nevertheless, Spain is still considered a model for integration of ''gitano'' communities when compared to other countries with Rom populations in Eastern Europe.

Many Spanish Romanies have been converted to [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christianity]] by US-funded religious organizations. However, the bulk of ''gitanos'' in Andalusia remain strongly faithful to the region's [[Catholic]] traditions such as the cult of the Virgin of the Rocío.

==Religion==
In Spain, ''gitanos'' were traditionally [[Roman Catholic]]s who participated in four of the Church's sacraments (baptism, [[marriage]], [[confirmation]], and [[extreme unction]]).  They are not regular churchgoers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} They rarely go to folk healers{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}, and they participate fully in Spain's state-supported medical system. Gitanos have a special involvement with recently dead kin and visit their graves frequently.  They spend more money than non-Gitanos of equivalent economic classes in adorning grave sites.{{Citation needed|reason=Mar 2010|date=March 2010}}

The Spanish [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Federation (mostly composed by members of the [[Assemblies of God]] and [[Pentecostal]]) claims that 150,000 Gitanos have joined their faith in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferede.org/general.php?pag=vernoticia&amp;cod=1086 "Evangelics fish faithful in catholic crisis"]; FEREDE, October 2008 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|reason=this seems to be a conjecture.|date=November 2009}} The Romani Evangelical Assembly is the only religious institution entirely led and composed by Roma.

==Marriage==
[[File:Ramón Carazo Martinez Marta y Maria.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Marta and María, both [[Granada]]n Gitanas, by Ramón Carazo Martinez, late-19th-century.]]
The traditional Spanish Romani place a high value on the extended family. [[Virginity]] is essential in unmarried women. Both men and women often marry young.

A traditional ''gitano'' wedding requires a ''pedimiento'' (similar to an engagement party) followed by the ''casamiento'' (wedding ceremony), where ''[[el yeli]]'' must be sung to the bride for giving her honor to her husband (proven by the ritual of the ''pañuelo''). In the pañuelo ritual,  a group consisting of an ''ajuntaora'' (an elder woman who is well respected in the family), along with the older aunts and elder woman of the family, take the bride into a separate room during the wedding and examine her to ascertain that she is a virgin. The "ajuntaora" is the one who practices the ritual on the bride, as the other women watch to be witnesses that the bride is virgin.

The cloth (''pañuelo'') must have three rose petals on it.  When finished with the exam, the women come out of the room and sing ''el yeli'' to the couple. During this, the men at the wedding rip their shirts and lift the wife onto their shoulders and do the same with the husband, as they sing "el yeli" to them. Weddings can last very long; up to three days is usual in the Gitano culture. At weddings, "gitanos" invite everyone and anyone that they know of (especially other ''gitanos''). On some occasions, ''payos'' (''gadjos'') may attend as well, although this is not common. Through the night, many ''bulerías'' are danced and especially sung.  Today, ''rumba gitana'' or ''rumba flamenca'' are a usual party music fixture.

==Crime issues==
According to the website of Fundación Secretariado Gitano ("Gitano Secretariat Foundation"), in the Spanish prison system the Spanish Romani women represent 25% of the incarcerated feminine population, while Spanish Romani people represent 1.4% of the total Spanish population. 64% of the detentions of gitano people are drug trafficking-related. 93.2% of women inmates for drug trafficking are ''gitanas''. 13.2% of the total drug trafficking-related inmates are of gitano ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gitanos.org/sastipen/healt01/sastipen/isirs-es.htm |title=Informe sobre el Sistema de Información "Red Sastipen" |publisher=Gitanos.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
The Gitanos in Spanish society have inspired several authors:

The '''Great Rites Controversy''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{lang|zh|大禮議}}) took place in the decade following 1524 in [[Ming China]]. It pitted the young and newly enthroned [[Jiajing Emperor]] against the [[Grand Secretary]] [[Yang Tinghe]] and the majority of the [[scholar-bureaucrat|Confucian officials]] in his government.

The Jiajing Emperor had succeeded his first cousin, the [[Zhengde Emperor]] after the latter died childless. His uncle, the [[Hongzhi Emperor]], had not left any other surviving children either. In order to perform the proper rituals owed him according to tradition, it was necessary that the Jiajing Emperor be posthumously adopted by his late uncle who has been dead for nearly two decades. The Jiajing Emperor was reluctant to do this partly because he feared the influence of the Hongzhi Emperor's surviving wife, [[Empress Zhang (Hongzhi)|Empress Dowager Zhang]]. In this he had the support of his biological mother, who was angered by the prospect that her son could be removed from her by adoption. &lt;ref&gt;Adler, Joseph. "[http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Writings/Wilson.htm The Confucian Body]". ''China Review Intl.'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The conflict between the emperor backed by his mother and officialdom backed by the empress dowager was finally broken by [[memorials to the throne]] (namely, by newly qualified scholar-bureaucrats Zhang Cong and Gui E) arguing that rituals performed contrary to the emperor's own heart would be against human nature. Encouraged by this, gradually Emperor Jiajing fostered the idea of "ascending the clan but not the lineage" and grew more presumptuous.

The core counter-argument to Emperor Jiajing's claim, supported by a large majority of court officials, had to do with the imperial treatment of the Zhengde Emperor and his widow [[Empress Xia (Ming dynasty)|Empress Xia]]. The couple together had passed the throne to their cousin instead of an adopted child of their own, in favor of their mother-in-law. As a matter of fact, Emperor Jiajing's grandfather [[Emperor Chenghua]] had other great-grandsons and this was brought up in the discussion of royal succession with the empress dowager, prior to summoning Emperor Jiajing to Beijing in her name. 

Emperor Jiajing decided to allow his own father [[Zhu Youyuan]], the late Prince Xian of Xing, to be posthumously elevated to the status of emperor and particularly be granted seniority over Zhengde Emperor, who was the late prince's sovereign during his life. Prime Minister Yang Tinghe was forced into retirement; his son [[Yang Shen]] who led the counter-argument &lt;ref&gt;Leonard, Andrew.&lt;!--sic--&gt; "[http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2007/06/25/chinese_green_algae/index.html Invasion of the Great Green Algae Monster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628104431/http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2007/06/25/chinese_green_algae/index.html |date=2009-06-28 }}. ''Salon''. 25 Jun 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; was sent to exile and nearly murdered on the way. By the end of Emperor Jiajing's one-sided settlement, enemies and dissenters at court were beaten (sometimes to death), imprisoned, or banished. According to the histories this marked the beginning of the young emperor's authoritarian rule.

[[File:4October1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Members of the {{lang|de|Edelweiss II}} weather station taken prisoner by American soldiers]]
The [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|fall of Denmark]] in April 1940 left the [[Denmark|Danish]] colony of [[Greenland]] an unoccupied territory of an occupied nation, under threat of seizure by the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Canada]]. To forestall this, the United States acted to guarantee Greenland's position. However, with the entrance of the [[United States]] into the war in December 1941, Greenland became a combatant.

From 1941 until 1945, the United States established numerous and extensive facilities for air and sea traffic in Greenland, as well as radio beacons, radio stations, weather stations, ports, depots, artillery posts, and search-and-rescue stations. The [[United States Coast Guard]] also provided a considerable portion of the civilian resupply task up and down both coasts.

Economically, Greenland traded successfully with the United States, Canada, and [[Portugal]], which, supplemented by the [[cryolite]] exports, caused a reanimation and permanent realignment of the island's economy.

==Neutrality==
Before the war, Greenland was a tightly controlled colony of Denmark, otherwise closed off to the world. After the [[Operation Weserübung|invasion of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940, Greenland was left on its own, because the [[Royal Navy]] seized any ships arriving from Axis-controlled Europe. The United Kingdom and Canada initially laid plans to occupy points of interest on the island, but the United States, still neutral, firmly rejected "third party" intervention there. The sheriffs ("landsfogeder") of South and North Greenland, [[Eske Brun]] and Aksel Svane, invoking the emergency clause of a 1925 law specifying how Greenland was ruled, declared Greenland a self-ruling territory, believing this to be in the best interests of the colony as Denmark was occupied by [[Germany]]. This step was taken in coordination with the Danish ambassador to the United States, [[Henrik Kauffmann]], and the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]], and comported with the American declaration of 1920 that no third nation would necessarily be accepted as a sovereign in Greenland. This diplomatic stance was seen as an extension of the [[Monroe Doctrine]].&lt;ref name=Walling6&gt;Walling (2004), p 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Danish government continued in power and still considered itself neutral, it was forced to obey German wishes in foreign policy matters. Kauffmann immediately recognized that his government was unable to exercise its full sovereignty, and therefore began to act in an independent capacity. On 13 April he took council with the Greenland sheriffs, and after some controversy they agreed to recognize him as their representative in the United States. Since the United States would not offer diplomatic recognition and aid to Greenland unless the local administration was independent, the sheriffs informed the local advisory parliament ("Landsraad") on 3 May that "there was no choice" but to act as a sovereign nation. The Danish Government continued to send orders to the colony via radio and through Portugal, but these messages were ignored.&lt;ref name=Howarth8&gt;Howarth, p 8&lt;/ref&gt; In this decision they were influenced by their determination to avoid becoming subject to a Canadian occupation and thus being drawn into the war.&lt;ref name=Walling6 /&gt;

The Greenlanders were also aware of the heavy [[Little Norway|Norwegian presence]] in Canada. In the event that Canada attempted to occupy the colony, they were worried that [[Free Norwegian Forces]] would be stationed in the area.&lt;ref name= Zabecki628 /&gt; This was a cause for concern, as the Norwegians had been vying for control over part of the territory until the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] settled the dispute in 1933.&lt;ref name=PCIJ&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/serie_AB/AB_53/01_Groenland_Oriental_Arret.pdf ''Legal Status of Eastern Greenland''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511135249/http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/serie_AB/AB_53/01_Groenland_Oriental_Arret.pdf |date=11 May 2011 }}, PCIJ Series A/B No. 53 (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they requested the protection of the United States, whose [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] agreed to dispatch the US Coast Guard vessels, {{USCGC|Comanche|WPG-76|6}} and {{USCGC|Campbell|WPG-32|6}} with supplies and a consular team to establish a provisional [[consulate]] at [[Nuuk|Godthaab]]. Accepting the protection of the Americans, a third party, was seen as less of a threat to Greenland's sovereignty.&lt;ref name= Zabecki628 /&gt; ''Comanche'' arrived at [[Ivittuut|Ivigtut]] on 20 May, and Godthaab on 22 May, thereby establishing direct diplomatic relations with Greenland.&lt;ref name=Walling6 /&gt; Canada sent a consul and vice-consul to Godthaab two weeks later.

[[Image:Cryolite mine ivgtut greenland.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[Ivigtut]] cryolite mine in southwestern Greenland, 1940]]
In 1940, the chief concern of all interested parties was to secure the strategically important supply of [[cryolite]] from the mine at Ivigtut. Cryolite was a key component used in the production of aluminum. Due to diplomatic considerations, no American soldiers could be used to protect the mines so the US State Department recruited fifteen Coast Guardsmen who were voluntarily discharged and in turn hired by the mine as guards. Three-inch naval deck guns were supplied by ''Campbell'' and the recently arrived {{USCGC|Northland|WPG-49|6}} along with eight machine guns, fifty rifles, and thousands of rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref name=Walling8&gt;Walling (2004), p 8&lt;/ref&gt; In this way the United States maintained neutrality and still preempted British-Canadian plans for the island.

The Dane, Eske Brun, decided that Greenland should untertake its own measures to ensure its sovereignty. He made an appeal to the Greenland's guides and hunters to join an elite unit tasked with patrolling the most remote areas of the colony.&lt;ref name=Zabecki628&gt;Zabecki, p 628&lt;/ref&gt; Using the rifles left by the Americans, he directed the creation of what became the [[Slædepatruljen Sirius|Sirius Sledge Patrol]]. The 15 man volunteer team was made up of native [[Inuit]], Danish colonists, and Norwegian expatriates.&lt;ref name=NP&gt;[http://www.warcovers.dk/greenland/sledgemember.htm Northeast Greenland Sledge Patrol] warcovers.dk&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany made no attempts to reach Greenland in 1940. However, three Norwegian vessels reached Norwegian stations on the East Coast. Two were intercepted by the Royal Navy, one (which was left to go) by the US Coast Guard. Britain violated Greenland neutrality by destroying the Norwegian stations, drawing an American protest, and a German reconnaissance plane made a flight over the East Coast in November in order to check on a Norwegian station that had not been heard from.

In 1941, the situation shifted towards delivery of [[Lend-Lease]] aircraft to Britain via the North Atlantic island "stepping stones." Again, the United Kingdom and Canada pressed for an operation to establish an airfield near [[Cape Farewell, Greenland|Cape Farewell]]. This forced the United States and the Greenland government to formalize an American protectorate in order to preserve the island's neutrality. Following surveys in 1940 and 1941, two locations for air bases were located, and a naval base established close to Ivigtut. The American bases and stations were codenamed under the [[Bluie]] West and Bluie East moniker.

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] took a strong personal interest in Greenland's fate. On 9 April 1941, the anniversary of the German occupation, the Danish envoy Kauffmann, against the instructions of his government, signed an executive agreement with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]], allowing the presence of American troops and making Greenland a ''de facto'' United States protectorate. The cryolite mine in Ivigtut was a unique asset that made it possible for Greenland to manage fairly well economically during the war. The United States supplied the island and sent patrol boats to survey the east coast of Greenland although this activity was limited by seasonal ice. The Coast Guard, in coordination with Eske Brun, created the Northeast Greenland Sledge Patrol, consisting of 15 men, many of them former hunters in the area. Their task was to patrol the coast to discover any German activity. However, in 1941 there was no such landing, although the Norwegian resupply trawler {{SS|Buskø||2}} was encountered in September. Among its otherwise innocuous crew and passengers was a civilian Norwegian who intended to provide weather reports for German contacts in Norway. This ship was seized and brought to Boston.

In 1941, British ships continued to interfere with weather stations on the east coast. A couple of reconnaissance aircraft from Norway flew over [[Scoresbysund]].

== Greenland enters the war ==
When the United States entered the war with Germany on 11 December, Greenland became a warring nation. Remaining contact with Copenhagen was broken off, rationing and daylight saving time was introduced, and local currency and stamps printed. In 1942, the U.S. Army took over protection of the Ivigtut mine, and combat patrols began to be flown from [[Bluie West One]], which became the headquarters for both the Coast Guard [[Greenland Patrol]] and the [[United States Army Air Force]] (USAAF) Greenland Base Command. A third air base was established at [[Bluie East Two]] during the summer. 

The Greenland population, which had been 18,000 natives and fewer than 500 Danes, was augmented by thousands of U.S. servicemen. Relations with the Americans were excellent, as they provided news, provisions, humanitarian aid, and entertainment in addition to greatly expanding the island's infrastructure.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In 1944 a [[1944 Danish 5 Krone coin|five kroner]] coin was struck in Philadelphia, to be used by American soldiers.&lt;ref name=Hengeveld&gt;Hengeveld: Exploring the Coinage of Greenland&lt;/ref&gt; Greenland's commercial interests in North America were maintained by the Greenland Delegation with the aid of Kauffmann and Svane. Brun remained in Greenland as head of a unified administration.

=== German weather stations ===
{{see also|North Atlantic weather war}}
[[File:1944-12-27 Yanks Clear Greenland of Nazis.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=2:18|left|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the 1944 attack on a German weather station]]
Beginning in August 1942, the Germans established four clandestine [[weather station]]s on the east coast. The first expedition on [[Sabine Island]] was detected in the spring, but was withdrawn successfully before it was attacked. The fall 1943 expedition at [[Shannon Island]] also operated successfully over the winter and spring and was withdrawn by air. Two expeditions in October 1944 were seized by the Coast Guard before they could get established.

The German weather station ''Holzauge'' at Hansa Bay on the northeast coast of Sabine Island was discovered by a team from the [[North-East Greenland Sledge Patrol|Sledge Patrol]] on 11 March 1943. The Germans realized they had been discovered, and gave chase to the team, who had to abandon their equipment (including their dog teams) and retreat to the station at [[Eskimonæs]], to warn Ib Poulsen, the Sledge Patrol commander. Poulsen reported the German base to the Greenland government on 13 March 1943, and asked for automatic weapons and further orders. Governor Brun officially designated the patrol the "Army of Greenland" and named Poulsen its captain, effective 15 March.&lt;ref name=Howarth72-90&gt;Howarth, 1957 edition, pp 72&amp;ndash;90&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans attacked Eskimonaes on 23 March. Before help could arrive they seized and burned the station. Though unhurt, the entire Sledge Patrol contingent based there was forced to make a 400-mile trek to the station at [[Ella Island]] without sleds, food, or equipment. On their way back to Sabine, the Germans ambushed a three-man patrol at Sandodden, killing the leader, Corporal Eli Knudsen.&lt;ref name=Zabecki628/&gt;&lt;ref name=Howarth108-156&gt;Howarth, 1957 ed., pp 108&amp;ndash;156&lt;/ref&gt; In late-April, Lieutenant Hermann Ritter, the officer in command of the German detachment &lt;!--acting as head of security for the chief German meteorologist, Dr. Gottfired Weiss--&gt;, was taken prisoner by the Sledge Patrol and brought to the Americans after a long journey to [[Scoresby Sound]].&lt;ref name=Howarth183-211&gt;Howarth, 1957 edition, pp 183&amp;ndash;211&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Callao (IX-205).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''Externsteine'' shortly after its capture by the ''Eastwind'']]
The German base on Sabine was bombed by USAAF bombers from Iceland.&lt;ref name=Howarth210-213&gt;Howarth, pp 210&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; It was then seized by a Coast Guard landing party, but all German personnel save one person had already been evacuated by a [[Dornier Do 26]].&lt;ref name="Dege/Barrxx"&gt;Dege &amp; Barr (2004), p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from fire exchanged between German aircraft and American ships, this was the only offensive air attack on the Greenland mainland. An American air force formation attacked the station on 14 May to make sure it could be of no use to the Germans.&lt;ref name= RM /&gt; Two more skirmishes occurred between the Sledge Patrol and the Germans, leaving the Greenland force with two more dead and four wounded by the end of conflict in 1944.&lt;ref name=Zabecki628/&gt;

The last German weather station, ''Edelweiss II'', was captured by US Army forces and its crew taken prisoner on 4 October 1944. The American troops landed from the icebreaker {{USCGC|Eastwind|WAGB-279|6}}, which later transferred the prisoners to {{USCGC|Storis|WMEC-38|6}}. The German transport ship {{SS|Externsteine||2}}, which was resupplying the station, was seized by ''Eastwind'', renamed ''Eastbreeze'' and commissioned in the United States Coast Guard.&lt;ref name="Dege/Barrxxx"&gt;Dege &amp; Barr (2004), p. xxx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Price&gt;Price; "Arctic Combat: ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenland played an important role in North Atlantic air traffic during the war, but the island's role as a major base for anti-submarine warfare assets was hampered by adverse weather, winter darkness, and difficult logistics. For a long period, a flight of six [[PBY Catalina]]s of VP-6(CG) was maintained at Bluie West One, carrying out a great variety of missions.

==Aftermath==
On 5 May 1945, Greenlanders celebrated the liberation of Denmark in Nuuk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Ebdrup| first = Niels| title = Grønland ville selv afskaffe fanger-kulturen| newspaper = Videnskab dk| location = [[Valby]]|language = Danish|publisher = Videnskab.dk | date = 25 September 2012 | url =http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/gronland-ville-selv-afskaffe-fanger-kulturen| access-date = 11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greenland Administration under Eske Brun surrendered its emergency powers and again came under direct control from Copenhagen. Kauffmann returned to Copenhagen, where treason charges against him were dropped, and the Danish parliament ratified his agreement with the United States. The United States presence continued in decreasing numbers until the Kauffmann-Hull agreement was replaced by a new base treaty in 1951.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;Grant (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} 
The successful experience of an independent Greenland led to a dramatic restructuring and modernization of Danish policy with respect to the colony.

The remains of the police station in Eskimonæs exists to this day. The only fully remaining structure is the outhouse, as it was not burnt by the Germans.&lt;ref name= DH&gt;Howarth. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The rest is well-preserved in the arctic environment.&lt;ref name= RM&gt;Olsen, Bjørnar.

==In fiction==
A scene in the thriller ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' includes an American veteran of the struggle against the German weather stations in Greenland giving a rather fanciful account of his experiences.

The novel ''Ice Brothers'' by former US Coast Guard officer [[Sloan Wilson]] tells of the experiences of the crew and the hardships they faced aboard a small Coast Guard cutter that was part of the Greenland Patrol.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson; ''Ice Brothers''&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at the [[D. J. Science College]], [[Karachi]], and remained a resident boarder in Metharam Hostel attached to the college. He graduated in 1927 with honours in literature and won distinction in [[Persian language|Persian]] from the Bombay University. He served as editor of the college miscellany and won the annual award for writing a poem called "college kabootar" (the college pigeon). Throughout his student life at Larkana and Karachi, he was a scholarship holder.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |title=Baba-E-Sindh Hyder Baksh Jatoi 1901-1970: Introduction and excerpts from his writings |last=Jatoi |first=Dr. Hatim |url=http://www.bibliography.com.pk/bookdetail.php?id=2358 |publisher=Baba-E-Sindh Hyder Baksh Jatoi Academy |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote the poem:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The path to Allah I perceived with difficulty,
Not in mosque, temple or church
No place for thinking or logic anywhere
I saw him truly in my own heart.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hyder Bux Jatoi resigned from the post as deputy collector in the British colonial government in 1945 to lead the Sindh peasants’ rights movement Hyder Bux Jatoi translation of the [[Quran]] in [[Sindhi language|English]].&lt;ref name="tribune.com.pk"/&gt;

== Sindh Hari Committee ==
The subhuman conditions of harees (farmers) and tillers of the land led him to resign from his job in 1945 and to join the Sindh Hari Party.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

He began his career in social service and politics as a member of the Indian National Congress.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''We are now passing through the same stage in the history of our economic life through which the leading nations of Europe passed more than 400 years ago, this showed how backward we were, and have been kept where we are."''&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Death ==
He died on the 21st May 1970 at Hyder Manzil, Hyder chowk, Hyderabad. He had written his epitaph before his death, which was read at his funeral&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;:

Be happy O friend without you rest in life is not possible."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''International Development Design Summit''' is a collaboration to find cost effective technology solutions for the third world. It was first held in 2007 at [[MIT]]. It is held annually to study problems in the developing world and create real, workable solutions to them.&lt;ref name=PCOLMitnews/&gt;

==Background==
"I believe very strongly that solutions to problems in the developing world are best created in collaboration with the people who will be using them", said founder Amy Smith .&lt;ref name=PCOLMitnews/&gt; "By bringing this group of people together, we get an incredibly broad range of backgrounds and experiences.&lt;ref name=PCOLMitnews&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2007/iddesignsummit-0713.html "Making a difference in the developing world"] by Heather Manning, ''MIT News'', July 13, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''WorldChanging'' reported on August 14, 2007 that the results from the first International Development Design Summit (IDDS) had been very positive with end products including an off-grid refrigeration unit tailored for rural areas using an evaporative cooling method to store perishable food and a low-cost greenhouse from recycled and widely available materials.&lt;ref name=PCOLWorldchanging&gt;[http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007106.html "South-South Design Flourishes at MIT Summit"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826185714/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007106.html |date=2007-08-26 }} by Jonathon Greenblatt, ''World Changing''.

[[File:Jeung San Do Logo.png|thumb|150x150px|The symbol of Jeungsanist organisations.]]
'''Jeung San Do''' ({{lang|ko-Hang|증산도}}), occasionally called [[Jeungsanism]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|증산교}} ''Jeungsangyo''), meaning "The Dao/[[Tao]] of Jeung-san", although this term is better reserved for a larger family of movements, is a [[new religious movement]] founded in [[South Korea]] in 1974. It is one of more than 100 Korean religious movements that recognize [[Gang Il-sun]] (강일순) (Kang Jeungsan, or Chungsan), an early 20th century religious leader, as the incarnation and personification of [[Sangje]]nim (上帝任, the "governing spirit of the universe") and performed a "reordering of the universe" through his mission and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Introvigne, [https://wrldrels.org/2017/02/26/daesoon-jinrihoe "Daesoon Jinrihoe"], World Religions and Spiritualities Project, Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion is characterised by a universal message, [[millenarianism]], and a method of healing meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
A number of branches of [[Jeungsanism]] trace their origins to Goh Pan-Lye (Subu, literally “Head Lady,” 1880-1935, although in Kang's circle there was more than one "Subu"), a female disciple of Kang Jeungsan. Around September 1911, Goh gathered around her a number of Kang's followers. Eventually, Goh’s male cousin, Cha Gyeong-Seok (1880-1936), a leading disciple of Kang, became the leader of Goh's branch. Dissatisfied with this situation, Goh separated from Cha in 1919 and established her own new religion.&lt;ref&gt;See Lee Kang-o, “Chungsan-gyo: Its History, Doctrine and Ritual,” ''Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch'' 43 (1967), 28-66 (21); Introvigne, "Daesoon Jinrihoe," cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1920s, Cha’s branch, known as [[Bocheon-gyo]], became the largest Korean new religious movement and possibly the largest religion in Korea, with some six million followers.&lt;ref&gt; Robert Pearson Flaherty, “Korean Millennial Movements,” in ''The Oxford Handbook of Millennialism'', edited by [[Catherine Wessinger]], Oxford: Oxford University Press 2016,{{ISBN|978-01-953010-5-2}}, 326-347 (335).&lt;/ref&gt; It declined rapidly after Cha's death in 1936, and fragmented into several competing group, as did Goh's organization. Jeung San Do is the largest among the branches claiming a lineage originating from Goh. It was founded by Ahn Un-san (born in 1922), who established his first religious organization in 1945. After further divisions, Ahn founded Jeung San Do in 1974 together with his son, Ahn Gyeong-jeon (b. 1954).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeungsando.org/masters/ahn-un-san-his-holiness-the-jongdosanim/ "Taesang Jongdosanism"], official Web site of Jeung San Do.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeung San Do believes that, as Kang was God the Father, Goh, revered with the title of Tae-mo-nim, was God the mother and between 1926 and 1935 performed her own reordering of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.jsd.or.kr/dojeon/readen.php?mid=70 "Sahng-jeh-nim and Tae-mo-nim"], official Web site of Jeung San Do.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeung San Do is the movement within Jeungsanism with the most visible presence abroad, although it is not the largest branch in Korea.&lt;ref&gt; See Introvigne, "Daesoon Jinrihoe," cit.&lt;/ref&gt;
The central text of Jeungsanism, the [[Dojeon]], was first published in [[Korean language|Korean]] in 1992. The name "Dojeon" is used by other branches of Jeungsanism for their own, different sacred texts. Jeung San Do's version contains detailed description of Jeungsan [[Sangje]]nim's and Taemonim's ("Great Mother") lives and of ''Cheonjigongsa'', the "Renewal of Heaven and Earth". The Jeungsanist theory stresses the concept of [[Tao]], the way of nature.

Jeungsanism is often understood as having stemmed from Korean [[Sinism]] and Chinese millenarian [[Taoism]],&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and is defined as one of the Korean [[indigenous religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Jeung San Do'' means "the Way [''dao/do/[[Tao]]'', 道] of the ''Jeung''(甑)[''siru''] ''San''(山)[mountain]". The word "''jeung''" is ''siru'' in Korean, which is Korean food streamer vessel for cooking Korean rice cakes, ''[[Tteok]]''(떡). It signifies a vast vessel by metaphor that can contain everything in the world. To conclude, "''jeung''" (甑) denotes the process of rising, maturation, fruition or growth.

"''Jeung san''" is also a traditional Korean descriptive term for the highest mountain in a region or "steamer mountain".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jeungsando.org/?p=1317&lt;/ref&gt; "''Do''" (道) denotes [[Tao]], the way. Considered as a whole, therefore, the name "''Jeung San Do''" signifies the highest truth that surpasses all existing religions and teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
[[Sangjenim]] means "Highest Emperor", and is cognate of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''[[Shangdi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; It is the governing spirit of the universe, and Jeung San Do believe he was incarnated as [[Gang Il-sun]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;, although God for Jeung San Do also exists as God the mother, incarnated on earth as Goh Pan-Lye.

Jeung San Do teaches that, at the age of seven, Sangjenim attained a sudden spiritual awakening while watching a performance of traditional music and dance. When he was twenty-four, he witnessed the tumultuous events of the [[Donghak]] (Eastern Learning) Uprising in which an ill-equipped but determined army of farmers fought the troops of both the Korean government and the Japanese. This insurrection sparked a war between [[China]] and [[Japan]] fought on the [[Korean peninsula]] and ended with the crushing defeat of the farmers and Japan's annexation of the country. After observing the death and misery brought on by these events, Jeung San Sangjenim resolved to save the world from suffering.

He traveled for three years to observe human behavior and the shape, [[qi]], and spirit of the land. In 1901, after a period of intensive meditation he attained perfect enlightenment into the affairs of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. About this he said:

{{quote|Since ancient times, a few have mastered the writing of the Heavens, a few have mastered the principles of Earth, but no one has mastered the nature of humans. I am the first to master the nature of humans.
: - Dojeon 2:13:4-5}}

In that year, Sangjenim began a spiritual work that cannot be easily explained or understood. It was called the work of renewing Heaven and Earth (天地公事). For nine years, he conducted works of renewal in the form of rituals, proclamations, and conversations with humans and spirits and utilized the ''qi'' of various places and people. He established a federation of gods called the Creative Government, composed of regional gods, the founding spirits of family lines, gods that founded and advanced civilizations, enlightened spirits, spirits with unresolved bitterness and grief, and the spirits of revolutionaries. With this assembly of spirits, he intended to correct the wrongs of the past and chart a new course for the future. His work of renewing Heaven and Earth shifted the course of Heaven, Earth, and humanity and planted the seeds for a new enlightened and harmonious world of humans and gods.

According to his followers, Sangjenim differed from other prophets in that he not only spoke about the future but, through his spiritual work, actually transformed it. One way of understanding this is the Butterfly Effect in [[Edward Lorenz]]'s Chaos Theory. According to that theory, a butterfly flapping its wings in America could cause or prevent a tornado in Indonesia. This of course illustrates the improbability of predicting any event in a highly complex system due to the difficulty of knowing all variables. But, what if someone were enlightened to the point of omnipotence? What if someone did know all the variables? Such a person could not only predict the future, but with the rippling effect of seemingly small actions could actually change the future.

About the method he used in the work of renewal, Sangjenim said:

{{quote|There are opportunities for human action ... There is a program for each heavenly principle. The work of renewal is based on creating the opportunity and establishing the program. If I were to abandon this method and perform the work forcibly, it would bring disaster upon the world and kill multitudes. That is not My intention.
: - Dojeon 2:55:7-8}}

===Cosmic year===
[[File:Jeung San Do Cosmic Year en.png|thumb|The "cosmic year" of Jeung San Do.]]
According to Jeun Sang Do, [[Gang Il-sun]] revealed to humanity that the universe embodies a four-fold cycle. A "cosmic year" contains four cosmic seasons corresponding to birth, growth, harvest, and rest.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on Korean history==
According to Jeung San Do, the [[History of Korea]] is that of a [[chessboard]] used by America, China, Russia, and Japan. While the [[Empire of Japan]] completed the [[Japanese annexation of Korea|annexation of Korea]] in 1910, they were merely pawns or workmen (''ilkkun'') of Sangjenim; racial brothers who saved Korea from domination by the Western [[great power]]s. The Japanese, according to this narrative, provided the "service" (''pongsa'') of modernizing Korea as penance for the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)]]. Accordingly, [[Korean independence movement|resistance against Japan]] was ill-advised, and [[Chinilpa]] collaborationist organizations such as [[Iljinhoe]] should not be condemned. Koreans merely had to "wait patiently", as Jeung San Do taught, for the guests to vacate the board in order to assume ownership of the [[Korean Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Parliament of Histories: New Religions, Collective Historiography, and the Nation|first=Boudewijn|last=Walraven|journal=Korean Studies|volume=25|number=2|year=2002|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|pages=160–163|doi=10.1353/ks.2001.0024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders''', known as the '''Kerner Commission''' after its chair, [[Governor of Illinois|Governor]] [[Otto Kerner, Jr.]] of [[Illinois]], was an 11-member [[Presidential Commission (United States)|Presidential Commission]] established by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in {{Executive Order|11365}} to investigate the causes of the [[1967 Detroit riot|1967 race riots]] in the [[United States]] and to provide recommendations for the future.&lt;ref name=Johnson1967Remarks /&gt;

== Background ==

President Johnson appointed the commission on July 28, 1967, while rioting was still underway in Detroit, Michigan. Mounting civil unrest since 1965 had spawned riots in the black and Latino neighborhoods of major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles ([[Watts riots]] of 1965), Chicago ([[Division Street Riots]] of 1966 [the first Puerto Rican riot in US History]), and Newark ([[1967 Newark riots]]).&lt;ref name=africanaonline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanaonline.com/reports_kerner.htm |author=Toonari |title=Kerner Report |website=Africana Online |access-date=23 November 2009 |archive-date= 7 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107022536/http://www.africanaonline.com/reports_kerner.htm |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his remarks upon signing the order establishing the Commission, Johnson asked for answers to three basic questions about the riots: "What happened? Why did it happen? What can be done to prevent it from happening again and again?"&lt;ref name=Johnson1967Remarks&gt;{{cite web |first=Lyndon B.  |last=Johnson |author-link=Lyndon B. Johnson |title=Remarks Upon Signing Order Establishing the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders |date=July 29, 1967 |editor1-first=John T. |editor1-last=Woolley |editor2-first=Gerhard |editor2-last=Peters |website=The American Presidency Project |location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=University of California |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=28369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Report Summary ==

The Commission's final report, the '''Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eisenhowerfoundation.org/docs/kerner.pdf |title=Summary of Report |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Kerner Report''', was released on February 29, 1968, after seven months of investigation. The report became an instant bestseller, and over two million Americans bought copies of the 426-page document. Its finding was that the riots resulted from black frustration at the lack of economic opportunity. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] pronounced the report a "physician's warning of approaching death, with a prescription for life."&lt;ref name=africanaonline/&gt;

The report berated federal and state governments for failed housing, education and social-service policies. The report also aimed some of its sharpest criticism at the mainstream media. "The press has too long basked in a white world looking out of it, if at all, with white men's eyes and white perspective."

The report's most famous passage warned, "Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal."

Its results suggested that one main cause of urban violence was [[White people|white]] [[racism]] and suggested that white America bore much of the responsibility for black rioting and rebellion. It called to create new jobs, construct new housing, and put a stop to de facto [[Racial segregation|segregation]] in order to wipe out the destructive [[ghetto]] environment. In order to do so, the report recommended for government programs to provide needed services, to hire more diverse and sensitive police forces and, most notably, to invest billions in housing programs aimed at breaking up residential segregation.

Among other points, the Commission's suggestions included:

* "Unless there are sharp changes in the factors influencing Negro settlement patterns within metropolitan areas, there is little doubt that the trend toward Negro majorities will continue."
* "Providing employment for the swelling Negro ghetto population will require ...opening suburban residential areas to Negroes and encouraging them to move closer to industrial centers..."
* "...cities will have Negro majorities by 1985 and the suburbs ringing them will remain largely all white unless there are major changes in Negro fertility rates, in migration settlement patterns or public policy."
* "...we believe that the emphasis of the program should be changed from traditional publicly built slum based high rise projects to smaller units on scattered sites."

The [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] released federal funding for local police forces in response. Appointed by Johnson to serve as the commission's executive director, David Ginsburg played a pivotal role in writing the commission's findings.

== Aftermath ==

President Johnson, who had already pushed through the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]], ignored the report and rejected the Kerner Commission's recommendations.&lt;ref name=Risen09&gt;{{cite book|last=Risen|first=Clay|title=A nation on fire : America in the wake of the King assassination|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0-470-17710-5|chapter=King, Johnson, and The Terrible, Glorious Thirty-First Day of March}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1968, one month after the release of the Kerner report, [[King assassination riots|rioting]] broke out in more than 100 cities following the assassination of civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Our Nation Is Moving Toward Two Societies, One Black, One White—Separate and Unequal': Excerpts from the Kerner Report |website=History Matters: The U.S. Survey Course on the Web |publisher=George Mason University |url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6545/ }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

To mark the 30th anniversary of the Kerner Report, the [[Eisenhower Foundation]] sponsored two complementary reports, [[The Millennium Breach]] and [[Locked in the Poorhouse]]. The Millennium Breach, co-authored by former Senator and Commission member [[Fred R. Harris]], found the racial divide had grown in the subsequent years with [[inner city]] unemployment at crisis levels.&lt;ref name=Harris1998&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Harris |editor1-first=Fred R. |editor2-first=Lynn A. |editor2-last=Curtis |title=Locked in the Poorhouse: Crisis, Race, and Poverty in the United States |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc. |date=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Millennium Breach found that most of the decade that followed the Kerner Report, America made progress on the principal fronts the report dealt with: race, poverty, and inner cities. Then progress stopped and in some ways reversed by a series of economic shocks and trends and the government's action and inaction.

Harris reported, "Today, thirty years after the Kerner Report, there is more poverty in America, it is deeper, blacker and browner than before, and it is more concentrated in the cities, which have become America's poorhouses."&lt;ref name=Harris1998/&gt;

== Criticism ==
At a 1998 lecture commemorating the 30th anniversary of the report, [[Stephan Thernstrom]], a history professor at [[Harvard University]], stated: "Because the commission took for granted that the riots were the fault of white racism, it would have been awkward to have had to confront the question of why liberal Detroit blew up while Birmingham and other Southern cities — where conditions for blacks were infinitely worse — did not. Likewise, if the problem was white racism, why didn't the riots occur in the 1930s, when prevailing white racial attitudes were far more barbaric than they were in the 1960s?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Manly |date=February 28, 2008 |title=An unfilled prescription for racial equality |newspaper=Bay State Banner |location=Boston |department=Black History |volume=43 |issue=29 |url=http://www.baystate-banner.com/issues/2008/02/28/news/blackhistory02280890.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://nmaahc.si.edu/blog-post/kerner-commission&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''kishka''' is a type of [[prison]] cell used in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] prisons.  The cell was named after the gut ({{lang-ru|[[wikt:кишка|кишка]]}}, ''[[Intestine|kíshka]]''), in that it was tall and narrow, like an [[intestine]], but more like a chimney.  The prisoner had room to stand, but could not sit or kneel, let alone lie down.  In some Soviet prisons there was no drainage and the prisoner was forced to excrete standing up and to stand in his own urine and feces.  In some cases the cells were never cleaned. Prisoners could be held in these cells for days at a time.

{{quote|[[Sławomir Rawicz|Rawicz]] was transferred to an immense fortress prison in [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]], Ukraine, where he became the personal project of a huge, muscular – and inventively sadistic – NKVD major known as "The Bull." "He ran his interrogation sessions like an eminent surgeon, always showing off his skill before a changing crowd of junior officers," reflected Rawicz. "His methods were despicably ingenious."

One of'' The Bull's ''preferred methods of breaking his subjects' will was to insert them in a kishka. No provision was made for the inmates' bodily functions and the kishkas were never cleaned. Each day, Rawicz would be hauled out of his tiny cell, hosed off, and sent to The Bull for interrogation and torture.&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom Trek'' Grigg, William Norman

== Correctional supervision rates by state ==

Chart below has numbers for people in adult facilities, and for people on probation and on parole.&lt;ref name=cpusa2016/&gt; The incarceration numbers in the main part of the chart below are for sentenced and unsentenced inmates in adult facilities in local jails and state prisons, but not for people in federal prisons. 

The bottom of the chart has totals and average rates for each column. 

Federal prison numbers are added at the end of the chart. So the total number (local, state, and federal) under adult correctional supervision is 6,582,100. That is a correctional supervision rate of 2,630 per 100,000 U.S. adult residents. That rounds off to 2.6% of US adult residents.

Prince Carl of Denmark discontinued use of his Danish titles upon accepting the Norwegian throne, becoming [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]].

[[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark]] gave up the use of his Greek and Danish titles before marrying [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]], heiress to the British throne.

The Greek royal family continues to use the title "Prince(ss) of Greece and Denmark", but none of them have any [[Succession to the Danish throne|succession rights]] in Denmark since 1953.

A '''macuahuitl''' ({{IPA-nah|maːˈkʷawit͡ɬ|}}) is a wooden club with [[obsidian]] blades. The name is derived from the [[Nahuatl language]] and means "hand-wood".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/macuahuitl-sword-aztec-weapons-171566|title=The Fearsome Close-Quarter Combat Weapon of the Aztecs|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=27 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528134805/https://www.thoughtco.com/macuahuitl-sword-aztec-weapons-171566|archive-date=28 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sides are embedded with [[prismatic blade]]s traditionally [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|made from obsidian]]; obsidian is capable of producing an edge sharper than high quality steel razor blades. The macuahuitl was a standard close combat weapon.

Use of the maquahuitl as a weapon is attested from the first millennium CE. By the time of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest]] the macuahuitl was widely distributed in [[Mesoamerica]]. The weapon was used by different civilisations including the [[Aztec]] (Mexicas), [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], [[Mixtec]] and [[Toltec]].

One example of this weapon survived the [[Conquest of Mexico]]; it was part of the [[Royal Armoury of Madrid]] until it was destroyed by a fire in 1884. Images of the original designs survive in diverse catalogues. The oldest replica is the macuahuitl created by the medievalist [[Achille Jubinal]] in the 19th century.

Other military equipment recorded includes the [[chīmalli|round shield]] ({{wikt-lang|nci|chīmalli}}, {{IPA-nah|t͡ʃiˈmalːi|}}), the [[bow and arrow|bow]] ({{lang|nci|tlahuītōlli}}, {{IPA-nah|t͡ɬaʔwiːˈtoːlːi|}}), and the [[spear-thrower]] ({{wikt-lang|nci|ahtlatl}}, {{IPA-nah|ˈaʔt͡ɬat͡ɬ|}}).&lt;ref&gt;Soustelle (1961), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Its sides are embedded with [[prismatic blade]]s traditionally [[obsidian use in Mesoamerica|made from obsidian]]; obsidian is capable of producing an edge sharper than high-quality steel razor blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buck |first=BA |date=March 1982 |title=Ancient Technology in Contemporary Surgery |journal=The Western Journal of Medicine |volume=136 |issue=3 |pages=265–269 |pmc=1273673 |pmid=7046256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was capable of inflicting serious lacerations from the rows of [[obsidian]] blades embedded in its sides. These could be [[knapping|knapped]] into blades or spikes, or into a circular design that looked like scales.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1962), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; The maquahuitl is not a sword or a club, although it approximates a European broadsword.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Florentine Codex IX Aztec Warriors.jpg|thumb|Aztec warriors as shown in the 16th-century ''[[Florentine Codex]]'' (Vol. IX). Each warrior is brandishing a macuahuitl.]]

According to conquistador {{lang|es|[[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]|italic=no}}, the macuahuitl was 0.91 to 1.22 m long, and 75 mm wide, with a groove along either edge, into which sharp-edged pieces of flint or obsidian were inserted and firmly fixed with an adhesive.&lt;ref&gt;From [[Alfred Maudslay|A. P. Maudslay]]'s translation commentary of {{lang|es|[[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]|italic=no}}'s {{lang|es|Verdadera Historia de la Conquista de Nueva España|italic=yes}} (republished as ''The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico'', p. 465).&lt;/ref&gt; The rows of obsidian blades were sometimes discontinuous, leaving gaps along the side, while at other times the rows were set close together and formed a single edge.&lt;ref name="Hass85"&gt;Hassig, 1988, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted by the Spanish that the macuahuitl was so cleverly constructed that the blades could be neither pulled out nor broken. The macuahuitl was made with either a one-handed or two-handed grip, as well as in rectangular, ovoid, or pointed forms. Two-handed macuahuitl have been described as being "as tall as a man".&lt;ref name="Hass83"&gt;Hassig, 1988 p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typology ==
According to [[National School of Anthropology and History]] (ENAH) archaeologist [[Marco Cervera Obregón]], there were two versions of this weapon: The macuahuitl, about {{convert|70|to|80|cm|in}} long with six to eight blades on each side; and the mācuāhuitzōctli, a smaller club about {{convert|50|cm|in}} long with only four obsidian blades.&lt;ref&gt;Cervera Obregón 2006A, p.&amp;nbsp;128&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specimens ==
According to [[Ross Hassig]], the last authentic macuahuitl was destroyed in 1884 in a fire in the [[Royal Armoury of Madrid|Real Armería]] in Madrid, where it was housed beside the last [[tepoztopilli]].&lt;ref name="Hass83"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hassig 1992, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marco Cervera Obregón, there is supposed to be at least one macuahuitl in a [[Museo Nacional de Antropología]] warehouse,&lt;ref&gt;Cervera Obregón 2006A, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; but it is possibly lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cerevera Obregón |first=Marco |title=El macuahuitl, arqueologia experimental |url=http://arqueomilitar.blogspot.com/2009/02/el-macuahuitl-arqueologia-experimental.html |accessdate=26 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708023803/http://arqueomilitar.blogspot.com/2009/02/el-macuahuitl-arqueologia-experimental.html |archive-date=8 July 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all |date=19 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No actual maquahuitl specimens remain and the present knowledge of them comes from contemporaneous accounts and illustrations that date to the 16th century and earlier.&lt;ref name="Hass85"/&gt;

== Origins and distribution ==
[[File:Lienzo de Tlaxcala Iximche.gif|thumb|''[[History of Tlaxcala|Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]'' depiction of a battle during the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]]. Both [[Conquistador|Spanish]]-led [[Indian auxiliaries]] (left) as well as [[Maya peoples|Maya]] (right) wield macuahuitls.]]

The maquahuitl predates the Aztecs. Tools made from obsidian fragments were used by some of the earliest Mesoamericans. Obsidian used in ceramic vessels has been found at Aztec sites. Obsidian cutting knives, sickles, scrapers, drills, razors, and arrow points have also been found.&lt;ref name="Smit86"&gt;Smith, 1996, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Several obsidian mines were close to the Aztec civilisations in the [[Valley of Mexico]] as well as in the mountains north of the valley.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1996, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Among these were the [[Sierra de las Navajas]] (Razor Mountains), named after their obsidian deposits. Use of the maquahuitl as a weapon is attested from the 1st millenia{{nbs}}CE. A Mayan carving at [[Chichen Itza]] shows a warrior holding a macuahuitl, depicted as a club having separate blades sticking out from each side. In a mural, a warrior holds a club with many blades on one side and one sharp point on the other, also a possible variant of the macuahuitl.&lt;ref name="Hass85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obregón"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cervera Obregón |first=Marco |year=2006 |title=The macuahuitl: an innovative weapon of the Late Post-Classic in Mesoamerica |url=http://www.woosterglobalhistory.org/LAcolonial/archive/files/23395812_33c717a7fb.pdf |journal=Arms &amp; Armour |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=137–138 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320100504/http://www.woosterglobalhistory.org/LAcolonial/archive/files/23395812_33c717a7fb.pdf |archive-date=20 March 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest]] the macuahuitl was widely distributed in [[Mesoamerica]], with records of its use by the Aztecs, Mixtecs, Tarascans, Toltecs and others.&lt;ref&gt;Obregón, 2006A, pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; It was also commonly used by the [[Indian auxiliaries]] of Spain,{{sfnp|Asselbergs|2014|pp=76, 78}} though they favored Spanish swords. As Mesoamericans in Spanish service needed a special permission to carry European arms, metal swords brought Indian auxiliaries more prestige than maquahuitls in the eyes of Europeans as well as natives.{{sfnp|Asselbergs|2014|p=79}}

== Effectiveness ==
The macuahuitl was sharp enough to decapitate a man.&lt;ref name="Smit86"/&gt; According to an account by [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], one of [[Hernán Cortés]]’s [[conquistador]]s, it could even decapitate a horse:

{{quote|[[Pedro de Morón]] was a very good horseman, and as he charged with three other horsemen into the ranks of the enemy the Indians seized hold of his lance and he was not able to drag it away, and others gave him cuts with their broadswords, and wounded him badly, and then they slashed at the mare, and cut her head off at the neck so that it hung by the skin, and she fell dead.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz del Castillo, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another account by a companion of Cortés known as ''[[Narrative of Some Things of New Spain and of the Great City of Temestitan|The Anonymous Conqueror]]'' tells a similar story of its effectiveness:
{{quote|They have swords of this kind – of wood made like a two-handed sword, but with the hilt not so long; about three fingers in breadth. The edges are grooved, and in the grooves they insert stone knives, that cut like a [[Toledo steel|Toledo]] blade. I saw one day an Indian fighting with a mounted man, and the Indian gave the horse of his antagonist such a blow in the breast that he opened it to the entrails, and it fell dead on the spot. And the same day I saw another Indian give another horse a blow in the neck, that stretched it dead at his feet.|"Offensive and Defensive Arms", page 23&lt;ref name="anon"&gt;The Anonymous Conqueror. (1917). [http://www.famsi.org/research/christensen/anon_con/section05.htm ''Narrative of Some Things of New Spain and of the Great City of Temestitán The Cortés Society:''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306183615/http://www.famsi.org/research/christensen/anon_con/section05.htm |date=6 March 2015 }} Chapter 4. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another account by [[Francisco de Aguilar (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguilar]] reads:

{{quote|They used ... cudgels and swords and a great many bows and arrows ... One Indian at a single stroke cut open the whole neck of [[Cristóbal de Olid]]’s horse, killing the horse. The Indian on the other side slashed at the second horseman and the blow cut through the horse’s [[pastern]], whereupon this horse also fell dead. As soon as this sentry gave the alarm, they all ran out with their weapons to cut us off, following us with great fury, shooting arrows, spears and stones, and wounding us with their swords. Here many Spaniards fell, some dead and some wounded, and others without any injury who fainted away from fright.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco de Auguilar, untitled account, in The Conquistadors, 139–140, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Aztec Warriors (Florentine Codex).jpg|thumb|This drawing, from the 16th-century [[Florentine Codex]], shows Aztec warriors brandishing macuahuitls]]

Given the importance of [[human sacrifice]] in Nahua cultures, their warfare styles, particularly those of the Aztec and Maya, placed a premium on the capture of enemy warriors for live sacrifice. Advancement into the elite ''cuāuhocēlōtl'' warrior societies of the Aztec, for example, required taking 20 live captives from the battlefield. The macuahuitl thus shows several features designed to make it a useful tool for capturing prisoners: fitting spaced instead of contiguous blades, as seen in many codex illustrations, would intentionally limit the wound depth from a single blow, and the heavy wooden construction allows weakened opponents to be easily [[club (weapon)|clubbed]] unconscious with the flat side of the weapon. The art of disabling opponents using an un-bladed macuahuitl as a sparring club was taught from a young age in the Aztec [[Tēlpochcalli]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;Berdan and Anawalt, ''The Essential Codex Mendoza'', v. 2–4. UCal Press; 1997. Folio 62-R, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The macuahuitl had many drawbacks in combat versus European steel swords. Despite being objectively sharper, prismatic obsidian is also considerably more [[brittle]] than steel; obsidian blades of the type used on the macuahuitl tended to shatter on impact with other obsidian blades, steel swords or [[plate armour]]. Obsidian blades also have difficulty penetrating European [[mail (armour)|mail]]. The thin, replaceable blades used on the macuahuitl were easily dulled or chipped by repeated impacts on bone or wood, making artful use of the weapon critical. It takes more time to lift and swing a club than it does to thrust with a sword. More space is needed as well, so warriors advanced in loose formations and fought in single combat.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, 2000, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental archaeology ==
Replicas of the macuahuitl have been produced and tested against sides of beef for documentary shows on the History and Discovery channels, to demonstrate the effectiveness of this weapon. On the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] show ''[[Warriors (2009 TV series)|Warriors]]'', special forces operator and martial artist [[Terry Schappert]] injured himself while fencing with a macuahuitl; he cut the back of his left leg as the result of a back-swing motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title="Warriors" Mayan Armageddon (TV Episode 2009) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1407019/plotsummary |accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[SpikeTV]]'s reality program ''[[Deadliest Warrior]]'' a replica was created and tested against a model of a horse's head created using a horse's skeleton and [[ballistics gel]]. Actor and martial artist [[Éder Saúl López]] was able to decapitate the model, but it took three swings. Blows from the replica macuahuitl were most effective when it was swung and then dragged backwards upon impact, creating a sawing motion. This led [[Max Geiger]], the [[computer programmer]] of the series, to refer to the weapon as "the obsidian chainsaw". This may have been due to the crudely made obsidian cutting edges of the weapon used in the show, compared with more finely made prismatic obsidian blades, as in the Madrid specimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Gonsalves |first=Kiran |title=Aztec Jaguar vs. Zande Warrior |date=11 May 2010 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1643034/ |last2=Ojeda |first2=Michael S. |others=Cody Jones, Jay Charlot, Darell M.

'''Medical model''' is the term coined by [[psychiatrist]] [[R. D. Laing]] in his ''The Politics of the Family and Other Essays'' (1971), for the "set of procedures in which all doctors are trained".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laing|first=Ronald|title=The Politics of the Family and Other Essays|year=1971|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes complaint, history, physical examination, ancillary tests if needed, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis with and without treatment.

The medical model has proven highly successful and even indispensable in many contexts; it is difficult to name a plausible alternative to medical diagnosis and treatment for a depressed [[skull fracture]].

The medical model embodies basic assumptions about medicine that drive research and theorizing about physical or psychological difficulties on a basis of causation and remediation.

It can be contrasted with other models that make different basic assumptions. Examples include [[holistic health|holistic model]] of the [[alternative medicine|alternative health]] movement and the [[social model of disability|social model]] of the [[disability rights movement]], as well as to [[biopsychosocial]] and [[recovery model]]s of mental disorders. For example, [[Gregory Bateson]]'s [[double bind]] theory of [[schizophrenia]] focuses on environmental rather than medical causes. These models are not mutually exclusive. A model is not a statement of absolute reality or a belief system but a tool for helping patients. Thus, utility is the main criterion, and the utility of a model depends on context.&lt;ref&gt;http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jsyt.22.2.60.23350?journalCode=jsyt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
===In psychology===
In psychology, the term "Medical Model" refers to the assumption that [[psychopathology]] is the result of one's biology, that is to say, a physical/organic problem in brain structures, neurotransmitters, genetics, the endocrine system etc., as with traumatic [[brain injury]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], or [[Down syndrome|Down's syndrome]]. The medical model is useful in these situations as a guide for diagnosis, prognosis, and research. However, for most mental disorders, exclusive reliance on the medical model leads to an incomplete understanding, and, frequently, to incomplete or ineffective treatment interventions. The current [[DSM-5|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-5), addresses this point in part, stating, "However, in the absence of clear biological markers or clinically useful measurements of severity for many mental disorders, it has not been possible to completely separate normal and pathological symptom expressions contained in diagnostic criteria. This gap in information is particularly problematic in clinical situations in which the patient's symptom presentation by itself (particularly in mild forms) is not inherently pathological and may be encountered in individuals for whom a diagnosis of 'mental disorder' would be inappropriate." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|last=|first=|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|isbn=978-0-89042-554-1|edition=5th|location=Arlington, VA|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Germ theory of disease===
The rise of modern scientific medicine during the 19th century has a great impact on the development of the medical model. Especially important was the development of the "germ theory" of disease by European medical researchers such as [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Robert Koch]]. During the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, the physical causes of a variety of diseases were uncovered, which, in turn, led to the development of effective forms of treatment.

==Concept of "disease" and "injury"==
The concepts of "disease" and "injury" are central to the medical model. In general, "disease" or "injury" refer to some deviation from normal body functioning that has undesirable consequences for the affected individual. An important aspect of the medical model is that it regards signs (objective indicators such as an elevated temperature) and symptoms (subjective feelings of distress expressed by the patient) as indicative of an underlying physical abnormality (pathology) within the individual. According to the medical model, medical treatment, wherever possible, should be directed at the underlying pathology in an attempt to correct the abnormality and cure the disease. In regard to many mental illnesses, for example, the assumption is that the cause of the disorder lies in abnormalities within the affected individual’s brain (specially their brain neurochemistry). That carries the implicit conclusion that disordered behaviors are not learned but are spontaneously generated by the disordered brain. According to the medical model, for treatment (such as drugs), to be effective, it should be directed as closely as possible at correcting the theorized chemical imbalance in the mentally ill person’s brain.

===Importance of diagnosis===
Proper diagnosis (that is, the categorization of illness signs and symptoms into meaning disease groupings) is essential to the medical model. Placing the patient's signs and symptoms into the correct diagnostic category can:

# Provide the physician with clinically useful information about the course of the illness over time (its prognosis);
# Point to (or at least suggest) a specific underlying cause or causes for the disorder; and
# Direct the physician to specific treatment or treatments for the condition.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

For example, if a patient presents to a [[primary care]] provider with symptoms of a given illness, by taking a thorough history, performing assessments (such as [[auscultation]] and [[palpation]]), and, in some cases, ordering diagnostic tests the primary care provider can make a reasonable conclusion about the cause of the symptoms. Based on clinical experience and [[evidence-based medicine|available evidence]], the health care professional can identify treatment options that are likely to be successful.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Other important aspects==
Finally, adherence to the medical model has a number of other consequences for the patient and society as a whole, both positive and negative:

# In the medical model, the physician was traditionally seen as the expert, and patients were expected to comply with the advice. The physician assumes an authoritarian position in relation to the patient. Because of the specific expertise of the physician, according to the medical model, it is necessary and to be expected. However, in recent years, the move towards [[patient-centered care]] has resulted in greater patient involvement in many cases.
# In the medical model, the physician may be viewed as the dominant health care professional, who is the professional trained in diagnosis and treatment.
# An ill patient should not be held responsible for the condition. The patient should not be blamed or stigmatized for the illness.
# Under the medical model, the disease condition of the patient is of major importance. Social, psychological, and other "external" factors, which may influence patient behavior, may be given less attention.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The '''Lao Nyaw''', '''Thai Nyaw''' or '''Tai Yo''' (Thai/Isan: [[wikt:ไทญ้อ|ไทญ้อ]], {{IPA-th|tʰāj jɔ́ː}}, &lt;small&gt;Isan pronunciation:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-th|tʰɑj ɲɔː|}}) are an [[ethnic group]] of [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]], scattered throughout the provinces of [[Isan]] such as [[Nong Khai]], [[Sakon Nakhon]], [[Nakhon Phanom]], and parts of [[Bolikhamxai]] and [[Khammouan]] provinces of [[Laos]]. They are also referred to as simply ''Nyaw'' or ''Yaw'', depending on either the Lao, Isan, and Nyaw pronunciation, which all pronounce the initial consonant as {{IPAblink|ɲ}}, or the Thai pronunciation, which pronounces the initial consonant as {{IPAblink|j}}.

==History==
The Tai Nyaw believe that they are descendants of people originally from the northernmost part of Laos and Tonkin or immigrants during Tai migrations.  Whatever the case may be, their dialect most closely resembles the Lao dialects from the regions east of [[Luang Prabang]]. Legend has it descendants are from the old king of [[Laos]], who migrated after the overthrow and was forced to leave and spread out to neighboring countries for refuge. The Nyaw believed their ancestors are the king's personal guards and extended family.

==Language==
{{main|Nyaw language}}
The Nyaw language is very similar to the [[Lao language]], which is referred to as the [[Isan language]] in Thailand. It is most similar to the [[Phuthai]] language also spoken within the same regions. Most Nyaw are often also fluent in [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]].

==Religion==
The Tai Nyaw practise [[Theravada Buddhism]], but have also maintained their original animist religion.  Important to the Nyaw people is the tutelary spirit of the village, known in the dialect as ผู้เจ้า {{IPA-th|pʰuː tɕaw|}}.

==Status==

In Thailand this language group is increasingly becoming integrated into the mainstream Isan language. This is due in large part to a campaign by the Thai government to modernize all Thai people, as well as due to outside influences of television, internet and local radio broadcasts. Most younger members of this northeastern tribal group in Thailand prefer to be called Thai rather than by their traditional tribal group name.

==Headhunters==

Believed to be Nyaw indigenous headhunters who sought other tribes for bounty and sport, It was an honor to retrieve the heads of rival tribes as a trophy. Many traditional families still kept the severed skulls as charms and for use in [[Black Magic]] known as "Kong Dee". After the integration of [[Laos|Lao]], [[Thailand|Thai]] and [[Cambodia]]n mainstream society the head hunts were deemed unacceptable.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4633">"Gender" refers to social or cultural distinctions associated with being male or female. Scholars generally regard gender as a [[social construct]]—meaning that it does not exist naturally, but is instead a concept that is created by cultural and societal norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = Source: Boundless. “Defining Sex, Gender, and Sexuality.” Boundless Psychology. Boundless, 20 Aug. 2015. Retrieved 23 Oct. 2015 from https://www.boundless.com/psychology/textbooks/boundless-psychology-textbook/gender-and-sexuality-15/introduction-to-gender-and-sexuality-75/defining-sex-gender-and-sexuality-294-12829/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Gender binary]]'' is the system of viewing gender as consisting solely of two, opposite categories, termed “male and female”, in which no other possibilities for gender or anatomy are believed to exist. This system is oppressive to anyone who defies their sex assigned at birth, but particularly those who are gender-variant or do not fit neatly into one of the two standard categories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gender identity, one’s internal sense of being male, female, neither of these, both, or other genders, is something that everyone has, and not everyone identifies their gender as male or female.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is important to note that sex, gender, and sexuality are not the same, and that one does not dictate the other. "Sex" is what you are assigned at birth, and is typically based on physical anatomy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "Sexuality", or sexual orientation, is a person's enduring physical, romantic, emotional, and other form of attraction to others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Other genders ==
There are many different ways to describe one’s gender. ''[[Trans Student Educational Resources]]'' (TSER)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = LGBTQ+ Definitions {{!}} Trans Student Educational Resources|url = http://www.transstudent.org/definitions|website = www.transstudent.org|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a breakdown of gender with defining the following terms;

[[Bigender|Bigender:]] Refers to those who identify as two genders.

[[Cisgender]]/cis: Someone who exclusively identifies as their sex assigned at birth.

[[Genderqueer]]/non-binary: An identity commonly used by people who do not identify within the gender binary. Those who identify as genderqueer may identify as neither male nor female, may see themselves as outside of or in between the binary gender boxes, or may simply feel restricted by gender labels.

[[Intersex]]: Describing a person with a less common combination of hormones, socio-emotional, chromosomes, and anatomy that are used to assign sex at birth. This term is not interchangeable with or a synonym for transgender, although some intersex people do identify as transgender.

[[Queer]]: A term for people of marginalized gender identities and sexual orientations who are not cisgender or heterosexual.

[[Transgender]]/trans: Term for those who do not identify or exclusively identify with their sex assigned at birth.

[[Transsexual]]: Term describing someone who undergoes or wants to undergo transition within the gender binary.

It is crucial to know what individuals choose to identify themselves as, and what pronouns they prefer others to use as well. Several terms, such as ''queer'', are used as slurs and may be offensive to some, while others may not mind it.

== Gender norms ==
Gender norms are the socially acceptable ways of acting out gender, and are learned from birth. People learn what is expected of their gender from what their parents teach them, as well as what they pick up at school, through religious or cultural teachings, in the media, and various other social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sociology of Gender|url = http://othersociologist.com/sociology-of-gender/|website = The Other Sociologist - Analysis of Difference...

Many things in society are defined by gender—toys, colors, clothes and behaviors are just some of the more obvious examples. Through a combination of social conditioning and personal preference, by age three most children prefer activities and exhibit behaviors typically associated with their sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.genderspectrum.org/quick-links/understanding-gender/|title = Gender Spectrum|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Picard''' is a [[langues d'oïl]] dialect spoken in the northernmost part of France and southern Belgium. Administratively, the area where it is spoken is divided between the French [[Hauts-de-France]] region and the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Wallonia]] along the border between the two countries – its traditional core being the districts of [[Tournai]] and [[Mons]], commonly referred to as [[Wallonie Picarde|Walloon Picardy]].

The Picard language group is known by several different names. Residents of [[Picardy]] simply call it '''''picard''''', but it is more commonly known as '''''chti''''' or '''''chtimi''''' in the more populated [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] ([[Romance Flanders]] around the metropolis of [[Lille]] and [[Douai]], and northeast [[Artois]] around [[Béthune]] and [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]]). It is also named '''''rouchi''''' around [[Valenciennes]]; or simply as '''[[patois]]''' by Northerners in general. [[linguistics|Linguist]]s group all of them under the name ''Picard''. In general, the variety spoken in Picardy is understood by speakers in Nord-Pas-de-Calais and vice versa.

Today, Picard is usually classified as merely a dialect of French as spoken in France by French linguists, rather than as a standalone language or distinct dialect in its own right, primarily due to French's heavy influence over the centuries when both French ([[Francien language|Francien dialect]]) and Picard were developing from a common [[protolanguage]], [[Vulgar Latin]]. It is also seen as such by many of its speakers.

==Recognition==
[[File:Langues_d'oïl_2.svg|thumb|240px|The geographical spread of Picard and Chtimi among the [[Langues d'oïl|Oïl languages]] (other than French) can be seen in shades of green and yellow on this map.]]
[[Belgium's French Community]] gave full official recognition to Picard as a regional language along with [[Walloon language|Walloon]], ''[[Lorrain language|Gaumais]]'' ([[Lorraine (région)|Lorraine]]), [[Champenois]] ([[Champagne, France|Champagne]]) and [[Lorraine Franconian|Lorraine German]] in its 1990 decree. The French government has not followed suit and has not recognized Picard as an official regional language (in line with its policy of linguistic unity, which allows for only one official language in France), but some reports have recognized Picard as a language distinct from French.

A 1999 report by Bernard Cerquiglini, the director of the ''{{lang|fr|Institut national de la langue française}}'' (National Institute of the French Language) stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The gap has continued to widen between French and the varieties of ''[[Oïl languages|langues d'oïl]]'', which today we would call "French dialects";  [[Frainc-Comtou dialect|Franc-comtois]], [[Walloon language|Walloon]], Picard, [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Gallo language|Gallo]], [[Poitevin (language)|Poitevin]], [[Saintongeais]], [[Burgundian language (Oïl)|Bourguignon-morvandiau]], [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] must be accepted among the regional [[languages of France]]; by placing them on the list [of French regional languages], they will be known from then on as ''langues d'oïl''.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Cerquiglini, ''[http://www.dglflf.culture.gouv.fr/lang-reg/rapport_cerquiglini/langues-france.html The Languages of France]'', Report to the Minister of National Education, Research and Technology, and the Minister of Culture and Communication, April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even if it has no official status as a language in France, Picard, along with all the other languages spoken in France, benefits from actions led by the Culture Minister's General Commission on the French Language and the Languages of France (''la Délégation générale à la langue française et aux langues de France'').

==Origins and dialectic variations==
[[File:Aire de répartition du picard.PNG|160px|thumb|spread of '''Picard''' (Picard, Chti, Rouchi, etc.)]]
Picard, like French, is one of the ''[[Oïl languages|langues d'oïl]]'' and belongs to the [[Gaul|Gallo]]-[[Romance languages|Roman]] family of languages. It consists of all the varieties used for writing ({{lang-la|scriptae}}) in the north of France from before 1000 (in the south of France at that time the [[Occitan language]] was used). Often, the ''langues d'oïl'' are referred to simply as [[Old French]].

Picard is phonetically quite different from the North-central ''langues d'oïl'', which evolved into modern French. Among the most notable traits, the evolution in Picard towards [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] is less marked than in the central ''langues d'oïl'' in which it is particularly striking; {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/ɡ/}} before {{IPA|/j/}}, tonic {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}, as well as in front of tonic {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} (the open {{IPA|/o/}} of the French ''p'''o'''rte'') in central Old French but not in Picard:

* Picard ''keval'' ~ Old French ''cheval'' (horse; pronounced {{IPA|['''tʃ'''eval]}} rather than the modern {{IPA|['''ʃ'''əval]}}), from ''*kabal'' ([[vulgar Latin]] ''caballus''): retaining the original {{IPA|/k/}} in Picard before tonic {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}.
* Picard ''gambe'' ~ Old French ''jambe'' (leg; pronounced {{IPA|['''dʒ'''ambe]}} rather than the modern {{IPA|['''ʒ'''ɑ̃b]}} – {{IPA|[ʒ]}} is the ''ge'' sound in bei'''ge'''), from ''*gambe'' (vulgar Latin ''gamba''): absence of palatalization of {{IPA|/ɡ/}} in Picard before tonic {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}.
* Picard ''kief'' ~ Old French ''chef'' (leader), from ''*kaf'' ([[Latin]] ''caput''): less palatalization of {{IPA|/k/}} in Picard
* Picard ''cherf'' ~ Old French ''cerf'' (stag; pronounced {{IPA|['''tʃ'''erf]}} and {{IPA|['''ts'''erf]}} respectively), from ''*kerf'' (Latin ''cervus''): simple palatalization in Picard, palatalization then fronting in Old French{{Citation needed|date=September 2010|reason=''cervus → *kárf → ʃerf'' seems implausible; more likely it is ''cervus → *serf → ʃerf''. Response: it's most likely to be cervus → tʃerf (cf. Italian cervo with tʃ) → ʃerf in Picard and cervus → tʃerf → tserf → serf in French}}

The effects of palatalization can be summarised as this:
* {{IPA|/k/}} and (tonic) {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/e/}}: Picard {{IPA|/tʃ/}} (written ''ch'') ~  Old French {{IPA|/ts/}} (written ''c'')
* {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} +  tonic {{IPA|/a/}} or {{IPA|/ɔ/}}: Picard {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} ~ Old French {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}}.

There are striking differences, such as Picard ''cachier'' ('to hunt') ~ Old French ''chacier'', which later took the modern French form of ''chasser''.

Because of the proximity of [[Paris]] to the northernmost regions of France, French (that is, the languages that were spoken in and around Paris) greatly influenced Picard and vice versa. The closeness between Picard and French made the former not always be recognised as a language in its own right, but rather a "distortion of French" as it is often viewed.

Picard includes a variety of very closely related dialects. It is difficult to list them all accurately in the absence of specific studies on the dialectical variations, but these varieties can probably ''provisionally'' be distinguished 
{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}: Amiénois, Vimeu-Ponthieu, Vermandois, Thiérache, Beauvaisis, "chtimi" (Bassin Minier, [[Lille]]), dialects in other regions near Lille (Roubaix, Tourcoing, Mouscron, Comines), "rouchi" ([[Valenciennes|Valenciennois]]) and Tournaisis, Borain, Artésien rural, Boulonnais.

The varieties are defined by specific phonetic, morphological and lexical traits and sometimes by a distinctive literary tradition.

==Vocabulary==
The majority of Picard words derive from [[Vulgar Latin]].

Picard is not taught in [[France|French]] schools (apart from a few one-off and isolated courses) and is generally only spoken among friends or family members. It has nevertheless been the object of scholarly research at universities in [[Lille]] and [[Amiens]], as well as at [[Indiana University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~frithome/faculty/frLing/auger.shtml Julie Auger], Department of French and Italian, Indiana University&lt;/ref&gt; Since people are now able to move around France more easily than in past centuries, the different varieties of Picard are converging and becoming more similar. In its daily use, Picard is tending to lose its distinctive features and may be confused with regional French. At the same time, even though most Northerners can understand Picard today, fewer and fewer are able to speak it, and people who speak Picard as their [[first language]] are increasingly rare, particularly under 50.&lt;ref&gt;William Orem, [http://www.indiana.edu/~rcapub/v23n1/p16.html "The Princess &amp; Picard"], ''Research &amp; Creative Activity'', April 2000 Volume XXIII Number 1, Indiana University&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 film ''[[Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis]]'', starring comedian [[Dany Boon]], deals with Ch'ti language and culture and the perceptions of the region by outsiders.

==Written Picard==
Today Picard is primarily a spoken language, but in the [[medieval]] period, there is a wealth of literary texts in Picard. However, Picard was not able to compete with French and was slowly reduced to the status of a regional language.

A more recent body of Picard literature, written during the last two centuries, also exists. Modern written Picard is generally a transcription of the spoken language. For that reason, words are often spelled in a variety of different ways (in the same way that English and French were before they were standardised).

One system of spelling for Picard words is very similar to that of French. It is undoubtedly the easiest for French speakers to understand but can also contribute the stereotype that Picard is only a corruption of French rather than a language in its own right.

Various spelling methods have been proposed since the 1960s to offset the disadvantage and to give Picard a visual identity that is distinct from French. There is now a consensus, at least between universities, in favor of the written form known as '''Feller-Carton''' (based on the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] spelling system, which was developed by [[Jules Feller]], and adapted for Picard by Professor [[Fernand Carton]]).

==Learning Picard==

Picard, although primarily a spoken language, has a body of written literature: poetry, songs ("[[P'tit Quinquin (song)|P'tit quinquin]]" for example), comic books, etc.

A number of dictionaries and ''patois'' guides also exist (for French speakers):

In [[great house]]s, '''scullery maids''' were the lowest-ranked and often the youngest of the female [[domestic worker|domestic servants]]&lt;ref name="Modern girl too 'soft' for 1900s life"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/modern-girl-too-soft-for-1900s-life-6302211.html|title=Modern girl too 'soft' for 1900s life|publisher=Evening Standard|language=English|author=Valentine Low|date=3 April 2002|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acted as assistant to a [[kitchen maid (domestic worker)|kitchen maid]].&lt;ref&gt;''Children Living in Victorian Britain'', p. 13 https://books.google.com/books?id=0nhQojD3dN8C&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The scullery maid reported (through the kitchen maid) to the [[cook (domestic worker)|cook]] or [[chef]]. Along with the junior kitchen-maid, the scullery maid did not eat at the communal servants' dining hall table, but in the kitchen in order to keep an eye on the food that was still cooking.&lt;ref&gt;''The Country House Kitchen: 1650-1900'', Pamela Sambrook and Peter Brears,1996, {{ISBN|0-7509-1642-7}}, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duties of the scullery maid included the most physical and demanding tasks in the [[kitchen]]&lt;ref name="Modern girl too 'soft' for 1900s life"/&gt; such as cleaning and scouring the floor, stoves, sinks, pots, and dishes. After scouring the plates in the [[scullery (room)|scullery]], she would leave them on racks to dry. The scullery maid also assisted in cleaning vegetables, plucking fowl, and scaling fish.&lt;ref&gt;''The Country House Kitchen'', p 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Book of Household Management''==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The duties of the scullery-maid are to assist the cook; to keep the scullery clean, and all the metallic as well as earthenware kitchen utensils.

The position of scullery-maid is not, of course, one of high rank, nor is the payment for her services large. But if she be fortunate enough to have over her a good kitchen-maid and clever cook, she may very soon learn to perform various little duties connected with cooking operations, which may be of considerable service in fitting her for a more responsible place. Now, it will be doubtless thought by the majority of our readers, that the fascinations connected with the position of the scullery-maid, are not so great as to induce many people to leave a comfortable home in order to work in a scullery.

—[[Mrs. Beeton]], ''[[The Book of Household Management]]'', published 1861&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]] |last= Beeton |first=Isabella |authorlink=Isabella Beeton |year=1861 |publisher= S. O. Beeton Publishing |location=London |chapter=Chapter 4 - Introduction to Cookery |chapterurl=http://www.mrsbeeton.com/04-chapter4.html |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Additional duties==
[[File:Dutch - Scullery Maid - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Scullery maids cleaned metallic and earthenware kitchen utensils, but not fine [[porcelain|china]], stemware, [[crystal]] or plate [[silver]].]]

The scullery maid provided hot water for the scullery, kitchen tasks, and household. In addition to her other tasks, the scullery maid had to keep the scullery clean by clearing away meat and vegetable garbage, scrubbing work tables, and swilling the floors. The water was carried through a drain outside the house.&lt;ref&gt;''The Country House Kitchen'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  Scullery maids would rarely have handled fine [[porcelain|china]], stemware, [[crystal]] or plate [[silver]];  these are cleaned by [[maid|housemaids]] and [[footman|footmen]].  Before the advent of central heating systems, scullery maids were required to light the fires on the kitchen stove and supply hot water for tea and washing. She performed these tasks in the morning before the cook came down to the kitchens.&lt;ref&gt;Edwardian Life: A Typical Day in the House https://www.pbs.org/manorhouse/edwardianlife/typical_day.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[household]] with no [[between maid]], the scullery maid may also have waited on staff in the [[Servants' hall]], although this may have been assigned to another maid or a junior footman.  In the days before the indoor [[water closet]] she may have been required to empty and clean the servants' [[chamber pot]]s as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theresestenzel.com/dinner.html Dinner is Served: The Role of English Servants]&lt;/ref&gt;

This work has, in modern (i.e. the nineteenth century) times, primarily been performed by women, but in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] households female domestics were relatively rare. A male servant performing the tasks described above would be called a '''scullion'''. In 1386, when the [[English Parliament]] requested the removal of certain of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]'s ministers, the king infamously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a scullion from his kitchen at parliament's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nigel|last=Saul|authorlink=Nigel Saul|title=Richard II|edition=|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|year=1997|isbn=0-300-07003-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The root of the word scullery is the 1300–50 French word "escuelerie" (pronounced ''squillerye'' &lt;  equivalent to ''escuele'' -dish (&lt; L scutella, dim. of scutra pan) + ''rie'' -ry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/scullery Scullery] reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Local factors include [[tectonic]] effects, and [[subsidence]] of the land, tides, currents and storms. Sea level rise is expected to continue for centuries.

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sustained global warming of more than 2&amp;nbsp;C°&lt;!-- DO NOT use {{convert}} for Celsius temperature changes. For example: 2 C° increase is a 2 degree change in temperature and not 2°C which is 35°F.

Societies can respond to sea level rise in three different ways: retreat, accommodate and protect. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand, but at other times choices have to be made between different strategies. Ecosystems that adapt to rising sea levels by moving inland might not always be able to do so, due to natural or man made barriers.

== Past changes in sea level ==
[[File:Post-Glacial Sea Level.png|thumb| Changes in sea level since the end of the [[Last glacial period|last glacial episode]]]]

{{See also|Past sea level|}}Understanding past sea level is important for the analysis of current and future changes. In the recent geological past changes in land ice and thermal expansion from increased temperatures are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time the Earth was 2&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;!-- DO NOT use {{convert}} for Celsius temperature changes. --&gt; warmer than the pre-industrial temperatures, sea levels were at least {{Convert|5|metres|}} higher than present. This was during the last [[interglacial]], when the earth warming was caused by slow changes in the [[Milankovitch cycles|orbital forcing]]. The warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years and the magnitude of the rise in sea level implied a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.&lt;ref name="ipcc13" /&gt;{{rp|1139}}

Since the [[Last Glacial Maximum|last glacial maximum]] about 20,000 years ago, the sea level has risen by more than {{Convert|125|m|}}, with rates varying from less than a mm/year to 40+ mm/year, as a result of melting ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia. Rapid disintegration of ice sheets led to so called '[[Meltwater pulse 1A|meltwater pulses]]', periods during which sea level rose rapidly. The rate of rise started to slow down 8.2 thousand years before present; the sea level was almost constant in the last 2,500 years, before the recent rising trend starting approximately in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lambeck|first=Kurt|last2=Rouby|first2=Hélène|last3=Purcell|first3=Anthony|last4=Sun|first4=Yiying|last5=Sambridge|first5=Malcolm|date=2014-10-28|title=Sea level and global ice volumes from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/43/15296|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=111|issue=43|pages=15296–15303|doi=10.1073/pnas.1411762111|issn=0027-8424|pmid=25313072|pmc=4217469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sea level measurement ==
To get precise measurements for sea level, researchers studying the state of frozen water and the ocean on our planet factor in ongoing [[geomorphology|deformations of the solid Earth]], in particular due to [[Glacial isostatic adjustment|landmasses still rising from past ice masses retreating]]. Additionally, [[Gravity of Earth|Earth gravitation]] and [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] have to be accounted for. These factors are dependent on the different layers which make up the Earth ([[lithosphere]], [[asthenosphere]]), and the order in which land-based ice melts. Because the involved processes, which are collectively known as the ''Sea-level equation'', change very slowly, on time scales of thousands of years, they are considered to be constant.&lt;ref name="WCRP2018"/&gt;

===Satellites===
[[Image:TOPEX-JasonSeries2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jason-1]] continued the sea surface measurements started by TOPEX/Poseidon. It was followed by the [[Ocean Surface Topography Mission]] on [[Jason-2]], and by [[Jason-3]]]]

[[File:NOAA sea level trend 1993 2010.png|thumb|right|Sea level trends from [[satellite altimetry]] (1993–2012)]]
Since the 1992 launch of [[TOPEX/Poseidon]], altimetric satellites have been recording the change in sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/topex/ | title = Ocean Surface Topography from Space | publisher = NASA/JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those satellites can measure the hills and valleys in the sea caused by currents and detect trends in their height. To measure the distance to the sea surface, the satellite sends a microwave pulse to the ocean's surface and records the time it takes to return. A [[microwave radiometer]] corrects any delay that may be caused by [[water vapor]] in the [[atmosphere]]. Combining this data with the precise location of the spacecraft makes it possible to determine sea-surface height to within a few centimeters (about one inch).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/jason-3/mission.html|title=Jason-3 Satellite - Mission|website=www.nesdis.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current rates of sea level rise from [[satellite altimetry]] have been estimated to be {{convert|3.0|±|0.4|mm}} per year for the period 1993–2017.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nerem|first=R.

A small calibration error for the Topex/Poseidon satellite discovered in 2015 was identified as the cause of this mismatch. It had caused a slight overestimation of the 1992–2005 sea levels, which masked the ongoing sea level rise acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27497-apparent-slowing-of-sea-level-rise-is-artefact-of-satellite-data.html#.VVE7uPmqpBc|title=Apparent slowing of sea level rise is artefact of satellite data|date=11 May 2015|author=Michael Le Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With satellites it is possible to capture regional variations in sea level rise well. In the 1993–2012 period for instance, sea level rose substantially in the western tropical Pacific. The sharp rise in this area has been linked to increasing [[trade winds]], which occur when the [[Pacific Decadal Oscillation]] (PDO) and the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) change from one state to the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merrifield|first=Mark A.|last2=Thompson|first2=Philip R.|last3=Lander|first3=Mark|date=2012|title=Multidecadal sea level anomalies and trends in the western tropical Pacific|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=39|issue=13|pages=n/a|doi=10.1029/2012gl052032|issn=0094-8276}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PDO is a basin-wide climate pattern consisting of two phases, each commonly lasting 10 to 30 years, while the ENSO has a shorter period of 2 to 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mantua, N.J., Hare, S.R., Zhang, Y., Wallace, J.M., Francis, R.C. |title=A Pacific interdecadal climate oscillation with impacts on salmon production |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |volume=78 |pages=1069–79 |date=1997 |doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1997)078&lt;1069:APICOW&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode = 1997BAMS...78.1069M |issue=6 | issn = 1520-0477 |last2=Hare |last3=Zhang |last4=Wallace |last5=Francis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tide gauges ===
Another important source of sea-level observations comes from the global network of tide gauges. In contrast to the satellite record, this record has a lot of spatial and temporal gaps.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter03_FINAL.pdf|title=IPCC AR5 WGI|last=Rhein|first=Monika|last2=Rintoul|first2=Stephan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=285|chapter=Observations: Ocean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of tide gauges started primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, with data for the Southern Hemisphere remained scarce up to the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The longest running sea-level measurements, NAP or [[Amsterdam Ordnance Datum]] established in 1675, are recorded in [[Amsterdam]], [[the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psmsl.org/data/longrecords/|title=Other Long Records not in the PSMSL Data Set|publisher=PSMSL|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, record collection is also quite extensive, including measurements by an amateur meteorologist beginning in 1837 and measurements taken from a sea-level benchmark struck on a small cliff on the Isle of the Dead&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=John|author2=R. Coleman|author3=D. Pugh|date=April 2003|title=The Sea Level at Port Arthur, Tasmania, from 1841 to the Present|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=30|issue=7|pages=1401|bibcode=2003GeoRL..30.1401H|doi=10.1029/2002GL016813}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] convict settlement in 1841.

This network was used, in combination with satellite altimeter data, to establish that global mean sea-level rose {{Convert|19.5|cm||abbr=on}} between 1870 and 2004 at an average rate of about 1.44&amp;nbsp;mm/yr (1.7&amp;nbsp;mm/yr during the 20th century).&lt;ref name="church"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Church, J. A., White, N.J. |title=20th century acceleration in global sea-level rise |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=L01602 |date=2006 |doi=10.1029/2005GL024826 |bibcode=2006GeoRL..33.1602C|last2=White }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important confirmation of climate change simulations, predicting that SLR will accelerate in response to global warming. In [[Australia]], data collected by the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) show the current global mean sea level trend to be {{Convert|3.2|mm||abbr=on}} per year, a doubling of the rate during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmar.csiro.au/sealevel/sl_hist_last_decades.html|title=Historical sea level changes: Last decades|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cmar.csiro.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmar.csiro.au/sealevel/sl_hist_few_hundred.html|title=Historical Sea Level Changes|last=Neil|first=White|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some regional differences are also visible in the tide gauge data. Some of the recorded regional differences are due to differences in the actual sea level, while other are due to vertical land movements. In the United States for instance, considerable variation is found because some land areas are rising and some are sinking. Over the past 100 years, the rate of sea level rise varied from an increase of about {{convert|0.36|in|mm}} per year along the [[Louisiana]] Coast due to land sinking, to a drop of a few inches per decade in parts of [[Alaska]] due to [[post-glacial rebound]]. The rate of sea level rise increased during the 1993–2003 period compared with the longer-term average (1961–2003), although it is unclear whether the faster rate reflected a short-term variation or an increase in the long-term trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sea Level Changes| url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/recentslc.html | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | accessdate=Jan 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corp2400 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|upright|Close-up of [[Ross Ice Shelf]], the largest ice shelf of Antarctica, about the size of France and up to several hundred metres thick.]]
There are three main contributions to sea level rise. Oceans [[Thermal expansion|expand]] if they are warming, [[glacier]]s at high altitudes melt and the total mass of ice sheets decreases. Sea level rise in the last 150 years was dominated by retreat of glaciers and expansion of the ocean, but the contributions of the two large ice sheets (Greenland and Antarctica) is expected to increase in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Mengel"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mengel|first=Matthias|last2=Levermann|first2=Anders|last3=Frieler|first3=Katja|last4=Robinson|first4=Alexander|last5=Marzeion|first5=Ben|last6=Winkelmann|first6=Ricarda|date=2016-02-18|title=Future sea level rise constrained by observations and long-term commitment|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/02/17/1500515113|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=113|issue=10|language=en|pages=2597–602|doi=10.1073/pnas.1500515113|issn=0027-8424|pmid=26903648|pmc=4791025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ice sheets store most of the land ice (∼99.5%), with a sea-level equivalent (SLE) of {{Convert|7.4|m||abbr=on}} for Greenland and {{Convert|58.3|m||abbr=on}} for Antarctica.&lt;ref name="WCRP2018"/&gt;

Each year about {{Convert|8|mm||abbr=on}} of [[Precipitation#Measurement|precipitation (liquid equivalent)]] falls on the [[Antarctic ice sheet|ice sheets in Antarctica]] and [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]], mostly as snow, which accumulates and over time forms glacial ice. Much of this precipitation began as water vapor evaporated from the ocean surface. To a first approximation, the same amount of water appeared to return to the ocean in [[iceberg]]s and from ice melting at the edges. Scientists previously had estimated which is greater, ice going in or coming out, called the [[glacier mass balance]], important because a nonzero balance causes changes in global sea level. The rate of ice loss is accelerating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/346332/description/Sea_level_rise_overflowing_estimates ''Sea level rise overflowing estimates; Feedback mechanisms are speeding up ice melt''] November 8, 2012 [[Science News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ocean heating ===
{{Main|Ocean heat content}}[[File:Ocean Heat Content (2012).png|thumb|right|Ocean heat content (OHC), [http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/3M_HEAT_CONTENT/ NOAA] 2012]]
In terms of heat content, it is the world ocean that dominates the atmospheric climate. The oceans store more than 90% of the heat in Earth's climate system and act as a buffer against the effects of climate change. For instance, an average temperature increase of the entire world ocean by 0.01&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;!-- DO NOT use {{convert}} for Celsius temperature changes. --&gt; may seem small, but in fact it represents a very large increase in heat content. If all the heat associated with this anomaly was instantaneously transferred to the entire global atmosphere it would increase the average temperature of the atmosphere by approximately 10&lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;°C&lt;!-- DO NOT use {{convert}} for Celsius temperature changes. --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Levitus, S., Boyer, T., Antonov, J., Garcia, H., and Locarnini, R. (2005) [http://www.climatescience.gov/workshop2005/default.htm Ocean Warming 1955–2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717102249/http://www.climatescience.gov/workshop2005/default.htm|date=17 July 2009}}. Poster presented at the U.S. Climate Change Science Program Workshop, 14–16 November 2005, Arlington VA, Climate Science in Support of Decision-Making; Last viewed 22 May 2009 .&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a small change in the mean temperature of the ocean represents a very large change in the total heat content of the climate system. Of course, when the ocean gains heat the water expands and this represents a component of global sea-level rise.

The thermal expansion of water increases with temperature and pressure of the water. Hence, cold [[Arctic Ocean]] water will expand less for a given increase in temperature compared to warm tropical water. Because different climate models have slightly different patterns of ocean heating, they do not agree fully on the predictions for the contribution of ocean heating on sea level rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhlbrodt|first=T|last2=Gregory|first2=J.M.|date=2012|title=Ocean heat uptake and its consequences for the magnitude of sea level rise and climate change|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=39|issue=18|pages=|doi=10.1029/2012GL052952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antarctica===
[[Image:Antarctic shelf ice hg.png|thumb|Processes around an Antarctic ice shelf]]
The large volume of ice on the Antarctic continent stores around 70% of the world's fresh water.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question473.htm|title=How Stuff Works: polar ice caps|publisher=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2006-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Antarctica#Ice mass and global sea level|Antarctic ice sheet mass balance]] is affected by snowfall accumulations, and ice discharge along the periphery. Under the influence of global warming, melt at the base of the ice sheet increases. Simultaneously, the capacity of the atmosphere to carry precipitation increases with temperature so that precipitation, in the form of snowfall, increases. Furthermore, the additional snowfall causes increased ice flow which leads to further loss of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winkelmann|first=R.|last2=Levermann|first2=A.|last3=Martin|first3=M. A.|last4=Frieler|first4=K.|date=2012-12-12|title=Increased future ice discharge from Antarctica owing to higher snowfall|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11616|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=492|issue=7428|pages=239–242|doi=10.1038/nature11616|pmid=23235878|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====West Antarctica====
West Antarctica is currently experiencing a net outflow of glacial ice, which will increase global sea level over time. A review of the scientific studies looking at data from 1992 to 2017 suggests an increase in the melt from around 53 ± 29 Gt of ice per year to 159 ± 26 Gt.&lt;ref name="IMBIE2018" /&gt; Significant acceleration of outflow glaciers in the [[Amundsen Sea Embayment]] may have contributed to this increase.&lt;ref name="RignotBamber2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rignot|first1=E.|last2=Bamber|first2=J.

Further, thinning rates for the glaciers studied in 2002–2003 had increased over the values measured in the early 1990s.

Annual temperatures based on [[Byrd Station]] (central West Antarctica) from 1958 to 2010 increased linear by 2.4 ± 1.2&amp;nbsp;°C, the study authors note, "West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions globally.

[[File:West Antarctic Collapse.ogv|thumb|A graphical representation of how warm waters, and the Marine Ice Sheet Instability and Marine Ice Cliff Instability processes are affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]

Two types of instability are at play in West Antarctica. The first one is the [[Marine Ice Sheet Instability]], the bedrock on which parts of the ice sheet rest is moving deeper inland. This means that when a part of the ice sheet melts, a thicker part of the ice sheet is exposed, which may lead to additional ice loss. Secondly, melting of the [[ice shelf]]s, the floating extensions of the ice sheet, leads to a process named the Marine Ice Cliff Instability''.'' Because they function as a [[buttress]] to the ice sheet, their melt leads to additional ice flow. Melt of ice shelfs is accelerated when surface melt creates [[crevasse]]s and these crevasses cause fracturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattyn|first=Frank|date=2018|title=The paradigm shift in Antarctic ice sheet modelling|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05003-z|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=9|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1038/s41467-018-05003-z|issn=2041-1723|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since most of the [[bedrock]] underlying the West Antarctic Ice Sheet lies well below sea level and ocean waters are warming, the ice sheet is becoming less stable.&lt;ref name="Pollard2015"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature|year=2015|title=Potential Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat driven by hydrofracturing and ice cliff failure|authors=Pollard et al.|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X14007961|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2014.12.035}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rapid collapse of West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise sea level by {{convert|3.3|m|ft}} at an unknown rate.&lt;ref name="Bamber2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bamber J.L.|author2=Riva R.E.M.|author3=Vermeersen B.L.A.|author4=LeBroq A.M.|year=2009|title=Reassessment of the potential sea-level rise from a collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=324|issue=5929|pages=901–3|bibcode=2009Sci...324..901B|doi=10.1126/science.1169335|pmid=19443778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joughin|first=Ian|last2=Alley|first2=Richard B.|date=2011|title=Stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet in a warming world|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1194|journal=Nature Geoscience|language=En|volume=4|issue=8|pages=506–513|doi=10.1038/ngeo1194|issn=1752-0894|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thwaites glacier|Thwaites]] and [[Pine Island glacier|Pine Island]] glaciers have been identified to be potentially prone to these processes, since both glaciers bedrock [[topography]] gets deeper farther inland, exposing them to more warm water intrusion at the grounding line, and with the continued melt, retreat, eventually raising global sea levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/after-decades-of-ice-loss-antarctica-is-now-hemorrhaging-mass/562748/|work=The Atlantic|year=2018|title=After Decades of Losing Ice, Antarctica Is Now Hemorrhaging It}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glaciers-and-climate/ice-ocean-interactions/marine-ice-sheets/|work=AntarcticGlaciers.org|year=2014|title=Marine ice sheet instability}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greenland ===
[[File:Greenland ssi 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Greenland]] 2007 melt anomaly, measured as the difference between the number of days on which melting occurred in 2007 compared to the average annual melting days from 1988–2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=1784 Earth Observatory (2009) Melting Anomalies in Greenland in 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Most ice on Greenland is part of the [[Greenland ice sheet]] which rises to an average of {{Convert|2.135|km|}}. The rest of the ice on Greenland is part of isolated glaciers and ice caps.

The sources contributing to sea level rise from Greenland are from ice sheet melting (70%) and from glacier calving (30%). Dust, [[soot]], and microbes and algae living on parts of the ice sheet further enhance melting by darkening its surface and [[Thermal radiation#Surface effects|thus absorbing more]] [[thermal radiation]]; these regions grew by 12% between 2000 and 2012, and are likely to expand further. Estimates on future contribution to sea level rise from Greenland range from {{Convert|0.3 to 3|m||round=each}}, for the year 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://insideclimatenews.org/news/19042018/greenland-ice-sheet-melting-climate-change-arctic-pollution-sea-level-rise-algae-black-carbon|work=Inside Climate News|year=2018|author=Bob Berwyn|title=What's Eating Away at the Greenland Ice Sheet?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Greenland's largest outlet glaciers, such as [[Jakobshavn Isbræ]] and [[Kangerlussuaq Glacier]] have seen an acceleration in how fast they are flowing into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Joughin| journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume= 432| pages=608–610|date=December 2004 | pmid=15577906 | doi = 10.1038/nature03130 | title=Large fluctuations in speed on Greenland's Jakobshavn Isbræ glacier| first1=I| issue=7017|bibcode = 2004Natur.432..608J| ref=harv |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/environment/article301493.ece | work=[[The Independent]] | location=London | title=Melting Greenland glacier may hasten rise in sea level | first=Steve | last=Connor | date=2005-07-25 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown that this acceleration of [[outlet glacier]]s had mostly taken place on the Southern part of Greenland (66 N in 1996), but had spread further north (70 N) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Rignot |author2=Kanagaratnam, P| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5763/986?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=luckman&amp;searchid=1140284328766_4322&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;journalcode=sci | journal=Science| volume= 311| pages= 986–90| year= 2006 | title = Changes in the Velocity Structure of the Greenland Ice Sheet | doi = 10.1126/science.1121381 | pmid = 16484490| first1=E| issue=5763 |bibcode = 2006Sci...311..986R| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contribution of the Greenland ice sheet on sea level over the next couple of centuries can be very high due to a self-reinforcing cycle (a so-called [[positive feedback]]). After an initial period of melting, the height of the ice sheet will have lowered. As air temperature increases closer to the sea surface, more melt starts to occur. This melting may further be accelerated because the color of ice is darker while it is melting. There is a threshold in surface warming beyond which a partial or near-complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet occurs. Different research has put this threshold value as low as 1.0&amp;nbsp;°C, and definitely 4.0&amp;nbsp;°C, above pre-industrial temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Alexander|last2=Calov|first2=Reinhard|last3=Ganopolski|first3=Andrey|date=2012|title=Multistability and critical thresholds of the Greenland ice sheet|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1449|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=En|volume=2|issue=6|pages=429–432|doi=10.1038/nclimate1449|issn=1758-678X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ipcc13" /&gt;{{rp|1170}}

Accounting for the Greenland ice sheet, its peripheral glaciers and ice caps, contributions to current sea level rise have been estimated to be 43%.

===Glaciers===
{{Main|Retreat of glaciers since 1850|Glacier mass balance}}
Mountain glaciers include only a minor fraction of all water bound up in glaciers ice (&lt;1%), compared to a bigger portion in Greenland and Antarctica (99%). Still, mountain glaciers have contributed appreciably to historical sea level rise and are set to contribute a smaller, but still significant fraction of sea level rise in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radić|first=Valentina|last2=Hock|first2=Regine|date=2011-01-09|title=Regionally differentiated contribution of mountain glaciers and ice caps to future sea-level rise|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1052|journal=Nature Geoscience|language=En|volume=4|issue=2|pages=91–94|doi=10.1038/ngeo1052|issn=1752-0894}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roughly 200,000 glaciers on earth are spread out across all continents.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huss|first=Matthias|last2=Hock|first2=Regine|date=2015|title=A new model for global glacier change and sea-level rise|journal=Frontiers in Earth Science|language=English|volume=3|doi=10.3389/feart.2015.00054|issn=2296-6463}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different glaciers respond differently to increasing temperatures. For instance, valley glaciers that have a shallow slope already retreat under mild warming. Every glacier has a height above which there is net gain in mass and under which the glacier loses mass. If that height changes a bit, this has large consequences for glaciers with a shallow slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter04_FINAL.pdf|title=IPCC AR5 WGI|last=Vaughan|first=David G.|last2=Comiso|first2=Josefino C|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Observations: Cryosphere}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345}} A large set of glaciers drain into the ocean and ice loss can therefore increase when ocean temperatures increase.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Sea ice ===
Sea ice melt has a very small contribution to global sea level rise. According to [[Archimedes' principle]], sea ice that melts does not take up more volume than it had in the form of sea ice or icebergs. However, this only holds true in the case that the salinity of the sea ice and sea water are equal. This assumption is not valid in the case of melting sea ice, where the sea ice contains less salt than sea water. Fresh water has a larger volume compared to salt water, and as such there can be a small contribution of sea ice melt. In the case that all floating [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] and [[icebergs]] melt, the sea levels would rise only by about {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="NoerdlingerOthers2007a"&gt;Noerdlinger, P.D. and Brower, K.R., 2007.

=== Land water storage ===

Humans impact how much water is stored on land. Building [[dam]]s prevents large masses of water from flowing into the sea and therefore increases the storage of water on land. On the other hand humans extract water from [[lake]]s, [[wetland]]s and [[Aquifer|underground reservoirs]] for [[Food industry|food production]] leading to rising seas. Furthermore, the [[Water cycle|hydrological cycle]] is influenced by climate change and [[deforestation]], which can lead to further positive and negative contributions to sea level rise. In the 20th century, these processes roughly balanced, but dam building has slowed down and is expected to stay low for the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wada|first=Yoshihide|last2=Reager|first2=John T.|last3=Chao|first3=Benjamin F.|last4=Wang|first4=Jida|last5=Lo|first5=Min-Hui|last6=Song|first6=Chunqiao|last7=Li|first7=Yuwen|last8=Gardner|first8=Alex S.|date=2016|title=Recent Changes in Land Water Storage and its Contribution to Sea Level Variations|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10712-016-9399-6|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|language=en|volume=38|issue=1|pages=131–152|doi=10.1007/s10712-016-9399-6|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ipcc13" /&gt;{{rp|1155}}

== Models ==
There are broadly two ways of modelling sea level rise and making future [[General circulation model#Projections|projections]]. On the one hand, scientists use process-based modelling, where all relevant and well-understood physical processes are included in a physical model. An [[ice-sheet model]] is used to calculate the contributions of ice sheets and a [[general circulation model]] is used to compute the rising sea temperature and its expansion. A disadvantage of this method is that not all relevant processes might be understood to a sufficient level. Alternatively, some scientist use semi-empirical techniques that use geological data from the past to determine likely sea level responses to a warming world in addition to some basic physical modelling. Semi-empiral modelling relies on sophisticated statistical techniques.&lt;ref name="Mengel" /&gt; This type of modelling was partially motivated by the fact that in the 2007 IPCC report, most physical models underestimated the amount of sea level rise compared to observations.&lt;ref name="ipcc13" /&gt;

== Projections ==

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projection is based on several multi-century integrations of a [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory|GFDL]] [[global climate model|global coupled ocean-atmosphere model]]. These projections are the expected changes due to [[thermal expansion]] of sea water alone, and do not include the effect of melted continental [[ice sheet]]s. With the effect of ice sheets included the total rise will be larger, by an uncertain but possibly substantial factor.&lt;ref name="gfdl thermal expansion projections" /&gt; Image credit: [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] GFDL.]]

=== 21st century ===
The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has made predictions of sea level changes to the year 2100, using the available scientific literature. Their projections are based on the contributors to sea level rise, but do exclude some processes that are less understood. In the case of rapid cuts in emission (the so-called RCP2.6 scenario), the IPCC deem it likely that the sea level will rise to {{Convert|26–55|cm||abbr=on}} with a 67% [[confidence interval]]. The higher value should thus not be read as an upper limit, which can be substantially higher.

 | quote = (From pg 250) Even if sea-level rise were to remain in the conservative range projected by the IPCC (0.6–1.9 feet [0.18–0.59 m])—not considering potentially much larger increases due to rapid decay of the Greenland or West Antarctic ice sheets—tens of millions of people worldwide would become vulnerable to flooding due to sea-level rise over the next 50 years (Nicholls, 2004; Nicholls and Tol, 2006). This is especially true in densely populated, low-lying areas with limited ability to erect or establish protective measures. In the United States, the high end of the conservative IPCC estimate would result in the loss of a large portion of the nation's remaining coastal wetlands. The impact on the east and Gulf coasts of the United States of 3.3 feet (1 m) of sea-level rise, which is well within the range of more recent projections for the 21st century (e.g., Pfeffer et al., 2008; Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009), is shown in pink in [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12782&amp;page=251#p2001c3c59960251001 Figure 7.7]. Also shown, in red, is the effect of 19.8 feet (6 m) of sea-level rise, which could occur over the next several centuries if warming were to continue unabated.

Here, we present a consistent record of mass balance for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets over the past two decades, validated by the comparison of two independent techniques over the past eight years: one differencing perimeter loss from net accumulation, and one using a dense time series of timevariable gravity. We find excellent agreement between the two techniques for absolute mass loss and acceleration of mass loss.

A 2016 study concluded that based on [[MIS 5e|past climate change]] data, sea level rise could accelerate exponentially in the coming decades, with a doubling time of 10, 20 or 40 years, respectively, raising the ocean by several meters, in 50, 100 or 200 years.&lt;ref name="Hansen2016"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2 °C global warming could be dangerous|url=https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/16/3761/2016/acp-16-3761-2016.html|author1=J.

One 2017 study's scenario, assuming high [[fossil fuel]] use for combustion and strong economic growth during this century, projects sea level rise of up to {{convert|1.32|m|feet}} on average — and an extreme scenario with as much as {{convert|1.89|m|feet}}, by 2100.

&lt;/ref&gt; IPCC [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|AR4]] estimated that at least a partial deglaciation of the [[Greenland ice sheet]], and possibly the [[West Antarctic ice sheet]], would occur given a global average temperature increase of 1–4&amp;nbsp;°C &lt;!-- Do not simply put {convert} to °F here as it is not 1–4 °C above 0°C but 1–4 °C change from average --&gt; (relative to temperatures over the years 1990–2000).&lt;ref&gt;IPCC AR4, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/spm.html Summary for Policymakers],

== Regional sea level rise ==
[[Subsidence]], [[Post-glacial rebound|isostatic rebound]], gravitational effects of changing ice masses, and spatially varying patterns of warming lead to differences in sea level rise around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katsman|first=Caroline A.|last2=Sterl|first2=A.|last3=Beersma|first3=J.

Many ports, urban conglomerations, and agricultural regions are built on [[river delta]]s, where subsidence of land contributes to a substantially increased ''effective'' sea level rise. This is caused by both unsustainable extraction of groundwater (in some places also by extraction of oil and gas), and by [[levee]]s and other flood management practices that prevent accumulation of sediments from compensating for the natural settling of deltaic soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Bucx|Marchand|Makaske|van de Guchte|2010|p=88}};{{Harvnb|Tessler|Vörösmarty|Grossberg|Gladkova|2015|p=638}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many deltas, this results in subsidence ranging from several millimeters per year up to possibly 25 centimeters per year in parts of the Ciliwung delta ([[Jakarta]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Bucx|Marchand|Makaske|van de Guchte|2010|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total anthropogenic-caused subsidence in the [[Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]] (Netherlands) is estimated at {{Cvt|3 to 4|m|}}, over {{Cvt|3|m|}} in urban areas of the [[Mississippi River Delta]] ([[New Orleans]]), and over {{Cvt|9|m|}} in the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Bucx|Marchand|Makaske|van de Guchte|2010|pp=81, 88,90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current and future climate change is set to have a number of impacts, particularly on [[coast]]al systems. Such impacts include increased [[coastal erosion]], higher [[storm surge|storm-surge]] flooding, inhibition of [[primary production]] processes, more extensive coastal inundation, changes in surface [[water quality]] and groundwater characteristics, increased loss of property and coastal habitats, increased flood risk and potential loss of life, loss of non-monetary cultural resources and values, impacts on agriculture and [[aquaculture]] through decline in soil and water quality, and loss of tourism, recreation, and transportation functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|356}}

Many of these impacts are detrimental — especially for the three-quarters of the world's poor who depend on agriculture systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Climate Shocks: Risk and Vulnerability in an Unequal World|title=Human Development Report 2007/2008|pages=71–107|journal=United Nations Development Programme|year=2009|doi=10.1057/9780230598508_3|isbn=978-0-230-54704-9|last1=Watkins|first1=Kevin|last2=Program|first2=United Nations Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the great diversity of coastal environments; regional and local differences in projected relative sea level and climate changes; and differences in the resilience and adaptive capacity of [[ecosystem]]s, sectors, and countries, the impacts will be highly variable in time and space. [[River delta]]s and small island states are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise.

Globally tens of millions of people will be displaced in the latter decades of the century if greenhouse gases are not reduced drastically. Many coastal areas have large population growth, which results in more people at risk from sea level rise. The rising seas pose both a direct risk: unprotected homes can be flooded, and indirect threats of higher storm surges, tsunamis and king tides.

Ten per cent of the world's population live in coastal areas that are less than {{Convert|10|m|feet}} above sea level.

Rising seas has also been tied to an increased risk from [[tsunami]]s, potentially affecting coastal cities in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2018/08/15/Sea-level-to-increase-risk-of-deadly-tsunamis/2361534362716/|title=Sea level to increase risk of deadly tsunamis|year=2018|website=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food production in coastal areas is affected by rising sea levels as well. Due to flooding and salt water intrusion into the soil, the salinity of agricultural lands near the sea increases, posing problems for crops that are not salt-resistant. Furthermore, salt intrusion in fresh irrigation water poses a second problem for crops that are irrigated. Newly developed salt-resistant crop variants are currently more expensive than the crops they are set to replace.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nibio.no/nyheter/food-security-threatened-by-sea-level-rise|title=Food security threatened by sea-level rise|last=Nagothu|first=Udaya Sekhar|date=2017-01-18|website=|publisher=Nibio|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farmland in the [[Nile Delta]] is affected by salt water flooding&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;, and there is now more salt in the soil and irrigation water in the [[Red River Delta]] and the [[Mekong Delta]] in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Bangladesh and China are affected in a similar way, particularly their rice production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/climpag/pub/EIre0047_en.asp|title=Potential Impacts of Sea-Level Rise on Populations and Agriculture|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fao.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Island nations ===
{{further|Alliance of Small Island States|Small Island Developing States}}[[Atoll]]s and low-lying coastal areas on islands are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise. Possible impacts include [[coastal erosion]], floodings and salt intrusion [[Soil salinization|into soils]] and freshwater. It is difficult to assess how much of past erosion and floods have been caused by sea level change, compared to other environmental events such as hurricanes. Adaptation to sea level rise is costly for small island nation as a large portion of their population lives in areas that are at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/WGIIAR5-Chap29_FINAL.pdf|title=AR5 WGII|last=Nurse|first=Leonard A.|last2=McLean|first2=Roger|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Barros|editor-first=VR|location=|pages=|chapter=29: Small Islands|editor-last2=Field}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:TWSeaLevelRise1.gif|thumb|right|Schematic animation of projected sea level rise around [[Taiwan]]]]

These effects include the immediate erosion and subsequent regrowth process that may vary in length from decades to centuries, even resulting in land areas larger than pre-storm values. With an expected rise in the frequency and intensity of storms, they may become more significant in determining island shape and size than sea level rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Murray R.|last2=Kench|first2=Paul S.|title=Spatiotemporal variability of typhoon impacts and relaxation intervals on Jaluit Atoll, Marshall Islands|journal=Geology|volume=44|issue=2|pages=159–162|doi=10.1130/g37402.1|bibcode=2016Geo....44..159F|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five of the [[Solomon Islands]] have disappeared due to the combined effects of sea level rise and stronger trade winds that were pushing water into the Western Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2087356-five-pacific-islands-vanish-from-sight-as-sea-levels-rise/|title=Five Pacific islands vanish from sight as sea levels rise|last=Klein|first=Alice|website=New Scientist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case all islands of an island nation become uninhabitable or completely submerged by the sea, the states themselves would also become dissolved. Once this happens, all rights on the surrounding area (sea) are removed. This area can be huge as rights extend to a radius of {{Convert|224|nmi|}} around the entire island state. Any resources, such as fossil oil, minerals and metals, within this area can be freely dug up by anyone and sold without needing to pay any commission to the (now dissolved) island state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|trans-title=Sea borders and rising sea levels: international law considerations about the effects of rising sea levels on borders at sea: speech, pronounced with the acceptance of the post of professor in international law at the University of Utrecht on 13 April 1989 |title=Zeegrenzen en zeespiegelrijzing : volkenrechtelijke beschouwingen over de effecten van het stijgen van de zeespiegel op grenzen in zee : rede, uitgesproken bij de aanvaarding van het ambt van hoogleraar in het volkenrecht aan de Rijksuniversiteit te Utrecht op donderdag 13 april 1989 |author=Alfred Henry Adriaan Soons |year=1989 |publisher=Kluwers |language=Dutch |isbn=978-90-268-1925-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecosystems===
Coastal ecosystems are facing drastic changes as a consequence of rising sea levels. Many systems might ultimately be lost when sea levels rise too much or too fast. Some ecosystems can move land inward with the high-water mark, but many are prevented from migrating due to natural or man-made barriers. This 'coastal squeeze' could result in the loss of habitats such as [[mudflat]]s and [[marsh]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://datazone.birdlife.org/sea-level-rise-poses-a-major-threat-to-coastal-ecosystems-and-the-biota-they-support|title=Sea level rise poses a major threat to coastal ecosystems and the biota they support|last=|first=|date=2015|website=birdlife.org|publisher=Birdlife International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mangroves]] and [[Tidal marsh|tidal marshes]] adjust to rising sea levels by building vertically using accumulated [[sediment]] and [[organic matter]].

When seawater reaches inland, problems related to contaminated soils may occur. Also, fish, birds, and coastal plants could lose parts of their habitat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocean.nationalgeographic.com/ocean/critical-issues-sea-level-rise/ "Sea Level Rise" National Geographic.]&lt;/ref&gt; Coral, important for bird and fish life, needs to grow vertically to remain close to the sea surface in order to get enough energy from sunlight.

==Adaptation==
{{further|Adaptation to global warming}}
[[File:People's Climate March 2017 in Washington DC 37.jpg|thumb|Placard "The sea is rising", at the [[People's Climate March (2017)]].]]
[[File:Beach restoration device.jpg|thumb|Beach nourishment in progress in [[Barcelona]].]]

Adaptation options to sea level rise can be broadly classified into ''retreat, accommodate'' and ''protect''. Retreating is moving people and [[infrastructure]] to less exposed areas and preventing further development in areas that are at risk. This type of adaptation is potentially disruptive, as displacement of people might lead to tensions. Accommodation options are measurements that make societies more flexible to sea level rise. Examples are the [[Agriculture|cultivation]] of food crops that tolerate a high salt content in the soil and making new [[Building code|building standards]] which require building to be built higher and have less damage in the case a flood does occur. Finally, areas can be protected by the construction of dams, dikes and by improving natural defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomsen|first=Dana C.|last2=Smith|first2=Timothy F.|last3=Keys|first3=Noni|date=2012|title=Adaptation or Manipulation? Unpacking Climate Change Response Strategies|jstor=26269087|journal=Ecology and Society|volume=17|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://apo.org.au/system/files/34006/apo-nid34006-64741.pdf|title=Costs and coasts: an empirical assessment of physical and institutional climate adaptation pathways|last=Fletcher|first=Cameron|last2=Taylor|first2=BM|last3=Rambaldi|first3=AN|last4=Harman|first4=BP|last5=Heyenga|first5=S|last6=Ganegodage|first6=KR|last7=Lipkin|first7=F|last8=McAllister|first8=RRJ|publisher=the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility|year=2013|isbn=|location=Cold Coast|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These adaptation options can be further divided into ''hard'' and ''soft''. Hard adaptation relies mostly on capital-intensive human-built infrastructure and involves large-scale changes to human societies and ecological systems. Because of its large scale, it is often not flexible. Soft adaptation involves strengthening natural defenses and adaptation strategies in local communities and the use of simple and modular technology, which can be locally owned. The two types of adaptation might be complementary or mutually exclusive. The building of a dike (hard adaptation) for instance destroys the natural dune system and dune nourishment will not be possible anymore.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sovacool|first=Benjamin K.|date=2011|title=Hard and soft paths for climate change adaptation|url=http://www.adaptation-undp.org/sites/default/files/downloads/sovacool-cp-hardsoft.pdf|journal=Climate policy|volume=11|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries are developing concrete plans for adaptation. An example is the extension of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Delta Works]]. In 2008, the Dutch ''Delta Commission'', advised in a report that the Netherlands would need a massive new building program to strengthen the country's water defenses against the anticipated [[effects of global warming]] for the next 190 years. This included drawing up worst-case plans for evacuations. The plan also included more than €100 billion (US${{To USD|100|EUR|round=yes}} billion) in new spending through to the year 2100 to implement precautionary measures, such as broadening coastal [[dunes]] and strengthening sea and river [[Dyke (construction)|dikes]]. The commission said the country must plan for a rise in the [[North Sea]] up to {{convert|1.3|m||0|sigfig=1}} by 2100 and plan for a 2-4 m rise by 2200.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/news/03iht-03dutch.15877468.html|title=Dutch draw up drastic measures to defend coast against rising seas|last=|first=|date=3 September 2008|work=New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a quarter of the Netherlands lies beneath sea level, while more than 50% of the nation's area would be inundated by tidal floods if it did not have an [[Flood control in the Netherlands|extensive levee system]].

The [[New York City Panel on Climate Change]] (NPCC) is an effort to prepare the New York City area for climate change. [[Miami Beach]] is spending $500 million from 2015 to 2020 to address sea-level rise. Actions include a pump drainage system, and raising of roadways and sidewalks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dr20150406-500-million-5year-plan-to-help-miami-beach-withstand-sealevel-rise|title=$500 million, 5-year plan to help Miami Beach withstand sea-level rise|date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. coastal cities also conduct so called ''beach nourishment'', also known as ''beach replenishment'', where new beach sand is trucked in and added.&lt;ref name="ClimateCentral2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/its-beach-season-enjoy-it-while-you-can|title=Climate Change, Sea Level Rise Spurring Beach Erosion|year=2012|website=Climate Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Options that have been proposed to assist island nations to [[Adaptation to global warming|adapt]] to rising sea level include abandoning islands, building dikes, and "building upwards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.risingsea.net/Maldives/Small_Island_States_3.html|title=Policy Implications of Sea Level Rise: The Case of the Maldives|website=Proceedings of the Small Island States Conference on Sea Level Rise.

A '''Slavic name suffix''' is a common way of forming [[patronymic]]s, [[surname|family name]]s, and pet names in the [[Slavic languages]] (also called the Slavonic languages). Many, if not most, Slavic last names are formed by adding [[possessive suffix|possessive]] and other [[suffix]]es to [[given names]] and other words. Most Slavic surnames have suffixes which are found in varying degrees over the different nations. Some surnames are not formed in this way, including names of non-Slavic origin. 

Note: the following list does not take regional spelling variations into account.
* ''-ov / -ev (-ova/-eva)'': [[Russia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Serbia]] (especially frequent in [[Vojvodina]]), [[Croatia]] (rare) (Almost always ''-iv'' in [[Ukraine]]) and [[Czechoslovakia]] (feminine forms only); this has been adopted by many non-Slavic peoples of Central Asia who are or have been under Russian rule, such as the [[Tatars]], [[Chechens]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Kazakhs]], etc. Note that ''-ev'' is the soft form of ''-ov'', found after [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] [[consonants]] or [[sibilants]]. The suffix -off comes from the [[French language|French]] transliteration of -ov, based on the Muscovite pronunciation.
* ''-sky (-ska), -ski (-ska), -skiy (-skaya)'': [[Poland]], Ukraine, Russia, Czech Republic (-ský (-ská)), Slovakia (-ský/-sky (-ská/-ska)), Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia, Serbia (especially in Vojvodina), Croatia.
* Note that these first two can be combined: ''-ovsky'' (''-ovska''), ''-owski'' (''-owska''), ''-ovskiy (-ovskaya)'':  Republic of Macedonia, [[Belarus]], Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Ukraine, Serbia, Croatia.
* ''-ić -vić -ović -ič -vič -ovič -ich, -vich, -vych, -ovich, -owicz/-ewicz'': Serbia, Croatia, [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]], [[Slovenia]], Belarus, Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, Russia, Republic of Macedonia (rare), occasionally Bulgaria. Yugoslav ex.: Petrović, means Petar's son. In Russia, where patronyms are used, a person may have two ''-(ov)ich'' names in a row; first the patronym, then the family name (see [[Shostakovich]]).
* ''-in (-ina)'': Russia, Serbia (especially in Vojvodina), Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia (rare)
* ''-ko'': Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Belarus, also in Russia
* ''-nko, -enko'': of Ukrainian origin in Ukraine, Belarus, also in Russia
* ''-enkov (-enkova)'': of Ukrainian origin in Ukraine, Belarus, also common in Russia and Bulgaria.
* ''-ak/-ek/-ik (-akova/-ekova/-ikova)'': Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, very rarely{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} in Bulgaria.
* ''-uk, -yuk'': Ukraine
* ''-chuk'': Ukraine, Belarus; in Poland as ''-czyk''
* ''-ac/-ec'': Slovenia and Croatia (both versions), Serbia (only -ac), Czech Republic and Slovakia (only -ec), Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine (as ''ец'', ''-ets'').

An example using an occupation is ''[[Kovač (surname)|kovač]]'', ''[[koval]]'' or ''[[Kowal (surname)|kowal]]'', which means blacksmith.  It is the root of the names [[Kovačević]], [[Kovačić (surname)|Kovačić]], [[Kowalski]], [[Kowalchuk]], [[Kowalczyk]], [[Kovalenko]], [[Kovalyov]], and [[Kovalev]].  All mean "descendant of a blacksmith".

The given name Petr or Petro (equivalent to Peter) can become [[Petrov (surname)|Petrov]], Petriv, Petriw, [[Petrovsky (disambiguation)|Petrovsky]], Petrovich, and [[Petric (disambiguation)|Petric]].  All mean "descendant of Peter".  This is similar to the use of "-son" or "-sen" in [[Germanic languages]].

In [[East Slavic languages]] (Belarusian, Russian, Rusyn, and Ukrainian) the same system of name suffixes can be used to express several meanings.  One of the most common is the patronymic.  Instead of a secondary "middle" given name, people identify themselves with their given and family name and patronymic, a name based on their father's given name.  If a man gives his full name as Boris ''Vladimirovich'' Kuznetsov, then his father's name must have been Vladimir: Vladimirovich in this case literally means "Vladimir's son".

Similarly, many suffixes can be attached to express affection or informality (in linguistics, called a [[diminutive]]).  For example, calling a boy named Ivan "Ivanko" or Yuri "Yurko" expresses that he is familiar to you. This is the same as referring to Robert to "Rob," "Bob" and "Bobby"; and William to "Bill", "Will" and "Willy".

{{Main|List of Star Wars films and television series}}
The ''Star Wars'' film series centers around a "trilogy of trilogies" (also referred to as the "Skywalker saga"&lt;ref name=IXcast/&gt; or the "''Star Wars'' saga"). They were released out of sequence: the original (Episodes ''IV–VI'', 1977–83), prequel (Episodes ''I–III'', 1999–2005), and sequel (Episodes ''VII–IX'', 2015–19) trilogy. The first two trilogies were released on three year intervals, the sequel trilogy films two years apart. Each trilogy centers on a generation of the [[The Force|Force]]-sensitive [[Skywalker family]]. The prequels focus on [[Anakin Skywalker]], the original trilogy on his son [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]], and the sequels on Luke's nephew [[Kylo Ren]].

A theatrical animated film, ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|The Clone Wars]]'' (2008), was released as a pilot to a [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|TV series of the same name]].

According to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films.&lt;ref name=kurtz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theforce.net/latestnews/story/gary_kurtz_reveals_original_plans_for_episodes_19_80270.asp|title=Gary Kurtz Reveals Original Plans for Episodes 1-9|website=TheForce.net|date=May 26, 1999|accessdate=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.jeditemplearchives.com/specialreports/banthatracks/archives/banthatracks08.pdf|magazine=Bantha Tracks|title=Interview: George Lucas|issue=8|year=1980|last=Lucas|first=George}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy and pressure from his wife to settle down, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=494}}

Technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create [[computer-generated imagery]], inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequel trilogy would be "unbelievably expensive."{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=303}} The popularity of the franchise had been prolonged by the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]], so that it still had a large audience. A theatrical [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases|rerelease]] "updated" the original trilogy with the style of CGI envisioned for the new films.

''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' was released on May 19, 1999, and ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' on May 16, 2002, both to mixed reviews.

Lucas decided to leave the franchise in the hands of other filmmakers, announcing in January 2012 that he would step away from making blockbuster films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/17/george-lucas-done-with-star-wars-red-tails_n_1210951.html |title=George Lucas Done With 'Star Wars' Fanboys, Talks 'Red Tails' |last= |first=|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequel trilogy focuses on the journey of the orphaned scavenger Rey following in the footsteps of the Jedi with the guidance of the reluctant last Jedi, Luke Skywalker. Along with ex-stormtrooper Finn, she helps the Resistance led by Leia fight the First Order commanded by [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] and his pupil [[Kylo Ren]] (Han Solo and Leia's son). ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|Episode VII: The Force Awakens]]'' was released on December 18, 2015, ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|Episode VIII: The Last Jedi]]'' on December 15, 2017, and ''[[Star Wars: Episode IX|Episode IX]]'' is due to be released on December 20, 2019.

===Standalone films===
In his initial planning following the success of ''Star Wars'', Lucas planned a few standalone films separate from the Skywalker saga.&lt;ref name=PrevueLucas/&gt; Theatrical films outside the main episodic series have their origin in the [[Ewok]] spin-off films ''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]'' (1984) and ''[[Ewoks: Battle for Endor]]'' (1985), which were screened internationally after being produced for television. Although based on story ideas from Lucas, they do not bear ''Star Wars'' in their titles, and were considered to exist in a lower level of canon than the episodic films.

After the conclusion of his then six-episode saga in 2005, Lucas continued developing spin-offs in the form of television series and theatrical films.

====Anthology films====
{{Further|List of Star Wars films and television series#Anthology films}}
Before selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, and parallel to his development of a sequel trilogy, George Lucas and original trilogy co-screenwriter [[Lawrence Kasdan]] started development on a [[standalone film]] about a young Han Solo.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; On February 5, 2013, Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] made public the development of the Kasdan film, along with an undisclosed film written by Simon Kinberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney Earnings Beat; 'Star Wars' Spinoffs Planned|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100434935|accessdate=February 5, 2013|newspaper=CNBC|date= February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney [[Chief financial officer|CFO]] [[Jay Rasulo]] has described the standalone films as [[origin story|origin stories]].&lt;ref name="Graser"/&gt;

Lucasfilm and Kennedy have stated that the standalone films would be referred to as the ''Star Wars'' anthology series&lt;ref name="Entertainment Weekly"/&gt; (albeit the word anthology has not been used in any of the titles, instead carrying the promotional ''"A Star Wars Story"'' subtitle. Focused on how the rebels obtained the [[Death Star]] plans from the 1977 film, the first anthology film, ''[[Rogue One]]'', was released on December 16, 2016 to favorable reviews and box office success. The second, ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'', centered on a young Han Solo with Chewbacca and Lando as supporting characters, was released on May 25, 2018 to mixed reviews and underperformance at the box office. Despite this, more anthology films are expected to be released.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/multiple-films-star-wars-pipeline-sources-56057987|title='Multiple films' still in 'Star Wars' pipeline, sources say|date=June 21, 2018|publisher=ABC|website=[[Good Morning America]]|accessdate=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planned spin-off series===
In November 2017, Lucasfilm announced that [[Rian Johnson]], the writer/director of ''The Last Jedi'', would be working on a new trilogy. The films will reportedly differ from the Skywalker-focused films in favor of focusing on new characters. Johnson is confirmed to write and direct the first film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/rian-johnson-writer-director-of-star-wars-the-last-jedi-to-create-all-new-star-wars-trilogy|title=Rian Johnson, Writer-Director of ''Star Wars: The Last Jedi'', to Create All-New ''Star Wars'' Trilogy|website=StarWars.com|date=November 9, 2017|accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, it was announced that [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B.

From 1977 to 2014, the term ''Expanded Universe'' (EU) was an umbrella term for all officially licensed ''Star Wars'' storytelling material set outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games.&lt;ref name="KurtzBourdaa2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benjamin W.L.

All future projects and creative developments across all types of media would be overseen and coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of Lucasfilm created to maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise.&lt;ref name="SW Legends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars Expanded Universe'' Turns a New Page|website=StarWars.com|date=April 25, 2014|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple comics series from [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and novels published by [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] were produced after the announcement.

===Merchandising===
{{Main|Kenner Star Wars action figures|List of Kenner Star Wars action figures|Star Wars: The Vintage Collection|Lego Star Wars|List of Lego Star Wars sets|Star Wars trading card|Star Wars role-playing games}}
The success of the ''Star Wars'' films led the franchise to become one of the most merchandised franchises in the world. While filming the original 1977 film, George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchise's merchandising rights. The first six films produced approximately {{US$|20}}{{nbsp}}billion in merchandising revenue.&lt;ref name=merch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/george-lucas-star-wars-288513|title=The Real Force Behind 'Star Wars': How George Lucas Built an Empire|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 9, 2012|accessdate=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenner]] made the first ''Star Wars'' [[action figure]]s to coincide with the release of the film, and today the original figures are highly valuable. Since the 1990s, Hasbro holds the rights to create action figures based on the saga. [[Star Wars Pez|Pez dispensers]] began to be produced in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Chertoff and Susan Kahn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uuDcU7-EIdAC&amp;pg=PA87 "''Star Wars''"], ''Celebrating Pez'' (Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2006), 87.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Wars'' was the first [[intellectual property]] to be licensed in [[Lego]] history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/games/885284-lego-gets-lord-of-the-rings-and-hobbit-licence|title=Lego gets Lord Of The Rings and Hobbit licence|website=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lego has produced animated parody short films and mini-series to promote their [[Lego Star Wars|''Star Wars'' sets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars7news.com/2015/02/new-lego-star-wars-mini-series-coming-to-disneyxd.html|title=Star Wars Episode 7 News - New LEGO Star Wars Mini-Series Retelling the Whole Saga Coming to DisneyXD|author=Link Voxx|publisher=Star Wars Episode 7 News|access-date=January 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150819074538/http://www.starwars7news.com/2015/02/new-lego-star-wars-mini-series-coming-to-disneyxd.html|archive-date=August 19, 2015|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lego Star Wars (video game series)|Lego ''Star Wars'' video games]] are critically acclaimed bestsellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/02/lego-star-wars-ii-developer-diary | title = LEGO Star Wars II: Developer Diary | author = [[LucasArts]] | date = March 2, 2006 | website = [[IGN]] | publisher = [[IGN Entertainment]] | accessdate = September 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/05/top-10-april-2009-games/|title=April 2009's Top 10 Game Sales, By Platform|last=Kohler|first=Chris|date=May 15, 2009|publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''|accessdate=September 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the board game ''Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star'' was released,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4845/star-wars--escape-from-death-star-game | title = Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star | year = 1977 | type = description | publisher = Board game geek}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to be confused with the board game with the same name published in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2725/star-wars-escape-from-the-death-star | title = Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star | year = 1990 | type = description | publisher = Board game geek}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Monopoly Star Wars|Star Wars Monopoly]]'' and themed versions of ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'' and [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]] were released in 1997, with updated versions released in subsequent years. The board game ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'' has been adapted in two editions by [[Hasbro]]: ''[[Star Wars Risk: The Clone Wars Edition|The Clone Wars Edition]]'' (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 23, 2009|url= http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15045|title= Star Wars Clone Wars Edition|publisher=Hasbro}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Risk: Star Wars Original Trilogy Edition|Original Trilogy Edition]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 23, 2009|publisher=Board game geek|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/22551|title=Risk Star Wars: The Original Trilogy Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three ''Star Wars'' tabletop [[role-playing game]]s have been developed: [[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game|a version by West End Games]] in the 1980s and 1990s, [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Wizards of the Coast)|one by Wizards of the Coast]] in the 2000s, and [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Fantasy Flight Games)|one by Fantasy Flight Games]] in the 2010s.

''Star Wars'' [[Star Wars Trading Cards|trading cards]] have been published since the first "blue" series, by [[Topps]], in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://starwarscards.net/|title=Star Wars Trading Cards|website=Starwarscards.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of series have been produced, with Topps being the licensed creator in the United States. Some of the card series are of film stills, while others are original art. Many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very rare "promos", such as the 1993 Galaxy Series II "floating Yoda" P3 card often commanding US$1,000 or more. While most "base" or "common card" sets are plentiful, many "insert" or "[[Trading card|chase cards]]" are very rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate= March 28, 2008|url= http://theswca.com/textf/promo.html | title = Star Wars Promotional Trading Card List |publisher=The Star Wars Collectors Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995 until 2001, [[Decipher, Inc.]] had the license for, created and produced a collectible card game based on ''Star Wars''; the ''Star Wars Collectible Card Game'' (also known as [[SWCCG]]).

==Themes==
{{See also|Star Wars sources and analogues}}
Aside from its well-known [[technology in Star Wars|science fictional technology]], ''Star Wars'' features elements such as [[knighthood]], [[chivalry]], and princesses that are related to archetypes of the fantasy genre.&lt;ref name="EmpireOfDreams"&gt;{{Cite video|title=[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]|medium=DVD|date=2004|publisher=Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Star Wars'' world, unlike science fiction that features sleek and futuristic settings, is portrayed as dirty and grimy. Lucas' vision of a "used future" was further popularized in the science fiction films ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'',&lt;ref name="Legacy"&gt;{{Cite video|title=The Force Is With Them: The Legacy of Star Wars|publisher=Star Wars Original Trilogy DVD Box Set: Bonus Materials|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was set on an aged space freighter; ''[[Mad Max 2]]'', which is set in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] desert; and ''[[Blade Runner]]'', which is set in a crumbling, [[dystopia]]n city of the future. Lucas made a conscious effort to parallel scenes and dialogue between films, and especially the journey of Anakin Skywalker in the prequels with that of his son Luke.

===Historical influences===
[[Political science]] has been an important element of ''Star Wars'' since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between [[democracy]] and [[dictatorship]]. McQuarrie's designs for Darth Vader, initially inspired by [[Japanese armour|Samurai armor]], also incorporated a [[Stahlhelm|German military helmet]].&lt;ref name=wpo&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ralph-mcquarrie-artist-who-drewdarth-vader-c-3po-dies-at-82/2012/03/04/gIQAY2AYrR_story.html|title=Ralph McQuarrie, artist who drew Darth Vader, C-3PO, dies at 82|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Rees Shapiro, T.|accessdate=October 2, 2018|date=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbey|first=Ryan|title=John Mollo obituary: Star Wars costume designer who dressed Darth Vader |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/01/john-mollo-obituary|website=The Guardian|language=en|date= November 1, 2017|accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space battles in ''A New Hope'' were based on [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] [[dogfight]]s,&lt;ref name="Dreams"&gt;{{cite AV media |title=[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]] |date=2004 |medium=documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Imperial stormtrooper|stormtroopers]] borrow the name of [[Nazi]] [[Stormtrooper|"shock" troopers]].

World War II terms were used for names in the films; ''e.g.'' the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group of [[Kessel (cauldron)|encircled forces]]) and [[Hoth]] ([[Hermann Hoth]] was a German general who served on the snow-laden Eastern Front).&lt;ref name="christopherklein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-real-history-that-inspired-star-wars|title=The Real History That Inspired "Star Wars"|author=Christopher Klein|publisher=HISTORY.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palpatine being a [[chancellor]] before becoming the [[Emperor]] in the prequel trilogy alludes to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s role as chancellor before appointing himself ''[[Führer]]''.&lt;ref name=ss/&gt; Lucas has also drawn parallels to historical dictators such as [[Julius Caesar]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Star Wars: Attack of the Clones |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020429/story2.html|work=[[Time Magazine|Time]]|date=April 21, 2002|accessdate=December 13, 2009|quote=The people give their democracy to a dictator, whether it's [[Julius Caesar]] or [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] or [[Adolf Hitler]].

On the inspiration for the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] formed "from the ashes of the Empire", ''The Force Awakens'' director [[J.J.

===Industry===
The original ''Star Wars'' film was a huge success for [[20th Century Fox]], and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million.&lt;ref name="Dreams"/&gt; The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt [[production company]] to a thriving media conglomerate.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=David A.|title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in the Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam, 1970–1979|date=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-23265-5|edition=1st paperback print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars'' fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and [[irony]] to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before ''Star Wars'', special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Bigsby&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bigsby|first1=Christopher|title=The Cambridge Companion to Modern American Culture|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-84132-0|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial success of ''Star Wars'' created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; Along with ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''Star Wars'' started the tradition of the summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable [[Media franchise|franchises]] are important.&lt;ref name="chicago"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-0505080390may08,0,5905863,full.story |title=The power of the dark side |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=May 8, 2005 |accessdate=June 13, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522062851/http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-0505080390may08,0,5905863,full.story |archivedate=May 22, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt;

====Fan works====
{{Main|Star Wars fan films}}
The ''Star Wars'' saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the ''Star Wars'' galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing [[fan fiction]] to creating [[fan film]]s. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual [[The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards|Official ''Star Wars'' Fan Film Awards]], officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential [[copyright]] and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to [[parody|parodies]], [[mockumentary|mockumentaries]], and documentaries. Fan fiction films set in the ''Star Wars'' universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=March 28, 2008|url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25279212_ITM |title=Filmmaker Kevin Smith Hosts 'The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards' on SCI FI Channel; George Lucas to Present Special Honor | publisher = [[Business Wire]]|date=April 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = Sarah | last= Knapton|title= Court to rule in Star Wars costume battle|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2271561,00.html|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date = April 7, 2008|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
As the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource.  For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fh6xn3yd3x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Multiliterate+Star+Warians+:+the+force+of+popular+culture+and+ICT+in+early+learning&amp;rft.jtitle=Australasian+Journal+of+Early+Childhood&amp;rft.au=Hesterman,+Sandra&amp;rft.date=2011-12-01&amp;rft.issn=1836-9391&amp;rft.volume=36&amp;rft.issue=4&amp;rft.spage=86&amp;rft.epage=95&amp;rft.externalDBID=n/a&amp;rft.externalDocID=190269&amp;paramdict=en-US|title=Multiliterate Star Warians : the force of popular culture and ICT in early learning|website=Maynooth University LibrarySearch|date=December 1, 2011|accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fh6xn3yd3x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=The+science+of+Star+Wars:+Integrating+technology+and+the+Benchmarks+for+Science+Literacy&amp;rft.jtitle=Science+Scope&amp;rft.au=Thompson,+Stephanie&amp;rft.date=2006-11-01&amp;rft.pub=National+Science+Teachers+Association&amp;rft.issn=0887-2376&amp;rft.eissn=1943-4901&amp;rft.spage=55&amp;rft.externalDBID=IAO&amp;rft.externalDocID=157773264&amp;paramdict=en-US|title=The science of Star Wars: Integrating technology and the Benchmarks for Science Literacy|website=Maynooth University LibrarySearch|date=November 1, 2006|accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the US have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Susan Hatters|last2=Hall|first2=Ryan C.

Tamil culture is rooted in the arts and ways of life of Tamils in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and across the globe.  Tamil culture is expressed in [[language]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[theatre]], [[folk arts]], [[martial arts]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[sports]], [[Mass media|media]], [[comedy]], [[cuisine]], [[costumes]], [[Festival|celebration]]s, [[philosophy]], [[religion]]s, [[tradition]]s, [[ritual]]s, [[organization]]s, [[science]], and [[technology]].

Tamils have strong attachment to the Tamil language, which is often venerated in literature as "''Tamil̲an̲n̲ai''", "the Tamil mother".&lt;ref&gt;See Sumathi Ramasamy, ''Passions of the Tongue'', 'Feminising language: Tamil as Goddess, Mother, Maiden' Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has historically been, and to large extent still is, central to the Tamil identity.&lt;ref&gt;(Ramaswamy 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other languages of [[South India]], it is a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]], unrelated to the [[Indo-European languages]] of northern India. The Tamil language preserves many features of [[Proto-Dravidian]], though modern-day spoken Tamil in Tamil Nadu freely uses [[loanword]]s from Sanskrit and English and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Kailasapathy | first=K.| title=The Tamil Purist Movement: A Re-Evaluation | journal=Social Scientist | volume=7 | issue=10 | year=1979 | pages=23–51| doi=10.2307/3516775 | publisher=Social Scientist | jstor=3516775}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tamil literature]] is of considerable antiquity, and is recognised as a [[classical language]] by the [[government of India]]. [[Sangam literature|Classical Tamil literature]], which ranges from [[lyric poetry]] to works on [[poetics]] and [[ethics|ethical philosophy]], is remarkably different from contemporary and later literature in other Indian languages, and represents the oldest body of secular literature in South-east Asia.&lt;ref&gt;See Hart, ''The Poems of Ancient Tamil: Their Milieu and their Sanskrit Counterpart'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Tamil grammatical works [[Tolkappiyam]], the ten anthologies [[Pattuppāṭṭu]], the eight anthologies [[Eṭṭuttokai]] sheds light on early religion of ancient Dravidian people. ''[[Murugan]]'' was glorified as, ''the god of war, who is ever young and resplendent,'' as ''the favored god of the Tamils.''&lt;ref name="Kanchan Sinha 1979"&gt;Kanchan Sinha, Kartikeya in Indian art and literature, Delhi: Sundeep Prakashan (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;       [[Shiva|Sivan]] was also seen as the supreme God.&lt;ref name="Kanchan Sinha 1979"/&gt; Early iconography of [[Murugan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahadevan|first=Iravatham|title=A Note on the Muruku Sign of the Indus Script in light of the Mayiladuthurai Stone Axe Discovery|year=2006|publisher=harappa.com|url=http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904034700/http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html|archivedate=2006-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shiva|Sivan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of India: A Historical Survey| author = Ranbir Vohra| publisher = M.E.

[[Tolkappiyam]], mentions that each of these ''thinai'' had an associated deity such [[Murugan|Seyyon]] in ''Kurinji''-the hills, [[Vishnu|Thirumaal]] in ''Mullai''-the forests,  and [[Indra|Venthan]] in ''Marutham''-the plains,

The most important Tamil festivals are [[Pongal]], a [[harvest festival]] that occurs in mid-January, and Varudapirappu, the Tamil New Year, which occurs on 14 April. Both are celebrated by almost all Tamils, regardless of religion. The [[Hindu]] festival [[Diwali|Deepavali]] is celebrated with fanfare; other local [[Hindu]] festivals include [[Thaipusam]], Panguni Uttiram, and [[Adiperukku]]. While Adiperukku is celebrated with more pomp in the Cauvery region than in others, the Ayyavazhi Festival, [[Ayya Vaikunda Avataram]], is predominantly celebrated in the southern districts of [[Kanyakumari District]], [[Tirunelveli]], and [[Thoothukudi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006030305790400.htm&amp;date=2006/03/03/&amp;prd=th&amp; Information on declaration of holiday on the event of birth anniversary of Vaikundar in ''The Hindu''], The holiday for three Districts:  ''Daily Thanthi'', Daily''(Tamil)'', Nagercoil Edition, 5 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Saivism|Saivist]] sect of Hinduism is significantly represented amongst Tamils, more so among Sri Lankan Tamils, although most of the Saivist places of religious significance are in [[North India|northern India]]. The [[Alvars]] and [[Nayanars]], who were predominantly Tamils, played a key role in the renaissance of [[Bhakti]] tradition in India. In the 10th century, the philosopher [[Ramanuja]], who propagated the theory of [[Vishishtadvaita|Visishtadvaitam]], brought many changes to worshiping practices, creating new regulations on temple worship, and accepted lower-caste Hindus as his prime disciples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Redefining secularism |author= | work=The Hindu, 18 March 2004 | url= http://www.hindu.com/2004/03/18/stories/2004031801941000.htm | accessdate=5 December 2006 | location=Chennai, India | date=18 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Martial Traditions ==
Various martial arts including [[Kuttu Varisai]], [[Varma Kalai]], [[Silambam]], [[Adithada]], [[Malla-yuddha|Malyutham]] and [[Kalarippayattu]], are practised in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;Zarrilli, Phillip B. (1992) "[http://www.spa.ex.ac.uk/drama/staff/kalari/healharm.html To Heal and/or To Harm: The Vital Spots in Two South Indian Martial Traditions]"&lt;/ref&gt; The warm-up phase includes [[yoga]], meditation and breathing exercises. Silambam originated in ancient [[Tamilakam]] and was patronized by the Pandyans, Cholas and Cheras, who ruled over this region. ''Silapathiharam'' a Tamil literature from the 2nd century AD, refers to the sale of Silamabam instructions, weapons and equipment to foreign traders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.indiapress.org/silambam.php/SPORTS IN INDIA]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early [[Sangam age]], there was a warlike culture in South India. War was regarded as an honorable sacrifice and fallen heroes and kings were worshiped in the form of a [[Hero stone]]. Each warrior was trained in martial arts, horse riding and specialized in two of the weapons of that period Vel (spear) Val (sword) and Vil (bow).&lt;ref&gt;South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka(2003), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; Heroic [[martyrdom]] was glorified in ancient Tamil literature. The Tamil kings and warriors followed an honour code similar to that of Japanese [[Samurai]]s and committed suicide to save the honor. The forms of martial suicide were known as Avipalli, Thannai, Verttal, Marakkanchi, [[Vatakkiruttal]] and Punkilithu Mudiyum Maram. Avipalli was mentioned in all the works except ''Veera Soliyam''. It was a self-sacrifice of a warrior to the goddess of war for the victory of his commander. The [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|Tamil rebels]] in [[Sri Lanka]] reflected some elements of Tamil martial traditions which included worship of fallen heroes ([[Maaveerar Naal]]) and practice of martial suicide. They carried a [[Suicide pill]] around their neck to escape the captivity and torture.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Lankan Ethnic Crisis: Towards a Resolution (2002), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; A remarkable feature besides to their willingness to sacrifice is, that they were well organized and disciplined. It was forbidden for the rebels to consume [[tobacco]]s, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]s, [[drug]]s and to have sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Modern Worldwide Extremists and Extremist Groups, p.252.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Tamil [[folk dance]]s is ''[[karakattam]]''. In its religious form, the dance is performed in front of an image of the goddess [[Mariamma]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Manorama (2004). Folk India: A Comprehensive Study of Indian Folk Music and Culture, Vol. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kuravanci'' is a type of dance-drama, performed by four to eight women. The drama is opened by a woman playing the part of a female [[Fortune-telling|soothsayer]] of the ''[[kurava]]'' tribe(people of hills and mountains), who tells the story of a lady pining for her lover. The [[Koothu|therukoothu]], literally meaning "street play", is a form of village theater or folk opera. It is traditionally performed in village squares, with no sets and very simple props.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tamilnadu.com/arts/therukoothu.html|title=Therukoothu|publisher=Tamilnadu.com|date=16 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619060246/http://tamilnadu.com/arts/therukoothu.html|archivedate=19 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performances involve songs and dances, and the stories can be either religious or [[secularity|secular]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=Tamil Art History| author=| work=| url=http://www.eelavar.com/jaffna/pageview.php?ID=578&amp;SID=119| publisher=eelavar.com| accessdate=5 December 2006| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427073449/http://www.eelavar.com/jaffna/pageview.php?ID=578&amp;SID=119| archivedate=27 April 2006| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performances are not formal, and performers often interact with the audience, mocking them, or involving them in the dialogue.

=== Film and theater arts ===
{{main|Tamil cinema|Tamil television soap opera |Kattaikkuttu}}
The theatrical culture that flourished Tamil culture during the classical age. Tamil theatre has a long and varied history whose origins can be traced back almost two millennia to dance-theatre forms like ''Kotukotti'' and ''Pandarangam'', which are mentioned in an ancient anthology of poems entitled the ''Kalingathu Parani''.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Kennedy  "The Oxford Encyclopedia of Theatre and Performance, Publisher:Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant theater form of the region is [[Kattaikkuttu]], where performers (historically men) sing, act, dance and are accompanied by musicians on traditional instruments. The majority of performances draw from stories in the [[Mahabharata]], while a few plays take their inspiration from [[Purana]] stories.

The modern Tamil film industry originated during the 20th century. Tamil film industry has its headquarters in Chennai and is known under the name [[Kollywood]], it is the second largest film industry in India after [[Bollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The states they're in  |author= | work= Guardian, 26 November 2006 | url= http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,1955127,00.html|publisher= guardian.com | accessdate=5 December 2006 | location=London | first=Tom | last=Templeton | date=26 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films from Kollywood entertain audiences not only in India but also overseas [[Tamil diaspora]].

Several Tamil actresses such as Anuisa Ranjan [[Vyjayanthimala]], [[Hema Malini]], [[Rekha Ganesan]], [[Sridevi]], [[Meenakshi Sheshadri]], and [[Vidya Balan]] have acted in [[Bollywood]] and dominated the cinema over the years. Some Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu like [[MG Ramachandran]], [[Karunanidhi]] and [[Jayalalithaa]] have their background in Tamil film industry.

=== Jallikattu ===
{{Further|Jallikattu|2017 Jallikattu protests}}
In Ancient times, two bullfighting and bull-racing sports were conducted. 1.Manjuvirattu and 2. Yeruthazhuval.  These sports were organised to keep the people's temperament always fit and ready for the war at any time. Each has its own techniques and rules. These sports acted as one of the criteria to marry girls of warrior family. There were traditions where the winner would be chosen as bridegroom for their daughter or sister.

Mr. Gandhirajan, who is a post-graduate in Art History from Madurai-Kamaraj University, said the ancient Tamil tradition was "manju virattu" (chasing bulls) or "eruthu kattuthal" (lassoing bulls) and it was never "jallikattu," that is baiting a bull or controlling it as the custom obtained today. In ancient Tamil country, during the harvest festival, decorated bulls would be let loose on the "peru vazhi" (highway) and the village youth would take pride in chasing them and outrunning them. Women, elders and children would watch the fun from the sidelines of the "peru vazhi" or streets. Nobody was injured in this. Or the village youth would take delight in lassoing the sprinting bulls with "vadam" (rope).

It was about 500 years ago, after the advent of the Nayak rule in Tamil Nadu with its Telugu rulers and chieftains, that this harmless bull-chasing sport metamorphosed into "jallikattu," said Mr. Gandhirajan.

{{Tamils}}
The '''Tamil diaspora''' refers to descendants of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Emigration|immigrants]] who emigrated from their native lands to other parts of the world. They are found primarily in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]], [[Réunion]], [[Mauritius]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], and parts of the [[Caribbean]], South America (Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana) 

==Early migrations==
{{Main|Sri Lankan Tamils|Sri Lankan Chetties|Chitty|Bharatha people|Thigala|Hebbar Iyengar|Kaikadi people{{!}}Kaikadi}}

Many of Tamil [[emigrants]] who left shores of Tamil Nadu before 18th Century and mixed with countless other ethnicities. In medieval period Tamilians emigrated as soldiers, traders  and labourers settled in Kerala (specially Palakkad), Karnataka, Maharashtra, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and intermixed well with local population, while few communities still maintain their language and culture. Many groups still claim descent from [[medieval]]-era Tamil emigrants such as the [[Thigala]]s, [[Hebbar]]s of Karnataka who have resided in Karnataka for generations have even adopted Kannada as their mother tongue, [[Kaikadi people|Kaikadis]] of Maharashtra, [[Chitty]]s of [[Malaysia]] and the [[Sri Lankan Chetties]], [[Bharatha people]], some section of the [[Sri Lankan Tamil]]s of [[Sri Lanka]].

An early emigrant group that is not well documented is the [[Tamil Muslim]]s who emigrated in considerable numbers to the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] (in present-day [[Malaysia]]) and were instrumental in spreading Islam amongst the indigenous [[Malays people|Malays]]. Some are descended from immigrants from land of Arabia (Middle East), though it is not known which part of the Arab world they are from.

==British, French, and Dutch indentured workers and others==
{{Main|Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Tamil Malaysians|Tamil South Africans|Tamil Mauritian}}
[[File:Kalamandapam.jpg|right|thumb|230px|[[Sri Kandaswamy Kovil, Brickfields|Sri Kandaswamy Temple]], [[Brickfields]], Malaysia.]]

During this period British, Dutch, French, Portuguese and Danish colony administrators recruited a lot of local Tamilians and took them to their overseas colonies to work as laborers, petty administration officers, clerical and military duties.

In the 19th century, Madras Presidency (of which the Tamil Nadu region was a core part of) faced brutal famines. Great Famine of 1876–78. Tamil Nadu was both politically and economically weak. Britishers thus made use of hungry Tamil workers for their plantations all over the world - Malaysia, Singapore, Myanmar, Mauritius, [[Tamil South Africans|South Africa]], Fiji and also Sri Lanka (distinct from the Tamils who migrated to [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] before 18th century). Some of the Tamil groups (especially Chettiyars, Pillais, Muslims) emigrated as commercial migrants. These groups then dominated the trade and finance in Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, South Africa and other places. The first Indian to own a merchant ship during the British times comes from this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raghuram|first1=Parvati|last2=Sahoo|first2=Ajaya Kumar|last3=Maharaj|first3=Brij|last4=Sangha|first4=Dave|title=Tracing an Indian Diaspora: Contexts, Memories, Representations|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=fraGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Madrasi+diaspora&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U7PK4qsZOo&amp;sig=_MIhJvpFnTBm-0uasi6-zBdqOCQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih6bn0ldPQAhUHxYMKHbZbD7IQ6AEIMDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Madrasi%20diaspora&amp;f=false|publisher=SAGE Publications India|language=en|date=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These Tamilians well integrated, assimilated with their adopted countries, and became part and parcel of local populations in Mauritius, South Africa, Guyana, and Fiji. Where as [[Tamils in Bangalore|Karnataka Tamils]] of Karnataka, [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka]] of Sri Lanka, and [[Tamil Malaysians]] of Malaysia were evolved into distinct communities of their own with unique multilingual sub-culture and identity.

Many also left to work in the possessions of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] via its holdings in [[Pondicherry district|Pondichéry]] in [[Réunion]] and the French Caribbean islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] (See [[Malabars]]). A small group was hired by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonial government in [[Dutch East Indies]] (present-day Indonesia) to work in [[Sumatra]] (namely in [[Medan]]). Roughly about 40,000 (est) descendants of these immigrants are still found in [[Medan]].

Many independent Tamil merchant guilds such as the [[Nagarathar]] also left for these areas in an age old tradition of their ancestors who had traded in these areas for the last 2,000 years. Britain also hired many Sri Lankan Tamils as clerical and other white collar workers, especially in Malaysia and Singapore. All these different streams have combined to create vibrant Tamil communities in these countries.

Also many [[Tamil people|Tamils]] from India and Sri Lanka migrated to [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Crown colony of Singapore]] and [[British Malaya]] as labours, army clerks and merchants.

==Twentieth century==
===Return Migration from Sri Lanka and Burma===
During and after the devastating [[World War II|WW2]] a large number of Tamils and other Indians from Burma fled to India- to [[Manipur]],&lt;ref name="Manipur"&gt;[http://www.webindia123.com/manipur/people/otherpeople2.htm Manipur - The People], webindia123.com&lt;/ref&gt; and Tamil Nadu. They established Burmese refugee colonies that still exist today and maintain an identity as Burmese returnees. In Sri Lanka the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] nationalist [[SLFP]] party disfranchised all Indian origin [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka]] and returned 600,000 back to India under the [[Srimavo-Shastri Pact]] signed between India and Sri Lanka. Many were repatriated to the [[Nilgiris (mountains)|Nilgiris]] region's tea estates. They too maintain a distinct identity as [[Ceylon]] returnees in Tamil Nadu. [[Black July]] has created another stream of Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka refugees in India who have languished for the last 20 years in refugee camps throughout Tamil Nadu while many others have integrated with the mainstream community or left India for other countries in the west.

There is also a movement of native Sri Lankan Tamils to India; some migrated to do white-collar jobs during the British days, but there has been a much bigger diaspora today.

===Post-1983 dispersal of Sri Lankan Tamils===
The [[Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora]] is less than 100 years old and was well established in Malaysia, Singapore and England prior to the post 1983 [[Black July]] induced dispersal of refugees and asylum claimants in India, [[Europe]], and [[Canada]]. Although relatively recent in origin, this subgroup had well-established communities in these host countries prior to the 1983 [[pogroms]]. A more recent Sri Lankan Tamil community has developed rapidly in the [[United States]].

===20th century dispersal of Tamils from India===

{{Main|South Indian Tamil diaspora|Tamil Muslim}}

In the second half of the 20th century, Tamils from India migrated as skilled professionals to various parts of India and countries like UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UK, USA, Singapore and so on. Some of them got citizenship of respective countries but still having strong family and cultural ties with Tamil Nadu, than those who migrated before 1950, who lost touch with their ancestral links in Tamil Nadu.

==By Region==
===Africa===
====Mainland Africa====
With reference to Mainland Africa, There is a significant amount of Tamils in Africa, Especially Kenya. Kenya holds at least 30% of the Tamilians in the Country followed by Uganda. Most of these people are Migrants while some of them have been living there for generations.

[[Mauritius]] has a Tamil population of 115,000. Most arrived from Tamil Nadu after 1727 to serve as labourers on the sugar cane plantations.&lt;ref name=Sivasupramaniam/&gt; Tamil culture has flourished in Mauritius. Since 1727, the Tamil community has built almost 125 Tamil temples and [[Murugan]] is a popular deity.

The Tamil language is taught in approximately 100 primary schools. Tamils are attempting to include their religion and other Hindu practices. Once Tamil priests came from Jaffna in [[Sri Lanka]], they conducted prayers in Tamil. Later, some scholars started to facilitate the population to get access to sacred books. This helped the people to learn Tamil holy Enchantment from [[Thevaram]]s and [[Thiruvasagam]]&lt;ref name=Sivasupramaniam/&gt;

=====Burma=====
[[Burma]] had a Tamil population of 200,000 at one point in the country's history but since the end of the [[Second World War]] the number has fallen.&lt;ref name=Sivasupramaniam/&gt; The affluence of the Tamil community could be gauged by the existence of Dandayuthapani temples in 32 towns, the functioning of 50 Tamil primary schools, and the circulation of two Tamil newspapers, "Rasika Ranjani" and "Thondan", both of which were banned as of 1966.

=====Indonesia=====
{{Main|Tamil Indonesians}}
Tamils were brought to [[Indonesia]] by the Dutch in the 1860s to build up their plantations. They were used as hard labor, and as the conditions were not conducive many returned in the 1940s.

'''Taruma''' (''Taruamá'') is a divergent language of northeastern Brazil. It has been reported to be extinct several times since as far back as 1770, but Eithne Carlin discovered the last speakers, and is documenting the language.  It would seem that "Saluma" is the same language.

Taruma is unclassified.&lt;ref name="Carlin" /&gt;  It has been proposed to be distantly related to [[Katembri language|Katembri]] (Kaufman 1990), but this relationship has not been repeated in recent surveys of South American languages (Campbell &amp; Grondona 2012).

'''Thero Lavon Wheeler''' (1945–2009) was one of the founding members of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]].

==Early life==

Wheeler was born in [[Schulenburg, Texas]], on January 28, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Rieterman, T, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?%20nid=1298&amp;dat=19760107&amp;id=TuJNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XYsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7366,650988&amp;hl=en ''They thought he was a kidnaper''], ''The Free Lance Star'' Jan 7, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fbimostwanted.us/zc/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=0&amp;products_id=1046&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Ethel Mae Anderson and his father was John Henry Wheeler. He grew up in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Fillmore District, San Francisco|Filmore]] and [[Western Addition, San Francisco|Western Addition]]&lt;ref&gt;Free Lance Star, op cit.&lt;/ref&gt; areas, and had two brothers, one a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;People Magazine, op cit&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment and radicalization==

He was convicted of assault and robbery at age 17.&lt;ref&gt;The Free Lance Star, op cit&lt;/ref&gt;

He was serving a one-year-to-life sentence. In prison, he began studying politics. A convict organizer, he was known as a "jailhouse lawyer." He read Engels, Marx and Lenin. He had joined and then, with critiques, resigned from [[the Black Panthers]] and a Maoist group. Wheeler met some activists from [[University of California, Berkeley]] while he was in [[California Medical Facility|Vacaville prison]]. Through this group, he met his girlfriend at that time, a young heiress&lt;ref&gt;Burrough, Bryan, "Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI and the forgotten age of Revolutionary Violence", Penguin, 2015, p&lt;/ref&gt; who went by the name of [[Mary Alice Siem]].

==Escape==
In August 1973, the early SLA clique apparently engineered the escape of Thero Wheeler, providing transportation and a change of clothes after Wheeler walked away from Vacaville prison. Wheeler later said his friends who aided his escape were "well-connected".&lt;ref&gt;Rieterman, T, "They thought he was a kidnaper", "The Free Lance Star" Jan 7, 1976 https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19760107&amp;id=TuJNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XYsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7366,650988&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; He joined DeFreeze and "a curious group of upper middle-class whites, most college-educated but menially employed" at a small house&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, Vin, "The Man and the Mystery behind the Sla terror", People Magazine, April 29, 1974, http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20063998,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. Curiously, there appeared to be no manhunt by the authorities for Wheeler after his escape.

Close friends say he split with the SLA over the Foster murder, under death threat after he called DeFreeze a "drunken fool."&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, Vin, "The Man and the Mystery behind the Sla terror", People Magazine, April 29, 1974, http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20063998,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May 1974, an [https://www.newspapers.com/image/39202550 article] appeared in [[The Pittsburgh Courier]] quoting Mary Alice Siem. She had originally spoken to [[The San Francisco Examiner]]. She said that she had left the SLA due to death threats from DeFreeze:

:Mary Alice Siem, 24, Redding, Calif., told authorities she and Thero Wheeler, 29, unofficially identified two months ago as a possible suspect in the Hearst kidnaping, left the terrorist organization last October because they disagreed with the SLA's violent tactics.
:Miss Siem ... said she and Wheeler, who were living together, attended about 20 SLA meetings. ...
:On one occasion she said she was threatened at gunpoint by DeFreeze, Miss Soltysik, and Miss Perry, but Wheeler intervened. When they left the SLA, she said she and Wheeler were robbed of $600 by the other members.
:According to the examiner, whose president and editor is Miss Hearst's father, Miss Siem told authorities that she and Wheeler left the SLA because Wheeler was opposed to the violence espoused by DeFreeze.
:She said their departure took place in October, a month before the fatal shooting of Oakland Schools Superintendent [[Marcus Foster]], for which the SLA claims responsibility, and four months before Miss Hearst was kidnaped.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/39202550/ "Woman quits SLA over death threat"], [[The Pittsburgh Courier]], May 4, 1974, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are some discrepancies.

After [[Patty Hearst]] was kidnapped, a number of eyewitnesses contributed to [[identikit]] composite sketches of the men they had seen. The drawings both appeared to resemble DeFreeze and Wheeler so closely that police were soon able to attach names to these sketches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/39202550/ "Woman quits SLA over death threat"], [[The Pittsburgh Courier]], May 4, 1974, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Wheeler moved to Texas and changed his name to Bradley Bruce. He relied on electronics skills learned in prison to gain employment. He formed a relationship with a woman and they had a daughter. His cover was blown while interceding in a dispute. When he sought hospital treatment, his alias was fed into a computer and the FBI arrested him. He was returned to California to face escape charges and continue serving his previous term.&lt;ref&gt;Rieterman, T, "They thought he was a kidnaper", "The Free Lance Star" Jan 7, 1976 https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19760107&amp;id=TuJNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XYsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7366,650988&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 he married Cynthia Spencer.

Wheeler appeared in some 2005 San Francisco local newspapers as a recipient of free eyeglasses through a program known as Project Connect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fogcityjournal.com/local/project_connect.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; In those articles, Wheeler was described as a [[Vietnam War]] veteran.

==Death==
Wheeler died on March 2, 2009, in San Francisco.

The '''Wazirs''' or '''Waziris''' ({{lang-ps|وزير}}) are a [[Karlani]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribe found mainly in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region of North and South Waziristan. The [[Utmanzai (tribe)|Utmanzai]] are settled in the [[North Waziristan Agency]] and the [[Ahmadzai (Wazir clan)|Ahmadzai]] are in the [[South Waziristan Agency]].&lt;ref name="npgs"&gt;{{cite document |publisher=Naval Postgraduate School |title=Tribe: Ahmadzai Wazir |url=http://www.nps.edu/programs/ccs/Docs/Pakistan/Tribes/Ahmadzai_Wazir.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pakistan |first=Syed Farooq |last=Hasnat |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2011 |isbn=9780313346972 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yeqwIs_NoTEC&amp;pg=PA164 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Most Dangerous Place: Pakistan's Lawless Frontier |first=Imtiaz |last=Gul |publisher=Penguin UK |year=2010 |isbn=9780141962986 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MU3VUC1qeLYC&amp;pg=PT87 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those subgroups are in turn divided further, for example into Utmanzai tribes such as the Baka Khel and Jani Khel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A British Tale of Indian and Foreign Service: The Memoirs of Sir Ian Scott |first=Ian |last=Scott |editor-first=Denis |editor-last=Judd |publisher=The Radcliffe Press |year=1999 |isbn=9781860643804 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynErxAOIz9gC&amp;pg=PA71 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wazirs speak the [[Waziristani dialect]] of [[Pashto]].

The common ancestor of the Ahmadzai and Utmanzai is believed by them to be the eponymous Wazir, who is also ancestor to the [[Mehsud]] tribe that has since taken a distinct and divergent path. Through Wazir, the tribes trace their origins to [[Karlani]] and thence to the founder of the Pashtun lineage, [[Qais Abdur Rashid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Thistle and the Drone: How America's War on Terror Became a Global War on Tribal Islam |first=Akbar |last=Ahmed |authorlink=Akbar Ahmed |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780815723790 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_YMKlVfFLkC&amp;pg=PT66 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some western [[ethnology|ethnologists]] consider them of being mix of [[Arachosia]]n or [[Tatar]] ethnicity.&lt;ref name="npgs" /&gt;
