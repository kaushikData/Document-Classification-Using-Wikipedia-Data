      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2544">The '''Ainu creation myths''' are the traditional [[creation myth|creation accounts]] of the [[Ainu people]]s of Japan.  Their stories share common characteristics with [[Japanese creation myth]]s and [[Earth_diver#Earth-diver|earth diver]] creation stories commonly found in Central Asian and Native American cultures.&lt;ref name="ainuleeming"/&gt;  In one version the [[creator deity]] sends down a [[wagtail|water wagtail]] to create habitable land in the watery world below. The little bird fluttered over the waters, splashing water aside and then he packed patches of the earth firm by stomping them with his feet and beating them with his tail.  In this way [[island]]s where the Ainu were later to live were raised to float upon the [[ocean]].&lt;ref name="ainuleeming"&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|2009}} - [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t279.e3 "Ainu Creation"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sproul|1979|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Ainu tend to be somewhat [[hirsutism|hirsute]], at least in comparison to other [[East Asia]]n populations, many Ainu stories maintain that their first ancestor was a bear.  However, an alternative version tells of Kamuy sending a heavenly couple to earth called Okikurumi and Turesh.  This couple had a son, whom some consider the first Ainu, and he is believed to have given the people the necessary skills to survive.&lt;ref name="ainuleeming"/&gt;

[[English people|English]] missionary [[John Batchelor (missionary)|John Batchelor]] related a myth the Ainu told him wherein before God created the world, there was only a vast swamp in which lived a large trout, and the creator placed the world upon the trout, so that the fish sucks in and spits out water from the sea, causing the [[tides]].&lt;ref name="Batchelor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batchelor|first1=John|title=The Ainu and their folk-lore|date=1901|publisher=The Religious Tract Society|location=London|page=52|url=https://archive.org/stream/ainuandtheirfol00batcgoog#page/n84/mode/2up/search/round|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andre Gunder Frank''' (February 24, 1929 &amp;ndash; April 23, 2005) was a German-American economic historian and sociologist who promoted [[dependency theory]] after 1970 and [[world-systems theory]] after 1984. He employed some [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] concepts on [[political economy]], but rejected [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s [[stages of history]], and [[economic history]] generally.

==Biography==
Frank was born in [[Weimar Germany|Germany]] to Jewish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Andre "Gunder" Frank (1929–2005)|first=Sidney|last=Mintz|date=1 March 2007|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=109|issue=1|pages=232–234|doi=10.1525/aa.2007.109.1.232}}&lt;/ref&gt; parents, pacifist writer [[Leonhard Frank]] and his second wife Elena Maqenne Penswehr, but his family fled the country when [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed Chancellor. Frank received schooling in several places in [[Switzerland]], where his family settled, until they emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1941. Frank's undergraduate studies were at [[Swarthmore College]]. He earned his [[Ph.D.]] in [[economics]] in 1957 at the [[University of Chicago]]. His doctorate was a study of Soviet agriculture entitled ''Growth and Productivity in Ukrainian Agriculture from 1928 to 1955''. Ironically, his dissertation supervisor was [[Milton Friedman]], a man whose [[laissez faire]] approach to economics Frank would later harshly criticize.

Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s Frank taught at American universities. In 1962 he moved to [[Latin America]], inaugurating a remarkable period of travel that confirmed his peripatetic tendencies. His most notable work during this time was his stint as Professor of Sociology and Economics at the [[University of Chile]], where he was involved in reforms under the government of [[Salvador Allende]]. After Allende's government was toppled by a [[1973 coup in Chile|coup d'état in 1973]], Frank fled to Europe, where he occupied a series of university positions. From 1981 until his retirement in 1994 he was professor in developmental economy at the [[University of Amsterdam]].

He was married to [[Marta Fuentes]], with whom he wrote several studies about social movements, and with Marta he had two sons. Marta died in Amsterdam in June 1993. His second wife was sociologist Nancy Howell, a friend for forty years: while married to her, they lived in [[Toronto]]. Frank died in 2005 of complications related to his cancer while under the care of his third wife, Alison Candela.

==Works and ideas==
During his career, Frank taught and did research in departments of anthropology, economics, geography, history, international relations, political science, and sociology. He worked at nine universities in North America, three in Latin America, and five in Europe. He gave countless lectures and seminars at dozens of universities and other institutions all around the world in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German and Dutch. Frank wrote widely on the economic, social and political history and contemporary development of the world system, the industrially developed countries, and especially of the [[Third World]] and Latin America. He produced over 1,000 publications in 30 languages. His last major article, "East and West", appeared in the volume: "Dar al Islam. The Mediterranean, the World System and the Wider Europe: The "Cultural Enlargement" of the EU and Europe's Identity" edited by [[Peter Herrmann (sociologist)|Peter Herrmann]] ([[University College Cork]]) and [[Arno Tausch]] ([[Innsbruck University]]), published by [[Nova Science Publishers]], New York.

His work in the 1990s focused on world history. He returned to his analysis of global political economy in the new millennium inspired by a lecture he gave at the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga (SSE Riga). In 2006 SSE Riga received Andre Gunder Frank's personal library collection and set-up the Andre Gunder Frank Memorial Library in his honor, with the support of the [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]].

Frank was a prolific author, writing 40 books. He published widely on political economy, economic history, international relations, historical sociology, and world history. Perhaps his most notable work is ''Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America.'' Published in 1967, it was one of the formative texts in dependency theory. In his later career he produced works such as ''ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age'' and, with Barry Gills, ''The World System: Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand''. Frank's theories center on the idea that a nation's economic strength, largely determined by historical circumstances—especially geography—dictates its global power. He is also well known for suggesting that purely export oriented solutions to development create imbalances detrimental to poor countries. Frank has made significant contributions to the [[world-systems theory]] (which, according to him, should be rather called the World System one). He has argued that a World System was formed no later than in the [[4th millennium BC]]; his argument contrasts sharply with the scholarly majority who posit beginnings in the "long 16th century" (a position held, for example, by [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]). Frank also insisted that the idea of numerous "world-systems" did not make much sense (indeed, if there are many "world-systems" in the world, then they simply do not deserve to be called "world-systems"), and we should rather speak about one single World System.

Andre Gunder Frank and Professor [[David Landes]], author of ''[[The Wealth and Poverty of Nations]]'', are noted for having come to very different conclusions about the long view significance of economic developments in "the West" during the modern era and publicly debated their findings in 1998 at Northeastern University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/116051-1 "Economic History Debate,"] ''Northeastern University, World History Center'' (Dec 2, 1998). Retrieved 26 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his last essays,&lt;ref&gt;EAST AND WEST in [[Arno Tausch]] and Peter Herrmann, 2005,'Dar al Islam. The Mediterranean, the World System and the Wider Europe. Vol. 1: The "Cultural Enlargement" of the EU and Europe's Identity' Hauppauge, New York: Nova Science Publishers. Abridged paperback ed., 2006, titled: “The West, Europe and the Muslim World”&lt;/ref&gt; Frank made arguments about the looming [[global economic crisis of 2008]].{{Clarification needed|date=August 2016|reason=It needs to be made clearer what he actually said and how that relates to the GFC. The initial version of this sentence was given its own "Prediction" section (just for the one sentence) and said "argued prophetically", so it seems there may be a POV issue here.}}

'''André Antoine''' (31 January 1858{{snd}}23 October 1943) was a [[French actor]], [[Actor-manager|theatre manager]], [[film director]], author, and critic who is considered the father of modern [[mise en scène]] in France.

==Biography==
'''André Antoine''' was a clerk at the Paris Gas Utility and worked in the Archer Theatre when he asked to produce a dramatization of a novel by [[Émile Zola]]. The amateur group refused it, so he decided to create his own theatre to realize his vision of the proper development of dramatic art.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Antoine founded the [[Théâtre Libre]] in [[Paris]] in 1887. This was a ''théâtre d'essai'', a workshop theatre, where plays were produced whether they would perform at the box office or not. It was also a stage for new writing whose subject matter or form had been rejected in other theatres. Over a seven-year period, until 1894, the Théâtre Libre staged some 111 plays. His work had enormous influence on the French stage,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} as well as on similar companies elsewhere in Europe, such as the [[Independent Theatre Society]] in [[London]] and the Freie Buhne in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitter and Shevtsova (2005, 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoine opposed the traditional teachings of the [[Paris Conservatory]], and focused on a more naturalistic style of acting and staging. In particular, Théâtre Libre productions were inspired by the [[Meiningen Ensemble]] of Germany. They performed works by Zola, [[Henry Becque|Becque]], [[Brieux]], and plays by contemporary German, Scandinavian, and Russian naturalists.  In 1894, Antoine was forced to relinquish the theater due to financial failure, but he went on to form [[Théâtre Antoine]], which followed the traditions established by Théâtre Libre until its demise 10 years later.

The work of the Theatre Libre was said to embrace both Realism and Naturalism. In theatre, Realism is generally thought to be a 19th-century movement which uses dramatic and stylistic conventions to bring authenticity and 'real life' to performances and drama texts while Naturalism is commonly seen as an extension to this where an attempt is made to create a perfect illusion of reality. Naturalism is often said to be driven by Darwinism and its view of humans as behavioral creatures shaped by heredity and environment. Antoine believed that our environment determines our character and he would often start rehearsals by creating the set, settings or environment which would then allow his actors to explore their characters and their behaviors with greater authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley (1995, 8)&lt;/ref&gt; Often he would only hire untrained actors (a practice still common with young film makers) since he believed that the professional actors of his time could not realistically portray real people.

Antoine's Theatre Libre dedicated itself more specifically to the Quart d'heure or short, simple, free, episodic, one act play performances. he concentrated on script development but advocated naturalistic, behavioral acting dependent on the interaction of actors and helping acting to find their psychological motivations. Discussions on matters of interpretation and setting were a normal part of rehearsals with actors.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley (1995, 8)&lt;/ref&gt; Antoine believed each play had its unique mood or atmosphere and he hardly ever reused sets and settings. He also literally believed in the notion of removing the fourth wall. With some plays he would rehearse in the space with four walls around the action, natural set and actors and then decide which fourth wall to remove and thus deciding which side or perspective to place the audience on. Plays performed at the Théâtre Libre were often "thin on plot, dense in social and psychological implication" (Chothia, Andre Antoine). Productions rejected formal acting styles that were prevalent at the time and they built the "[[fourth wall]]."  Despite being proponents of naturalism, they still adhered to some ideas of "playing for the audience" – there is no evidence{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} that Antoine ever set any chairs facing away from the audience, and the actors still had to make sure that their voices could be heard to the back of the house—so, in a way, their "naturalism" was really just a higher level of illusion than theatre had been up to that point.

In 1894, Antoine gave up the direction of his own theatre, and became connected with the Gymnase, and two years later, with the Odéon theatres.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Antoine, André|volume=2|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily indebted, he left the Odéon in 1914 and turned to the [[Film|cinema]]. Meanwhile, he stayed a short period in Istanbul in order to found The Istanbul City Theater. Once World War I started he returned to Paris. Between 1915 and 1922, he directed several films under auspices of the ''Société cinématographique des auteurs et gens de lettres'' ("Film Society of Authors and Men of Letters") of [[Pierre Decourcelle]], adapting literary or dramatic works, such as ''La Terre'' ("Earth"), ''Les Frères corses'' ("The Corsican Brothers") and ''Quatre-vingt-treize'' ("Ninety-three"). He applied the principles of naturalism to film, giving importance to the scenery, natural elements that actually determine the behavior of the protagonists, and by using non-professional actors who were not tied up in the old forms of theater. For Jean Tulard, his literary reputation and is involved in "giving the film its sense of nobility". Influencing film makers like Mercanton, Capellans Hervil and he is "the true father of neorealism".

Antoine concluded his career as a theatre and [[film critic]] beginning in 1919. For twenty years, his commentary was published by ''L'Information'', and more sporadically in ''Le Journal, Comœdia'', and ''Le Monde illustré''. Two volumes of memoirs were published in 1928, and appeared in the journal ''Théâtre'' from 1932 to 1933.

==Alternate definition==

===FM 100.5===
'''BC''' is defined as the art of [[battle]] decision-making, leading, and motivating [[soldier]]s and their organizations into action to accomplish missions. '''BC''' includes visualizing the current state and future state, formulating concepts of operations to get from one to the other, and doing so at least cost. Assigning missions, prioritizing and allocating resources, selecting the critical time and place to act, and knowing how and when to make adjustments during the fight are also included.&lt;ref name="fm1005"&gt;[[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 100-5|"Operations", FM&amp;nbsp;100–5]], Headquarters [[Department of the Army]], June 1993 [http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/service_pubs/fm100_5.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926050649/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/service_pubs/fm100_5.pdf |date=September 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FM 7-30===
'''BC''' is the art and science of battlefield decision making and leading soldiers and units to successfully accomplish the mission. The '''BC''' basic elements are decision making, leading, and controlling. The '''BC''' [[System of Systems]] at brigade level enables commanders to lead, prioritize, and allocate assets required to employ and sustain combat power. The brigade commander must see further, process information faster and strike more precisely and quicker. If information is the medium of the '''BC''' process, the '''BC''' system must provide the commander with timely and accurate information on which to base the commander's decision.&lt;ref name="fm730"&gt;"The Infantry Brigade", FM 7-30, Headquarters [[Department of the Army]], 3 October 1995 [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/7-30/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synonyms==
'''BC''' is also known by the following terms:

* [[C4ISTAR|Command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance]] ([[C4ISTAR|C4ISR]])

==Battle management==

'''Battle management''' ('''BM''') is the management of activities within the operational environment based on the commands, direction, and guidance given by appropriate authority.  BM is considered to be a subset of BC.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In some contexts (e.g. [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense#Description|BMC3]] and [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|C2BM]]), BM appears to be distinct from [[command and control (military)|command and control]].  In other contexts (e.g. [[Speech recognition#Battle management|Battle management command]]), BM appears to be a subset of [[command and control (military)|command and control]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jp102"&gt;"DoD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms", Joint Publication 1-02, [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]], 17 March 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108082044/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SA/SU is paramount for commanders to command and control modern [[military]] forces.

==Military acquisition==
The Department of the Army organization primarily responsible for the [[military acquisition|acquisition]] of the '''BC''' [[System of systems|SoS]] is the [[PM BC]], a subordinate organization within the [[PEO C3T]].

==Types==

===Battle command on the move (BCOTM)===
One of the problems with '''BC''' [[System of systems|SoS]] is that a [[commander]] has little [[communication]] while in the battlefield. [[command and control (military)|Command and control]] planning occurs at a [[Command and control (military)|command post]] (CP) or [[tactical operations center]] (TOC). Once a battle begins, a [[commander]] leaves the CP/TOC and moves forward to stay engaged. A commander has limited communication possibilities while in the battlefield, making it difficult to follow and control all events as they happen. ''Battle command on the move'' (BCOTM) is a capability that provides commanders all of the information resident in their CP/TOC and the required communications necessary to command and control on the move, or at a short halt, from any vantage point on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Rodney, Morley Rebecca, "Battle Command On The Move", [[CERDEC]], 4 November 2005, [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA432738&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond T.

[[File:Arms of Castile and Leon.svg|thumb|A common simple example of canting arms: the ''[[Heraldry of Castile|castle]]'' representing the Kingdom of ''[[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]'' and the ''[[Heraldry of León|lion]]'' representing the Kingdom of ''[[Kingdom of León|León]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/canting.htm|title=Tinctures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Canting arms''' are [[heraldry|heraldic]] bearings that represent the bearer's name (or, less often, some attribute or function) in a [[visual pun]] or [[rebus]]. The term was derived from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''cant'', meaning song or singing. 

French heralds used the term ''armes parlantes'' ({{Lang-en|"talking arms"}}), as they would sound out the name of the armiger. Many armorial allusions require research for elucidation because of changes in language and dialect that have occurred over the past millennium.

Canting arms – some in the form of rebuses – are quite common in German civic heraldry. They have also been increasingly used in the 20th century among the British royal family.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} When the visual representation is not straightforward but as complex as a [[rebus]], this is sometimes called a ''rebus coat of arms''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
An [[in-joke]] among [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] heralds is the [[pun]], "Heralds don't pun; they cant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Neznanich, Modar|title=Heraldry for Those Who Cant|url=http://www.modaruniversity.org/Heraldry-for-Those-Who-Cant.pdf|accessdate=2 July 2012}} Cites 72 historical examples of canting arms, as well as SCA usage.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of canting arms ==

=== Personal coat of arms ===
A famous example of canting arms are those of [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] (consort of King [[George VI]] of the United Kingdom). Her arms (pictured below) contain in sinister (i.e. on the bearer's left, viewer's right) the bows and blue lions that make up the arms of the Bowes and Lyon families.

'''Catherine de' Medici's building projects''' included the [[House of Valois|Valois]] chapel at [[Basilique Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], the [[Tuileries Palace]], and the Hôtel de la Reine in Paris, and extensions to the [[Château de Chenonceau|château of Chenonceau]],&lt;!--Please see thread at top of talk page for conventions of spelling, capitalisation, and language regarding "château" and related usages in this article--&gt; near [[Blois]]. Born in 1519 in Florence to an Italian father and a French mother, [[Catherine de' Medici]] was a daughter of both the [[Italian Renaissance|Italian]] and the [[French Renaissance]]. She grew up in Florence and Rome under the wing of the [[Medici]] popes, [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]. In 1533, at the age of fourteen, she left Italy and married [[Henry II of France|Henry]], the second son of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and [[Claude, Duchess of Brittany|Queen Claude]] of France. On doing so, she entered the greatest Renaissance court in northern Europe.&lt;ref name="Knecht1"&gt;Knecht, 220.&lt;/ref&gt; 

King Francis set his daughter-in-law an example of kingship and artistic patronage that she never forgot.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; She witnessed his huge architectural schemes at [[Château de Chambord|Chambord]] and [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]]. She saw Italian and French craftsmen at work together, forging the style that became known as the first [[School of Fontainebleau]]. Francis died in 1547, and Catherine became queen consort of France. But it wasn't until her husband King Henry's death in 1559, when she found herself at forty the effective ruler of France, that Catherine came into her own as a patron of architecture. Over the next three decades, she launched a series of costly building projects aimed at enhancing the grandeur of the monarchy. During the same period, however, religious civil war gripped the country and brought the prestige of the monarchy to a dangerously low ebb.&lt;ref&gt;"The [[Day of the Barricades]]" (12 May 1589), in which a mob took over the streets of Paris, "reduced the authority and prestige of the monarchy to its lowest ebb for a century and a half". Morris, 260.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Catherine loved to supervise each project personally.&lt;ref&gt;The architect [[Philibert de l'Orme]] wrote: "your good judgement (''bon esprit'') shows itself more and more and shines as you yourself take the trouble to project and sketch out (''protraire et esquicher'') the buildings which it pleases you to commission". Knecht, 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The architects of the day dedicated books to her, knowing that she would read them.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 228. The poet [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] accused her of preferring masons to poets.&lt;/ref&gt; Though she spent colossal sums on the building and embellishment of monuments and palaces, little remains of Catherine's investment today: one [[Doric order|Doric]] column, a few fragments in the corner of the Tuileries gardens, an empty tomb at Saint Denis. The sculptures she commissioned for the Valois chapel are lost, or scattered, often damaged or incomplete, in museums and churches. Catherine de' Medici's reputation as a sponsor of buildings rests instead on the designs and treatises of her architects. These testify to the vitality of French architecture under her patronage. 

==Influences==

Historians often assume that Catherine's love for the arts stemmed from her [[Medici]] heritage.&lt;ref name="Knecht1"/&gt;  "As the daughter of the Medici," suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, "she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died."&lt;ref&gt;Babelon, ''The Louvre'', 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Florence in 1519, Catherine lived at the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Medici palace]], built by [[Cosimo de' Medici]] to designs by [[Michelozzo| Michelozzo di Bartolomeo]].&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Rome in 1530, she lived, surrounded by classical and Renaissance treasures, at another Medici palace (now called the [[Palazzo Madama]]). There she watched the leading artists and architects of the day at work in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; When she later commissioned buildings herself, in France, Catherine often turned to Italian models. She based the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] on the [[Palazzo Pitti|Pitti palace]] in Florence;&lt;ref&gt;Hautecœur, 523.&lt;/ref&gt; and she originally planned the Hotel de la Reine with the [[Uffizi| Uffizi palace]] in mind.&lt;ref name="Thomson1"&gt;Thomson, 176.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Chat Chambord solcou 01 062006.jpg| thumb| left| [[Château de Chambord|Château of Chambord]], built by [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]]]]

Catherine, however, left Italy in 1533 at the age of fourteen and married [[Henry II of France|Henry of Orléans]], the second son of King [[Francis I of France]]. Though she kept in touch with her native Florence, her taste matured at the [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] royal court of France.&lt;ref name="Knecht1"/&gt;  Her father-in-law impressed Catherine deeply as an example of what a monarch should be.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht 176; Frieda, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; She later copied Francis' policy of setting the grandeur of the dynasty in stone, whatever the cost. His lavish building projects inspired her own.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 79, 455; Sutherland, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Francis was a compulsive builder. He began extension works at the [[Louvre]],&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 80. These extensions, supervised by [[Pierre Lescot]] and featuring relief sculptures by [[Jean Goujon]], were continued by the last four Valois kings.&lt;/ref&gt; added a wing to the old castle at [[Château de Blois|Blois]], and built the vast château of [[Château de Chambord|Chambord]], which he showed off to the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1539. He also transformed the lodge at [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] into one of the great palaces of Europe, a project that continued under [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]. Artists such as [[Rosso Fiorentino]] and [[Francesco Primaticcio]] worked on the interior, alongside French craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, 158.&lt;/ref&gt;  This meeting of Italian [[Mannerism]] and French patronage bred an original style, later known as the first [[School of Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring [[fresco]]es and high-relief [[stucco]] in the shape of parchment or curled leather [[strapwork]], it became the dominant decorative fashion in France in the second half of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine later herself employed Primaticcio to design her Valois chapel. She also patronised French talent, such as the architects [[Philibert de l'Orme]] and [[Jean Bullant]], and the sculptor [[Germain Pilon]].&lt;ref name="Knecht1"/&gt;

[[File:Insignias of Henri II of France and Catherine de Medici.jpg| thumb| Initials of Henry II and Catherine on a chimney at Chenonceau&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 111. Some scholars believe that the intertwined letter Cs may also refer to crescent moons, the emblem of Henry's lover [[Diane de Poitiers]] (the crescent moon was the symbol of the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]). However, Catherine continued to use this monogram after Henry's death.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The death of Henry II from [[jousting]] wounds in 1559 changed Catherine's life. From that day, she wore black and took as her emblem a broken lance.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; She turned her widowhood into a political force that validated her authority during the reigns of her three weak sons.&lt;ref&gt;"Catherine's lifelong mourning was not only a manner to express grief: it was also the legitimisation of her political role." Hoogvliet, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; She also became intent on immortalizing her sorrow at the death of her husband.&lt;ref name = "kccxxiii"&gt;Knecht, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; She had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings.&lt;ref name = "kccxxiii"/&gt;  She commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry, as the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel. 

In 1562, a long poem by Nicolas Houël likened Catherine to [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]], who had built the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum]] at [[Halicarnassus]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], as a tomb for her dead husband.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 266; Hoogvliet, 108. Louis Le Roy, in his ''Ad illustrissimam reginam D. Catherinam Medicem'' of 1560, was the first to call Catherine the "new Artemisia".&lt;/ref&gt;  Artemesia had also acted as regent for her children. Houël laid stress on Artemesia's devotion to architecture. In his dedication to ''L'Histoire de la Royne Arthémise'', he told Catherine: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;You will find here the edifices, columns, and pyramids that she had built both at Rhodes and Halicarnassus, which will serve as remembrances for those who reflect on our times and who will be astounded at your own buildings–the palaces at the Tuileries, Montceaux, and Saint-Maur, and the infinity of others that you have constructed, built, and embellished with sculptures and beautiful paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Knecht, 224. Catherine commissioned the artists [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] and [[Antoine Caron]] to illustrate the poem. The drawings were subsequently turned into tapestries, none of which survive; but, according to Knecht, fifty-nine of the drawings survive. Hoogvliet, 108, on the other hand, says that sixty-eight of the drawings survive.&lt;br /&gt;• Frieda, 266. The story of Artemisia formed an [[iconography]] for Catherine and reinforced her right to serve as regent. The later female regents [[Marie de' Medici]] (1610–20) and [[Anne of Austria]] (1643–60) revived this iconography in their own service.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Valois Chapel==
In memory of Henry II, Catherine decided to add a new chapel to the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint Denis]], where the kings of France were traditionally buried. As the centrepiece of this circular chapel, sometimes known as the Valois [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], she commissioned a magnificent and innovative tomb for Henry and herself. The design of this tomb should be understood in the context of its planned setting.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner, 383.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was to integrate the tomb's effigies of the king and queen with other statues throughout the chapel, creating a vast spatial composition. Catherine's approval would have been essential for such a departure from funerary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner, 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
To lead the Valois chapel project, Catherine chose [[Francesco Primaticcio]], who had worked for Henry at Fontainebleau. Primaticcio designed the chapel as a round building, crowned by a dome, to be joined to the north [[transept]] of the basilica. The interior and exterior of the chapel were to be decorated with [[pilaster]]s, columns, and [[epitaphs]] in coloured marble. The building would contain six other chapels circling the tomb of Henry and Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Primaticcio's circular design solved the problems faced by the Giusti brothers and [[Philibert de l'Orme]], who had built previous royal tombs. Whereas de l'Orme had designed the tomb of Francis I to be viewed only from the front or the side, Primaticcio's design allowed the tomb to be viewed from all angles.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historian Henri Zerner has called the plan "a grand ritualistic drama which would have filled the rotunda's celestial space".&lt;ref&gt;''L'art de la Renaissance en France. L'invention du classicisme'' (Zerner, 1996: 349–54), quoted by Knecht, 227.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Work on the chapel began in 1563 and continued over the next two decades. Primaticcio died in 1570, and the architect [[Jean Bullant]] took over the project two years later. After Bullant's death in 1578, [[Androuet du Cerceau|Baptiste du Cerceau]] led the work.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 226.&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was abandoned in 1585. Over two hundred years later, in 1793, a mob tossed Catherine and Henry's bones into a pit with the rest of the French kings and queens.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb===
[[File:Basilica di saint Denis tomba enrico II e caterina de' Medici 03.JPG| thumb|Effigies on the tomb of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and [[Catherine de' Medici]] at the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint Denis]], carved by [[Germain Pilon]]&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 227. Henry's gesture is now unclear, since a [[missal]], resting on a [[prie-dieu]] (prayer desk), was removed from the sculpture during the French revolution and melted down.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Several of the monuments built for the Valois chapel have survived. These include the tomb of Catherine and Henry—in Zerner's view, "the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance".&lt;ref name = "zccclxxvix"&gt;Zerner, 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Primaticcio himself designed its structure, which eliminated the traditional [[bas-relief]]s and kept ornamentation to a minimum.&lt;ref name = "zccclxxvix"/&gt; The sculptor [[Germain Pilon]], who had provided statues for the tomb of Francis I, carved the tomb's two sets of effigies, which represented death below and eternal life above.&lt;ref&gt;"With the rise of naturalistic representations beginning in the fifteenth century, the afterlife was imagined as an exact replica of earthly existence. As a result, the tombs of the mighty often insinuated an ambiguous conflation of the glorious Life Eternal with a glorification of their earthly lives." Zerner, 380.&lt;/ref&gt; The king and queen, cast in bronze, kneel in prayer (''priants'') on a marble canopy supported by twelve marble columns. Their poses echo those on the nearby tombs of [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] and [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. Pilon's feel for the material, however, invests his statues with a greater sense of movement.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 94. Blunt believes that [[Benvenuto Cellini]]'s Fontainebleau ''nymph'' may have influenced their carving.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before they were destroyed in the Revolution, the remains of the king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner 383–84. [[Girolamo della Robbia]] was originally commissioned to carve the queen's corpse, but his effort, in which Catherine looks emaciated, was left unfinished in 1566 and is now in the Louvre.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine's effigy suggests sleep rather than death, while Henry is posed strikingly, with his head thrown back.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner, 379; Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1583, Pilon also sculpted two later [[gisant]]s of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner suggests that these two, apparently superfluous, recumbent effigies, as rigid as those from the thirteenth century, might have been a "call to order". In the context of the wars of religion, they may have represented a pulling back from the sensuality of the tomb, which "was bound to appear somewhat pagan". Zerner, 382–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, he portrays Catherine realistically, with a double chin. These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 226–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilon's four bronze statues of the [[cardinal virtues]] stand at the corners of the tomb. Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall [[Pierre Bontemps|Bontemps']] work on the monument for the heart of Francis I.&lt;ref name = "bxivc"&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statuary===
[[File:Resurrection Pilon Louvre RF2292 MR1592 MR1593.jpg| thumb| Surviving fragments of [[Germain Pilon| Germain Pilon's]] ''Resurrection'' (1580s), commissioned by Catherine de' Medici for the Valois Chapel complex]]

In the 1580s, Pilon began work on statues for the chapels that were to circle the tomb. Among these, the fragmentary ''Resurrection'', now in the Louvre, was designed to face the tomb of Catherine and Henry from a side chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner, 383. Whereas the "Resurrection" for the tomb of Francis I was positioned close to the corpses, this design would have involved the visitor.&lt;/ref&gt; This work owes a clear debt to [[Michelangelo]], who had designed the tomb and funerary statues for Catherine's father at the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|Medici chapels]] in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 95. Pilon based the Christ on [[Michelangelo| Michelangelo's]] cartoon for ''Noli me tangere'' (1531) and carved the soldiers in Michelangelo's ''[[contrapposto]]'' style.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilon's statue of ''St Francis in Ecstasy'' now stands in the church of St Jean and St François. In art historian Anthony Blunt's view, it marks a departure from the tension of [[Mannerism]] and "almost foreshadows" the [[Baroque]].&lt;ref name = "bvc"&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pilon had by this time developed a freer style of sculpture than previously seen in France. Earlier French sculpture seems to have influenced him less than Primaticcio's decorations at Fontainebleau:&lt;ref name = "bxivc"/&gt; the work of his predecessor [[Jean Goujon]], for example, is more linear and classical.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 94, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pilon openly depicts extreme emotion in his work, sometimes to the point of the grotesque. His style has been interpreted as a reflection of a society torn by the conflict of the [[French Wars of Religion|French wars of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Montceaux==
Catherine's earliest building project was the château of [[Montceaux-en-Brie]], near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, three years before his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a [[pavilion#Classical architecture|pavilion]] at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played [[pall mall (game)|pall mall]], an early form of [[croquet]]. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a [[grotto]]. He set it on a base made to look like natural rock, from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 228–229.&lt;/ref&gt; The château ceased to be used as a royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Coope, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/750560 "The Chateau of Montceaux-en-Brie"], 71–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuileries==
[[File:Map of Tuileries and Louvre, as in c. 1589.png|thumb| Detail from a [[Eight maps of Paris from Traité de la police|1705 map of Paris]], showing the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] and the [[Louvre]] in about 1589]]

After the death of Henry II, Catherine abandoned the palace of the [[Hôtel des Tournelles|Tournelles]], where Henry had lain after a lance fatally pierced his eye and brain in a [[jousting|joust]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 104. Catherine planned a grid of streets to replace the palace, with houses designed by de l'Orme, but the work was never carried out. [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], who ruled France from 1589 to 1610, later constructed a square on the site called the Place Royale, now known as the [[Place des Vosges]].&lt;/ref&gt; To replace the Tournelles, she decided in 1563 to build herself a new Paris residence on the site of some old tile kilns or ''tuileries''. The site was close to the congested Louvre, where she kept her household. The grounds extended along the banks of the [[Seine]] and afforded a view of the countryside to the south and west.&lt;ref name = "cccxxxv"&gt;Frieda, 335.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] was the first palace that Catherine had planned from the ground up. It was to grow into the largest royal building project of the last quarter of the sixteenth century in western Europe. Her massive building schemes would have transformed western Paris, as seen from the river, into a monumental complex.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 165.&lt;br /&gt;• This [[:Image:Louvre tuileries.jpg|engraving]] by [[Matthäus Merian]] shows the complex in 1615, after [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV's]] additions.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Detail of the elevation of the court side of the de l'Orme wing of the Tuileries..jpg| thumb| left| Detail of the court side of the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]], designed by Philibert de l'Orme, drawn by [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]]]]

To design the new palace, Catherine brought back [[Philibert de l'Orme]] from disgrace. This arrogant genius had been sacked as superintendent of royal buildings at the end of [[Henry II of France|Henry II's]] reign, after making too many enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 229. Historian R. J. Knecht suggests, (after Blunt, ''Philibert de l'Orme'', London, 1958), that Catherine may have been moved to rehabilitate de l'Orme after reading his ''Instruction'', in which he defended himself against all charges and pleaded for fair treatment.&lt;br /&gt;• Randall, 82–84. The reasons for de l'Orme's disgrace are not clear, but it seems that he was prone to arrogance and had made enemies.&lt;br /&gt;• Zerner, 402. Zerner, who calls him "haughty", mentions allegations of [[embezzlement]] and an incident in which de l'Orme and his brother killed two men in a brawl.&lt;/ref&gt; De l'Orme mentioned the project in his treatises on architecture, but his ideas are not fully known. It appears from the small amount of work carried out that his plans for the Tuileries departed from his known principles. De l'Orme is said to have "taught France the classical style—lucid, rational and regular".&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes, however, that in this case he added rich materials and ornaments to please the queen.&lt;ref&gt;De l'Orme recorded that Catherine told him "to make several encrustations of different kinds of marble, gilded bronze and of minerals, like marcassites" on both the inside and the outside of the building. Knecht, 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The plans therefore include a decorative element that looks forward to [[Jean Bullant|Bullant's]] later work and to a less classical style of architecture.&lt;ref name = "blv"&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 55.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the [[pilaster]]s of Catherine's palace, de l'Orme chose the [[Ionic order]], which he considered a feminine form:

&lt;blockquote&gt; I will not go on to other matters without pointing out to you that I chose the present Ionic order, from amongst all others, in order to ornament and to give lustre to the palace, which Her Majesty the Queen, mother of the most Christian King Charles IX, today is having built at Paris ... The other reason why I wanted to use and to show the Ionic order properly, on the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, is because it is feminine and was devised according to the proportions and beauties of women and goddesses, as was the Doric to those of men, which is what the ancients have told me: for, when they decided to build a temple to a god, they used the Doric, and to a goddess, the Ionic. Yet all architects have not followed that [principle], shown in Vitruvius's text ... accordingly I have made use, at the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, of the Ionic order, on the view that it is delicate and of greater beauty than the Doric, and more ornamented and enriched with distinctive features.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Thomson, 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Catherine de' Medici was closely involved in planning and supervising the building.&lt;ref&gt;De l'Orme wrote that Catherine, with "an admirable understanding combined with great prudence and wisdom," took the trouble "to order the organization of her said palace (the Tuileries) as to the apartments and location of the halls, antechambers, chambers, closets and galleries, and to give the measurements of width and length". Quoted by Knecht, 228.&lt;/ref&gt; De l'Orme records, for example, that she told him to take down some Ionic columns that struck her as too plain. She also insisted on large panels between the [[dormer]]s to make room for inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 171; Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 55. The way the [[dormer]]s overlap the [[pediment]]ed panels gives the effect of blurrier lines than in the more classical works de l'Orme had designed for Henry II.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a part of de l'Orme's scheme was ever built: the lower section of a central pavilion, containing an oval staircase, and a wing on either side.&lt;ref name = "blv"/&gt; Though work on de l'Orme's design was abandoned in 1572, two years after his death, it is nonetheless held in high regard. According to Thomson, "The surviving portions of the palace scattered between the Tuileries gardens, the courtyards of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts [Paris] and the Château de la Punta in [[Corsica]] show that the columns, pilasters, dormers and tabernacles of the Tuileries were the outstanding masterpieces of non-figurative French Renaissance architectural sculpture".&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 171&lt;br /&gt;•  Pons, 79. Counts Jérome and Charles Pozzo di Borgo bought sections of the ruins during the demolition of the Tuileries in 1883 and used them to construct the château de la Punta in Corsica, overlooking the gulf of [[Ajaccio]] (1885–7).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Drawing of an enlarged project of 1578 to 1579 for the Tuileries, by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau.jpg|thumb|Drawing by [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]] of an enlarged project of 1578–1579 for the Tuileries, with oval halls]]

De l'Orme's original plans have not survived. [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]], however, has left us a set of plans for the Tuileries. One engraving shows a grandiose palace, with three courts and two oval halls. This design is atypical of de l'Orme's style and so is likely to have been du Cerceau's own proposal or his son Baptiste's.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 229; Thomson 165–66.&lt;/ref&gt; It recalls the houses with tall pavilions and multiple courtyards that du Cerceau often drew in the 1560s and 1570s. Architectural historian David Thomson suggests that the oval halls within du Cerceau's courtyards were Catherine de' Medici's idea. She may have planned to use them for her famously lavish balls and entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 168. In June 1565 and September 1581, Catherine had temporary oval structures built to house entertainments for state occasions.&lt;/ref&gt; Du Cerceau's drawings reveal that, before he published them in 1576, Catherine decided to join the Louvre to the Tuileries by a gallery running west along the north bank of the Seine. Only the ground floor of the first section, the ''Petite Galerie'', was completed in her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 173. The reliefs on the arches of the ''Petite Galerie'', like those on the court front of the Louvre, symbolise the might and [[moral authority]] of the Valois monarchy. Those of de l'Orme at the Tuileries are purely classical in style and follow the principles of [[Vitruvius]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was left to [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], who ruled from 1589 to 1610, to add the second floor and the ''Grande Galerie'' that finally linked the two palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine abandoned his design for a freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by [[Jean Bullant]]. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the [[classical order]]s, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 173–4. The only elements Bullant harmonised with de l'Orme's work were the ground-floor Ionic columns and the [[frieze]] and [[cornice]] between the first and ground floors.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dom Michel Felibien 001.jpg| thumb| left| [[Jean Bullant| Jean Bullant's]] pavilion at the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]], in an engraving of 1725 by Michel Félibien]]

Despite its unfinished state, Catherine often visited the palace. She held banquets and festivities there and loved to walk in the gardens.&lt;ref name = "cccxxxv"/&gt; According to the French military leader [[Gaspard de Saulx|Marshal Tavannes]], it was in the Tuileries gardens that she planned the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], in which thousands of Huguenots were butchered in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 306.&lt;/ref&gt; The gardens had been laid out before work on the palace halted. They included canals, fountains, and a grotto decorated with glazed animals by the potter [[Bernard Palissy]].&lt;ref name = "kccxxxii"&gt;Knecht, 232.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1573, Catherine hosted the famous entertainment at the Tuileries that is depicted on the [[Valois Tapestries|Valois tapestries]]. This was a grand ball for the Polish envoys who had come to offer the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|crown of Poland]] to her son, the duke of Anjou, later [[Henry III of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] later added to the Tuileries; but [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was to dismantle sections of the palace. The [[communards]] set fire to the remainder in 1871. Twelve years later, the ruins were demolished and then sold off.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saint-Maur==
The palace of [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]], south east of Paris, was another of Catherine's unfinished projects. She bought this building, on which Philibert de l'Orme had worked, from the heirs of [[Jean du Bellay|Cardinal Jean du Bellay]], after the latter's death in 1560.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt; She then commissioned de l'Orme to finish the work he had begun there. Drawings by [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]] in the [[British Museum]] may shed light on Catherine's intentions for Saint-Maur. They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling the size of the [[Pavilion#Classical architecture|pavilion]]s next to the main block of the house. The house was to stay as one storey, with a flat roof and [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] [[pilaster]]s. That meant the extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen from the side.&lt;ref name = "blv"/&gt;

De l'Orme died in 1570; in 1575 an unknown architect took over at Saint-Maur.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 89, believes this architect was [[Jean Bullant]], of whom he writes: "In these last years, Bullant's desire for the colossal seems to have grown greater, and in this case it could not be harmonized with the existing building".&lt;/ref&gt; The new man proposed to heighten the pavilions on the garden side and top them with pitched roofs. He also planned two more arches over de l'Orme's terrace, which joined the pavilions on the garden side.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 231. The terrace was supported by a [[cryptoporticus]], a covered passageway.&lt;/ref&gt; In historian R. J. Knecht's view, the scheme would have given this part of the house, a "colossal, even grotesque" [[pediment]].&lt;ref name ="ccxxxi"&gt;Knecht, 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was only partly carried out, and the house was never fit for Catherine to live in.

==Hôtel de la Reine==
[[File:Soisson.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A 1650 engraving by [[Israel Silvestre|Israël Silvestre]] of the Hôtel de la Reine in [[Paris]]: the central and right-hand sections are those built during Catherine's lifetime. The Colonne de l'Horoscope can be seen in the background, to the right.]]
{{main|Hôtel de Soissons}}

After de l'Orme's death, Jean Bullant replaced him as Catherine's chief architect. In 1572, Catherine commissioned Bullant to build a new home for her within the Paris city walls. She had outgrown her apartments at the Louvre and needed more room for her swelling household.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 230. Between 1575 and 1583, for example, the number of Catherine's ladies-in-waiting rose from 68 to 111.&lt;/ref&gt; To make space for the new scheme and its gardens, she had an entire area of Paris demolished.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 335. The area, in the parish of [[Église Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]], included the Hôtel Guillart and the Hôtel d'Albret.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new palace was known in Catherine's time as the Hôtel de la Reine and later as the Hôtel de Soissons.&lt;ref name="Thomson1"/&gt; Engravings made by [[Israel Silvestre|Israël Silvestre]] in about 1650 and a plan from about 1700 show that the Hôtel de la Reine possessed a central wing, a courtyard, and gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Hotel de la reine 1700.jpg|Plan of the Hôtel de la Reine, from an engraving of about 1700.]] Thomson, 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The walled gardens of the hôtel included an [[aviary]], a lake with a water jet, and long avenues of trees. Catherine also installed an [[orangery]] that could be dismantled in winter.&lt;ref name = "kccxxxii"/&gt; The actual construction work was carried out after Bullant's death in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 176–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The building  was demolished in the 1760s.
All that remains of the Hôtel de la Reine today is a single [[Doric order|Doric]] column, known as the Colonne de l'Horoscope or [[Medici column]], which stood in the courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 176&lt;/ref&gt; It can be seen next to the domed [[Bourse de commerce (Paris)|Bourse de commerce]]. Catherine's biographer Leonie Frieda has called it "a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of power".&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 455.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chenonceau== 
[[File:Schloss Chenonceau.JPG| thumb| Catherine had two galleries built on Diane's bridge over the [[Cher River]] at [[Château de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]].]]

In 1576, Catherine decided to enlarge her château of [[Château de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]], near Blois. On Henry II's death, she had demanded this property from Henry's mistress [[Diane de Poitiers]]. She had not forgotten that Henry had given this crown property to Diane instead of to her.&lt;ref name = "fcxxxxiv"&gt;Frieda, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In return, she gave Diane the less prized [[Château de Chaumont|Chaumont]].&lt;ref name = "kccxxxii"/&gt;  When Diane arrived at Chaumont, she found signs of the occult, such as [[pentagram|pentangles]] drawn on the floor. She quickly withdrew to her château of [[château d'Anet|Anet]] and never set foot in Chaumont again.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Diane had carried out major works at Chenonceau, such as de l'Orme's bridge over the [[Cher River]]. Now Catherine set out to efface or outdo her former rival's work.&lt;ref name = "fcxxxxiv"/&gt; She lavished vast sums on the house and built two galleries on the extension over the bridge. The architect was almost certainly Bullant. The decorations show the fantasy of his late style.&lt;ref name = "blxxxix"&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 89.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:SchlossChenonceauPlanvonKatharinavonMedici.png| left| thumb| [[Jean Bullant| Jean Bullant's]] planned enlargements at [[Chenonceau]] (c. 1572), drawn by [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]], 1579]]
Catherine loved gardens and often conducted business in them.&lt;ref&gt;Benes, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; At Chenonceau, she added waterfalls, [[menagerie]]s, and [[aviary|aviaries]], laid out three parks, and planted [[mulberry]] trees for [[Bombyx mori|silkworms]].&lt;ref name = "kccxxxii"/&gt;  [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]] made drawings of a grandiose scheme for Chenonceau. A [[trapezoid]]al lower court leads to a forecourt of semicircular [[atrium (architecture)|atria]] joined to two halls that flank the original house.&lt;ref name = "tclxxv"&gt;Thomson, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; These drawings may not be a reliable record of Bullant's plans. Du Cerceau "sometimes inserted in his book designs embodying ideas which he himself would have liked to see carried out rather than those of the actual designer of the building in question".&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 232, quotes Blunt, ''Philibert de l'Orme'' (London, 1958), 89–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Androuet du Cerceau was a favourite architect of Catherine's. Like Bullant, he became a more fantastical designer with time.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing he built himself, however, has survived. He is known instead for his engravings of the leading architectural schemes of the day, including Saint-Maur, the Tuileries, and Chenonceau.&lt;ref name = "tclxxv"/&gt; In 1576 and 1579, he produced the two-volume ''Les Plus Excellents Bastiments de France'', a beautiful publication dedicated to Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 91. The original drawings are now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; His work is an invaluable record of buildings that were never finished or were later substantially altered.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the dynasty==
Catherine spent ruinous sums of money on buildings at a time of plague, famine, and economic hardship in France. &lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, 280–81. So widespread and serious was the plague of 1565, for example, that Catherine had the surgeon [[Ambroise Paré]] write an account of it. He concluded that plague resulted from poisoning of the air and was "often sent by the just anger of God punishing our offences".&lt;/ref&gt; As the country slipped deeper into anarchy, her plans grew ever more ambitious.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the Valois monarchy was crippled by debt and its [[moral authority]] was in steep decline. The popular view condemned Catherine's building schemes as obscenely extravagant. This was especially true in Paris, where the ''[[parlement]]'' was often asked to contribute to her costs. 

[[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] captured the mood in a poem:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The queen must cease building,
Her lime must stop swallowing our wealth...
Painters, masons, engravers, stone-carvers
Drain the treasury with their deceits.
Of what use is her Tuileries to us?
Of none, Moreau; it is but vanity.
It will be deserted within a hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 233. Ronsard addressed these lines to the financial official Raoul Moreau. ''Au tresorier de l'esparne'' (ca. 1573).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ronsard was in many ways proved correct. The death of Catherine's beloved son [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] in 1589, a few months after her own, brought the Valois dynasty to an end. Precious little of Catherine's grand building work has survived.

The '''''Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae''''' ([[Latin]]: ''[[text corpus|Corpus]] of Byzantine history writers''), frequently referred to as the '''CSHB''' or '''Bonn Corpus''', is a monumental fifty-volume series of [[primary sources]] for the study of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] history (c. 330–1453), published in the German city of [[Bonn]] between 1828 and 1897. Each volume contains a [[text criticism|critical edition]] of a [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine Greek]] historical text, accompanied by a parallel Latin translation. The project, conceived by the historian [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], sought to revise and expand the original twenty-four volume ''Corpus Byzantinae Historiae'' (sometimes called the ''Byzantine du Louvre''), &lt;ref name&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lifelettersofbar00nieb ''The Life and Letters of Barthold George Niebuhr''], ed. K. J. Bunsen, with J. Brandis and J. W. Lorbell (New York: Harper, 1854) p. 483, and letter 364 (pp. 501-502), addressed to [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]], dated 29 April 1827: "You will have heard of the edition of the Byzantine historians, which I am superintending. It is a great delight to me to be able thus to infuse some life into our literary doings; to give employment to young philologists; to give extension, activity, and perfection to typography; to contribute my mite [''sic''] to the increase of general prosperity...."&lt;/ref&gt; published in [[Paris]] between 1648 and 1711 under the initial direction of the [[Jesuit]] scholar [[Philippe Labbe]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Omont, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nyEMAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=philippe+labbe+byzance+du+louvre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5siRwr5HuN&amp;sig=jisLllTg1AhrOZbx_tffsIENaNg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W3CnVNKJF8_qgwTkt4HgCQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "La collection byzantine de Labbe et le projet de J. M. Suarès"], ''Revue des études grecques'' 17 (1904), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The series was first based at the [[University of Bonn]]; after Niebuhr's death in 1831, however, oversight of the project passed to his collaborator [[August Immanuel Bekker|Immanuel Bekker]] at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Reinsch [https://books.google.com/books?id=M-SrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA435&amp;lpg=PA435&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The History of Editing Byzantine Historiographical Texts"], in ''The Byzantine World'', ed. P. Stephenson (New York: Routledge, 2010), p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

While the first volume of the series was praised for its "minute care and attention" to textual details,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QGYJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA574&amp;lpg=PA574&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Niebuhr's Edition of the Byzantine Historians"] ''The Foreign Review'' 1 (1828), p. 575. However, the anonymous reviewer does criticize Niebuhr for standardizing of Byzantine orthography along Classical lines&lt;/ref&gt; later volumes produced under Bekker became infamous for their frequent misprints, careless execution, and general unreliability.&lt;ref&gt;Reinsch, ''op. cit.'', reports that [[August Heisenberg]], professor of Byzantine literature at Munich, once said of Bekker that he "must have revised the texts 'lying on the sofa with the cigar in his mouth.'" J. B. Bury was even harsher in his assessment, calling the CSHB "the most lamentably feeble production ever given to the world by German scholars of great reputation." See: ''idem'' [https://archive.org/details/historyofdecl01gibb "Introduction"], to [[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', vol. 1, ed. J. B. Bury (London: Meuthen, 1897), p. xlix.&lt;/ref&gt; Given these shortcomings, the [[International Association of Byzantine Studies]] established in 1966 the ''[[Corpus Fontium Historiae Byzantinae]]'' to re-edit many of the texts included in the Bonn edition of the CSHB.

'''David Durand''' (1680 – 16 January 1763) was an [[Huguenot]] [[French people|French]] and [[English people|English]] [[minister (religion)|minister]] and [[historian]]. He was born in [[Languedoc]] and fled [[France]] to [[the Netherlands]] before heading to [[Spain]] with a group of refugees, being captured at the [[Battle of Almanza]] in 1707 and being sent to France and then escaping to the Netherlands again. He was a minister in [[Rotterdam]] and became a friend of [[Pierre Bayle]]'s there.

He moved to England in 1711 and served as a pastor to the [[Church of England]] [[French language|French-speaking]] churches in London.  He became a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1728.  During his time in England, he wrote many works in French, most of them history.  His continuation of [[Paul de Rapin]]'s ''History of England'' (1734) was the most successful of his works.  Although it was written for a French audience, it was the most authoritative history of England for some years.  He also wrote histories of the 16th century, of Classical painting, and a literary work where he attempted a French-language imitation of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.  He never married, and died in 1763.

Known as '''Le''' among his friends and family, Lyons was born in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]], in 1923, where his father was a bank official. He was born into an [[Irish Protestant]] family of [[Presbyterian]] and [[Church of Ireland]] background. After his birth, his family soon moved to [[Boyle, County Roscommon]], [[Irish Free State]].

Lyons became Provost of Trinity College in 1974, but relinquished the post in 1981 to concentrate on writing. His work ''Charles Stewart Parnell'' won the Heinemann Prize in 1978. He won the [[Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize]] and the [[Wolfson History Prize|Wolfson Literary Prize for History]] for his book ''Culture and Anarchy in Ireland, 1890-1939'', published in 1979. He was awarded honorary doctorates by five universities and was a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] and of the [[British Academy]] and was Visiting Professor at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name="UB"/&gt;

His principal works include ''Ireland Since the Famine'', the standard university textbook for Irish history from the mid-19th to late-20th century, which ''[[The Times]]'' called "the definitive work of modern Irish history" and a [[biography]] of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

Lyons was critical of [[Cecil Woodham-Smith]]'s much-acclaimed history of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] and has generally been considered among the "revisionist" historians whose political sympathies underplayed the negative role of the British state in events like the Famine.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly Jr, [http://www.historyireland.com/the-famine/the-great-famine-and-its-interpreters-old-and-new/ The Great Famine and its interpreters, old and new], historyireland.com; accessed 12 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a short illness, Lyons died in Dublin in 1983, just shy of his 60th birthday. He was survived by his wife Jennifer McAlister Lyons, whom he married in 1964, and their two sons.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

'''Geoffrey Fillingham Nuttall''' [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] [[King's College London|FKC]] (8 November 1911 – 24 July 2007) was a British [[Congregational]] minister and church historian.

Nuttall was born in [[Colwyn Bay]], [[North Wales]], the son of the [[general practitioner]].  He was educated at [[Bootham School]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/view/article/99038 ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'']{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bootham Old Scholars Association |title=Bootham School Register|place=York, England|publisher=BOSA|year=2011|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] school in [[York]], and read [[Moderations|Mods]] and [[Greats]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and then Theology at [[Mansfield College, Oxford]].  He was a student pastor at [[Benson, Oxfordshire]], and studied at [[Marburg]] from 1936 to 1937 under the direction of [[Theodor Sippell]].

He emulated his grandfathers, both of whom were Congregational ministers, when he was [[ordained]] into the [[Congregational]] ministry in 1938 at [[Warminster]].  He was the minister at Common Close Congregational Church in Warminster from 1938 to 1943, then moved into theological training, first at the Quaker study centre at [[Woodbrooke College]] in the [[Selly Oak Colleges]], Birmingham.  In 1945, he became only the second [[nonconformism|nonconformist]] theologian to become [[Doctor of Divinity]] at [[Oxford University]].  That year, he became a lecturer in church history at [[New College London]], where he remained until his retirement in 1977.  He was the Chairman of the Board of Studies in Theology from 1957 to 1959, Dean of the Faculty of Theology from 1960 to 1964, and New College Librarian from 1958 to 1977.  He was also a trustee of [[Dr Williams's Library]] from 1947.

He was a founder member of the [[Ecclesiastical History Society]], and was its President in 1972, the first person to serve in that position who was not a professor.  He was also president of the historical societies of the Society of Friends, the Congregationalists and [[United Reformed Church]].  He helped to write ''A Congregational Declaration of Faith'' in the early 1960s.

His general area of academic interest was 17th century church history, with a special interest in [[Richard Baxter]] and [[Philip Doddridge]].  Until his death, he was consulted for his expert opinion on matters of church history.

He was a noted lecturer and contributed articles to learned journals, the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' and the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. He was the author of several books on the church and religious subjects generally. His most celebrated publications were probably ''The Holy Spirit in Puritan Faith and Experience'' (1946; reprinted by Chicago University Press, 1992, without his permission, {{ISBN|0-226-60941-3}}), based on his Oxford doctoral thesis, in which he argued that [[Quakerism]] was a logical development of [[Puritan]]ism, and ''Visible Saints: The Congregational Way 1640-1660'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1957, 2nd edition with additional material Weston Rhyn: Quinta Press, 2001, {{ISBN|1-897856-12-1}}). He also wrote books on [[Richard Baxter]], [[Philip Doddridge]] and [[Howell Harris]].  He gave the [[Hibbert Lecture]] in 1964, on ''The Beginnings of Nonconformity'', and the [[Ethel Wood Lecture]] in 1978, entitled ''The Moment of Recognition: Luke as Storyteller''.  He also gave the [[F.D. Maurice Lectures]] at [[King's College London]] and the [[Charles Gore Lectures]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].  He also studied [[Erasmus]] and [[Dante]], publishing ''The Faith of Dante Alighieri'' in 1969.

A [[festschrift]] was published on his retirement in 1977, "Reformation, Conformity and Dissent, Essays in honour of Geoffrey Nuttall" edited by Buick Knox (London: Epworth Press, 1977, {{ISBN|0-7162-0288-3}}). This contains a bibliography of his writings up to 1977.  A further bibliography from 1977 was published in the ''Journal of the URC Historical Society''.

Two collections of his essays and articles have been published in recent years, "Studies in English Dissent" (Weston Rhyn: Quinta Press, 2003, {{ISBN|1-897856-14-8}}) and "Early Quaker Studies and The Divine Presence" (Weston Rhyn: Quinta Press,2003, {{ISBN|1-897856-22-9}}).

After his retirement, he was a Visiting Professor at [[King's College London]] from 1977 to 1980, and was appointed a Fellow of [[King's College London]] in 1977.  He became an honorary DD at the [[University of Wales]] in 1969, and became a vice-president of the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]] in 1978.  He became a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1991.

He married Mary Powley (née Preston) in 1944, having met while he was at Woodbrooke, where she was Secretary. She was the widow of GP Powley, and died in 1982. He suffered a [[stroke]] in 2000, and passed his final years in a nursing home near [[Bromsgrove]], in Worcestershire, where he died. His funeral took place at [[Lodge Hill Cemetery|Lodge Hill Crematorium]], [[Selly Oak]], Birmingham on 8 August 2007 and was followed by a Thanksgiving Service at Bournville United Reformed Church, Beaumont Road, where he was a member up to his death.

== Career ==
Belli began her career at [[Pepsi Cola|Pepsi-Cola]] as liaison to the company's advertising agency, Publisa, which then hired her as an account executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Country Under My Skin|last=Belli|first=Giaconda|publisher=Random House|year=2003|isbn=0-375-40370-1|location=New York|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through one of her colleagues at the advertising agency, Belli met [[Camilo Ortega]], who introduced her to the [[Sandinistas]] and asked her to join the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Country Under My Skin|last=Belli|first=Giaconda|publisher=Random House|year=2003|isbn=0-375-40370-1|location=New York|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halleck|first=Kenia|date=Winter 2001|title=Gioconda Belli|url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/2377/gioconda-belli|journal=BOMB Magazine|volume=74|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belli joined the struggle against the [[Somoza]] [[dictatorship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.twbookmark.com/authors/36/1125/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 14, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503011152/http://www.twbookmark.com/authors/36/1125/index.html |archive-date=May 3, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; sworn into the movement by Camilo Ortega's wife Leana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Country Under My Skin|last=Belli|first=Giaconda|publisher=Random House|year=2003|isbn=0-375-40370-1|location=New York|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belli's work for the movement led to her being forced into [[exile]] in Mexico in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/3136|title=Revista Envío - Women, Poetry, New Nicaraguan Culture|website=www.envio.org.ni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning in 1979 just before the Sandinista victory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlindo-correia.org/020303.html|title=GIOCONDA BELLI|website=www.arlindo-correia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; she became [[FSLN]]'s international press liaison in 1982 and the director of State Communications in 1984. During that time she met Charles Castaldi, an American [[NPR]] journalist, whom she married in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticasmagazine.com/article/CA6383045.html|title=criticasmagazine.com – Casino Magazin|website=www.criticasmagazine.com|access-date=March 14, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206121138/http://www.criticasmagazine.com/article/CA6383045.html|archive-date=February 6, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been living in both [[Managua]] and Los Angeles since 1990. She has since left the FSLN and is now a major critic of the current government.

===Writing===
[[File:Gioconda Belli 1989 (cropped from Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0519-022, Berlin, Verleihung eines Literatur-Stipendiums).jpg|thumb|Belli in 1989]]
In 1970, Belli published her first poems in the literary supplement of Nicaraguan newspaper ''[[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Country Under My Skin|last=Belli|first=Giaconda|publisher=Random House|year=2003|isbn=0-375-40370-1|location=New York|pages=37-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, she won the Premio de Poesía Mariano Fiallos Gil award from the [[Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.los-poetas.com/n/biobelli.htm|title=Biografia de Gioconda Belli|website=www.los-poetas.com|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Country Under My Skin|last=Belli|first=Giaconda|publisher=Random House|year=2003|isbn=0-375-40370-1|location=New York|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Belli's book ''La Mujer Habitada'' (The Inhabited Woman), a [[semi-autobiographical novel]] that raised gender issues for the first time in the Nicaraguan revolutionary narratives, brought her increased attention; this book has been published in several languages and was on the reading list at four universities in the United States. The novel follows two parallel stories: the indigenous resistance to the Spanish and modern insurgency in Central America with various points in common: women's emancipation, passion, and a commitment to liberation. In 2000, she published her autobiography, emphasizing her involvement in the revolutionary movement, ''El país bajo mi piel,'' published under the name ''The Country Under My Skin'' in the United States; it was a finalist for the [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=REVOLUTION: A User's Manual | url =http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/pep/pepdesc.cfm?id=1973 | work =The New York Public Library | accessdate = 2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belli continues publishing and maintains that poetry is her most important work. Belli was the recipient of the [[Premio Casa de las Américas]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us/commentisfree|title=Comment, opinion and discussion from the Guardian US|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Belli received the [[Premio Biblioteca Breve]] for her book ''El infinito en la palma de la mano'' (Infinity in the Palm of The Hand), an [[allegory]] about [[Adam and Eve]] in paradise.&lt;ref name=Breve&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2008/02/05/actualidad/1202166005_850215.html |title=La escritora nicaragüense Gioconda Belli gana el premio Biblioteca Breve |trans-title=The Nicaraguan Writer Gioconda Belli Wins the Premio Biblioteca Breve |work=[[El País]] |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |date=February 5, 2008 |access-date=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belli's books have been published in numerous languages.

Her 2010 book was submitted with the title "Cronicas de la Izquierda Erótica", but had to be changed to "El País de las Mujeres", since the previous title was too similar to that of a 1973 book by [[Ana María Rodas]]: ''Poemas de la Izquierda Erótica''. The book tells the story of a world governed by women. In the novel she portrays a group of women that take power by means of a Political Party by the name of "Partido de la Izquierda Erotica". This is the same name as a movement formed by women during the 80s, to which Belli belonged, which had been named as a tribute to Rodas´ work.

'''Hainuwele''', "The Coconut Girl", is a figure from the [[Wemale]] and [[Alune]] folklore of the island of [[Seram]] in the [[Maluku Islands]], [[Indonesia]]. Her story is an [[origin myth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195156690.001.0001/acref-9780195156690-e-657 The Oxford Companion to World Mythology - Hainuwele]&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth of Hainuwele was recorded by [[German people|German]] ethnologist [[Adolf Ellegard Jensen|Adolf E. Jensen]] following the [[Leo Frobenius|Frobenius Institute]]'s 1937–8 expedition to the Maluku Islands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adolf E. Jensen|Jensen, Adolf E.]] and Herman Niggemeyer, ''Hainuwele ; Völkserzählungen von der Molukken-Insel Ceram'' (Ergebnisse der Frobenius-Expedition vol. I), Frankfurt-am-Main 1939&lt;/ref&gt; The study of this myth during his research on [[sacrifice|religious sacrifice]] led Jensen to the introduction of the concept of [[Dema Deity]] in [[ethnology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelstausberg.net/old_site/Texts/Western%20Europe%20RELIGION%20II%20pre-proof.pdf The study of religion(s) in Western Europe II - Michael Stausberg]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Campbell]] first narrated the Hainuwele legend to an English-speaking audience in his work ''[[The Masks of God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Campbell|Campbell, Joseph]], ''The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology'', 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myth==
While hunting one day a man named Ameta found a [[coconut]], something never before seen on Seram, that had been caught in the tusk of a [[wild boar]]. Ameta, who was part of one of the original nine families of the West Ceram people who had emerged from [[banana]]s, took the coconut home. That night, a figure appeared in a dream and instructed him to plant the coconut. Ameta did so, and in just a few days the coconut grew into a tall tree and bloomed. Ameta climbed the tree to cut the flowers to [[Palm wine#Tapping|collect the sap]], but in the process slashed his finger and the blood dropped onto a blossom. Nine days later, Ameta found in the place of this blossom a girl whom he named Hainuwele, meaning "Coconut Branch". He wrapped her in a [[sarong]] and brought her home. She grew to maturity with astonishing rapidity. Hainuwele had a remarkable talent: when she defecated she excreted valuable items. Thanks to these, Ameta became very rich.

Hainuwele attended a dance that was to last for nine nights at a place known as ''Tamene Siwa''. In this dance, it was traditional for girls to distribute [[areca nut]]s to the men. Hainuwele did so, but when the men asked her for areca nuts, she gave them instead the valuable things which she was able to excrete. Each day she gave them something bigger and more valuable: [[gold]]en [[earring]]s, [[coral]], [[porcelain]] dishes, [[Parang (knife)|bush-knives]], [[copper]] boxes, and [[gong]]s. The men were happy at first, but gradually they decided that what Hainuwele was doing was [[uncanny]] and, driven by jealousy, they decided to kill her on the ninth night.

In the successive dances, the men circled around the women at the center of the dance ground, Hainuwele amongst them, who handed out gifts.  Before the ninth night, the men dug a pit in the center of the dance ground and, singling out Hainuwele, in the course of the dance they pushed her further and further inward until she was pushed right into the pit. The men quickly heaped earth over the girl, covering her cries with their song. Thus Hainuwele was buried alive, while the men kept dancing on the dirt stomping it firmly down.

Ameta, missing Hainuwele, went in search for her. Through an [[oracle]] he found out what had happened, then he exhumed her corpse and cut it into pieces which he then re-buried around the village. These pieces grew into various new useful plants, including [[tuber]]s, giving origin to the principal foods the people of [[Indonesia]] have enjoyed ever since.

Ameta brought Hainuwele's cut arms to ''mulua Satene'', the ruling deity over humans. With them, she built for him a gate in spiral shape through which all men should pass. Those who would be able to step across the gate would remain human beings, although henceforward mortal, becoming divided into ''Patalima'' (Men of the five) and ''Patasiwa'' (Men of the nine). Those unable to pass through the threshold became new kinds of animals or [[ghost]]s. Satene herself left the Earth and became ruler over the realm of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Hainuwele.'' Pg. 59–64&lt;/ref&gt; ''Patasiwa'' is the group to which both the Wemale and the Alune people belong.

==Analysis and interpretation==

===Dema deity myth===

Hainuwele can be understood as a [[creation myth]] in which the natural environment, the daily tasks of men and the social structures are given a meaning. In the myth spirits and plants are created and an explanation is provided for the mortality of mankind and the formation of tribal divisions within the Wemale ethnic group. Jensen identifies the Hainuwele figure with a [[Dema deity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jensen: ''Hainuwele.'' pg. 88–111, especially paragraph 107. Compare also Jensen: ''Mythos und Kult bei Naturvölkern.'' pg. 142, 240&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jensen the belief in a Dema deity is typical of cultures based on basic plant cultivation as opposed to cultures of [[hunter-gatherer]]s, as well as complex agricultural cultures such as those based on the cultivation of [[grain]]. Jensen identifies the veneration of Dema deities in the context of many different cultures worldwide. He assumes that it dates back to the [[Neolithic revolution]] in the early history of mankind. One of the main characteristics of Dema deities is that they are killed by early immortal men (‘Dema’) and hacked to pieces which are strewn about or buried.

Jensen found versions of the basic pattern of what could be defined as "Hainuwele Complex," in which a ritual murder and burial originates the tuberous crops on which people lived, spread throughout [[Southeast Asia]] and elsewhere. He contrasted these myths of the first era of agriculture, using root crops, with those in Asia and beyond that explained the origin of rice as coming from a theft from heaven, a pattern of myth found among grain-crop agriculturalists. These delineate two different eras and cultures in the [[history of agriculture]] itself.
The earliest one transformed hunting-and-gathering societies' [[totemistic]] myths such as we find in [[Australian Aboriginal]] cultures, in response to the discovery of food cultivation, and centered on a Dema" deity arising from the earth, and the later-developing grain-crop cultures centered on a [[sky god]]. Jensen explored the far-reaching culture-historical implications of these and other insights in his later work ''Myth and Cult among Primitive Peoples'', published in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Adolf E. Jensen, ''Myth and Cult among Primitive Peoples'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963), pp. 88-111, especially pp. 107ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The veneration of a Dema-deity implies that the creation of new life is inevitably attached to the end of life, to death. In the light of this fact Jensen indicates that some rituals of the Wemale people, such as the “Maro dance”, include many elements of the Hainuwele myth. Therefore, myth and ritual were structured in a unity of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen: ''Hainuwele.'' pg. 17. Compare with Jensen: ''Mythos und Kult bei Naturvölkern.'' pg. 239f, 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research, however, disputes the use of the term Dema-deity in the context of the Hainuwele story. It disagrees with the definition of the legend as a creation myth, preferring to define it as an origin myth. From the standpoint of cultural morphology, the idea of the Dema-deity is already problematic. Jensen assumes a connection between highly dissimilar myths of different cultures located in areas that are separated by great distances. Moreover, these purported parallels are not supported by archaeological or empirical data.

===Social anthropological interpretation===

Currently the interpretation of the Hainuwele myth puts more stress on the [[social anthropology|social anthropological]] aspects. Therefore, it underlines the fact that, since she had defecated them, the gifts that the generous girl Hainuwele was giving out had an unclean origin and, although useful, they defiled the persons accepting them. The uncanny way in which the material gifts were brought forward points out the reality that all the objects enumerated in the myth were foreign, not produced in Seram, and thus not available on the island before the 16th century.

Hainuwele's variety of presents brought about an element of [[corruption]], bringing about inequality, greed, and jealousy into a roughly homogeneous society, represented by the standard present of areca nuts. Hence the various gifts of the Coconut girl can be interpreted as "[[Bribery|dirty money]]", polluting and degrading everyone who accepts it, bringing about a [[socioeconomic]] conflict and the deviation from an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] state. Thus, the Hainuwele legend as recorded by Jensen was a myth that sought to rearrange the inconsistencies with which the Wemale were confronted as the elements of change affected their society by trying to bring about agreement of the more recent socioeconomic clash with the older mythical representations.

Following the conflict brought about by the material objects that were obtained through Hainuwele the introduction of mortality among humans became a sort of compensation in order to reintroduce peace with the world of spirits and deities. Thus the Hainuwele myth signals the end of an era and the beginning of another.&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton L. Mack|Burton Mack]], "Introduction: Religion and Ritual". In: Robert G. Hamerton-Kelly (Hrsg.): ''Violent Origins. Walter Burkert, René Girard, and Jonathan Z. Smith on Ritual Killing and Cultural Formation''.

A major role in the [[Hamidian massacres|Armenian massacres]] of 1894-96 had been often ascribed to the ''Hamidiye'' regiments, particularly during the bloody suppression of the revolt of the Armenians of Sasun (1894), but recent research contends that the ''Hamidiye'' played a less important role than previously assumed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/278219/_Les_Freres_De_Terre_Et_DEau_Sur_Le_Role_Des_Kurdes_Dans_Les_Massacres_Armeniens_De_1894_-1896_ Verheij, Jelle (1998).

== Historical background ==

[[Abdul Hamid II]]'s reign has the reputation of being "the most [[despotic]] and centralized era in modern Ottoman History." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Stephen Duguid, The Politics of Unity: Hamidian Policy of Eastern Anatolia, 139&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul Hamid is also considered the last sultan to have full control over [[Ottoman Empire]]. His reign struggled with the culmination of 75 years of change throughout the empire and an opposing reaction to that change.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Abdul Hamid II]] was particularly concerned with the centralization of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Bayram Kodaman, The Hamidiye Light Cavalry Regiments (Abdullmacid II and Eastern Anatolian Tribes)&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts to centralize the Sublime Porte were not unheard of among other sultans. The Ottoman Empire's local provinces had more control over their areas than the central government. Abdul Hamid II's foreign relations came from a "policy of non-commitment." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;M.Sükrü Hanioglu, A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The sultan understood the fragility of the Ottoman military, and the Empire's weaknesses of its domestic control.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Pan-Islamism became Abdülhamid's solution to the empire's loss of identity and power.&lt;ref&gt;M.Sükrü Hanioglu, A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire, 130.&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts to promote Pan-Islamism were for the most part unsuccessful because of the large non-Muslim population, and the European influence onto the empire.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Dr. Bayram Kodaman, The Hamidiye Light Cavalry Regiments (Abdullmacid II and  Eastern Anatolian Tribes)&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul Hamid II's policies essentially isolated the Ottoman Empire, which further aided in its decline. Several of the elite who sought a new constitution and reform for the empire were forced to flee to Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; After the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]], the Ottoman Empire began to contract and it lost certain territories. New groups of radicals began to threaten the power of the Ottoman Empire.

== Creation of Hamidieh cavalry ==
There are several reasons advanced as to why the Hamidiye light cavalry was created. The establishment of the Hamidieh was in one part a response to the Russian threat, but scholars believe that the central reason was to suppress [[Armenians|Armenian]] socialist/nationalist revolutionaries.&lt;ref name="newperspectivesonturkey.net"&gt;[http://www.newperspectivesonturkey.net/Journal/Lecture/13 Summary of] Janet Klein's ''Power in the Periphery: The Hamidiye Light Cavalry and the Struggle over Ottoman Kurdistan, 1890-1914''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenian revolutionaries posed a threat because they were seen as disruptive, and they could work with the Russians against the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="newperspectivesonturkey.net"/&gt; The first Armenian revolutionary party was the [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]].&lt;ref name="hunchak.org.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunchak.org.au/aboutus/intro.html|title=Social Democrat Hunchakian Party|work=hunchak.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]] was made up of Armenian university students whose aim was "to create an independent Armenian state." &lt;ref name="hunchak.org.au"/&gt; The Hamidiye Light Cavalry was created to "combat local and cross-border challenges to Ottoman authority." &lt;ref&gt;Janet Klein, Joost Jongerden, Jelle Verheij, ''Social Relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870-1975'', 172&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest patron of the Hamidieh was [[Abdul Hamid II]]. He wanted to create a relationship of commitment and loyalty with the [[Kurds]] that were chosen to make up the Hamidiye Cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Berg, Simon Wendt, Globalizing Lynching History: Vigilantism and Extralegal Punishment from an International Perspective, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamidieh was divided into groups according to age: the ''ibtidaiye'' (ages 17–20), the ''nizamiye'' (age 20-32), and the ''redif'' (age 32-40).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; An Ottoman diplomat, close advisor to the sultan, and contributor to the creation of the Hamidiye Light Cavalry was [[Sakir Pasa]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Janet Klein, Joost Jongerden, Jelle Verheij, ''Social Relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870-1975'', 151&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the Russians forged relationships with Armenian revolutionaries, and with [[Kurdistan|Kurdish]] tribal leaders.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Ottoman Empire understood the threat this created and is in large part why they chose the Kurds to make-up the Hamidieh{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}. The Kurdish population could potentially unite with the Russians, but with the formation of the Hamidieh they would protect the frontiers of the Ottoman Empire {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}. Some argue that the creation of the Hamidieh "further antagonized the Armenian population" and it worsened the very conflict they were created to prevent.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Janet Klein, Joost Jongerden, Jelle Verheij, ''Social Relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870-1975'', 152&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamidieh played a huge rule in the [[Armenian Genocide]] and it was in largely responsible for the [[Hamidian Massacres]] that occurred from 1894-1896.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; They were told to take control of many lands populated by Armenians to weaken "internal enemies" along with the hidden agenda of eventually eliminating the Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''The Margins of the Empire'', 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Regions with high Armenian revolutionary actions were targets for the Hamidieh.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''The Margins of the Empire'', 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamidieh created an "Armenian Conspiracy" to justify their reasons for killing the Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Klein, Joost Jongerden, Jelle Verheij, ''Social Relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870-1975'', 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hamidieh shaped the "social, economic, and political transformations" in Kurdish societies.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Klein, Joost Jongerden, Jelle Verheij, ''Social Relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870-1975'', 154&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamidieh received several benefits for their participation. They were able to seize much of the lands they destroyed, whether lawful or not.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Klein, ''The Margins of the Empire'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamidieh were protected during their annual migrations (periods when they took care of their livestock).&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; They were supplied with the most advanced weapons from the state, and were given armed escorts.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The Hamidieh stole money from the villages they plundered without fear of government sanction.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Klein, Joost Jongerden, Jelle Verheij, ''Social Relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870-1975'', 160&lt;/ref&gt; Another important on-site commissioner of the Hamidieh was [[Zeki Pasha]], who was connected to the sultan through marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''The Margins of the Empire'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Zeki Pasha was given the task of collecting sufficient taxes in order to recruit the Kurdish into the Hamidieh. If one was a member of the Hamidieh and a crime was committed against you, the government would take immediate action to punish the criminals.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Klein, ''The Margins of the Empire'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The plunder, murder, and theft that the Hamidieh carried out went unpunished, but if a non-Hamidieh group did similar actions they were punished.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''The Margins of the Empire'', 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups who associated themselves with the Hamidieh received benefits as well, they rose in power with the money and land they acquired illegally.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''The Margins of the Empire'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hamidieh were not held responsible for their terrible actions. They were assured freedom of action in raids that involved non-Hamidieh parties.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The Hamidieh obtained wealth illegally with secret help from the Ottoman government.  The corruption, chaos, and destruction caused by the Hamidieh is a direct cause of their lack of order and control. No guidelines in the Hamidieh cavalry led some of its members to not be a part of the indulgences that came with the corruption. Ottoman soldiers described the some Hamidieh as "miserable, hungry, and sometimes poorly clothed."&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''The Margins of the Empire'', 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamidieh's performance was due to their "lack of professionalism superimposed on an emotionally charged mission requiring highly disciplined troops."&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Erickson, Defeat in Detail: The Ottoman Army in the Balkans, 1912-1913, 14&lt;/ref&gt; The cavalry was not prepared for all they were intended to do because they were not trained properly and based their raids on anti-Armenian ideologies. These factors led to the slow disintegration of the Hamidieh.

== Armenian and Assyrian persecution/genocide by Hamidieh units ==
The Hamidieh units also participated in the persecution and slaughter of Armenians between 1894 and 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eppel|first1=Michael|title=A People Without a State: The Kurds from the Rise of Islam to the Dawn of Nationalism, page 83|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9781477311073|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some estimates, about ten to twenty thousand Armenians were slaughtered by the Hamidieh units.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Edmondson Ramsaur, Jr. The Young Turks: Prelude to the Revolution of 1908, Beirut, Khayats, 1965, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Janet Klein, Hamidye units were involved in the large scale massacres and violence against Armenians in the period 1894-96 and 1915, and they were also "implicated in mass murder, deportation and looting" during the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Janet. The Margins of Empire: Kurdish Militias in the Ottoman Tribal Zone. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richar G. Hovannisian an Armenian-American, the Turkish armed forces and Hamidieh units slaughtered Assyrians in the Tur Abdin region in 1915. It is estimated that ten thousand Assyrians were killed, and according to a document from the same years, "the skulls of small children were smashed with rocks, the bodies of girls and women who resisted rape were chopped into pieces live, men were mostly beheaded, and the clergy skinned or burnt alive".&lt;ref&gt;The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies, Richard G. Hovannisian, Transaction Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uniforms==
The uniform ranking system was based on the 1861 patterns of cuff chevrons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ottoman-uniforms.com/ottoman-hamidiye-corps-1890-till-1908/&lt;/ref&gt; Several ceremonies took place to for the Hamidieh where they wore elegant uniforms showing their ranks and accomplishments. The new uniforms were to take the place of the colorful uniforms previously worn by the Kurds.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Klein, ''The Margins of the Empire'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to create an identity for the Hamidieh who were spread across the frontiers of the empire.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; They sometimes consisted of grey tunics or waist-belts, grey trousers with a narrow red stripe, and [[kalpak]] with the imperial arms.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''The Margins of the Empire'', 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The uniforms slightly varied depending on the region the Hamidieh was located.

==Units==
The Hamidiye Regiments were stationed in the following towns and villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{tr icon}} Avyarov. ''Osmanlı-Rus ve İran Savaşlar'ında Kürtler 1801-1900'' [The Kurds in the Ottoman-Russian and -Iranian Wars, 1801-1900]. Ankara: SİPAN, 1995, {{oclc|38764140}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of the Jews in Poland''' dates back over 1,000 years. For centuries, [[Poland]] was home to the largest and most significant [[Jew]]ish community in the world. Poland was a principal center of [[Jewish culture]], thanks to a long period of statutory [[toleration|religious tolerance]] and [[Qahal|social autonomy]]. This ended with the [[Partitions of Poland]] which began in 1772, in particular, with the discrimination and [[persecution of Jews in the Russian Empire]]. During [[World War II]] there was a nearly complete [[genocide|genocidal]] destruction of the Polish Jewish community by [[Nazi Germany]] and its collaborators, during the 1939–1945 [[German occupation of Poland]] and the ensuing [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Since the [[fall of communism in Poland]], there has been a [[Jewish Polish history (1989–present)|Jewish revival]], featuring an annual [[Jewish Culture Festival]], new study programs at Polish secondary schools and universities, the work of [[synagogue]]s such as the [[Nożyk Synagogue]], and [[Warsaw]]'s [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]].

From the founding of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1025 through to the early years of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] [[Union of Lublin|created in 1569]], [[Poland]] was the most tolerant country in Europe.&lt;ref name="Hugh"/&gt; Known as ''[[Heaven for the nobles, Purgatory for the townspeople, Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews|paradisus iudaeorum]]'' ([[Latin]] for "[[Paradise]] of the Jews"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polin.pl/en/wystawy-wystawa-glowna-galerie/paradisus-iudaeorum Paradisus Iudaeorum (1569–1648), Museum of the History of Polish Jews]&lt;/ref&gt; it became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world's largest Jewish community of the time. According to some sources, about three-quarters of the world's Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EJC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="relations"/&gt; With the weakening of the Commonwealth and growing religious strife (due to the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Counter-Reformation]]), Poland's traditional tolerance&lt;ref name="Central"/&gt; began to wane from the 17th century onward.&lt;ref name="Note"/&gt; After the [[Partitions of Poland]] in 1795 and the destruction of Poland as a [[sovereign state]], Polish Jews were subject to the laws of the partitioning powers, the increasingly [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] [[Russian Empire]],&lt;ref name="partners-1"/&gt; as well as [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later a part of the [[German Empire]]). Still, as Poland regained independence in the [[aftermath of World War I]], it was the center of the European Jewish world with one of the world's largest Jewish communities of over 3 million.

===Early history: 966–1385===
{{Main|History of Poland (966-1385)}}
The first Jews arrived in the territory of modern Poland in the 10th century.  Travelling along trade routes leading east to [[Kiev]] and [[Bukhara]], Jewish merchants, known as [[Radhanites]], crossed [[Silesia]]. One of them, a diplomat and merchant from the [[Moors|Moorish]] town of [[Tortosa]] in Spanish [[Al-Andalus]], known by his Arabic name, [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub]], was the first chronicler to mention the Polish state ruled by Prince [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]].  In the summer of 965 or 966 Jacob made a trade and diplomatic journey from his native [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in Muslim Spain to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and to Slavic countries.&lt;ref name=polishjews.org&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  The first actual mention of Jews in Polish chronicles occurs in the 11th century. It appears that Jews were then living in [[Gniezno]], at that time the capital of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Polish kingdom]] of the [[Piast dynasty]]. Among the first Jews to arrive in Poland (in 1097 or 1098) were those banished from [[Prague]].&lt;ref name=polishjews.org/&gt; The first permanent Jewish community is mentioned in 1085 by a Jewish scholar [[Yehuda ben Meir|Jehuda ha-Kohen]] in the city of [[Przemyśl]].&lt;ref name="PMH-1"/&gt;

As elsewhere in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], the principal activity of Jews in [[medieval Poland]] was commerce and trade, including export and import of goods such as cloth, linen, furs, hides, wax, metal objects, and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Trade|title=YIVO {{!}} Trade|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PolishHebrewCoins1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Early-medieval Polish coins with Hebrew inscriptions]]

The first extensive Jewish emigration from [[Western Europe]] to Poland occurred at the time of the [[First Crusade]] in 1098. Under [[Boleslaus III of Poland|Bolesław III]] (1102–1139), the Jews, encouraged by the tolerant regime of this ruler, settled throughout Poland, including over the border in [[Lithuania]]n territory as far as [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Friedman |first = Jonathan C |title = Routledge History of the Holocaust |chapter = Jewish Communities of Europe on the Eve of World War II |origyear = 2011 |year = 2012 |publisher = Routledge |location = Abingdon; New York |isbn = 978-0-415-52087-4 |page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolesław III recognized the utility of Jews in the development of the [[commerce|commercial interests]] of his country. Jews came to form the backbone of the Polish economy. [[Mieszko III of Poland|Mieszko III]] employed Jews in his mint as engravers and technical supervisors, and the [[Bracteates|coins]] minted during that period even bear [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebraic markings]].&lt;ref name=polishjews.org/&gt; Jews worked on commission for the mints of other contemporary Polish princes, including [[Casimir the Just]], [[Bolesław I the Tall]] and [[Władysław III Spindleshanks]].&lt;ref name=polishjews.org/&gt; Jews enjoyed undisturbed peace and prosperity in the many principalities into which the country was then divided; they formed the middle class in a country where the general population consisted of [[landlord]]s (developing into ''[[szlachta]]'', the unique Polish nobility) and peasants, and they were instrumental in promoting the commercial interests of the land.

Another factor for the Jews to emigrate to Poland were the [[Magdeburg rights]], or Magdeburg Law, a charter given to the Jews, among others, that specifically outlined the rights and privileges that Jews had coming into Poland. For example, they could define their neighborhoods and economic competitors and set up monopolies. This made it very attractive for Jewish communities to pick up and move to Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishhistorylectures.org/2013/12/05/origins-of-polish-jewry-this-week-in-jewish-history/ Origins of Polish Jewry (This Week in Jewish History) « Henry Abramson, PhD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Gesta principum Polonorum]]'' states that Princess [[Judith of Bohemia]],  wife of Polish Prince [[Władysław I Herman]] ''ransomed many Christians with her own money from the bondage of the Jews''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Żbikowki, Żydzi, Wrocław 1997, s. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of Jewish settlers in [[Płock]] dates from 1237, in Kalisz from 1287 and a Zydowska (Jewish) street in Kraków in 1304.&lt;ref name=polishjews.org/&gt;

The tolerant situation was gradually altered by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on the one hand, and by the neighboring German states on the other.&lt;ref name="Dubnow-1"/&gt; There were, however, among the reigning princes some determined protectors of the Jewish inhabitants, who considered the presence of the latter most desirable as far as the economic development of the country was concerned. Prominent among such rulers was [[Bolesław the Pious]] of [[Kalisz]], Prince of [[Great Poland]]. With the consent of the class representatives and higher officials, in 1264 he issued a General Charter of Jewish Liberties, the [[Statute of Kalisz]], which granted all Jews the freedom of worship, trade and travel. Similar privileges were granted to the Silesian Jews by the local princes, Prince Henry Probus of Wrocław in 1273–90, Henry of Glogow in 1274 and 1299, Henry of Legnica in 1290 – 95 and Bolko of Legnica and Wrocław in 1295.&lt;ref name=polishjews.org/&gt;

During the next hundred years, the Church pushed for the persecution of the Jews while the rulers of Poland usually protected them.&lt;ref name="Dubnow-2"/&gt; The Councils of Wrocław (1267), Buda (1279), and Łęczyca (1285) each segregated Jews, ordered them to wear a special emblem, banned them from holding offices where Christians would be subordinated to them, and forbade them from building more than one prayer house in each town. However, those church decrees required the cooperation of the Polish princes for enforcement, which was generally not forthcoming, due to the profits which the Jews' economic activity yielded to the princes.&lt;ref name=polishjews.org/&gt;
[[File:Wojciech Gerson, Przyjęcie Żydów.jpg|thumb|[[Wojciech Gerson]], ''Reception of Jews, Casimir the Great and Jews'']]
In 1332, King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]] (1303–1370) amplified and expanded Bolesław's old charter with the [[Wiślicki Statute]]. Under his reign, streams of Jewish immigrants headed east to Poland and Jewish settlements are first mentioned as existing in [[Lviv|Lvov]] (1356), [[Sandomierz]] (1367), and Kazimierz near Kraków (1386).&lt;ref name=polishjews.org/&gt; Casimir, who according to a legend had a Jewish lover named [[Esterka]] from [[Opoczno]]&lt;ref name="opoczno-1"/&gt; was especially friendly to the Jews, and his reign is regarded as an era of great prosperity for Polish Jewry, and was nicknamed by his contemporaries "King of the [[serf]]s and Jews." Under [[penalty of death]], he prohibited the kidnapping of Jewish children for the purpose of enforced [[Christianity|Christian]] [[baptism]]. He inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of [[Jewish]] [[cemeteries]]. Nevertheless, while for the greater part of Casimir’s reign the Jews of Poland enjoyed tranquility, toward its close they were subjected to persecution on account of the [[Black Death]]. In 1348, the first [[Blood libel against Jews|blood libel]] accusation against Jews in Poland was recorded, and in 1367 the first pogrom took place in [[Poznań]] (Posen).&lt;ref name="Poznan-1"/&gt;&lt;!-- 2008 {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} edited out --&gt; Compared with the pitiless destruction of their co-religionists in [[Western Europe]], however, the Polish Jews did not fare badly; and the Jewish masses of Germany fled to the more hospitable cities in Poland.

===The early Jagiellon era: 1385–1505===
{{main article|History of Poland (1385–1569)}}
As a result of the marriage of [[Jogaila|Wladislaus II]] (Jagiełło) to [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], daughter of [[Louis I of Hungary]], Lithuania was [[Polish–Lithuanian Union|united with the kingdom of Poland]]. In {{nowrap|1388–1389}}, broad privileges were extended to [[Lithuanian Jews]] including freedom of religion and commerce on equal terms with the Christians.&lt;ref name="Dubnow-3"/&gt; Under the rule of Wladislaus II, Polish Jews had increased in numbers and attained prosperity. However, religious persecution gradually increased, as the dogmatic clergy pushed for less official tolerance, pressured by the [[Jan Hus#Council of Constance|Synod of Constance]]. In 1349 pogroms took place in many towns in Silesia.&lt;ref name=polishjews.org/&gt; There were accusations of [[blood libel]] by the priests, and new riots against the Jews in Poznań in 1399. Accusations of blood libel by another fanatic priest led to the riots in [[Kraków]] in 1407, although the royal guard hastened to the rescue.&lt;ref name="Dubnow-3"/&gt; Hysteria caused by Black Death led to additional 14th-century outbreaks of violence against the Jews in [[Kalisz]], Kraków and [[Bochnia]]. Traders and artisans jealous of Jewish prosperity, and fearing their rivalry, supported the harassment. In 1423 the statute of Warka forbade Jews the granting of loans against letters of credit or mortgage and limited their operations exclusively to loans made on security of moveable property.&lt;ref name=polishjews.org/&gt; In the 14th and 15th centuries rich Jewish merchants and moneylenders leased the royal mint, salt mines and the collecting of customs and tolls. The most famous of them were Jordan and his son Lewko of Kraków in the 14th century and Jakub Slomkowicz of Luck, Wolczko of Drohobycz, Natko of Lvov, Samson of Zydaczow, Josko of Hrubieszow and Szania of Belz in the 15th century. For example, Wolczko of Drohobycz, King Ladislaus Jagiello's broker, was the owner of several villages in the Ruthenian voivodship and the soitys (administrator) of the village of Werbiz. Also Jews from Grodno were in this period owners of villages, manors, meadows, fish ponds and mills. However until the end of the 15th century agriculture as a source of income played only a minor role among Jewish families. More important were crafts for the needs of both their fellow Jews and the Christian population (fur making, tanning, tailoring).&lt;ref name=polishjews.org/&gt;
[[File:Casimir IV Jagiellon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] confirmed and extended Jewish charters in the second half of the 15th century]]

In 1454 anti-Jewish riots flared up in [[Bohemia]]'s ethnically-German [[Wrocław]] and other [[Silesia]]n cities, inspired by a Franciscan friar, [[John of Capistrano]], who accused Jews of profaning the Christian religion. As a result, Jews were banished from Lower Silesia. Zbigniew Olesnicki then invited John to conduct a similar campaign in Kraków and several other cities, to lesser effect. In 1495, Jews were ordered out of the center of Kraków and allowed to settle in the "Jewish town" of Kazimierz. In the same year, Alexander Jagiellon, following the example of Spanish rulers, banished the Jews from Lithuania. For several years they took shelter in Poland until they were allowed back to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1503.&lt;ref name=polishjews.org/&gt;

The decline in the status of the Jews was briefly checked by [[Casimir IV the Jagiellonian]] (1447–1492), but soon the nobility forced him to issue the [[Statute of Nieszawa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/67/556.html The Encyclopedia of World History 1447–92. 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228175637/http://www.bartleby.com/67/556.html |date=2008-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things it abolished the ancient privileges of the Jews "as contrary to divine right and the law of the land." Nevertheless, the king continued to offer his protection to the Jews. Two years later Casimir issued another document announcing that he could not deprive the Jews of his benevolence on the basis of "the principle of tolerance which in conformity with God's laws obliged him to protect them".&lt;ref name="bdw50"/&gt; The policy of the government toward the Jews of Poland oscillated under [[Casimir IV the Jagiellonian|Casimir's]] sons and successors, [[John I Albert]] (1492–1501) and [[Alexander the Jagiellonian]] (1501–1506). The latter decreed in 1495 to expel the Jews from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] when he was the Grand Duke of Lithuania but reversed his decision eight years later in 1503 after becoming King of Poland. The next year he issued a proclamation in which he stated that a policy of tolerance befitted "kings and rulers".&lt;ref name=bdw50/&gt;

===Center of the Jewish world: 1505–72===
[[File:Zugmunt August crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sigismund II Augustus]] followed in the tolerant policy of his [[Sigismund I the Old|father]] and also granted autonomy to the Jews.]]
Poland became more tolerant just as the [[Alhambra Decree|Jews were expelled from Spain]] in 1492, as well as from [[Jews in Austria|Austria]], [[Hungarian Jews|Hungary]] and [[Jews in Germany|Germany]], thus stimulating Jewish immigration to the much more accessible Poland. Indeed, with the expulsion of the [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews from Spain]], Poland became the recognized haven for exiles from Western Europe; and the resulting accession to the ranks of Polish Jewry made it the cultural and spiritual center of the Jewish people.

The most prosperous period for Polish Jews began following this new influx of Jews with the reign of [[Sigismund I the Old]] (1506–1548), who protected the Jews in his realm. His son, [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (1548–1572), mainly followed in the tolerant policy of his father and also granted autonomy to the Jews in the matter of communal administration and laid the foundation for the power of the ''[[Qahal]]'', or autonomous Jewish community. This period led to the creation of a proverb about Poland being a "heaven for the Jews". According to some sources, about three-quarters of all Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Sanford/&gt;&lt;ref name=EJC/&gt;&lt;ref name="relations"/&gt; In the middle of the 16th century, Poland welcomed the Jewish newcomers from [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]], mostly of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] origin. However, some of the immigrants from the [[Ottoman Empire]] are still considered [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahim]]. Jewish religious life thrived in many Polish communities. In 1503, the Polish monarchy appointed Rabbi [[Jacob Pollak]], the official Rabbi of Poland, marking the emergence of the Chief Rabbinate. By 1551, Jews were given permission to choose their own Chief Rabbi. The Chief Rabbinate held power over law and finance, appointing judges and other officials. Some power was shared with local councils. The Polish government permitted the Rabbinate to grow in power, to use it for tax collection purposes. Only 30% of the money raised by the Rabbinate served Jewish causes, the rest went to the Crown for protection. In this period Poland-Lithuania became the main center for Ashkenazi Jewry and its ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' achieved fame from the early 16th century.

[[Moses Isserles]] (1520–1572), an eminent [[Talmud]]ist of the 16th century, established his [[yeshiva]] in [[Kraków]]. In addition to being a renowned Talmudic and [[halakha|legal scholar]], Isserles was also learned in [[Kabbalah]], and studied history, astronomy, and philosophy. The [[Remuh Synagogue]] was built for him in 1557. ''Rema'' (רמ״א) is the Hebrew acronym for his name.&lt;ref name="Remuh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracow-life.com/guide/Krakow_Kazimierz/Remuh_Synagogue.php|title=Remuh Synagogue.

After the childless death of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], the last king of the [[Jagiellon dynasty]], Polish and Lithuanian nobles ([[szlachta]]) gathered at [[Warsaw]] in 1573 and signed a document in which representatives of all major religions pledged mutual support and tolerance. The following eight or nine decades of material prosperity and relative security experienced by Polish Jews – wrote Professor [[Gershon Hundert]] – witnessed the appearance of "a virtual galaxy of sparkling intellectual figures." Jewish academies were established in Lublin, Kraków, Brześć (Brisk), Lwów, Ostróg and other towns.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|p=11}} Poland-Lithuania was the only country in Europe where the Jews cultivated their own farmer's fields.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|p=19}}

===The Cossack uprising and the Deluge===
In 1648 the Commonwealth was devastated by several conflicts, in which the country lost over a third of its population (over three million people). The Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands. The first of these large-scale atrocities was the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]], in which [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s [[Cossack]]s massacred tens of thousands of Jews and Catholic Poles in the eastern and southern areas he controlled (today's Ukraine).&lt;ref&gt;Herman Rosenthal, [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=469&amp;letter=C "Chmielnicki, Bogdan Zinovi"], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; The precise number of dead is not known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during this period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and ''[[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|jasyr]]'' (captivity in the [[Ottoman Empire]]). The Jewish community suffered greatly during the 1648 Cossack uprising which had been directed primarily against the Polish nobility. The Jews, perceived as allies of the nobles, were also victims of the revolt, during which about 20% of them were killed.

Ruled by the elected kings of the [[House of Vasa]] since 1587, the embattled Commonwealth was invaded by the [[Swedish Empire]] in 1655 in what became known as [[Deluge (history)|the Deluge]]. The kingdom of Poland which had already suffered from the Chmielnicki Uprising and from the recurring invasions of the Russians, [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], became the scene of even more atrocities. [[Charles X of Sweden]], at the head of his victorious army, overran the cities of Kraków and Warsaw. The amount of destruction, pillage and methodical plunder during the [[Siege of Kraków (1657)]] was so enormous that parts the city never again recovered. The Polish general [[Stefan Czarniecki]] defeated the Swedes in 1660. He was equally successful in his battles against the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nagielski |first=Mirosław |year=1995 |title=Hetmani Rzeczypospolitej Obojga Narodów |chapter=Stefan Czarniecki (1604–1655) hetman polny |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t4niAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Wydawn.

As soon as the disturbances had ceased, the Jews began to return and to rebuild their destroyed homes; and while it is true that the Jewish population of Poland had decreased, it still was more numerous than that of the Jewish colonies in Western Europe. Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews. It also should be noted that while Jewish losses in those events were high, estimated by some historians to be close to 500,000, {{Fact?|date=July 2018}} the Commonwealth lost one third of its population — approximately three million of its citizens.
[[File:PolishJews3.jpg|thumb|upright|A Jewish couple in Poland, around 1765.]]

The environment of the Polish Commonwealth – wrote Professor Gershon Hundert – profoundly affected Jews due to genuinely positive encounter with the Christian culture across the many cities and towns owned by the Polish aristocracy. There was no isolation.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51–52}} The Jewish dress resembled that of their Polish neighbor. "Reports of romances, of drinking together in taverns, and of intellectual conversations are quite abundant." Wealthy Jews had Polish noblemen at their table, and served meals on silver plates.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51–52}} By 1764, there were about 750,000 Jews in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The worldwide Jewish population at that time was estimated at 1.2 million. In 1768 the [[Koliyivshchyna]] rebellion west of the Dnieper river in Volhynia led to ferocious murders of Polish noblemen, Catholic priests and thousands of Jews.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=17–18}} Four years later, in 1772, the military [[Partitions of Poland]] had begun between Russia, Prussia and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/articles/item/timeline_jewish_life_in_poland_from_1098_20070608/ "Timeline: Jewish life in Poland from 1098"], Jewish Journal, June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The development of Judaism in Poland and the Commonwealth==
The culture and intellectual output of the Jewish community in Poland had a profound impact on Judaism as a whole. Some Jewish historians have recounted that the word Poland is pronounced as ''Polania'' or ''Polin'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and as [[transliteration|transliterated]] into Hebrew, these names for Poland were interpreted as "good omens" because ''Polania'' can be broken down into three Hebrew words: ''po'' ("here"), ''lan'' ("dwells"), ''ya'' ("[[Names of God in Judaism|God]]"), and ''Polin'' into two words of: ''po'' ("here") ''lin'' ("[you should] dwell"). The "message" was that Poland was meant to be a good place for the Jews. During the time from the rule of [[Sigismund I the Old]] until the Nazi [[Holocaust]], Poland would be at the center of Jewish religious life. Many agreed with Rabbi [[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Shemu’el ha-Levi]] (Taz) that Poland was a place where “most of the time the gentiles do no harm; on the contrary they do right by Israel” (''Divre David;'' 1689).&lt;ref&gt;[[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Samuel Ha-Levi]], "Divre ̄ David Ture ̄ Zahav" (1689) in Hebrew.

''[[Yeshiva|Yeshivot]]'' were established, under the direction of the rabbis, in the more prominent communities. Such schools were officially known as [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], and their rabbi principals as [[Rector (academia)|rectors]]. Important ''yeshivot'' existed in Kraków, Poznań, and other cities. Jewish printing establishments came into existence in the first quarter of the 16th century. In 1530 a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Pentateuch]] ([[Torah]]) was printed in Kraków; and at the end of the century the Jewish printing houses of that city and [[Lublin]] issued a large number of Jewish books, mainly of a religious character. The growth of [[Talmud|Talmudic scholarship]] in Poland was coincident with the greater prosperity of the Polish Jews; and because of their communal autonomy educational development was wholly one-sided and along Talmudic lines. Exceptions are recorded, however, where Jewish youth sought secular instruction in the European universities. The learned rabbis became not merely expounders of the Law, but also spiritual advisers, teachers, judges, and legislators; and their authority compelled the communal leaders to make themselves familiar with the abstruse questions of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. Polish Jewry found its views of life shaped by the spirit of Talmudic and rabbinical literature, whose influence was felt in the home, in school, and in the synagogue.

In the first half of the 16th century the seeds of Talmudic learning had been transplanted to Poland from [[Bohemia]], particularly from the school of [[Jacob Pollak]], the creator of ''[[Pilpul]]'' ("sharp reasoning"). [[Shalom Shachna]] (c. 1500–1558), a pupil of Pollak, is counted among the pioneers of Talmudic learning in Poland. He lived and died in [[Lublin]], where he was the head of the ''yeshivah'' which produced the rabbinical celebrities of the following century. Shachna's son Israel became rabbi of Lublin on the death of his father, and Shachna's pupil [[Moses Isserles]] (known as the ''ReMA'') (1520–1572) achieved an international reputation among the Jews as the co-author of the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', (the "Code of Jewish Law"). His contemporary and correspondent [[Solomon Luria]] (1510–1573) of Lublin also enjoyed a wide reputation among his co-religionists; and the authority of both was recognized by the Jews throughout Europe. Heated religious disputations were common, and Jewish scholars participated in them. At the same time, the ''[[Kabbalah]]'' had become entrenched under the protection of [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinism]]; and such scholars as [[Mordecai Jaffe]] and [[Yoel Sirkis]] devoted themselves to its study. This period of great Rabbinical scholarship was interrupted by the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] and [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]].

===The rise of Hasidism===
[[File:Jakub Frank.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Frank]]]]
{{main article|Hasidic Judaism}}
The decade from the [[Chmielnicki Uprising|Cossacks' uprising]] until after the [[The Deluge (Polish history)|Swedish war]] (1648–1658) left a deep and lasting impression not only on the social life of the Polish-Lithuanian Jews, but on their spiritual life as well. The intellectual output of the Jews of Poland was reduced. The Talmudic learning which up to that period had been the common possession of the majority of the people became accessible to a limited number of students only. What religious study there was became overly formalized, some rabbis busied themselves with quibbles concerning religious laws; others wrote commentaries on different parts of the Talmud in which hair-splitting arguments were raised and discussed; and at times these arguments dealt with matters which were of no practical importance. At the same time, many miracle workers made their appearance among the Jews of Poland, culminating in a series of false "Messianic" movements, most famously as [[Sabbatai Zevi|Sabbatianism]] was succeeded by [[Jacob Frank|Frankism]].

In this time of [[mysticism]] and overly formal rabbinism came the teachings of [[Israel ben Eliezer]], known as the ''Baal Shem Tov'', or ''BeShT'', (1698–1760), which had a profound effect on the Jews of [[Eastern Europe]] and Poland in particular. His disciples taught and encouraged the new fervent brand of [[Judaism]] based on ''[[Kabbalah]]'' known as [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. The rise of Hasidic Judaism within Poland's borders and beyond had a great influence on the rise of [[Haredi Judaism]] all over the world, with a continuous influence through its many [[List of Hasidic dynasties|Hasidic dynasties]] including those of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Aleksander]], [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]], [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], [[Nadvorna (Hasidic dynasty)|Nadvorna]], among others.

==The Partitions of Poland==
[[File:Jewish dress in Poland 17th and 18th century.jpg|thumb|upright|Jewish dress in 17th ''(top)'' and 18th centuries]]
Disorder and anarchy reigned supreme in Poland during the second half of the 18th century, from the accession to the throne of its last king, [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski]] in 1764. His election was bought by [[Catherine the Great]] for 2.5 million rubles, with the Russian army stationing only three miles away from Warsaw.&lt;ref name="Szyndler-64"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KpBxHzAB1gC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Racławice 1794 |publisher=Bellona |year=2009 |accessdate=26 September 2014 |author=Bartłomiej Szyndler |pages=64–65 |isbn=9788311116061}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later, triggered by the [[Confederation of Bar]] against the Russian influence and the pro-Russian king, the outlying provinces of Poland were overrun from all sides by different military forces and divided for the first time by the three neighboring empires, Russia, [[Austria]], and [[Prussia]].&lt;ref name="Szyndler-64"/&gt; The Commonwealth lost 30% of its land during the [[First Partition of Poland|annexations of 1772]], and even more of its peoples.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|p=18}} Jews were most numerous in the territories that fell under the military control of Austria and Russia.
[[File:Berek joselewicz.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Berek Joselewicz]] (1764–1809)]]

The permanent council established at the instance of the Russian government (1773–1788) served as the highest administrative tribunal, and occupied itself with the elaboration of a plan that would make practicable the reorganization of Poland on a more rational basis. The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous ''[[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]]'' ("Commission of National Education"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One of the members of the commission, ''[[kanclerz]]'' [[Andrzej Zamoyski]], along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some ''szlachta'' and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the [[French Revolution]] of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.

A second [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]] was made on July 17, 1793. Jews, in a Jewish regiment led by [[Berek Joselewicz]], took part in the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] the following year, when the Poles tried to again achieve independence, but were brutally put down. Following the revolt, the third and final partition of Poland took place in 1795. The territories which included the great bulk of the Jewish population was transferred to Russia, and thus they became subjects of that empire, although in the first half of the 19th century some semblance of a vastly smaller Polish state was preserved, especially in the form of the [[Congress Poland]] (1815–1831).

Under foreign rule many Jews inhabiting formerly Polish lands were indifferent to Polish aspirations for independence. However, most Polonized Jews supported the revolutionary activities of Polish patriots and participated in national uprisings.&lt;ref name="OB"&gt;Olaf Bergmann (2015), ''Narodowa demokracja wobec problematyki żydowskiej w latach 1918–1929'', Poznań: Wydawnictwo Poznańskie, page 16. {{ISBN|978-83-7976-222-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish Jews took part in the November Insurrection of 1830–1831, the January Insurrection of 1863, as well as in the revolutionary movement of 1905. Many Polish Jews were enlisted in the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]], which fought for the Polish independence, achieved in 1918 when the occupying forces disintegrated following World War One.&lt;ref name="OB"/&gt;

[[File:Jewish merchants in XIX century Warsaw.PNG|thumb|Jewish merchants in 19th-century [[Warsaw]]]]
Official Russian policy would eventually prove to be substantially harsher to the Jews than that under independent Polish rule. The lands that had once been Poland were to remain the home of many Jews, as, in 1772, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], the ''Tzarina'' of Russia, instituted the [[Pale of Settlement]], restricting Jews to the western parts of the empire, which would eventually include much of Poland, although it excluded some areas in which Jews had previously lived. By the late 19th century, over four million Jews would live in the Pale.

Tsarist policy towards the Jews of Poland alternated between harsh rules, and inducements meant to break the resistance to large-scale conversion. In 1804, [[Alexander I of Russia]] issued a "Statute Concerning Jews",&lt;ref name="Alexander_I"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LzFd2W-C6BAC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Alexander+issued+a%22+%22Statute+Concerning+Jews%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5SFdT9PuKMqhgwfQwPmhCw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Alexander%20issued%20a%22%20%22Statute%20Concerning%20Jews%22&amp;f=false |title= The Cantonists: the Jewish children's army of the Tsar |publisher=Devora Publishing |year=2003 |accessdate=March 11, 2012 |first=Larry |last=Domnitch |page=11 |isbn=1-930143-85-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; meant to accelerate the process of assimilation of the Empire's new Jewish population. The Polish Jews were allowed to establish schools with Russian, German or Polish curricula. They could own land in the territories annexed from Poland. However, they were also restricted from leasing property, teaching in Yiddish, and from entering Russia. They were banned from the [[brewing industry]]. The harshest measures designed to compel Jews to merge into society at large called for their expulsion from small villages, forcing them to move into towns. Once the resettlement began, thousands of Jews lost their only source of income and turned to [[Qahal]] for support. Their living conditions in [[Pale of Settlement|the Pale]] began to dramatically worsen.&lt;ref name="Alexander_I"/&gt;

During the reign of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicolas I]], known by the Jews as "[[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the Second", hundreds of new anti-Jewish measures were enacted.&lt;ref name="Nicholas_I"/&gt; The 1827 decree by Nicolas – while lifting the traditional double taxation on Jews in lieu of army service – made Jews subject to general military recruitment laws that required Jewish communities to provide 7 recruits per each 1000 "souls" every 4 years. Unlike the general population that had to provide recruits between the ages of 18 and 35, Jews had to provide recruits between the ages of 12 and 25, at the [[qahal]]'s discretion. Thus between 1827 and 1857 over 30,000 children were placed in the so-called [[Cantonist]] schools, where they were pressured to convert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Jews_In_The_Russian_Army_1827_1917.html?id=9NoMdyNVtBYC |title=Jews in the Russian Army, 1827–1917: Drafted Into Modernity |author=Ĭokhanan Petrovskiĭ-Shtern |publisher=Cambridge University Press |via=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many children were smuggled to Poland, where the conscription of Jews did not take effect until 1844."&lt;ref name="Nicholas_I"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LzFd2W-C6BAC&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=%22Tsar%20Nicholas%20enacted%20hundreds%20of%20anti-Jewish%20measures.%22&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tsar%20Nicholas%20enacted%20hundreds%20of%20anti-Jewish%20measures.%22&amp;f=false |title=''The Cantonists: the Jewish children's army of the Tsar'' |year=2003 |accessdate=March 11, 2012 |first=Larry |last=Domnitch |pages=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pale of Settlement===
{{unsourced|section|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Map showing the percentage of Jews in the Pale of Settlement and Congress Poland, The Jewish Encyclopedia (1905).jpg|thumb|Map of [[Pale of Settlement]], showing Jewish population densities]]
The ''[[Pale of Settlement]]'' ({{lang-ru|Черта́ осе́длости}}, {{transl|ru|chertá osédlosti}}, {{lang-yi|תּחום-המושבֿ}}, {{transl|yi|tkhum-ha-moyshəv}}, {{lang-he|תְּחוּם הַמּוֹשָב}}, {{transl|he|tḥùm ha-mosháv}}) was the term given to a region of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] in which permanent residency by [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jews]] was allowed and beyond which Jewish permanent residency was generally prohibited.  It extended from the eastern ''pale'', or demarcation line, to the western Russian border with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later the [[German Empire]]) and with [[Austria-Hungary]].
The archaic English term ''pale'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[:wikt:palus#Latin|palus]]}}, a stake, extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.

With its large Catholic and Jewish populations, the Pale was acquired by the Russian Empire (which was a majority [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]) in a series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers between 1791 and 1835, and lasted until the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917. It comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and mostly corresponded to historical borders of the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; it covered much of present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Poland]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], and parts of western [[Russia]].

From 1791 to 1835, and until 1917, there were differing reconfigurations of the boundaries of the Pale, such that certain areas were variously open or shut to Jewish residency, such as the [[Caucasus]]. At times, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, as in [[Kiev]], [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]], excluded from residency at a number of cities within the Pale. Settlers from  outside the pale were forced to move to small towns, thus fostering the rise of the ''[[shtetl]]s''.

Although the Jews were accorded slightly more rights with the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]] by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], they were still restricted to the [[Pale of Settlement]] and subject to restrictions on ownership and profession. The existing [[status quo]] was shattered with the [[Alexander II of Russia#Assassination|assassination of Alexander]] in 1881 – an act falsely blamed upon the Jews.

===Pogroms in the Russian Empire===
[[File:Pogrom bialystok.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Russian Army]] assailant in 1906 [[Białystok pogrom]]]]
The assassination prompted a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots, called ''[[pogroms]]'' ({{lang-ru|погро́м}};) throughout 1881–1884. In the 1881 outbreak, pogroms were primarily limited to Russia, although in a riot in Warsaw two Jews were killed, 24 others were wounded, women were raped and over two million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] worth of property was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Porter, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k_g0ldP92ucC&amp;pg=PA162 When Nationalism Began to Hate: Imagining Modern Politics in Nineteenth-Century Poland]'', Oxford University Press (2000), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Dubnow]], ''History of the Jews in Russia and Poland'', Varda Books (2001 reprint), Vol. 2, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; The new czar, [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], blamed the Jews for the riots and issued a series of harsh restrictions on Jewish movements. Pogroms continued until 1884, with at least tacit government approval. They proved a turning point in the history of the Jews in [[partitioned Poland]] and throughout the world. In 1884, 36 Jewish [[Zionism|Zionist]] delegates [[Katowice Conference|met in Katowice]], forming the [[Hovevei Zion]] movement. The pogroms prompted a great wave of Jewish emigration to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Russia/Russian_Empire|title=Russian Empire|last=Stanislawski|first=Michael|website=YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An even bloodier wave of pogroms broke out from 1903 to 1906, at least some of them believed to have been organized by the Tsarist Russian secret police, the ''[[Okhrana]]''. They included the [[Białystok pogrom]] of 1906 in the [[Grodno Governorate]] of Russian Poland, in which at least 75 Jews were murdered by marauding soldiers and many more Jews were wounded. According to Jewish survivors, ethnic Poles did not participate in the pogrom and instead sheltered Jewish families.&lt;ref name="Bender16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSkendQVMbcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Poles%20refused%20to%20participate%22%20%22they%20had%20actually%20sheltered%20Jews%22&amp;f=false |title=Introduction: "Bialystock-upon-Tiktin" |publisher=UPNE |work=The Jews of Białystok During World War II and the Holocaust |date=2008 |accessdate=6 June 2015 |author=Sara Bender |pages=16 |ISBN=1584657294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haskalah and Halakha===
{{main article|Haskalah}}
{{unsourced|Section|date=July 2018}}
The Jewish Enlightenment, ''[[Haskalah]]'', began to take hold in Poland during the 19th century, stressing secular ideas and values. Champions of ''Haskalah'', the ''[[Haskalah|Maskilim]]'', pushed for assimilation and integration into Russian culture. At the same time, there was another school of Jewish thought that emphasized traditional study and a Jewish response to the ethical problems of antisemitism and persecution, one form of which was the [[Musar movement]]. Polish Jews generally were less influenced by ''Haskalah'', rather focusing on a strong continuation of their religious lives based on [[Halakha]] ("rabbis's law") following primarily [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Hasidic Judaism]], and also adapting to the new [[Religious Zionism]] of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement later in the 19th century.

===Politics in Polish territory===
[[File:ac.manif1917.jpg|thumb|A [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]]ist demonstration, 1917]]
By the late 19th century, ''Haskalah'' and the debates it caused created a growing number of political movements within the Jewish community itself, covering a wide range of views and vying for votes in local and regional elections. Zionism became very popular with the advent of the ''[[Poale Zion]]'' socialist party as well as the religious [[Polish Mizrahi]], and the increasingly popular [[General Zionists]]. Jews also took up [[socialism]], forming the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] [[labor union]] which supported assimilation and the [[rights of labor]]. The [[Folkspartei]] (People's Party) advocated, for its part, cultural autonomy and resistance to assimilation. In 1912, ''[[Agudat Israel]]'', a religious party, came into existence.

Many Jews took part in the Polish insurrections, particularly against Russia (since the Tsars discriminated heavily against the Jews). The [[Kościuszko Insurrection]], [[January Insurrection]] (1863) and [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolutionary Movement of 1905]] all saw significant Jewish involvement in the cause of Polish independence.

By the end of the 19th century, 14% of Polish citizens were Jewish. Jews participated in their religious communities, as well as local and federal government. There were several prominent Jewish politicians in the Polish Sejm, such as [[Apolinary Hartglas]] and [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]]. Many Jewish political parties were active, representing a wide ideological spectrum, from the Zionists, to the socialists to the anti-Zionists. One of the largest of these parties was the Bund, which was strongest in Warsaw and Lodz.

In addition to the socialists, Zionist parties were also popular, in particular, the Marxist [[Poale Zion]] and the orthodox religious Polish Mizrahi. The [[General Zionists|General Zionist]] party became the most prominent Jewish party in the interwar period and in the 1919 elections to the [[Polish legislative election, 1919|first Polish Sejm]] since the partitions, gained 50% of the Jewish vote.

In 1914, the German Zionist [[Max Bodenheimer]] founded the short-lived [[German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews]], with the goal of establishing a buffer state (''Pufferstaat'') within the Jewish Pale of Settlement, composed of the [[Partitions of Poland|former Polish provinces annexed by Russia]], being ''de facto'' [[protectorate]] of the [[German Empire]] that would free Jews in the region from Russian oppression. The plan, known as the [[League of East European States]], soon proved unpopular with both German officials and Bodenheimer's colleagues, and was dead by the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]].

In the aftermath of the Great War localized conflicts engulfed Eastern Europe between 1917 and 1919. Many attacks were launched against Jews during the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]], and the [[Polish–Soviet War]] ending with the [[Treaty of Riga]]. Almost half of the Jewish men perceived to have supported the [[Bolshevik Russia]] in these incidents were in their 20s.&lt;ref name="Piotrowski-41-42"/&gt; Just after the end of World War I, the West became alarmed by reports about alleged massive pogroms in Poland against Jews.

The number of Jews immigrating to Poland from Ukraine and Soviet Russia during the interwar period grew rapidly. Jewish population in the area of former [[Congress of Poland]] increased sevenfold between 1816 and 1921, from around 213,000 to roughly 1,500,000.&lt;ref&gt;Gershon David Hundert.

The average rate of permanent settlement was about 30,000 per annum. At the same time, every year around 100,000 Jews were passing through Poland in unofficial emigration overseas. Between the end of the [[Polish–Soviet War]] and late 1938, the Jewish population of the Republic had grown by over 464,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yehuda Bauer]], ''A History of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee 1929–1939.''

===Jewish and Polish culture===
{{main article|Jewish culture|Polish culture}}
[[File:Wielka Synagoga w Warszawie.JPG|thumb|[[Great Synagogue (Warsaw)|Warsaw Great Synagogue]]]]
The newly independent [[Second Polish Republic]] had a large and vibrant Jewish minority. By the time [[World War II]] began, Poland had the largest concentration of Jews in Europe although many Polish Jews had a separate culture and ethnic identity from Catholic Poles. Some authors have stated that only about 10% of Polish Jews during the interwar period could be considered "assimilated" while more than 80% could be readily recognized as Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Nechama Tec, "When Light Pierced the Darkness: Christian Rescue of Jews in Nazi-Occupied Poland", Oxford University Press US, 1987, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Kg0L3L0kImUC&amp;pg=PA12 p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Polish census of 1931|1931 National Census]] there were 3,130,581 Polish Jews measured by the declaration of their religion. Estimating the population increase and the emigration from Poland between 1931 and 1939, there were probably 3,474,000 Jews in Poland as of September 1, 1939 (approximately 10% of the total population) primarily centered in large and smaller cities: 77% lived in cities and 23% in the villages. They made up about 50%, and in some cases even 70% of the population of smaller towns, especially in Eastern Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.kalisz.pl/Statut/JewsWar2.htm Jews in Poland – Polish Jews in World War II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006072443/http://www.info.kalisz.pl/statut/jewswar2.htm |date=2008-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to World War II, the Jewish population of [[Łódź]] numbered about 233,000, roughly one-third of the city’s population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Lodz.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour – Lodz]&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Lwów]] (now in [[Ukraine]]) had the third largest Jewish population in Poland, numbering 110,000 in 1939 (42%). [[Wilno]] (now in [[Lithuania]]) had a Jewish community of nearly 100,000, about 45% of the city's total.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Vilnius.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour – Vilnius]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, [[Kraków]]'s Jewish population numbered over 60,000, or about 25% of the city's total population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/krakow/ Jewish Krakow: The Jews of Krakow.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 there were 375,000 Jews in [[Warsaw]] or one third of the city's population. Only New York City had more Jewish residents than Warsaw.

The major industries in which Polish Jews were employed were manufacturing and commerce. In many areas of the country, the majority of retail businesses were owned by Jews, who were sometimes among the wealthiest members of their communities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter D. Stachura]], ''Poland, 1918–1945: An Interpretive and Documentary History of the Second Republic'', Routledge (2004), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many Jews also worked as shoemakers and tailors, as well as in the liberal professions; doctors (56% of all doctors in Poland), teachers (43%), journalists (22%) and lawyers (33%).&lt;ref&gt;Iwo Cyprian Pogonowski, ''Jews in Poland: A Documentary History'', Hippocrene Books (1993), pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish youth and religious groups, diverse political parties and Zionist organizations, newspapers and theatre flourished. Jews owned land and real estate, participated in retail and manufacturing and in the export industry. Their religious beliefs spanned the range from Orthodox [[Hasidic Judaism]] to [[Reform Judaism|Liberal Judaism]].

The Polish language, rather than [[Yiddish]], was increasingly used by the young Warsaw Jews who did not have a problem in identifying themselves fully as Jews, Varsovians and Poles. Jews such as [[Bruno Schulz]] were entering the mainstream of Polish society, though many thought of themselves as a separate nationality within Poland. Most children were enrolled in Jewish religious schools, which used to limit their ability to speak Polish. As a result, according to the 1931 census, 79% of the Jews declared Yiddish as their first language, and only 12% listed Polish, with the remaining 9% being Hebrew.&lt;ref name="GUS1931"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://statlibr.stat.gov.pl/exlibris/aleph/a22_1/apache_media/VUNVGMLANSCQQFGYHCN3VDLK12A9U5.pdf |title=Drugi Powszechny Spis Ludności z dn. 9.XII.1931 r.

During the school year of 1937–1938 there were 226 elementary schools &lt;ref name="YV-archive2"/&gt; and twelve high schools as well as fourteen vocational schools with either [[Yiddish]] or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as the instructional language.  Jewish political parties, both the [[Socialist]] [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|General Jewish Labour Bund]] (The Bund), as well as parties of the Zionist right and left wing and religious conservative movements, were represented in the ''[[Sejm]]'' (the Polish Parliament) as well as in the regional councils.&lt;ref&gt;Yad Vashem, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090720013543/http://www1.yadvashem.org/Odot/prog/image_into.asp?id=7694&amp;lang=EN&amp;type_id=&amp;addr=%2FIMAGE_TYPE%2F7694.JPG  The Bund Council in August 1937, Warsaw, Poland.] Film and Photo Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Isaac Bashevis Singer (upright).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] (Polish: Izaak Zynger), achieved international acclaim as a classic Jewish writer and was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1978]]

The Jewish cultural scene &lt;ref&gt;Aleksander Hertz, Lucjan Dobroszycki [https://books.google.com/books?id=APRYwrQWy-AC&amp;dq=jews+in+polish+culture&amp;printsec=frontcover The Jews in Polish culture], Northwestern University Press, 1988 {{ISBN|0-8101-0758-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; was particularly vibrant in pre–World War II Poland, with numerous Jewish publications and more than one hundred periodicals. Yiddish authors, most notably [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], went on to achieve international acclaim as classic Jewish writers; Singer won the 1978 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Other Jewish authors of the period, such as [[Bruno Schulz]], [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Marian Hemar]], [[Emanuel Schlechter]] and [[Bolesław Leśmian]], as well as [[Konrad Tom]] and [[Jerzy Jurandot]], were less well-known internationally, but made important contributions to Polish literature. Some Polish writers had Jewish roots eg. [[Jan Brzechwa]] (a favorite poet of Polish children). Singer [[Jan Kiepura]], born of a Jewish mother and Polish father, was one of the most popular artists of that era, and pre-war songs of Jewish composers, including [[Henryk Wars]], [[Jerzy Petersburski]], [[Artur Gold]], [[Henryk Gold]], [[Zygmunt Białostocki]], [[Szymon Kataszek]] and [[Jakub Kagan]], are still widely known in Poland today. Painters became known as well for their depictions of Jewish life. Among them were [[Maurycy Gottlieb]], [[Artur Markowicz]], and [[Maurycy Trebacz]], with younger artists like [[Chaim Goldberg]] coming up in the ranks.

Scientist [[Leopold Infeld]], mathematician [[Stanislaw Ulam]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and professor [[Adam Ulam]] contributed to the world of science. Other Polish Jews who gained international recognition are [[Moses Schorr]], [[Ludwik Zamenhof]] (the creator of [[Esperanto]]), [[Georges Charpak]], [[Samuel Eilenberg]], [[Emanuel Ringelblum]], and [[Artur Rubinstein]], just to name a few from the long list. The term "[[genocide]]" was coined by [[Rafał Lemkin]] (1900–1959), a Polish-Jewish legal scholar. [[Leonid Hurwicz]] was awarded the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Economics]]. The [[YIVO]] (Jidiszer Wissenszaftlecher Institute) Scientific Institute was based in Wilno before transferring to New York during the war. In Warsaw, important centers of Judaic scholarship, such the [[Main Judaic Library]] and the Institute of Judaic Studies were located, along with numerous Talmudic Schools (Jeszybots), religious centers and synagogues, many of which were of high architectural quality. [[Yiddish theatre]] also flourished; Poland had fifteen Yiddish theatres and theatrical groups. Warsaw was home to the most important Yiddish theater troupe of the time, the [[Vilna Troupe]], which staged the first performance of ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' in 1920 at the Elyseum Theatre. Some future Israeli leaders studied at [[University of Warsaw]], including [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Yitzhak Shamir]].

There also were several Jewish sports clubs, with some of them, such as [[Hasmonea Lwow]] and [[Jutrzenka Kraków]], winning promotion to the [[Ekstraklasa|Polish First Football League]]. A Polish-Jewish footballer, [[Józef Klotz]], scored the first ever goal for the [[Poland national football team]]. Another athlete, [[Alojzy Ehrlich]], won several medals in the table-tennis tournaments.

===Tensions and antisemitism===
An ever-increasing proportion of Jews in [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]] lived separate lives from the Polish majority. In 1921, 74.2% of Polish Jews listed [[Yiddish]] or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as their native language; the number rose to 87% by 1931,&lt;ref name="GUS1931"/&gt; contributing to growing tensions between Jews and Poles.&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Prizel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fE2quB852jcC&amp;pg=PA65 ''National identity and foreign policy''], Cambridge University Press 1998 {{ISBN|0-521-57697-0}} p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were often not identified as Polish nationals, a problem caused not only by the reversal of assimilation shown in national censuses between 1921 and 1931, but also by the influx of Russian Jews escaping persecution—especially in Ukraine, where up to 2,000 pogroms took place during the Civil War, an estimated 30,000 Jews were massacred directly, and a total of 150,000 died.&lt;ref&gt;Sharman Kadish, Bolsheviks and British Jews: The Anglo-Jewish Community, Britain, and the Russian Revolution. Published by Routledge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhkA1VpX5KQC&amp;pg=RA5-PA87 p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gitelman"/&gt; A large number of Russian Jews emigrated to Poland, as they were entitled by the [[Peace of Riga|Peace treaty of Riga]] to choose the country they preferred. Several hundred thousand refugees joined the already numerous Jewish minority of the [[Polish Second Republic]]. The resulting economic instability was mirrored by anti-Jewish sentiment in some of the media; discrimination, exclusion, and violence at the universities; and the appearance of "anti-Jewish squads" associated with some of the right-wing political parties. These developments contributed to a greater support among the Jewish community for Zionist and socialist ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Engelking Boni, "Psychological Distance Between Poles and Jews in Nazi-Occupied Warsaw", in Joshue Zimmerman, ed., "Contested memories", Rutgers University Press, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uHJyoGiep2gC&amp;printsec=frontcover p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=103153008 Contested Memories: Poles and Jews during the Holocaust and Its Aftermath].

Notably, the "campaign for Jewish emigration was predicated not on antisemitism but on objective social and economic factors".&lt;ref&gt;Emanuel Melzer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=co3KJikOaBYC&amp;pg=PA132 ''No way out: the politics of Polish Jewry, 1935–1939''] p. 132. Hebrew Union College Press. 1997 – 235 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; However, regardless of these changing economic and social conditions, the increase in antisemitic activity in prewar Poland was also typical of antisemitism found in other parts of Europe at that time, developing within a broader, continent-wide pattern with counterparts in every other European country.&lt;ref name="Szaynok277"/&gt;

Matters improved for a time under the rule of [[Józef Piłsudski]] (1926–1935), who opposed [[antisemitism]]. Piłsudski countered [[Endecja]]'s '[[polonization|ethnic assimilation]]' with the 'state assimilation' policy: citizens were judged by their loyalty to the state, not by their nationality.&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt; The years 1926–1935 were favourably viewed by many Polish Jews, whose situation improved especially under the cabinet of Pilsudski’s appointee [[Kazimierz Bartel]].&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"/&gt; However, a combination of various factors, including the [[Great Depression]],&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt; meant that the situation of Jewish Poles was never very satisfactory, and it deteriorated again after Piłsudski's death in May 1935, which many Jews regarded as a tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidhorodok.tripod.com/4a.html |title=DavidGorodok – Section IV – a |publisher=Davidhorodok.tripod.com |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish industries were negatively affected by the development of mass production and the advent of department stores offering ready-made products. The traditional sources of livelihood for the estimated 300,000 Jewish family-run businesses in the country began to vanish, contributing to a growing trend toward isolationism and internal self-sufficiency.&lt;ref name="WM"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prof. Włodzimierz Mędrzecki, [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] PAN |title=Żydzi w historii Polski XIX i XX wieku |trans-title=The Jews in Poland's history of the 19th and the 20th century |publisher=[[Ministry of National Education (Poland)]] |format=PDF |pages=3, 5–6 |date=25 November 2013 |url=https://men.gov.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ydzi_w_historii_polski_referat_wm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficult situation in the private sector led to enrolment growth in higher education.

With the influence of the Endecja party growing, antisemitism gathered new momentum in Poland and was most felt in smaller towns and in spheres in which Jews came into direct contact with Poles, such as in Polish schools or on the sports field. Further academic harassment, such as the introduction of [[ghetto benches]], which forced Jewish students to sit in sections of the lecture halls reserved exclusively for them, anti-Jewish riots, and semi-official or unofficial quotas (''[[Numerus clausus]]'') introduced in 1937 in some universities, halved the number of Jews in Polish universities between independence (1918) and the late 1930s. The restrictions were so inclusive that – while the Jews made up 20.4% of the student body in 1928 – by 1937 their share was down to only 7.5%,&lt;ref&gt;Leo Cooper, ''In the Shadow of the Polish Eagle: The Poles, the Holocaust and Beyond'', Palgrave (2000), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; out of the total population of 9.75% Jews in the country according to [[Polish census of 1931|1931 census]].&lt;ref name="PolishCensus1931"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://statlibr.stat.gov.pl/exlibris/aleph/a18_1/apache_media/VUNVGMLANSCQQFGYHCN3VDLK12A9U5.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317212240/http://statlibr.stat.gov.pl/exlibris/aleph/a18_1/apache_media/VUNVGMLANSCQQFGYHCN3VDLK12A9U5.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-17 |title=Główny Urząd Statystyczny Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej, drugi powszechny spis ludności z dn. 9.XII 1931 r. – Mieszkania i gospodarstwa domowe ludność |trans-title=Central Statistical Office the Polish Republic, the second census dated 9.XII 1931 – Abodes and household populace |language=pl |publisher=Central Statistical office of the Polish Republic |year=1938 |format=PDF |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 the Catholic [[trade union]]s of Polish doctors and lawyers restricted their new members to [[Christian]] Poles (in a similar manner the Jewish trade unions excluded non-Jewish professionals from their ranks after 1918).&lt;ref&gt;Herbert A.

The national boycott of Jewish businesses and advocacy for their confiscation was promoted by the [[Endecja]] party, which introduced the term "Christian shop".

The main strain of antisemitism in Poland during this time was motivated by Catholic religious beliefs and centuries-old myths such as the [[blood libel]]. This religious-based antisemitism was sometimes joined with an ultra-nationalistic stereotype of Jews as disloyal to the Polish nation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GmVt-O3AR34C&amp;pg=PA133 On the Edge of Destruction: Jews of Poland Between the Two World Wars]. Wayne State University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of World War II, many typical Polish Christians believed that there were far too many Jews in the country and the Polish government became increasingly concerned with the "Jewish Question". Some politicians were in favor of mass Jewish emigration from Poland.

By the time of the German invasion in 1939, antisemitism was escalating, and hostility towards Jews was a mainstay of the right-wing political forces post-Piłsudski regime and also the Catholic Church. Discrimination and violence against Jews had rendered the Polish Jewish population increasingly destitute, as was the case throughout much of Central and Eastern Europe. Despite the impending threat to the Polish Republic from Nazi Germany, there was little effort seen in the way of reconciliation with Poland's Jewish population. In July 1939 the pro-government ''[[Gazeta Polska (1929–1939)|Gazeta Polska]]'' wrote, "The fact that our relations with the Reich are worsening does not in the least deactivate our program in the Jewish question—there is not and cannot be any common ground between our internal Jewish problem and Poland's relations with the Hitlerite Reich."&lt;ref&gt;Edward D.

===Territories annexed by USSR (1939–41)===
{{Main article|Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union}}
The Soviet Union signed a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Pact with Nazi Germany]] on August 23, 1939 containing a protocol about partition of Poland (generally known but denied by the Soviet Union for the next 50 years).&lt;ref name="chatham2011"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/ia/archive/view/164427 |title=The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact |publisher=Chatham House, The Royal Institute of International Affairs |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German army attacked Poland on September 1, 1939. The Soviet Union followed suit by invading eastern Poland on September 17, 1939. Within weeks, 61.2% of Polish Jews found themselves [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|under the German occupation]], while 38.8% were trapped in the [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union]]. Based on population migration from West to East during and after the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion]] the percentage of Jews under the Soviet-occupation was substantially higher than that of the national census.&lt;ref name="ushmm-1939"/&gt;

The [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet annexation]] was accompanied by the widespread arrests of government officials, police, military personnel, border guards, teachers, priests, judges etc., followed by the [[NKVD prisoner massacres]] and massive deportation of 320,000 Polish nationals to the Soviet interior and the [[List of Gulag camps|Gulag slave labor camps]] where, as a result of the inhuman conditions, about half of them died before the end of war.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Polish nation's WWII death toll |publisher=AFP / Expatica |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=12 December 2015 |url=http://www.expatica.com/de/news/german-news/Polish-experts-lower-nation_s-WWII-death-toll--_55843.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish refugees under the Soviet occupation had little knowledge about what was going on under the Germans since the Soviet media did not report on the goings on in territories occupied by their Nazi ally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nz_RAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=soviet+nazi+allies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_3b6qwdTbAhUCY6wKHQhjCDIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=soviet%20nazi%20allies&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=maEfAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=soviet+nazi+allies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_3b6qwdTbAhUCY6wKHQhjCDIQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=alliance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people from Western Poland registered for repatriation back to the German zone, including wealthier Jews, as well as some political and social activists from the [[interwar period]]. Instead, they were labelled "class enemies" by the [[NKVD]] and deported to Siberia with the others. Jews caught at border crossings, or engaged in trade and other "illegal" activities were also arrested and deported. Several thousand, mostly captured Polish soldiers, were executed; some of them Jewish.&lt;ref name="geni/Lutsk"/&gt;

All private property and – crucial to Jewish economic life – private businesses were nationalized; political activity was delegalized and thousands of people were jailed, many of whom were later executed. Zionism, which was designated by the Soviets as counter-revolutionary was also forbidden. In just one day all Polish and Jewish media were shut down and replaced by the new Soviet press,&lt;ref name="geni/Lutsk"&gt;Dr Pawel Goldstein, [http://www.geni.com/projects/Lutsk-Luck-Ghetto/11424 Lutsk (Luck) Ghetto.] Geni.com.&lt;/ref&gt; which conducted political propaganda attacking religion including the Jewish faith. Synagogues and churches were not yet closed but heavily taxed. The Soviet ruble of little value was immediately equalized to the much higher Polish zloty and by the end of 1939, zloty was abolished.&lt;ref name="www1.yadvashem.org.il"/&gt; Most economic activity became subject to central planning and the NKVD restrictions. Since the Jewish communities tended to rely more on commerce and small scale businesses, the confiscations of property affected them to a greater degree than the general populace. The Soviet rule resulted in near collapse of the local economy, characterized by insufficient wages and general shortage of goods and materials. The Jews, like other inhabitants of the region, saw a fall in their living standards.&lt;ref name="ushmm-1939"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005593 |title=Jewish Refugees, 1939 |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |work=German Invasion of Poland |date=June 20, 2014 |accessdate=21 March 2015 |author=Holocaust Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www1.yadvashem.org.il"/&gt;

Under the Soviet policy, ethnic Poles were dismissed and denied access to positions in the civil service. Former senior officials and notable members of the Polish community were arrested and exiled together with their families.&lt;ref name="PHC"&gt;[http://www.polandsholocaust.org/memoir2.html World War Two Timeline – Poland 1940].

The issue of Jewish collaboration with the Soviet occupation remains controversial. Some scholars note that while not pro-Communist, many Jews saw the Soviets as the lesser threat compared to the German Nazis. They stress that stories of Jews welcoming the Soviets on the streets, vividly remembered by many Poles from the [[Kresy|eastern part of the country]] are impressionistic and not reliable indicators of the level of Jewish support for the Soviets. Additionally, it has been noted that some ethnic Poles were as prominent as Jews in filling civil and police positions in the occupation administration, and that Jews, both civilians and in the Polish military, suffered equally at the hands of the Soviet occupiers.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel D. Kassow.

Even though only a small percentage of the Jewish community had been members of the [[Communist Party of Poland]] during the interwar era, they had occupied an influential and conspicuous place in the party's leadership and in the rank and file in major centres, such as Warsaw, Łódź and Lwów. A larger number of younger Jews, often through the pro-Marxist Bund or some Zionist groups, were sympathetic to [[Communism]] and Soviet Russia, both of which had been enemies of the [[Polish Second Republic]]. As a result of these factors they found it easy after 1939 to participate in the Soviet occupation administration in Eastern Poland, and briefly occupied prominent positions in industry, schools, local government, police and other Soviet-installed institutions. The concept of "Judeo-communism" was reinforced during the period of the Soviet occupation (see [[Żydokomuna]]).&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Michlic.

There were also Jews who assisted Poles during the Soviet occupation. Among the thousands of Polish officers killed by the Soviet [[NKVD]] in the [[Katyń massacre]] there were 500–600 Jews. From 1939 to 1941 between 100,000 and 300,000 Polish Jews were deported from [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union|Soviet-occupied Polish territory]] into the [[Soviet Union]]. Some of them, especially Polish [[Communism|Communists]] (e.g. [[Jakub Berman]]), moved voluntarily; however, most of them were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forcibly deported or imprisoned]] in a ''[[Gulag]]''. Small numbers of Polish Jews (about 6,000) were able to leave the Soviet Union in 1942 with the [[Władysław Anders]] army, among them the future [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Menachem Begin]]. During the Polish army's [[Polish II Corps|II Corps]]' stay in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], 67% (2,972) of the Jewish soldiers deserted to settle in Palestine, and many joined the ''[[Irgun]]''. General Anders decided not to prosecute the deserters and emphasized that the Jewish soldiers who remained in the Force fought bravely.&lt;ref&gt;Yisrael Gutman [http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206564.pdf Jews in General Anders’ Army In the Soviet Union]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Polish cemetery at Monte Cassino|Cemetery of Polish soldiers]] who died during the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] includes headstones bearing a [[Star of David]].

Following [[Operation Barbarossa]], many Jews in what was then Eastern Poland fell victim to Nazi [[death squad]]s called ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', which massacred Jews, especially in 1941. Some of these German-inspired massacres were carried out with help from, or active participation of Poles themselves: for example, the [[Jedwabne pogrom]], in which between 300 ([[Institute of National Remembrance]]'s Final Findings&lt;ref&gt;[http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/J/final.html Summary of IPN's final findings on Jedwabne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201535/http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/J/final.html |date=2016-03-03 }} (English)&lt;/ref&gt;) and 1,600 Jews ([[Jan T. Gross]]) were tortured and beaten to death by members of the local population. The full extent of Polish participation in the massacres of the Polish Jewish community remains a controversial subject, in part due to Jewish leaders' refusal to allow the remains of the Jewish victims to be exhumed and their cause of death to be properly established. The Polish Institute for National Remembrance identified twenty-two other towns that had [[pogrom]]s similar to Jedwabne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,669067,00.html Discussion of IPN findings]&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for these massacres are still debated, but they included [[antisemitism]], resentment over alleged cooperation with the Soviet invaders in the Polish-Soviet War and during the 1939 invasion of the [[Kresy]] regions, greed for the possessions of the Jews, and of course coercion by the Nazis to participate in such massacres.

[[Holocaust survivors]]' views of Polish behavior during the War span a wide range, depending on their personal experiences. Some are very negative, based on the view of Christian Poles as passive witnesses who failed to act and aid the Jews as they were being persecuted or liquidated by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holocaustsurvivors.org/data.show.php?di=record&amp;da=encyclopedia&amp;ke=107 "Polish-Jewish Relations", Holocaust Survivors Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Poles, who were also victims of [[Nazi crimes]],&lt;ref name="lukas"/&gt; were often afraid for their own and their family's lives and this fear prevented many of them from giving aid and assistance, even if some of them felt sympathy for the Jews. [[Emanuel Ringelblum]], a Polish-Jewish historian of the Warsaw Ghetto, wrote critically of the indifferent and sometimes joyful responses in Warsaw to the destruction of Polish Jews in the Ghetto.&lt;ref name="P-M"/&gt; However, [[Gunnar S. Paulsson]] stated that Polish citizens of Warsaw managed to support and hide the same percentage of Jews as did the citizens of cities in Western European countries.&lt;ref name="hnetradz"/&gt; Paulsson's research shows that at least as far as [[Warsaw]] is concerned, the number of Poles aiding Jews far outnumbered those who sold out their Jewish neighbors to the Nazis. During the Nazi occupation of Warsaw 70,000–90,000 Polish gentiles aided Jews, while 3,000–4,000 were [[szmalcownik]]s, or blackmailers who collaborated with the Nazis in persecuting the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Marci Shore]] |url=http://www.aapjstudies.org/index.php?id=36 |title= Gunnar S.

===Ghettos and death camps===
The German Nazis established six [[extermination camp]]s throughout [[German occupied Poland|occupied Poland]] by 1942. All of these – at [[Chelmno extermination camp|Chełmno (Kulmhof)]], [[Belzec extermination camp|Bełżec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibór]], [[Treblinka]], [[Majdanek]] and [[Auschwitz]] (Oświęcim) – were located near the rail network so that the victims could be easily transported. The system of the camps was expanded over the course of the German occupation of Poland and their purposes were diversified; some served as transit camps, some as [[forced labor in Germany during World War II|forced labor camps]] and the majority as death camps. While in the death camps, the victims were usually killed shortly after arrival, in the other camps able-bodied Jews were worked and beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/history.html History of the Holocaust – An Introduction].

[[File:Ghettos Eastern Europe 1941-1942.gif|left|thumb|Jewish Ghettos in German occupied Poland and Eastern Europe]]

Between October 1939 and July 1942 a system of ghettos was imposed for the confinement of Jews. The [[Warsaw Ghetto]] was the largest in all of World War II, with 380,000 people crammed into an area of {{convert|1.3|mi2|1|abbr=out}}. The [[Łódź Ghetto]] was the second largest, holding about 160,000 prisoners. Other large Jewish ghettos in leading Polish cities included [[Białystok Ghetto]] in  [[Białystok]], [[Częstochowa Ghetto]], [[Kielce Ghetto]], [[Kraków Ghetto]] in [[Kraków]], [[Lublin Ghetto]], [[Lwów Ghetto]] in present-day [[Lviv]], [[Stanisławów Ghetto]] also in present-day Ukraine, [[Brześć Ghetto]] in presend-day Belarus, and [[Radom Ghetto]] among others. Ghettos were also established in hundreds of smaller settlements and villages around the country. The overcrowding, dirt, lice, lethal epidemics such as [[typhoid]] and hunger all resulted in countless deaths.

During the occupation of Poland, the Germans used various laws to separate ethnic Poles from Jewish ones. In the ghettos the population was separated by putting the Poles into the "Aryan Side" and the Polish Jews into the "Jewish Side". Any Pole found giving any help to a Jewish Pole was subject to the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald L. Niewyk |author2=Francis R.

When this proved difficult escapees often returned to the ghetto on their own. If caught, Germans would murder the escapees and leave their bodies in plain view as a warning to others. Despite these terror tactics, attempts at escape from ghettos continued until their liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_holocaust/lost_worlds/grodno/grodno_the_german_occupation.html "Lost Jewish Worlds – Grodno", Yad Vashem]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Nazi terror reigned throughout the Aryan districts, the chances of remaining successfully hidden depended on a fluent knowledge of the language and on having close ties with the community. Many Poles were not willing to hide Jews who might have escaped the ghettos or who might have been in hiding due to fear for their own lives and that of their families.

While the German policy towards Jews was ruthless and criminal, their policy towards Christian Poles who helped Jews was very much the same. The Germans would often murder non-Jewish Poles for small misdemeanors. Execution for help rendered to Jews, even the most basic kinds, was automatic. In any apartment block or area where Jews were found to be harboured, everybody in the house would be immediately shot by the Germans. For this thousands of non-Jewish Poles were executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.core.com/~mikerose/waryears.htm Jewish History in Poland during the years 1939–1945] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609193411/http://members.core.com/~mikerose/waryears.htm |date=2009-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiding in a Christian society to which the Jews were only partially assimilated was a daunting task.&lt;ref name="hiding"/&gt; They needed to quickly acquire not only a new identity, but a new body of knowledge.&lt;ref name=hiding/&gt; Many Jews spoke Polish with a distinguished Yiddish or Hebrew accent, used a different nonverbal language, different gestures and facial expressions. Jews with the specific physical characteristics were particularly vulnerable.&lt;ref name=hiding/&gt;

Some individuals blackmailed [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|Jews and non-Jewish Poles hiding them]], and took advantage of their desperation by collecting money, or worse, turning them over to the Germans for a reward. The [[Gestapo]] provided a standard prize to those who informed on Jews hidden on the 'Aryan' side, consisting of cash, liquor, sugar, and cigarettes. Jews were robbed and handed over to the Germans by "[[szmalcownik]]s" (the 'shmalts' people: from ''shmalts'' or ''szmalec'', Yiddish and Polish for 'grease'). In extreme cases, the Jews informed on other Jews to alleviate hunger with the awarded prize.&lt;ref name="Piotrowski66"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hC0-dk7vpM8C&amp;q=%22Jews+collaborating%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Jews%20collaborating%22&amp;f=false |title=Poland's Holocaust: Ethnic Strife, Collaboration with Occupying Forces |publisher=McFarland |year=1998 |author=Tadeusz Piotrowski |page=66 |isbn=0786403713}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extortionists were condemned by the [[Polish Underground State]].

The belief that the experienced suffering was preordained and that it would result in the coming of the [[Messiah]] also existed among some religious Jews.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt;

To discourage Poles from giving shelter to Jews, the Germans often searched houses and introduced ruthless penalties. Poland was the only occupied country during World War II where the [[Nazism|Nazis]] formally imposed the [[death penalty]] for anybody found sheltering and helping Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081030094647/http://www1.yadvashem.org/Odot/prog/image_into.asp?id=2743&amp;lang=EN&amp;type_id=&amp;addr=%2FIMAGE_TYPE%2F2743.JPG Poland, Execution of Poles by a German Police Firing Squad.] Film and Photo Archive, [[Yad Vashem]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nie-Nic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polonsky"/&gt; The penalty applied not only to the person who did the helping, but also extended to his or her family, neighbors and sometimes to entire villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isurvived.org/Frameset4References-3/-PolishRighteous.html Holocaust Survivors and Remembrance Project: Polish Righteous]&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Germans applied the principle of collective responsibility whose purpose was to encourage neighbors to inform on each other in order to avoid punishment. The nature of these policies was widely known and visibly publicized by the Nazis who sought to terrorize the Polish population.

Food rations for the Poles were small (669 kcal per day in 1941) compared to other occupied nations throughout Europe and [[black market]] prices of necessary goods were high, factors which made it difficult to hide people and almost impossible to hide entire families, especially in the cities. Despite these draconian measures imposed by the Nazis, Poland has the highest number of [[Righteous Among The Nations]] awards at the [[Yad Vashem]] Museum (6,339).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/righteous_new/statistics.html The Righteous Among the Nations]. .yadvashem.org.

The ghetto was established by the German [[General Gouvernment|Governor-General]] [[Hans Frank]] on October 16, 1940. Initially, almost 140,000 Jews were moved into the ghetto from all parts of Warsaw. At the same time approximately 110,000 Poles had been forcibly evicted from the area. The Germans selected [[Adam Czerniakow]] to take charge of the Jewish Council called [[Judenrat]] made up of 24 Jewish men ordered to organize Jewish labor battalions as well as [[Jewish Ghetto Police]] which would be responsible for maintaining order within the Ghetto walls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081030094651/http://www1.yadvashem.org/Odot/prog/image_into.asp?id=1361&amp;lang=EN&amp;type_id=&amp;addr=%2FIMAGE_TYPE%2F1361.JPG  Adam Czerniakow.] Film and Photo Archive, [[Yad Vashem]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://warsawghetto.epixtech.co.uk/20Chlodn.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027065831/http://warsawghetto.epixtech.co.uk/20Chlodn.htm|date=October 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Jewish policemen were corrupt and immoral. Soon the Nazis demanded even more from the Judenrat and the demands were much more cruel. Death was the punishment for the slightest indication of noncompliance by the Judenrat. Sometimes the Judenrat refused to collaborate in which case its members were consequently executed and replaced by the new group of people. [[Adam Czerniakow]] who was the head of the Warsaw Judenrat committed suicide &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diapozytyw.pl/en/site/ludzie/adam_czerniakow Dia-Pozytyw: People, Biographical Profiles].

The population of the ghetto reached 380,000 people by the end of 1940, about 30% of the population of Warsaw. However, the size of the Ghetto was only about 2.4% of the size of the city. The Germans closed off the Ghetto from the outside world, building a wall around it by November 16, 1940. During the next year and a half, Jews from smaller cities and villages were brought into the Warsaw Ghetto, while diseases (especially [[typhoid]]) and starvation kept the inhabitants at about the same number. Average food rations in 1941 for Jews in Warsaw were limited to 253 kcal, and 669 kcal for Poles, as opposed to 2,613 kcal for Germans. On July 22, 1942, [[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|the mass deportation]] of the Warsaw Ghetto inhabitants began.{{sfn|Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs|2014|pp=10–14}} During the next fifty-two days (until September 12, 1942) about 300,000 people were transported by freight train to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]]. The [[Jewish Ghetto Police]] were ordered to escort the ghetto inhabitants to the [[Umschlagplatz (Warsaw Ghetto)|Umschlagplatz]] train station. They were spared from the deportations until September 1942 in return for their cooperation, but afterwards shared their fate with families and relatives. On January 18, 1943, a group of Ghetto militants led by the right leaning [[Żydowski Związek Wojskowy|ŻZW]], including some members of the left leaning [[Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa|ŻOB]] rose up in a first Warsaw uprising.

The Jewish fighters also received support from the Polish Underground ([[Armia Krajowa]]). The German forces, which included 2,842 Nazi soldiers and 7,000 security personnel, were not capable of crushing the Jewish resistance in open street combat and after several days, decided to switch strategy by setting buildings on fire in which the Jewish fighters hid. The commander of the ŻOB, [[Mordechai Anielewicz]] died fighting on May 8, 1943 at the organization's command centre on 18 Mila Street.

It took the Germans twenty-seven days to put down the uprising, after some very heavy fighting. The German general [[Jürgen Stroop]] in his report stated that his troops had killed 6,065 Jewish fighters during the battle. After the uprising was already over, [[Heinrich Himmler]] had the Great Synagogue on Tłomackie Square (outside the ghetto) destroyed as a celebration of German victory and a symbol that the Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw was no longer.

A group of fighters escaped from the ghetto through the sewers and reached the Lomianki forest. About 50 ghetto fighters were saved by the Polish "People's Guard" and later formed their own partisan group, named after Anielewicz. Even after the end of the uprising there were still several hundreds of Jews who continued living in the ruined ghetto. Many of them survived thanks to the contacts they managed to establish with Poles outside the ghetto. The Uprising inspired Jews throughout Poland. Many Jewish leaders who survived the liquidation continued underground work outside the ghetto. They hid other Jews, forged necessary documents and were active in the [[Polish underground]] in other parts of Warsaw and surrounding area.

Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, was followed by other [[Ghetto uprising]]s in many smaller towns and cities across German occupied Poland. Many Jews were found alive in the ruins of the former Warsaw Ghetto during the 1944 general [[Warsaw Uprising]] when the Poles themselves rose up against the Germans. Some of the survivors of 1943 [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], still held in camps at or near Warsaw, were freed during 1944 Warsaw Uprising, led by the Polish [[resistance movement]] [[Armia Krajowa]], and immediately joined Polish fighters. Only a few of them survived. The Polish commander of one Jewish unit, [[Waclaw Micuta]], described them as some of the best fighters, always at the front line.

Some 166,000 people lost their lives in the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]], including perhaps as many as 17,000 Polish Jews who had either fought with the [[Armia Krajowa|AK]] or had been discovered in hiding (''see:'' [[Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński]] and [[Stanisław Aronson]]). Warsaw was razed to the ground by the Germans and more than 150,000 Poles were sent to labor or concentration camps. On January 17, 1945, the [[Soviet Army]] entered destroyed and nearly uninhabited Warsaw. Some 300 Jews were found hiding in the ruins in the Polish part of the city (''see:'' [[Wladyslaw Szpilman]]).
[[File:Ghetto Uprising Warsaw2.jpg|thumb|The [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of 1943 saw the destruction of what remained of the Ghetto]]

The fate of the Warsaw Ghetto was similar to that of the other ghettos in which Jews were concentrated. With the decision of [[Nazi Germany]] to begin the [[Final Solution]], the destruction of the Jews of Europe, [[Aktion Reinhard]] began in 1942, with the opening of the extermination camps of Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka, followed by Auschwitz-Birkenau where people were killed in gas chambers and mass executions (death wall).&lt;ref name="Auschwitz-Birkenau Concentration Camp - Advice from a Tour Guide"/&gt; Many died from hunger, starvation, disease, torture or by pseudo-medical experiments. The mass deportation of Jews from ghettos to these camps, such as happened at the Warsaw Ghetto, soon followed, and more than 1.7 million Jews were killed at the Aktion Reinhard camps by October 1943 alone.

====Białystok Ghetto and uprising====
{{main article|Białystok Ghetto}}
{{further information|Białystok Ghetto Uprising}}
In August 1941, the Germans ordered the establishment of a [[ghetto]] in Białystok. About 50,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding region were confined in a small area of Białystok. The ghetto had two sections, divided by the [[Biała River (Supraśl basin)|Biala River]]. Most Jews in the Białystok ghetto worked in forced-labor projects, primarily in large textile factories located within the ghetto boundaries. The Germans also sometimes used Jews in forced-labor projects outside the ghetto.

In February 1943, approximately 10,000 Białystok Jews were deported to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]]. During the deportations, hundreds of Jews, mainly those deemed too weak or sick to travel, were killed.

In August 1943, the Germans mounted an operation to destroy the Białystok ghetto. German forces and local police auxiliaries surrounded the ghetto and began to round up Jews systematically for deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp. Approximately 7,600 Jews were held in a central transit camp in the city before deportation to Treblinka. Those deemed fit to work were sent to the [[Majdanek]] camp. In Majdanek, after another screening for ability to work, they were transported to the Poniatowa, Blizyn, or Auschwitz camps. Those deemed too weak to work were murdered at Majdanek. More than 1,000 Jewish children were sent first to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] ghetto in [[Bohemia]], and then to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], where they were killed.

On August 15, 1943, the [[Białystok Ghetto Uprising]] began, and several hundred Polish Jews and members of the [[Anti-Fascist Military Organisation]] ({{lang-pl|Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa}}) started an armed struggle against the German troops who were carrying out the planned liquidation and deportation of the ghetto to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ruch oporu w getcie białostockim. Samoobrona-zagłada-powstanie |author=Mark, B |year=1952 |location=Warsaw|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;The guerrillas were armed with only one [[machine gun]], several dozen pistols, [[Molotov cocktail]]s and bottles filled with acid. The fighting in isolated pockets of resistance lasted for several days, but the defence was broken almost instantly. As with the earlier [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of April 1943, the Białystok uprising had no chances for military success, but it was the second largest [[ghetto uprising]], after the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. Several dozen guerrillas managed to break through to the forests surrounding Białystok where they joined the partisan units of [[Armia Krajowa]] and other organisations and survived the war.

===Postwar period===
The number of Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust is difficult to ascertain.

Some 20,000–40,000 Jews were repatriated from Germany and other countries. At its postwar peak, up to 240,000 returning Jews might have resided in Poland mostly in [[Warsaw]], [[Łódź]], Kraków, [[Wrocław]] and [[Lower Silesia]], e.g., [[Dzierżoniów]] (where there was a significant Jewish community initially consisting of local concentration camp survivors), [[Legnica]], and [[Bielawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Albert Stankowski |title=Studia z historii Żydów w Polsce po 1945 roku |location=Warsaw |year=2000 |pp=107–111 |publisher=Żydowski Instytut Historyczny |ISBN=8385888365 |others=Grzegorz Berendt, August Grabski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Poland had changed however. In spite of the major [[Polish contribution to World War II]], Poland was placed under direct Soviet control due to British and US dependence on the Soviet military commitment to the defeat of [[Hitler]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s unwillingness to confront Stalin over his future plans for Poland.  Soviet style Communism was established and the borders of Poland were moved west. The Soviet Union annexed the [[Kresy|eastern regions]], which had many ethnic minorities including Jewish [[shtetl]] communities.

=== Anti-Jewish violence by Poles ===
Jewish survivors returning to their homes in Poland found it practically impossible to reconstruct their prewar lives.&lt;ref name="USHMM-archive1" /&gt; Jewish communities and Jewish life as it had existed was gone. Jews who somehow survived the Holocaust often discovered that their homes had been looted or destroyed'''.'''  

Amidst the [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–46)|raging civil war in postwar Poland]],&lt;ref name="TP-2" /&gt; anti-Jewish riots broke out in several cities. Hundreds of Jews were murdered in anti-communist violence (see: [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–46]]).&lt;ref name="Engel1" /&gt; The best-known case is the [[Kielce pogrom]] of July 4 1946,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080121220530/http://www1.yadvashem.org/Odot/prog/image_into.asp?id=3048&amp;lang=EN&amp;type_id=&amp;addr=%2FIMAGE_TYPE%2F3048.JPG]&lt;/ref&gt; in which thirty-seven Jews and two Poles were murdered. The Communist government's response to the Kielce atrocity was rapid.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; Special investigators were dispatched and military tribunals formed.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; Activities of the local authorities were investigated.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; However, only the local commander of [[Milicja Obywatelska]] was found guilty of inaction.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; Nine alleged participants of the pogrom were sentenced to death on trumped up charges; three were given lengthy prison sentences.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The debate in Poland continues about the involvement of regular troops in the killings, at the exact time of the Soviet takeover.&lt;ref name="ipn2008"&gt;{{cite journal|date=4 July 2008|title=The Kielce pogrom as told by the eyewitness|trans-title=Pogrom kielecki – oczami świadka|url=http://pamiec.pl/download/49/27596/IPN2920080704.pdf|journal=Niezalezna Gazeta Polska|location=Warsaw|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance]]|author1-first=Andrzej|author1-last=Jankowski|author2-first=Leszek|author2-last=Bukowski|pp=1–8}} ''Also in'' {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=xgI_AQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=zabitych+4+lipca+1946|title=Around the Kielce pogrom|publisher=IPN|others=with Foreword by Jan Żaryn|year=2008|isbn=83-60464-87-1|volume=2|pp=166–71|trans-title=Wokół pogromu kieleckiego}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where no pogroms occurred, returning Jews still met with threats, violence, and murder from their Polish neighbors, occasionally in a deliberate and organized manner. People of the community frequently had knowledge of these murders and turned a blind eye or held no sympathy for the victims. Jewish communities responded to this violence by reporting the violence to the Ministry of Public Administration, but were granted little assistance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/841327982|title=Fear : Anti-Semitism in Poland After Auschwitz|last=Jan.|first=Gross,|date=2007|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780307430960|location=|pages=60-68|oclc=841327982}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several causes led to the anti-Jewish violence of 1944-1947. One cause was traditional religious Jew-hatred; the [[Kraków pogrom|pogrom in Cracow]] (11 August 1945) and in Kielce followed accusations of ritual murder. Another cause was the gentile Polish hostility to the Communist takeover. Even though very Jews lived in postwar Poland, many Poles believed they dominated the Communist authorities, a belief expressed in the term ''Zydokomuna'' (Judeo-Communist), popular in anti-Jewish propaganda in the years . Yet another reason for Polish violence towards Jews stemmed from the fear that survivors would recover their property.&lt;ref name="N-A" /&gt; Over 3 million Jewish Poles had perished during the Holocaust, leading the local population to occupy formerly Jewish property and space. New inhabitants at times were very unhappy to see returning Jewish survivors and refused to return property back to the former owners. The possibility of obtaining property was a motive for local Poles to carry out violence, and even murder, against returning Jews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Some Jewish property was categorized as "abandoned" and put in trusteeship of the state. This property not only included homes, but public institutions such as synagogues and other buildings belonging to the vanished Jewish community. The increasing number of Jews fleeing to larger cities in search of each other resulted in the authorities in smaller towns obtaining more property to distribute among the townsfolk.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition, some returning Jews were met with antisemitic bias in Polish employment and education administrations. Post-war labor certificates contained markings distinguishing Jews from non-Jews. The Jewish community in Szczecin reported a lengthy report of complaints regarding job discrimination. Although Jewish schools were created in the few towns containing a relatively large Jewish population, many Jewish children were enrolled into Polish state schools. Some state schools, as in the town of Otwock, forbade Jewish children to enroll. In the state schools that did allow Jewish children, there were numerous accounts of beatings and persecution targeting these children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Aliyah Bet===

For a variety of reasons, vast majority of returning Jewish survivors left Poland soon after the war ended.&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"/&gt; Many left for the West because they did not want to live under a Communist regime. Some left because of the violence they faced in postwar Poland,&lt;ref name="N-A" /&gt; and because they did not want to live where their family members had been murdered, and instead have arranged to live with relatives or friends in different western democracies. Others wanted to go to [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] soon to be the new state of [[Israel]], especially after Gen. Spychalski signed a decree allowing Jews to leave Poland without visas or exit permits.&lt;ref name="Kochavi-175"/&gt;

Between 1945 and 1948, 100,000–120,000 Jews left Poland. Their departure was largely organized by the [[Zionism|Zionist]] activists including [[Adolf Berman]] and [[Icchak Cukierman]], under the umbrella of a semi-clandestine ''[[Berihah]]'' ("Flight") organization.&lt;ref name="YV-archive3" /&gt; ''Berihah'' was also responsible for the organized [[Aliyah]] emigration of Jews from [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]], and Poland, totaling 250,000 survivors. In 1947, a military training camp for young Jewish volunteers to [[Hagana]] was established in [[Bolków]], Poland. The camp trained 7,000 soldiers who then traveled to Palestine to fight for Israel. The boot-camp existed until the end of 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sztetl.org.pl/en/towns/b/1744-bolkow/101-organizations-and-associations/80234-haganas-training-camp-bolkow Hagana's training camp in Bolkow.] Sztetl.org.pl.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second wave of Jewish emigration (50,000) took place during the liberalization of the Communist regime between 1957 and 1959. After 1967's [[Six-Day War]], in which the Soviet Union supported the Arab side, the Polish communist party adopted an anti-Jewish course of action which in the years 1968–1969 provoked the last mass migration of Jews from Poland.&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"/&gt;

The Bund took part in the post-war [[Polish legislative election, 1947|elections of 1947]] on a common ticket with the (non-communist) [[Polish Socialist Party]] (PPS) and gained its first and only parliamentary seat in its Polish history, plus several seats in municipal councils. Under pressure from Soviet-installed communist authorities, the Bund's leaders 'voluntarily' disbanded the party in 1948–1949 against the opposition of many activists. Stalinist Poland was basically governed by the Soviet [[NKVD]] which was against the renewal of Jewish religious and cultural life. In the years 1948–49, all remaining Jewish schools were nationalized by the communists and Yiddish was replaced with Polish as a language of teaching.

For those Polish Jews who remained, the rebuilding of Jewish life in Poland was carried out between October 1944 and 1950 by the Central Committee of Polish Jews (''Centralny Komitet Żydów Polskich'', CKŻP) which provided legal, educational, social care, cultural, and propaganda services. A countrywide Jewish Religious Community, led by [[Dawid Kahane]], who served as [[chief rabbi]] of the Polish Armed Forces, functioned between 1945 and 1948 until it was absorbed by the CKŻP. Eleven independent political Jewish parties, of which eight were legal, existed until their dissolution during 1949–50. Hospitals and schools were opened in Poland by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and ORT to provide service to Jewish communities.&lt;ref name=Weiner/&gt; Some Jewish cultural institutions were established including the [[Yiddish theater|Yiddish State Theater]] founded in 1950 and directed by [[Ida Kaminska]], the [[Jewish Historical Institute]], an academic institution specializing in the research of the history and culture of the Jews in Poland, and the Yiddish newspaper ''Folks-Shtime'' ("People's Voice"). Following liberalization after [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, in this 1958–59 period, 50,000 Jews emigrated to Israel.&lt;ref name="relations"/&gt;

Some Polish Communists of Jewish descent actively participated in the establishment of the communist regime in the [[People's Republic of Poland]] between 1944 and 1956. Hand-picked by Joseph Stalin, prominent Jews held posts in the [[Politburo]] of the [[Polish United Worker's Party]] including [[Jakub Berman]], head of state security apparatus ''[[Urząd Bezpieczeństwa]]'' (UB),{{r|hoover}} and [[Hilary Minc]] responsible for establishing a Communist-style economy. Together with hardliner [[Bolesław Bierut]], Berman and Minc formed a triumvirate of the Stalinist leaders in postwar Poland.&lt;ref name="hoover"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Jakub Berman’s Papers Received at the Hoover Institution Archives |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130192558/http://www.hoover.org/library-and-archives/acquisitions/28981 |date=August 11, 2008 |publisher=The Board of Trustees of [[Leland Stanford Junior University]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]] |author=[[Hoover Institution]] |journal=Library and Archives Recent Acquisitions}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1956, during the process of [[destalinisation]] in the [[Polish People's Republic|People's Republic]] under [[Władysław Gomułka]], some Jewish officials from ''Urząd Bezpieczeństwa'' including [[Roman Romkowski]], [[Jacek Różański]], and [[Anatol Fejgin]], were prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms for "power abuses" including the torture of Polish anti-fascists including [[Witold Pilecki]] among others. Yet another Jewish official, [[Józef Światło]], after escaping to the West in 1953, exposed through [[Radio Free Europe]] the interrogation methods used the UB which led to its restructuring in 1954. [[Solomon Morel]] a member of the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland]] and commandant of the Stalinist era [[Zgoda labour camp]], fled Poland for Israel in 1992 to escape prosecution. [[Helena Wolińska-Brus]], a former Stalinist prosecutor who emigrated to England in the late 1960s, fought being extradited to Poland on charges related to the execution of a Second World War resistance hero [[Emil Fieldorf]]. Wolińska-Brus died in London in 2008.&lt;ref name=krakowpost&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Hodge |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713174914/http://www.krakowpost.com/article/1218 |title=Helena Wolinska-Brus: 1919–2008.

===1967–1989===
In 1967, following the [[Six-Day War]] between [[Israel]] and the [[Arab]] states, Poland's Communist government, following the Soviet lead, broke off diplomatic relations with Israel and launched an antisemitic campaign under the guise of "anti-Zionism". However, the campaign did not resonate well with the Polish public, as most Poles saw similarities between Israel's fight for survival and Poland's past struggles for independence. Many Poles also felt pride in the success of the Israeli military, which was dominated by Polish Jews. The slogan "our Jews beat the Soviet Arabs" (Nasi Żydzi pobili sowieckich Arabów) became popular in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wprost.pl/ar/13189/Wojna-zastepcza/?O=13189&amp;pg=1 Nasi Żydzi biją sowieckich Arabów]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://prawy.pl/r2_index.php?dz=felietony&amp;id=37395&amp;subdz=] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602202347/http://prawy.pl/r2_index.php?dz=felietony&amp;id=37395&amp;subdz=|date=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of the 40,000 Jews in Poland by the late 1960s were completely assimilated into the broader society.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} However, this did not prevent them from becoming victims of a campaign, centrally organized by the Polish Communist Party, with Soviet backing, which equated Jewish origins with "Zionism" and disloyalty to a Socialist Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kunicki|first=Mikolaj|date=May 1, 2015|title=The Red and the Brown: Bolesław Piasecki, the Polish Communists, and the Anti-Zionist Campaign in Poland, 1967-68|url=|journal=East European Politics and Societies|volume=19|issue=2|pages=185-225|via=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1968 student-led demonstrations in Warsaw (''see [[Polish 1968 political crisis]]'') gave Gomułka's government an excuse to try and channel public anti-government sentiment into another avenue. Thus his security chief, [[Mieczysław Moczar]], used the situation as a pretext to launch an antisemitic press campaign (although the expression "Zionist" was officially used). The state-sponsored "anti-Zionist" campaign resulted in the removal of Jews from the [[Polish United Worker's Party]] and from teaching positions in schools and universities. In 1967–1971 under economic, political and secret police pressure, over 14,000 Polish Jews chose to leave Poland and relinquish their Polish citizenship.&lt;ref name="Steinman2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louise Steinman|title=The Crooked Mirror: A Memoir of Polish-Jewish Reconciliation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhbqt0mk-KYC&amp;pg=PT134|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-5056-9|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, it was said that they chose to go to Israel. However, only about 4,000 actually went there; most settled throughout [[Europe]] and in the [[United States]]. The leaders of the Communist party tried to stifle the ongoing protests and unrest by scapegoating the Jews. At the same time there was an ongoing power struggle within the party itself and the antisemitic campaign was used by one faction against another. The so-called "Partisan" faction blamed the Jews who had held office during the Stalinist period for the excesses that had occurred, but the end result was that most of the remaining Polish Jews, regardless of their background or political affiliation, were targeted by the communist authorities.&lt;ref&gt;AP Online, "Some Jewish exiles to have Polish citizenship restored this week", 03-10-1998, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19804342.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several outcomes of the ''[[March 1968 events]]''. The campaign damaged Poland's reputation abroad, particularly in the U.S. Many Polish intellectuals, however, were disgusted at the promotion of official antisemitism and opposed the campaign. Some of the people who emigrated to the West at this time founded organizations which encouraged anti-Communist opposition inside Poland.

First attempts to improve Polish-Israeli relations began in the mid-1970s. Poland was the first of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries to restore diplomatic relations with Israel after these have been broken off right after the Six-Day's War.&lt;ref name="relations"/&gt; In 1986 [[Israel–Poland relations|partial diplomatic relations with Israel]] were restored,&lt;ref name=relations/&gt; and full relations were restored in 1990 as soon as communism fell.

During the late 1970s some Jewish activists were engaged in the anti-Communist opposition groups. Most prominent among them, [[Adam Michnik]] (founder of ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'') was one of the founders of the [[Workers' Defence Committee]] (KOR). By the time of the fall of Communism in Poland in 1989, only 5,000–10,000 Jews remained in the country, many of them preferring to conceal their Jewish origin.

==Since 1989==
{{main article|History of Poland (1989–present)}}
{{Details|Jewish Polish history (1989–present)}}
With the fall of communism in Poland, Jewish cultural, social, and religious life has been undergoing a revival. Many historical issues, especially related to World War II and the 1944–89 period, suppressed by Communist censorship, have been re-evaluated and publicly discussed (like the Jedwabne pogrom, the [[Koniuchy massacre]], the [[Kielce pogrom]], the [[Auschwitz cross]], and Polish-Jewish wartime relations in general).

In a 2005 survey commissioned by [[Anti-Defamation League]] from New York in 12 European countries, asking about selective stereotypes among 500 callers each, Polish respondents averaged 52% at question #1, 43% at #2, 43% at #3, 52% at #4 and 39% at #5 (the highest) asked if "The Jews are responsible for the death of Christ", with the lowest percentage of believers that Israeli actions were responsible for violence against European Jews (21% at question #7) among all of the 12 countries surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061130062547/https://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASInt_13/4726_13.htm ADL Survey in 12 European Countries Finds Anti-Semitic Attitudes Still Strongly Held] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103221942/http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASInt_13/4726_13.htm |date=2013-01-03 }}.

The Chief Rabbi of Poland, [[Michael Schudrich]], said in a [[BBC]] interview: "it's ... false and painful stereotype that all Poles are antisemitic. This is something I want to clearly state: this is a false stereotype. Today there is antisemitism in Poland, as unfortunately the rest of Europe; it is more or less at the same level as the rest of Europe. More important is that you have a growing number of Poles who oppose antisemitism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8333000/8333370.stm Kaminski 'today against anti-semitism', BBC ''Today'' Programme, 30 October 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Alina Cała]], in 1968 the Moczarite faction transposed the Jewish victims of the Holocaust with their persecutors, accusing the Jews of support for the Nazis. While this faction was suppressed and broken up after one year, no attempt was taken to combat antisemitism and this propaganda has had long lasting effects in Polish society. Cała sees modern antisemitism in Poland as a mix of pre-war anti-communist propaganda augmented by Moczarite propaganda whose communist roots are clearly evident. According to Cała since 2007 antisemitism has been on the decline in Poland, though still evident in Polish discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528215230/http://jsantisemitism.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Denying-the-Holocaust-in-Poland.pdf |title=Denying the Holocaust in Poland |first=Alina |last=Cała |authorlink=Alina Cała |year=2015 |journal=[[Journal for the Study of Antisemitism]] |volume=7 |number=2 |accessdate=July 4, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish religious life has been revived with the help of the [[Ronald Lauder Foundation]] and the [[Taube Foundation for Jewish Life &amp; Culture]]. There are two rabbis serving the Polish Jewish community, several Jewish schools and associated summer camps as well as several periodical and book series sponsored by the above foundations. Jewish studies programs are offered at major universities, such as [[Warsaw University]] and the [[Jagiellonian University]]. The [[Union of Jewish Religious Communities in Poland]] was founded in 1993. Its purpose is the promotion and organization of Jewish religious and cultural activities in Polish communities.

A large number of cities with synagogues include Warsaw, Kraków, [[Zamość]], [[Tykocin]], [[Rzeszów]], [[Kielce]], or [[Góra Kalwaria]] although not many of them are still active in their original religious role. Stara Synagoga ("Old Synagogue") in Kraków, which hosts a Jewish museum, was built in the early 15th century and is the oldest synagogue in Poland. Before the war, the Yeshiva Chachmei in Lublin was Europe's largest. In 2007 it was renovated, dedicated and reopened thanks to the efforts and endowments by Polish Jewry. Warsaw has an active synagogue, [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue|Beit Warszawa]], affiliated with the Liberal-Progressive stream of Judaism.

There are also several Jewish publications although most of them are in Polish. These include ''[[Midrasz]]'', ''Dos Jidische Wort'' (which is bilingual), as well as a youth journal ''Jidele'' and "Sztendlach" for young children. Active institutions include the Jewish Historical Institute, the E.R. Kaminska State Yiddish Theater in Warsaw, and the Jewish Cultural Center. The [[Judaica Foundation]] in Kraków has sponsored a wide range of cultural and educational programs on Jewish themes for a predominantly Polish audience. With funds from the city of Warsaw and the Polish government ($26 million total) a [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]] is being built in Warsaw. The building was designed by the Finnish architect Rainer Mahlamäki.&lt;ref name="Weiner"/&gt;

Former extermination camps of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek and Treblinka are open to visitors. At Auschwitz the Oświęcim State Museum currently houses exhibitions on Nazi crimes with a special section (Block Number 27) specifically focused on Jewish victims and martyrs. At Treblinka there is a monument built out of many shards of broken stone, as well as a mausoluem dedicated to those who perished there. A small mound of human ashes commemorates the 350,000 victims of the Majdanek camp who were killed there by the Nazis. [[Jewish Cemetery, Łódź]] is one of the largest Jewish burial grounds in Europe, and preserved historic sites include those located in Góra Kalwaria and [[Leżajsk]] ([[Elimelech of Lizhensk|Elimelech's of Lizhensk]] [[ohel (grave)|ohel]]).&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt;

The Great Synagogue in [[Oświęcim]] was excavated after testimony by a Holocaust survivor suggested that many Jewish relics and ritual objects had been buried there, just before Nazis took over the town. Candelabras, chandeliers, a menorah and a ner tamid were found and can now be seen at the Auschwitz Jewish Center.&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt;

The [[Warsaw Ghetto Memorial]] was unveiled on April 19, 1948—the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw ghetto Uprising. It was constructed out of bronze and granite that the Nazis used for a monument honoring German victory over Poland and it was designed by [[Natan Rappaport]]. The Memorial is located where the Warsaw Ghetto used to be, at the site of one command bunker of the [[Jewish Combat Organization]].

A memorial to the victims of the Kielce Pogrom of 1946, where a mob murdered more than 40 Jews who returned to the city after the Holocaust, was unveiled in 2006. The funds for the memorial came from the city itself and from the [[U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad]].

In modern Poland, interest in learning about and preserving the artifacts of Jewish culture is quite strong, especially among the younger generations.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Many works devoted to the Holocaust have been published. Notable among them are the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]'s journal Zaglada (first issue, 2005) as well as other publications from the [[Institute of National Remembrance]].

There have been a number of Holocaust remembrance activities in Poland in recent years. The [[United States Department of State]] documents that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In September 2000, dignitaries from Poland, Israel, the United States, and other countries (including [[Prince Hassan of Jordan]]) gathered in the city of Oświęcim (Auschwitz) to commemorate the opening of the refurbished [[Chevra Lomdei Mishnayot synagogue]] and the [[Auschwitz Jewish Center]]. The synagogue, the sole synagogue in Oświęcim to survive World War II and an adjacent Jewish cultural and educational center, provide visitors a place to pray and to learn about the active pre–World War II Jewish community that existed in Oświęcim. The synagogue was the first communal property in the country to be returned to the Jewish community under the 1997 law allowing for restitution of Jewish communal property.&lt;ref name="Poland, International Religious Freedom Report"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[March of the Living]] is an event held each year in April to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust. It takes place from Auschwitz to [[Auschwitz II|Birkenau]] and is attended by many people from Israel, Poland and other countries. The marchers honor [[Holocaust Remembrance Day]] as well as [[Israel Independence Day]].

In 2006, Poland's Jewish population was estimated to be approximately 20,000;&lt;ref name="polish-jewish-heritage.org"/&gt; most living in Warsaw, [[Wrocław]], [[Kraków]], and [[Bielsko-Biała]], though there are no census figures that would give an exact number. According to the Polish [[Moses Schorr Centre]] and other Polish sources, however, this may represent an undercount of the actual number of Jews living in Poland, since many are not religious.&lt;ref name="beitkrakow"/&gt;  There are also people with Jewish roots who do not possess adequate documentation to confirm it, due to various historical and family complications.&lt;ref name="beitkrakow"/&gt; A special program of introduction to Judaism is offered to them by a progressive Jewish Community Beit Kraków.&lt;ref name="beitkrakow"&gt;[http://beitkrakow.pl/konwersja/ Beit Kraków » Wstęp do Judaizmu (Introduction to Judaism): "Korzenie" (Roots).] August 31, 2009.

According to an ADL report released in 2012, based on telephone survey of 500 adults in Poland (out of the total number of 5,000 adults polled by Ipsos-Reid in 10 European countries), 54% of Poles continue to believe in some anti-Semitic stereotypes. The percentage is down from similar survey conducted in 2009. For instance, with regard to a question of whether "Jews have too much power in the business world", Poles surveyed ranked the third-highest after Hungary (73%) and Spain (60%). On another question regarding loyalty of their Jewish citizens, the surveyed Poles answered at par with Italians at 61% (overall, more than half of all European respondents gave the same answer).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/study-reveals-rising-anti-semitism-in-europe/  Anti-Semitism on the rise in France, new ADL survey shows.] ''The Times of Israel'', 2012.

People who hold such beliefs are also unwilling to vote for a political candidate with Jewish origins or to accept a Jew in their closest environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bilewicz|first1=Michal|last2=Winiewski|first2=M.|last3= Kofta |first3=M.|last4= Wójcik|first4= A|title=Harmful Ideas, The Structure and Consequences of Anti-Semitic Beliefs in Poland|journal=Political Psychology|date=November 6, 2013|volume=34|pages=821–839|doi=10.1111/pops.12024|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12024/pdf|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study's results were presented to the Polish [[Sejm]] (parliament) in January 2014 and were well received by most of its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/191155/poland-poll-reveals-stubborn-anti-semitism-amid-je/?p=all|title=Poland Poll Reveals Stubborn Anti-Semitism Amid Jewish Revival Hopes|publisher=[[The Forward]]|date=2014-01-14|accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of 2014, a study conducted by Warsaw University Center for Research on Prejudice found out that more than half of Polish youth visit anti-Semitic websites that glorify Hitler and the Nazi era.

However, most sources other than [[YIVO]] give a larger number of Jews living in contemporary Poland.

&lt;ref name="Note"&gt;Although traditional narrative holds that as a consequence, the predicament of the Commonwealth’s Jewry worsened, declining to the level of other European countries by the end of the eighteenth century, recent scholarship by Gershon Hundert, Moshe Rosman, Edward Fram, and Magda Teter, suggest that the reality was much more complex. See for example, the following works, which discuss Jewish life and culture, as well as Jewish-Christian relations during that period: M. Rosman ''Lords' Jews: Magnate-Jewish Relations in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Eighteenth Century'' (Harvard University Press, new ed. 1993), G. Hundert ''The Jews in a Polish Private Town: The Case of Opatów in the Eighteenth Century'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), E.Fram ''Ideals Face Reality: Jewish Law and Life in Poland, 1550–1655'' (HUC Press, 1996), and M. Teter''Jews and Heretics in Pre-modern Poland: A Beleaguered Church in the Post-Reformation Era'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jian Youwen''' (1896 &amp;ndash; 1978 {{zh|t=簡又文 |s=简又文 |p=Jiăn Yòuwén|w=Chien Yu-wen|j=Gaan&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Jau&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Man&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, sometimes transliterated '''Jen Yu-wen''' or '''Kan Yau-man''' in older documents) was a Chinese historian, public official, and sometime [[Methodism#China|Methodist pastor]], known in particular for his writings on the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]]. He taught at [[Yenching University]], the [[University of Hong Kong]], and [[Yale University]].

== Life and career==
Jian was born in [[Guangdong]] in 1896, the son of [[Jian Yinchu]] and [[Jian Wenliu]], and educated at Lingnan School, where he was baptized as a Christian. His older brother, [[Kan Tat-Choy]], became a wealthy entrepreneur and later built [[St. Mary's Episcopal Church (Hong Kong)|St. Mary's Episcopal Church]] in [[Causeway Bay]]. In 1914, Jian attended [[Oberlin College]] where he earned his undergraduate degree in 1917, and obtained his master's degree from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1919, then returned to China in 1921. In 1922, he accepted a position as General Editor at the [[Hong Kong YMCA]]'s publications division, and in 1924 was appointed associate professor of religion at [[Yenching University]], a post he held until 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Dong Feng and Chi-wah Chan, "Biographical Sketch" in the Yale Jen Yu-Wen Papers&lt;/ref&gt;

Jian joined the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party]] in 1926 and developed a close relationship with General [[Feng Yuxiang]], the "Christian Warlord", who appointed him head of his political department{{what|date=August 2018}} in 1927. After that party formed a government the same year, ushering what is known as the [[Nanjing decade]], Jian held a variety of posts including [[salt commissioner]], overseeing the [[Salt in Chinese history|traditional salt monopoly]]. His interest in politics grew, and from 1933 to 1946 he was a member of the [[Legislative Yuan]]. He recalled his experiences with the Kuomintang in his biography, 西北从军记 (''Xibei congjun ji'', ''Record of my military days in the northwest''), which was published posthumously in 1982.

Jian’s work in [[Chinese culture]] brought him close to many important artists. While in [[Mengshan County|Mengshan]], he served as a private tutor to the young [[Chen Wentong]], who later gained fame as a ''[[wuxia]]'' writer under the pen name [[Liang Yusheng]]. He was a student and later close friend to the artist [[Gao Jianfu]] and, according to [[Eliza Ho]], was an important influence on his work. In 1954, he wrote the libretto for a [[Cantonese opera]] with nationalist themes, 萬世流芳張玉喬 (''The Immortal Zhang Yuqiao, the Most Respectable Courtesan''). The opera is considered a contemporary classic of Chinese opera, and was premiered in the same year by the Sun Yim Yeung troupe.&lt;ref&gt;Yung Sai-Shing, "Cantonese Opera and Nationalism: A Classic Work Reinterpreted", [http://www.ln.edu.hk/ihss/crd/intangible.html public lecture] delivered on February 27–28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The production was directed by the celebrated composer and film director [[Tang Ti-sheng]]. He also found time to publish and edit two important literary magazines, 易經 (''Yijing'', in Shanghai and edited by Yao Xiexing),&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4e4a788a0100fnne.html 关于简又文創办的《逸经》雜志], accessed March 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Typhoon'' (in Hong Kong) during the 1930s. ''Yijing'' had a partial focus on humor, and Jian launched the journal in 1933 in coordination with the launch of 宇宙鋒 (''[[Yuzhou Feng]]'', ''Cosmic (sword) Edge'') by his friend and colleague [[Lin Yutang]]. Consequently, 1933 was commonly described in Chinese literary circles as "The Year of Humor".&lt;ref&gt;Qian Suoqiao, "Discovering Humor in Modern China: The launching of the ''Analects Fortnightly'' journal and the "Year of Humor" (1933)", in J Chey and JM Davis, eds., ''Humour in Chinese Life and Letters: Classical and Traditional Approaches''. Hong Kong University Press: 2011, p. 191. {{ISBN|9789888083527}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sohigian, Dirhan John, "Contagion of Laughter: The Rise of the Humor Phenomenon in Shanghai in the 1930s", ''positions'' Spring 2007 15(1): 137-163&lt;/ref&gt; Socially, Jian was renowned as a talented reteller of the coarse humor of the traitor [[Han Fuju#Career|Han Fuju]].&lt;ref&gt;Lary, Diana. ''The Chinese People at War: Human Suffering and Social Transformation, 1937-1945''., Cambridge UP: 2010, p.139 {{ISBN|0521144108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1946, he founded and became first director-general of the Guangdong Institute of History and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;”Chien Yu-Wen”, in the ''Biographical Dictionary of Republican China'', Columbia University Press: 1971 {{ISBN|0231089589}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Jian returned to Hong Kong where he became a professor at [[Hong Kong University]]. He was a visiting fellow at [[Yale]] from 1964 to 1965, the institution that now houses the Jen Yu-Wen Papers. He died in Hong Kong in 1978. His wife, Mabel Yuk-Sein Young, with whom he had two sons and two daughters, died in 1958.

==Academic work==
Jian was renowned mainly for his expertise on the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]], and was one of the first scholars to take a serious interest in the period.&lt;ref&gt;Lone, Stewart. ''Daily Lives of Civilians in Wartime Asia: From the Taiping Rebellion to the Vietnam War''. Greenwood Press: 2007, {{ISBN|0313336849}}, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;  His ''Taiping tianguo dianzhi tongkao'' (太平天國典制通考) was published as a three-volume work in Hong Kong by Mengjin Shuwu in 1957, and by Yale University as a single volume in 1978, translated by [[William John Francis Jenner|W J F Jenner]] as ''The Taiping Revolutionary Movement''. He wrote several other works on the Taiping period, all of which are considered authoritative.&lt;ref&gt;Uhalley, Stephen, "The Significance of Jen Yu-wen's Magnum Opus on the Taipings". ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 33, No. 4 (Aug., 1974), pp. 679-685&lt;/ref&gt;

Jian, an esteemed art collector of works from the [[Ming Dynasty painting|Ming]] and [[Chinese art#Early Qing painting|Qing]] Dynasties, and of Guangdong art,&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, R. ''Art &amp; Revolution in Modern China: The Lingnan (Cantonese) School of Painting 1906-1951''. University of California Press: 1988, {{ISBN|0520059093}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was the largest collector of Gao Jianfu's work, and assembled them as the "pavilion of one hundred swords" (百劍樓, ''Bǎi jiàn lōu''), a collection which formed the basis of his 1972 chronology of Gao. Unfortunately, financial difficulties in the 1970s forced him to sell part of the collection through [[Sotheby's]]. His work on Gao's art has formed the basis of commentary since, and also ties into his work on the Taipings by emphasizing the "revolutionary" dimension of the culture of Guangdong, or its frequent role as a cradle of cultural and political innovation in China. He described Guangdong as "the origin of revolution" (革命筞涴地, ''gémìng cèyuàndì''), and in the 1940s was active in the promotion of [[Guangdongese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Ho, Eliza. "From xin guohua (new national painting) to the founder of the Lingnan School: transformation of the representations of Gao Jianfu and his art by a regional discourse”&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of his art collection now resides at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], in its Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.cuhk.edu.hk/english/publications/newsletter/article.aspx?articleid=17867 Interview with professor James Watt], accessed 2012-03-06&lt;/ref&gt; This single gift of over one thousand items [[Art Museum of the Chinese University of Hong Kong#Collections|constitutes the core]] of the Art Museum's holdings.

==Religious beliefs==
Jian was a devout Christian, not only in his personal affairs but especially in public life. His interest in the Taipings was in part stimulated by their unusual adoption of Christian beliefs, but he also argued strenuously for the gradual Christianization of China. He wrote essays against the Anti-Christian movement in China, and translated [[Marshall Broomhall]]'s biography of [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]], the first Protestant missionary to the country, as well as biologist [[John Merle Coulter]]'s ''Religion and Science''. Countering the perception that Christianity, as a western faith, was harmful to China, Jian argued that Christianity could be shaped as a revolutionary force in a republican China.&lt;ref&gt;Pan-Chiu Lai and Jason Lam, ''Sino-Christian theology: a theological qua cultural movement in contemporary China''. Peter Lang ed, 2010. {{ISBN|3631604351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His best-known concrete action in this regard occurred when he became Director of the [[Guangzhou Bureau of Social Affairs]] in 1931. He inherited a proposal from his predecessor to convert the Guangzhou [[City god]] temple, which he saw as a relic of a superstitious and backward era, into a secular facility to promote the consumption of goods produced in Guangdong. Although the provincial government supported the change, the conversion was highly unpopular with local citizens and in particular the temple's [[fortune-tellers]], who alternately threatened and bribed Jian. Nonetheless he prevailed; the temple was converted, and many of its artefacts were dispersed to local government offices and the [[YMCA]].&lt;ref&gt;Poon, Shuk-Wah.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period followed three [[List of large volcanic eruptions|immense volcanic eruptions]] in 536, 540 and 547. One of the suspected volcanic sites for those events is the [[Rabaul caldera]], in the western Pacific, which erupted around 540. The [[extreme weather events of 535–536]] were the early phenomena of the century-long global temperature decline.

The evidence comes from a temperature reconstruction from the Euro-Med2k working group of the international PAGES (Past Global Changes) project, using new tree-ring measurements from the [[Altai Mountains]], which closely matches the temperatures in the [[Alps]] in the last two centuries.&lt;ref name=Buntgen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagedaily.com/2016/02/new-little-ice-age-coincides-with-fall-of-eastern-roman-empire-and-growth-of-arab-empire/109599|title=New 'Little Ice Age' coincides with fall of Eastern Roman Empire and growth of Arab Empire|work=Heritage Daily|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]], 1st  Duke of Bronté''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KB2}} (29 September 1758&amp;nbsp;– 21 October 1805) was one of the leading [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[flag officer]]s in the [[Royal Navy]] of the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], responsible for several important victories over the French and Spanish navies during a time of crisis for the country. He was widely lauded for his success, and praised for his skill and daring. After his death during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], he became revered as a British hero, and his fame reached new heights. Large numbers of [[Monuments and memorials to Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|monuments and memorials]] have been created in his honour, and he has continued to influence British culture and society.

==Background==
The [[French Revolution]] and the subsequent conflicts transformed the old systems of protocols of warfare. Whereas wars had previously been fought to inflict losses that would compel the enemy to seek peace, and concede some losses in the subsequent negotiations, it now became about destroying rival states and thoroughly subjugating them.&lt;ref name="LambertXVII"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=XVII}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] system terrified the property owning members of the British establishment, and resulted in a wave of patriotism, which manifested itself in the creation of a militarised society based on local [[militia]]s and volunteer forces.&lt;ref name="LambertXIX"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=XIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With early French victories in the [[Low Countries]], and large forces stationed at the Channel ports, there was the very real risk on invasion. For the first time since the [[Spanish Armada]], Britain felt that it was in a war of national survival.&lt;ref name="LambertXIX"/&gt; Together the French and Spanish fleets considerably outnumbered the British.&lt;ref name="LambertXX"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=XX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Navy]] was the main instrument of defence for the country, but it was a highly professionalised and modern service. In contrast, the French Navy was poorly led, early purges having cost a number of experienced officers and admirals, whilst the Spanish had a large force and skilled leaders, but few sailors. The Russian and Danish forces, while numerically significant, were vastly inferior in quality.&lt;ref name="LambertXX"/&gt;  But while the French Army was able to achieve a number of victories on land, the Royal Navy was able to harass French possessions, intercept French trade and capture French colonies.&lt;ref name="LambertXXVII"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=XXVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The expansion of the navy brought a number of officers and commanders to prominence, but none achieved the level of fame and adulation that Nelson secured.&lt;ref name="LambertXXVIII"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=XXVIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Trafalgar==
[[File:Apotheosis of Nelson.jpg|right|thumb|Scott Pierre Nicolas Legrand's ''Apotheosis of Nelson''. Nelson ascends into immortality as the Battle of Trafalgar rages in the background. He is supported by [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], whilst [[Pheme|Fame]] holds a crown of stars as a symbol of immortality over Nelson's head. A grieving [[Britannia]] holds out her arms, whilst [[Hercules]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Minerva]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] look on.]]
Nelson's death in the cockpit of his [[flagship]] {{HMS|Victory}} has been described by [[Andrew Lambert]] as 'the ideal romantic death'.&lt;ref name="Lambert313"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was mortally wounded by an enemy [[sniper]], dying slowly and remaining conscious throughout, surrounded by his chaplain and staff officers. His last thoughts covered matters such as final directions for his fleet, his hopes and fears for his family, and his personal desire for absolution and reassurance.&lt;ref name="Lambert313"/&gt; The events were recorded by several of those present, including the surgeon, [[William Beatty (surgeon)|William Beatty]], and later interpreted in dramatic paintings, both of the death scene, such as those by [[Benjamin West]], and [[Arthur William Devis]], and of allegorical depictions of Nelson's ascent into immortality as a result of his glorious death, including works by West, and Scott Legrand. When news arrived in Britain the initial joy at the news of the victory was stifled by the report of his death, and a [[state funeral]] was immediately planned.&lt;ref name="Lambert312"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson was to be buried in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], in a grand ceremony that was not just a mere funeral but was intended to 'capture the essence, the spirit, and the name of Nelson for the nation.'&lt;ref name="Lambert313"/&gt; A special coffin was devised, heavily decorated with emblems and symbols of Nelson's many victories. It enclosed the simpler coffin, given to Nelson by [[Benjamin Hallowell Carew|Benjamin Hallowell]], and was itself enclosed in a grand sarcophagus made for [[Cardinal Wolsey]].&lt;ref name="Lambert314"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Nelson was laid in state at [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]], a crowd of 30,000 arrived to pay their respects. The subsequent funeral was one of the grandest ever staged, costing some £14,000 and attended by large numbers of admirals, captains and members of royalty.&lt;ref name="Lambert316"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorian era==
By 1865, Nelson had been humanised by the British public, and his heroic status began to be reduced in comparison to newer military commanders, some of whom explicitly incorporated elements of Nelsonian tradition.&lt;ref name="Lambert337"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Franco-Prussian War]] reduced any potential threat that France might have offered, while the liberalising [[Prime Minister]] [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s policies saw the reduction of the navy as part of defence cuts. Gladstone's opponent, the [[Poet Laureate]] [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]], appealed to the image and tradition of Nelson, and stressed the importance of the Navy to the defence of the country.&lt;ref name="Lambert340"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1890s saw another revival in interest, with several new biographies. Nelson featured in school text books as an idealised British hero, but the more controversial aspects of his life were ignored.&lt;ref name="Lambert340"/&gt; In 1891 a grand exhibition of Nelson's life opened, and was visited by nearly two and half million people in the six months it was open for.&lt;ref name="Lambert340"/&gt; The formation of the Navy League in 1894 gave added impetus to the movement to recognise Nelson's legacy, and grand celebrations were held in Trafalgar Square on Trafalgar Day, 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Curiosities of popular customs and of rites, ceremonies, observances, and miscellaneous antiquities | author=Walsh, William Shephard | publisher=J.B. Lippincott Co. | year=1897 | page=940 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKwYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
[[File:My ships have passed away.jpg|thumb|A 1905 cartoon from ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. Nelson looks over the modern ships of the Royal Navy and says 'My ships have passed away, but the spirit of my men remains'. In the centenary of Nelson's death, leading figures in the Admiralty such as Lord Fisher stressed the legacy of Nelson.]]
The signing of the [[Triple Entente]] in 1904 led to a call for muted celebrations of the centenary of Trafalgar the following year to avoid offending the French.&lt;ref name="Lambert344"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some navy officers continued to emphasise the importance of Nelson, [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]] chose 21 October 1904 as the day to take up the office of [[First Sea Lord]], and was fond of citing Nelson when implementing changes to the Navy. He also oversaw the naming of many navy ships after ships that had been at Trafalgar, or other Nelsonian battles, such as {{HMS|Bellerophon|1907|6}}, {{HMS|Temeraire|1907|6}} and {{HMS|Superb|1907|6}}; or after events or people in some way connected with him, such as {{HMS|Collingwood|1908|6}} and {{HMS|St. Vincent|1908|6}}. In many ways Fisher was preparing for a second Trafalgar.&lt;ref name="Lambert346"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had even selected a new Nelson to lead the new Nelsonian style navy, [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]], of whom he wrote &lt;blockquote&gt;Sir John Jellicoe. Phenomenally young and junior. He will be Nelson at Cape St Vincent until he becomes "Boss" at Trafalgar when Armageddon comes along in 1915 or thereabouts - not sooner!&lt;ref name="Lambert347"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nelson's legacy was also influential in the [[Second World War]], inspiring [[Winston Churchill]], who had written about him in his ''[[History of the English Speaking Peoples]]''. Churchill kept a bust of Nelson in his study at [[Chartwell]], and named his [[Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office|cat]] Nelson. He also declared ''[[That Hamilton Woman]]'' his favourite film, and often showed it to visiting naval officers.&lt;ref name="Lambert354"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The example of Nelson inspired the population as a whole, and a number of Nelsonian biographies were reprinted during the war.&lt;ref name="Lambert354"/&gt;  The post war era saw the decline of British power, which had been pre-eminent since Nelson's time. Despite a large new biography by Carola Oman in 1946, the figure of Nelson seemed out of touch with post war austerity.

However, Nelson's legacy has endured. In the [[BBC]]'s ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]'' programme in 2002, Nelson was voted the 9th greatest Briton of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2509465.stm|title= Churchill voted greatest Briton|accessdate=2008-10-16 |work= |publisher= bbc.co.uk|date= 24 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bicentenary of the Battle of Trafalgar in 2005 led to a round of celebrations under the banner of '[[Trafalgar 200]]'. An [[International Fleet Review 2005|International Fleet Review]] was held, and several new biographies and histories of the battle were published.  Phrases such as "[[England expects]]" and [[Nelson (cricket)|"nelson" (meaning "111")]] continue to remain closely associated with English sporting teams, especially [[cricket]].

==Depictions==

===Art===
After the arrival of ''Victory'' at [[Portsmouth]], large numbers of artists arrived to prepare sketches for their interpretations of the battle, and Nelson's death. [[Arthur William Devis]] and [[Benjamin West]] competed to create the grandest scene of the death, with West also painting his ''Apotheosis of Nelson''. [[J. M. W. Turner]] also visited the ''Victory'' to gather material for his paintings of the battle. The caricaturist [[James Gilray]] produced some of the earliest works in the aftermath of the battle, but his works were considerably more respectful than many of his satirical attacks on public figures.&lt;ref name="Lambert318"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of prints were also quickly produced to capitalised on public interest. In the 1840s [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] became interested in naval history, and commissioned several works, including ones depicting Nelson's victories, for the Royal palaces.&lt;ref name="Lambert333"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Maclise]] duly designed and painted an enormous fresco for the Royal Gallery at Westminster.

===Literature===
Hastily written tributes appeared across the country immediately after the news arrived, in papers, pamphlets and books.  [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], then at [[Naples]], produced an obituary essay on the death of [[Alexander Ball]], one of Nelson's captains whom he had known, and commented on Nelson's qualities.&lt;ref name="Lambert322"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official biography was written by John McArthur and [[James Stanier Clarke]] and published in 1809.&lt;ref name="Lambert323"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a work by [[Robert Southey]] in 1813, and [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] wrote in his 1819 poem ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' that 'Nelson was Britannia's god of war'.&lt;ref name="Lambert326"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1840s [[Nicholas Harris Nicolas]] drew up and published Nelson's collected correspondence.&lt;ref name="Lambert331"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s earliest works included a brief biographical sketch of Nelson, and he returned to consider Nelson in his 1839 work ''Heroes and Hero Worship''.&lt;ref name="Lambert334"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Pettigrew]], capitalising on a resurgence of interest in Nelson, produced a new biography in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="Lambert335"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. K. Laughton]] produced several works on Nelson in the late 19th century, and in 1897 [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] published his ''Life of Nelson'', which rapidly became a best seller.&lt;ref name="Lambert342"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monuments===
[[File:Lord Nelson, Nelson's Column.JPG|right|thumb|Nelson's Column was created to honour Nelson, and deliberately drew parallels with Roman monuments.]]
{{main|Monuments and memorials to Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson}}
[[Dublin]] was the first city to create its own monument to Nelson, with work beginning on [[Nelson's Pillar]] in 1808.&lt;ref name="Lambert327"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liverpool]] followed suit in 1813, and soon monuments had been erected in cities across the empire, including the [[Norfolk]] town on [[Great Yarmouth]] in 1819.&lt;ref name="Lambert328"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of a memorial in London had been discussed in 1816, but it was not until the 1830s that a programme of [[slum clearance]] created a suitable location, which was renamed [[Trafalgar Square]] in 1835.&lt;ref name="Lambert328"/&gt; The [[Nelson's Column|column]] itself was designed by [[William Railton]] and modelled on a column in the Temple of Mars Ultor, in [[Rome]]. The Temple had been built to celebrate the transformation of the late military leader [[Julius Caesar]] into a god. The treatment accorded to Nelson established clear parallels, and compared the triumph of the [[Roman Empire]] with the triumph of the British over the French.&lt;ref name="Lambert328"/&gt; The square and column were completed by 1843, with the final addition of Sir [[Edwin Landseer]]'s lions coming several years later.

===Music===
[[John Braham]]'s song, ''The Death of Nelson'', written immediately after Trafalgar, became extremely popular. [[Lennox Berkeley]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Nelson (opera)|Nelson]]'' premièred in 1954. [[Joseph Haydn]]'s ''[[Missa in Angustiis]]'' is popularly known as the ''Nelson Mass''. Nelson "on board of the ''Victory''" is also mentioned at the beginning the song "If you Want a Receipt for that Popular Mystery" sung by Colonel Calverley in the operetta ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert|Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]].

===Nelson in contemporary fiction===
Nelson appears in [[Susan Sontag]]'s novel ''[[The Volcano Lover: A Romance]]'', and as a ghost in [[Amber Benson]]'s and [[Christopher Golden]]'s ''[[Ghosts of Albion]]''. He appears several times in [[Dudley Pope]]'s [[Lord Ramage|Ramage]] series, and features in ''[[Sharpe's Trafalgar]]'' by [[Bernard Cornwell]]. Nelson is the object of the ardent admiration of Captain [[Jack Aubrey]] in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s [[Aubrey–Maturin series]]. In [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Nelson is referred to by the character [[Stephen Dedalus]] as the 'one-handled adulterer', when speaking of his namesake monument, [[Nelson's Pillar]]. Nelson features in [[James A Michener]]'s ''[[Caribbean (novel)|Caribbean]]'', and is referred to in [[Barry Unsworth]]'s novel ''[[Losing Nelson]]''. [[Naomi Novik]]'s alternate history/fantasy [[Temeraire (series)|Temeraire series]] suggests an alternate future in which Nelson survives Trafalgar.  A recently discovered [[Alexandre Dumas]] novel, [[The Knight of Sainte-Hermine]], portrays the title character as the shooter of Nelson.  The character of [[Horatio Hornblower]] in [[C. S. Forester]]'s series of books was partially inspired by Nelson.  &lt;ref&gt;C. S. Forester, ''The Hornblower Companion'', NY, 1964, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lennox Berkeley]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Nelson (opera)|Nelson]]'' premièred in 1954. Nelson also has cameos in the historical fiction of [[William C. Hammond]].

Nelson was portrayed on film by [[Laurence Olivier]] in ''[[That Hamilton Woman]]'' (1941), and also in the film ''[[The Young Mr. Pitt]]''. [[Peter Finch]] portrayed him in a 1973 film adaptation of [[Terence Rattigan]]'s 1970 stage play ''[[A Bequest to the Nation]]''. Nelson also appears as a minor character in [[Abel Gance]]'s ''Austerlitz'' (1960). In the 1961 television series, ''Triton'', Nelson was played by [[Robert James (actor)|Robert James]], and in a 1968 version of the same series, he was played by [[Terry Scully]]. 

Lord Nelson's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] was repeatedly lampooned in the 1980s [[sitcom]] [[Blackadder the Third]]. In the episode ''[[Ink and Incapability]]'', the show's [[antihero]], [[Mr. E. Blackadder]], mocks Nelson's [[England expects that every man will do his duty|famous signal]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. He announces that Nelson used a similar signal at the [[Battle of the Nile]]: "England knows [[Lady Hamilton]] is a [[virgin]]. Poke my eye out and cut off my arm if I'm wrong."

Lord Nelson also appears in the Georgian segment of ''[[Blackadder's Christmas Carol]]'' at a party hosted by the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]. Passed out from too much alcohol, Nelson suddenly awakens and screams that he has gone blind. Then, however, Blackadder reveals to Nelson that his eyepatch is simply on backwards. Relieved, Nelson returns to a drunken stupor.

==Nelson and the Royal Navy==
The Royal Navy have named a number of ships after Nelson or his victories. These have included {{HMS|Nelson}}, {{HMS|Lord Nelson}}, {{HMS|Nile}} and {{HMS|Trafalgar}}. The Royal Navy celebrates Nelson every 21 October by holding [[Trafalgar Night]] dinners and toasting ''"The Immortal Memory"'' of Nelson. His flagship ''Victory'' is still kept on active commission in honour of Nelson &amp;mdash; it is the flagship of the [[Second Sea Lord]], and is the oldest commissioned Naval ship in the world. She can be found in Number 2 Dry Dock of the [[Royal Naval Museum]] at the [[Portsmouth Naval Base]], in [[Portsmouth]], which is named HMS ''Nelson''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicdockyard.co.uk/hmsvictory/ |title=HMS ''Victory'' |publisher=Portsmouth Historic Dockyard |accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Victory'' was drydocked for restoration in 1922, and opened to the public as a shrine to Nelson and his navy in 1928.&lt;ref name="Lambert349"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert|title=Britannia's God of War|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nelsonia==
The bullet that killed Nelson is permanently on display in the Grand Vestibule of [[Windsor Castle]]. The uniform that he wore during the battle, with the fatal bullet hole still visible, can be seen at the [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich. A lock of Nelson's hair was given to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] from the Royal Navy after the [[Russo-Japanese War]] to commemorate the victory at the [[Battle of Tsushima]]. It is still on display at the [[Naval Academy Edashima|Edashima Naval Academy]], a public museum maintained by the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]].  Another may be seen in the dining room of the museum ship [[HMY Britannia|HMY ''Britannia'']], the former royal yacht, now permanently moored near [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].

This 1970s [[New Federalism]] style program promoted by the [[Nixon administration]] turned federal land over to the states for historical, cultural and recreational purposes.

In 1972, the U.S. Congress appropriated $200 million from the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund to support the program with the goal of conserving wild areas and saving the disappearing open spaces around the country's urban areas.  Local governments were able to obtain 50-50 matching funds for new parks, playgrounds, and open spaces with priority given to the development and improvement of land already in public ownership.  Special attention was given to projects that featured increasing the recreational use of the land.  

The program's guiding principle was rooted on the idea that America's highly diversified population deserved a variety of natural areas to enjoy; from parks with modern conveniences to areas featuring the solitude of wilderness.  Families, priests, casual tourists and avid outdoorsmen were viewed as having equal stakes in the parks.

To support the initiative, President Nixon asked for increases in funding for open space programs of the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] and established the Federal Property Review Board which evaluated federally owned land to determine if the parcels could be converted into parks. 

By the late 1970s, over 700,000,000 acres of land had been purchased under the Legacy of Parks program.  Playgrounds, forests, environmental education areas, bike trails, and jogging paths were all strong candidates for funding.  Many of the urban sites were less than {{convert|20|acre|m2}}.  Some parks were larger such as Michigan's 3,000 acre [[Fort Custer Recreation Area]] or New York and New Jersey's 26,600 acre [[Gateway National Recreation Area]].

A '''mansion stage''' is a stage for theatrical performances.  They originated in churches where they were small wooden platforms with supports and a roof.  Mansions were stage structures used in [[medieval theatre]] to represent specific locations, such as Heaven or Hell.  The actors would move between these mansions as the play demanded.  The acting area of the stage was called the platea, and mansions were placed around the platea.  As the actors moved between the mansions, the platea would take on the scenic identity of each mansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/463955/platea|title=platea - medieval theatre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In England, [[pageant wagon]]s were used for the cycle dramas to hold the mansion, the plateau, and a dressing area.  These were used to move the scene from one audience to the next, unlike in the church where the mansions were stationary and both the performer and the congregation would move from mansion to mansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msuiit.edu.ph/ipag/studies/drama/topics/medievaltheatre.html|title=Fernandez, Steven P.C. “Medieval Theatre.” IIT Quality Education for a Better Mindanao. Web. 29 Nov. 2010.|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociohistorical context ==
After the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], structured drama became practically nonexistent.  Theatrical performances persisted in some small degree through local and travelling troupes of what would later be called minstrels.  These minstrels, along with the monastery scholars, would carry the knowledge and tradition of the Roman Theatre until the revival of theatre in the Early Middle Ages, beginning around 500 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, Oscar G., and Franklin J. Hildy. History of the Theatre. Foundation ed. Boston, MA: Pearson, 2007. 74. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;   As the [[Roman Catholic Church|church]]’s power grew, they attempted to absorb the pagan religions.  In order to draw people in, while allowing them to keep a sense of their traditions, they superimposed Christian theology on pagan holiday celebrations.  Easter was already the appropriate time of year to take the place of the spring fertility festivals.  The Roman festivals celebrating the births of Dionysus, Osiris, and other lesser deities became Christmas, despite Christ’s birth never being celebrated in the winter before.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Brockett, Oscar G., and Franklin J. Hildy. History of the Theatre. Foundation ed. Boston, MA: Pearson, 2007. 76. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

To keep up with the elaborate and theatrical celebrations found in the pagan religions, the church began creating spectacle performances.   For example, they might place a cross wrapped in burial clothes in a tomb on [[Good Friday]] and raise it on Sunday,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; or stage elaborate mystery plays such as the one the lasted multiple days in the town of [[Mons, France]].{{clarify|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Crabtree, Susan, and Peter Beudert. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2005. 367. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;   The processionals evolved into the liturgical dramas of the high [[Middle Ages]].  By 1300, the performance of liturgical dramas in churches was widespread across Western Europe, and so began the use of mansions and plateas, which persisted throughout the Middle Ages.

In the 14th Century, the Church in England, in an attempt to continue to spark interest and devotion to the church, began to build movable mansions, called pageant wagons, to carry to different parts of town to create an elaborate travelling show.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/849217/Western-theatre|title=Western theatre - art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Carrying the performances out of the church, the play slowly became more secular.  Audiences prized the comic characters such as lesser demons and drunks,&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; and those who played them well, reigniting professionalism in performance.  The use of mansions, and eventually pageant wagons helped to create an affirmation of faith in the church in the Middle Ages.

==Specific characteristics of mansions ==
In the earliest days of [[liturgical drama]], plays were performed inside the church with limited scenery and the focus of the audience on the action.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, Oscar G., and Franklin J. Hildy. History of the Theatre. Foundation ed. Boston, MA: Pearson, 2007. 80. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;   Mansions were used to indicate location but much of the performance took place on the platea, the open space in front of the scenic structure, with the actors moving from mansion to mansion only when strictly necessary.  The increase in length of the plays and the inclusion of a wider variety of locations that needed to be represented by individual mansions was part of what caused the movement of performances from clergy control inside church spaces (where the mansions were nestled within structural arches or alcoves) to laity control outdoors in the streets or public squares.&lt;ref name="theatrehistory.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/medieval/medieval001d.html|title=The Medieval Drama - Page 4|website=www.theatrehistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This movement to the outdoors resulted in two different methods of staging: in England, mansions were converted into pageant wagons, which could be wheeled along in a parade-like fashion from audience to audience, while in France and the rest of continental Europe, the stations were more commonly lined up in an open square, sometimes on a u-shaped or circular platform, and the actors would move from mansion to mansion.  As time passed the plays came to be performed in the vernacular and required the involvement of community members, local guilds, and patronage from town government to produce the increasingly spectacular cycle, [[Mystery plays|mystery]], and [[Morality plays|morality]] plays.&lt;ref name="theatrehistory.com"/&gt;

Mansions, either stationary or moveable, represented a wide variety of locations such as the House of Adam, the Temple, the Garden of Gethsemane, and Mount Olivet, and were often lavishly decorated to add to the spectacle of the performance.  In the mystery play at Mons, France in 1501, five painters were hired to paint the 67 mansion stages with various pigments as well as varnish, gold leaf, and silver powder. They were also responsible for painting the backdrops, the furniture and other set pieces, and imitation draperies.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;   It is likely that because of the limited amount of total stage space, many of the mansion stages doubled for one another or were changed in between scenes.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Simonson, Lee. The Stage Is Set. Plainview, NY: for Libraries, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;   Flying machines, [[trapdoors]], rope-and-pulley systems, and special effects such as a dragon that spit fire, light shining from the manger in the Nativity and torrential rain for the creation of the world were popular.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;   Machinery or hidden sections such as Heaven would often be concealed with drapery or painted clouds, as was done in the Mons production.

A great number of people were employed in the production of these mansions, from Jehan de Dours, cabinetmaker, paid 48 sols for “making castles and turrets”, to Pierart Viscave, tinker, for installing sheets of metal to be used to create thunder effects, to Jehan du Fayt and seventeen assistants for working as stage hands for the nine-day performance.&lt;ref&gt;Simonson, Lee. The Stage Is Set. Plainview, NY: for Libraries, 1975. 176, 177, 181. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;   Both the production period and the performance of the outdoor vernacular medieval drama were extensive, with the 22 mansions for a production in Rouen prepared over 18 years.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;   These medieval spectacles laid the foundation for the flourishing of drama in the [[Renaissance]] of later centuries.

{{Marxism|Philosophy}}

Various Marxist authors have focused on Marx's method of analysis and presentation (historical materialist and logically dialectical) as key factors both in understanding the range and incisiveness of [[Karl Marx]]'s theoretical writing in general and ''{{lang|de|[[Das Kapital]]}}'' in particular. One of the clearest and most instructive examples of this is his discussion of ''the value-form'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx]] 'The Value-Form' [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm Appendix] to the 1st German edition of Capital, Volume 1, 1867&lt;/ref&gt; which acts as a primary guide or key to understanding the logical argument as it develops throughout the volumes of ''{{lang|de|Das Kapital}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl &amp; Engels, Frederick [1983] ''Letters on ‘Capital’'' New Park&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx himself presents a simplified explanation in the Appendix to the first German edition of ''{{lang|de|Das Kapital}}'' published in English translation in ''[[Capital &amp; Class]]''. The need for this appendix was suggested by Engels&lt;ref name="June16_1867"&gt;Engels to Marx, June 16, 1867 ''Letters on ‘Capital’''&lt;/ref&gt; and there is an exchange of correspondence&lt;ref name="June16_1867"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx to Engels, June 22, 1867 ''Letters on ‘Capital’''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engels to Marx, June 24, 1867 ''Letters on ‘Capital’''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx to Engels, June 27, 1867 ''Letters on ‘Capital’''&lt;/ref&gt; concerning its purpose and form.

The two principal components of marxist science are the dialectical method of logical deduction and genetic synthesis and its application to the evolution of real social history. While in each of these areas considered separately there are at least a number of scholarly works, there are few examples of substantial exegesis and fewer still successful applications of marxian method to the fundamental obstacles to class-consciousness today. This is reflected both at the general level of lack of understanding of the social nature of technological change embodied in Marx's theory of the value-form, reflected in widespread ignorance of the detail of the 'rational kernel' of Hegel's dialectic&lt;ref&gt;HEGEL's Logic [1975] Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; whose the principal 'forms of being' Marx used to structure the whole of the work on 'Capital'. His analytical evolution of the relation between subjective and objective development and their qualitative and quantitatively measured forms and functions which make up the logical skeleton in his presentation are almost universally ignored. Compare Hegel's Logic&lt;ref&gt;Hegel's Logic [1975] Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; for instance with Marx the value-form.&lt;ref&gt;Marx The value-form [1976]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than any other twentieth century marxist Lenin selfconsciously assimilated the fundamentals of this methodological approach (to the careful study of which he returned at the most critical political moments&lt;ref&gt;Lenin [1908] Collected Works v14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenin [1914-16] Collected Works v38&lt;/ref&gt; and set about the task of applying it to the 'burning questions of our movement'. His appreciation of the importance of the knowledge of real social movements is apparent from his studies: The development of Capitalism in Russia and his Notebooks on Imperialism.

Lukacs' revolutionary career is made more problematic by his intellectual capitulation to the pressures of stalinism. The essays from his period of active revolutionary leadership however are of unparalleled importance for their reassertion of Hegel's contribution to marxism. In addition his critical review of Bukharin published as Technology &amp; Social Relations&lt;ref&gt;Brewster, Ben (September–October 1966). "Introduction to Lukács on Bukharin". New Left Review. New Left Review. I (39).&lt;/ref&gt; remains of seminal importance as one of the few direct attempts to deal with the problem of the methodological degeneration of communist theory on this question utilising an adequate level of theoretical and historical understanding.

Rubin's 'Essays'&lt;ref&gt;Isaak Illich Rubin [1972] Essays on Marx’s Theory of Value Black &amp; Red&lt;/ref&gt; shared this appreciation of the weakness of communist theory (as did the work of KORSCH&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Korsch]] ''Three Essays on Marxism'' Pluto 1971&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; JAKUBOWSKI&lt;ref&gt;Franz Jakubowski 1976 'Ideology and Superstructure in Historical Materialism' Allison &amp; Busby&lt;/ref&gt;) but with the exceptions of [[Henryk Grossman]]'s work at the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research, and [[Evgeny Preobrazhensky]]'s New Economics, Rubin was in this period almost alone in articulating the central methodological content embodied in Marx's theoretical concepts. Roman Rosdolsky's valuable study The making of Marx's 'Capital' which re-emphasises the importance of use-value in Marx's two-fold analysis, was a result of his discovery of one of the rare copies of Grundrisse Marx's previously unpublished rough draft for 'Capital'.

Whereas Lenin had come to his understanding of the importance of Hegel's Logic by extensive study, Grossman's emphasis grew out of the need to re-articulate the structural method of 'Capital' in dealing with imperialism at the necessary level of theory. Rosdolsky was however able to read Marx directly asserting his enormous debt to Hegel and exploring out-loud the methodological problems of the relation between the investigation and presentation of his 'critique'.

Lukacs in 1930 had a similar experience in his reading of the then recently deciphered Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 on which he subsequently commented: "the overwhelming effect produced in me by Marx's statement that objectivity was the primary material attribute of all things and relations...that objectification is a natural means by which man masters the world and as such can be either a positive or a negative fact...it became clear to us that even the best and most capable Marxists, like Plekhanov and Mehring, had not had a sufficiently profound grasp of the universal nature of Marxism. They failed, therefore, to understand that Marx confronts us with the necessity of erecting a systematic aesthetics on the foundations of dialectical materialism.".&lt;ref&gt;Lukac's History and Class Consciousness [1971] p.xxxvi-ii&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this period that Lukacs began his twin study of The Young Hegel and The Destruction of Reason on the one hand looking at the contribution Hegel made to the rational scientific basis of dialectical materialism and on the other how in a direct reaction to the development of Marxism the irrationalist elements of Hegel's thought were promoted and the revolutionary critical element dismembered in the process of the degeneration of bourgeois philosophy.

The immediate post-war period produced little that was marxist by these criteria, with perhaps the sole exception of [[Paul Mattick]]'s essays which defended the orthodox theoretical marxism, particularly on the issue of Marx's theory of crisis, against revisionists such as [[Paul Sweezy]]. Mattick's essay Technology and the Mixed Economy (1966) was a rare articulation of the limitations and social origin of the drive for labour productivity. Mattick drew substantially on Grossman's 1929 study The law of accumulation and the breakdown of capitalism defending its analysis against Sweezy 1942] and other anti-marxists who sought to eradicate the connection between capitalist accumulation and the theory of crises. Mattick argued that despite the appearance of the post-war boom capitalism would continue to retard the development of productive forces and that the limits to capital accumulation would reassert themselves. Until Grossman's work becomes fully available in English, Mattick's Economic Crisis and Crisis Theory remains the most readily available articulation of the necessity of revolutionary theory for today's conditions. The 1970s saw a resurgence of marxist studies which sought to assimilate the theoretical gains which had been lost to working class politics in the middle decades of the twentieth century.

Drawing on these and other forgotten works in the marxist tradition and a renewed study of the methodologically explicit drafts and early writings and correspondence of Marx, a tendency began to emerge which struggled to return theoretically to an authentic "Marx's Marxism" and come to terms with the outstanding problems facing marxist critique of capitalist society in the second half of the twentieth century. Unfortunately the political hiatus caused by the largely unexpected collapse of the Soviet Union, resulted in a widespread fragmentation and demoralisation even amongst those marxist writers who were critical of the stalinist state formations.

The nature of the Soviet Union, the political tenacity and character of stalinism itself, an explanation of the political hold of and contemporary forms of Reformism in the working class and the restatement of the fundamentals of the marxist struggle against the state, and the bourgeois ideological weapons of nationalism, imperialism and the oppression of nations and nationalities, racial and women's oppression and the economic role of the family under capitalism. This tendency has yet to re-articulate Marx's critique of ideological power of the politics of productivity theoretically in challenging the revisionist acceptance of technological mystification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11229">In the history of [[archaeological theory]] the term '''migrationism''' was opposed to the term '''diffusionism''' (or "immobilism")  as a means of distinguishing two approaches to explaining 
the spread of prehistoric [[archaeological culture]]s and innovations in [[artifact (archaeology)|artefact]].
Migrationism explains cultural change in terms of [[human migration]], while diffusionism relies on explanations based on [[trans-cultural diffusion]] of ideas rather than populations (''pots, not people''&lt;ref&gt;Carol Kramer, "Pots and Peoples" in; Louis D. Levine and T. Culyer Young (eds.), Mountains and Lowlands: Essays in the Archaeology of Greater Mesopotamia; Malibu, Undena, 1977; cited in Serge Cleuziou, "Introduction", Objets et symboles: de la culture matérielle à l'espace culturel : actes de la 1re Journée doctorale d'archéologie, Paris, 20 mai 2006, ed. Laurent Dhennequin, Guillaume Gernez and Jessica Giraud, Paris: Sorbonne, 2009, {{ISBN|9782859446222}}, p. 18, n. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Western archaeology the first half of the 20th century relied on the assumption of migration and invasion as driving cultural change.  This was criticized by the [[Processual archaeology|processualist]] in the 1960s and 1970s, leading to a new mainstream which rejected "migrationism" as outdated.&lt;ref&gt;Processual archaeology was further deconstructed by "[[Post-processual archaeology]]" which denied the possibility of ever forming objective conclusions  based on archaeological evidence and denounced "materialist interpretations of the past" as being ethically and politically irresponsible.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the 1990s, there has been renewed interest in "migrationist" scenarios, as archaeologists attempted the archaeological reflexes of migrations known to have occurred historically.
Since the 2000s, the developments in [[archaeogenetics]] have opened a new avenue for investigation, based on the analysis of [[ancient DNA]].

Kristiansen (1989) argued that the reasons for embracing "immobilism" during the [[Cold War era]] was ideological, derived from an emphasis on political solutions displacing military action.&lt;ref&gt;
"The Danish archaeologist Kristiansen (1989) has suggested that the reasons for 
the rising popularity of immobilism lie in post-war  decolonialisation and in the 
development of the welfare state. In the public realm, this led
to an emphasis on political evolution rather than military solutions; in archaeology, this was translated into a belief in autochthonous development rather than 'invasions'."
Härke (1998), citing Hills, C., "The Anglo-Saxon settlement of England.  The state of research in Britain in the late 1980s", in: ''Ausgewählte Probleme europäischer  Landnahmen des Früh- und Hochmittelalters'', ed. M. Müller, (1993), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In British archaeology, the debate between "migrationism" and "immobilism" has notably played out in reference to the example of the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]].

==History==
"[[Diffusionism]]" in its original use in the 19th and early 20th century did not preclude migration or invasion. It was rather the term for assumption of  ''any'' spread of cultural innovation, including by migration or invasion, as opposed "evolutionism", assuming the independent appearance of cultural innovation in a process of [[parallel evolution]], termed "cultural evolutionism".

Opposition to migrationism as argued in the 1970s had an ideological component of [[anti-nationalism]] derived from [[Marxist archaeology]], going back to [[V. Gordon Childe]].
Childe in the [[interwar period]]  combined "evolutionism" and "diffusionism" in arguing an intermediate position that each society developed in its own way, but strongly influenced by the spread of ideas from elsewhere. 
In contrast to Childe's moderate position, which did allow the diffusion of ideas and even moderate migration,  [[Soviet archaeology]] adhered to a form of extreme evolutionism, 
which explained all cultural change due to the class tensions internal to prehistoric societies.&lt;ref&gt;"it was assumed that technologies develop because of internal contradictions within societies. This required that in any explanation of cultural change the principal emphasis had to be on the development of society. The standard series of technological ages was replaced by a unilinear sequence of social stages, each of which was characterised by distinctive productive forces, relations of production, and ideology. [...] Migration was ruled out as a mode of explaining changes in the archaeological record, and strong emphasis was placed on independent parallel development." Trigger, Bruce, ''Gordon Childe: Revolutions in Archaeology'' (1980), p 93&lt;/ref&gt;

"Migrationism" fell from favour in mainstream western archeology in the 1970s. Adams (1978:483f.) described migrationism   an "ad hoc explanation for cultural, linguistic, and racial change in such an extraordinary number of individual cases that to speak of a migrationist school of explanation seems wholly appropriate". Adams (p.&amp;nbsp;484) argued that the predominance of migrationism "down to the middle of the last [19th] century" could be explained because it  "was and is the only explanation for culture change that can comfortably be reconciled with a literal interpretation of the Old Testament", and as such representing an outdated "[[creationist]]" view of prehistory, now to be challenged by "nonscriptural, anticreationist" views.
Adams (p.&amp;nbsp;489) accepts only as "inescapable" migrationist scenarios that concern the [[early human migrations|first peopling]] of a region, such the first settlement of the Americas "by means of one or more migrations across the Bering land bridge"  and  "successive sweeps of Dorset and of Thule peoples across the Canadian Arctic".

While Adams criticized the migration of identifiable "peoples" or "tribes" was deconstructed as a "creationist" legacy based in biblical literalism, Smith (1966) had made a similar argument deconstructing the idea of "nations" or "tribes" as a "primordalistic" misconception based in modern nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony D. Smith, ''The Ethnic Origins of Nations'' (Oxford, 1966) pp. 6ff, coined the term "primordalistic" to separate these thinkers from those who view ethnicity as a situational construct.&lt;/ref&gt;

The support of "diffusionist", i.e. non-migrationist, views has thus been associated with [[anti-nationalism]] and [[progressivism]] since the 1970s. While mainstream western archaeology maintained moderate scenarios of migrationism in spite of such criticism, it did move away from "[[invasionism]]". The mainstream view came to depict prehistoric cultural change as the result of gradual, limited migration of a small population that would consequently become influential in spreading new ideas but would contribute little to the succeeding culture's biological ancestry.
Thus, the mainstream position on the [[Neolithic Revolution]] in Europe as developed (notably by German archaeologist Jens Lüning) since the 1980s, posits that "a small group of immigrants inducted the established inhabitants of Central Europe into sowing and milking" in a process spreading "in swift pace, in a spirit of 'peaceful cooperation'"&lt;ref name="Milk"/&gt;
Migration was generally seen as being a slow process, involving family groups moving into new areas and settling amongst the native population, described as "demic diffusion" or "wave of advance", in which population would be essentially [[sedentism|sedentary]] but expand by the colonisation of new territory by succeeding generations.

The question remained intractable until the arrival of [[archaeogenetics]] since the 1990s. 
The new field's rapid development since the 2000s has resulted in an increasing number of studies 
presenting quantitative estimates on the genetic impact of migrating populations.
In several cases, this has led to a revival of the "invasionist" or "mass migration" scenario (in the case of the [[Neolithic Revolution]] in Europe&lt;ref name="Milk"&gt;
Matthias Schulz,  [http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/neolithic-immigration-how-middle-eastern-milk-drinkers-conquered-europe-a-723310.html Neolithic Immigration: How Middle Eastern Milk Drinkers Conquered Europe], ''[[Spiegel Online]]'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;), or at least suggested that the extent of prehistoric migration had been underestimated (e.g. in the context of [[Indo-European expansion]], it was estimated that the people of the [[Yamnaya culture]] in Eastern Europe contributed to 73% of the ancestry of individuals pertaining to the  [[Corded Ware culture]] in Germany, and to about 
40–54% to the ancestry of modern Central &amp; Northern Europeans.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/science/dna-deciphers-roots-of-modern-europeans.html |title=DNA Deciphers Roots of Modern Europeans |date=June 10, 2015 |first=Karl |last=Zimmer |newspaper=[[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nomads &gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/archaeology/2015/06/nomadic-herders-left-strong-genetic-mark-europeans-and-asians "Nomadic herders left a strong genetic mark on Europeans and Asians"], 10 June 2015, By Ann Gibbons, Science (AAAS)&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Mill Conversion''' or '''mill rehab''' is a form of [[adaptive reuse]] in which a historic [[cotton mill|mill]] or industrial [[factory]] building is restored or rehabilitated into another use, such as [[Apartment|residential housing]], [[Retail|retail shops]], [[office]], or a mix of these non-industrial elements ([[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]]).

==Historical background==
In the [[United States]] the development of industry during 19th and early 20th century resulted in the construction of thousands of mills or factory buildings typically of brick or stone masonry construction across the nation, with a high concentration in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. By 1920, there were hundreds of [[mill towns]] across the region built for the production of textiles and other goods, such as shoes, machinery and other items. However, the Northern textile industry would suffer greatly beginning in the early 1920s, with the failure of many of these companies, and the rise in competition from Southern mills. Other industries would follow, especially during the later part of the 20th century, when [[globalization]] changed the economy, and entire industries began to move overseas to developing nations. Through the 20th century, many mills carried on in a variety of industrial purposes, other than original intended use. Many were used for storage, or other small enterprises. Still, many more remained mostly vacant and underutilized through the middle part of the 20th century, and even today. Many vacant mill buildings have become a target for vandalism, [[arson]] and contribute to [[urban blight]] in many communities.

A similar scenario has also played out in [[Great Britain]] and elsewhere in [[Europe]] during this same timeframe.

==Historic awareness movement==
Beginning in the 1960s, there was a large public outcry throughout the [[United States]] for an increase in [[historic preservation]], to stop the loss of historic structures that began during the 1950s with [[urban renewal]] projects in big cities and small towns across the nation. A similar movement occurred in [[Great Britain]] decades earlier.

One result of this outcry was the establishment of the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1966, by the [[Federal Government]]. Since this time, more than one-million listings have been added to the National Register, on many types of structures and places across the country. While not a certain guarantee that a structure will never be demolished, the National Register provides owners with a tool to seek national and state tax credits, grants and other assistance that may enable the rehabilitation of the building.

Since the 1960s communities across the country have established [[Historic Districts]] and special by-laws in an attempt to preserve and prevent the destruction of properties deemed important to the context of history.

==Mill to museum conversion==
[[Image:Slater Mill close.jpg|thumb|Slater Mill, Pawtucket]]
The first successful textile mill in the [[United States]] was [[Slater Mill]], established by [[Samuel Slater]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]] in 1793. With its significant historic value, the drive to restore Slater Mill into a public museum began during the mid-20th century.

In 1971, the [http://www.brandywinemuseum.org Brandywine River Museum of Art] opened in [[Chadds Ford Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Chadds Ford]], [[Pennsylvania]] in a converted [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era [[Gristmill|grist mill]]. The mill (and an additional 8 1/2 acres) was purchased at auction by the newly formed Brandywine Conservancy. Renovations began in 1970 and the museum opened in 1971. The renovation was done by James R. Grieves Associates, Inc. of Baltimore. Grieves was the only professional consulted who wanted to keep the 19th structure intact.  Other architects recommended tearing it down and starting over. The museum exhibits Wyeth and American art, with galleries devoted to the works of N.C., Andrew, and Jamie Wyeth.

In 1976, [[Lowell Heritage State Park]] was established in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. In 1978, the United States Congress established [[Lowell National Historical Park]] and the Lowell Historic Preservation Commission. The legislation to create the park was sponsored by United States Senator and Lowell native [[Paul Tsongas]]. The restoration gathered momentum in the 1980s, including the renovation of the canals and former mill facilities into museums, as well as the construction of a waterfront walkway.

During the 1980s, with the example of Lowell's National Historic Park coming into fruition, the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] established a series of Heritage State Parks throughout the state to celebrate and preserve the state's valuable historic (mostly industrial) history. [[Lawrence Heritage State Park]], which occupies a former mill [[boardinghouse]] in the city's industrial canal district, is an excellent example.

In 1999, the former Arnold Print Works mills in [[North Adams, Massachusetts]] was converted into the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MassMOCA).

Not all historic mills can be successfully transformed into museums however, only with the few, most significantly historic ones has this been possible.

==Mill to residential conversion==
Since most mills were initially zoned as "industrial" with the emergence of zoning ordinances during the mid- and late 20th century, an early obstacle of many planners and developers in transforming these vacant or underutilized mill spaces into residences was to convince local officials that the usefulness of the mills for continuing industry was limited. Business practices were changing, and the old mill buildings were no longer efficient or practical for industry. Even today, most jurisdictions require some sort of special permit or zoning change in order for the conversions to take place.

One of the earliest known conversions of a historic textile mill into residential apartments is the [[Valley Falls Company]] south mill located in [[Central Falls, Rhode Island]]. This project was completed in 1979, and now includes 133 units of elderly housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brunercott.com/bca2006/library/blackstonefalls/blackfalls.html Bruner/Cott &amp; Associates Portfolio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106050431/http://www.brunercott.com/bca2006/library/blackstonefalls/blackfalls.html |date=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bordercity.jpg|thumb|Border City Mill Apartments, Fall River]]
Other mill conversion projects during the 1980s include the Border City Mill Apartments in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]], situated in a historic 1870's brick cotton mill.

The huge Massachusetts Mills in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] were converted into a 445-unit apartment complex beginning in 1990, while the nearby Market Mills Apartments have 230 units. In recent years, with [[Massachusetts]] historic tax credit program, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060052/http://www.boottmills.com/main.htm Boott Mills] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080709044221/http://www.renaissanceontheriver.com/history.html Lawrence Mills] have been converted into residences also, as part of Lowell's continued revitalization of its historic waterfront area.

Mill conversions have also occurred in other parts of the [[United States]], such as the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090107055522/http://cottonmillcondo.com/outside_home.asp Cotton Mill Condos] in [[New Orleans]], completed in 1997.

In recent years, there has been a trend toward the [[loft]] style [[apartment]] or [[condominium]] unit, with high ceilings, exposed bricks, tall windows, wood floors, and exposed beams or structural elements.

One of the most ambitious mill conversion projects in recent years is the transformation of the huge Wood Mill in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]]. Built in 1906, it was the largest textile mill in the world at the time. The project is known as [http://www.monarchlofts.com Monarch on the Merrimack].

==Mill to mixed-use conversion==
Concurrent with the move to restore former industrial mills into residences, has been the conversion of certain sites into a mix of retail shops, offices and restaurants and other non-industrial uses.  During the 1980s, many of the historic cotton mills in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]] were converted into factory outlet stores, although with minimal physical alteration other than some partitions and carpeting. The factory outlet stores in Fall River were highly successful for many years, but have in recent years declined, a victim of newer "premium outlet" malls opening up in nearby suburban areas such as [[Wrentham, Massachusetts]], and others.

One excellent example of a mill to mixed-use conversion in [[New England]] is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509081248/http://www.clocktowerplace.com/ Clocktower Place], located in the small town of [[Maynard, Massachusetts]]. The huge mill complex was originally the Assabet Manufacturing Company, which grew during the 19th century to be one of the largest textile companies in the state, specializing in woolen goods. It was later acquired by the [[American Woolen Company]], and later, by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], until it finally vacated the location in 2001. Since then, the entire complex has been transformed into an office park. It is now home to many companies in differing markets. Its most famous tenant is perhaps [[Monster.com]].

The largest mill to mixed-use conversion in [[New England]] however, can be found at [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], with the successful renovation and conversion of the [[Amoskeag Manufacturing Company|Amoskeag Millyard]], once the largest single textile company in the world. The Amoskeag Millyard is the centerpiece of Manchester's waterfront, and includes offices, restaurants, a museum, residences and a university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bradysullivan.com Brady Sullivan Properties]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic tax credits==
[[Image:Royal-Riverpoint.jpg|thumb|Royal Mills, West Warwick, Rhode Island, an example of a recent mill conversion enabled by the use of historic tax credits]]
Often, parking, utilities and other infrastructure need to be upgraded as part of the mill conversion process. Many of the old industrial sites contain levels of contamination, which can be very costly for the developers to mitigate.

In recent years, many states have enacted Historic Tax Credit programs in an attempt to enable the rehabilitation of older structures deemed to be "historically significant". Typically, the major criteria for this determination is a listing with the [[National Register of Historic Places]], usually followed by a review by state and local agencies. The development companies typically utilize the tax credits to offset the usually expensive process of renovation and site cleanup.

An example of a Mill conversion utilized by the use of a state historic tax program is the Royal Mills in [[West Warwick, Rhode Island]], redeveloped by [https://web.archive.org/web/20080618074153/http://www.sber.com/home.php SBER] a [[Baltimore]]-based company with a long history of historic preservation projects. This mill had sat vacant for many years, and was in serious threat of being demolished. The site has since successfully been converted into residential apartments, situated on the [[Pawtuxet River]] with a walking trail and bike path nearby.

While recently suspended due to the State's budget crisis, [[Rhode Island]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20080828160912/http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/credits_pdfs/hpitc_pdfs/080415hpitc_emergencyregs.pdf Historic Tax Credit Program] was deemed as one of the most successful in the nation, enabling hundreds of historic structures across the state to be preserved over the past several years since it was enacted.

The benefits historic tax credit programs to state budgets have been often controversial, but there are many indirect economic benefits to local communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projo.com/news/content/historic_tax_credits_02-09-07_7L32HNU.1712e12.html Rhode Island's Historic Tax Credit Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

The property tax value of a restored mill it typically about ten times greater than the existing underutilized mill building, and there is also the added benefit of many construction jobs and other services during the renovation process. The intangible value of having a historic factory building preserved for future generations to enjoy, as well as the benefits to the community are often harder to calculate. The restored mill buildings often become the focal point of the community.

The '''Nimrud ivories''' are a large group of small carved ivory plaques and figures dating from the 9th to the 7th centuries BC that were excavated from the [[Assyria]]n city of [[Nimrud]] (in modern [[Ninawa Governorate|Ninawa]] in [[Iraq]]) during the 19th and 20th centuries. Most are fragments of the original forms; there are over 1,000 significant pieces, and many more very small fragments. 

The ivories mostly originated outside [[Mesopotamia]] and are thought to have been made in the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. They are carved with motifs typical of those regions and were used to decorate a variety of high-status objects, including pieces of furniture, chariots and horse-trappings, weapons, and small portable objects of various kinds.  Many of the ivories would have originally been decorated with gold leaf or semi-precious stones, which were stripped from them at some point before their final burial.  A large group were found in what was apparently a palace storeroom for unused furniture.  Many were found at the bottom of wells, having apparently been dumped there when the city was sacked during the poorly-recorded collapse of the [[Assyrian Empire]] between 616 BC and 599 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/324200 Metropolitan note]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cloisonné furniture plaque with two griffins in a floral landscape MET DP110673.jpg|thumb|[[Cloisonné]] furniture plaque with two griffins in a floral landscape, Phoenician style, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]

Many of the ivories were taken to the [[United Kingdom]] and were deposited in (though not owned by) the [[British Museum]]. In 2011, the Museum acquired most of the British-held ivories through a donation and purchase and is to put a selection on view. It is intended that the remainder will be returned to Iraq. A significant number of ivories were already held by Iraqi institutions but many have been lost or damaged through war and looting.  Other museums around the world have groups of pieces.

==Description==
The ivories comprise plaques decorated in relief with intricate carvings of sphinxes, lions, serpents, people, flowers and geometric motifs, as well as carvings of female heads and female figurines.  They were carved in various locations across the Ancient Near East, including Egypt, modern Syria and Lebanon, with relatively few carved locally.&lt;ref name="artfund"/&gt;  The ivory used to make these objects would originally have been derived from [[Syrian elephant]]s which were endemic in the Middle East in ancient times, but by the 8th century BC the Syrian elephant had been hunted close to extinction, and ivory for later objects would have had to be imported from India,&lt;ref name="frankfort-1970-311"&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfort|1970|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more likely, Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/324200 Metropolitan note]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ivory plaques are thought to have been used to decorate chariots, furniture and horse trappings, and would originally have been covered in gold leaf or ornamented with semi-precious stones such as [[lapis lazuli]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt;  Some pieces still preserve remnants of gold leafing.  Many were already centuries old when put in storage and may have fallen out of fashion by that time. The gold may have been removed from the ivories before they were put in storage,&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; or it may have been taken by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]] when they sacked and razed Nimrud in 612 BC.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;
[[File:Placchetta d'avorio da nimrud, figure alate, VIII-VII secolo ac.jpg|thumb|Plaque]]

Some of the ivories have [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician letters]] engraved on their back, which it is thought may have been used as guides to the assembly of pieces onto the furniture to which the ivories were attached.  The presence of Phoenician letters on the ivories suggests that they were the product of [[Phoenicia]]n craftsmen.&lt;ref name="frankfort-1970-311-312"&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfort|1970|pp=311–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to plaques, many small ivory carvings of female heads have been found at Nimrud, most only one or two inches in height, but a few over 5 inches tall.  Many of these heads wear a flat cap which is very similar to the flat caps depicted on much earlier ivories from the [[Tel Megiddo]] site in modern [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="frankfort-1970-313-314"&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfort|1970|pp=313–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another common carved form found at Nimrud comprises figurines of two naked females joined back to back, which are thought to have been used either as handles for fans or mirrors, or as a decorative element on furniture.&lt;ref name="frankfort-1970-313-314"/&gt;

The plaques show a wide variety of themes, some of which exhibit a pure Assyrian style,&lt;ref name="frankfort-1970-311"/&gt; and some of which show Egyptian influence, with engravings of Egyptian people or gods, and even [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]].  However, the Egyptian themes are often misconstrued, and the hieroglyphs do not form valid names, so they would seem to be debased imitations of Egyptian art.&lt;ref name="frankfort-1970-314-322"&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfort|1970|pp=314–322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A far greater number of ivories were found at Nimrud than at any other Assyrian site, and it is thought that they had been brought to Nimrud as booty or imported as luxury goods from cities on the Mediterranean coast.  Some centuries later it seems that these objects fell out of fashion, and were put into storage.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | last=Kennedy | first =Maev | title=British Museum buys Assyrian treasures cleaned by Agatha Christie | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/07/british-museum-assyrian-treasures-agatha-christie | publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]] | date=7 March 2011 | accessdate=2011-03-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries==

===Layard (1845)===
The first group of ivories was excavated from the site of the palace of [[Shalmaneser III]] (ruled 859–824 BC) at the Assyrian capital of Nimrud. The palace was rediscovered in 1845 by [[Austin Henry Layard]], on the very first day of his excavations; on the second day, he made the first discovery of ivories.&lt;ref name="fant-reddish-2008-113"&gt;{{harvnb|Fant|Reddish|2008|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loftus (1854–1855)===
[[File:Nimrud ivory Egyptians.jpg|330px|right|thumb|Plaque made in Egypt]]
More ivories were found during [[William Kennett Loftus]]'s excavations in 1854–1855. They were found in a group of buildings labelled the "South-East Palace" or "Burnt Palace"; Loftus described the circumstances of the discovery in a letter to the ''Journal of Sacred Literature'' in February 1855:

{{quote|The S.E. Palace at Nimroud has just yielded a large collection of beautiful ivories, relics of a throne or furniture, &amp;c. They have been fitted together by means of rivets, slides, and grooves – a complete Assyrian puzzle, and somewhat dangerous to sit on! Many exhibit traces of gilding and enamel, and were probably broken up for the inlaid gold and jewels with which they were once adorned. There is a decided Egypto-Assyrian character about the whole collection, perfect Egyptian heads being mixed with Assyrian Bulls and [[Assyrian lion|Lion]]s. The heads were very fine indeed. Some of the articles were maces, dagger-handles, or portions of chairs and tables (for we have undoubted evidence of the Assyrians using such.) Figures back to back form a shaft, and support a flower-headed capital. There are also boxes, and a vase – all elaborately carved. The Assyrians were adepts in veneering, the layers being highly ornamented with sacred emblems and lion-hunts. Phoenician inscriptions are found on two of three articles. They were found strewed at the bottom of a chamber among wood ashes. They had escaped the flames, but are blackened from lying among smouldering wood. I have got up a horse-load of objects, and am fitting them together as fast as possible, preparatory to boiling them in gelatine. The whole room is not yet explored, as the earth must first be removed from above. I propose going down to-morrow.&lt;ref&gt;Loftus, W.K. ''The Journal of Sacred Literature'' (ed. J. Kitto), July 1855, p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Mallowan (1949–1963)===
[[File:A supine bull, one of the Nimrud ivories found by Sir Max Mallowan, The Sulaymaniyah Museum, Iraq..JPG|thumb|A supine bull, one of the Nimrud ivories found by Sir Max Mallowan, The Sulaymaniyah Museum, Iraq.]]

Further discoveries were made between 1949 and 1963 by a team from the [[British Institute for the Study of Iraq|British School of Archaeology in Iraq]] led by the archaeologist [[Max Mallowan]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | title=Christie ivories to go on show at British Museum | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12675883 |publisher=[[BBC Online]] | accessdate=2011-03-08 | date=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mallowan found thousands of ivories, many of which were discovered at the bottom of wells into which they had apparently been thrown when the city was sacked, either in the turmoil that followed the death of [[Sargon II]] in 705 BC or when Nineveh fell and was destroyed in 612 BC.&lt;ref name="fant-reddish-2008-113"/&gt;  Mallowan's wife was the famous British crime novelist, [[Agatha Christie]] (1890–1976), who was fascinated with archaeology, and who accompanied her husband on the Nimrud excavations.&lt;ref name="bm-christie"&gt;{{cite web | title=Agatha Christie and archaeology | publisher=[[British Museum]] | url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx | accessdate=2011-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christie helped photograph and preserve many of the ivories found during the excavations, explaining in her autobiography that she cleaned the ivories using a fine [[knitting needle]], an [[Types of nail care tools|orange stick]] and a pot of face cream.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news | title=British Museum buys 3,000-year-old ivory carvings Agatha Christie cleaned with her face cream | publisher=[[Daily Mail]] | date=8 March 2011 | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1364051/Nimrud-Ivories-cleaned-Agatha-Christie-s-face-cream-display-London.html | accessdate=2011-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection of ivories uncovered by Mallowan were divided between Iraq and Britain, where they remained at the British School of Archaeology in Iraq (later to become the British Institute for the Study of Iraq) until 1987.&lt;ref name="artfund"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nimrud Ivories | url=http://www.artfund.org/artwork/10774/nimrud-ivories | publisher=[[Art Fund]] | accessdate=2011-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were then put in storage at the British Museum until 2011, but were not put on display.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Many of the Iraqi-held ivories have been lost or damaged. Following the [[Iraq War]] 2003 the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in [[Baghdad]] was looted, and many of the ivories kept there were damaged or stolen.  Other ivories that were stored in a bank vault in Baghdad were damaged by water when the building was shelled.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

In March 2011, the British Museum purchased one third of the Mallowan ivories (comprising 1,000 complete ivories and 5,000 fragments) from the British Institute for the Study of Iraq for £1.17&amp;nbsp;million, following a public fundraising campaign that raised £750,000 in six months, and with the support of grants from the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]] and the [[Art Fund]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artfund"/&gt;  This is the second most expensive purchase by the British Museum since the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], second only in price to the [[Burney Relief|Queen of the Night]] which cost £1.5&amp;nbsp;million in 2003.&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt;

In addition to the purchase, the British Institute for the Study of Iraq has also donated another third of its collection to the British Museum in recognition of the storage of the collection by the museum over the previous 24 years. It is anticipated that the remaining third of the collection will be returned to Iraq sometime in the future.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artfund"/&gt; A selection of the ivories will be put on display at the British Museum from 14 March 2011.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

===Oates (1957–1963)===
The largest single ivory find was made between 1957–1963 when a British School team led by David Oates discovered a room at the Nimrud palace that was dubbed the "ivory room", which had apparently served as the main storage centre for ivory objects amassed by the Assyrian kings. Subsequent excavations by the Iraqi Department of Antiquities unearthed still more ivories.&lt;ref name="fant-reddish-2008-114"&gt;{{harvnb|Fant|Reddish|2008|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other discoveries===
In recent years excavations by the Iraqi Department of Antiquities have unearthed more ivories.&lt;ref name="fant-reddish-2008-114"/&gt;

[[File:Celler de Sant Cugat lateral.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Parabolic arches in [[Celler de Sant Cugat]]]]
A '''parabolic arch''' is an [[arch]] shaped like a [[parabola]].&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"&gt;Article about parabolic arch by The Free Dictionary: [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/parabolic+arch Parabolic arch | Article about parabolic arch by The Free Dictionary], accessdate: March 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Such arches are used in bridges, [[cathedral]]s, and elsewhere in architecture and engineering.

==Description==

===The mathematics===

While a parabolic arch may resemble a [[catenary arch]], a [[parabolic curve|parabola]] is a [[quadratic function]] while a [[catenary]] is the [[hyperbolic cosine]], cosh(''x''), a sum of two [[exponential function]]s.

===The Line of Thrust, why such arches are used===

Unlike a [[catenary arch]], the parabolic [[arch]] employs the principle that when weight is uniformly applied above, the internal compression (see [[line of thrust]]) resulting from that weight will follow a [[parabolic curve]]. Of all arch types, the parabolic arch produces the most thrust at the base. Also, it can span the widest area. It is commonly used in [[bridge]] design, where long spans are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vgprkYFib4AC&amp;pg=PA744|title=Developments in Mechanics of Structures &amp; Materials|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ebooks.narotama.ac.id-file1&gt;[http://ebooks.narotama.ac.id/files/The%20Design%20of%20Prestressed%20Concrete%20Bridges/Chapter%2017%20The%20Design%20And%20Construction%20Of%20Arches.pdf The Design of Prestressed Concrete Bridges/Chapter 17 The Design And Construction Of Arches]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared to catenary arches===

When an arch carries a uniformly distributed vertical load, the correct shape is a parabola. When an arch carries only its own weight, the best shape is a [[catenary arch|catenary]].&lt;ref name=ebooks.narotama.ac.id-file1/&gt;

A [[hen's egg]] can be fairly well described as two different [[paraboloid]]s connected by part of an [[ellipse]]

'''Peter Frederik Suhm''' (18 October 1728 &amp;ndash; 7 September 1798), was a [[Danish people|Danish]] historian.

==Biography==
Suhm studied at the [[University of Copenhagen]] from 1746 to 1751, and one of his teachers was [[Ludvig Holberg]].&lt;ref&gt;H. F. Rørdam: Artikel „Suhm, Peter Frederik“. In: [http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0561.html Dansk biografisk Lexikon] Band 16. Kopenhagen 1902. p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749 he translated a comedy of [[Plautus]] and a French theatrical piece.&lt;ref&gt;H. F. Rørdam: Artikel „Suhm, Peter Frederik“. In: [http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0562.html Dansk biografisk Lexikon] Band 16. Kopenhagen 1902. p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1751 he traveled to [[Trondheim]] together with the Danish historian [[Gerhard Schøning]], with whom he continued to collaborate over the following years.&lt;ref name="Dansk biografisk Lexikon"/&gt; Together they produced ''Forbedringer til den gamle danske og norske Historie'' (Improvements to the old Danish-Norwegian History) in 1757.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{cite web| last =Larsen| first =Stian Bones| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =GERHARD SCHØNING OG OMVURDERINGEN AV DET NORDLIGE PÅ 1700-TALLET| work =| publisher =Universitetet i Tromsø| date =| url =http://www.hum.uit.no/nordlit/11/12larsen.html| doi =| language =Norwegian| accessdate =11 November 2010| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070921230252/http://www.hum.uit.no/nordlit/11/12larsen.html| archivedate =21 September 2007| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Trondheim he married Karen Angell (1732–1788) 19 April 1752.&lt;ref name="Dansk biografisk Lexikon"&gt;H.

Kopenhagen 1902. p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter and only inheritor of a wealthy Norwegian merchant Lorents Angell who had died the previous year. Karen Angells mother accepted the connection on the condition that they stayed in Trondheim for the remainder of her life. Suhm accepted, and stayed on in Trondheim, with a short interval in Copenhagen in 1755, for the next nine years, where she died and Suhm and his wife moved back to Copenhagen. The inherited wealth allowed Suhm a life devoted to the sciences and his bookcollection.

Schöning and Suhm, together with [[Johan Ernst Gunnerus]], founded the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]] in 1760 under the name ''Det Trondhiemske Selskab'' (the Trondheim Society).&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/dbl/6/0319.html Eintrag] in [[Dansk biografisk leksikon]], p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1761 it published academic papers in a series titled ''Skrifter''. It was the northernmost scientific society in the world.&lt;ref name=uio&gt;{{cite book|last=Collett|first=John Peter|title=Historien om Universitetet i Oslo|publisher= Universitetsforlaget|location= Oslo|year=1999|pages=14–16|isbn=82-00-12937-3|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dknvsjubileum2010.no/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=135 Oversikt over selskapets Skrifter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222225959/http://www.dknvsjubileum2010.no/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=135 |date=2018-02-22 }}

Suhm published  ''Trondhjemske samlinger'' (five volumes) from 1761 to 1765. In 1771 he published ''Udsigt over videnskabernes og de skjønne kunsters tilstand i Danmark og Norge''. ''Udtog af Danmarks, Norges og Holsteins historie'' (1776) was used in the 19th century as a handbook of history. From 1782 to 1793 he published the first seven volumes of his detailed history of Denmark (''Historie af Danmark'').

Suhm was a chairman of the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters|Danish Academy of Sciences]]. In 1779 he became a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

On October 1788 he made second marriage with Christiane Becker (1764–1799), daughter of Johann Gottfried Becker (1723–1790) and Anna Christina Torm (1738–1809).&lt;ref&gt;H. F. Rørdam: Artikel „Suhm, Peter Frederik“. In: [http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0569.html Dansk biografisk Lexikon] Band 16. Kopenhagen 1902. p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suhm was also a book collector. His collection was comprised about 100 000 volumes. In 1775 he opened his library for the public use. In 1796 [[Daniel Gotthilf Moldenhawer|Moldenhawer]] purchased his collection for the [[Royal Danish Library]] on the condition that the payment would continue in the form of an annuity for Suhm and his wife, but both died shortly after the purchase was completed.&lt;ref name = Gigas&gt;E. Gigas, ''[http://runeberg.org/dbl/11/0367.html Daniel Gotthilf Moldenhawer]'' i 1. at the ''[[Dansk biografisk leksikon]]'', p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in the crypt of the [[Christian's Church, Copenhagen|Christian's Church]] in [[Copenhagen]]. [[Suhmsgade]] in Copenhagen is named after him.

==Legacy==
[[Suhmsgade]] in Copenhagen is named after him.

'''Rascians''' ({{lang-la|Rasciani, Natio Rasciana}}) was an [[exonym]] in the early modern period that designated '''[[Serbs]]''' of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], and in a wider perspective other related [[South Slavs|South Slavic ethnic groups]] of the Monarchy, such as the Catholic [[Bunjevci]] and [[Šokci]] (designated "Catholic Rascians"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Glasnik Srpskog istorijsko-kulturnog društva "Njegoš".|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNblAAAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Njegoš|quote=У другој су биле све могуће нације, међу њима и „католички Раци", тј. Буњевци и Шокци.}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The term was derived from the "[[Raška (region)|Raška]]" (Rascia), a medieval Serbian region and exonym of the medieval Serbian state in Western sources. Because of the large concentration of Serbs in the southern Pannonian Plain, this region was called '''Rascia''', today encompassing territories of [[Serbia]] ([[Vojvodina]]), [[Croatia]] ([[Slavonia]], [[Baranya (county)|south Baranya]] and [[Syrmia|west Syrmia]]), [[Hungary]] (north Baranya and [[Bácska|north Bácska]]) and [[Romania]] ([[Banat|east Banat]] and [[Marisus|lower Marisus]]).

The name, primarily used by [[Hungarians]] and [[Germans]], derived from the ''[[pars pro toto]]'' "[[Raška (region)|Raška]]" (Rascia), a [[medieval Serbia]]n region.{{sfn|Kalić|1995}} The territory inhabited primarily by the Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy was called {{lang-la|Rascia}}; {{lang-sr|Raška/Рашка}}; {{lang-hu|Ráczság,{{sfn|Rascia|1996}} Ráczország,&lt;ref name=LMS-205-210&gt;{{cite book|title=Летопис Матице српске|volume=205-210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pc19AAAAMAAJ|year=1901|publisher=У Српској народној задружној штампарији|page=20|quote=... и да je Иза- бела ту у области, Koja ce звала Cpoiija (Ráczország, rácz tartomány), за поглавара поставила 1542 ПетровиКа: Из AuaÄHJeea дела видимо, да je ПетровиК управл&gt;ао банат- ским и сремским Србима, да je био велик ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; rácz tartomány,&lt;ref name=LMS-205-210/&gt;}}; {{lang-de|Ratzenland, Rezenland}}.

==Background==

The defeats at the hand of the Ottoman Empire in the late 14th century forced the Serbs to rely on the neighbouring states, especially Hungary.{{sfn|Ivić|1914|p=5}} After the Ottoman conquest of Serbian territories in 1439, Despot [[Đurađ Branković]] fled to the Kingdom of Hungary where he was given a large territory in southern Pannonia, while his son [[Grgur Branković|Grgur]] ruled Serbia as an Ottoman vassal until his removal in 1441.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Новаковић|first=Стојан|title=Из српске историjе|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YUNAQAAIAAJ|year=1972|publisher=Matica srpska|pp=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Đurađ's daughter [[Katarina Branković|Katarina]] of Celje (1434–56) held Slavonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Serbian Orthodox Church: Its Past and Present|volume=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAUsAQAAMAAJ|year=1992|publisher=Serbian Patriarchy|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having picked the losing side in the Hungarian civil war, the [[Branković dynasty]] were stripped of their estates in Hungary upon [[Matthias Corvinus]]' coronation in 1458. Left on its own, the [[Serbian Despotate]] lost the capital, [[Smederevo]], to the Ottomans in 1459. Serbs migrated to Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Zeta, and in larger numbers to Hungary, where the immigrants were well-received. Many Hungarians left the frontier for the safer interior, leaving the southern Hungarian kingdom almost abandoned. The settlement of Serbs in [[Syrmia]], [[Bačka]], Banat and [[Pomorišje]] strengthened the Hungarian hold of these sparse areas, most exposed to Ottoman expansion. Following the Ottoman conquest, a large part of the Serbian nobility were killed, while what survived crossed into Hungary, bringing their subjects, including many farmer families, with them. King Matthias won over [[Vuk Grgurević]] in 1465 and proclaimed him a duke over Serbs in Syrmia and the surroundings, which intensified Serb migration; showing his military prowess with bands of Serb warriors, Vuk was proclaimed Serbian Despot in 1471 (thereby restoring the title). The Serbian Despot's army participated in the [[Ottoman-Hungarian Wars]], penetrating into Ottoman territory, which saw large numbers of Serbs retreating with the Hungarian army. A letter of King Matthias from 12 January 1483 mentions that 200,000 Serbs had settled the Hungarian kingdom in the last four years.&lt;ref name="Darby1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Clifford Darby|title=Short History of Yugoslavia |url=https://books.google.rs/books?id=_G43AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Short+History+of+Yugoslavia&amp;hl=sr&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|year=1968|publisher=CUP Archive|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despot Vuk and his warriors were greatly rewarded with estates, also including places in Croatia. Also, by this time, the [[Jakšić family]] had become increasingly notable, and held estates stretching over several counties in the kingdom.{{sfn|Ivić|1914|pp=5–17}} The territory of [[Vuk Grgurević]] (1471–85), the Serbian Despot in Hungarian service (as "Despot of the Kingdom of Rascia"), was called "Little Rascia".&lt;ref name="Lazić1894"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sima Lukin Lazić|title=Kratka povjesnica Srba: od postanja Srpstva do danas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H25EAQAAMAAJ|year=1894|publisher=Štamparija Karla Albrehta|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 15th century, the Serbs made up a large percentage of the population on the territory of present-day [[Vojvodina]]. Because of this, many historical sources and maps, which were written and drawn between 15th and 18th centuries, mention the territory under the names of ''Rascia'' (Raška, Serbia) and ''Little Rascia'' (Mala Raška, Little Serbia).

===16th century===
After 1526, many Serbs (called "Rascians") settled in Slavonia.&lt;ref name="Kostić1965-58"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lazo M. Kostić|title=Obim Srba i Hrvata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cK3AAAAIAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Logos|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526–27, [[Jovan Nenad]] ruled a territory of southern Pannonia during the Hungarian throne struggle; After his death (1527), his commander [[Radoslav Čelnik]] ruled [[Syrmia]] as an Ottoman and Habsburg vassal until 1532, when he retreated to Slavonia with the Ottoman conquest.&lt;ref name=LMS-1939-114&gt;{{cite book|title=Летопис Матице српске|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_fLQAAAAMAAJ|year=1939|volume=351|publisher=У Српској народној задружној штампарији|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Syrmian Serbs then settled the Kingdom of Hungary.&lt;ref name=LMS-1939-114/&gt;

A 1542 document describes that "Serbia" stretched from Lipova and [[Timişoara]] to the Danube, while a 1543 document that Timişoara and [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] being located "in the middle of Rascian land" (''in medio Rascianorum'').&lt;ref name=PI.4-8&gt;{{cite book|title=Posebna izdanja|volume=4–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZASAAAAIAAJ|year=1952|publisher=Naučno delo|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the majority language in the region between [[Mureș (river)|Mureș]] and [[Körös]] was indeed Serbian.&lt;ref name=PI.4-8/&gt; Apart from Serbian being the main language of the Banat population, there were 17 Serbian monasteries active in Banat at that time.{{sfn|Rascia|1996|p=2}} The territory of Banat had received a Serbian character and was called "Little Rascia".&lt;ref name="MaletićBožović1989"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mihailo Maletić|author2=Ratko Božović|title=Socijalistička Republika Srbija|volume=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ba8qAAAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=NIRO "Književne novine"|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
In the 17th and early 18th century, the territory of Slavonia was called "Little Rascia", due to its large number of Serbs.&lt;ref name="Kostić1965-58"/&gt; In 17th-century Habsburg usage, the term "Rascian" referred most commonly to the Serbs who lived in Habsburg territory, then more generally to Orthodox Serbs, wherever they lived, and then more generally still to speakers of Serbian or Croatian.&lt;ref name=Malcolm2002-145&gt;Noel Malcolm, Kosovo - A Short History, Pan Books, London, 2002, page 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor's so-called "Invitatorium" in April 1690, for example, was addressed to Arsenije as "Patriarch of the Rascians", but Austrian court style also distinguished between "Catholic Rascians" and "Orthodox Rascians".&lt;ref name=Malcolm2002-145/&gt; In 1695, Emperor Leopold issued a protective diploma for Patriarch Arsenije and the Serb people, whom he called ''"popolum Servianum"'' and ''"Rasciani seu Serviani"''.&lt;ref name="GrujićKrestić1989"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Radoslav M.

===18th century===
 [[File:Old Rascian with son, Engelbrecht.jpg|thumb|"Old Rascian with son", by Martin Engelbrecht (1684–1756).]]
In official Habsburg documents from the 18th century the Serbs of Habsburg Monarchy were mentioned as ''Rasciani'' ("Rascians"), ''Natio Rasciana'' ("Rascian nation"), ''Illyri'' ("Illyrians") and ''Natio Illyrica'' ("Illyrian nation").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Serbski li͡etopis za god. ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lo8VAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA250|year=1867|publisher=Pismeny Kral. Sveučilišta Peštanskog|pages=250–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Kuruc]] War (1703–1711) of [[Francis II Rakoczi]], the territory of present-day Vojvodina was a battlefield between Hungarian rebels and local Serbs who fought on the side of the Habsburg Emperor. Darvas, the prime military commander of the Hungarian rebels, which fought against Serbs in Bačka, wrote: ''We burned all large places of Rascia, on the both banks of the rivers [[Danube]] and [[Tisza|Tisa]]''.

===1801–48===
When the representatives of the Vojvodinian Serbs negotiated with the Hungarian leader [[Lajos Kossuth]] in 1848, they asked him not to call them ''Raci'', because they regard this name insulting, since they had their national and historical [[endonym]] – [[Serbs]].

The initial name of the city of [[Novi Sad]], ''Ratzen Stadt'' (Rascian/Serb City) derived from the name. The [[Tabán]] quarter of [[Budapest]] was also called ''Rácváros'' in the 18th-19th centuries due to its significant Serb population.

Since the 19th century, the term ''Rascians'' is no longer used.

==Religion==
After the [[Great Serb Migration]], the [[Eparchy of Karlovac and Zrinopolje]] was established in 1695, the first metropolitan being Atanasije Ljubojević, the exiled metropolitan of [[Eparchy of Dabar and Bosnia|Dabar and Bosnia]].

The '''Serb-Montenegrin''' community in '''[[Albania]]''' is estimated to number ca. 2,000 to 30,000 people. In the latest census (2011), citizens had the option to declare as "[[Montenegrins]]" (366 did so). The population is concentrated in the region of [[Vraka]]. The community is bilingual and by majority adhere to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], while a minority professes Islam. Most of the community arrived in Albania during the [[King Zog|Zogist]] period and between 1938 and 1948.&lt;ref name="VickersPettifer1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miranda Vickers|author2=James Pettifer|title=Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan Identity|year=1997|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
The community is commonly known as '''Serbs-Montenegrins''' (''Srbi-crnogorci''), "Serbs" (''Srbi'') or "Montenegrins" (''Crnogorci'').
It has also been called the '''Serbo-Montenegrin minority''' (by the [[Council of Europe]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ECRI report on Albania|year=2010|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/Country-by-country/Albania/ALB-CbC-IV-2010-001-ENG.pdf|page=31|format=PDF|website=Coe.int|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''Serbo-Montenegrins'''.&lt;ref name="PalermoSabanadze2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Francesco Palermo|author2=Natalie Sabanadze|title=National Minorities in Inter-State Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWOwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121|date=14 February 2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-474-2942-5|pages=121–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights==
According to the Serbian Ministry of Diaspora in 2009, the most vulnerable minority of Europe were the Serbs in Albania, who since Communist Albania have not had their right to the use of the Serbian language or the religious orientation (Serbian Orthodox). During the rule of [[Enver Hoxha]], they were forced to change names but have not been able to reclaim them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International Radio Serbia |url=http://glassrbije.org/E/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8165&amp;Itemid=26 |title=International Radio Serbia &amp;#124; |publisher=Glassrbije.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=February 2013}}

==Economy==
The community lives largely on trade with Montenegro.&lt;ref name="Soto2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hermine de Soto|title=Poverty in Albania: A Qualitative Assessment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbrPFI_tHUsC&amp;pg=PA91|date=1 January 2002|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=978-0-8213-5109-3|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics ==
&lt;!--[[File:Albania minorities.png|thumb|Minorities of Albania, Serbs and Montegrins in green]]--&gt;

In the late 19th and 20th century, of the 600-700 people of the Orthodox faith, some 500-600 were Serbo-Montenegrins living in the city of Shkodër.&lt;ref name="Clayer65"/&gt; The area of Vraka had a population of 600-700 Orthodox Slavophones.&lt;ref name="Clayer65"/&gt;

During the first World War occupying Austro-Hungarian forces conducted a census (1916-1918) of parts of Albania they held.&lt;ref name="Steinke17"/&gt; Of the area corresponding to the contemporary wider Shkodër region, settlements that listed Slavophone populations with them had the following ethnic and religious demographics:&lt;ref name="Steinke17"/&gt;

*Koplik (12 settlements counted as one) - 199 households, 1429 people: 1427 Albanians, 2 Serbo-Croats; 2 Orthodox, 1427 Muslims.&lt;ref name="Steinke17"/&gt;
*Buza e Ujit (with the settlements Flaka, Jubica, Kalldrun, Kamica, Stërbica counted as part of the village) - 117 households, 755 people: 677 Albanians, 78 Serbo-Croats; 167 Catholics, 86 Orthodox, 502 Muslims.&lt;ref name="Steinke17"/&gt;
*Boriçi (Boriçi i Ri and Boriçi i Vjetër counted as one settlement) - 61 households, 482 people: 482 Albanians; 3 Catholics, 479 Orthodox.&lt;ref name="Steinke17"/&gt;
*Gril - 28 households, 205 people: 1 Albanian, 204 Serbo-Croats; 1 Catholic, 204 Orthodox.&lt;ref name="Steinke17"/&gt; 
*Rrash-Kullaj - 10 households, 122 people: 122 Albanians; 122 Orthodox.&lt;ref name="Steinke17"/&gt;
*Omaraj - 25 households, 153 people: 5 Albanians, 148 Serbo-Croats; 4 Catholics, 148 Orthodox, 1 Muslim.&lt;ref name="Steinke17"/&gt;
*Rrashi - 9 households, 102 people: 102 Albanians; 83 Orthodox, 19 Muslims.&lt;ref name="Steinke17"/&gt;
*Shtoji - 35 households, 166 people: 166 Serbo-Croats; 7 Catholics, 159 Muslims.&lt;ref name="Steinke17"/&gt;
*Taraboshi - 19 households, 197 people (including Romani): 19 Albanians, 24 Serbo-Croats; 2 Catholics, 7 Orthodox, 188 Muslims.&lt;ref name="Steinke17"/&gt;
*Sukat e Vezirit - 20 households, 164 people, 161 Albanians, 3 Serbo-Croats; 6 Catholics, 2 Orthodox, 155 Muslims.&lt;ref name="Steinke17"/&gt;

Linguists Klaus Steinke and Xhelal Ylli consider the overall census results to be first instance of reliable information on the number of households and inhabitants as well as the ethnic and religious composition of these places.&lt;ref name="Steinke17"/&gt; Both linguists however note that the data for Boriç and Rrash-Kullaj are somewhat unclear as the inhabitants are referred to there as both Albanians and Orthodox.&lt;ref name="Steinke17"&gt;{{harvnb|Steinke|Ylli|2013|pp=17}} "Die ersten verlasslichen Angaben zur Häuser- und Einwohnerzahl sowie zur ethnischen und religiösen Zusammensetzung der Orte macht SEINER (1922: 29, 32).

According to the 1928 population census, there were ca. 65,000 Serbs and Montenegrins in Albania, forming around 8% of Albania's total population and the largest of its minorities.&lt;ref name="Ortakovski1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vladimir Ortakovski|title=Malcinstvata na Balkanot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgMXAQAAIAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Štip|page=191|quote=Sixtу-five thousand of them were Serbs and Montenegrins (7.83%) [...] The Montenegrin and Serbian minority lived in Skadar (Sсutari) and the surrounding villages, in the Vraka region, and in Ljezh and Tirana.

Sixty-five thousand of them were Serbs"}}

In the Albanian census of 1989, there was no accurate data about the minority population of Vraka.&lt;ref name="Genov25"/&gt; The scholar Slobodan Šćepanović for 1991 cited demographics of the Vraka area. Omaraj had 79 households, 67 were Orthodox Montenegrin and 11 Albanian; Gril 85 households, 76 Orthodox Montenegrin and 9 Albanian; Boriç i Vogël 75 households, 67 Orthodox Montenegrin and 8 Albanian; Boriç i Madh had 112 families, 86 Muslim Podgoriçani, 6 Orthodox Montenegrin and 20 Albanian families.&lt;ref name="Steinke19"/&gt; The official statistics of the Albanian government (early 1990s) placed the Montenegrin community at 100, as some Albanian government officials stated that those numbers were accurate due to 700 of them leaving Albania during the democratisation process.&lt;ref name="VancePaik713"/&gt; The Association of Montenegrins (AM), a social-cultural organisation founded in Vraka claimed some 1,000 members that represented the interests of a community of 2,500 people located in Shkodër and the surrounding area.&lt;ref name="VancePaik713"/&gt; AM during that time urged the Albanian government to recognise the Montenegrin and Serb communities in Albania and allow certain linguistic, education, cultural and other rights.&lt;ref name="VancePaik713"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vance|first1=Charles|last2=Paik|first2=Yongsun|title=Managing a Global Workforce: Challenges and Opportunities in International Human Resource Management|year=2006|publisher=M.E.

Although the Montenegrins were not recognized by the Albanian authorities as a distinct national minority, the Association claimed to have over 1,000 members representing the interests of a 2,500-strong minority residing mainly in the around Shkodër. The AM challenged the official statistics issued by Tirana in the early 1990s, in which the number of Montenegrins and Serbs was placed at only 100. Some Albanian officials contended that several hundred Slavs had left the country since the onset of the democratic changes, including both Serbs and Montenegrins, that the numbers were accurate. Members of the Association advocated promoting the culture and customs of Montenegrins and urged the recognition of Montenegrin and Serbian minorities in Albania and the return of original Slavic names to members of these minorities. The AM planned to reopen elementary schools in the mother language and to form a Montenegrin-Serbian club.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 the Helsinki Committee for Human rights in Albania conducted surveys of the Shkoder region and estimated that there were some 1800-2000 Serbian-speakers in the area.&lt;ref name="Steinke19"&gt;{{harvnb|Steinke|Ylli|2013|p=19}} "Ohne genaue Quellenangabe bringt ŠĆEPANOVIĆ (1991: 716-717) folgende ,,aktuelle" Zahlen: Omara 79 Haushalte, davon 68 crnogorski, 11 albanische; Grilj 85 Haushalte, davon 76 crnogorski, 9 albanische; Stari (Mali) Borić 75 Haushalte, davon 67 crnogorski, 8 albanische, Veliki (Mladi) Borić 112 Familien, davon 86 podgoričanski, 6 crnogorski und 20 albanische Familien.

===Early modern===

Montenegrins and Serbs began migrating to Vraka in the late 17th century. From confirmed documents, one of the first families to inhabit the area of Vraka was in 1705 were the Đurčevići from the village of [[Momče]] in [[Kuči]]. A certain Jerko Đurčević was the only one from his clan in Vraka to convert to [[Islam]]. His descendants later became known as the Jerkovići, who are found in the village of Štoj, near [[Ulcinj]].

===Modern===
In 1828, a Serbian school was opened in Shkodra, which [[Nikola Musulin]] attended.

[[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] was not certain "how far there are Serbs in Albania and Macedonia".{{sfn|Krestić|2004|p=163}}

During the [[Montenegrin–Ottoman War (1876–78)]], the Montenegrin army managed to capture certain areas and settlements along the border, and incorporated them into the state such as the town of [[Podgorica]] that had a significant Slavic Muslim population.&lt;ref name="Roberts22"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Elizabeth|title=Realm of the Black Mountain: a history of Montenegro|year=2005|location=London|publisher=Cornell University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Realm_of_the_Black_Mountain.html?id=2VsL4njRMsUC&amp;redir_esc=y|isbn=9780801446016|ref=harv}} p. 22. "Meanwhile Austria-Hungary’s occupation of Bosnia-Hercegovina, which had been conceded at the congress, acted as a block to Montenegrins territorial ambitions in Hercegovina, whose Orthodox Slav inhabitants were culturally close to the Montenegrins. Instead Montenegro was able to expand only to the south and east into lands populated largely by Albanians – both Muslims and Catholics – and Slav Muslims.... The areas to the south and east of Podgorica were inhabited by Albanians from the predominantly Catholic tribes, while further to the east there were also concentrations of Slav Muslims. Podgorica itself had long been an Ottoman trading centre with a partly Turkish, but largely Slav Muslim and Albanian population. To incorporate such a population was to dilute the number of Montenegrins, whose first loyalties lay with the Montenegrin state and Petrović dynasty, not that this was seen as sufficient reason for the Montenegrins to desist from seeking to obtain further territory."&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim population of Podgorica fled&lt;ref name="Blumi254"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blumi|first=Isa|title=Contesting the edges of the Ottoman Empire: Rethinking ethnic and sectarian boundaries in the Malësore, 1878–1912|jstor=3879619|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=35|issue=2|year=2003|pages=254|ref=harv}} p. 254. footnote 38.

'''Sir Fitzroy Hew Royle Maclean, 1st Baronet''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=true|size=100%|KT|CBE}} (11 March 1911 – 15 June 1996) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] soldier, writer and politician. He was a [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist]] [[Member of Parliament]] from 1941 to 1974 and was one of only two men who during the [[World War II|Second World War]] enlisted in the [[British Army]] as a private and rose to the rank of [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|brigadier]], the other being future fellow Conservative MP [[Enoch Powell]].

Maclean wrote several books, including ''[[Eastern Approaches]]'', in which he recounted three extraordinary series of adventures: travelling, often incognito, in Soviet [[Central Asia]]; fighting in the [[Western Desert Campaign]], where he specialised in [[commando]] raids behind enemy lines; and living rough with [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] and his [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. It has been widely speculated that [[Ian Fleming]] used Maclean as one of his [[inspirations for James Bond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyonandturnbull.com/content/show_news.asp?id=86|title=Sir Fitzroy '007' Maclean's James Bond books sell for £26,000 - Lyon &amp; Turnbull|publisher=Lyonandturnbull.com|date=3 September 2008|accessdate=8 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007135642/http://www.lyonandturnbull.com/content/show_news.asp?id=86|archivedate=7 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Maclean was born in [[Cairo, Egypt|Cairo]] to Major Charles Wilberforce Maclean [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|QOCH]] (1875-19??), a member of the Scottish landed gentry serving in Egypt with the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McLynn|first1=Frank|title=Sir Fitzroy Maclean Bt: Obituary|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-fitzroy-maclean-bt-obituary-1337837.html|accessdate=22 December 2015|publisher=The Independent|date=18 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records-in-birth-marriage-death-and-parish-records/and_births-and-baptisms?firstname=gladys%20frances%20elaine&amp;firstname_variants=true&amp;lastname=royle Frances Elaine Gladys Royle] (12 June 1882 – 1954), the only daughter of George Royle, a Royal Navy officer, and Fannie Jane Langueville. The couple wed on [http://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=gbprs%2fm%2f492135891%2f2 12 July 1905 at St George's Parish, Hanover Square, Middlesex, London].

==Heritage and education==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
He was descended from the Macleans of Ardgour, a [[Sept]] of the [[Clan Maclean]], whose chiefs have as their historic seat [[Duart Castle]] on the [[Isle of Mull]] in the Inner Hebrides. He was brought up in Italy and educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], where he read Classics and History. He then studied in Germany before joining [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|the Diplomatic Service]] in 1933.

==In the Soviet Union==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
{{See also|Eastern Approaches}}
In 1934 Fitzroy Maclean was posted to the British Embassy in [[Paris]]. Bored with the pleasant but undemanding routine, he requested a posting to [[Moscow]] in 1937. The two and a half years he spent in the [[Soviet Union]] formed the first third of his best known book, the autobiographical ''[[Eastern Approaches]]''.

Maclean was in Moscow until late 1939, and so was present during the [[Great Purge|great Stalinist purges]], observing the fates of [[Bukharin]] and other Russian revolutionaries. Although he was stationed in the capital, Maclean travelled extensively, primarily by train, into remote regions of the USSR which were off limits to foreigners, and was shadowed by the [[NKVD]] as he did so.

==World War II==
{{See also|Eastern Approaches|World War II in Yugoslavia}}
When war broke out in 1939 Maclean was prevented from joining the military because of his position as a diplomat. He was 2nd Secretary in the Foreign Office. Therefore, he resigned from the Diplomatic Service "to go into politics". After tendering his resignation he immediately took a taxi to the nearest recruiting office and enlisted as a Private in the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]]. He was soon promoted to [[lance corporal]] and was commissioned in 1941. In that year he became the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for [[Lancaster (UK Parliament constituency)|Lancaster]].

In [[North Africa]] in 1942, he distinguished himself in the early actions of the newly formed [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), where, with [[Ralph A. Bagnold]], he developed ways of driving vehicles over the [[Libya]]n sand "seas". Maclean was a brilliant practitioner in the [[T. E. Lawrence]] brand of fighting, and he reported directly to [[Winston Churchill]] in [[Cairo]]. A letter of introduction from [[David Stirling]] said of him at the end of this period: "He has done well on our raids. Don't be taken in by his rather pompous manner or his slow way of speaking - he is OK."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ranfurly, Hermione]], ''[[To War with Whitaker. The wartime diaries of the Countess of Ranfurly]]'' 1939-1945. p. 159. Mandarin Paperbacks 1995, {{ISBN|07493 1954 2}}. First published 1994, William Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persia and Iraq===
Later that year he transferred to the [[Middle East]] as part of the [[Persia and Iraq Command]]. He was "allotted a platoon of Seaforth Highlanders and instructed to kidnap" General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]], the commander of the [[Military of Iran|Persian forces]] in the [[Isfahan]] area.&lt;ref&gt;Ranfurly, Hermione, ''To War with Whitaker. The wartime diaries of the Countess of Ranfurly 1939-1945''. p. 160. Mandarin Paperbacks 1995, {{ISBN|07493 1954 2}}. First published 1994, William Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Maclean captured him and smuggled him out by plane to internment in Palestine. This incident soon led [[Hitler]]'s government to withdraw support from its network in Persia.

===Yugoslavia===
{{main|World War II in Yugoslavia}}
[[File:Yugoslav-leader-marsal-tito-talking-with-itzroy-maclean.jpg|thumb|200px|Yugoslav Leader Marshal Tito Talking with Fitzroy Maclean]]

Churchill chose him to lead a [[Maclean Mission (Macmis)|liaison mission (Macmis)]] to central [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in 1943. [[Josip Broz Tito]] and his Partisans were emerging as a major obstacle to German control of the [[Balkans]]. Little was known at the time about Tito: some suspected this was an acronym for a committee or that he might in fact be a young woman. Maclean got to know Tito well, and later produced two biographies of him. Maclean's relationship with Tito's [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] was not always easy, partly because they were [[Communism|Communist]], while he came from an [[upper class]] Scottish background, and had witnessed [[Stalinism]] in action (see above).

As Churchill personally told him, Maclean's mission was not to concern himself with how Yugoslavia was to be run after the war, but "simply to find out who was killing the most Germans and suggest means by which we could help them to kill more."&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, F: ''[[Eastern Approaches]]'', p. 287. Jonathan Cape; Thirteenth Impression edition (1951)&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Yugoslavia and the Allies]].)

His biography of Tito reveals the admiration he held for the Yugoslav leader and the Yugoslav Communist-led anti-fascist struggle. He developed a great affection for Yugoslavia and its people and was later given permission to buy a house on the [[Dalmatia]]n island of [[Korčula (island)|Korčula, Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article413995.ece Obituary of Veronica Lady Maclean], timesonline.co.uk, 19 January 2005; accessed 10 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36679 |date=31 August 1944 |page=4043 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; he received the [[Order of Kutuzov]] ([[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]]) &lt;ref&gt;Maclean, Eastern Approaches (Pan paperback ed.) p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; (which impressed the Soviet troops in [[Belgrade]]), and after the war the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de Guerre]] ([[France]]), and [[Orders, decorations and medals of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Order of the Partisan Star]] ([[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]). He reached the rank of [[Brigadier]] during the war, and was promoted to [[Major General]] in 1947.

==Later life==
[[File:After Dark Bloody Bosnia 7 August 1993.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Appearing (top) on television discussion programme ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' [[After_Dark_(TV_series)#.22Bloody_Bosnia.22|"Bloody Bosnia"]] in 1993]]
Maclean was elected as [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Lancaster (UK Parliament constituency)|Lancaster]] in the [[Lancaster by-election, 1941|1941 by-election]]. He was re-elected from Lancaster in 1945, 1950, 1951, and 1955. He served briefly as a junior minister at the [[War Office]] from 1954-57.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} [[Harold Macmillan]] regretted losing him, "but he is really so hopeless in the House that he is a passenger in office ... a great pity, since he is so able."&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Diaries, 1950-57'', p.&amp;nbsp;615&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 general election]] he switched constituencies to [[Bute and Northern Ayrshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Bute and North Ayrshire]], where he was elected as a [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist]] (then the Scottish label for Conservatives).
He was re-elected as a Unionist in 1964, and as a Conservative in 1966 and 1970. He retired at the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]]. In his last two years, he was appointed as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]] and [[Western European Union]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Marriage==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
He married [[Veronica Maclean|Veronica Nell Fraser-Phipps]] (1920–2005), a [[Roman Catholic]], in 1946. She was the daughter of the [[Simon Fraser, 14th Lord Lovat|16th Lord Lovat]] and widow of naval hero Lt. Alan Phipps, who was [[Battle of Leros|killed ashore at Leros]] in 1943. Sir Fitzroy and Lady Maclean had two sons: Charles Edward (born 1946) and Alexander James Simon Aeneas ("Jamie"; born 1949), who were brought up in their mother's faith.&lt;ref name="Peerage"&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p5660.htm#i56597 Sir FitzRoy Hew Maclean of Dunconnel, 1st Bt.], The Peerage&lt;/ref&gt; Charles is an author, well known for dark thrillers, including the cult classic ''The Watcher''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/14/books/books-of-the-times-229216.html|title=BOOKS OF THE TIMES|last=Lehmann-haupt|first=Christopher|date=1983-02-14|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamie became an art dealer and founded the ''[[Erotic Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|title=Sometimes I shock myself|date= 23 Nov 2001| first=David | last=Thomas|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4726755/Sometimes-I-shock-myself.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maclean was also stepfather to his wife's children from her first marriage, Susan Rose "Sukie" Phipps (born 1941) and [[Jeremy Phipps|Jeremy Julian Phipps]] (born 1942), who were not brought up Catholic. Sukie married Richard St. Clair de la Mare, grandson of poet [[Walter de la Mare]] in 1959, then writer [[Derek Marlowe]] in 1968, and finally Captain Nicolas Paravicini in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p5661.htm#i56602 Susan Rose Phipps], The Peerage&lt;/ref&gt; She had five children, and is stepmother to [[autistic savant]] [[Derek Paravicini]]. Jeremy became a Major General in the Army, having served in the [[Special Air Service|SAS]].

==Honours==
Sir Fitzroy was honoured with the [[baronet]]cy of Maclean of [[Strachur]] and Glensluain in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=41149 |date=13 August 1957 |page=4781}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made the [[Hereditary Keepers of Palaces and Castles|15th Hereditary Keeper and Captain of Dunconnel Castle]] in 1981 and was made a knight of the [[Order of the Thistle|Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=53499|date=30 November 1993|page=19088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retirement Maclean wrote extensively. His wide range of subjects included: [[History of Scotland|Scottish history]], biographies (including [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] and [[Guy Burgess|Burgess]]), a Russian trilogy and assorted works of fiction. He also contributed to other books, for example writing the foreword to a 1984 biography of [[Joseph Wolff]], the so-called "Eccentric Missionary" in whose footsteps he had travelled to [[Bukhara]] almost half a century before.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Hugh Evan, ''Sublime vagabond: the life of Joseph Wolff - missionary extraordinary'', foreword by Sir Fitzroy Maclean Bart, Worthing: Churchman, 1984; {{ISBN|1-85093-002-3}} &lt;!-- page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Maclean and his wife managed a hotel at [[Strachur]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hotel-keeping in the Highlands'', The Countryman, Autumn 1977, pp 22-27&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1964 he commissioned his wartime friend, fellow commando and yacht designer Alfred Mylne II, to build the motor yacht ''Judi of Bute'' for use around the West Coast of Scotland. Maclean was a patron of [[Strachur and District Shinty Club]]. He collected an extensive library, including a full set of early editions of [[James Bond]] novels, which sold in September 2008 for £26,000.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon &amp; Turnbull website, Edinburgh/London.

In the late 1960s, Maclean bought the Palazzo Boschi villa on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] [[Korčula|island of Korčula]] (present-day Croatia),&lt;ref name=Telegraph-Lady-Maclean&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1480940/Veronica-Lady-Maclean-of-Dunconnel.html|title=Veronica Lady Maclean of Dunconnel|date=12 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he spent a good part of each year.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-fitzroy-maclean-bt-obituary-1337837.html|title=Sir Fitzroy Maclean Bt|date=19 June 1996|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|quote=Born in 1911 in Egypt, the son of an officer in the Cameron Highlanders ...

Yugoslav legislation at the time barred foreigners from buying real-estate property, but Tito intervened to allow Maclean to do so. The [[Korčula (town)|town of Korčula]] was declared a [[City-state|free city]], and the Macleans were declared its citizens. As soon as the purchase was registered with city authorities, the free city status was revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Nacional (weekly)]]|url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/13108/skotska-lady-koja-obozava-tita-i-mesica|language=Croatian|title=Škotska lady koja obožava Tita i Mesića|trans-title=Scottish Lady who Adores Tito and Mesić|first=Milivoj|last=Đilas|issue=342|date=5 June 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191004/http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/13108/skotska-lady-koja-obozava-tita-i-mesica|archivedate=2 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, during the [[Croatian War of Independence]], Maclean and his wife delivered medical supplies to the island of Korčula, with a substantial contribution from the people of [[Rothesay, Bute|Rothesay]] and [[Isle of Bute|Bute]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph-Lady-Maclean/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/66/a9018966.shtml|title=British Forces Involvement in Yugoslavia 1943-45|publisher=BBC Scotland|date=31 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen White, SJ''' (1575&amp;ndash;1646) was a [[Jesuit]] author and [[antiquarian]] who wrote about the early Irish saints.
 
==Life==
Stephen White was born in [[Clonmel]], Ireland, in 1575.&lt;ref name=ricorso&gt;[http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/w/White_S/life.htm "Stephen White", Ricorso]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1592, [[Trinity College, Dublin]] was founded, and S. White (in all probability Stephen White) was one of the few students named in the charter. Unwilling to take the [[Oath of Supremacy]], he left his native land and entered the Irish College in [[Salamanca]], Spain, where in 1596 he joined the [[Society of Jesus]], and taught from 1602 to 1606.&lt;ref name=Flaherty&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15612c.htm Flaherty, Matthew. "Stephen White." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 24 Jul. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1606 to 1609 White was professor of Scholastic Philosophy at [[Ingolstadt]].&lt;ref name=ricorso/&gt; He also held the chair of Theology at Dilingen. He applied himself to the study of history and was generally reputed to be one of the most learned men of his time in Europe. [[Archbishop Ussher]] called him a man profoundly versed in the ancient records, not of Ireland alone, but of other countries.&lt;ref name=state&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WpRDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Stephen+White+(Jesuit)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vRtpm0c5rh&amp;sig=fBHOKTZzxndOvSXXZM0mKq7Gs9w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAjgoahUKEwjyj5qTmvTGAhUMcj4KHWbkCsw#v=onepage&amp;q=Stephen%20White%20(Jesuit)&amp;f=false Corcoran, T., ''State Policy in Irish Education, A.D. 1536 to 1816'', Fallon Bros., 1916]&lt;/ref&gt; His chief interest was in Irish history. To him is due the honour of fixing the historic label "[[Scotia]]" to Ireland.&lt;ref name=Flaherty/&gt; He called attention to the treasures of Irish literature preserved in the monasteries and libraries of Germany, and generously supplied many noted scholars, such as Ussher and John Colgan, with accurate copies of Irish manuscripts accompanied by critical emendations and commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/StephenWhiteDD.php Webb, Alfred. "Stephen White D.D.", ''A Compendium of Irish Biography'', Dublin, M.H. Gill &amp; son, 1878]&lt;/ref&gt; It was White who found a copy of [[Adamnan]]’s ''Vita Sancti Columbae'' ("Life of St. Columba") in a chest in Schaffhausen.&lt;ref name=ricorso/&gt;

His biographical notices of early Irish saints were utilized in the "Acta SS", and the [[Bollandist]]s acknowledged the assistance which he gave to Father [[Heribert Rosweyde]]. What gave him the bent towards early Irish history seems to have been the publication in Frankfurt by [[William Camden]] of two works by [[Gerald of Wales]], which he felt libelled Ireland and its people. In refutation he wrote his best-known work ''Apologia pro Hibernia adversus Cambri calumnias'', probably written some time before 1615.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/apologiaprohibe00kellgoog#page/n9/mode/2up White, Stephen. ''Apologia pro Hibernia adversus Cambri calumnias'', (preface), (Matthew Kelly, ed.), Dublin, John O'Daly, 1849]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1623 to 1627 he was in the Province of Champagne, and from 1627 to 1629 at the college of Metz.&lt;ref name=ucc&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/en/cnls/resources/findinglist/stephenwhite/ "Stephen White", Centre for Neo-Latin Studies, University College Cork]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1629 there was a Jesuit college established in Dublin under the patronage of Lady Elizabeth Kildare, widow of [[Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Kildare]]. Jane Ohlmeyer believes Father White was probably the Superior.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zHZYbeg-zeoC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=Stephen+White+(Jesuit)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5NvgzbAY_j&amp;sig=nux58rSdL-xPRTcBFU2SZdP1Xa0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBjgeahUKEwi4v6CSlfTGAhXDOD4KHVcNADo#v=onepage&amp;q=Stephen%20White%20(Jesuit)&amp;f=false Ohlmeyer, Jane. ''Making Ireland English'', Yale University Press, 2012] {{ISBN|9780300118346}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college, however, was after a short time suppressed by the Government, and the property was confiscated and handed over to Trinity College. For some years he laboured in his native [[Diocese]] of [[Waterford]] and [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]], mainly engaged in teaching [[catechism]] to children. In 1645 he was Superior of the Jesuit College in Galway where he died.&lt;ref name=Flaherty/&gt;

'''Success Talks''' is an organisation that creates interviews with successful individuals from across the world with a focus on digital media and mobile phone applications to promote key messages which challenges current stereotypes about success. The majority of the content can be found on its [[YouTube]] channel which was started in December 2012. Other interviews can also be found on its [[Facebook]] page and mobile phone [[Application software|app]]. Its channel has gained thousands of views as well as a good following on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. Success Talks have diversified into creating events and have worked with organisations such as [[PwC]], [[Linklaters]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] and [[Teach First]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Sahlu | first = Mirchaye | title = UK entrepreneur uses tech for success | url = http://www.euromight.com/article/successtalks | website = euromight.com | publisher = Euromight }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept arose when founder Dennis Owusu-Sem was having a conversation with a colleague about successful black individuals who were not in the fields of music, sport or entertainment. From this he decided to find as many people as he could interview to answer this and many other questions around success. Success Talks have also been quoted in publications such as the [[Financial Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Whitehead | first = Peter | title = Senior professionals face ‘loss of identity’ | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c7498548-1adb-11e3-a605-00144feab7de.html | work = [[Financial Times]] | subscription = yes | date = 18 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interviews==
Success Talks have amassed over 40 interviews which have been released on [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], Podcasts and its own [[Application software|app]]. Below are some of individuals currently on the series:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7220">The '''Tenrikyo creation narrative''' is the [[creation myth]] of the [[Tenrikyo]] [[religion]]. The narrative was conveyed by the foundress [[Nakayama Miki]] in writing through the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'' and orally to her early followers. After compiling the scriptures and the manuscripts left by early followers, [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]] formalized and published the narrative in chapter three of ''[[The Doctrine of Tenrikyo]]'', titled "Truth of Origin" (元の理 ''moto no ri'').

==Synopsis==
The world began as a muddy ocean, which [[God in Tenrikyo|God]] found tasteless. God decided to create humans in order to see them live the [[Joyous Life]]. Looking through the muddy waters, God found a fish and a serpent which could serve as models of husband and wife respectively. After God convened the couple and received consent from both of them, God promised the couple that in a number of years, they would be returned to the place of original conception and be adored by humanity.{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1993|p=20}}

God convened several other animals from various directions, such as an orc from the northwest. God received their consent, tasted them to determine their natures, and bestowed each of them with a sacred name and a particular function in the human body and in the world. For example, the orc was given the name ''Tsukiyomi-no-Mikoto'' and the function of the male organ and support. After all of animals and their respective names and functions were settled, God consumed the rest of the loaches in the muddy ocean and made them the seeds of humans. Then God inserted the seeds into the body of ''Izanami-no-Mikoto,'' the model of woman, over three days. After three years and three months, ''Izanami-no-Mikoto'' gave birth to as many children as there were seeds.{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1993|pp=20–2}}

The first set of children were born half an inch tall and grew to three inches before dying to be reborn, and the second set of children were born the same height and grew to three and a half inches before dying to be reborn. The third set grew to four inches, and ''Izanami-no-Mikoto'', believing that in time the children would grow to five feet, died contentedly. The children, yearning for their mother, died to be reborn.{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1993|p=22}}

Then, humans were reborn as various animals such as worms and birds. Then all died except for a she-monkey, who gave birth to ten humans at a time. As the humans grew taller, the number of humans conceived at a time was reduced to two and then to one, while the tides, the earth, the sun and moon gradually took shape. Finally, humans were taught for six thousand years in wisdom and three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine years in letters.{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1993|p=23}}

==Composition==
The creation narrative first appeared in writing in 1874, when Nakayama Miki composed Part III of the ''Ofudesaki''. The narrative was described in more detail in Part VI (verses 29–51) and continued to be explained in fragments in the parts thereafter.{{sfn|Matsumura|1998|p=363}}

However, Miki also conveyed the narrative as part of talks she would deliver to her disciples regarding her teachings. She had her disciples write down what they remembered of her talks and submit them to her for her approval. In the end she never approved any of the manuscripts, so her followers did not regard them as [[Biblical canon|canonical]] in the same way as the scriptures – namely the ''Ofudesaki'', ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'', and ''[[Osashizu]]''. The manuscripts that have survived are collectively referred to as ''kōki'' (こふき).{{sfn|Matsumura|1998|pp=360–2}} 

The precise meaning of the term ''kōki'' is ambiguous and followers have interpreted the term using various ''[[kanji]]''. Early followers commonly referred to the manuscripts as "ancient records of the muddy waters" (泥海古記 ''doroumi kōki''),{{sfn|Matsumura|1998|p=363}} though there were other contemporaneous interpretations such as "later record" (後記), "radiant story" (光輝), and "meritorious record" (功記).{{sfn|Nakayama|1957|p=12}} [[Nakayama Shōzen]], the second [[Shinbashira (Tenrikyo)|Shinbashira]], has suggested "oral record" (口記), contrasting with the ''Ofudesaki'' which he considered to be a "literal record."{{sfn|Nakayama|1957|pp=157–8}} The official English translations of the ''Ofudesaki'' and ''[[The Life of Oyasama]]'' render the term as "divine record."{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1996|p=117}}

==Interpretations==
In the latter half of the twentieth century, scholars began to publish interpretations of the creation narrative based on various disciplines such as [[ethnology]], [[cosmology]], [[philosophy]], [[comparative mythology]], [[psychology]], and [[biology]].{{sfn|Inoue|1998|p=338}}

'''Terrence Kaufman''' (born 1937) is an [[United States|American]] [[linguistics|linguist]] specializing in documentation of unwritten languages, [[lexicography]], [[Mesoamerica]]n [[historical linguistics]] and [[language contact]] phenomena. He is emeritus professor of the department of [[anthropology]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

==Academic career==
Kaufman received his PhD in Linguistics from the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1963. Kaufman has produced descriptive and comparative-historical studies of languages of the [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], [[Siouan languages|Siouan]], [[Hokan languages|Hokan]], [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]], [[Mixe–Zoquean languages|Mixe–Zoquean]] and [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] families.

Probably because of his focus on gathering empirical documentation of unwritten languages through fieldwork and training of native linguists, Kaufman's list of publications is less extensive than those of other scholars in the field. Nevertheless, many of his articles, often coauthored with other scholars such as [[Lyle Campbell]], [[Sarah Thomason]] and [[John Justeson]], have been highly influential.

In a 1976 paper coauthored with Lyle Campbell, he advanced a theory that the [[Olmec]]s spoke a [[Mixe–Zoquean]] language, based on the substantial presence of early Mixe–Zoquean loans in many Mesoamerican languages, particularly from specific, culturally significant semantic domains. This theory has come to be widely accepted, and is often cited as quasi-fact. Along with Lyle Campbell and Thomas Smith-Stark, Kaufman carried out research published in [[Linguistic Society of America|Language]] (1986) which led to the recognition of [[Mesoamerican Linguistic Area|Mesoamerica]] as a [[Sprachbund|linguistic area]].

In ''Language contact, creolization, and genetic linguistics'' (1988), coauthored by Kaufman and Sarah Thomason, the authors were the first to lay down a solid theoretical framework for the understanding of the processes of contact-induced language change. Kaufman's proposed genealogy of the indigenous languages of South America (Kaufman 1990), which stands as the most thorough and well-founded classification of its kind, serves as the basis for the classification presented by Lyle Campbell in his authoritative "American Indian Languages" (Campbell 1997).

Along with John Justeson, he claimed to have successfully deciphered the [[Isthmian script|Isthmian]] or [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] script (Justeson &amp; Kaufman 1993). This claim has not found general acceptance in the general scholarly community, and has been bluntly rejected by [[Michael Coe]] and [[Stephen Houston]] (Houston &amp; Coe 2004). Kaufman is currently involved in the "Project for the Documentation of the Languages of Mesoamerica" or PDLMA, focused on collecting standardized linguistic data from the underdocumented languages of Mesoamerica.

| Diplomatic relations ceased&lt;ref name=UK&gt;On 6 January 1950, the United Kingdom recognized the PRC and requested the exchange of ambassadors, but this was refused. The UK and The Netherlands established diplomatic relations at [[chargé d'affaires]] level with the PRC on 17 June 1954 and 19 November 1954 respectively while maintaining relations with the ROC. The PRC government does not regard the semi-diplomatic relations at chargé d'affaires level as formal diplomatic ties. The UK does. The PRC consented to the exchange of ambassadors with the UK on 13 March 1972 and with The Netherlands on 18 May 1972. See [[Sino-British relations]] for further details.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman also studied the relationship between science and social and political schools of theory. The William Coleman Dissertation Fellowship is named in his honor.

==Career==
[[File:Memorial Union and quadrangle.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Memorial Union (Wisconsin)|Memorial Union]] as seen from the Library Mall on the UW–Madison campus]]
Coleman was a distinguished professor in his field. During the course of his career he taught at both [[Johns Hopkins University]] (1961–1978) and achieved the title of Professor of History of Science and Humanistic Studies. In 1971, Coleman received a fellowship from the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] and spent a year at the Institute for Research in the Humanities at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. Although he ultimately returned to Johns Hopkins University when his fellowship ended, Coleman was awarded a second fellowship in 1977 from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and again returned to the Institute for Research in the Humanities at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In the culmination of his career, Coleman left Johns Hopkins University and began teaching at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (1978-1988). In 1978, the University of Wisconsin- Madison, appointed Coleman the title Professor of the History of Science and History of Medicine, and in 1984, Coleman received the honor of being named the Carol Dickson Bascom Professor in the Humanities. Professor Coleman served as President of the [[History of Science Society]] and was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]].

==William Coleman Dissertation Fellowship==
William Coleman passed away 28 April 1988, from Leukemia. In honor of his memory his widow, Louise S. Coleman, established the William Coleman Dissertation Fellowship in the History of Science at the Institute for Research in the Humanities located at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Coleman Dissertation Fellowship provides a one-semester stipend, currently assessed at $9,653, in addition to a tuition waiver and benefits, with additional printing, fax and photocopying privileges.&lt;ref&gt;https://histsci.wisc.edu/grads/funding/coleman.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an '''Émile Bernard chronology''' of the life and career of French artist, art critic and writer [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], based on documents hitherto published - however, most of the relevant sources remain unpublished. To a certain extent, these gaps can be filled by information derived from letters and biographies of e.g. [[Vincent van Gogh chronology|Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Émile Schuffenecker]]. Bernard and his work is associated with [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Cloisonnism]] and [[Synthetism]].

Since 1891, Bernard used to date his letters.

{{Anchor|1884}}
*'''1884–1886''': Stayed near Asnières (a fashionable suburb of Paris), argued with his father for wanting to become a painter, and entered the well-known atelier of [[Fernand Cormon]] in September. &lt;br/&gt;At that time, [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Louis Anquetin]], [[Eugène Boch]] and [[Paul Tampier]] (1859–1940) were studying with Cormon.&lt;ref name=SF&gt;Lit. ''A Sourcebook of Gauguin's Symbolist Followers ...,'' pp. 159-172&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br/&gt;At [[Père Tanguy]]'s shop, he first saw some of [[Cézanne]]'s paintings. Toulouse-Lautrec and Anquetin introduced young Bernard to [[Montmartre]]'s night life. In 1885, Bernard created his first important work, the woodblock ''La Nativité.''

==1886==
After having been expelled by Cormon for insubordinate behaviour&lt;ref name=SF/&gt; in early spring, 1886, his parents tried to convince him to work in business, which he refused.  &lt;br/&gt;Financially supported by the parents, Bernard instead went on a foot trip to Brittany. Recommended by [[Claude-Émile Schuffenecker]], whom he had met at Concarneau, he went to Pont-Aven in July, to see [[Paul Gauguin]] who however at first did not recognize Bernard's talent. Returned home after two months, he moved in with his parents, visited the exhibition of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants]] and saw the work of [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]].

*'''April/September''': on a foot trip to and through Brittany. Leaving Paris on April 6, bernard arrives via Nonancourt and Verneuil in Saint-Briac, at the end of the month in Le Ribay.

Via Saint-Brieuc, Tréguier, Morlaix, Landerneau, Pougastel-Daoulas, Douarnenez, Le Faouët, Quimper and Concarneau he arrives in Pont-Aven. Lorient, Carnac, Auray, Vannes and Rennes are the final places he visits, before he is back to Paris/Asnières - evidently before the closing of the exhibition of the ''Indépendants'':
*'''August 21''': Opening of the 2nd exhibition of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Artistes Indépendants]]; running through September 21.

==1887==
When his parents rented a house in Asnières, Émile was able to exhibit pointillist works there, early in the year, and was invited by Seurat to visit his studio. Bernard and Anquetin however soon decided to break with Neo-Impressionism and go their own way, painting flat colour areas but strong black contours.

At Tanguy's, Bernard met [[Lucien Pissarro]] and [[Charles Angrand]] at that time.

In spring, he returned to Brittany and stayed two months in Saint-Briac-sur-Mer, where he created stained glass windows. After his grandmother started to live with the family, they moved to a bigger house and built a studio for Émile.

*'''December/January (?)''': [[Vincent van Gogh]] arranges an exhibition of paintings by himself, Bernard, [[Louis Anquetin|Anquetin]], Koning and (probably) [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] in the ''Restaurant du Chalet'', 43 Avenue de Clichy, on Montmartre.

See Roland Dorn: ''Bernard on Van Gogh'', in: MaryAnne Stevens, ed.: Appendix B, pp. 381-383&lt;/ref&gt;

He first travelled Italy: On visits in Genova, Pisa, Rome and Florence he admired Perugino, Botticelli, Giotto, Simone Martini, Taddeo Gaddi and Fra Angelico. When meeting [[Dal Médico]], a fellow from Pont-Aven, he decided to accompany him to Constantinople via Samos. There, he got the commission to paint the chaple of Les Missionnaires de Lyon. He afterwards moved on to Smyrna, where Maria left him for a French photographer. Via Jerusalem and Alexandria, he arrived in Cairo by the end of the year. There, he had some income from decorating the chapel of the ''Pères de la Mission africaine de Lyon,'' but still was supported by Bonger and de La Rochefouauld.

==1894==

Married ''Hannénah Saati,'' of Libanese descent, on July 1 and started living like an Arab, whilst reading Fathers of the Church (St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas) and philosophers like Hegel, Aristotle and Plato, for becoming inspired. Still was, to some extent, supported by his family. To the 5th album of André Marty's L'Estampe originale, he contributed a print.

==1895==

Bernard's first son, Otse, was born. The painter was commissioned with frescoes for the chapel of Cairo's Cathédrale de la Vierge and looked for inspiration in Michelangelo's oeuvre.

His sister Madeleine, terminally ill with tuberculosis, moved to Cairo, where she died on November 19.

==1896==

For their difficult financial situation, the family moved to Spain, reaching Granada in August and Seville in December. Hannénah became ill of tuberculosis.

==1897==
In spring, Bernard met Spanish painter Zuloaga; after the birth of a second son, Fortunato, they moved back to Cairo to live with Hannénah's family. Both sons died of tuberculosis, soon later.

==1898==

==1900s==
*'''1900''': Travelling towards France, the family stayed in Venice for a while before returning to Cairo due to Odilo's illness. The child died there shortly after arrival, but a fourth son, Antoine, was born same year.
*'''1901''': Prompted by de La Rochefoucauld, Bernard went to France for three months, exhibited in Ambroise Vollard's gallery and met (not for the first time) poet and theatre manager Paul Fort, becoming involved with his sister Andrée who would accompany him to Cairo.
*'''1902''': Daughter Irène, born to Hannénah.
*'''1903''': After founding Le Parnasse, a short-lived review publication, Bernard left Cairo for Venice in March, accompanied by Andrée, Irène and Antoine. He returned to Cairo in October to definitely separate from Hannénah and went back to France, taking both children with him.
*'''1904''': On the way to Paris, Bernard stopped for a visit at Cézanne's place in Aix-en-Provence, then decided to establish his more-or-less permanent home in Tonnerre-sur-Yonne (Bourgogne), whilst spending the winter in Naples.
*'''1905—1912''': On return from Naples, Bernard met Cézanne again. La Rénovation esthétique was founded to propagate increasingly reactionary Catholic points of view. He from now mostly travelled between Paris and Tonnerre and produced a vast output of art critic's essays, poems, plays, book illustrations, but also paintings (towards 1910, mainly landscapes). Around 1907, he visited Andries Bonger in the Netherlands and portrayed him and his wife. In 1908, he exposed three of his paintings at the Post-Impressionist exhibition in Prague, having been invited by Milos Marten, who admired his art. In 1910, he had a whole room in the Musée Baudouin (Paris) to exhibit his Orientalist work. At that time, working on his career, he was hardly concerned about Andrée and the children. In December 1911, heirship after his father's death allowed him a better life.

==1910s==
*'''1910''': Bernard's friend [[Eugène Boch]] moves to his new house Villa La Grimpette &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugeneboch.com/grimpette.htm "La Grimpette, house of Eugène Boch"]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Monthyon]] - Émile Bernard becomes a fréquent guest to this house.
*'''1913—1921''': Bernard showed some of his woodcuts at the Circle des librairies, in 1913. Having fallen in love with Persian Armène Ohanian, he lived with her in Villeneuve-les-Avignon for three years, where he decorated the church with frescoes. Besides, created woodcuts for Les Amours de Ronsard, Les Fleurs du mal, and François Villon. After Armène had left him, he stayed in Tonnerre until the end of the war; in 1919, returned to Paris and lived with one Mme Duchâteau and Irène.

==1920s==
*'''1922-1925''': Stayed in Italy, where he was well respected: Exhibited at the 1922 Venice Biennale and at the 1923 Rome Biennale. Major paintings created during that period were Le Christ guérissant les malades, Les Héros et les dieux, Le Doute, La Construction du temple. Le Cycle humain is to be mentioned.
*'''1927''': Having left Italy by the end of 1925, he travelled the Loire Valley, gave lectures and organized conferences on art.

==1930s==
*'''1937''': death of his wife Hannénah
*'''1938''': Bernard marries Andrée Fort, but prefers living alone in Pont-Aven until 1940.

'''Émile Bréhier''' ({{IPA-fr|bʁeje|lang}}; 12 April 1876, [[Bar-le-Duc]] – 3 February 1952, Paris) was a French philosopher. His interest was in classical philosophy, and the history of philosophy. He wrote a ''Histoire de la Philosophie'', translated into English in seven volumes.

==Life==
Bréhier studied at the [[University of Paris]]. In 1908 he received his doctorate at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] with a [[dissertation]] about [[Philo of Alexandria]]. He was [[Henri Bergson]]'s successor at the University of Paris in 1945. The historian [[Louis Bréhier]] was his brother.

==Work==
He was an early follower of Bergson; in the 1930s there was an influential view that Bergsonism and [[Neoplatonism]] were linked.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Andrew Passavant, Jodi Dean, ''Empire's New Clothes: Reading Hardt and Negri'' (2004), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;
