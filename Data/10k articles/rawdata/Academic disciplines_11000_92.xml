'''Aardvark''' was a [[social search]] service that connected users live with friends or friends-of-friends who were able to answer their questions, also known as a [[knowledge market]]. Users submitted questions via the Aardvark website, email or instant messenger and Aardvark identified and facilitated a live chat or email conversation with one or more topic experts in the 'askers' extended social network. Aardvark was  used for asking subjective questions for which human judgment or recommendation was desired. It was also used extensively for technical support questions.  Users could also review  question and answer history and other settings on the Aardvark website.  [[Google]] acquired Aardvark for $50 million on February 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 12, 2010

== History ==

== Interaction model ==
When a user joined Aardvark, aardvark was added to the user's IM buddylist. Users submitted questions by email or IM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 11, 2009
   |url=https://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/03/chacha-and-aardvark-putting-humans-to-work-to-get-you-the-answers-you-need/
   |title=ChaCha And Aardvark: Putting Humans To Work To Get You The Answers You Need
   |work=techcrunch
   |publisher=techcrunch.com
   |quote=You can ask questions via an instant message buddy or email.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090323220047/http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/03/chacha-and-aardvark-putting-humans-to-work-to-get-you-the-answers-you-need/| archivedate= March 23, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Aardvark guided the user through the question process by providing messages that confirmed receipt of the question and explained any actions required of the user.  IM users were able to use a variety of "IM commands"—one word messages that could be used to fine-tune the question parameters, invite new users, or get help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 11, 2009
   |url=http://i-penny.com/aardvark-a-better-social-qa-than-twitter/

   |work=i-penny.com
   |publisher=i-penny.com
   |quote=Aardvark features a number of simple commands that allow you to interact with the service and that are always explained in your conversations with Aardvark.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two main interaction flows available in Aardvark for answering a question. The primary flow involved Aardvark sending a message to the user (via IM, email, etc.) asking if the user would like to answer a question. Periodically, Aardvark contacted users via email or IM when it believed they were well-suited to answer another user's question. Aardvark searched through one's friends and friends' friends also. Instead of sending the question to every friend it found, it searched a person's profile to see if there were information related to the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 11, 2009
   |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/aardvark_25_invites.php
   |title=Aardvark, a better social q&amp;a than twitter
   |work=readwriteweb.com
   |publisher=readwriteweb.com
   |quote=In return, Aardvark will also send you a few questions every day that fit your profile.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090312044322/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/aardvark_25_invites.php| archivedate= March 12, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Aardvark sent a question to the user, if the user responded affirmatively, Aardvark relayed the question as well as the name of the questioner. The user could then simply type an answer to the question, a friend's name or email address to refer to someone who may know the answer or simply type in "pass" to pass on the request. Aardvark sent such requests for answers less than once a day to a given user (and users could easily change contact settings, specify preferred frequency and time of the day for such requests).&lt;ref name="Damon Horowitz,Sepandar D. Kamvar"&gt;{{citation
   |url=http://vark.com/aardvarkFinalWWW2010.pdf
   |title=The Anatomy of a Large Scale Social Search Engine
   |author=Damon Horowitz,Sepandar D. Kamvar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aardvark supported Google Talk, Windows Live Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 11, 2009
   |url=http://i-penny.com/aardvark-a-better-social-qa-than-twitter/
   |title=Aardvark, a better social qa than twitter
   |work=i-penny.com
   |publisher=i-penny.com
   |quote=Aardvark supports Google Talk, AIM, and Microsoft's Live Messenger.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary flow of answering questions was more similar to traditional bulletin-board style interactions: a user sent a message to Aardvark or visited the "Answering" tab of the website, Aardvark showed the user a recent question from the user's network which had not yet been answered and which was related to the user's profile topics. This mode involved the user initiating the exchange when the user was in the mood to try to answer a question; as such, it had the benefit of tapping into users who acted as eager potential 'answerers'.&lt;ref name="Damon Horowitz,Sepandar D. Kamvar"/&gt;

In all of the interfaces, wrappers around messages from another user included information about the user to facilitate trust: the user's real name, age, gender, the social connection between the two users, a section of topics the user had expertise in, and summary statistics of the user's activity on Aardvark.&lt;ref name="Damon Horowitz,Sepandar D. Kamvar"/&gt;

== Funding and economic strategies ==
The Mechanical Zoo was privately held, prior to acquisition by Google. Initial funding was in early 2008, with $750,000 in convertible debt from angel investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 13, 2012

Abrams’ law is a special case of a general rule formulated empirically by Feret:


S=A/B&lt;sup&gt;w/c&lt;/sup&gt;

S = strength of concrete

A and B are constants 

w/c is water-cement ratio varies from 0.3 to 1.20

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7407">An '''abstract family of acceptors (AFA)''' is a grouping of generalized [[Finite state machine#Acceptors_and_recognizers|acceptors]]. Informally, an acceptor is a device with a finite state control, a finite number of input symbols, and an internal store with a read and write function. Each acceptor has a start state and a set of accepting states. The device reads a sequence of symbols, transitioning from state to state for each input symbol. If the device ends in an accepting state, the device is said to accept the sequence of symbols. A family of acceptors is a set of acceptors with the same type of internal store. The study of AFA is part of AFL ([[abstract family of languages|abstract families of languages]]) theory. &lt;ref name="Seymour"&gt;[[Seymour Ginsburg]], ''Algebraic and automata theoretic properties of formal languages'', North-Holland, 1975, {{ISBN|0-7204-2506-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definitions==

===AFA Schema===
An ''AFA Schema'' is an ordered 4-tuple &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma, I, f, g)&lt;/math&gt;, where
# &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are nonempty abstract sets.
# &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the ''write'' function: &lt;math&gt;f : \Gamma^* \times I \rightarrow \Gamma^* \cup \{\empty\}&lt;/math&gt; (N.B. * is the [[Kleene star]] operation).
# &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the ''read'' function, a mapping from &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt; into the finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;g (\epsilon) = \{ \epsilon \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;g(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. (N.B. &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the empty word).
# For each &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;g(\Gamma^*)&lt;/math&gt;, there is an element &lt;math&gt;1_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma', 1_\gamma) = \gamma'&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\gamma'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;g(\gamma')&lt;/math&gt;.
# For each ''u'' in ''I'', there exists a finite set &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_u&lt;/math&gt;  ⊆ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, such that if &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1&lt;/math&gt;  ⊆ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1^*&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma,u) \ne \empty&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma,u)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_u)^*&lt;/math&gt;.

===Abstract family of acceptors===
An ''abstract family of acceptors (AFA)'' is an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; such that:
#&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an ordered 6-tuple (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;), where

==Informal discussion==

===AFA Schema===
An AFA schema defines a store or memory with read and write function. The symbols in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; are called ''storage symbols'' and the symbols in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are called ''instructions''. The write function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; returns a new storage state given the current storage state and an instruction. The read function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; returns the current state of memory. Condition (3) insures the empty storage configuration is distinct from other configurations. Condition (4)  requires there be an identity instruction that allows the state of memory to remain unchanged while the acceptor changes state or advances the input. Condition (5) assures that the set of storage symbols for any given acceptor is finite.

===Abstract family of acceptors===
An AFA is the set of all acceptors over a given pair of state and input alphabets which have the same storage mechanism defined by a given AFA schema. The &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; relation defines one step in the operation of an acceptor.  &lt;math&gt;L_f(D)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of words accepted by acceptor &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; by having the acceptor enter an accepting state. &lt;math&gt;L(D)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of words accepted by acceptor &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; by having the acceptor simultaneously enter an accepting state and having an empty storage.

The abstract acceptors defined by AFA are generalizations of other types of acceptors (e.g. [[finite state automata]], [[pushdown automata]], etc.). They have a finite state control like other automata, but their internal storage may vary widely from the stacks and tapes used in classical automata.

==Results from AFL theory==
The main result from AFL theory is that a family of languages &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a full AFL if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; for some AFA &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt;.  Equally important is the result that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a full semi-AFL if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_f(\mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; for some AFA &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Origins==

[[Seymour Ginsburg]] of the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Sheila Greibach]] of [[Harvard University]] first presented their AFL theory paper at the [[IEEE]] Eighth Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory in 1967.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2891921 IEEE conference record of 1967 Eighth Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory] : papers presented at the Eighth Annual Symposium, University of Texas, October 18-20, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromley]]{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=14}} }}

The '''academic study of new religious movements''' is known as '''new religions studies'''' ('''NRS''').{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2004|1p=83|2a1=Bromley|2y=2012|2p=13}}
The study draws from the disciplines of [[anthropology]], [[psychiatry]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[religious studies]], and [[theology]].&lt;ref name="Teaching bromley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Disciplinary Perspectives on New Religious Movements: Views of from the Humanities and Social Sciences|encyclopedia=Teaching New Religious Movements|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001/acprof-9780195177299-chapter-3|accessdate=2014-03-17|date=|author=Sablia, John A.|edition=|pages=41–63|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001|editor=David G. Brohmley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eileen Barker]] noted that there five sources of information on [[new religious movements]] (NRMs): the information provided by such groups themselves, that provided by ex-members as well as the friends and relatives of members, organisations that collect information on NRMs, the mainstream media, and academics studying such phenomena.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=vii-ix}}

The study of new religions is unified by its topic of interest, rather than by its [[methodology]], and is therefore [[interdisciplinary]] in nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=16}} A sizeable body of scholarly literature on new religions has been published, most of it produced by [[social science|social scientists]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2012|1p=13|2a1=Hammer|2a2=Rothstein|2y=2012|2p=2}} Among the disciplines that NRS uses are anthropology, history, psychology, religious studies, and sociology.{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} Of these approaches, sociology played a particularly prominent role in the development of the field,{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} resulting in it being initially confined largely to a narrow array of sociological questions.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}} This came to change in later scholarship, which began to apply theories and methods initially developed for examining more mainstream religions to the study of new ones.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}}

The majority of research has been directed toward those new religions which have attracted a greater deal of public controversy; less controversial NRMs have tended to be the subject of less scholarly research.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} It has also been noted that scholars of new religions have often avoided researching certain movements which tend instead to be studied by scholars from other backgrounds; the [[feminist spirituality]] movement is usually examined by scholars of [[women's studies]], African-American new religions by scholars of [[Africana studies]], and Native American new religions by scholars of [[Native American studies]].{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}}

==Historical development==
{{double image|right|Massimo Introvigne.jpg|208|Eileen Barker.jpg|140|Scholarly organisations devoted to the study of NRMs have been formed by academics like Massimo Introvigne (left) and Eileen Barker (right)}}

In Japan, the academic study of new religions appeared in the years following the Second World War.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=3}}&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Eugene V 2007"&gt;Gallagher, Eugene V. 2007. "Compared to What? 'Cults' and 'New Religious Movements.'" History of Religions 47(2/3): 212.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s American sociologist [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] lived with Unification Church [[missionary]] [[Young Oon Kim]] and a small group of American church members in California and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121122133/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm |date=2012-01-21 }}, [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113080905/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: 'The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes', and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]] as ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of [[religious conversion]], as well as one of the first sociological studies of a new religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

In Western nations the study of new religions became a distinct field in the 1970s;{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} prior to this, new religions had been examined from varying perspectives, with [[Pentecostalism]] for instance being studied by [[church history|church historians]] and [[cargo cults]] by anthropologists.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} This Western  academic study of new religions emerged in response to growing public concerns regarding the emergence of various NRMs during the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=17}} By the latter part of that decade, increasing numbers of papers on new religions were being presented at the annual conferences of the [[American Academy of Religion]], [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]], and the [[Association for the Sociology of Religion]].{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} The manner in which the scholarly study of new religions rose to prominence due to the public perception that these movements were social threats bore similarities with the manner in which [[Islamic studies]] grew in Western nations following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}} The study of new religions would only be fully embraced by the Western [[religious studies]] establishment in the 1990s.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}}

In 1988, the charity [[INFORM]] (Information Network Focus on Religious Movements) was established by Barker, who was then a professor of sociology at the [[London School of Economics]]. The organisation was supported by the UK Home Office and the British established churches and was designed to conduct research and disseminate accurate information about new religions.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=105–106}}
Barker established INFORM due to her "conviction that a great deal of unnecessary suffering has resulted from ignorance of the nature and characteristics of the current wave of [NRMs] in the West."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=vii}}
Also in 1988, the Italian scholar [[Massimo Introvigne]] established [[CESNUR]] (Centre for Studies on New Religions) in [[Turin]]; it brought together academics studying NRMs in both Europe and North America.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=106–107}} In the United States, CESNUR gained representation through the [[Institute for the Study of American Religion]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]], which was directed by [[J. Gordon Melton]].{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=107}}

Scholars of new religion often operate in a politicised environment given that their research can be cited in legal briefs and judicial decisions regarding NRMs.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} In Barker's view, academic research into NRMs had practical applications in dealing with the problems that people experience with regard to NRMs.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=x–xi}} It can, for example, provide accurate information about a particular religious movement that can help guide an individual's reactions to the group; "an awareness of the complexity of a situation might help people to avoid precipitous actions that would later have been regretted."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=xi}} However, given that scholars of new religions often reject the stereotypes about "cults" promoted by the anti-cultist movements, they have often been criticised by proponents of the latter.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} Anti-cult groups have sometimes criticised scholarly groups such as these, claiming that they uncritically believe what NRMs tell them, that they are pro-NRM, or that they ignore the issues raised by ex-members.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=109}} They sometimes have accused academic researchers of being "[[cult apologists]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=21}}

A '''canon''' in the sphere of [[visual arts]] and [[aesthetics]], or an '''aesthetic canon''', is a rule for [[Body proportions|proportions]], so as to produce a harmoniously formed figure.

==Evolution==
{{Main|Female body shape}}
By extension, the norms of a certain epoch as to what is or is not considered beautiful may be called a '''canon of beauty'''. These norms have varied over time and what is considered beautiful in one era may not necessarily be so in another. Canons of beauty follow the evolution of [[fashion]] and are dependent on the evolution of physical decoration techniques such as [[hairdressing]] or [[make up]].

Under France's [[Ancien Régime]], canons of beauty required a woman to have as white a skin as possible. This was achieved (sometimes to the danger of health) by [[rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]] and [[face powder]]s as well as 'mouches', fake moles made of black muslin glued onto the face or chest. Today, by contrast, such canons prefer a 'healthier' skin colour, sportiness, gait and so on.

According to the anthropologist Alfred-Louis Kroeber, the female silhouette regularly revolves through one of three basic shapes&amp;mdash;[[bustle]], [[scabbard]], [[bell (instrument)|bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Nathalie Bailleux and Bruno Remaury, ''Modes et vêtements'', collection “[[Découvertes Gallimard]]” (nº 239), series Culture et société, Éditions Gallimard ({{ISBN|2-07-053270-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proportions in art==
{{See also|Body proportions}}
For his painting ''The Birth of Venus'' [[Sandro Botticelli]] stated that the distance between the nipple and navel, between the two legs and between the navel and the groin must all be equal for a figure to (in his opinion) be ideally proportioned. Other such systems of 'ideal proportions' in painting and sculpture include the [[Polyclitean canon]] and [[Vitruvian module]]s, best known in the [[Vitruvian Man]].

Akvo also operates the sustainable development wiki Akvopedia, which as of 2017 has 1956 content pages about water, sanitation and agriculture. Akvo was initially started as a project under the Netherlands Water Partnership in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dutchwatersector.com |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/20871-stockholm-world-water-week-2016-akvo-celebrates-ten-years-online-monitoring.html |title=Because big challenges need joint solutions |publisher=Dutch Water Sector |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akvo operates from 11 offices worldwide. Akvo has hub offices based in a number of different locations, including [[Stockholm]], [[London]], [[Washington DC]], [[Nairobi]] and [[New Delhi]]. As of 2017, Akvo operates in 93 countries and works with more than 1800 organizations around the world from [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] to national governments and multilateral aid organizations who use Akvo’s tools to report, publish, monitor and evaluate their work.&lt;ref name="nlembassy1"&gt;[http://ethiopia.nlembassy.org/binaries/content/assets/postenweb/e/ethiopie/netherlands-embassy-in-addis-ababa/services/general-information/ekn-water-directory.pdf] {{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the foundation's work is concentrated within the water and sanitation sector. However, since 2010 it has widened its focus to areas such as health, education, technology, agriculture and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Akvo Foundation |url=http://akvo.org/about-us/akvo-faq/#whywatsan |title=Akvo Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Thomas Bjelkeman-Pettersson and Jeroen van der Sommen met at Stockholm [[World Water Week]] in 2006. At this time it was becoming clear that the [[Millennium Development Goals]] on water was going to be difficult to achieve and as a result there was the need to develop new ideas. Shortly thereafter, the idea of using open source software and open data for the development sector was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/20871-stockholm-world-water-week-2016-akvo-celebrates-ten-years-online-monitoring-water-aid-projects.html |title=Because big challenges need joint solutions |publisher=Dutch Water Sector |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in 2008 the Akvo Foundation was formed by the [[Netherlands Water Partnership]] and several other co founders, including Bjelkeman-Pettersson and van der Sommen as well as Mark Nitzberg, Mark Charmer, Gabriel von Heijne and Peter van der Linde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.vn.nl/thomas-bjelkeman-pettersson/ |title=Thomas Bjelkeman-Pettersson - Vrij Nederland |website=Vn.nl |date=2007-10-27 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Early timeline'''

September 2006 - Seed funding is provided by Netherlands Water Partnership (NWP). The partner organisations that participate in brainstorming about what Akvo should become are [[UNESCO]]-IHE, IRC International Resource Centre for Water and Sanitation (IRC) and the Movement Design Bureau.

April 2007 – Partners for Water and NWP provide the first batch of funding.

August 2007 – Akvopedia is shown for the first time at World Water Week.

In 2015, Akvo was named as the winner of the [[Water and Sanitation Award]]. The award was in recognition of Akvo’s innovation within the water and sanitation sector in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iadb.org/es/noticias/comunicados-de-prensa/2015-11-17/ganadores-premio-bid-femsa,11324.html?WT.mc_id=NewsEmail_Short_11324&amp;wtSrc=Email&amp;wtType=Short&amp;wtArticleID=11324&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in November 2015, Akvo was awarded the [[Dutch Water Innovation Prize]]. Akvo won the award for the development of a smart irrigation inlet sensor that measures the salinity of surface water.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uvw.nl/waterinnovatieprijs-2015-uitgereikt/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo RSR''' (Really Simple Reporting) was launched in September 2008 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/38f27bf8-4a54-11de-8e7e-00144feabdc0 |title=Donor programmes: Sponsors can now view benefits online |website=Ft.com |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first product Akvo developed; it is a content management and reporting system for international development projects. It was described by Giulio Quaggiotto of the World Bank as "Real-time, paper-free, straight from the trenches reporting. If RSR takes off, it could be the killer application of Development 2.0".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/forget-rss-is-real-simple-reporting-the-killer-development-20-application |title=Forget RSS: is Real Simple Reporting the killer Development 2.0 application? &amp;#124; Private Sector Development |website=Blogs.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now over 4000 projects on the platform, with a combined value of over €150 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/akvo-rsr-supporting-use-of-open-data |title=Akvo RSR: Supporting use of Open Data &amp;#124; International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) |website=Aidtransparency.net |date=2015-09-22 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvopedia''' was created in 2007 and was the first project that Akvo worked on. It is a Web-based, free content, water and sanitation knowledge resource. Akvopedia is written collaboratively by volunteers and specialists, mainly from the water and sanitation sector but anyone can edit and contribute. It is organised within five portals – Water, Sanitation, Finance, Sustainability and Decision &amp; assessment tools. Recently some of this content has been transferred to Wikiversity in the Rainwater Harvesting portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting |title=Rainwater harvesting - Wikiversity |publisher=En.wikiversity.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo Sites''' is a [[Wordpress]] based system for easy creation and maintenance of websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Akvo Foundation |url=http://akvo.org/products/akvo-sites/ |title=Akvo Sites |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo Caddisfly''' is a [[water quality]] and [[soil quality]] testing system based on [[smartphones]]. Akvo Caddisfly was originally invented by Ternup Research Labs to detect the precedes of [[fluoride]] in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716301553 |title=Monitoring of fluoride in water samples using a smartphone |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05 |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.156 |volume=551-552 |journal=Science of the Total Environment |pages=101–107 | last1 = Levin | first1 = Saurabh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ternup joined forces with Akvo in early 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caddisfly.ternup.com/partnering-with-akvo/ |title=Partnering with Akvo &amp;#124; Caddisfly |website=Caddisfly.ternup.com |date=2015-01-05 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caddisfly system has been extended to work with strip tests and phone-connected sensors as well as the original colorimetric tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://akvo.org/akvo-caddisfly/ |title=Akvo Caddisfly |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo Lumen''' is a data visualisation platform and is Akvo's latest product. It is developed in the [[Clojure]] programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/clojure-in-akvo.html |title=JUXT Blog: Clojure in Europe: Akvo |website=Juxt.pro |date=2016-05-23 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Innovative communication ==
Akvo has gained notoriety for its unique external communication. Bruce Sterling said "It's an open-source sanitation project, and if that isn’t weird enough, they’ve got a Bollywood-parody promotional angle." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/06/akvos-bollywood/ |title=Akvo’s Bollywood Angle |publisher=WIRED |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Geographic Society]] reported from [[World Water Week in Stockholm]] about the WaterCube, the brainchild of Mark Charmer at Akvo: "Man-on-the-street journalism meets wonky water week. Frenetic water cube workers ushered a steady stream of conference attendees into their fishbowl lounge for quick Flip camera interviews. The close-ups may not be flattering, but it is interesting to hear the stream of consciousness that pours from the mouths of the unprepared and unedited. From high-profile corporate and academic leadership to those implementing projects on the ground around the world, the resulting online mosaic of more than 200 interviews collected over the last two years seems to present a near-complete view of the issues covered over six days of workshops, plenary sessions, and panels." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maxwell |first=David |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2010/09/09/world-water-week-best-design/ |title=World Water Week: Best in Design – National Geographic Society (blogs) |website=Voices.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-09-09 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent notable projects and partnerships ==
'''Akvopedia expands into Wikiversity:''' In 2015, Akvopedia begun loading content into [[Wikiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.susana.org/component/kunena/196-capacity-development/15007-akvopedia-expands-into-wikiversity-which-offers-free-learning-materials-starting-with-rainwater-harvesting-section |title=SuSanA Forum |website=Forum.susana.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akvopedia has served as source content for the Wikiversity portal and the [[Rainwater harvesting portal]].

'''Monitoring water points during drought in Ethiopia:''' In 2016, Akvo worked with UNICEF to collect data during the worst drought in over 50 years in Ethiopia. Akvo recorded over 80,000 survey responses which were used to help direct emergency resources to the most relevant areas.&lt;ref name="nlembassy1"/&gt;

'''Supporting Government disaster planning and response systems:''' Since 2014, Akvo has worked in Fiji, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands to introduce locally run mobile-based data and asset management tools to improve the quality and availability of data for disaster-related decision-making.  For this work Akvo won the innovationXchange award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacifichumanitarianchallenge.org/winners/#VanuatuDRPlatform |title=Innovators - InnovationXchange |website=Pacifichumanitarianchallenge.org |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Akvo Flow was used in Fiji to collect data on the extent of the damage caused by [[Cyclone Winston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/appeals/files/UNICEF_Pacific_Cyclone_Winston_External_SitRep_26Feb2016.pdf |format=PDF |title=Cyclone Winston : Fiji : UNICEF Report |website=Unicef.org |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}

'''Anthropology''' is the study of [[human]]s and [[human behavior]] and [[society|societies]] in the past and present.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web | title=anthropology | url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology |work=Oxford Dictionaries | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology | title=anthropology | work=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{cite web | title=What is Anthropology? | url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm | publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]] | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anthropology]] and [[cultural anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; study the norms and values of societies. [[Linguistic anthropology]] studies how language affects social life. [[Biological anthropology|Biological or physical anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; studies the biological development of humans.

[[Archaeology]], which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States and Canada, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history.

==Origin and development of the term==
[[File:Sahagun.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Bernardino de Sahagún]] is considered to be the founder of modern anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/43462&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|History of anthropology}}
The abstract noun ''[[wikt:anthropology|anthropology]]'' is first attested in reference to [[history]].&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[Richard Harvey (astrologer)|Richard Harvey]]'s 1593 ''Philadelphus'', a defense of the legend of [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] in [[History of Britain|British history]], includes the passage "Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did. This part of History is named Anthropology."}} Its present use first appeared in [[German Renaissance|Renaissance]] [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] in the works of [[Magnus Hundt]] and [[Otto Casmann]].&lt;ref name="Medicine"&gt;{{cite book|author=Israel Institute of the History of Medicine|title=Koroth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lev_H1Ie0zcC&amp;pg=PA19|publisher=BRILL|page=19|id=GGKEY:34XGYHLZ7XY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[New Latin]] ''{{lang|la|anthropologia}}'' derived from the [[combining form]]s of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''ánthrōpos'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἄνθρωπος}}}}, "[[human]]") and ''lógos'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|λόγος}}}}, "[[science|study]]").&lt;ref name=oed2&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st&amp;nbsp;ed. "anthropology, ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; (Its adjectival form appeared in the works of [[Aristotle]].)&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt; It began to be used in English, possibly via [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|Anthropologie}}'', by the early 18th century.&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[John Kersey]]'s 1706 edition of ''[[The New World of English Words]]'' includes the definition "''Anthropology'', a Discourse or Description of Man, or of a Man's Body."}}

===Through the 19th century===
In 1647, the Bartholins, founders of the [[University of Copenhagen]], defined ''{{lang|fr|l'anthropologie}}'' as follows:&lt;ref name=frenchy&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bartholin | first1=Caspar | last2=Bartholin | first2=Thomas | author-link1=Caspar Bartholin the Younger | author-link2=Thomas Bartholin | others=Translated from the Latin by Abr. Du Prat | year=1647 | title=Institutions anatomiques de Gaspar Bartholin, augmentées et enrichies pour la seconde fois tant des opinions et observations nouvelles des modernes | location=Paris | publisher=M. Hénault et J. Hénault | chapter=Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anthropology, that is to say the science that treats of man, is divided ordinarily and with reason into Anatomy, which considers the body and the parts, and Psychology, which speaks of the soul.{{refn|group=n|In French: ''L'Anthropologie, c'est à dire la science qui traite de l'homme, est divisée ordinairment &amp; avec raison en l'Anatomie, qui considere le corps &amp; les parties, et en la Psychologie, qui parle de l'Ame''.&lt;ref name=frenchy/&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by [[Étienne Serres]] in 1839 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)]] by [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau]]. Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed. The [[Société Ethnologique de Paris]], the first to use [[Ethnology]], was formed in 1839. Its members were primarily anti-slavery activists. When slavery was abolished in France in 1848 the Société was abandoned.

Meanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the [[American Ethnological Society]], was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the [[Ethnological Society of London]] in 1843, a break-away group of the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]].&lt;ref name=Schiller131&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|pp=130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-[[Human rights|human-rights activists.]] They maintained international connections.

Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in such diverse fields as [[comparative anatomy|anatomy]], [[Comparative method (linguistics)|linguistics]], and [[Ethnology]], making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in [[agronomy]] and in the wild.

Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. [[Paul Broca]] in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the [[Société de biologie]] to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the [[Society of Anthropology of Paris|Société d'Anthropologie de Paris]], meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859.&lt;ref name=Fletcher&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Fletcher | chapter=Paul Broca and the French School of Anthropology | title=The Saturday Lectures, Delivered in the Lecture-room of the U. S. National Museum under the Auspices of the Anthropological and Biological Societies of Washington in March and April 1882 | year=1882 | location=Boston; Washington, D.C. | publisher=D. Lothrop &amp; Co.; Judd &amp; Detweiler | url={{Google books|9dEJAQAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|As [[Robert Fletcher (anthropologist)|Fletcher]] points out, the French society was by no means the first to include anthropology or parts of it as its topic. Previous organizations used other names. The German Anthropological Association of St. Petersburg, however, in fact met first in 1861, but due to the death of its founder never met again.&lt;ref name=Fletcher/&gt;}} When he read Darwin, he became an immediate convert to ''Transformisme'', as the French called [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; His definition now became "the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broca, being what today would be called a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]], had taken an interest in the pathology of speech. He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called [[Broca's area]] after him. His interest was mainly in [[Biological anthropology]], but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, [[Theodor Waitz]], took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled ''Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker'', 1859–1864. The title was soon translated as "The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples". The last two volumes were published posthumously.

Waitz defined anthropology as "the science of the nature of man". By nature he meant matter animated by "the Divine breath";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., he was an [[Animism|animist]]. Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from "the animals nearest to him". He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of civilization, as well as ethnology, are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that "the same laws of thought are applicable to all men".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waitz was influential among the British ethnologists. In 1863 the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] and the speech therapist [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] broke away from the [[Ethnological Society of London]] to form the [[Anthropological Society of London]], which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French ''Société'' were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, ''The Anthropological Review'', Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard.&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|loc=Introductory Address}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Hunt's choice of theorists does not exclude the numerous other theorists that were beginning to publish a large volume of anthropological studies.&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt;}} Among the first associates were the young [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], inventor of [[cultural anthropology]], and his brother [[Alfred Tylor]], a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.

Similar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the [[Berliner Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte|Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory]] (1869) founded by [[Rudolph Virchow]], known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation.

During the last three decades of the 19th century, a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898 the American Association for the Advancement of Science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  title=Extent of Instruction in Anthropology in Europe and the United States | first=George Grant | last=Maccurdy | journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science | year=1899 | pages=382–390 | url={{Google books|PA385&amp;dq|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===
This meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world's higher educational institutions, many thousands in number. Anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. Practical Anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene. The organization has reached global level. For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA), "a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology", currently contains members from about three dozen nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Home | publisher=World Council of Anthropological Associations | accessdate=29 March 2015 | url= http://www.wcaanet.org/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the work of [[Franz Boas]] and [[Bronisław Malinowski]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, ''social'' anthropology in Great Britain and [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'' anthropology]] in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on [[cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]], long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on [[Participant observation|participant-observation]] or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology, in particular, has emphasized [[cultural relativism]], [[holism]], and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79"&gt;Hylland Eriksen, Thomas. (2004) "What is Anthropology" Pluto. London. p. 79. {{ISBN|0745323200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from [[Boasian anthropology|Boas' arguments]] against 19th-century racial [[ideology]], through [[Margaret Mead]]'s advocacy for [[gender equality]] and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of [[post-colonialism|post-colonial]] oppression and promotion of [[multiculturalism]]. [[Ethnography]] is one of its primary [[research design]]s as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiro1987"&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) "Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason," in ''Culture and Human Nature: Theoretical Papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp.&amp;nbsp;32–58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyck1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyck|first1=Thomas William|last2=Stocking|first2=George W.|last3=Goody|first3=Jack|title=After Tylor: British Social Anthropology 1888–1951.|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=102|issue=5|year=1997|pages=1486–1488|issn=0002-8762|doi=10.2307/2171126|jstor=2171126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of [[social anthropology]] tends to dominate. In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the [[four field approach]] developed by [[Franz Boas]] in the early 20th century: [[Biological anthropology|''biological'' or ''physical'' anthropology]]; [[social anthropology|''social'']], [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'']], or [[sociocultural anthropology|''sociocultural'' anthropology]]; and [[archaeology]]; plus [[linguistic anthropology|anthropological linguistics]]. These fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.

European countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more [[ethnology]] (a term coined and defined by [[Adam František Kollár|Adam F. Kollár]] in 1783). It is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert (1998) ''An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from [[natural science]]s, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'', human physical traits, [[human behavior]], the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of ''Homo sapiens'' has influenced its social organization and culture, and from [[social science]]s, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm What is Anthropology – American Anthropological Association].

According to [[Clifford Geertz]],
{{quotation|"anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth-century conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact. Long after natural history, moral philosophy, philology, and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors, it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology, human biology, comparative linguistics, and prehistory, held together mainly by the vested interests, sunk costs, and administrative habits of academia, and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London|pages=Back Cover|editor1=Daniel A.

[[Sociocultural anthropology]] has been heavily influenced by [[structuralism|structuralist]] and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an [[epistemological]] shift away from the [[positivist]] traditions that had largely informed the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Behar, Clifford &amp; James&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.

===Sociocultural===
{{main|Cultural anthropology|Social anthropology|Sociocultural anthropology}}
Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[social anthropology]]. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people ''make sense'' of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the ''relationships'' among individuals and groups.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994pxv"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=GENERAL INTRODUCTION | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold| year=1994 | pages=xv |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0415021375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural anthropology is more related to [[philosophy]], literature and [[the arts]] (how one's culture affects the experience for self and group, contributing to a more complete understanding of the people's knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to [[sociology]] and history.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994pxv"/&gt; In that, it helps develop an understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.

Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by [[cultural relativism]], the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Introduction to culture | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold | year=1994 | page=331 |isbn=0415021375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison.&lt;ref name="Ingold1996p18"&gt;{{cite book | title=Key Debates In Anthropology | author=[[Tim Ingold]] | year=1996|  page=18|quote=the traditional anthropological project of cross-cultural or cross-societal comparison}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is often accommodated in the field of [[ethnography]]. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic [[monograph]]. As a methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. [[Participant observation]] is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernard |first=H. Russell |year=2002 |url=http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |title=Research Methods in Anthropology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104002847/http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |archive-date=4 November 2016 |publisher=[[Altamira Press]] |page=322 |isbn=0759108684 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethnology]] involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an [[emic]] (conceptual, vs. [[etic]], or technical) point of view.

The study of [[kinship]] and [[social organization]] is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a [[human universal]]. Sociocultural anthropology also covers [[Economic anthropology|economic]] and [[Political anthropology|political organization]], law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).

Comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology, including the industrialized (and de-industrialized) West.

===Biological===
{{main|Biological anthropology}}
[[File:Human remains.jpg|thumb|left|Forensic anthropologists can help identify skeletonized human remains, such as these found lying in scrub in Western Australia, c. 1900–1910.]]

Biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions. It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[University of Toronto]] |title=Research Subfields: Physical or Biological |access-date=14 March 2012 |url=http://anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422203737/http://www.anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Archaeological===
{{main|Archaeology}}

[[Archaeology]] is the study of the human past through its material remains. Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies. Archaeologists examine this material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices. Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remain of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, R. H. &amp; Larkin, S. N. (2007). Cultural Anthropology: A problem based approach. Toronto, ON: Nelson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rosetta Stone.svg|thumb|The Rosetta Stone was an example of ancient communication.]]

===Linguistic===
{{main|Linguistic anthropology}}
[[Linguistic anthropology]] (not to be confused with [[anthropological linguistics]]) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2150|title=What is Anthropology? - Advance Your Career|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Salzmann, Zdeněk. (1993) ''Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key topics by field: sociocultural ==

===Art, media, music, dance and film===
{{Anthropology of art}}

==== Art ====
{{main|Anthropology of art}}

One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert. (1981) ''The Anthropology of Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' ''Primitive Art'', Claude Lévi-Strauss' ''The Way of the Masks'' (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.

==== Media ====
{{main|Media anthropology}}
[[File:Punu mask Gabon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Punu tribe mask, Gabon, Central Africa]]
Media anthropology (also known as the anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media. Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movement]]s, or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]], and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spitulnik, Deborah |title=Anthropology and Mass Media|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=22|page=293|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.22.100193.001453|url=http://www.philbu.net/media-anthropology/Spitulnik_MediaAnthro.pdf|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abu-Lughod, Lila |year=1997|title=The Interpretation of Cultures after Television|journal=Representations|volume= 59|pages= 109–133|url=https://direitosehumanos.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/a-interpretac3a7c3a3o-das-culturas-depois-da-televisc3a3o.pdf|jstor=2928817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Music ====
{{main|Ethnomusicology}}
Ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.

==== Visual ====
{{main|Visual anthropology}}
Visual anthropology is concerned, in part, with the study and production of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, [[new media]]. While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with [[ethnographic film]], visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and [[reception theory|reception]] of [[anthropology of media|mass media]]. Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings, and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.

=== Economic, political economic, applied and development ===
{{Economic anthropology}}

==== Economic ====
{{main|Economic anthropology}}
Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of anthropology, [[Bronisław Malinowski]], and his French compatriot, [[Marcel Mauss]], on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]]) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hann|first=Chris|title=Economic Anthropology|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=55–71|author2=Hart, Keith |isbn=9780745644820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the [[global financial system]] from an anthropological perspective.

====Political economy====
{{main|Political economy in anthropology}}
Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. Sahlin's work on hunter-gatherers as the "original affluent society" did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist [[world-system]].&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

==== Applied ====
{{main|Applied anthropology}}
Applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a "complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|isbn=0275978419|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to [[development anthropology]] (distinct from the more critical [[anthropology of development]]).

====Development====
{{main|anthropology of development}}
Anthropology of development tends to view development from a ''critical'' perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short, why does so much planned development fail?

===Kinship, feminism, gender and sexuality===
{{Anthropology of kinship}}

==== Kinship ====
{{main|Kinship}}
''Kinship'' can refer both to ''the study of'' the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to ''the patterns of social relationships'' themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as "[[kinship|descent]]", "[[descent group]]s", "[[lineage (anthropology)|lineages]]", "[[affinity (law)|affines]]", "[[cognatic kinship|cognates]]", and even "[[fictive kinship]]". Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one's social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage.

==== Feminist ====
{{main|Feminist anthropology}}
Feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ([[archaeology|archeological]], [[biological anthropology|biological]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]]. Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies. Feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as a specialization. 

The first [[African-American]] female [[anthropologist]] and [[Caribbeanist]] is said to be [[Vera Mae Green]] who studied ethnic and family relations in the [[Caribbean]] as well as the United States, and thereby tried to improve the way black life, experiences, and culture were studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1525/aa.1982.84.3.02a00080|title = Vera Mae Green, 1928-1982| journal=American Anthropologist| volume=84| issue=3| pages=633–635|date = September 1982|last1 = Cole|first1 = Johnnetta B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical, nutritional, psychological, cognitive and transpersonal===
{{Medical anthropology}}

==== Medical ====
{{main|Medical anthropology}}

Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies "human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation".&lt;ref name=McElroy1996&gt;{{Cite book |year=1996 |author=McElroy, A |chapter=Medical Anthropology |editor1=D. Levinson |editor2=M. Ember |title=Encyclopedia of Cultural Anthropology |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/ethnomedicine/PDF/Medical%20Anthropologie.pdf |isbn= |ref=harv |access-date=2 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001162708/http://www.univie.ac.at/ethnomedicine/PDF/Medical%20Anthropologie.pdf |archive-date=1 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that William Caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology. Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole. It focuses on the following six basic fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Dave|date=2016-10-24|title=Anthropology's Contribution to Public Health Policy Development|journal=McGill Journal of Medicine : MJM|volume=13|issue=1|page=76|issn=1201-026X|pmc=3277334|pmid=22363184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care
* the patient-physician relationship
* the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments
* the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole
* the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations ("critical ethnopsychiatry": Beneduce 2004, 2007)
* the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as ''cultural psychiatry'' and ''transcultural psychiatry'' or ''ethnopsychiatry''.

==== Nutritional ====
{{main|Nutritional anthropology}}

Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.

==== Psychological ====
{{main|Psychological anthropology}}
Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of [[cultural anthropology|cultural]] and [[psychology|mental processes]]. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and [[enculturation]] within a particular cultural group—with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories—shape processes of human [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[perception]], [[motivation]], and [[mental health]]. It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.&lt;ref name="D'Andrade"&gt;{{cite book | last=D'Andrade | first=R. | chapter=The Sad Story of Anthropology: 1950–1999 | editor-first=E.

==== Cognitive ====
{{main|Cognitive anthropology}}
Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.&lt;ref name="D'Andrade"/&gt;

==== Transpersonal ====
{{main|Transpersonal anthropology}}
Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and culture. As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Young | first1=David E. | first2=J.G. | last2=Goulet | date=1994 | title=Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences | publisher=Peterborough: Broadview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and legal===
{{Political anthropology}}

==== Political ====
{{main|Political anthropology}}
Political anthropology concerns the structure of [[Form of government|political systems]], looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more "complex" social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. Firstly, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Secondly, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz' comparative work on "Negara", the Balinese state, is an early, famous example.

====Legal====
{{main|Legal anthropology}}
Legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Greenhouse, Carol J. | title = Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |isbn=0801419719| location = Ithaca | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. More recent applications include issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world|year=2006|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|editor1=Hent de Vries |editor2=Lawrence E. Sullivan }}&lt;/ref&gt; and political uprisings.

====Public====
{{main|Public anthropology}}
Public anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to "demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicanthropology.org Borofsky 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature, science and technology ===
{{Cyber anthropology}}

====Cyborg====
{{main|Cyborg anthropology}}
Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s annual meeting in 1993. The sub-group was very closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie (2001). "Cyborg Anthropology". in ''Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0415920922}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donna Haraway]]'s 1985 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto]]'' could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.

==== Digital ====
{{main|Digital anthropology}}
Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and [[technology]] intersect. It is sometimes grouped with [[cultural anthropology|sociocultural anthropology]], and sometimes considered part of [[material culture]].  The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases. These include techno-anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.studyguide.aau.dk/programmes/postgraduate/53203/ | title=Techno-Anthropology course guide | publisher=Aalborg University | accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital ethnography, cyberanthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://xirdalium.net/category/anthropology/cyberanthropology/ | title=Cyberanthropology | publisher=Peter Hammer Verlag Gmbh | date=August 2011 | accessdate=14 March 2013 | author=Knorr, Alexander | isbn=978-3-7795-0359-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virtual anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Virtual Anthropology: A guide to a new interdisciplinary field | publisher=Springer |author1=Weber, Gerhard |author2=Bookstein, Fred | year=2011 | isbn=978-3-211-48647-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ecological ====
{{main|Ecological anthropology}}
Ecological anthropology is defined as the "study of [[cultural adaptation]]s to environments".&lt;ref name="Kottak"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kottak|first=Conrad Phillip|title=Anthropology : appreciating human diversity|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811699-5|pages=579–584|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field is also defined as, "the study of relationships between a population of humans and their [[biophysical environment]]".&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Patricia K.|title=Environmental anthropology : from pigs to policies|year=2009|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Ill.|isbn=978-1-57766-581-6|page=104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of its research concerns "how cultural [[beliefs]] and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how their environment across space and time.&lt;ref name="Kottak CP 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kottak|first1=Conrad P.|jstor=683339|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|page=23|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227632647}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is [[political ecology]]. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, century anthropology and more.&lt;ref name="Pyke G 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyke|first1=G H|title=Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=15|page=523|year=1984|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243636746}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.&lt;ref name="Checker M 2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Checker|title=Polluted promises: environmental racism and the search for justice in a southern town|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GCcgMi40WkC|date=August 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
{{main|Ethnohistory}} {{see also|Historical anthropology}}
Ethnohistory is the study of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] cultures and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] customs by examining [[History|historical records]]. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not exist today. Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and place names.&lt;ref name="Axtell1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint |  journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi = 10.2307/481465 | jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Anthropology of religion}}
{{main|Anthropology of religion}}
The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between [[magical thinking]] and religion,&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"&gt;[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''An Essay On Man''], pt.II, ch.7 ''Myth and Religion'', pp.&amp;nbsp;122–3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|"It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.]&amp;nbsp;... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion."&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"/&gt;}} and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human [[community]] that worships it.&lt;ref name="Guthrie2000p225"&gt;Guthrie (2000) ''Guide to the Study of Religion''. Bloomsbury Academic. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wlNJQoZlGC4C&amp;pg=PA225 pp.&amp;nbsp;225–6]. {{ISBN|0304701769}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban ===
{{main|Urban anthropology}}
Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of [[urbanization]], poverty, and [[neoliberalism]]. [[Ulf Hannerz]] quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were "a notoriously [[agoraphobic]] lot, anti-urban by definition". Various social processes in the [[Western World]] as well as in the "[[Third World]]" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of "[[Anthropology#Focus on the "other cultures"|specialists in 'other cultures']]" closer to their homes.&lt;ref name=Hannerz/&gt; There are two main approaches to urban anthropology: examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1466138110370412 |jstor=24047982|title=Chinese consumers: The Romantic reappraisal|journal=Ethnography|volume=11|issue=3|page=331|year=2010|last1=Griffiths|first1=M.

== Key topics by field: archaeological and biological ==
{{main|Archaeological|Biological anthropology}}

=== Anthrozoology ===
{{main|Anthrozoology}}
[[Anthrozoology]] (also known as "human–animal studies") is the study of interaction between living things. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, [[ethology]], medicine, [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]].  A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 "Anthrozoology"], ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''. CABI, pp. 28–30. {{ISBN|0851997244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Margo (2010).

=== Biocultural ===
{{main|Biocultural anthropology}}
Biocultural anthropology is the [[scientific]] exploration of the relationships between [[human biology]] and culture. [[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] perspective; that is, from the assumption that [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] human biological differences lead to cultural differences.&lt;ref name=Biocult_syn&gt;{{cite book |last= Goodman |first=Alan H. |author2= Thomas L. Leatherman (eds.) |title=Building A New Biocultural Synthesis |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year= 1998 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T8ZhpG_B_6MC |isbn= 978-0-472-06606-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology.

=== Evolutionary ===
{{main|Evolutionary anthropology}}
Evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominins]] and non-hominin [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]], combining the [[Human development (biology)|human development]] with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as [[archaeology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], [[primatology]], and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

=== Forensic ===
{{main|Forensic anthropology}}
Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of [[physical anthropology]] and human [[osteology]] in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victim's remains are in the advanced stages of [[decomposition]]. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable. The adjective "forensic" refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.

=== Palaeoanthropology ===
{{main|Palaeoanthropology}}
Paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of [[paleontology]] and [[physical anthropology]]. It is the study of ancient humans, as found in [[fossil]] [[Hominidae|hominid]] evidence such as [[Petrifaction|petrifacted]] bones and footprints.

== Organizations ==
Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of anthropologists is the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA), which was founded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/ AAAnet.org]. AAAnet.org. Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Its members are anthropologists from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100613021448/http://aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the [[European Association of Social Anthropologists]] (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe. The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.

Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[anatomy]], [[music theory]], [[art history]], [[sociology]] and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald and Wong, Kate (2007).

==Ethics==
As the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves, and professional societies have generated codes of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report of the Commission to Review the AAA Statements on Ethics - Participate &amp; Advocate|url=http://www.americananthro.org/ParticipateAndAdvocate/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1911&amp;RDtoken=3371&amp;userID=6944|publisher=American Anthropological Association|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.&lt;ref name = "pbuteh"&gt;Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) ''Anthropology &amp; the Colonial Encounter.'' Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) ''Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania''. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have contended:
* That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derives some of its key notions from it, consciously or not. (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).&lt;ref name=Gellner&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) [http://okhovvat.com/files/en/content/2011/6/4/351_379.pdf ''Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion'']. London/New York: Routledge. pp. 26–29. {{ISBN|041508024X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That ethnographic work is often [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]], writing about people as if they were "out of time" in an "ethnographic present" (Johannes Fabian, ''Time and Its Other'').

=== Cultural relativism ===
As part of their quest for [[scientific objectivity]], present-day anthropologists typically urge [[cultural relativism]], which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"/&gt; This is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another's values or viewpoints, but be examined dispassionately on their own terms. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Strauss, Claude (1962). ''The Savage Mind''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Womack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human.''.{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], [[racism]], [[mutilation]] (including [[circumcision]] and [[subincision]]), and [[torture]]. Topics like racism, slavery, and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin. ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; to genes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&amp;sectioncode=26 Is there a gene for racism? | Times Higher Education (THE)]. Times Higher Education (2016-10-27). Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[acculturation]] have been proposed, not to mention theories of [[colonialism]] and many others as root causes of [[Man's inhumanity to man]]. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as "racism" and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on "Race"|url=http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm|publisher=American Anthropological Association|date=May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.282.5389.654 |pmid=9841421 |title=CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY:DNA Studies Challenge the Meaning of Race |journal=Science |volume=282 |issue=5389 |pages=654–5 |year=1998 |last1=Marshall |first1=E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Allan (1995).

Ortiz|url=https://www.academia.edu/199944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military involvement===
Anthropologists' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the [[Axis Powers]] (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, [[David Price (anthropologist)|David H. Price]]'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little. Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement.  Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The [[Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth]] (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that "in relation with their own government and with host governments&amp;nbsp;... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army's strategy in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm US Army's strategy in Afghanistan: better anthropology]. CSMonitor.com (2007-09-07). Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' reports that "Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs" [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]], under the ''[[Human Terrain System]]'' (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the [[US military in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century |url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121225645/http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archivedate=21 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the American Anthropological Association's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology. In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of "anthropology" within DoD."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.aaanet.org/2009/12/08/aaa-commission-releases-final-report-on-army-human-terrain-system/ "AAA Commission Releases Final Report on Army Human Terrain System"].

==Post–World War II developments==
Before WWII British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

===Basic trends===
There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[Holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79"/&gt; The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.

In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato (1993).  ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. Inda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xavier, John and Rosaldo, Renato (2007).  ''The Anthropology of Globalization''.

Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation&lt;ref&gt;Jurmain, Robert; Kilgore, Lynn; Trevathan, Wenda and Ciochon, Russell L. (2007).  ''Introduction to Physical Anthropology''. 11th Edition. Wadsworth. chapters I, III and IV. {{ISBN|0495187798}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wompack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human''. Prentice Hall. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–20. {{ISBN|0136440711}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald (1991).  ''Human Universals''. McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughley, Neil (2000).  ''Being Humans: Anthropological Universality and Particularity in Transciplinary Perspectives''. Walter de Gruyter Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  They use many different methods of study, but modern population [[genetics]], [[participant observation]] and other techniques often take anthropologists "into the field," which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called "fieldwork."  On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.

Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of [[comparative method]], a central part of their science.

===Commonalities between fields===
Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see [[History of anthropology]]), including but not limited to [[Fossil collecting|fossil-hunting]], [[Exploration|exploring]], documentary film-making, [[paleontology]], [[primatology]], antiquity dealings and curatorship, [[philology]], [[etymology]], [[genetics]], regional analysis, [[ethnology]], history, [[philosophy]], and [[religious studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D. Murphy (2003). ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. Broadview Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12. {{ISBN|1442601108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George (1992) "Paradigmatic Traditions in the History of Anthropology", pp. 342–361 in George Stocking, ''The Ethnographer's Magic and Other Essays in the History of Anthropology''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0299134148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, Murray (1979). ''Man, Mind and Science: A History of Anthropology.'' Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of "other cultures", both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).&lt;ref&gt;See the many essays relating to this in Prem Poddar and David Johnson, Historical Companion to Postcolonial Thought in English, Edinburgh University Press, 2004. See also Prem Poddar et al., Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures—Continental Europe and its Empires, Edinburgh University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the classic of [[urban anthropology]], [[Ulf Hannerz]] in the introduction to his seminal ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'' mentions that the "[[Third World]]" had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in "other cultures" looked for them far away and started to look "across the tracks" only in late 1960s.&lt;ref name=Hannerz&gt;[[Ulf Hannerz|Hannerz, Ulf]] (1980) ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'', {{ISBN|0-231-08376-9}}, p. 1. ISBN Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's "home".&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/682051 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences]'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' "100:" 716–731&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and [[Sociology]], on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody|Goody, Jack]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC The Theft of History]''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-87069-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to [[sociologist]]s, but this is increasingly changing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Abélès | first1 = Marc | year = | title = How the Anthropology of France Has Changed Anthropology in France: Assessing New Directions in the Field |journal = [[Cultural Anthropology (journal)|Cultural Anthropology]] | volume = 1999 | issue = | page = 407 | jstor = 08867356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like ''[[Terrain (journal)|Terrain]]'' ("fieldwork"), and developing with the center founded by [[Marc Augé]] (''[[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains]]'', the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).

Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale. There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Michael M. J. (2003) ''Emergent Forms of Life and the Anthropological Voice''. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archaeo-optics''', or '''archaeological optics''', is the study of the experience and ritual use of light by ancient peoples. Archaeological [[optics]] is a branch of sensory archaeology, which explores human perceptions of the physical environment in the remote past, and is a sibling of [[archaeoastronomy]], which deals with ancient observations of celestial bodies, and archaeological acoustics, which deals with applications of sound.

Research by several investigators around the world has uncovered how ancient peoples encountered and used the [[camera obscura]] principle for a variety of purposes. In a darkened chamber, light passing through a small opening can create haunting and ephemeral moving images, which could have triggered and reinforced ground breaking modes of thought, forms of representation, and belief in otherworldly realms.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2009). “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura.” In Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Assimina Kaniari and Marina Wallace, eds.) London: Zidane. 153.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optical basis==

=== Light ===
Visible [[light]], a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, encompasses wavelengths between 380-750 nanometers, which humans perceive as the colors of the spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Light behaves according to a well-defined set of rules: it travels in straight lines, unless otherwise refracted or reflected by another object, or curved by gravity.

=== Vision ===
An [[eye]] is essentially a darkened chamber with a small hole in front that allows light to enter. The lens, just behind the pupil’s aperture, is perfectly clear but appears black because the interior space behind it is dark. Rays of light pass through the lens, producing an upside-down image on the retina.&lt;ref&gt;Explanation of camera obscura operations derived from Pollack, P. (1969). The Picture History of Photography: From the Earliest Beginnings to the Present Day. New York: Harry N. Abrams. 18.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The brain reorients the image. This optical process of projecting an inverted image is known as a [[camera obscura]] (from the Latin, meaning dark room). The first pinhole/camera obscura eyes evolved about 540 million years ago on a sea mollusk, known as a [[Nautilus#Senses|nautilus]], during the Cambrian period. The camera obscura principle is primordial, and life on earth has evolved to take advantage of it.

=== Camera obscura ===
The camera obscura principle is not limited to eyes, or even lenses, but works with a small hole, or aperture, and any darkened space of whatever size or shape. In modern times, camera obscuras have been fashioned from shoeboxes, oatmeal boxes, soda cans, cookie containers, seashells, eggshells, refrigerators, tents, trucks, airplane hangars, and even hollowed out forms of snow and dirt. A camera obscura can also be produced by a small hole in a roof, wall, or window-shutter through which the view of the outside is projected onto a wall inside a darkened room.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, H. and Gernsheim, A. (1969). The History of Photography: From the Camera Obscura to the Beginning of the Modern Era. New York: McGraw-Hill. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologist Donald Perry went on an expedition into the rain forest of Costa Rica where he climbed into the cavity of a large hollow tree, and discovered a small hole that projected an upside-down image of the outside world onto the opposite interior wall of the trunk.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, D. (1988). Life above the Jungle Floor. New York: Simon and Schuster. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  This sort of experience is available across time.&lt;ref&gt;Renner, E. (2004). Pinhole Photography: Rediscovering a Historic Technique (3rd ed). Oxford: Focal Press. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The image created appears like an upside-down movie. A camera obscura relies on the contrast between the bright exterior world and a dim interior space, so that a greater contrast produces a more obvious projected image. Absolute darkness in the interior is not necessary, but there must be a significant difference between the two illumination levels.

==Archaeological basis==

=== Architecture ===
The archaeological record is replete with excavations of built structures across time, but due to the natural decay of materials and the vagaries of preservation, the further backward in time, the less likely it is for artifacts to have survived. For example, [[Paleolithic]] shelter constructions from the Lower Paleolithic (c. 2,600,000 - 300,000 BP) and Middle Paleolithic (c. 300,000 - 45,000 BP) are generally less complete and thus subject to interpretation, while those dating to the Upper Paleolithic (c. 45,000- 10,000 BP) are both more numerous and better preserved. Paleolithic structures generally have no remaining superstructure, and must be inferred from a footprint of artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;For a good overview of Palaeolithic dwellings structures and strategies see Cattelain, P. and Hauzeur, A. (1998). “Des premiers abris aux premières maisons.” In Les grandes inventions de la Préhistoire (Bellier C. and Cattelain, P. eds.) (Guides archéologiques du Malgré-Tout) Treignes: CEDARC. 37-46; and De Beaune, S. (2012). “Aux origins de la construction.” In Édifice et Artifice (R. Carvais, A. Guillerme, V. Nègre, J. Sakarovitch, eds.) Premier Congrès francophone d’histoire de la construction Paris, 2008  Paris: Piccard. 77-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, some [[Neolithic]] structures retain above ground elements. The Neolithic saw the rise of agriculture and the establishment of settlements, which produced a surplus of foodstuffs and an increase in population density. A large, coordinated labor force enabled the process of hauling enormous stones to build large, permanent structures. By about 5000 BP, many groups of people over a widespread area were erecting large timbers and stones, or megaliths, to enclose communal spaces. Into historical times, the development of writing offered another layer of information, with descriptions of the physical appearance, materials, design, use, and events related to structures. This combination of remnants and records enhances the accuracy of archaeo-optical analysis.

=== Archaeological optics and archaeoastronomy ===
There is some evidence that prehistorical structures oriented upon the sun's position on the horizon also created camera obscura situations. Examples in Western Europe include midwinter sunrise at [[Newgrange]],&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange. Archaeology, Art and Legend. London, Thames and Hudson. 117, 123-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  midwinter sunset at [[Maeshowe]],&lt;ref&gt;MacKie, E.W. (1997). “Maeshowe and the Winter Solstice: ceremonial aspects of the Orkney Grooved Ware culture.” Antiquity 71. 338-59.&lt;/ref&gt;  and midsummer sunrise at [[Bryn Celli Ddu]].&lt;ref&gt;Burrow, S. (2010). “Bryn Celli Ddu Passage Tomb, Anglesey: Alignment, Construction, Date and Ritual.” In Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 76. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

While archaeoastronomical studies have traditionally discussed these kinds of monument as observatories, fieldwork conducted in the 1990s at [[Clava cairn|Balnuaran]] of Clava by Ronnie Scott and Tim Phillips suggests the midwinter sunset would have cast images inside two [[Passage Tombs|passage tombs]]. By temporarily reconstructing the collapsed roofs of these monuments, they noted that the act of viewing the sun along their passageways was not only potentially blinding but could only be clearly viewed by one person at a time. In contrast, an audience of over twenty people could stand with their backs to the opening to observe the effects of sunlight falling upon deliberately patterned stonework built into walls of both chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1999). “Clava: Light at the End of the Tunnel.” Current Archaeology 165. 332-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  These observations inspired Scott to speculate that these structures were camera obscuras, and that an optical projection of the sun’s disc would reproduce the movements of the sun through the sky for many people to see at once.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1998). “Archaeological experiment at Balnuaran of Clava North Eastern cairn on 20th and 22nd December 1997.” In Sites and Monuments Archive: &lt;http://her.highland.gov.uk/hbsmrgatewayhighland/DataFiles/LibraryLinkFiles/37677.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeological optics and the archaeology of the senses ===
Archaeological optics contributes to a wider discipline, the archaeology of the senses. Rather than just recording the remains of the past such as standing stones or built walls, this wider discipline emphasizes how the spaces in-between these features could have been arenas for sensory experiences, even if parts of the original structures have disappeared. Among the senses, vision has been a major consideration, including studies of visibility between sites,&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, A.B.  and Woodwood, P.J. (1996). “The topography of some barrow cemeteries in Bronze Age Wessex.” In Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 62. 275-91.&lt;/ref&gt;  interactions with geology and topography,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, R. (1998). Ruined buildings, ruined stones: enclosures, tombs and natural places in the Neolithic of south-west England. World Archaeology 30. 13-22.&lt;/ref&gt; archaeoastronomical alignment,&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, C. (1999). Astronomy in Prehistoric Britain and Ireland. London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  or color symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. and MacGregor, G., eds. (2002). Colouring the past: the significance of colour in archaeological research. London: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, anthropology has revealed societies that emphasize the other senses&lt;ref&gt;Howes, D. and Classen, C., eds. (1991). The varieties of sensory experience. London: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;  including qualities such as scent and smell.&lt;ref&gt;Classen, C., Howes, D., and Synnott, A. (1994). Aroma: the cultural history of smell. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  The social significance of the sensory of food and drink,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilakis, Y. (1999). “Food technologies/technologies of the body: the social context of wine and oil production and consumption in Bronze Age Crete.” In World Archaeology 31(1). 38-54.&lt;/ref&gt;  and touch and texture&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, V. (2002). “Experiencing texture and transformation in the British Neolithic.”In Oxford Journal of Archaeology 21(3). 249-61.&lt;/ref&gt;  can also be considered.

Other studies have examined archaeomusicology and archaeoacoustics.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, C and Lawson, G., eds. (2006). Archaeoacoustics. Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.&lt;/ref&gt;  Palaeolithic bone artifacts have been interpreted as musical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;Megaw, J.V.S.

(1988). “La dimension sonore des grottes ornées.” In Bulletin de la Société Préhistorique Française 85. 238-46.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s the sonic properties of built architecture came under increasing scrutiny with investigations into vocally induced resonances inside chambered Neolithic sites,&lt;ref&gt;Devereux, P. and Jahn, R (1996). “Preliminary investigations and cognitive considerations of the acoustical resonances of selected archaeological sites.” In Antiquity 70. 665-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as the wider acoustic phenomenon within a variety of megalithic structures.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Keating. D. (1999). “Architecture and sound: an acoustic analysis of megalithic monuments in prehistoric Britain.” In Antiquity 73. 325-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

An archaeology of the senses, including archaeological optics, emphasizes that the past was inhabited by living people whose experiences were inherently partial and subjective. Indeed, this subjectivity might have lent both meaning and mystery to events occurring within ancient structures. This acknowledges that the senses were likely to have been used and understood in very different ways by people through time.

==Development of the field of archaeological optics==

The study of ancient perceptions of light developed from many disparate sources — archaeologists, artists, antiquarians, and astronomers  — with precursors reaching back at least a millennium. In 1998, archaeologist Ronnie Scott speculated that Neolithic [[Passage grave|passage tombs]] in Scotland might have been used as camera obscuras.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1998). “Archaeological experiment at Balnuaran of Clava North Eastern cairn on 20th and 22nd December 1997.” In Sites and Monuments Archive: &lt;http://her.highland.gov.uk/hbsmrgatewayhighland/DataFiles/LibraryLinkFiles/37677.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, Robert Temple published an investigation into [[Nimrud lens|crystal lenses]] that date to antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Temple, R. (2000). The Crystal Sun: The Most Secret Science of the Ancient World. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeo-optics, as yet unnamed, arose as a formal line of inquiry beginning in 2005, with a presentation by Matt Gatton and his colleagues of “The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art” at the University of Louisville, Kentucky. They made subsequent presentations at the University of Lisbon in 2006, and Archaeology Institute at Oxford University in 2007. A small number of researchers independently began to undertake archaeological optics fieldwork at Neolithic passage tombs. In 2011, Morgan Saletta published a paper noting camera obscura projections at two sites in the south of France.&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M. (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 364-73.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2011, Gatton began documenting optical projections at sites in Denmark. Aaron Watson, in collaboration with Ronnie Scott, began to record the archaeo-optic properties of monuments in Scotland in 2012, and Wales in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In Papadopoulos. C. and Moyes, H., eds., The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, the concept of archaeological optics as a broader academic field has coalesced with Constantinos Papadopoulos and Holley Moyes’s planning of the Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology, which brought researchers working along similar lines into contact.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In Papadopoulos.

==Palaeolithic archaeological optics==

=== Paleolithic structures ===
The Lower Paleolithic was a time of early humans such as [[Homo habilis]] and [[Homo erectus]]. Possible indications of the early development of shelter construction during the Lower Paleolithic come from excavations at [[Olduvai Gorge]],&lt;ref&gt;Leakey, M.D. (1971).

====Taphonomy====

The actual physical evidence of Paleolithic shelters is limited to permanent materials like stone and bone. No wooden post or animal hide has been found, because these materials disintegrate over the course of time. But the existence of the perishable elements can be established. Postholes prove the existence of the wooden supports. The alignment of the holes or a circle of support stones describes a footprint of a framework. The area covered by flint scattered from blade work, and other household activities, further demarcates the interior shape of the structure.

The types of stones, bones, and minerals found at the campsites further describe the use of animal hides as tent covering. Butchered and burned animal bones found around the fire pit show which types of animals were hunted and eaten. Stone tools such as hide scrapers and deposits of minerals employed in preparing skins show the routine use of animal hides. In addition, there are a host of ethnographic parallels, as indigenous cultures throughout the world relied on animal hides as a shelter covering material until the onset of the modern era.

====Lifeways====
The people of the Paleolithic existed prior to agriculture and the domestication of animals, and they would have lived as small bands of [[hunter-gatherers]], moving from place to place, exploiting plant, animal, and mineral resources. Two of the factors that influenced choice of location were proximity to fresh water and animal migration routes.&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, P.G. (1985). Pyrenean Prehistory: A Palaeoeconomic Survey of the French Sites. Warminster: Aris &amp; Phillips. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;  Paleolithic foragers would also set up camp overlooking fields inhabited by herds of hoofed herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, D. (1987). The Field Guide to Early Man. New York: Diagram Group. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleolithic campsites were characterized by repeated, seasonal, short-term occupation. While the inhabitants were quite mobile, without beasts of burden, shelters were not transported. A tent might stand at its location for a few years before it deteriorated and had to be rebuilt. The archaeological record describes shelters rebuilt over-and-over on roughly the same spot. Bands of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers followed an annual circuit with shelters built at strategic points along the way.

====Hearths====
Paleolithic campsites were dotted with external fire pits and internal hearths. The internal hearths were not open-burning fires, but were hollow areas that held heated stones and charcoal.&lt;ref&gt;Leesch, D. and Bullinger, J. (2012). “Identifying dwellings in Upper Palaeolithic open-air sites: The Magdalenian site at Monruz (Switzerland) and its contribution to analysing palimpsest.” In A Mind Set on Flint: Studies in Honour of Dick Stapert (Niekus, M., Barton, N., Street, M., Terberger, T., eds.)

Hot stones and charcoals would be rolled, with sticks or bones, onto a thick animal hide and conveyed a couple of meters from the fire pit to the hearth. The next day the task would be repeated: hearths were taken apart and reassembled routinely. Frequent heating caused the rocks to discolor and crumble. Once a rock was no longer effective at holding heat, it was thrown in a nearby refuse pit along with animal bones and other household waste. An internal stone hearth is an effective strategy for staying warm, but it did not provide any light.&lt;ref&gt;Leesch, D., and Bullinger, J.

Groningen Archaeological Studies, Vol. 16. Groningen: Barkhuis. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;  The interiors of the tents were then dim places, where ancient people would have witnessed the camera obscura effect.

=== Paleolithic archaeological optics ===
Paleolithic archaeological optics involves investigations into the image projection capacities of Paleolithic tent reconstructions.

====Reconstructions====
The suitability of Paleolithic tents/shelters for coincidental camera obscura formation was explored during a set of experiments under the direction of Matt Gatton in 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2005). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The case for image projection in the Palaeolithic, first presented at the University of Louisville.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; October 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first set of experiments took place on a bison ranch in Oldham County, Kentucky, where a small, rudimentary bison hide [[teepee]] was erected next to a pasture, and images of the bison were cast through a hole in the hides and projected into the tent. The second set of experiments occurred at a rock shelter outside of Irvine, Estill County, Kentucky, where the investigators leaned a framework of tree branches against a rock wall and covered it with bison hides. The image of a horse outside was projected through a rough hole in the hides and into the interior space. The third set of experiments took place at the Musée du Malgré-Tout in Belgium, where archaeologists Pierre Cattelain and Claire Bellier reconstructed a variety of Paleolithic structures in several places in France, Germany and Ukraine. A smattering of holes was present in the hide coverings of each tent. At the German site, images were projected inside the reconstruction onto a rabbit hide.

====Statistical analysis====
The tent reconstructions established some plausibility of accidental camera obscura formation during the Paleolithic, but plausibility is not probability, so the question of the probable frequency of projected images was explored by [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] statistical modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2011). “Probability and the Origin of Art: Simulations of the Paleo-camera Theory.” In APLIMAT, Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 4. 181-190 Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2012). “Projecting Projection: A statistical analysis of cast-light images.” In Pleistocene Coalition Newsletter #18.&lt;/ref&gt;

To evaluate the probability of an unknown event a series of conditional probabilities were used to create a chance tree using [https://www.treeage.com/products/ TreeAge Pro 2011] (Williamstown, MA). The conditions affecting the appearance of projected images are the general context of the shelter, aperture existence, aperture size, sunlight exposure, weather, occupancy, and the specific context of the dwelling. Given the different situations regarding variables; the probability of a person observing a projected image inside a Palaeolithic dwelling ranged from 1% to 8% per day, or 4 to 29 times per year.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2011). “Probability and the Origin of Art: Simulations of the Paleo-camera Theory.” In APLIMAT, Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 4. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiplying the yearly occurrences by the range of years and the estimated human population; camera obscura images could have been observed anywhere from 54.8 billion to 4.38 trillion times (5.48x10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; to 4.38x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) over the course of prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2011). “Probability and the Origin of Art: Simulations of the Paleo-camera Theory.” In APLIMAT, Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 4. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implications ===
The likely prevalence of prehistoric camera obscuras throughout the human experience suggests several important implications for the development of art, religious beliefs, philosophy and existing cave art.

====Art====
The origins of art have been a significant mystery, because art, as a form of communication, is largely a social construct. The core issue is that there can be no intention to represent an object or scene without first knowing that such a depiction is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, I. and Noble, W. (1989). “The Archaeology of Perception: Traces of Depiction and Language.” In Current Anthropology 30. 129.	&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have encountered great difficulty coming up with explanations of how prehistoric people first stumbled upon the idea of the possibility of representation.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis-Williams, D. (2002). Mind in the Cave. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2002. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  The archaeo-optical explanation is that images projected inside a dwelling space provided, according to Cambridge professor Nigel Spivey, “… a prototypical visual experience that triggers the concept of representation…”&lt;ref&gt;Personal correspondence, E-mail from Nigel Spivey to Matt Gatton sent on Monday, March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the images would be shared experiences, visible by everyone in the tent or structure at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M., Carreon, L., Cawein, M., Brock, W., and Scott, V. (2010). “The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The case for image projection in the Palaeolithic.” In the Official Proceedings of the XV World Congress of the Union Internationale des Sciences Préhistoriques et Protohistoriques (UISPP) 35, Lisbon 2006, Global State of the Art--SO7 (Kumar, G. and Bednarik, R., eds.) Oxford: Archaeopress. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;  The group could thus collectively experience, discuss, verify, confirm, investigate, and interpret the images projected on the surfaces before them. It is the communal aspect of the images that makes the development of visual art socially feasible.

“A randomly projected image stands for a real object; it says bison without being a flesh and blood bison, planting the idea of a referent, the conceptual beginning of art.” -Matt Gatton&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura” in Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Kaniari, A. and Wallace, M., eds.) London: Zidane. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Faith====
It is also possible that camera obscura images could have fostered religious belief. A broad definition of religion is a belief in an alternative realm that influences physical reality. Theologian Rudolf Otto held that the origins of religion are to be found in the concept of the sacred, the divine presenting itself as something “wholly other” (ganz andere).&lt;ref&gt;Otto, R. (1950 ed.). The idea of the holy; an inquiry into the non-rational factor in the idea of the divine and its relation to the rational [Harvey, J.W., trans.]. New York: Oxford University Press, 1950 ed. Originally published in German as Das Heilige (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;  The images projected in Paleolithic tents would have offered an early gateway to the concept of an alternative realm, a glimpse of an "other", that initiated a belief in something that was not seen moment to moment. The images, once seen, lingered in the mind, and took root in the culture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The camera’s image instantly splits a quasi-reality away from reality, peeling off an ‘other’ from the ‘is’; instilling the very idea that animals, plants, and humans have existences in other forms, spirits, on other planes.” - Matt Gatton&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Paleo-camera and the Concept of Representation." In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 3 (Feliks, J., ed.) May–June. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once the concept of an alternative realm had taken root, it would have provided a domain for agents of an "other" world to intervene in human affairs. The notion of spirit forms is the very root of animism, the oldest known, and perhaps first, form of religion. The incidental image is possibly the first glimpse of the "divine".&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Paleo-camera and the Concept of Representation." In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 3 (Feliks, J., ed.) May–June. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophy====

The core issue of metaphysics is the investigation of the nature of reality. The images in a Paleolithic tent would trigger a cascade of thoughts about the essence of reality: What is ''that'' plane of existence? And reflexively, what is ''this'' plane?&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2009). “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura.” In Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Kaniari, A. and Wallace, M., eds.) London: Zidane. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only by glimpsing an alternative reality does this reality become open to question — the very start of abstract examination.

====Schematicized distortions====
The projections by camera obscura can also explain some common features among cave paintings of animals and people. Paleolithic [[Cave painting|cave art]] is well known for iconic, schematicized figures, usually with extremely small heads and enormous, often bowed, bodies. Examples of the core elements of some Paleolithic cultures’ visual lexicon — repetition, disconnection, movement, superimposition, and distortion — are expressed in engravings on flat stones and bones within the habitation sites and also on the walls of deep caves.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “The Camera and the Cave: Understanding the style of Palaeolithic art.” In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 5 (Feliks, J., ed.) September–October.
Gatton, M. (2010). “Paleo-camera, Phase II: Projected images in art and ritual (or why European Upper Palaeolithic art looks the way it does).” In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 4 (Feliks, J., ed.) July–August.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, Matt Gatton, Walter Brock, and Dylan Brock set up a room-sized camera obscura on a farm in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. The image of a horse was projected on to a small flat stone. It was natural for the artist to catch the image with his torso, the engraving stone secured against the body, and the eyes looking down on the inverted image. In this scenario it was advantageous to tilt the stone slightly. The more the stone was tilted the more the image of the animal distorted, the animal’s head reducing in size and the stomach bowing downward, quite like the distortions seen in some deep cave art.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2009). “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura.” In Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Kaniari, A. and Wallace, M., eds.) London: Zidane. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  This distortion is known as the [[keystone effect]]. Gatton proposed that the deep cave distortions may have resulted from the camera obscura effects within the tents.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2005). “Drawing experiments” in “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The case for image projection in the Palaeolithic, first presented at the University of Louisville.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paleolithic archaeo-optic concepts in wider culture ===

The hypothesis that paleolithic people would have seen camera obscura effects within their shelters—Gatton’s Paleolithic Camera Obscura Theory—has gained wider exposure in the last several years, including specific references in the following venues.

==Neolithic archaeological optics==
The [[Neolithic]] period offers the possibility to explore optical image projections within built architecture. Neolithic structures range from modest houses to enormous enclosures and mounds, and were constructed using combinations of earth, timber and stone. Archaeo-optic fieldwork has focused upon [[megalithic]] monuments.

=== Megalithic structures ===
Megaliths, or large stones, come in two main types of architectural presentations: freestanding and earth-covered. Individual and groupings of standing stones  — in formations of circles, lines, ovals, ‘U’-shapes, or rectangles — were not employed to support the weight of soil above them, but served as markers. Megalithic chambers designed to bear the weight of a mound of earth, turf, rubble or stone have been classified into groups, including [[dolmen]]s, portal dolmens, [[gallery grave]]s, [[Wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tombs]], [[passage tomb]]s, and [[Court cairn|court tombs]]. The term "dolmen" describes groupings of erected stones supporting one large, flat roof stone, like an oversized rudimentary table. "Portal dolmens" have an angled stone slab supported by uprights that define a chamber, often with an entrance. "Gallery" graves are elongated dolmens consisting of two rows of upright stones (orthostats) supporting a series of flat roof stones (lintels). "Wedge" tombs are wider at the mouth, and narrower as they recede inward. "Passage tombs" have a long boulder-built passage that leads to a buried chamber. "Court" tombs are so-named because they have what appears to be a courtyard encircled by standing stones in front of the tomb chamber. Although many of these structures now appear as freestanding monuments, their stones were often the skeletal substructures of mounds removed by erosion or human action.

A major focus for megalithic chambers is in western Europe: Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, and Iberia. Their origin, chronology and purpose is a subject of ongoing research and debate. In fact, they are not limited to Europe, and are found across Eurasia and the entire globe. Their significance in past cultures is suggested by the labor and resources required to create them. The painstakingly and intricately constructed mounds were significant feats, requiring tens of thousands of hours to construct. For example, it has been speculated that a workforce of 400 working continuously for two months every year would have taken around 16 years to construct the 200,000 tonne cairn at Newgrange.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange. Archaeology, Art and Legend. London: Thames and Hudson. 117-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the British Isles and Ireland it is possible that many different kinds of chambered monument, including those constructed from timber, may have been suited to the creation of optical phenomenon. Recent studies have focused upon one format in particular: the megalithic passage tomb.

====Passage tombs====
Passage tombs comprise a single stone-built passageway that gives access to a central chamber, and there may be adjoining chambers or cells. This structure is entirely covered by a mound that might consist of earth, rubble, turf or clay. Their distribution extends across the west of Europe. Determining the exact numbers of these sites is problematic due to the poor preservation of many. There are over one hundred and fifty proven passage tombs in Ireland, with an overall estimate of over three hundred in total,&lt;ref&gt;Eogan, G. (1986). Knowth and the passage tombs of Ireland. London: Thames and Hudson. 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  roughly five hundred in Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;Nualláin, S.Ó. (1979). “The Megalithic Tombs of Ireland” in Expedition 21, no. 3, University of Pennsylvania. 11. See also Møder med Danmarks oldtid (2011) (exhibition). National Museet, Copenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt;  and over 250 in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, A.S. and Ritchie, J.N.G. (2001). The Chambered Cairns of the Central Highlands. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their classification has been further divided into groups such as the Orkney-Cromarty, Maeshowe and Clava traditions, but all retain the same fundamental format. Their construction likely began in the earlier Neolithic soon after 5600 BP&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1991). The Chambered Cairns of Caithness. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 83-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  and extends to around 4000 BP at excavated examples of Clava Cairn passage tombs,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, R. (2000). The Good Stones: A new investigation of the Clava Cairns. Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Monograph 17. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  but this need not imply that they were constructed or used throughout this time.

====Passage tomb Preservation====
The survival of passage tombs is variable and dependent upon many factors. The excavation of two later Neolithic passage graves at Balnuaran of Clava demonstrated that their architecture was inherently unstable and would have likely collapsed within decades of their construction.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley. R. (1998). “Architecture, Imagination and the Neolithic world.” In Creativity in Human Evolution and Prehistory, (Mithen, S., ed.). London: Routledge. 227-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier examples, including the Orkney-Cromarty format, appear to generally have been more robust. Passage tombs could also be reused in later times, including the Iron Age and early Medieval, and their Neolithic content was sometimes removed. Some were destroyed when new structures were built upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Hingley, R. (1996). “Ancestors and identity in the later prehistory of Atlantic Scotland: the reuse and reinvention of Neolithic monuments and material culture.” In World Archaeology 28. 231-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most have required consolidation, reconstruction or strengthening to allow public access. In the Boyne Valley, Newgrange and Knowth have undergone significant excavation and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange. Archaeology, Art and Legend. London, Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eogan, G. (1986). Knowth and the passage tombs of Ireland. London: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;   In Orkney, the roof of the chamber within Maeshowe has been restored following damage caused by Vikings in the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 62-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, recent building work has significantly altered their appearance, a critical factor that has to be taken into account when observing and interpreting optical phenomena within their passages and chambers.

====Conundrum of use====
Passage tombs across Europe have long been a focus for myths and legends. Medieval lore has it that wizards, giants, witches, or demons erected the great stones, and that the mounds were the homes of gnomes, elves, faeries, and goblins.&lt;ref&gt;Burl, A. (1999). Circles of Stone: The Prehistoric Rings of Britain and Ireland. London: Harvill Press. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Denmark, passage graves are still referred to as jættestuer (troll houses). An analysis of Irish folk tales revealed that megalithic mounds both served as the burial places of ancient heroes, and were the abodes of supernatural beings.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange: Archaeology, art and legend. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many passage tombs do indeed contain the remains of the dead—sometimes in significant quantities. For example, excavations at [[Chambered cairn#Maeshowe|Quanterness]] revealed the bones of 157 individuals of various ages, but the total number held within the tomb may have been nearer to 400.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal remains and artifacts are also found at some sites, including beads, stone balls and pottery.

It appears that burial was not the sole function of passage "tombs". Some sites contain little evidence of human remains, although this could reflect their subsequent histories, while others have evidence for activities by the living. Fires were burnt within sites in Orkney&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  and at Knowth, Dowth and Newgrange in Ireland there are examples where images were carved in situ upon stones within their interiors.&lt;ref&gt;Eogan, G. (1986). Knowth and the passage tombs of Ireland. London: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. (2004). “By Way of Illustration: Art, Memory and Materiality in the Irish Sea and Beyond.” In The Neolithic of the Irish Sea: Materiality and Traditions of Practice, (Cummings, V. and Fowler, C., eds.) Oxford: Oxbow. 202-13.&lt;/ref&gt;    The passages at a number of sites align with sunrise or sunset at pivotal times of the year causing their otherwise darkened chambers to be illuminated. Many demonstrate extraordinary acoustic properties. Together, these factors suggest that passage tombs might be interpreted as venues for diverse activities that involved both the living and the dead.

=== The use of passage tombs as camera obscuras ===
The principal fieldwork exploring the optical properties of passage tombs has been conducted by Matt Gatton in Denmark, Morgan Saletta in France, Aaron Watson in Wales, Aaron Watson and Ronnie Scott in Scotland, and Eva Bosch in Spain.

====Format====
The format of passage tombs is uniquely suited to the creation and control of optical projections. These structures reproduce the fundamental format of a camera obscura&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of Life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  and fieldwork has demonstrated that they can indeed have remarkable projection capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H. eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The chamber offers a dark space while the single passageway enables the movement of light to be closely controlled. In some cases their basic configuration alone is sufficient to cast a projection,&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M. (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 370-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  and a small number offer mechanisms through which light can be closely controlled. For example, the roof-box at Newgrange has evidence for the repeated relocation of quartz blocks that could have been used to manipulate optical projections.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange: Archaeology, art and legend. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the majority of cases, however, additional apertures were required.

====Restricted access====
The entrances at many passage tombs appear to have been temporarily sealed in a variety of ways: boulders, slabs, blocks, planks or wooden frameworks, as evidenced by postholes by the entrance. Maeshowe has a recess near to the passage entrance that holds a carefully balanced portal stone that can be pivoted into place.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 51.
&lt;/ref&gt;  This leaves a narrow gap between the top of this block and the passage lintels, thereby allowing light to enter even when the passageway is impassable to people.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, C. (1999). Astronomy in Prehistoric Britain and Ireland. London: Yale University Press. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the roof box at Newgrange is situated above the passageway, as is a comparable feature within Cairn G at Carrowkeel. These apertures could be operated independently to the passages. Even in the absence of such devices only minor additions - stone blocks, a hole in a wooden plank, or an animal hide hung between posts at the entrance - are required to convert the monument into an operational camera obscura. The passage serves as a conduit for light and the rear of the chamber acts as a projection surface.

====Aperture plane====
The character of optical projections within passage tombs is determined by a number of interconnected factors. Lighting inside the monument needs to be low but total darkness is not always required, depending on the relative brightness outside.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Palaeo-camera and the Concept of Representation.” In Pleistocene Coalition News 2 (3). 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M., Carreon, L., Cawein, M., Brock, W. and Scott, V. (2010). “The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The Case for Image Projection in the Palaeolithic.” In Proceedings of the XV World Congress of the Union Internationale des Sciences Préhistoriques et Protohistoriques (UISPP) 35, Global State of the Art (SO7), BAR S2108, (Kumar, G. and Bednarik, R., eds.) 135-41. Oxford: Archaeopress.&lt;/ref&gt;    Observations at the Grey Cairns of Camster by Aaron Watson and Ronnie Scott showed that it was possible to cast projections in fog, rain and under heavy cloud, but that such conditions significantly impaired their clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2016). “Archaeo-optics and image projection in the Neolithic.” In &lt;www.monumental.uk.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The size and brightness of projections can be adjusted both by modifying the size of the aperture and moving the aperture plane itself in relation to the focal plane, which is frequently the wall of the chamber aligned with the passageway. Increasing the focal distance by moving the aperture along the passage increases the size of the projection but also reduces its brightness. Reducing the aperture diameter results in a more focused, but increasingly dark, image. A further contributing factor is the texture of the surface upon which the image is projected. For example, observations by Aaron Watson have revealed that the slab that constitutes the back wall of the chamber at Bryn Celli Ddu is smooth enough to carry a detailed image.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2016). “Archaeo-optics and image projection in the Neolithic.” In &lt;www.monumental.uk.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, projections inside Cuween Hill fall upon rough stone walling, requiring the distance between the aperture and focal plane to be increased, thereby enlarging the image in order to render it visible.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H. eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of images projected within Neolithic passage tombs ===

====Images of the sun====
When aligned upon the sun, a properly configured passage tomb is capable of casting an enlarged image of the solar disc. As long as the aperture remains static this projected solar disc will move along the wall as the sun moves across the sky. During sunrise, for example, the sun’s image will appear to travel across the chamber and then out along the walls of the passageway. Gatton has suggested that images carved upon the chamber walls of Cairn T at Loughcrew may reproduce these movements of the sun’s disc.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, archaeologist Morgan Saletta reported solar projections within the sites of Grotte de Bounias and Grotte de la Source during equinoctial sunsets. These were a result of the architectural format of these monuments creating sufficiently restricted apertures to cast a distinct, though unfocused, projection.&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M.  (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 370-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of midsummer sunrise in 2014 and 2015, Aaron Watson documented solar projections within Bryn Celli Ddu. By locating the aperture close to the chamber it was possible to cast a distinct image of nearby trees and the rising sun, together framed by the outline of the passage. In contrast, relocating the aperture to the passage entrance significantly enlarged the sun’s disc to a diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Images of aligned monuments====
If a passage tomb is aligned upon another monument, the camera obscura method can be used to project recognisable images of that monument into the chamber. For example, while the setting sun shines directly into Maeshowe’s chamber when the sun is at its southwestern extreme (winter solstice sunset), there is also a reverse alignment (summer solstice sunrise) when the sun is at its northeastern extreme. This will illuminate the distant Barnhouse Stone such that its image could be projected inside Maeshowe’s chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Balnuaran of Clava, two neighbouring passage tombs share a south-westerly axis in order that their passageways open towards the midwinter sunset.&lt;ref&gt;See Bradley, R. (2000). The Good Stones: A New Investigation of the Clava Cairns. Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Monograph 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only does the cairn to the south-west appear centrally framed when looking down the passage from that to the north-east, but fieldwork by Ronnie Scott and Tim Phillips has documented how the midwinter setting sun appears to descend directly into the apex of its roof.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1999). “Clava: Light at the End of the Tunnel.” In Current Archaeology 165. 332-335.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Images of the landscape====
Many passage tombs are set in elevated situations with extensive views, or even focused upon distinctive topographic features. These would therefore appear within optical projections inside their chambers. Aaron Watson has documented optical projections inside Cuween Hill, Orkney, that feature expansive views across the Bay of Firth. Inside the Dwarfie Stane, also in Orkney, it is possible to cast a panoramic image of the uplands of Hoy.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the majority of passage tombs may have lost their lintels and roofs it is possible to consider the views that may originally have been projected into their chambers. For example, the ruinous site of Badnabay, north-west Scotland, appears to be aligned upon a mountain with a distinctive profile.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2016). “Archaeo-optics and image projection in the Neolithic.” In &lt;www.monumental.uk.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Images of people====
Reflected sunlight can illuminate people located within passage tomb forecourts, creating what Gatton has described as "spirit" projections due to their ephemeral, spectral qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of Life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  When backlit these figures appear as dark silhouettes, but at those times when the sun is behind the monument, and the forecourt area brightly lit, they are enhanced in color and detail. Aaron Watson has photographed optical projections of people inside Cuween Hill, Wideford Hill, Vinquoy Hill, the Dwarfie Stane and the Grey Cairns of Camster.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Camera obscura projections are animated in a manner akin to cinematography and, while projected human figures appear upside down and back to front, they move in real time. This creates distinctive illusions where individuals, or even groups of people, can appear to emerge from the chamber wall. As the angles between the external subject and the aperture become increasingly oblique, projections can also be cast upon the floor, walls and ceiling of a monument. This can create the illusion of a human shadow moving through the passage tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immersive multisensory experiences within passage tombs ===
Passage tomb architecture spatially constrains the number of people who can simultaneously occupy their chambers, effectively restricting access to specialist kinds of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J. (1992). “Monuments, Movement and the Context of Megalithic Art.” In Vessels for the Ancestors, (Sharples, N. and Sheridan, A., Eds.) Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 62-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  and unusual combinations of sensory experience. Whether these sites embody astronomical orientations, occupy special places in the landscape, or acted as the receptacles for ancestral remains, the camera obscura theory expands the significance and meaning of light entering these monuments.

Inverted images of the outside world, viewed by people located in the depths of a megalithic cairn, would very effectively generate a sense of "otherness".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, people in the Neolithic did not share present-day knowledge of optical physics, and would have had their own understandings. Even from a scientific perspective, however, the act of witnessing the projection of the sun’s disc, or human figures emerging from a stone wall, is rather suggestive of an encounter with the supernatural. It has been suggested that projections of the sun may have been interpreted as the manifestation of a Neolithic solar deity.&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M. (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, optical projections converge with other sensory qualities of these places, potentially including the presence of the remains of the dead, rock art, and dynamic archaeo-acoustic sound effects. There is also a possibility that these kinds of experiences were combined and choreographed in order to maximize their theatrical impact upon an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2001). “The Sounds of Transformation: Acoustics, Monuments and Ritual in the British Neolithic.” In The Archaeology of Shamanism, (Price, N., ed.) London: Routledge. 178-92.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than silent places of the death, passage tombs may have acted as places where people could engage with powerful multi-sensory experiences that transported their occupants to other dimensions, or brought them into the presence of forces that are difficult to imagine in the present day.

==Ancient Egyptian funerary monuments==
The Ancient Egyptians may have also witnessed—and recorded—camera obscura effects. Ancient Egyptian texts, known collectively as the [[Enigmatic Book of the Netherworld|Books of the Netherworld]], describe pharaonic funerary complexes as sun-powered resurrection machines that somehow affected a merger of the pharaoh's soul with the sun god.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, M. (1997). The Complete Pyramids: Solving the Ancient Mysteries. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. 20. For an explanation of how the sun sets off the resurrection process see page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The continuation of the entire cosmos was dependent upon the sun god who was regenerated in darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung, E. (1999). Akhenaten and the Religion of Light [David Lorton, trans.] Ithaca: Cornell University Press. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptian concept of the pharaonic soul was complicated and divided into several aspects. The [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#Ka .28vital spark.29|''ka'' aspect]] was a spirit double, created at birth, with the physical appearance of the person. After death, the ''ka'' would leave the body and travel through the underworld at night and return to its physical representation (the mummy, statue, or artworks) each morning. [[Pharaoh|Pharaonic]] mortuary temples, which faced east toward the dawn sun and were affixed to the side of [[pyramid]]s during the pyramid building era, featured a darkened inner sanctuary with a ''ka'' statue of the pharaoh. When the sun rose on the horizon, its rays would travel down the central passageway of the temple, and project the image of the sun onto the ''ka'' and, conversely, reflect the ''ka'' back to the sun, uniting the two.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Light of Amen-Ra: The key role of projected images in the Pharaoh’s ritual renewal.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the conceptual leap that underpins Ancient Egyptian culture — the pharaoh’s soul road on a beam of light.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Light of Amen-Ra: The key role of projected images in the Pharaoh’s ritual renewal.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek mystery cult rites==
Mystery religions dominated the Mediterranean sphere during classical antiquity. The foremost Mystery sect was the hallowed rite of the Goddess [[Persephone]] at Eleusis, Greece, which held sway for nearly two thousand years (from at least 1500 BCE until the end of fourth century CE). The [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] started out as a small localized religion, grew steadily, and were adopted as part of the state religion of nearby Athens around 600 BCE.

Inside the dark cavernous temple was a sacred smaller building that held cult objects, normally sculptural idols, and a very bright fire. In the temple, the initiates had a direct face-to-face experience with the gods, who appeared as phantoms of light. Plato describes initiates experiencing “perfect, simple, calm, and blissful apparitions [eudaímona phásmata] in a pure light …” ([[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhaedrus%3Asection%3D250c 250c]).

The optical principle of the camera obscura — an image cast into a dark area from an adjacent bright area via a small aperture — works irrespective of the scale of the dark and light areas. If the inside of a room is made very bright and the outside is very dark then a hole will cast the image from the smaller space to the larger, rather like a movie projector in a theater.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2016). “The Eleusinian Projector: The hierophant’s optical method of conjuring the goddess.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Gatton has proposed the priests (or priestesses) at Eleusis had operated a rudimentary projection booth, an "Eleusinian Projector", where the priest’s holy fire-room acted as the box of light and the dark cavernous space crowded with initiates was the theater.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The initiates were not directing their attention toward the priest or the sacred house, but looking the other direction at spectral images that they believed were gods, shining and moving about…” 	-Matt Gatton&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2016). “The Eleusinian Projector: The hierophant’s optical method of conjuring the goddess.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such initiatives are often temporary, informal and citizen-led as well as taking place in unused, if not abandoned, urban spaces&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tonkiss|first=Fran|date=2013|title=Austerity urbanism and the makeshift city.|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13604813.2013.795332|journal=City|volume=17|pages=312-324|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definitions ==
Austerity urbanism can be described in several ways and gathers different components. The following lines present the main definitions and interpretations of the concept.

First, austerity urbanism is based upon two main notions : [[austerity]] and [[urbanism]].

Generally speaking, austerity is ''“a situation in which people’s living standards are reduced because of economic difficulties”'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/austerity|title="Austerity" definition|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' Austerity is also described as ''“a condition of enforced or extreme economy”'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''.'' Here, austerity refers to the reduction of investment, as well as expenditure in general, by the state due to an economy in jeopardy. 

Recent episodes of austerity are often linked with [[neoliberalism]], which is the latest form of [[capitalism]]. Its main idea is to restrict the power of public institutions as well as government spending and to give precedence to the [[market economy]], in order to increase the role of the [[private sector]] in the society as well as maintain [[Public sector|public sectors]] in good financial health. Given that the private sector is in charge in the neoliberal system, public expenditures are less likely to occur. This is what leading to austerity in bad economic times&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Jonathan|last2=Blanco|first2=Ismael|date=2017|title=Austerity urbanism : Patterns of neo-liberalisation and resistance in six cities of Spain and the UK.|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0308518X17701729|journal=Environment and Planning A|volume=49|pages=1517-1536|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Second, austerity urbanism is a type of urbanism that shows the repercussions of austerity. The critical situation of the economy has a significant effect on the development of cities. Investors, due to economic crisis and lack of attractive investment options, reduce the amount of money they invest in cities, leaving neighborhoods or entire cities worse off. In other words, an episode of austerity may leave municipalities with no alternative about the lack of investment of private actors, and create difficulties to manage the development of their cities. Moreover, the possibility for actors from the private sector to withdraw at any moment puts municipalities in a position where they may not have the means to manage their urban development themselves&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Finally, austerity urbanism happens when the private sector reduces its investment. Due to the lack of funds of the municipalities, neighborhoods are at risk of not receiving proper investment. At that point, individuals or local associations may take control and launch their own urban initiatives in places neglected by municipalities. This process often leads to attracting, once again, the private sector after those places have been reshaped for temporary use by the local community. In the meantime, the actions of local communities work as transitional uses before future developments&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

== Origins ==
To understand the emergence of austerity urbanism, it is necessary to explore first the notion of austerity and its impacts throughout history as austerity urbanism appears later as a consequence of such a context.

The notion of austerity is not new in the history of humankind, but as an explicit concept, it did not start to be until the beginning of the 20th century. The economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] was amongst the first ones to use it. In the wake of [[World War I]], he made known his disagreement on the [[Treaty of Versailles]], opining that it was not a good idea to impose an economy of austerity on Germany. He argued that it would also weaken other countries in Europe. The risk was also that the impoverishment of Germany could raise fierce opposition to the treaty in Germany and maybe even a revolution. At that time, Keynes supported a more interventionist economic policy and was therefore against a deliberate austerity build up&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dostaler|first=Gilles|date=2007|title=Les fondements philosophiques de l'oeuvre de Keynes.|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/DOSLFP|journal=The Proceedings of the Twenty-First World Congress of Philosophy : Logic and Philosophy of the Sciences|volume=5|pages=155-160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the 1930s, the notion of austerity reappeared with the [[Great Depression]] and its consequences, Europe as a whole being in a situation of austerity. This crisis framework appeared again after the [[World War II|Second World War]], plunging several European countries into a state of misery, which can be qualified as austerity. At this moment, it was clear that the continent needed to rebuild its devastated lands and cities.

This state of austerity gradually faded away during "[[Trente Glorieuses|The Glorious Thirty]]" but resurfaced quickly in the 1980s with the general awareness of ecological limits and key resource depletion which suggested the rethinking of the socio-economic system. Then, with the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|subprime crisis]] in 2007-2008, the notion of austerity came back strongly and explicitly especially in the economic and urban realm. Indeed, the changing economic conditions led to the emergence of the concept of austerity urbanism. In austerity urbanism, cities have to take care of themselves since ''“municipal governments act as cost-saving business actors that envisage running cities like corporations”'' &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peck|first=Jamie|date=2015|title=Austerity urbanism : The neoliberal crisis of American cities|url=http://www.rosalux-nyc.org/wp-content/files_mf/peck_austerity_urbanism_eng.pdf|journal=Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung : New York|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Even if the situation is not uniform across cities, nor completely comparable, the manifestation of austerity became ''“evident at the urban scale”''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Nowadays, there are several ideological undercurrents involved in the austerity narrative. On the one hand, the “economy of means” current suggests that one must stop living beyond one's means. In order to reduce the negative consequences of austerity urbanism, such as the rise of youth unemployment as well as poverty, social exclusion and the increasing debt prevailing in most Western economies for example&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anyadike-Danes|first=Michael|last2=Fitoussi|first2=Jean-Paul|last3=Le Cacheux|first3=Jacques|date=1983|title=De l'austérité budgétaire en période de récession.|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/ofce_0751-6614_1983_num_5_1_958|journal=Observations et diagnostics économiques : revue de l'OFCE|volume=5|pages=121-148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it is considered necessary to be cautious regarding public expenses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sen|first=Amartya|date=2015|title=Les conséquences économiques de l’austérité.|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-l-economie-politique-2015-3-p-102.htm|journal=L'Économie politique|volume=|pages=102-112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this can result in the mistrust in the institutions and this increasing dissatisfaction leads to the weakening of the aforesaid institutions. On the other hand, when austerity reaches its limits, it can also open up new opportunities and therefore generate great possibilities in the urbanistic field, such as citizen-led initiatives taking place in unusual spaces or forms, in an attempt from the population to counteract the crisis situation and austerity measures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

To sum up, there is therefore a crisis-linked austerity situation in opposition to an ideological vision of prudence, which tend to maintain a pressure for unnecessary cost-avoidance. Between these two perspectives, it may be quite difficult to carry out urban planning assignments, as it necessarily implies investments at a time when funds are seemingly lacking. This is the global context in which the notion of austerity urbanism emerged, whose definition was proposed in 2012 by various authors, including Fran Tonkiss and Jamie Peck. The notion of austerity in urban planning is evolving, not being always a negative assertion, but also valuing the opportunities and innovative solutions that are created within the practice of urban planning. The notion of austerity urbanism is in fact more and more linked to that of [[tactical urbanism]] and improvisational urbanism, emphasizing in particular the growing importance of citizen solidarity. These connotations complement what has to be considered, altogether, as a progressive vision of urbanism where the game is to take advantage of a crisis to allow for new collective achievements to emerge.

== Practical interventions under conditions of austerity ==
Planning under austerity can lead to alternative and critical spatial practices, that are described by [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] as a strategy for ''“dealing with the existing city [in] the search for underused space and time, and its readaptation for a desired activity. We can explore the use of streets as play areas, or the possibilities for using roof tops, empty stores, abandoned buildings, waste lots, odd bits of land, or the large areas presently sterilized by such mono-cultures as parking lots, expressways, railroad yards, and airports”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City Sense and City Design: Writings and Projects of Kevin Lynch|last=Lynch|first=Kevin|publisher=MIT Press.|year=1995|isbn=|editor-last=Banerjee|editor-first=T.|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=771-788|chapter=The Possible City (1968)|editor-last2=Southworth|editor-first2=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

These makeshift, informal and often temporary urban interventions were categorized by Fran Tonkiss in four protocols for planning under austerity, depending on the degree of facilitation by existing policies&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;:

# The ''“Positive model”'' provides the best conditions for the development of such self-organized interventions as it integrates their informal nature into formal processes, by offering building permits for instance.
# The ''“Permissive model”'' neither facilitates, nor excludes unconventional planning strategies, being based on a tolerant approach regarding them.
# The “''Proscription model''” on the other hand leaves almost no space for negotiation and improvisation initiatives by criminalizing or implementing punitive measures against them.
# The ''“Abandonment model”'' positions these interventions as an urbanism of last resort, in response to the complete roll back of the state in terms of territorial governance.

[[File:Berlin-Kreuzberg Prinzessinnengärten 1.jpg|thumb|Prinzessinnengärten, Berlin Kreuzberg]]
In reality, these four approaches are often combined, as the case of [[Squatting in England and Wales|squatting]] in some British cities that is a mix of the third and the fourth model. Indeed, in 2012, residential squatting was criminalized in England, and at the same time, budget cutback made it difficult to positively promote alternative practices, despite the ambitions of the [[Big Society]] political ideology. This situation was paradoxical considering that at that time the number of empty houses in the country well exceeded the number of squatters in the UK&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

On a more micro-scale level, interstitial urbanism such as [[community gardening]] is another form of alternative urban interventions, open to improvisation and adaptation. Such initiatives can take place on brownfields, waste ground like the [[:de:Prinzessinnengärten|Prinzessinnengärten]] in Berlin or even in-between two buildings, as it is the case with the self-managed space on the rue [http://www.urbantactics.org/projets/passage56/ Saint-Blaise 56] in Paris&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petcou|first=Constantin|last2=Petrescu|first2=Doina|date=2007|title=Agir l’espace : notes transversales, observations de terrain et questions concrètes pour chacun de nous|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-multitudes-2007-4-page-101.htm|journal=Multitudes|volume=31|pages=101-114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In a context of austerity, these sites represent an important testing ground for urban experimentation as well as providing local services and spaces to counteract the lack of public policy&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

=== The case of Todmorden, England ===
[[File:Todmorden.jpg|thumb|Urban vegetable gardens along the Rochdale canal, Todmorden]]
[[Todmorden]] is a northern English town that engaged in austerity urbanism following the [[deindustrialization]]. Between the 1970s and 2010, the city lost about half of its population, mostly being workers that became unemployed. In response to the crisis, citizens had the idea of producing food in public spaces, cultivating vegetables in [[Urban horticulture|urban gardens]] located in every unused space around the city like next to the train station, the main road or even the police station&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pages.rts.ch/emissions/abe/5974537-sous-les-paves-des-legumes.html#5974539|title=RTS documentary about the Incredible Edible project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Todmorden is in fact the first city in the world to have launched, in 2008, a food [[self-sufficiency]] initiative, called the [[Incredible Edible]]. Nowadays, the project is still successfully going and contributes to strengthening social bonds and solidarity among the population&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://orgprints.org/24956/28/24956.pdf|title=Diversifying Foods and Diets: Using Agricultural Biodiversity to Improve Nutrition and Health.|last=Paull|first=John|publisher=Earthscan, Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Franzo|editor-first=J.|location=Oxford|pages=336-345|chapter="Please Pick Me" – How Incredible Edible Todmorden is repurposing the commons for open source food and agricultural biodiversity|editor-last2=Hunter|editor-first2=D.|editor-last3=Borelli|editor-first3=T.|editor-last4=Mattei|editor-first4=F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Criticism ==
Temporary urbanism can involve risks. Indeed, temporary and self-organized projects could also be used to keep unused lands attractive while the economy is in crisis&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and therefore facilitating the state withdrawal from its responsibilities. As Margit Mayer pointed out, ''“principles such as self-management, self-realization and all kinds of unconventional or insurgent creativity (…) have lost the radical edge they used to entail in the context of the overbearing Keynesian welfare state - in today’s neoliberal urbanism they have been usurped as essential ingredients of sub-local regeneration programs”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Margit|date=2013|title=First World Urban Activism: Beyond Austerity Urbanism and Creative City Politics.|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13604813.2013.757417|journal=City|volume=17|pages=5-19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The concept itself of austerity urbanism is the subject of different critical points of views. From a [[Free market|free-market]] perspective, austerity is a necessary, if temporary, measure to assure the financial health of the public sector where it has been spending too much and faces a large amount of debt and deficit. This perspective relates to the orthodox neoclassical economic theory which argues, against a Keynesian ideology, that public investments are bad for the economy in a long term. For the free-market advocates, austerity is a way to purge non-efficient institutions and enterprises and let new technologies and strategies emerge in a [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeterian]] creative destruction perspective. Translated to urban planning theories, austerity means that it is beneficial for the economy to cut public investments in urban development and let private initiatives and the private sector run cities. Entrepreneurial urbanism argues that the public sector should function more like the private sector and seek to make returns on investment on public spending and be competitive to decrease the distortions of public intervention in the market&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

On the other hand, heterodox economy, radical geography, other fields of research, and left wing or Marxists political parties see austerity as a punitive and non-justified policy related to a pejorative perception of neoliberalism. Increasing inequalities, gaps in the rights to the city, and social injustice, austerity urbanism leads to what [[David Harvey]] describes as ''“accumulation by dispossession''”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. In this point of view, austerity should be stopped and new social strategies of urban development should be organized to fight the commodification and financialisation of cities&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

'''Beatriz González''' is a painter, sculptor, critic, curator, art historian, and is considered one of the founders of what is known today as [[Colombian art#20th century and modernism|Modern Colombian]] Art.&lt;ref name="Morgan Frigeri Coustou Dzuveroric 2015 p. 195"&gt;{{cite book | last=Morgan | first=J. | last2=Frigeri | first2=F. | last3=Coustou | first3=E. | last4=Dzuveroric | first4=L. | title=The World Goes Pop | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2015 | isbn=978-0-300-21699-8 | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NkTOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257 | access-date=13 January 2018 | page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is often associated with the [[Pop Art]] movement, and is best known for her bright and colorful paintings depicting the traumatic social context in her home country,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amuse-i-d.vice.com/meet-beatriz-gonzalez-colombias-queen-of-pop-art/|title=Meet Beatriz Gonzalez, Colombia’s Queen of Pop Art {{!}} Amuse|last=Loiseau|first=Benoît|date=2016-11-02|work=Amuse|access-date=2017-11-15|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically during the war torn period in Colombia that is known as [[La Violencia]].

== Biography ==
Beatriz González was born in [[Bucaramanga]], Colombia in 1938. She has described herself as always loving art and drawing a lot, but never thinking that would end up being her profession. In the late 1950s, she enrolled in architecture school, but she dropped out only a few years later.  González ended up enrolling in [[University of Los Andes (Colombia)]], graduating from their fine arts department in 1962.

González grew up in Colombia during the 1940s and 50s which was a very dark time in the history of Colombia. The country was plagued with violence and war that was due to the social and political upheaval that is known as [[La Violencia]]. Growing up during this time largely influenced González's understanding of Colombia society, and eventually even her artistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ey-exhibition-world-goes-pop/artist-biography/beatriz-gonzalez|title=Beatriz González  {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
González has drawn inspiration for her art from many different sources, specifically naming [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Diego Velázquez]] and [[Antonio Molinari]] as inspirations when it comes to the use of colors and shapes.

Although González is often thought of and referred to as an artist of the pop art movement, she has never considered herself a pop artist. She often thought that the pop movement was not present in her preferred medium of painting and that it wouldn't be an appropriate label for the work she was doing. When asked if she had at any point considered herself a pop artist she responded with, "I’ve always considered myself more of a painter and within this remit I painted the joy of the underdeveloped. For me the type of art that I was doing could only circulate internationally as a curiosity. Mine was a provincial type of art without horizons, confronting the everyday: art is international."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ey-exhibition-world-goes-pop/artist-interview/beatriz-gonzalez|title=Artist interview: Beatriz González {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that all of the art she has done isn't "Pop", but in fact art that is a homage to her hometown of Bucaramanga and reflects its bold colors.

She has oftentimes been acknowledged for being a woman in a movement and country where a great deal of her peers were men, according to González, this has never been a problem for her and credits [[Marta Traba]] for encouraging the presence of woman in the Colombian art scene and states that she doesn't believe in the complex of the female artist who must be victimized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1965 González created a painting entitled ''The Suicides of Sisga'', the painting was based on a picture of a young couple that had been published in a local newspaper after they jumped off the dam of the river Sisga in order to preserve the purity of their love. This work was initially refused at the 1965 Salon of Colombian Artists, disregarded and brushed off by the Jury as a "bad Botero". After one of González's friends and mentors, [[Marta Traba]] pressed the Jury to reconsider their decision, the painting was not only accepted, but Gonzáles won a special prize for her work, that eventually helped launch her career.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This painting is now known to reflect the impact of sensationalism of the national press of the creation of popular myths.

After accompanying her husband who is an architect to a hardware store in the 1970s, she began her work on various pieces of store-bought furniture that would generally be found in middle-class households earlier in the century. Typically she would take her images from well known Italian Renaissance and history paintings, or pictures from the present day news media, transferring these images onto cheap nightstands, chairs, coffee tables and beds painted by an amateur painter. She carefully coordinated her images with the furniture's function, such as painting the popes face on nightstands, conjuring up devotional images commonly found over beds or on nightstands in the average Colombian household.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Art of Latin America|last=Barnitz|first=Jacqueline|last2=Frank|first2=Patrick|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 González's work took a dramatic stylistic shift from its vibrant colors and shapes, to more dark imagery. This was after the M-19 guerrilla attack on the [[Palace of Justice siege|Palace of Justice]] in an attempt to try to president, they left 94 dead. Feeling that she couldn't laugh after that event, she began to explore themes of death and the drug trade as well as exploring some of Colombia's most tragic events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Individual artworks ==

=== The Suicides of Sisga I, II and III ===
One of González's most well known and earliest works depicts a young couple standing holding hands with one other and a bouquet of flowers with a slight smile on their faces. This painting was based off a photo that originally appeared in the press of a couple who commissioned a professional photographer to take their portrait before jumping off the dam of the Sisga on the outskirts of Bogotá. The couple were two young farmers who were deeply in love, but in an effort to preserve the purity of their love, the man (who was suspected to be mentally insane) convinced his girlfriend to commit suicide as a way to show their religious devotion in not wanting to sully the woman's purity. The picture was sent to their families, and when the news broke it was widely reprinted in black and white in the local newspapers. González claimed that she was attracted to this picture due to its "bad quality" or more so its plain quality, the simplification of the facial features that were almost deformed by the discrepancy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This painting was the first of a number of paintings done by González in the 1960s in which she explored the intense violence in Colombia. During this time she produced a series of ink drawings on the same theme, that were tabloid photos of crimes of passion and political murders as well as advertisements for everything from bodybuilding to headache cures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/04/arts/art-review-a-wry-defiance-behind-garish-colors-and-tabloid-dramas.html|title=ART REVIEW; A Wry Defiance Behind Garish Colors and Tabloid Dramas|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=1998-09-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== La última mesa (The Last Table) ===
This work was one of González's first furniture pieces out of her series of furniture works. It consisted of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]] work that had been repainted onto metal sheets that were them mounted on a faux-wood dining table. González intentionally chose this particular work by da Vinci because of its popularity in Colombian culture, this image was commonly placed above the main entrance door as a good-luck charm against thieves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This work along with many of the others out of her furniture works had the intention of being a "representation of representations"  not only through an effort to make universal art, but also to subvert the original function of the furniture itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inverted Utopias|last=Ramírez|first=Mari Carmen|publisher=Yale University|year=2004|isbn=|location=Houston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, she intentionally takes all of the shadows and duller colors that made this work more European, and animated it more in hopes of making it more uniquely Latin American.

=== Nací en Florencia (I was born in Florence) ===
The full title of this work is ''Nací en Florencia y tenía 26 años cuando fue pintado mi retrato (esta frase pronunciada en una voz dulce y baja)'', translated to ''I was born in Florence and was 26 years old when my portrait was painted (this phrase pronounced in a low, sweet voice).'' In this work, González placed her own painting of [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' where the mirror would be on a very large and elaborate antique coat rack. She used the location of the would be mirror to frame her work so when the viewers look at the work they see an image of beauty recreated in a cheap, reproduced style. The long title of the work is in an additional effort to reveal its humorous and a potentially slightly erotic intent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== ''Canción de cuna (Lullaby)'' ===
This work consisted of an image of a mother holding her child that was based on a picture that was widely printed and distributed by a printing company in Colombia. The painting was painted on a sheet of metal that was then mounted on the inside of a crib that González found in the streets of Bogóta that originally belonged to a hospital. The theme of mother and child was one that commonly occurred in her artwork thus turning González herself into an image of maternity and hints at her observations about woman in the social structure of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/125437?artist_id=36415&amp;locale=en&amp;sov_referrer=artist|title=Beatriz González.

{{about|the conservation biology topic|other uses of "BAP"|BAP (disambiguation)}}

A '''biodiversity action plan''' ('''BAP''') is an internationally recognized program addressing [[threatened species]] and [[habitat]]s and is designed to protect and restore biological systems. The original impetus for these plans derives from the 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD). As of 2009, 191 countries have ratified the CBD, but only a fraction of these have developed substantive BAP documents.

The principal elements of a BAP typically include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glowka |first=Lyle |author2=Françoise Burhenne-Guilmin |author3=Hugh Synge |author4=Jeffrey A. McNeely |author5=Lothar Gündling |title=Guide to the Convention on Biodiversity |year=1994 |publisher=IUCN |isbn=2-8317-0222-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a) preparing inventories of biological information for selected species or habitats; (b) assessing the [[conservation status]] of species within specified [[ecosystem]]s; (c) creation of targets for [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[Restoration ecology|restoration]]; and (d) establishing budgets, timelines and institutional partnerships for implementing the BAP.

==Species plans==
[[File:Lightmatter snowleopard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Snow leopard]], Pakistan, an endangered species]]

A fundamental method of engagement to a BAP is thorough documentation regarding individual species, with emphasis upon the population distribution and [[Conservation biology|conservation]] status. This task, while fundamental, is highly daunting, since only an estimated ten percent of the world’s species are believed to have been characterized as of 2006,&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 IUCN Red-list statistics (2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630000000/http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 |date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of these unknowns being [[fungi]], [[invertebrate]] animals, micro-organisms and plants. For many bird, mammal and reptile species, information is often available in published literature; however, for fungi, invertebrate animals, micro-organisms and many plants, such information may require considerable local data collection. It is also useful to compile time trends of population estimates in order to understand the dynamics of population variability and vulnerability. In some parts of the world complete species inventories are not realistic; for example, in the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]], many species are completely undocumented and much of the region has never even been systematically explored by scientists.

A species plan component of a country’s BAP should ideally entail a thorough description of the range, habitat, behaviour, breeding and interaction with other species. Once a determination has been made of conservation status (e.g. [[rare species|rare]], endangered, threatened, vulnerable), a plan can then be created to conserve and restore the species population to target levels. Examples of programmatic protection elements are: habitat restoration; protection of habitat from [[urban development]]; establishment of property ownership; limitations on grazing or other agricultural encroachment into habitat; reduction of [[slash-and-burn]] agricultural practises; outlawing killing or collecting the species; restrictions on pesticide use; and control of other environmental pollution. The plan should also articulate which public and private agencies should implement the protection strategy and indicate budgets available to execute this strategy.

==Habitat plans==
Where a number of threatened species depend upon a specific habitat, it may be appropriate to prepare a habitat protection element of the Biodiversity Action Plan. Examples of such special habitats are: raised acidic bogs of Scotland; [[Waterberg Biosphere]] [[bushveld]] in South Africa; California’s coastal [[wetland]]s; and Sweden’s [[Stora Alvaret]] on the island of [[Öland]]. In this case also, careful inventories of species and also the geographic extent and quality of the habitat must be documented. Then, as with species plans, a program can be created to protect, enhance and/or restore habitat using similar strategies as discussed above under the species plans.

==Specific countries==
Some examples of individual countries which have produced substantive Biodiversity Action Plans follow. In every example the plans concentrate on plants and vertebrate animals, with very little attention to neglected groups such as fungi, invertebrate animals and micro-organisms, even though these are also part of biodiversity. Preparation of a country BAP may cost up to 100 million pounds sterling, with annual maintenance costs roughly ten percent of the initial cost. If plans took into account neglected groups, the cost would be higher. Obviously costs for countries with small geographical area or simplified ecosystems have a much lesser cost. For example, the St. Lucia BAP has been costed in the area of several million pounds sterling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2001| author=Government of St. Lucia| title=National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan of St. Lucia| url=http://www.slubiodiv.org/The_Project/Information/Printed_Materials/NBSAP/nbsap.html| accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061105113956/http://www.slubiodiv.org/The_Project/Information/Printed_Materials/NBSAP/nbsap.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Daintree Rainforest.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Daintree Rainforest]] in [[Queensland]], Australia]]
Australia has developed a detailed and rigorous Biodiversity Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2011| author=Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council| title=Australia's Biodiversity Conservation Strategy 2010-2030| url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/au/au-nbsap-v2-en.pdf| accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document estimates that the total number of indigenous species may be 560,000, many of which are endemic. A key element of the BAP is protection of the [[Great Barrier Reef]], which is actually in a much higher state of health than most of the world’s [[reef]]s, Australia having one of the highest percentages of treated [[wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=September 2005| author=Commonwealth of Australia, Department of the Environment and Heritage| title=Great Barrier Reef Water Quality Protection Plan Annual Report 2004-2005| url=http://www.deh.gov.au/coasts/publications/annual-report/04-05/index.html| accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060822025646/http://www.deh.gov.au/coasts/publications/annual-report/04-05/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however,serious ongoing concerns, particularly in regards to the ongoing negative impact on water quality from land use practices. Also, climate change impact is feared to be significant.

Considerable analysis has been conducted on the [[Sustainable forestry|sustainable]] yield of firewood production, a major threat to [[deforestation]] in most tropical countries. Biological inventory work; assessment of harvesting practices; and computer modeling of the dynamics of treefall, rot and harvest; have been carried out to adduce data on safe harvesting rates. Extensive research has also been conducted on the relation of brush clearance to [[biodiversity]] decline and impact on [[water table]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Glanznig, ''Native Vegetation Clearance, Habitat Loss and Biodiversity Decline: an overview of recent native vegetation clearance in Australia and its implications for biodiversity'', Biodiversity Series, Paper No. 6, Biodiversity Unit, June 1995&lt;/ref&gt; for example, these effects have been analyzed in the [[Toolibin Lake]] wetlands region.

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Biodiversity of New Zealand}}
New Zealand has ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity and as part of The New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy and Biodiversity Action Plans are implemented on ten separate themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Dept. of Conservation; Ministry for the Environment| isbn = 978-0-478-21919-7| title = The New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy| location = [Wellington, N.Z.]| date = February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local government and some companies also have their own Biodiversity Action Plan.

===St. Lucia===
The [[St. Lucia]] BAP recognizes impacts of large numbers of tourists to the marine and coastal diversity of the [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufrière]] area of the country. The BAP specifically acknowledges that the [[carrying capacity]] for human use and [[water pollution]] discharge of sensitive reef areas was exceeded by the year 1990. The plan also addresses conservation of the historic island fishing industry. In 1992, several institutions in conjunction with native fishermen to produce a sustainable management plan for fishery resources, embodied in the Soufrière Marine Management Area.

The St. Lucia BAP features significant involvement from the [[University of the West Indies]]. Specific detailed attention is given to three species of threatened marine turtles, to a variety of vulnerable birds and a number of [[pelagic fish]]es and [[cetacean]]s. In terms of [[habitat conservation]] the plan focusses attention on the biologically productive [[mangrove]] swamps and notes that virtually all mangrove areas had already come under national protection by 1984.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Lucia National Marine Fisheries Act of 1984, Section 10'', (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanzania===
The Tanzania national BAP addresses issues related to sustainable use of [[Lake Manyara]], an extensive freshwater lake, whose usage by humans accelerated in the period 1950 to 1990. The designation of the [[Lake Manyara Biosphere Reserve]] under [[UNESCO]]'s [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]] in 1981 combines conservation of the lake and surrounding high value forests with sustainable use of the wetlands area and simple agriculture. This BAP has united principal lake users in establishing management targets. The biosphere reserve has induced sustainable management of the wetlands, including monitoring [[groundwater]] and the chemistry of the [[escarpment]] water source.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Manyara|url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&amp;code=URT+01|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Fowlsheughclifftonorthsea.JPG|thumb|[[Fowlsheugh]] cliffs, [[Scotland]], a protected [[seabird]] breeding habitat]]
The [[United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan]] covers not only [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] species associated with lands within the UK, but also marine species and [[Bird migration|migratory]] birds, which spend a limited time in the UK or its offshore waters. The UK plan encompasses "391 Species Action Plans, 45 Habitat Action Plans and 162 Local Biodiversity Action Plans with targeted actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan| url=http://www.ukbap.org.uk/| author=Joint Nature Conservation Committee, London| year=2006| accessdate=2006-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan is noteworthy because of its extensive detail, clarity of endangerment mechanisms, specificity of actions, follow up monitoring program and its inclusion of migrating cetaceans and pelagic birds.

On August 28, 2007, the new Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) [launched in 1997] identified 1,149 species and 65 habitats in the UK that needed conservation and greater protection. The updated list included the [[hedgehog]], [[house sparrow]], [[grass snake]] and the [[garden tiger moth]], while [[otter]]s, [[bottlenose dolphin]]s and [[red squirrel]]s remained in need of habitat protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6965681.stm BBC NEWS, Hedgehogs join 'protection' list]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the European Commission adopted a new strategy to halt the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the EU by 2020, in line with the commitments made at the 10th meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) held in Nagoya, Japan in 2010. In 2012 the UK BAP was succeeded by the 'UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework'.

==== UK BAP website ====
To support the work of the UK BAP, the UK BAP website was created by JNCC in 2001. The website contained information on the BAP process, hosted all relevant documents, and provided news and relevant updates. In March 2011, as part of the UK government’s review of websites, the UK BAP site was ‘closed’, and the core content was migrated into the JNCC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UK Biodiversity Action Plan| url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=5155| author=Joint Nature Conservation Committee, London| year=2012| accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Content from the original UK BAP website has been archived by the [[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] as snapshots from various dates (for example, UK ''BAP'': copy March 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UK Biodiversity Action Plan archive copy| url=http://www.ukbap.org.uk/default.aspx| author=National Archives, London| year=2011| accessdate=2012-10-28| deadurl=yes| archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110303145238/http://www.ukbap.org.uk/default.aspx| archivedate=March 3, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Twenty-six years prior to the international biodiversity convention, the United States had launched a national program to protect threatened species in the form of the 1966 [[Endangered Species Act]]. The legislation created broad authority for analyzing and listing species of concern, and mandated that Species [[Endangered Species Recovery Plan|Recovery Plan]]s be created. Thus, while the USA is an unratified signer of the accord, arguably it has the longest track record and most comprehensive program of species protection of any country. There are about 7000 listed species (e.g. endangered or threatened), of which about half have approved Recovery Plans. While this number of species seems high compared to other countries, the value is rather indicative of the total number of species characterized, which is extremely large.

===Uzbekistan===
Five major divisions of habitat have been identified in [[Uzbekistan]]’s BAP: Wetlands (including reed habitat and man-made [[marsh]]); desert ecosystems (including sandy, stony and clay); [[steppes]]; [[riparian]] ecosystems; and mountain ecosystems. Over 27,000 species have been inventoried in the country, with a high rate of [[endemism]] for fishes and reptiles. Principal threats to biodiversity are related to human activities associated with overpopulation and generally related to agricultural intensification.&lt;ref&gt;''Biodiversity Conservation National Strategy and Action Plan of Republic of Uzbekistan'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Major geographic regions encompassed by the BAP include the [[Aral Sea]] Programme (threatened by long-term drainage and [[salination]], largely for cotton production), the Nuratau Biosphere Reserve, and the Western [[Tien Shan Mountains]] Programme (in conjunction with [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]).

==Criticism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Some developing countries criticize the emphasis of BAPs, because these plans inherently favour consideration of [[wildlife]] protection above food and industrial production, and in some cases may represent an obstacle to population growth. The plans are costly to produce, a fact which makes it difficult for many smaller countries and poorer countries to comply. In terms of the plans themselves, many countries have adopted pro-forma plans including little research and even less in the way of natural resource management. Almost universally, this has resulted in plans which emphasize plants and vertebrate animals, and which overlook fungi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Micheli Guide to Fungal Conservation| url=http://www.fungal-conservation.org/micheli.htm| author=International Society for Fungal Conservation| year=2012| accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; invertebrate animals and micro-organisms. With regard to specific world regions, there is a notable lack of substantive participation by most of the Middle Eastern countries and much of Africa, the latter of which may be impeded by economic considerations of plan preparation. Some governments such as the [[European Union]] have diverted the purpose of a biodiversity action plan, and implemented the convention accord by a set of economic development policies with referencing certain ecosystems' protection.

==Biodiversity planning: a new way of thinking==
The definition of biodiversity under the Convention on Biological Diversity now recognises that biodiversity is a combination of ecosystem structure and function, as much as its components e.g. species, habitats and genetic resources. Article 2 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''in addressing the boundless complexity of biological diversity, it has become conventional to think in hierarchical terms, from the genetic material within individual cells, building up through individual organisms, populations, species and communities of species, to the biosphere overall...At the same time, in seeking to make management intervention as efficient as possible, it is essential to take an holistic view of biodiversity and address the interactions that species have with each other and their non-living environment, i.e. to work from an ecological perspective.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The World Summit on Sustainable Development endorsed the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity to ''“achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of [[biodiversity loss]] at the global, regional and national level as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of life on Earth”.'' To achieve this outcome, biodiversity management will depend on maintaining structure and function.&lt;ref&gt;Noss, R.F. (1990) Indicators for Monitoring Biodiversity: A Hierarchical Approach. Conservation Biology 4 (4) 355–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity is not singularly definable but may be understood via a series of management principles under BAPs, such as:

1. that biodiversity is conserved across all levels and scales – structure, function and composition are conserved at site, regional, state and national scales. 
2. that examples of all ecological communities are adequately managed for conservation.  
3. ecological communities are managed to support and enhance viable populations of animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants and ecological functions.

Biodiversity and wildlife are not the same thing. The traditional focus on threatened species in BAPs is at odds with the principles of biodiversity management because, by the time species become threatened, the processes that maintain biodiversity are already compromised. Individual species are also regarded as generally poor indicators of biodiversity when it comes to actual planning.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmayer, D. B., Manning, A. D., Smith, P. L., Possingham, Hugh P., Fischer, J., Oliver, I., McCarthy, M. A., (2002) The Focal-Species Approach and Landscape Restoration: A Conservation Biology 16(2) 338–345&lt;/ref&gt; A species approach to BAPs only serves to identify and at best, apply a patch to existing problems. Increasingly, biodiversity planners are looking through the lens of [[ecosystem services]]. Critics of biodiversity are often confusing the need to protect species (their intrinsic value) with the need to maintain ecosystem processes, which ultimately maintain human society and do not compromise economic development. Hence, a core principle of biodiversity management, that traditional BAPs overlook, is the need to incorporate cultural, social and economic values in the process.

Modern day BAPs use an analysis of [[ecosystem services]], key ecological process drivers, and use species as one of many indicators of change. They would seek to maintain structure and function by addressing habitat connectivity and resilience and may look at communities of species (threatened or otherwise) as one method of monitoring outcomes. Ultimately, species are the litmus test for biodiversity – viable populations of species can only be expected to exist in relatively intact habitats. However, the rationale behind BAPs is to "conserve and restore" biodiversity. One of the fastest developing areas of management is [http://www.bioenergywiki.net/index.php/Biodiversity_Offsets biodiversity offsets]. The principles are in keeping with ecological impact assessment, which in turn depends on good quality BAPs for evaluation. Contemporary principles of biodiversity management, such as those produced by the [http://www.forest-trends.org/biodiversityoffsetprogram/ Business Biodiversity Offsets Program]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://eianzecology.blogspot.com/2009/03/principles-in-biodiversity-offsets.html|title= Principles in Biodiversity Offsets}}&lt;/ref&gt; are now integral to any plans to manage biodiversity, including the development of BAPs.

'''Institut Pertanian Bogor''' ('''IPB''' or '''Bogor Agricultural University''') is a state-run agricultural university based in the city of [[Bogor]], [[Indonesia]].

The institute began as an agricultural school formed by the Dutch colonial regime in the early 20th century. After independence it was part of the [[Universitas Indonesia]] before becoming an independent institute on September 1, 1963.&lt;ref name="Embryonal step"&gt;[http://ipb.ac.id/about/history-of-ipb-embrional-step History of IPB Embryonal Step (1941-1963)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Growth phase"&gt;[http://ipb.ac.id/about/history-of-ipb-growth-phase History of IPB Growth phase].&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Dr. Ir. Herry Suhardiyanto, M.Sc. serves as its director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipb.ac.id/about/rectors-of-ipb History of IPB - Rectors] retrieved September 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Middelbare Landbouwschool Buitenzorg TMnr 60016646.jpg|thumb|The Middelbare Landbouwschool Buitenzorg in the 1920s]]
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Nederlands-Indische Veeartsenschool Buitenzorg TMnr 60016929.jpg|thumb|The Nederlandsch Indiche Veeartsenschool in the 1920s]]
The first school in Bogor was established in 1876 under [[Rudolph Scheffer]], under the name ''landbouwschool te Buitenzorg'' (agriculture school).&lt;ref name="Scheffer, Rudolph Herman Christiaan Carel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaalherbarium.nl/FMCollectors/S/SchefferRHCC.htm|title=Scheffer, Rudolph Herman Christiaan Carel|publisher=[[National Herbarium of the Netherlands]]|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; New schools for different fields were opened in the following years for Native Indonesians. The institute started in the early 20th century as a veterinary medicine and agricultural school.&lt;ref name="Embryonal step"/&gt; Before World War II, the institutions were known as Middelbare Landbouwschool (secondary agricultural school), Middelbare Bosbouwschool (secondary forestry school) dan Nederlandsch Indiche Veeartsenschool (veterinary school).&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt; [[:nl:Hermanus_Johannes_Lovink|H. J. Lovink's]] appointment as department director of agricultural education in 1910 marked a curriculum shift toward training for the government and private sides of colonial agribusiness, including basic biology classes augmented with practical education about cultivation techniques and technologies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Floracrats: State-Sponsored Science and the Failure of the Enlightenment in Indonesia|last=Goss|first=Andrew|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-299-24864-2|location=United States of America|pages=92|quote=|via=Open Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:nl:Hermanus_Johannes_Lovink|Lovink]] argued that department officials in the Ministry of Agriculture "needed to familiarize themselves with Javanese farming practices."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1940, the Dutch government founded an Institution of Agricultural Higher Education in Bogor with the name Landbouw Hogeschool, which later on 31 October 1941 was called Landbouwkundige Faculteit (Agronomy Faculty). However, the school was closed down during the Japanese occupation (1942-1945). The Nederlandsch Indische Veeartsenschool remained in operation, but its name was changed to Bogōru jūigakkō (ボゴール獣医学校) (Bogor Veterinary School).&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt;

Sometime after the declaration of independence in 1946, the Ministry of Social Welfare of the new Republic of Indonesia upgraded the Veterinary School in Bogor to the College of Veterinary Medicine (PTKH).&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt;

The Netherlands returned to Indonesia and retook control of the institution in 1947, thus Landbouwkundige Faculteit was reopened as the Faculteit Voor Landbouw-Wetenschappen, which had majors in Agriculture and Forestry. In 1948 the PTKH or College of Veterinary Medicine was changed to Faculteit voor Diergeneeskunde under Universiteit van Indonesië (later the [[University of Indonesia]]).&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt; 
 
After Indonesia gained its independence in 1950, Landbouw-wetenschappen became the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Indonesia, with three departments — Socio-Economics, Physical Sciences, and Forestry. In 1957 the Department of Land Fishery was formed. Meanwhile, Faculteit voor Dieergeneeskunde became the Faculty of Veterinary Medicines and Animal Husbandry.&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt;

IPB was founded on September 1, 1963 by the decision of the Minister of Science and Higher Education No. 92/1963 and was approved by President [[Sukarno]]'s decree No. 279/1965.&lt;ref name="Growth phase" /&gt; At the time, the two faculties of University of Indonesia which is in Bogor were separated into an independent institution. The new university (IPB) has five faculties: Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine, Fisheries, Animal Science, and Forestry. In 1964 the Faculty of Technology and Mechanization of Agriculture was added.&lt;ref name="Growth phase" /&gt;

===Recent events===
On December 26, 2000 the Indonesia government changed IPB's autonomy status to a state-owned university.

In 2005, IPB applied the [[Minor (academic)|minor]] and [[Major (academic)|major]] system instead of the national curriculum system.&lt;ref name="IPB Undergraduate"&gt;[http://ipb.ac.id/index.php/education/undergraduate IPB Undergraduate system].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.ipb.ac.id/handle/123456789/12503 IPB Undergraduate system evaluation].&lt;/ref&gt; This allow IPB students to take more than one department field.&lt;ref name="IPB Undergraduate" /&gt;

==Faculties and departments==
Institut Pertanian Bogor has agricultural, livestock, veterinary, and life science studies.

IPB consist of nine faculties providing an undergraduate program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=IPB |title=Faculties and Departements |date=25 September 2010 |url=http://ipb.ac.id/offices-and-services/fakdept |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduate and postgraduate programs are managed by a separate graduate school. In 1972, IPB implemented a four-year undergraduate curriculum and, in 1975, opened the first graduate school in Indonesia.

IPB undergraduate new students are required to pass a Common First Year Program (''Tingkat Persiapan Bersama (TPB)'') before entering any faculties or department although they are enrolled as a student of specific faculties and department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visi dan Misi |url=http://tpb.ipb.ac.id/visi-a-misi |publisher=Tingkat Persiapan Bersama IPB |accessdate=25 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927132447/http://tpb.ipb.ac.id/visi-a-misi |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also required to live in dormitories during the first year.

Institut Pertanian Bogor has a diploma program that is separated from the faculties and managed under the Directorate of Diploma Program. Unlike the undergraduate students, a common first year program is unavailable for diploma program students.

===Faculty of Human Ecology===

==== History ====
The [http://fema.ipb.ac.id Faculty of Human Ecology (FEMA)] is the youngest faculty in IPB; it was established on August 2, 2005 by the Rector’s decree no. 112/K13/OT/2005.  his establishment was IPB’s answer to changes that were taking place toward the era of higher education autonomy (IPB BHMN) which granted the university the power to form new study programs, departments, and faculties.

The roots of [http://fema.ipb.ac.id FEMA IPB] were the former Department of Community Nutrition and Family Resource (GMSK) of Faculty of Agriculture; Study Program of Agriculture Extension and Communication of Socioeconomy Department, Faculty of Agriculture; and socioeconomic study programs of all the other faculties in IPB.

The Department of Community Nutrition and Family Resource (GMSK) of Faculty of Agriculture was developed into [http://gizi.fema.ipb.ac.id Department of Community Nutrition (GIZ)] and [http://ikk.fema.ipb.ac.id Department of Family and Consumer Sciences (IKK)]. While the Department of Agricultural Socioeconomy (SOSEK) of Faculty of Agriculture was transformed into [http://skpm.ipb.ac.id Department of Communication and Community Development (KPM)], Department of Agribusiness, and Department of Environmental Resource Economy (ESL). Furthermore; through the clustering process; the Department of Community Nutrition (GIZ), the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences (IKK), and the Department of Communication and Community Development (KPM) merged up to become the Faculty of Human Ecology (FEMA).

[http://fema.ipb.ac.id FEMA IPB] is the first and only faculty of its kind in Indonesia and it is one of the three faculties of human ecology throughout South East Asia. The others are in the College of Human Ecology University of Philippines at Los Banos (UPLB) and the Faculty of Human Ecology, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM).

}}'''BonPatron''' is an online spelling and grammar checker for French. The site also includes guides for grammar, vocabulary, phonetics, and a verb conjugator.

== History ==

BonPatron was created as an academic project in 2001 by Terry Nadasdi ([[University of Alberta]]) and Stéfan Sinclair ([[McGill University]]). BonPatron initially targeted grammatical errors typically made by anglophone learners of French. Its purpose was to see how close a web-based grammar checker could replicate what teachers do when correcting student compositions (repeatedly indicating the same mistakes). BonPatron was initially called LePatron but changed its name in 2007 when it became a joint academic/commercial endeavour.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonpatron.com/Resources/Docs/dublin.pdf|title=Anything I can do, CPU can do better: A comparison of human and computer grammar correction for L2 writing using BonPatron.com|last=Nadasdi|first=Terry|last2=Sinclair|first2=Stéfan|date=|year=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was initially designed for language learners in North America, but it is now used extensively by people whose first language is French, especially in France and Quebec.

In addition to the main grammar checker, other pedagogical resources have been added over the years (e.g.: a grammar guide, a vocabulary guide and a phonetics guide).

== Usage ==

BonPatron has two versions, one that is free and supported by ads (BonPatron.com) and the other that is subscription-based (Pro.BonPatron.com). Both draw on the same error database to identify and explain errors. The main difference is that the subscription-based version accepts longer texts. Native mobile apps are available for iOS and Android, developed in partnership with Alkeo.

In order to use BonPatron, the user supplies a text (typed or pasted from the clipboard) and hits the “Check” button. After doing so, the text is examined for typical errors. Errors will be flagged and relevant feedback will be displayed. BonPatron does not provide automatic correction. Rather, it supplies information to help the learner learn from the mistake. It is in this sense that BonPatron should be viewed as an interactive pedagogical tool rather than an editor or traditional grammar checker.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamel|first=Marie-Josée|date=|year=2008|title=Bon Patron – Parcours pédagogique critique du logiciel|url=|journal=Revue canadienne de linguistique appliquée|volume=11|issue=2|pages=123-131|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BonPatron website averages 4.5 million unique visitors annually and processes an average of 250,000 texts per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonpatron.com/faq/#Q_Who_Uses_BonPatron|title="BonPatron" Online Spelling and Grammar Checker for French as a Second Language|website=bonpatron.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and evaluation ==

BonPatron has been reviewed and evaluated by a number of scholars. The main findings from these evaluations are: a) BonPatron is able to identify approximately 90% of errors typical of learners writing in French&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burston|first=Jack|date=|year=2008|title=Bon Patron: An Online Spelling, Grammar, and Expression Checker|url=|journal=Calico Journal|volume=2|issue=25|pages=337-347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;; b) BonPatron stands apart from other grammar checkers because of its pedagogical design &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=López Santiago|first=Mercedes|date=|year=2016|title=Review of BonPatron.com|url=https://polipapers.upv.es/index.php/eurocall/article/view/6515/7215|journal=The EUROCALL Review|volume=24|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; c) BonPatron promotes learning and its use leads to a reduced number of errors in learner texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bensalem|first=Samra|date=|year=2011|title=Le correcteur orthographique : quel apport pour l´amélioration de la compétence orthographique?|url=https://gerflint.fr/Base/Algerie12/samra_bensalem.pdf|journal=Synergies Algérie|volume=|issue=12|pages=233-240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gauthier|first=Marie|date=|year=2013|title=Anglophone high school boys’ engagement and achievement in editing their French writing using the BonPatronPro|url=https://jcrl.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/jcrl/article/download/16093/pdf|journal=Journal of Classroom Research in Literacy|volume=|issue=6|pages=24-35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brown waste''' is any [[biodegradable waste]] that is predominantly [[Carbon#Compounds|carbon]] based. The term includes such items as grass cuttings, dry leaves, twigs, hay, paper, sawdust, corn cobs, cardboard, pine needles or cones, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://compostguide.com/ How to Make Compost, a Composting Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
Carbon is necessary to [[composting]], which uses a combination of [[green waste]] and brown waste to promote the microbial processes involved in the decomposition process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/organics/Homecompost/ California Integrated Waste Management Board - Home Composting]&lt;/ref&gt; The composting of brown waste [[sustainably]] returns the carbon to the [[carbon cycle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22572">In [[quantum information theory]], the '''classical capacity''' of a [[quantum channel]] is the maximum rate at which classical data can be sent over it error-free in the limit of many uses of the channel. [[Alexander Holevo|Holevo]], Schumacher, and Westmoreland proved the following lower bound on the classical capacity of any quantum channel &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\chi(\mathcal{N}) = \max_{\rho^{XA}} I(X;B)_{\mathcal{N}(\rho)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho^{XA}&lt;/math&gt; is a classical-quantum state of the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;
\rho^{XA} = \sum_x p_X(x) \vert x \rangle \langle x \vert^X \otimes \rho_x^A ,
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;p_X(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a probability distribution, and each &lt;math&gt;\rho_x^A&lt;/math&gt; is a density operator that can be input to the channel &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Achievability using sequential decoding ==

We briefly review the HSW coding theorem (the
statement of the achievability of the [[Holevo information]] rate &lt;math&gt;I(X;B)&lt;/math&gt; for
communicating classical data over a quantum channel). We first review the
minimal amount of quantum mechanics needed for the theorem. We then cover
quantum typicality, and finally we prove the theorem using a recent sequential
decoding technique.

==Review of quantum mechanics==

In order to prove the HSW coding theorem, we really just need a few basic
things from [[quantum mechanics]]. First, a [[quantum state]] is a unit trace,
positive operator known as a [[density operator]]. Usually, we denote it
by &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, etc. The simplest model for a [[quantum channel]]
is known as a classical-quantum channel:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
x\mapsto \rho_{x}.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The meaning of the above notation is that inputting the classical letter &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
at the transmitting end leads to a quantum state &lt;math&gt;\rho_{x}&lt;/math&gt; at the receiving
end. It is the task of the receiver to perform a measurement to determine the
input of the sender. If it is true that the states &lt;math&gt;\rho_{x}&lt;/math&gt; are perfectly
distinguishable from one another (i.e., if they have orthogonal supports such
that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}\,\left\{  \rho_{x}\rho_{x^{\prime}}\right\}  =0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\neq x^{\prime}
&lt;/math&gt;), then the channel is a noiseless channel. We are interested in situations
for which this is not the case. If it is true that the states &lt;math&gt;\rho_{x}&lt;/math&gt; all
commute with one another, then this is effectively identical to the situation
for a classical channel, so we are also not interested in these situations.
So, the situation in which we are interested is that in which the states
&lt;math&gt;\rho_{x}&lt;/math&gt; have overlapping support and are non-commutative.

The most general way to describe a [[quantum measurement]] is with a 
[[positive operator-valued measure]] ([[POVM]]). We usually denote the elements of a POVM as
&lt;math&gt;\left\{  \Lambda_{m}\right\}  _{m}&lt;/math&gt;. These operators should satisfy
positivity and completeness in order to form a valid POVM:
:&lt;math&gt;
\Lambda_{m}   \geq0\ \ \ \ \forall m&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m}\Lambda_{m}  =I.
&lt;/math&gt;
The probabilistic interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]] states that if someone
measures a quantum state &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; using a measurement device corresponding to
the POVM &lt;math&gt;\left\{  \Lambda_{m}\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;, then the probability &lt;math&gt;p\left(
m\right) &lt;/math&gt; for obtaining outcome &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;
p\left(  m\right)  =\text{Tr}\left\{  \Lambda_{m}\rho\right\}  ,
&lt;/math&gt;
and the post-measurement state is
:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_{m}^{\prime}=\frac{1}{p\left(  m\right)  }\sqrt{\Lambda_{m}}\rho
\sqrt{\Lambda_{m}},
&lt;/math&gt;
if the person measuring obtains outcome &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. These rules are sufficient for us
to consider classical communication schemes over cq channels.

==Quantum typicality==

The reader can find a good review of this topic in the article about the [[typical subspace]]. 
==Gentle operator lemma==

The following lemma is important for our proofs. It
demonstrates that a measurement that succeeds with high probability on average
does not disturb the state too much on average:

Lemma: [Winter] Given an
ensemble &lt;math&gt;\left\{  p_{X}\left(  x\right)  ,\rho_{x}\right\}  &lt;/math&gt; with expected
density operator &lt;math&gt;\rho\equiv\sum_{x}p_{X}\left(  x\right)  \rho_{x}&lt;/math&gt;, suppose
that an operator &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;I\geq\Lambda\geq0&lt;/math&gt; succeeds with high
probability on the state &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\text{Tr}\left\{  \Lambda\rho\right\}  \geq1-\epsilon.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Then the subnormalized state &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\Lambda}\rho_{x}\sqrt{\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is close
in expected trace distance to the original state &lt;math&gt;\rho_{x}&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{E}_{X}\left\{  \left\Vert \sqrt{\Lambda}\rho_{X}\sqrt{\Lambda}
-\rho_{X}\right\Vert _{1}\right\}  \leq2\sqrt{\epsilon}.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
(Note that &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert A\right\Vert _{1}&lt;/math&gt; is the nuclear norm of the operator
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert A\right\Vert _{1}\equiv&lt;/math&gt;Tr&lt;math&gt;\left\{  \sqrt{A^{\dagger}
A}\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;.)

The following inequality is useful for us as well. It holds for any operators
&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;0\leq\rho,\sigma,\Lambda\leq I&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\text{Tr}\left\{  \Lambda\rho\right\}  \leq\text{Tr}\left\{  \Lambda
\sigma\right\}  +\left\Vert \rho-\sigma\right\Vert _{1}.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}&lt;/center&gt;
The quantum information-theoretic interpretation of the above inequality is
that the probability of obtaining outcome &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; from a quantum measurement
acting on the state &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is upper bounded by the probability of obtaining
outcome &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; on the state &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; summed with the distinguishability of
the two states &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

==Non-commutative union bound==
Lemma: [Sen's bound] The following bound
holds for a subnormalized state &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;0\leq\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;Tr\left\{  \sigma\right\}  \leq1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, ... , &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{N}&lt;/math&gt; being
projectors:
&lt;math&gt;
\text{Tr}\left\{  \sigma\right\}  -\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi_{N}\cdots\Pi
_{1}\ \sigma\ \Pi_{1}\cdots\Pi_{N}\right\}  \leq2\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N}
\text{Tr}\left\{  \left(  I-\Pi_{i}\right)  \sigma\right\}  },
&lt;/math&gt;

We can think of Sen's bound as a "non-commutative union
bound" because it is analogous to the following union bound
from probability theory:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Pr\left\{  \left(  A_{1}\cap\cdots\cap A_{N}\right)  ^{c}\right\}
=\Pr\left\{  A_{1}^{c}\cup\cdots\cup A_{N}^{c}\right\}  \leq\sum_{i=1}^{N}
\Pr\left\{  A_{i}^{c}\right\}  ,
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, \ldots, &lt;math&gt;A_{N}&lt;/math&gt; are events. The analogous bound for projector
logic would be
:&lt;math&gt;
\text{Tr}\left\{  \left(  I-\Pi_{1}\cdots\Pi_{N}\cdots\Pi_{1}\right)
\rho\right\}  \leq\sum_{i=1}^{N}\text{Tr}\left\{  \left(  I-\Pi_{i}\right)
\rho\right\}  ,
&lt;/math&gt;
if we think of &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{1}\cdots\Pi_{N}&lt;/math&gt; as a projector onto the intersection of
subspaces. Though, the above bound only holds if the projectors &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{1}&lt;/math&gt;,
..., &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{N}&lt;/math&gt; are commuting (choosing &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{1}=\left\vert +\right\rangle
\left\langle +\right\vert &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{2}=\left\vert 0\right\rangle \left\langle
0\right\vert &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\rho=\left\vert 0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right\vert
&lt;/math&gt; gives a counterexample). If the projectors are non-commuting, then Sen's
bound is the next best thing and suffices for our purposes here.

==HSW theorem with the non-commutative union bound==

We now prove the HSW theorem with Sen's non-commutative union bound. We
divide up the proof into a few parts: codebook generation, POVM construction,
and error analysis.

'''Codebook Generation.'''  We first describe how Alice and Bob agree on a
random choice of code. They have the channel &lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\rho_{x}&lt;/math&gt; and a
distribution &lt;math&gt;p_{X}\left(  x\right)  &lt;/math&gt;. They choose &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; classical sequences
&lt;math&gt;x^{n}&lt;/math&gt; according to the IID\ distribution &lt;math&gt;p_{X^{n}}\left(  x^{n}\right)  &lt;/math&gt;.
After selecting them, they label them with indices as &lt;math&gt;\left\{  x^{n}\left(
m\right)  \right\}  _{m\in\left[  M\right]  }&lt;/math&gt;. This leads to the following
quantum codewords:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\rho_{x^{n}\left(  m\right)  }=\rho_{x_{1}\left(  m\right)  }\otimes
\cdots\otimes\rho_{x_{n}\left(  m\right)  }.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The quantum codebook is then &lt;math&gt;\left\{  \rho_{x^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;. The average state of the codebook is then
&lt;center&gt;{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \rho_{X^{n}}\right\}  =\sum_{x^{n}}p_{X^{n}}\left(
x^{n}\right)  \rho_{x^{n}}=\rho^{\otimes n},
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sum_{x}p_{X}\left(  x\right)  \rho_{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''POVM Construction''' . Sens' bound from the above lemma 
suggests a method for Bob to decode a state that Alice transmits. Bob should
first ask "Is the received state in the average typical
subspace?" He can do this operationally by performing a
typical subspace measurement corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\left\{  \Pi_{\rho,\delta}
^{n},I-\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;. Next, he asks in sequential order,
"Is the received codeword in the &lt;math&gt;m^{\text{th}}&lt;/math&gt;
conditionally typical subspace?" This is in some sense
equivalent to the question, "Is the received codeword the
&lt;math&gt;m^{\text{th}}&lt;/math&gt; transmitted codeword?" He can ask these
questions operationally by performing the measurements corresponding to the
conditionally typical projectors &lt;math&gt;\left\{  \Pi_{\rho_{x^{n}\left(  m\right)
},\delta},I-\Pi_{\rho_{x^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;.

Why should this sequential decoding scheme work well? The reason is that the
transmitted codeword lies in the typical subspace on average:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi_{\rho,\delta}\ \rho_{X^{n}
}\right\}  \right\}    =\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi_{\rho,\delta}\ \mathbb{E}
_{X^{n}}\left\{  \rho_{X^{n}}\right\}  \right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; =\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi_{\rho,\delta}\ \rho^{\otimes n}\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \geq1-\epsilon,&lt;/math&gt;
where the inequality follows from (\ref{eq:1st-typ-prop}). Also, the
projectors &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{\rho_{x^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}&lt;/math&gt;
are "good detectors" for the states &lt;math&gt;\rho_{x^{n}\left(  m\right)
}&lt;/math&gt; (on average) because the following condition holds from conditional quantum
typicality:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}},\delta}
\ \rho_{X^{n}}\right\}  \right\}  \geq1-\epsilon.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''Error Analysis'''. The probability of detecting the &lt;math&gt;m^{\text{th}}&lt;/math&gt;
codeword correctly under our sequential decoding scheme is equal to
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\hat{\Pi}
_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m-1\right)  },\delta}\cdots\hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(
1\right)  },\delta}\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\ \rho_{x^{n}\left(  m\right)
}\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\ \hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  1\right)  },\delta
}\cdots\hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m-1\right)  },\delta}\Pi_{\rho
_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\right\}  ,
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where we make the abbreviation &lt;math&gt;\hat{\Pi}\equiv I-\Pi&lt;/math&gt;. (Observe that we
project into the average typical subspace just once.) Thus, the probability of
an incorrect detection for the &lt;math&gt;m^{\text{th}}&lt;/math&gt; codeword is given by
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
1-\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\hat{\Pi}
_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m-1\right)  },\delta}\cdots\hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(
1\right)  },\delta}\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\ \rho_{x^{n}\left(  m\right)
}\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\ \hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  1\right)  },\delta
}\cdots\hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m-1\right)  },\delta}\Pi_{\rho
_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\right\}  ,
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and the average error probability of this scheme is equal to
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
1-\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)
},\delta}\hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m-1\right)  },\delta}\cdots\hat{\Pi
}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  1\right)  },\delta}\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\ \rho
_{x^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\ \hat{\Pi}_{\rho
_{X^{n}\left(  1\right)  },\delta}\cdots\hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(
m-1\right)  },\delta}\Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\right\}  .
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Instead of analyzing the average error probability, we analyze the expectation
of the average error probability, where the expectation is with respect to the
random choice of code:
&lt;center&gt;{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
1-\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi
_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(
m-1\right)  },\delta}\cdots\hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  1\right)  },\delta
}\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\ \rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta
}^{n}\ \hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  1\right)  },\delta}\cdots\hat{\Pi}
_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m-1\right)  },\delta}\Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)
},\delta}\right\}  \right\}  .
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}&lt;/center&gt;

Our first step is to apply Sen's bound to the above quantity. But before doing
so, we should rewrite the above expression just slightly, by observing that
:&lt;math&gt;
1   =\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{
\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\right\}  \right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; =\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi
_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\right\}  +\text{Tr}\left\{
\hat{\Pi}_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\right\}  \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; =\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi
_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\right\}
\right\}  +\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \hat{\Pi}_{\rho,\delta}
^{n}\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\right\}
\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; =\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi
_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\right\}
\right\}  +\text{Tr}\left\{  \hat{\Pi}_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\rho^{\otimes
n}\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \leq\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{
\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\Pi_{\rho,\delta}
^{n}\right\}  \right\}  +\epsilon
&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting into ({{EquationNote|3}}) (and forgetting about the small
&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; term for now) gives an upper bound of
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi
_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\right\}
\right\} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
-\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi
_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(
m-1\right)  },\delta}\cdots\hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  1\right)  },\delta
}\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\ \rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta
}^{n}\ \hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  1\right)  },\delta}\cdots\hat{\Pi}
_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m-1\right)  },\delta}\Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)
},\delta}\right\}  \right\}  .
&lt;/math&gt;
We then apply Sen's bound to this expression with &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\Pi_{\rho,\delta
}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; and the sequential
projectors as &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\Pi}
_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m-1\right)  },\delta}&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;\hat{\Pi}_{\rho
_{X^{n}\left(  1\right)  },\delta}&lt;/math&gt;. This gives the upper bound
&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}2\left[  \text{Tr}\left\{
\left(  I-\Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\right)  \Pi_{\rho
,\delta}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\right\}
+\sum_{i=1}^{m-1}\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  i\right)  },\delta
}\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\Pi_{\rho,\delta}
^{n}\right\}  \right]  ^{1/2}\right\}  .
&lt;/math&gt;
Due to concavity of the square root, we can bound this expression from above
by
:&lt;math&gt;
 2\left[  \mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{
\left(  I-\Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\right)  \Pi_{\rho
,\delta}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\right\}
+\sum_{i=1}^{m-1}\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  i\right)  },\delta
}\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\Pi_{\rho,\delta}
^{n}\right\}  \right\}  \right]  ^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \leq2\left[  \mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{
\left(  I-\Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\right)  \Pi_{\rho
,\delta}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\right\}
+\sum_{i\neq m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  i\right)  },\delta
}\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\Pi_{\rho,\delta}
^{n}\right\}  \right\}  \right]  ^{1/2},
&lt;/math&gt;
where the second bound follows by summing over all of the codewords not equal
to the &lt;math&gt;m^{\text{th}}&lt;/math&gt; codeword (this sum can only be larger).

We now focus exclusively on showing that the term inside the square root can
be made small. Consider the first term:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \left(
I-\Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\right)  \Pi_{\rho,\delta}
^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\right\}  \right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \leq\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \left(
I-\Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\right)  \rho_{X^{n}\left(
m\right)  }\right\}  +\left\Vert \rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }-\Pi
_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\Pi_{\rho,\delta}
^{n}\right\Vert _{1}\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \leq\epsilon+2\sqrt{\epsilon}.
&lt;/math&gt;
where the first inequality follows from ({{EquationNote|1}}) and the
second inequality follows from the gentle operator lemma and the
properties of unconditional and conditional typicality. Consider now the
second term and the following chain of inequalities:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum_{i\neq m}\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi_{\rho
_{X^{n}\left(  i\right)  },\delta}\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\ \rho_{X^{n}\left(
m\right)  }\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\right\}  \right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  =\sum_{i\neq m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \Pi
_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  i\right)  },\delta}\right\}  \ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}
^{n}\ \mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\right\}
\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; =\sum_{i\neq m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \Pi
_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  i\right)  },\delta}\right\}  \ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}
^{n}\ \rho^{\otimes n}\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \leq\sum_{i\neq m}2^{-n\left[  H\left(  B\right)  -\delta\right]
}\ \text{Tr}\left\{  \mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(
i\right)  },\delta}\right\}  \ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;
The first equality follows because the codewords &lt;math&gt;X^{n}\left(  m\right)  &lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;X^{n}\left(  i\right)  &lt;/math&gt; are independent since they are different. The second
equality follows from ({{EquationNote|2}}). The first inequality follows from
(\ref{eq:3rd-typ-prop}). Continuing, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \leq\sum_{i\neq m}2^{-n\left[  H\left(  B\right)  -\delta\right]
}\ \mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(
i\right)  },\delta}\right\}  \right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \leq\sum_{i\neq m}2^{-n\left[  H\left(  B\right)  -\delta\right]
}\ 2^{n\left[  H\left(  B|X\right)  +\delta\right]  }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  =\sum_{i\neq m}2^{-n\left[  I\left(  X;B\right)  -2\delta\right]  }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \leq M\ 2^{-n\left[  I\left(  X;B\right)  -2\delta\right]  }.
&lt;/math&gt;
The first inequality follows from &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\leq I&lt;/math&gt; and exchanging
the trace with the expectation. The second inequality follows from
(\ref{eq:2nd-cond-typ}). The next two are straightforward.

Putting everything together, we get our final bound on the expectation of the
average error probability:
:&lt;math&gt;
1-\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\left\{  \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m}\text{Tr}\left\{  \Pi
_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  },\delta}\hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(
m-1\right)  },\delta}\cdots\hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  1\right)  },\delta
}\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta}^{n}\ \rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)  }\ \Pi_{\rho,\delta
}^{n}\ \hat{\Pi}_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  1\right)  },\delta}\cdots\hat{\Pi}
_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m-1\right)  },\delta}\Pi_{\rho_{X^{n}\left(  m\right)
},\delta}\right\}  \right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\leq\epsilon+2\left[  \left(  \epsilon+2\sqrt{\epsilon}\right)
+M\ 2^{-n\left[  I\left(  X;B\right)  -2\delta\right]  }\right]  ^{1/2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, as long as we choose &lt;math&gt;M=2^{n\left[  I\left(  X;B\right)  -3\delta
\right]  }&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a code with vanishing error probability.

The '''[http://www.cfsp.org/ Consortium on Financial Systems and Poverty]''' (CFSP) is a private economic research consortium dedicated to studying the interaction of financial systems and poverty, using a variety of economic approaches in a range of developing countries.

The CFSP was established in 2009 by a grant to the University of Chicago from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Grants-2009/Pages/University-of-Chicago-OPP51935.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314162337/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Grants-2009/Pages/University-of-Chicago-OPP51935.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Robert M.

[[File:CILII697.JPG|thumb|200px|Inscription II 697 in the CIL: in the wall of a building in [[Cáceres, Spain]].]]
The '''''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum''''' ('''''CIL''''') is a comprehensive collection of ancient [[Latin]] [[inscription]]s. It forms an authoritative source for documenting the surviving [[epigraphy]] of [[classical antiquity]]. Public and personal inscriptions throw light on all aspects of Roman life and history. The ''Corpus'' continues to be updated in new editions and supplements.

CIL also refers to the organization within the [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] responsible for collecting data on and publishing the Latin inscriptions. It was founded in 1853 by [[Theodor Mommsen]] and is the first and major organization aiming at a comprehensive survey.

==Aim==
The ''CIL'' collects all Latin inscriptions from the whole territory of the [[Roman Empire]], ordering them geographically and systematically. The earlier volumes collected and published authoritative versions of all inscriptions known at the time—most of these had been previously published in a wide range of publications. The descriptions include images of the original inscription if available, drawings showing the letters in their original size and position, and an interpretation reconstructing abbreviations and missing words, along with discussion of issues and problems. The language of the ''CIL'' is Latin.

==Beginnings==
In 1847 a committee was created in [[Berlin]] with the aim of publishing an organized collection of Latin inscriptions, which had previously been described piecemeal by hundreds of scholars over the preceding centuries. The leading figure of this committee was [[Theodor Mommsen]]&lt;ref name="CILhistory"&gt;See the CIL site under External links below.&lt;/ref&gt; (who wrote several of the volumes covering [[Italy]]). Much of the work involved personal inspections of sites and monuments in an attempt to replicate the original as much as possible. In those cases where a previously cited inscription could no longer be found, the authors tried to get an accurate reading by comparing the versions of the published inscription in the works of previous authors who had seen the original. The first volume appeared in 1853.

==Current status==
The ''CIL'' presently consists of 17 volumes in about 70 parts, recording approximately 180,000 inscriptions. Thirteen supplementary volumes have plates and special indices.&lt;ref name="CILhistory"/&gt; The first volume, in two sections, covered the oldest inscriptions, to the end of the [[Roman Republic]]; volumes II to XIV are divided geographically, according to the regions where the inscriptions were found. The other volumes cover other topics. Volume XVII, for instance, is entirely devoted to [[milestone]]s. A volume XVIII is planned, which will contain the ''Carmina Latina Epigraphica'' (Latin verse inscriptions). A two-volume "Index of Numbers", correlating inscription numbers with volume numbers, was published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Andreas|editor-last=Fassbender|year=2003|series=CIL Auctarium Series Nova|title=Index Numerorum|volume=Erster Band, Zweiter Band|isbn=3-11-017936-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften]] continues to update and reprint the ''CIL.''

The concept was popularized by [[Carl Sagan]] in his book ''[[The Dragons of Eden]]'' (1977) and on his television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa1ImgOcOPM&amp;t=52m55s Cosmos, episode 1 (1980)]&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan goes on to extend the comparison in terms of surface area, explaining that if the Cosmic Calendar is scaled to the size of a football field, then "all of human history would occupy an area the size of [his] hand".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa1ImgOcOPM&amp;t=53m38s Episode 1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean (Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Carl Sagan)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--is this the article about Sagan's "Cosmic Calendar" concept, or is this an original publication of this genre?
The latter belongs on wikibooks, or conceivably could be a list article--&gt;

The Cosmic Calendar shows the time-scale relationship of the universe and all events on Earth as plotted along a single 12-month, 365-day, year:

[[File:Jesuits at Akbar's court.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar the Great]] (r. 1556-1605) holds a religious assembly in the [[Ibadat Khana]] (House of Worship) in [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; the two men dressed in black are the [[Jesuit]] missionaries [[Rodolfo Acquaviva]] and [[Francisco Henriques (missionary)|Francisco Henriques]].  Illustration to the [[Akbarnama]], miniature painting by [[Nar Singh]], ca. 1605]]
The '''''Dabestān-e Mazāheb''''', also transliterated as '''''Dabistān-i Mazāhib''''' ({{lang-fa|دبستان مذاهب}}) "School of Religions", is an examination and comparison of [[South Asia]]n religions and sects of the mid-17th century. The work is written in Persian, probably having been composed in about 1655 CE.

The ''Dabistan-e Madahib'' is best known for its chapter on the [[Din-i Ilahi|Dīn-i Ilāhī]], the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion propounded by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar|Jalāl ud-Dīn Muḥammad Akbar]] ("Akbar the Great") after 1581 and is possibly the most reliable account of the [[Ibadat Khana|''Ibādat Khāna'']] discussions that led up to this.

This work was first printed by Nazar Ashraf in a very accurate edition in movable type at Calcutta in 1809 (an offset reprint of this edition was published by Ali Asghar Mustafawi from Teheran in 1982). A lithographed edition was published by Ibrahim bin Nur Muhammad from Bombay in AH 1292 (1875). In 1877, Munshi Nawal Kishore published another Lithographed edition from Lucknow. The distinguished Persian scholar Francis Gladwin translated the chapter on the Persians into English and published it from Calcutta in 1789. A German version by E. Dalburg from Wurzburg was published in 1809. The chapter on the Raushanyas was translated into English by J. Leyden for the ''Asiatic Researches'', xi, Calcutta. The entire work was translated into English by [[David Shea (linguist)|David Shea]] and Anthony Troyer under the title, ''The Dabistan or School of Manners'' (1843) in three volumes from London.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, M. Athar (2008). ''Mughal India'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-569661-1}}, pp.216-28&lt;/ref&gt; 

The critical English-language edition by David Shea and Anthony Troyer in 1843 is slightly flawed since the translators were not well-versed in much of the subject matter. The editors, who were not certain of the identity of the author, suggest a certain Muhsin Fani and propose 1670 as his date of death. They furthermore stated that he was "of the philosophic sect of [[Sufi]]s", but the 1993 edition of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'' suggests that the author was most likely a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]. The present [[Persian language|Persian]] edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of [[Azar Kayvan]], '''Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar'''. The author may have belonged to a Persian tradition (Sipásíán) that can be considered to be heterodox relative to orthodox Zoroastrianism.

The author describes that he spent time in [[Patna]], [[Kashmir]], [[Lahore]], [[Surat]] and [[Srikakulam]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]]). He is perceived to have been a person of great scholarship and curiosity, and extremely open-minded for the context of his time. He mentions numerous interviews with scholars of numerous faiths, which suggests that he was well connected, and so qualified to report on the Dīn-i Ilāhī.

According to ''The Jew in the Lotus'' by Rodger Kamenetz, a ''Dabistan'' was commissioned by a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] mystic prince, [[Dara Shikoh]]. The section on Judaism consists of translations by a Persian Jewish Sufi Muslim convert, [[Sarmad Kashani]], and his Hindu disciple from [[Sindh]].&lt;ref&gt;Jews and Judaism at the Court of the Moghul Emperors in Medieval India, Walter J. Fischel, Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 18, (1948 - 1949), pp. 137-177&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Fischel notes: {{Quote|Through the medium of the ''Dabistan'' Sarmad thus became the channel through which Jewish ideas, though with a Sufic blending, penetrated into the religious fabric of the India of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Kamenetz p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;}} An English version of the ''Dabistan'' by David Shea (1843) is available at the Digital Library of India IISc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/data/upload/0010/694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719101952/http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=%2Fdata%2Fupload%2F0010%2F694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689 |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author's perspective==

Although the author spent most of life in South Asia, he regarded himself as a [[Persian people|Persian]]. However his perspective of the Hindus, and of other religions was unusually liberal. He writes:&lt;ref&gt;DABISTÁN, OR SCHOOL OF MANNERS. TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL PERSIAN, BY DAVID SHEA AND ANTHONY TROYER,1843.&lt;/ref&gt;

:As inconstant fortune had torn away the author from the shores of Persia, and made him the associate of the believers in transmigration and those who addressed their prayers to idols and images and worshipped demons, therefore the tenets held by this most subtle class of reasoners come to be considered next after those of the Parsees.

:... According to these sectaries, the worship offered to the forms of Mahadeo and Naráyan, and to the statues of the other spiritual beings, is highly to be commended. Strangers to their faith suppose them to look upon the idol as God, which is by no means the case, their belief being as follows: “The idol is merely a Kiblah, and they adore under that particular form, the Being who has neither accident nor form.” ...

: Rai Manuhar Kuchwáhhah has said:

::“O Moslem! if the Kâbah be the object of thy worship,
::Why dost thou reproach the adorers of idols?”

He personally met many scholars of different faiths. For example, about the [[Jainism|Jains]] he writes:

:The author of this book affirms he has seen a great number of Srivaras &lt;ref&gt;Sevada implies a Jain monk of the [[Shvetambara]] order, from Sanskrit Shvetapata.&lt;/ref&gt; and their followers. From them he knew Meher chand, a Lúnú,&lt;ref&gt;Lunia means someone belonging to the [[Lonka Gachchha]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 1056 of the Hejira (1646 A. D.), in Dotárah, which is under the dominion of Jodpur Márawár, he found also Síva rama, a Pujári, in Mirta, which place belongs to Marawar, and one named Jagna, a Banian, in Ráwel Pandi: he was adorned with all the good qualities of Jatis. When he saw a bird in the hands of a fowler, he bought it of him and set it free. This sect do whatever they can for the liberation of living beings.

:[[Hafez|Hafiz]] Shirázi says:

::“Avoid hurting any living animal, and do whatever thou likest,
::For in my book of laws there is no crime but this.”

[[File:Persians (Parsees) in Bombay 1873.jpg|thumb|200px|right|"Parsis of [[Bombay]]" with traditional [[Parsi hat]]s, a wood engraving, ''ca.'' 1878]]
He observes that while Hindus dress following their own custom, the non-Muslims of Iran and Turan pass themselves off as Muslims, while practicing their faith in secret:

:... there are Samradíán, Khodaníán, Radián, Shíderangíán, Pâikeríán, Mílánían, Aláríán, Shídábíán, Akhshían, and [[Mazdak]]ían, who are dispersed in Iran and Turan, and all appear in the dress of Musulmans, although in secret they follow each the path of their own chosen faith; in the same manner various sects are also established in Hindostan, but they do not appear in the dress of Musulmans.

He describes the disputations in [[Akbar]]'s [[Ibadat Khana]] in detail, as if he had been there:

:A learned philosopher came into the hall, where Hindus also were present, and three other learned men; a Musulman, a Nazarene, and a Jew: these were summoned, and ranged in opposition to the learned philosopher.The latter opened the discussion in this manner: “The divine mission of your prophets has not been proved, for several reasons: the first is, that whatever the prophet says ought to be conformable to reason; the second is, that he ought to be free from crime, and not hurtful to other beings. But Moses, according to the opinion of the Jews, was brought up by Pharâoh, and yet he caused him by a stratagem to be drowned in the waters of the Nile,... Jesus permitted the killing and ill using of animals. And Muhammed himself attacked the forces and caravans of the Koreish; he shed blood, nay, with his own hand put to death animated beings.

:... Now the Christian said: “The Messiah was born without a father.” The doctor replied: “You yourselves say that Joseph, the carpenter, had taken Mary to wife; how can it be made out that Jesus was not the son of Joseph?” The Nazarene was reduced to silence.

He describes and defends the liberal views of Akbar:

:His Majesty, Akbar, as he was ordered by God, used to read prayers, containing the praise of the sun, in the Persian, Hindi, Turkish, and Arabic languages, among which all was one prayer, which is proper to the Hindus, and which they sing at midnight and at sun-rise. Besides, the emperor forbade his subjects to kill cows and to eat their flesh; .... The Hindus say also that, as many advantages are derived from the cow, it is not right to kill it. The Yezdánian maintained that it is tyranny to kill harmless animals ...

The European Certification of Informatics Professionals ('''EUCIP''') is a [[professional certification]] and competency development scheme, aimed at [[Information technology|informatics]] professionals and practitioners. EUCIP, which originated with the Council of European Professional Informatics Societies, is offered in a range of [[Europe]]an countries through national computer societies. The EUCIP certifications are maintained by [[ECDL Foundation]].

== History of EUCIP &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=CEPIS UPGRADE|date=August 2008|volume=IX|issue=4|url=http://www.cepis.org/upgrade/files/franza-08-IV.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ==
The evolution of EUCIP stems from a series of earlier projects in the area of [[Information technology|IT]] competence. These include the EISS (European Informatics Skills Structures) and EICL (European Informatics Continuous Learning) (circa 1995-1999), EPIC (European Professional Informatics Certificate) in 2000, which aimed at providing a basic level of IT professional certification, followed by EPICS (European Professional Informatics Certificate Service) in 2001–2003, which saw the development of what was soon to become the EUCIP Core [[syllabus]]. 

This EPICS activity involved input from several European Subject Matter Experts. In addition, the EPICS project applied for [[financial support]] from the [[European Union|EU]], through the TEN-telecom program. As a result of this funding, a market validation project took place to prepare a business plan for a limited market in six European countries.

The name was changed to EUCIP in late 2001 and a EUCIP central organisation was created as part of CEPIS. An initial meeting of [[early adopter]]s was held in [[Athens]] in January 2002 and the work of creating the EUCIP product (based on the initial activities from the EPICS) began. During 2002, a test base was developed and extensive piloting activities took place in [[Italy]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Estonia]] and [[Germany]]. Later in the year, the working groups which had been involved in designing the product were transformed into a more structured form and EUCIP moved into office space in the BCS ([[British Computer Society]])  headquarters in [[Swindon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Computer Society|url=http://www.bcs.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first official tests took place in Italy in July 2003, soon followed by Norway. During 2004 CEPIS decided to hand over operation and maintenance support for EUCIP to [[ECDL Foundation]]. The involvement of ECDL Foundation has led to further revision to the EUCIP programmes.

== Candidates ==
The EUCIP certification is available in 8 European countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cepis.org|url=http://www.cepis.org/index.jsp?p=1116&amp;n=1124|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with testing being administered in competence centres in each these countries for a fee. ECDL Foundation markets the EUCIP programme to practitioners working in industry, government and public organisations. EUCIP aims to create a pan-European skills standard for ICT Professionals, helps to close the IT skills gap, enhance worker mobility, and increases the labour [[market value]] of certified practitioners.

== EUCIP Core ==
According to ECDL Foundation, the EUCIP Core provides students with a solid foundation for all types of ICT related work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EUCIP Core|url=http://www.cepis.org/index.jsp?p=1120&amp;n=1121|work=Cepis.org|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve a EUCIP certification, the candidate must successfully pass a test in all three knowledge areas. These are:

'''A) Plan Area: The Use and Management of Information Systems'''

This area refers to requirements analysis and planning in the use of ICT within an organisation. It is therefore directly concerned with management processes and defining requirements within a strategic perspective.

'''B) Build Area: Development and Integration of Information Systems'''

This area includes processes for specification, development and testing, and maintenance of Information Systems. It deals with methodological and technological issues related to development processes.

'''C) Operate Area: Operation and Support of Information Systems'''

This area concerns installation, supervision and maintenance of ICT systems. Essential topics include: [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] concepts, management of networks, service delivery and support, and security.

== EUCIP Professional ==
EUCIP Professional demands advanced competence in a particular role. The professional level is based on a specialised competence that a candidate may earn by working through a variety of educational modules and by gaining practical experience. There are 21 professional profiles to choose from:
* IS Analyst

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13638">'''Exploratory search''' is a specialization of information exploration which represents the activities carried out by searchers who are:&lt;ref&gt;Ryen W. White and Resa A. Roth (2009). ''Exploratory Search: Beyond the Query-Response Paradigm'', San Rafael, CA: Morgan and Claypool.&lt;/ref&gt;
* unfamiliar with the domain of their goal (i.e. need to learn about the topic in order to understand how to achieve their goal)
* or unsure about the ways to achieve their goals (either the technology or the process)
* or unsure about their goals in the first place.

Consequently, exploratory search covers a broader class of activities than typical [[information retrieval]], such as investigating, evaluating, comparing, and synthesizing, where new information is sought in a defined conceptual area; exploratory&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[exploratory data analysis|data analysis]] is another example of an information exploration activity. Typically, therefore, such users generally combine querying and browsing strategies to foster learning and investigation.

==History==
Exploratory search is a topic that has grown from the fields of [[information retrieval]] and [[information seeking]] but has become more concerned with alternatives to the kind of search that has received the majority of focus (returning the most relevant documents to a [[Google]]-like keyword search). The research is motivated by questions like "what if the user doesn't know which keywords to use?" or "what if the user isn't looking for a single answer?". Consequently, research has begun to focus on defining the broader set of ''information behaviors'' in order to learn about the situations when a user is, or feels, limited by only having the ability to perform a keyword search.

In the last few years,{{When|date=April 2016}} a series of workshops has been held at various related and key events. In 2005, the Exploratory Search Interfaces workshop focused on beginning to define some of the key challenges in the field.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/~ryenw/xsi/index.html|title=HCIL SOH 2005 Workshop on Exploratory Search Interfaces|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then a series of other workshops has been held at related conferences: Evaluating Exploratory Search&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/~ryenw/eess/index.html|title=SIGIR 2006 Workshop - Evaluating Exploratory Search Systems|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at SIGIR06&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigir2006.org|title=Sigir 2006|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Exploratory Search and HCI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/~ryenw/esi/index.html|title=CHI 2007 Workshop - Exploratory Search and HCI|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at CHI07&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chi2007.org|title=CHI 2007 Reach Beyond - welcome|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in order to meet with the experts in [[human–computer interaction]]).

In March 2008, an ''Information Processing and Management'' special issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03064573|title=Information Processing &amp; Management|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryen W. White, Gary Marchionini, Gheorghe Muresan (2008). ''Evaluating exploratory search systems: Introduction to special topic issue of information processing and management'' Vol. 44, Issue 2, (2008), pp.&amp;nbsp;433–436&lt;/ref&gt; focused particularly on the challenges of evaluating exploratory search, given the reduced assumptions that can be made about scenarios of use.

In June 2008, the [[National Science Foundation]] sponsored an invitational workshop to identify a research agenda for exploratory search and similar fields for the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ils.unc.edu/ISSS_workshop/|title=Moved|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research challenges==

===Important scenarios===
With the majority of research in the [[information retrieval]] community focusing on typical keyword search scenarios, one challenge for exploratory search is to further understand the scenarios of use for when keyword search is not sufficient. An example scenario, often used to motivate the research by mSpace,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mspace.fm mSpace]&lt;/ref&gt; states: if a user does not know much about classical music, how should they even begin to find a piece that they might like. Similarly, for patients or their carers, if they don't know the right keywords for their health problems, how can they effectively find useful health information for themselves?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pang|first1=PCI|last2=Verspoor|first2=K|last3=Chang|first3=S|last4=Pearce|first4=J|title=Conceptualising health information seeking behaviours and exploratory search: result of a qualitative study|journal=Health and Technology|date=2015|volume=5|issue=1|pages=45-55|doi=10.1007/s12553-015-0096-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Designing new interfaces===
With one of the motivations being to support users when keyword search is not enough, some research has focused on identifying alternative user interfaces and interaction models that support the user in different ways. An example is [[Faceted classification|faceted search]] which presents diverse category-style options to the users, so that they can choose from a list instead of guess a possible keyword query.

Many of the [[human–computer information retrieval|interactive forms of search]], including [[faceted browser]]s, are being considered for their support of exploratory search conditions.

Computational cognitive models of exploratory search have been developed to capture the cognitive complexities involved in exploratory search. Model-based dynamic presentation of information cues are proposed to facilitate exploratory search performance.&lt;ref&gt;Fu, W.-T., Kannampalill, T. G., &amp; Kang, R. (2010). [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1719970.1719998 Facilitating exploratory search by model-based navigational cues.] In Proceedings of the ACM International conference on Intelligent User Interface. 199–208.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluating interfaces===
As the tasks and goals involved with exploratory search are largely undefined or unpredictable, it is very hard to evaluate systems with the measures often used in information retrieval. Accuracy was typically used to show that a user had found a correct answer, but when the user is trying to summarize a domain of information, the ''correct'' answer is near impossible to identify, if not entirely subjective (for example: possible hotels to stay in Paris). In exploration, it is also arguable that spending more time (where time efficiency is typically desirable) researching a topic shows that a system provides increased support for investigation. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, giving study participants a well specified task could immediately prevent them from exhibiting exploratory behavior.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Models of exploratory search behavior===
There have been recent{{When|date=April 2016}} attempts to develop a process model of exploratory search behavior, especially in social information system (e.g., see [[models of collaborative tagging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process model assumes that user-generated information cues, such as social tags, can act as navigational cues that facilitate exploration of information that others have found and shared with other users on a social information system (such as [[social bookmarking]] system). These models provided extension to existing process model of information search that characterizes information-seeking behavior in traditional fact-retrievals using search engines.&lt;ref&gt;

Such predictive user modeling, also referred as intent modeling, can help users to get accustomed to a body of [[domain knowledge]] and help users to make sense of the potential directions to be explored around their initial, often vague, expression of information needs.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''exposome''' encompasses the totality of human environmental (i.e. non-genetic) [[Exposure assessment|exposure]]s from conception onwards, complementing the [[genome]],  first proposed in 2005 by a [[Epidemiology of cancer|cancer epidemiologist]]. As of 2016 it may not be possible to measure or model.

==Definition==
The exposome was first proposed in 2005 by  [[Epidemiology of cancer|cancer epidemiologist]] Christopher Paul Wild in an article entitled "Complementing the genome with an "exposome": the outstanding challenge of environmental exposure measurement in molecular epidemiology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wild |first=CP |title= Complementing the genome with an "exposome": the outstanding challenge of environmental exposure measurement in molecular epidemiology |journal= Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention |date= Aug 2005 |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=1847–50 |pmid= 16103423 |doi= 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the exposome and how to assess it has led to lively discussions with varied views in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Rappaport SM, Smith MT |year=2010 |title= Epidemiology.

In his 2005 article, Wild stated, "At its most complete, the exposome encompasses life-course [[environmental exposure]]s (including [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] factors), from the [[prenatal]] period onwards." The concept was first proposed to draw attention to the need for better and more complete environmental exposure data for causal research, in order to balance the investment in genetics. According to Wild,  even incomplete versions of the exposome could be useful to [[epidemiology]]. In 2012, Wild outlined methods, including personal sensors, [[biomarker]]s, and '[[omics]]' technologies, to better define the exposome.&lt;ref name="Wild 24–32"/&gt; He described three overlapping domains within the exposome:
# a general [[external environment]] including the [[urban environment]], [[education]], [[climate]] factors, [[social capital]], [[stress (psychological)|stress]],
# a specific external environment with specific [[contaminant]]s, [[radiation]],  [[infection]]s, [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] factors (e.g. [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]]), [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[physical activity]], etc.
# an internal environment to include internal biological factors such as [[metabolic]] factors, [[hormones]], [[gut microflora]], [[inflammation]], [[oxidative stress]].
In late 2013, this definition was explained in greater depth in the first book on the exposome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Gary Miller |isbn= 978-0124172173

In 2014, the same author revised the definition to include the body's response with its endogenous metabolic processes which alter the processing of chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Miller Gary W. |author2=Jones Dean P. |date= January 2014 |title= The Nature of Nurture: Refining the Definition of the Exposome |journal= [[Toxicological Sciences]] |volume=137 |issue=1 |pages= 1–2 |pmid= 24213143 |doi= 10.1093/toxsci/kft251 | pmc=3871934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
For complex disorders, specific genetic causes appear to account for only 10-30% of the disease incidence, but there has been no standard or systematic way to measure the influence of environmental exposures. Some studies into the interaction of genetic and environmental factors in the incidence of [[diabetes]] have demonstrated that "environment-wide association studies" (EWAS, or exposome-wide association studies) may be feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=CJ|author2=Bhattacharya, J |author3=Butte, AJ |title=An Environment-Wide Association Study (EWAS) on type 2 diabetes mellitus.|journal=PLoS ONE|date=May 20, 2010| volume=5| issue=5| pages=e10746| pmid=20505766|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010746|pmc=2873978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=CJ|author2=Chen, R |author3=Kodama, K |author4=Ioannidis, JP |author5= Butte, AJ |title=Systematic identification of interaction effects between genome- and environment-wide associations in type 2 diabetes mellitus| url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/676/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00439-012-1258-z.pdf?auth66=1425526047_d503d7888be4f8f7c25b85cac0e83d09&amp;ext=.pdf | journal=Human Genetics| date=20 January 2013| pmid=23334806|accessdate=4 March 2015 |doi=10.1007/s00439-012-1258-z |volume=132 |issue=5 |pages=495–508 |pmc=3625410}}{{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not clear what data sets are most appropriate to represent the value of "E".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith Martyn T. |author2=Rappaport Stephen M. | date = August 2009 | title = Building Exposure Biology Centers to Put the E into "G × E" Interaction Studies | journal = [[Environmental Health Perspectives]] | volume = 117 | issue = 8| pages = A334–A335 | pmc=2721881 | pmid=19672377 | doi=10.1289/ehp.12812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research initiatives==
As of 2016, it may not be possible to measure or model the full exposome, but several European projects have started to make first attempts.
In 2012, the [[European Commission]] awarded two large grants to pursue exposome-related research.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/daily-dose-of-toxics-to-be-tracked-1.11901 |title=Daily dose of toxics to be tracked |journal=Nature |volume=491 |issue=7426 |pages=647 |last1=Callaway|first1=  Ewen |date=27 November 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2013|doi=10.1038/491647a |pmid=23192121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HELIX project at the [[Barcelona]]-based Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology was launched around 2014, and aimed to develop an early-life exposome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vrijheid |first1=M |last2=Slama |first2=R |last3=Robinson |first3=O |last4=Chatzi |first4=L |last5=Coen |first5=M |last6=van den Hazel |first6=P |last7=Thomsen |first7=C |last8=Wright |first8=J |last9=Athersuch |first9=TJ |last10=Avellana |first10=N |last11=Basagaña |first11=X |last12=Brochot |first12=C |last13=Bucchini |first13=L |last14=Bustamante |first14=M |last15=Carracedo |first15=A |last16=Casas |first16=M |last17=Estivill |first17=X |last18=Fairley |first18=L |last19=van Gent |first19=D |last20=Gonzalez |first20=JR |last21=Granum |first21=B |last22=Gražulevičienė |first22=R |last23=Gutzkow |first23=KB |last24=Julvez |first24=J |last25=Keun |first25=HC |last26=Kogevinas |first26=M |last27=McEachan |first27=RR |last28=Meltzer |first28=HM |last29=Sabidó |first29=E |last30=Schwarze |first30=PE |last31=Siroux |first31=V |last32=Sunyer |first32=J |last33=Want |first33=EJ |last34=Zeman |first34=F |last35=Nieuwenhuijsen |first35=MJ |title=The human early-life exposome (HELIX): project rationale and design. |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |date=June 2014 |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=535–44 |doi=10.1289/ehp.1307204 |pmid=24610234 |pmc=4048258}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A second project, Exposomics, based at [[Imperial College London]], launched in 2012, aimed to use smartphones utilizine GPS and environmental sensors to assess exposures.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exposomicsproject.eu/ About Exposomics] EU&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
In late 2013, a major initiative called the "Health and Environment-Wide Associations based on Large Scale population Surveys" or HEALS, began. Touted as the largest environmental health-related study in Europe, HEALS proposes to adopt a paradigm defined by interactions between DNA sequence, epigenetic DNA modifications, gene expression, and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HEALS-EU.|url=http://www.heals-eu.eu/|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the US [[National Academy of Sciences]] hosted a meeting entitled "Emerging Technologies for Measuring Individual Exposomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Academy of Sciences meeting|url=http://nas-sites.org/emergingscience/meetings/exposome/|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] overview,  "Exposome and Exposomics", outlines the three priority areas for researching the occupational exposome as identified by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]].&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) has invested in technologies supporting exposome-related research including biosensors, and supports research on [[gene-environment interaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIEHS Gene-Environment studies|url=http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/science/gene-env/index.cfm|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genes and Environment Initiative|url=http://www.genome.gov/19518663|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed Human Exposome Project (HEP)==

The idea of a Human Exposome Project, analogous to the [[Human Genome Project]], has been proposed and discussed in numerous scientific meetings, but as of 2017, no such project exists. Given the lack of clarity on how science would go about pursuing such a project, support has been lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaud, Celia Henry (16 August 2010).

The concept of the exposome has contributed to the 2010 proposal of a new [[paradigm]] in disease [[phenotype]], "the unique disease principle": Every individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual, considering uniqueness of the exposome and its unique influence on molecular pathologic processes including alterations in the [[interactome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Lochhead P, Chan AT, et al | year = 2013 | title = Molecular pathological epidemiology of epigenetics: emerging integrative science to analyze environment, host, and disease | url = | journal = Mod Pathol | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 465–484 | doi=10.1038/modpathol.2012.214 | pmid=23307060 | pmc=3637979}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle was first described in neoplastic diseases as "the unique tumor principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E | year = 2012 | title = How many molecular subtypes?

'''Financescape''' is one the five aspects of global cultural flows that renowned [[globalization]] theorist [[Arjun Appadurai]] proposed in his article ''Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy'' that he claims can be used to distinguish the various [[wikt:disjuncture|disjunctures]] or disconnections between economy, culture and politics, within the overall [[World economy|global economy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Globalization Reader|last = Appadurai|first = Arjun|publisher = Blackwell Publishers|year = 1990|isbn = 978-1118733554|location = UK|pages = 94–103|editor-last = Lechner|editor-first = Frank|edition = 5|editor-last2 = Boli|editor-first2 = John|publication-date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appadurai poses that when considering the financescape framework, we must consider how global capital today moves in an increasingly fluid and non-[[wikt:isomorphic|isomorphic]] manner, thus contributing to an overall unpredictability of all the five aspects of global cultural flows as a whole.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The four other aspects Appadurai mentions in his article are [[ethnoscape]]s, [[technoscape]]s, [[mediascape]]s and [[ideoscape]]s. Appadurai further states that despite disjunctures having always existed between the flows of people, machinery, money, ideas and images, the world is at a crossroads where this is happening to a larger extent; pointing to the importance of studying the "-scapes".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These disjunctures also contribute to the central idea of [[deterritorialization]] which Appadurai describes as the main force affecting globalization in the sense that people from different countries and [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] backgrounds are mixing with one another; namely the lower class of some countries integrating in to wealthier societies via the work force.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Subsequently, these people reproduce their ethnic culture, but in a deterritorialized context.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fluidity of capital has been expounded on further by sociologists such as [[Anthony Giddens]] who in his 1999 [[Reith Lectures|BBC Reith lecture]] on "Globalization" claims that the advent of electronic money has rendered the transfer of capital and finance around the world subject to an increasingly easy process that posits a major paradigm shift. Giddens suggests that this ease has the potential to destabilize what would be considered prior as stable economies.

An '''[[immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] virtual musical instrument''', or immersive virtual environment for music and sound, represents sound processes and their parameters as 3D entities of a [[virtual reality]] so that they can be perceived not only through auditory feedback but also visually in 3D and possibly through tactile as well as haptic feedback, using 3D [[interface metaphor]]s consisting of [[interaction technique]]s such as navigation, selection and manipulation (NSM).&lt;ref&gt;[Doug Bowman, Ernst Kruijff, Joseph LaViola, Ivan Poupyrev, Wolfgang Stuerzlinger. 3D User Interfaces: Design, Implementation, Usability (2010). Course Notes of the 28th International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM, New York, NY, USA.]&lt;/ref&gt; It builds on the trend in [[electronic musical instruments]] to develop new ways to control sound and perform music such as explored in conferences like [[NIME]].

== State of the art ==

Florent Berthaut&lt;ref&gt;[F. Berthaut, M. Desainte-Catherine, and M. Hachet. DRILE: an immersive environment for hierarchical live-looping. In Proceedings of the 2010 International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME10), Sydney, NSW, Australia, pages 192–197, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; created a variety of 3D reactive widgets involving novel representations of musical events and sound, that required a special 3D input device to interact with them using adapted 3D interaction techniques. 

Jared Bott&lt;ref&gt;[Jared N. Bott, James G. Crowley, and Joseph J. LaViola. 2009. One Man Band: A 3D Gestural Interface for Collaborative Music Creation. In Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE Virtual Reality Conference (VR '09). IEEE Computer Society, Washington, DC, USA, 273-274.]&lt;/ref&gt; created an environment that used 3D spatial control techniques as used in known musical instruments, with symbolic 2D visual representation of musical events.

Richard Polfreman&lt;ref&gt;[R. Polfreman. Frameworks 3d: composition in the third dimension. pages 226–229, Pittsburgh, USA, Carnegie Mellon University, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; made a 3D virtual environment for musical composition with visual representations of musical and sound data similar to 2D composition environments but placed in a 3D space.

Leonel Valbom&lt;ref&gt;[L Valbom, A Marcos (2007)  An Immersive Musical Instrument Prototype   IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications 27: 4. 14-18]&lt;/ref&gt; created a 3D immersive virtual environment with visual 3D representations of musical events and [[audio spatialization]] with which could be interacted using NSM interaction techniques.

Teemu Mäki-Patola&lt;ref&gt;[T. Maaki-Patola, J. Laitinen, A. Kanerva, and T. Takala. Experiments with virtual reality instruments. In Proceedings of the 2005 International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME05), Vancouver, BC, Canada, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; explored interaction metaphors based on existing musical instruments as seen in his Virtual Xylophone, Virtual Membrane, and Virtual Air Guitar implementations. 

Sutoolz from su-Studio Barcelona&lt;ref&gt;[R. Porcher, J. Wynnychuk, L. Brajovic, M. Brajovic and N. Platas. sutoolz 1.0 alpha: 3D software music interface. In Proceedings of the 2002 International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME02), Dublin, Medialab Europe, Ireland, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt; used real time 3D video games technology to allow a live performer to construct and play a fully audio visual immersive environment.

Axel Mulder&lt;ref&gt;[A.G.E. Mulder. Design of virtual three-dimensional instruments for sound control. PhD thesis, Simon Fraser University, Canada, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt; explored the sculpting interaction metaphor by creating a 3D virtual environment that allowed interaction with abstract deformable shapes, such as a sheet and a sphere, which parameters were mapped to sound effects in innovative ways. The work focused on proving the technical feasibility of 3D virtual musical instruments. Gestural control was based on 3D object manipulation such as a subset of prehension.

Early work was done by [[Jaron Lanier]] with his Chromatophoria band and separately by [[Niko Bolas]] who developed the Soundsculpt Toolkit, a software interface that allows the world of music to communicate with the graphical elements of virtual reality.

The term "'''interspecies family'''" refers to a group consisting of at least two members of different species who deeply care for each other. Examples include a human and their dog, a couple and their cats, a dog and a cat, or even a mule and a sheep. The emphasis is on love and that the members of the group care for and treat each other like a family.  For instance, "interspecies family" may describe a group composed of a dog and a person who refers to their dog as their child, best friend, or other phrase that connotes a stronger bond than just a "pet", a term which implies a sense of property and ownership.

Most often this is used to discuss non-human interspecies families, typically where a mother of one species will foster a youngling from a different species. With the more recent growth of the fields of [[anthrozoology]] and [[animal studies]], this is being used more frequently to refer especially to bonds between human and non-human animals. 
 
== History and use ==

=== Anthropomorphism ===
Some of the earliest instances of the interspecies family involve the use of [[anthropomorphism]], such as in the children's book ''[[Stuart Little]]'' in which a mouse is a member of a human family. This is a fairly common idea which led to some of the first uses of "interspecies family" in media targeted towards children.

=== Non-human animal relationships ===
There is also a popular trend in books and internet sites that involves capturing photographs and stories of interspecies non-human animal families.  These heartwarming cases promote the idea that animals can look past such differences. However, in these cases they are more often referred to as "interspecies adoptions", "interspecies pairings", and "interspecies friendships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nobel|first=Oliver|title=Interspecies Animal Friendships Will Warm Your Heart (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/30/interspecies-animal-friendships_n_1556674.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human and non-human animal relationships ===
Just recently, the term has been used to describe non-fiction situations involving human and non-human animal relationships. In 2011 a dissertation was written by Avigdor Edminster entitled ''"'This Dog Means Life': Making Interspecies Relations at an Assistance Dog Agency"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edminster|first=Avigdor|title="This Dog Means Life": Making Interspecies Relations at an Assistance Dog Agency|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/107791/1/Edminster_umn_0130E_11975.pdf|publisher=University of Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt;   in which "Interspecies families" is used frequently.  There have been other instances since then, but they have been strictly within academic works.

In the fall of 2013, The National Museum of Animals &amp; Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museum of Animals and Society|url=http://www.museumofanimals.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  created the exhibit entitled {{'}}''My Dog Is My Home: The Experience of Human-Animal Homelessness''{{'}}. The exhibit explores the experience of being homeless with an animal, and specifically the needs that are unmet because of homeless services' failure to recognize the legitimacy of the human-animal bond and their status as an "interspecies family". The exhibit helped popularize the phrase "interspecies family" among its animal protection audience as well as among social service providers. Part of the museum's mission is to promote this idea of inter-species families and make the general public more aware of the strong bonds that can be shared between human and non-human animals.

The '''John Hope Franklin Center for Interdisciplinary and International Studies''' (JHFC) is located at [[Duke University]] in the United States. It is a consortium of programs dedicated to studying and revitalizing theories of how knowledge is gained and exchanged. The more than twenty participants come from a broad range of disciplines, converging to explore intellectual, social, and political issues, including race and race relations, the legacy of the African-American Experience, equality and opportunity amongst populations, and the implications of globalization. In essence, the Center's mission is to facilitate the interactions of humanists and others involved in the social sciences in an intellectual setting amenable to diverse partnerships.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.jhfc.duke.edu/about/jhf.php About the Center &gt;&gt; John Hope Franklin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814071316/http://www.jhfc.duke.edu/about/jhf.php |date=2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
The Franklin Center is named after Dr. [[John Hope Franklin]], the James B. Duke Professor Emeritus of History and former professor of Legal History at Duke. An intellectual leader and lifelong civil rights activist, his work has inspired the Center's dedication to creative sharing of ideas and methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/specialcollections/franklin/bio.html Biography of John Hope Franklin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

One essential aspect of the Franklin Center is its wholehearted embrace of new technologies and innovations to enhance intellectual exchange. Using resources such as multimedia and high-speed videoconferencing, the Center employs advanced technologies both as a means to share ideas and as an end, aware of the revolutionizing power of these innovations in education and society.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

On the bus line and within walking distance to other parts of Duke's campuses, the Center is easily accessible to residents from the Durham and Triangle area, who are invited to participate in and experience workshops, lectures, exhibits, and other public events. A brown-bag lunch series--"Wednesday Conversations"—invites local residents and community leaders to share insights and expertise on matters of local and universal consequence. Past speakers have included professors from universities around the country as well as people from high-ranking positions in various foundations and associations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duke.edu/web/institute/assets/pdfs/events/WedConversations.pdf Wednesday Conversations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914051118/http://www.duke.edu/web/institute/assets/pdfs/events/WedConversations.pdf |date=2006-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3282">The '''Konrad Lorenz Institute of Ethology''' (German: “Konrad-Lorenz-Institut für Vergleichende Verhaltensforschung“ or KLIVV) is a research institute in [[Vienna]], Austria, dedicated to studying behavioral biology and the links between animal behaviour and conservation. Founded by the animal photographer Otto Koenig and his wife, the illustrator Lilli Koenig as “Biologische Station Wilhelminenberg” (Biological Station Wilhelminenberg) in 1945, it was later named after the Nobel laureate [[Konrad Lorenz]] and incorporated into the [[University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna]] in 2011.

==History and organisation==
The “Biologische Station Wilheminenberg” was founded by the biologist couple Otto and Lilli Koenig in response to the ground-breaking research in the field of comparative ethology, including the work by Konrad Lorenz. The research institute was established in abandoned army barracks&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencev2.orf.at/stories/1671239/&lt;/ref&gt; in the outskirts of Vienna’s 16th district [[Ottakring]] at the onset of the [[Vienna Woods]], and endowed with substantial space and facilities supported by private means.

The facility developed and was re-structured into the Institute of Ethology of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in 1967. Otto Koenig, who became a public figure through his role as a presenter of nature documentaries,&lt;ref&gt;https://idw-online.de/de/news609724&lt;/ref&gt; remained director also after this re-structuring until his retirement in 1984. He was succeeded by the ornithologist Hans Winkler. When Konrad Lorenz died in 1989, the institute was renamed after him.

Under the leadership of Hans Winkler, the Konrad Lorenz Institute was gradually modernised and both laboratories and staff were extended. This resulted in substantial refurbishments between 1985 and 2002, when Dustin J. Penn succeeded Winkler as director.

In 2011, the Konrad Lorenz Institute was merged with the Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology and both facilities became part of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. Both research institutes combined now provide a facility for approximately 80 scientists. Director of the new institute is Walter Arnold. Since spring 2015, the Konrad Lorenz Institute is also the headquarter of the Austrian Ornithological Centre (AOC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/konrad-lorenz-institute-of-ethology/austrian-ornithological-centre-aoc/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The scientific work at the Konrad Lorenz Institute traditionally focusses on ethology and evolutionary aspects of animal behaviour, in particular related to sexual selection and sexual conflicts. The restructuring of 2011 broadened the research objectives to include physiological and ecological aspects of wild animals in interaction with their environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39496">In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''method of Lagrange multipliers''' (named after [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]&lt;ref&gt;Mécanique Analytique sect. IV, 2 vols. Paris, 1811 https://archive.org/details/mcaniqueanalyt01lagr&lt;/ref&gt;) is a strategy for finding the local [[maxima and minima]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] subject to [[constraint (mathematics)|equality constraints]] (i.e., subject to the condition that one or more [[equation]]s have to be satisfied exactly by the chosen values of the variables). The great advantage of this method is that it allows the optimization to be solved without explicit [[parameterization]] in terms of the constraints. As a result, the method of Lagrange multipliers is widely used to solve challenging constrained optimization problems.

The method can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bramanti|first1=Marco|title=Matematica: Calcolo Infinitesimale e Algebra Lineare|date=2004|publisher=Zanichelli|location=Bologna|isbn=978-88-08-07547-5|pages=462–468|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# isolate any possible [[Singular point of an algebraic variety|singular point]] of the solution set of the constraining equations,
# find all the [[stationary point]]s of the ''Lagrange function'',
# establish which of those stationary points and singular points are global maxima (or minima, in case of minimization problems) of the objective function.

== Single constraint ==
[[Image:LagrangeMultipliers2D.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1: The red curve shows the constraint &lt;span style="color: DarkRed"&gt;{{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} ''c''}}&lt;/span&gt;. The blue curves are contours of &lt;span style="color:DarkSlateBlue"&gt;{{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}}&lt;/span&gt;. The point where the red constraint tangentially touches a blue contour is the maximum of &lt;span style="color:DarkSlateBlue"&gt;{{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}}&lt;/span&gt; along the constraint, since {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.]]

For the case of only one constraint and only two choice variables (as exemplified in Figure 1), consider the [[optimization problem]]

:maximize  {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}}
:subject to {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 0}}.

(Sometimes an additive constant is shown separately rather than being included in ''g'', in which case the constraint is written {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} ''c''}}, as in Figure 1.) We assume that both {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} have continuous first [[partial derivative]]s.  We introduce a new variable ({{mvar|λ}}) called a '''Lagrange multiplier''' and study the '''Lagrange function''' (or '''Lagrangian''' or '''Lagrangian expression''') defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}(x,y,\lambda) = f(x,y) - \lambda \cdot g(x,y),&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{mvar|λ}} term may be either added or subtracted. If {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a maximum of {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} for the original constrained problem, then there exists {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a [[stationary point]] for the Lagrange function (stationary points are those points where the first partial derivatives of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; are zero). However, not all stationary points yield a solution of the original problem, as the method of Lagrange multipliers yields only a [[necessary condition]] for optimality in constrained problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bertsekas|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{springer | id=Lagrange_multipliers | title=Lagrange multipliers| first=I.B. | last=Vapnyarskii }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lasdon|1970|pages=xi+523}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiriart-Urruty|Lemaréchal|1993|pages=136–193 (and Bibliographical comments on pp.&amp;nbsp;334–335)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Computational combinatorial optimization: Papers from the Spring School held in Schloß Dagstuhl, May&amp;nbsp;15–19,&amp;nbsp;2000 |last=Lemaréchal |first=Claude |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2001 |isbn=3-540-42877-1 |editor-last=Jünger |editor-first=Michael |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=2241 |location=Berlin |pages=112–156 |chapter=Lagrangian relaxation |doi=10.1007/3-540-45586-8_4 |mr=1900016 |author-link=Claude Lemaréchal |editor-last2=Naddef |editor-first2=Denis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient conditions for a minimum or maximum [[Bordered Hessian|also exist]], but if a particular [[candidate solution]] satisfies the sufficient conditions, it is only guaranteed that that solution is the best one ''locally'' – that is, it is better than any permissible nearby points. The ''global'' optimum can be found by comparing the values of the original objective function at the points satisfying the necessary and locally sufficient conditions.

The method of Lagrange multipliers relies on the intuition that at a maximum, {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} cannot be increasing in the direction of any neighboring point where {{math|''g'' {{=}} 0}}. If it were, we could walk along {{math|''g'' {{=}} 0}} to get higher, meaning that the starting point wasn't actually the maximum.

We can visualize [[Contour line|contour]]s of {{mvar|f}} given by {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} ''d''}} for various values of {{mvar|d}}, and the contour of {{mvar|g}} given by {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 0}}.

Suppose we walk along the contour line with {{math|''g'' {{=}} 0}}. We are interested in finding points where {{mvar|f}} does not change as we walk, since these points might be maxima.

There are two ways this could happen: 

# We could be following a contour line of {{mvar|f}}, since by definition {{mvar|f}} does not change as we walk along its contour lines. This would mean that the contour lines of {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are parallel here.
# We have reached a "level" part of {{mvar|f}}, meaning that {{mvar|f}} does not change in any direction.

To check the first possibility (we are following a contour line of {{mvar|f}}), notice that since the [[gradient]] of a function is perpendicular to the contour lines, the contour lines of {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}}  are parallel if and only if the gradients of {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are parallel. Thus we want points {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} where {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 0}} and

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{x,y} f = \lambda \nabla_{x,y} g,&lt;/math&gt;

for some {{mvar|λ}}

where

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_{x,y} f= \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right), \qquad \nabla_{x,y} g= \left( \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

are the respective gradients. The constant {{mvar|λ}} is required because although the two gradient vectors are parallel, the magnitudes of the gradient vectors are generally not equal. This constant is called the Lagrange multiplier. (In some conventions {{mvar|λ}} is preceded by a minus sign).

Notice that this method also solves the second possibility, that {{mvar|f}} is level: if {{mvar|f}} is level, then its gradient is zero, and setting {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 0}} is a solution regardless of &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{x,y}g&lt;/math&gt;.

To incorporate these conditions into one equation, we introduce an auxiliary function

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}(x,y,\lambda) = f(x,y) - \lambda \cdot g(x,y), &lt;/math&gt;

and solve

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_{x,y,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda)=0. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that this amounts to solving three equations in three unknowns. This is the method of Lagrange multipliers. Note that &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda)=0&lt;/math&gt; implies {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 0}}. To summarize
:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla_{x,y,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda)=0 \iff 
\begin{cases}
\nabla_{x,y} f(x , y) = \lambda \nabla_{x,y} g(x , y)\\
 g(x,y) = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The method generalizes readily to functions on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_{x_1, \dots, x_n,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x_1, \dots, x_n, \lambda)=0&lt;/math&gt;

which amounts to solving &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; equations in &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; unknowns.

The constrained extrema of {{mvar|f}} are ''[[Critical point (mathematics)|critical points]]'' of the Lagrangian &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, but they are not necessarily ''local extrema'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[#Example 2|Example 2]] below).

One may [[Hamiltonian mechanics#As a reformulation of Lagrangian mechanics|reformulate the Lagrangian]] as a [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]], in which case the solutions are local minima for the Hamiltonian. This is done in [[optimal control]] theory, in the form of [[Pontryagin's minimum principle]].

The fact that solutions of the Lagrangian are not necessarily extrema also poses difficulties for numerical optimization. This can be addressed by computing the ''magnitude'' of the gradient, as the zeros of the magnitude are necessarily local minima, as illustrated in the [[#Example 4: Numerical optimization|numerical optimization example]].

== Multiple constraints ==
[[Image:As wiki lgm parab.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 2: A paraboloid constrained along two intersecting lines.]]
[[Image:As wiki lgm levelsets.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 3: Contour map of Figure 2.]]
The method of Lagrange multipliers can be extended to solve problems with multiple constraints using a similar argument. Consider a [[paraboloid]] subject to two line constraints that intersect at a single point. As the only feasible solution, this point is obviously a constrained extremum. However, the [[level set]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is clearly not parallel to either constraint at the intersection point (see Figure 3); instead, it is a linear combination of the two constraints' gradients. In the case of multiple constraints, that will be what we seek in general: the method of Lagrange seeks points not at which the gradient of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is multiple of any single constraint's gradient necessarily, but in which it is a linear combination of all the constraints' gradients.

Concretely, suppose we have &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; constraints and are walking along the set of points satisfying &lt;math&gt;g_i(\mathbf{x})=0, i=1, \dots, M&lt;/math&gt;. Every point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; on the contour of a given constraint function &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; has a space of allowable directions: the space of vectors perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\nabla g_i(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of directions that are allowed by all constraints is thus the space of directions perpendicular to all of the constraints' gradients.  Denote this space of allowable moves by &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and denote the span of the constraints' gradients by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;A = S^{\perp}&lt;/math&gt;, the space of vectors perpendicular to every element of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

We are still interested in finding points where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; does not change as we walk, since these points might be (constrained) extrema. We therefore seek &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; such that any allowable direction of movement away from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; (otherwise we could increase &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by moving along that allowable direction).  In other words, &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(\mathbf{x}) \in A^{\perp} = S&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus there are scalars {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''λ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such that

: &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{k=1}^M  \lambda_k \nabla g_k (\mathbf{x})  \quad \iff \quad \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) -  \sum_{k=1}^M {\lambda_k \nabla g_k (\mathbf{x})} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

These scalars are the Lagrange multipliers. We now have &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of them, one for every constraint.

As before, we introduce an auxiliary function

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left( x_1,\ldots , x_n, \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda _M \right) = f\left( x_1, \ldots, x_n \right) - \sum\limits_{k=1}^M {\lambda_k g_k\left( x_1, \ldots , x_n \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

and solve

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_{x_1, \ldots , x_n, \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda _M} \mathcal{L}(x_1, \ldots , x_n, \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda _M)=0 \iff 
\begin{cases}
\nabla f(\mathbf{x}) - \sum_{k=1}^M {\lambda_k \, \nabla g_k (\mathbf{x})} = 0\\
 g_1(\mathbf{x}) = \cdots = g_M(\mathbf{x}) = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

which amounts to solving &lt;math&gt;n+M&lt;/math&gt; equations in &lt;math&gt;n+M&lt;/math&gt; unknowns.

The method of Lagrange multipliers is generalized by the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]], which can also take into account inequality constraints of the form {{math|''h''('''x''')&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c''}}.


==Modern formulation via differentiable manifolds==

The problem of finding the local maxima and minima subject to constraints can be generalized to finding local maxima and minima on a [[differentiable manifold]].

===Single constraint===
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a [[smooth manifold]] of dimension &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that we wish to find the stationary points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of a smooth function &lt;math&gt;f:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; when restricted to the submanifold &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth function for which 0 is a [[regular value]] of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dg&lt;/math&gt; be the [[exterior derivative]]s. Stationarity for the restriction &lt;math&gt;f|_{N}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x\in N&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;d(f|_{N})_x=0&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, the kernel &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}(df_x)&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;T_x N=\operatorname{ker}(dg_x)&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;df_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dg_x&lt;/math&gt; are proportional vectors. For this it is necessary and sufficient that the following system of &lt;math&gt;m(m-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; equations holds:

:&lt;math&gt;df_x \wedge dg_x = 0 \in \Lambda^{2}(T^{*}_{x}M)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[exterior algebra|exterior product]]. The stationary points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are the solutions of the above system of equations plus the constraint &lt;math&gt;g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the &lt;math&gt;m(m-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; equations are not independent, since the left-hand side of the equation belongs to the subvariety of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{2}(T^{*}_{x}M)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of [[exterior algebra|decomposable elements]].

In this formulation, it is not necessary to explicitly find the Lagrange multiplier, a number &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;df_x = \lambda dg_x&lt;/math&gt;.

===Multiple constraints===
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a [[smooth manifold]] embedded in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; with codimension &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a differentiable function that we wish to maximize on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. By an extension of [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem]] the local maxima occur at points where the [[exterior derivative]] &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lafontaine|p=[{{google books|id=KNhJCgAAQBAJ|pg=PA70|plainurl=yes}} 70]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, supposing we have a local [[coordinate chart]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi\colon U \to \mathbb{R}^{n-p}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;U \subseteq M&lt;/math&gt;, the extrema of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are a subset of the critical points of the function &lt;math&gt;f_\varphi = f \circ \varphi^{-1}\colon V \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the image of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.
However, it is often difficult to compute &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; explicitly. ''The entire method of Lagrange multipliers reduces to the idea of skipping that step and finding the zeros of &lt;math&gt;df_\varphi&lt;/math&gt; directly.''

It remains to show that this notion of critical point is well defined. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; are charts on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; whose domains both contain some point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. The chain rule implies that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(y)&lt;/math&gt; is a critical point of &lt;math&gt;f_\varphi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\psi(y)&lt;/math&gt; is a critical point of &lt;math&gt;f_\psi&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed,

:&lt;math&gt;f_\varphi=f\circ\varphi^{-1}=f\circ(\psi^{-1}\circ\psi)\circ\varphi^{-1}=f_\psi\circ(\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

The composition &lt;math&gt;\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Atlas (topology)|transition map]] for &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and therefore is a diffeomorphism. It follows that

:&lt;math&gt;D_{\varphi(y)}f_\varphi=D_{\psi(y)}f_\psi\circ D_{\varphi(y)}(\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}),&lt;/math&gt;

so &lt;math&gt;D_{\varphi(y)}f_\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; map if and only if the same is true of &lt;math&gt;D_{\psi(y)}f_\psi&lt;/math&gt;. Formally, we're looking for points &lt;math&gt;y\in M&lt;/math&gt; such that for some (and hence any) chart &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(y)&lt;/math&gt; is a critical point of &lt;math&gt;f_\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jeffrey M. (2009). ''Manifolds and Differential Geometry.'' Providence: American Mathematical Society. p. 23. {{ISBN|978-0-8218-4815-9}}. Lee discusses a property being true specifically for some "and hence any" chart on a manifold.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose the manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is defined by a smooth [[level set]] function &lt;math&gt;g\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;M = \{ x \in\mathbb R^n : g(x) = c \}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;c \in \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g&lt;/math&gt; a [[Submersion (mathematics)|submersion]]. It follows from the construction in the level set theorem that the image of &lt;math&gt;D_x \varphi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\ker D_{\varphi^{-1}(x)} g \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, where we tacitly identify &lt;math&gt;T_{\varphi^{-1}(x)}M&lt;/math&gt; with a subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; via the inclusion map on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore,

: &lt;math&gt;0 = D_x f_\varphi = D_x (f \circ \varphi^{-1}) = D_{\varphi^{-1}(x)} f \circ D_x \varphi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\ker D_y g \subseteq \ker D_y f&lt;/math&gt;
writing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Again we can naturally interpret elements of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, particularly &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; itself, as points in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; via the inclusion map on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

By a combination of the first and third [[isomorphism theorems]], the image of &lt;math&gt;D_yf&lt;/math&gt; must be isomorphic to a subspace of the image of &lt;math&gt;D_yg&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that there exists a linear map &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\colon\mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \circ D_y g = D_y f&lt;/math&gt;. As a linear map, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} (x) = \lambda x&lt;/math&gt; for a fixed &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt;, so finding a critical point of &lt;math&gt;f_\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to solving the system of equations

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda D_y g =  D_y f&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;g(y) = c&lt;/math&gt;

in the variables &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt;. This is in general a non-linear system of &lt;math&gt;n+p&lt;/math&gt; equations and &lt;math&gt;n+p&lt;/math&gt; unknowns.

Finding local maxima of a function &lt;math&gt;f: U \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is done by finding all points &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;D_x f = 0&lt;/math&gt; then checking whether all the eigenvalues of the Hessian &lt;math&gt;H_x f&lt;/math&gt; are negative. (Note that the maxima may not exist even if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous because &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is open, and also note that the conditions checked here are sufficient but not necessary for optimality.) Setting &lt;math&gt;D_x f = 0&lt;/math&gt; is a non-linear problem and in general, arbitrarily difficult. After finding the critical points, checking the eigenvalues is a linear problem and thus easy.

==Interpretation of the Lagrange multipliers==
Often the Lagrange multipliers have an interpretation as some quantity of interest.  For example, if the Lagrangian expression is

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \ldots;\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots) \\[4pt]
= {} &amp; f(x_1, x_2, \ldots) + \lambda_1(c_1-g_1(x_1, x_2, \ldots))+\lambda_2(c_2-g_2(x_1, x_2, \dots))+\cdots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c_k} = \lambda_k.&lt;/math&gt;

So, {{math|''λ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the rate of change of the quantity being optimized as a function of the constraint parameter.
As examples, in [[Lagrangian mechanics]] the equations of motion are derived by finding stationary points of the [[Action (physics)|action]], the time integral of the difference between kinetic and potential energy.  Thus, the force on a particle due to a scalar potential, {{math|''F'' {{=}} −∇''V''}}, can be interpreted as a Lagrange multiplier determining the change in action (transfer of potential to kinetic energy) following a variation in the particle's constrained trajectory.  
In control theory this is formulated instead as [[costate equations]].

Moreover, by the [[envelope theorem]] the optimal value of a Lagrange multiplier has an interpretation as the marginal effect of the corresponding constraint constant upon the optimal attainable value of the original objective function: if we denote values at the optimum with an asterisk, then it can be shown that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{d} f(x_1^*(c_1, c_2, \dots), x_2^*(c_1, c_2, \dots), \dots)}{\text{d} c_k} = \lambda_k^*.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, in economics the optimal profit to a player is calculated subject to a constrained space of actions, where a Lagrange multiplier is the change in the optimal value of the objective function (profit) due to the relaxation of a given constraint (e.g. through a change in income); in such a context {{math|''λ''*}} is the [[marginal cost]] of the constraint, and is referred to as the [[shadow price]].

==Sufficient conditions==
{{Main|Hessian matrix#Bordered Hessian}}

Sufficient conditions for a constrained local maximum or minimum can be stated in terms of a sequence of principal minors (determinants of upper-left-justified sub-matrices) of the bordered [[Hessian matrix]] of second derivatives of the Lagrangian expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chiang|1984|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Example 1===
[[Image:Lagrange very simple.svg|thumb|right|300px|Illustration of the constrained optimization problem]]

====Example 1a====

Suppose we wish to maximize &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=x+y&lt;/math&gt; subject to the constraint &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=1&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Candidate solution|feasible set]] is the unit circle, and the [[level set]]s of {{mvar|f}} are diagonal lines (with slope −1), so we can see graphically that the maximum occurs at &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and that the minimum occurs at &lt;math&gt;\left(-\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2},-\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

For the method of Lagrange multipliers, the constraint is

:&lt;math&gt;g(x,y)=x^2+y^2-1,&lt;/math&gt;

hence

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) &amp;= f(x,y) + \lambda \cdot g(x,y) \\[4pt]
&amp;= x+y +  \lambda (x^2 + y^2 - 1).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can calculate the gradient:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\nabla_{x,y,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda) &amp;= \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} \right ) \\[4pt]
&amp;= \left ( 1  + 2 \lambda x, 1 + 2 \lambda y, x^2 + y^2 -1 \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{x,y,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda)=0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \begin{cases} 1 + 2 \lambda x = 0 \\ 1 + 2 \lambda y = 0 \\ x^2 + y^2 -1  = 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the last equation is the original constraint.

The first two equations yield

:&lt;math&gt;x= y = - \frac{1}{2\lambda}, \qquad \lambda \neq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

By substituting into the last equation we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4\lambda^2}+\frac{1}{4\lambda^2} - 1=0, &lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},&lt;/math&gt;

which implies that the stationary points of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right), \qquad \left(-\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the objective function {{mvar|f}} at these points yields

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)=\sqrt{2}, \qquad  f\left(-\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)=-\sqrt{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the constrained maximum is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the constrained minimum is &lt;math&gt;-\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

====Example 1b====

Now we modify the objective function of Example 1a so that we minimize &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=(x+y)^2&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=x+y,&lt;/math&gt; again along the circle &lt;math&gt;g(x,y)=x^2+y^2-1=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Now the level sets of ''f'' are still lines of slope −1, and the points on the circle tangent to these level sets are again &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{2}/2,\sqrt{2}/2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(-\sqrt{2}/2,-\sqrt{2}/2)&lt;/math&gt;. These tangency points are maxima of&amp;nbsp;''f''.

On the other hand, the minima occur on the level set for ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (since by its construction ''f'' cannot take negative values), at &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{2}/2,-\sqrt{2}/2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (-\sqrt{2}/2, \sqrt{2}/2)&lt;/math&gt;, where the level curves of ''f'' are not tangent to the constraint. The condition that &lt;math&gt;\nabla f=\lambda\nabla g&lt;/math&gt; correctly identifies all four points as extrema; the minima are characterized in particular by &lt;math&gt;\lambda =0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example 2 ===
[[Image:Lagrange simple.svg|thumb|right|300px| Illustration of the constrained optimization problem]]

In this example we will deal with some more strenuous calculations, but it is still a single constraint problem.

Suppose we want to find the maximum values of

:&lt;math&gt; f(x, y) = x^2 y&lt;/math&gt;

with the condition that the {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} coordinates lie on the circle around the origin with radius {{radic|3}}, that is, subject to the constraint

:&lt;math&gt; g(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 3 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

As there is just a single constraint, we will use only one multiplier, say {{mvar|λ}}.

The constraint {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'')}} is identically zero on the circle of radius {{radic|3}}. See that any multiple of {{math|''g''(''x'', ''y'')}} may be added to {{math|''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')}} leaving {{math|''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')}} unchanged in the region of interest (on the circle where our original constraint is satisfied).

Apply the ordinary Langrange multiplier method. Let:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) &amp;= f(x,y) + \lambda \cdot g(x, y) \\
&amp;= x^2y +  \lambda (x^2 + y^2 - 3)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can calculate the gradient:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\nabla_{x,y,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda) &amp;= \left ( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} \right ) \\
&amp;= \left ( 2 x y + 2 \lambda x, x^2 + 2 \lambda y, x^2 + y^2 -3 \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

And therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{x,y,\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x , y, \lambda)=0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \begin{cases} 2 x y + 2 \lambda x = 0 \\ x^2 + 2 \lambda y = 0 \\ x^2 + y^2 - 3 = 0 \end{cases} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \begin{cases} x (y + \lambda) = 0 &amp; (i) \\ x^2 = -2 \lambda y &amp; (ii) \\ x^2 + y^2 = 3 &amp; (iii) \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that (iii) is just the original constraint. (i) implies {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} ''or'' {{math|''λ'' {{=}} −''y''}}. If {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} then &lt;math&gt;y = \pm \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; by (iii) and consequently  {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 0}} from (ii). If {{math|''λ'' {{=}} −''y''}}, substituting in (ii) we get {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 2''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Substituting this in (iii) and solving for {{mvar|y}} gives {{math|''y'' {{=}} ±1}}. Thus there are six critical points of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; (\sqrt{2},1,-1); \quad (-\sqrt{2},1,-1); \quad (\sqrt{2},-1,1); \quad (-\sqrt{2},-1,1); \quad (0,\sqrt{3}, 0); \quad (0,-\sqrt{3}, 0). &lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the objective at these points, we find that

:&lt;math&gt; f(\pm\sqrt{2},1) = 2; \quad f(\pm\sqrt{2},-1) = -2; \quad f(0,\pm \sqrt{3})=0. &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the  objective function attains the [[global maximum]] (subject to the constraints) at &lt;math&gt;(\pm\sqrt{2},1)&lt;/math&gt; and the [[global minimum]] at &lt;math&gt;(\pm\sqrt{2},-1).&lt;/math&gt; The point &lt;math&gt;(0,\sqrt{3})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[local minimum]] of ''f'' and &lt;math&gt;(0,-\sqrt{3})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[local maximum]] of ''f'', as may be determined by consideration of the [[Hessian (mathematics)#Bordered Hessian|Hessian matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(x,y,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that while &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{2}, 1, -1)&lt;/math&gt; is a critical point of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, it is not a local extremum of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}.&lt;/math&gt; We have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \left (\sqrt{2} + \varepsilon, 1, -1 + \delta \right ) = 2 + \delta \left( \varepsilon^2 + \left (2\sqrt{2} \right)\varepsilon \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

Given any neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{2}, 1, -1)&lt;/math&gt;, we can choose a small positive &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and a small &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; of either sign to get &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; values both greater and less than &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;. This can also be seen from the fact that the Hessian matrix of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; evaluated at this point (or indeed at any of the critical points) is an [[indefinite matrix]]. Each of the critical points of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[saddle point]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example 3: [[Entropy]] ===
Suppose we wish to find the [[Probability distribution#Discrete probability distribution|discrete probability distribution]] on the points &lt;math&gt;\{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\}&lt;/math&gt; with maximal [[information entropy]]. This is the same as saying that we wish to find the [[Principle of maximum entropy|least structured]] probability distribution on the points &lt;math&gt;\{p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, we wish to maximize the [[Shannon entropy]] equation:

:&lt;math&gt;f(p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n) = -\sum_{j=1}^n p_j\log_2 p_j.&lt;/math&gt;

For this to be a probability distribution the sum of the probabilities &lt;math&gt; p_i &lt;/math&gt; at each point &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; must equal 1, so our constraint is:

:&lt;math&gt;g(p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n)=\sum_{j=1}^n p_j = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

We use Lagrange multipliers to find the point of maximum entropy, &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}^{\,*}&lt;/math&gt;, across all discrete probability distributions &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\{x_1,x_2, \ldots, x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. We require that:

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial \vec{p}}(f+\lambda (g-1))\right|_{\vec{p}=\vec{p}^{\,*}}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

which gives a system of {{mvar|n}} equations, &lt;math&gt; k = 1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;, such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial p_k}\left\{-\left (\sum_{j=1}^n p_j \log_2 p_j \right ) + \lambda \left(\sum_{j=1}^n p_j - 1\right) \right\}\right|_{p_k=p^*_k} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Carrying out the differentiation of these {{mvar|n}} equations, we get

:&lt;math&gt;-\left(\frac{1}{\ln 2}+\log_2 p^*_k \right)  + \lambda = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that all &lt;math&gt;p^*_k&lt;/math&gt; are equal (because they depend on {{mvar|λ}} only). By using the constraint

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_j p_j =1,&lt;/math&gt;

we find

:&lt;math&gt;p^*_k = \frac{1}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the uniform distribution is the distribution with the greatest entropy, among distributions on {{mvar|n}} points.

=== Example 4: Numerical optimization ===
[[Image:lagnum1.png|thumb|right|300px|Lagrange multipliers cause the critical points to occur at saddle points.]]

[[Image:lagnum2.png|thumb|right|300px|The magnitude of the gradient can be used to force the critical points to occur at local minima.]]

The critical points of Lagrangians occur at [[saddle point]]s, rather than at local maxima (or minima).&lt;ref name="Heath2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Heath|2005|p=[{{google books |id=gwBrMAEACAAJ |page=203 |plainurl=yes}} 203]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, many numerical optimization techniques, such as [[hill climbing]], [[gradient descent]], some of the [[quasi-Newton method]]s, among others, are designed to find local maxima (or minima) and not saddle points. For this reason, one must either modify the formulation to ensure that it's a minimization problem (for example, by extremizing the square of the [[gradient]] of the Lagrangian as below), or else use an optimization technique that finds [[stationary points]] (such as [[Newton's method in optimization|Newton's method]] without an extremum seeking [[line search]]) and not necessarily extrema.

As a simple example, consider the problem of finding the value of {{mvar|x}} that minimizes &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;, constrained such that &lt;math&gt;x^2=1&lt;/math&gt;. (This problem is somewhat pathological because there are only two values that satisfy this constraint, but it is useful for illustration purposes because the corresponding unconstrained function can be visualized in three dimensions.)

Using Lagrange multipliers, this problem can be converted into an unconstrained optimization problem:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda)=x^2+\lambda(x^2-1).&lt;/math&gt;

The two critical points occur at saddle points where {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} −1}}.

In order to solve this problem with a numerical optimization technique, we must first transform this problem such that the critical points occur at local minima. This is done by computing the magnitude of the gradient of the unconstrained optimization problem.

First, we compute the partial derivative of the unconstrained problem with respect to each variable:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x}=2x+2x\lambda \\[5pt]
&amp; \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda}=x^2-1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If the target function is not easily differentiable, the differential with respect to each variable can be approximated as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x}\approx\frac{\mathcal{L}(x+\varepsilon,\lambda)-\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda)}{\varepsilon}, \\[5pt]
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda}\approx\frac{\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda+\varepsilon)-\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda)}{\varepsilon},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a small value.

Next, we compute the magnitude of the gradient, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the partial derivatives:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
h(x,\lambda) &amp; = \sqrt{(2x+2x\lambda)^2+(x^2-1)^2} \\[4pt]
&amp; \approx\sqrt{\left(\frac{\mathcal{L}(x+\varepsilon,\lambda)-\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda)}{\varepsilon}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda+\varepsilon)-\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda)}{\varepsilon}\right)^2}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

(Since magnitude is always non-negative, optimizing over the squared-magnitude is equivalent to optimizing over the magnitude. Thus, the &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;square root" may be omitted from these equations with no expected difference in the results of optimization.)

The critical points of {{mvar|h}} occur at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} −1}}, just as in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;. Unlike the critical points in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, however, the critical points in {{mvar|h}} occur at local minima, so numerical optimization techniques can be used to find them.

==Applications==

===Control theory===
In [[optimal control]] theory, the Lagrange multipliers are interpreted as [[costate]] variables, and Lagrange multipliers are reformulated as the minimization of the [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]], in [[Pontryagin's minimum principle]].

===Nonlinear programming===
The Lagrange multiplier method has several generalizations. In [[nonlinear programming]] there are several multiplier rules, ''e.g.'', the Carathéodory–John Multiplier Rule and the Convex Multiplier Rule, for inequality constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pourciau |first=Bruce H. |date=1980 |title=Modern Multiplier Rules |url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/modern-multiplier-rules |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=433–452 |doi=10.2307/2320250 |jstor=2320250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15494">'''Life chances''' (''Lebenschancen'' in [[German language|German]]) is a social science theory of the [[wikt:opportunity|opportunities]] each individual has to improve their quality of life. The concept was introduced by German sociologist [[Max Weber]]. It is a [[probabilistic]] concept, describing how likely it is, given certain factors, that an individual's life will turn out a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;(Hughes 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, life chances are positively [[correlation|correlated]] with one's [[socioeconomic status]].&lt;ref name=black&gt;Blackwell, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Opportunities in this sense refer to the extent to which one has access to resources, both tangible ones such as food, clothing and shelter, and intangible ones such as education and health care.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Life chances comprise the individual's ability to procure [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]], have a [[career]] and obtain inner satisfaction; in other words, the ability to satisfy one's [[needs]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Cuneo, [http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/soc/courses/soc2r3/weber/weberidx.htm Max Weber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909161957/http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/soc/courses/soc2r3/weber/weberidx.htm |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Weberian life chances can be seen as an expansion on some of functionalist [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Both Weber and Marx agreed that economic factors were important in determining one's future, but Weber's concepts of life chances are more complex; inspired by, but different from Marx's views on [[social stratification]] and [[social class]]. Where for Marx the [[class status]] was the most important factor, and he correlated life chances with material wealth, Weber introduced such additional factors as [[social mobility]] and [[social equality]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowenna Harrison, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080607140427/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/CURRIC/soc/lowerSixthA.htm Is an unstratified society possible?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/life_chances/index.asp Life Chances and Social Mobility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916023204/http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/life_chances/index.asp |date=2006-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors include those related to one's socioeconomic status, such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], and [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref name=ffg&gt;Kevin Fitzpatrick, Mark La Gory, ''Unhealthy places: the ecology of risk in the urban landscape'', Psychology Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-92372-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415923727&amp;id=Mh0ZV5fl2cAC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=%22Life+chances%22+Weber&amp;sig=-NoWukzqbmGuxhbpmxpbb402R-4 Google Print, p.90-91]&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of those factors, like age, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[gender]], are random,&lt;ref name=ffg/&gt; Weber stressed the link between life chances and the non-random elements of the three-component theory of stratification&amp;nbsp;– how [[social class]], [[social status]] and [[political affiliation]] affect each individual's life. In other words, individuals in certain [[group (sociology)|groups]] have in common a specific [[causal]] component of their life chances: they are in similar situation, which tends to imply a similar outcome to their actions. Weber notes the importance of [[economic]] factors:&lt;ref&gt;William C. Cockerham ''Health and social change in [[Russia]] and Eastern Europe
'', Routledge, 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-92081-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415920809&amp;id=GOZFhIBmN1gC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Life+chances%22+Weber&amp;sig=oWGnkOVVG5Ih1IjPG0__6J4t5R8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msop&gt;[http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/o2302.htm Multiple Sources of Power&amp;nbsp;– Class, Status, and Party]&lt;/ref&gt; how the [[power (sociology)|power]] of those with [[property]], compared to those without property, gives the former great advantages over the latter.&lt;ref name=msop/&gt;

Weber also noted that life chances are to certain extent [[Subjectivity|subjective]]: one's assessment of one's life chances will affect one's actions; therefore, if one believes that one is or can become a respected and valued member of [[society]], that outcome and associated positive results are more likely to become a reality for such a person than they are for one without this conviction.&lt;ref name=hewett&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080607123432/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/CURRIC/soc/weber/wclass.htm Weber and Class].&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons without such a belief, especially those who consciously espouse or have unconsciously internalized a belief to the contrary, are vulnerable to [[learned helplessness]] and its long-term effects.

In terms of [[agency and structure]], life chances represent the structure, the factors that one has no control over; whereas one's [[life conduct]] - values and beliefs, attitude to risk taking, social skills, or more generally, [[free will]]ed choices about one's [[behavior]] - represent the factors one has control over.&lt;ref name=ffg/&gt; According to Weber theories, together with life conduct, life chances are responsible for one's [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name=black/&gt;

In [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]], life chances may have to be balanced against other goals, such as eliminating [[poverty]], ensuring [[Freedom (political)|personal freedom]] or ensuring equality at birth.

==Ascriptive qualities==
The life chances approach suggests that status is not entirely [[Achieved status|achieved]], but is, to some extent, [[Ascribed status|ascribed]]. Overall, in societies emphasizing [[ascription]], opportunity is relatively low and status (in the sense of prestige in the community) is often inherited.
This means that people are, effectively, given their status as a result of the group into which they are born, rather than earning it entirely on merit.&lt;ref name="curriculum-press.co.uk"&gt;Yeates, Nicola. "Sociology Factsheet&amp;nbsp;– Life Chances."www.curriculum-press.co.uk. Bank House, n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ascriptive qualities such as [[Race (human classification)|race]]/[[ethnicity]], [[gender]], and [[Social class|class]] of origin can all affect one's life chances. In all societies parents pass on whatever advantages and disadvantages they have to their children.&lt;ref name="Beeghley, Leonard 2008"&gt;Beeghley, Leonard. "Sociology and Stratification." The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States. 5th ed. N.p.: Pearson Education, 2008. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A persons’ class of origin determines one's neighborhood they live in, which in turn will affect [[educational attainment]], the people they socialize with, and ultimately their [[class identification]]. A very important factor affecting life chances is housing. Poorer housing will affect health, available facilities, the likelihood of being a victim of crime, and many other aspects of life. Leisure facilities are often located in middle class areas or near non manual work places. Gym membership is expensive and subsidies are rarely available for lower grade staff. Therefore, in general, the middle and upper classes have far greater life chances available than the less advantaged groups.&lt;ref name="curriculum-press.co.uk"/&gt;

If born into a [[wealthy]] family a person will have access to far more desirable resources that can assist them in further enhancing their life chances to a far greater extent than someone who is born into a [[working class]] poor family. One of these resources includes a family's [[social ties]] and the ability for a person with well connected parents to benefit greatly in the status attainment process. [[Status attainment]] refers to how each individual enters an occupation. This encompasses how both ascribed and achieved factors combine, because each individual enters an occupation based on the way their parents’ status produces advantages and disadvantages, their own efforts and abilities, and a degree of luck.&lt;ref name="Beeghley, Leonard 2008"/&gt;

An additional dimension is the effect of family dynamics on life chances, such as the presence of biological parents, the quality of family relationships, and sibling configuration. For example, it has been demonstrated that children of divorced parents exhibit lower levels of psychological well-being, more problems in their own relationship, a greater risk of experiencing divorce, and also tend to be less educated.&lt;ref&gt;Gugushvili, Alexi. Ascriptive Inequality and Life Chances in Georgia. www.css.ge. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013. [http://www.eui.eu/Personal/Researchers/AlexiGugushvili/sept._2012_ENG.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overcoming bad life chances==
[[Max Weber]] discussed the effects of [[social stratification]] on life chances. He argued that life chances are opportunities and possibilities that make up one's [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Life chances are affected by a number of factors. Some of which include: [[income]], [[social class]], and [[occupational prestige]]. These factors all affect the availability of resources to an individual. For example, when one has low income, they have low life chances. Their education may not be as great and they may not have a high enough income to attain an advanced level of education.&lt;ref&gt;White, Kevin. "life chances." The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology. Ed. Bryan S. Turner. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 2006. 338. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 14 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Wout Ultee, education is a major aspect of overcoming life chances.&lt;ref name="blackwellreference.com"&gt;Ultee, Wout. "Life Chances and Resources." Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online. 15 November 2013 [http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode.html?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433118_ss1-43]&lt;/ref&gt;  Without an education, it is harder to obtain a job that provides a substantial income to provide for a family of four. “Higher education is the way to stay ahead."&lt;ref name="blackwellreference.com"/&gt; The higher the education, the higher income and [[occupational prestige]] one will have, which results in more resources for an individual and his family.

Early [[Health intervention|intervention]] is also necessary in improving life chances. Save the Children is a non-governmental group that works in the best interest of children. They promote children's rights and the aid children in [[underdeveloped]] countries that need relief. The UK has started an early intervention program that aids in improving life chances early on a child's life. They believe that "No child should endure poverty and no child's life chances should be shaped by the accident of birth."&lt;ref&gt;"Early Intervention Review." Save the Children. Save the Children, Nov. 2010. Web. 17 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This program was made to ensure that [[Educational inequality|inequalities]] in children's learning are tackled before problems can occur and separate them from peers. In order to do so, this program gives parents in lower classes the expertise they need to effectively help their children's learning in a home environment so that they are well prepared when they enter school. An example would be improving the parents' reading level so that they are able to teach their children how to read and write before kindergarten. This allows children in lower classes to be near the same level as children who are in higher classes with higher educated parents. Early intervention will allow for children to start out their education on the right foot, with skills they will need to succeed and achieve a high level of education, thus improving life chances.

==Class identification and lifestyle effects==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}
Weber noted that life chances are partially determined by [[Subjectivity|subjective]] factors, such as by how one perceives their life chances. How one [[perceives]] their life chances is in large part determined by what one perceives their [[social class]] to be since life chances and social class go hand in hand and both [[reinforce]] each other. According to Weber this is because life chances are largely determined by economic factors such as social class. The phenomenon of how you perceive things actually affecting the [[tangible]] outcomes of life chances is explained by [[Robert K. Merton]]'s theory of "self fulfilling prophecy" which he discusses in his book Social Theory and Social Structure. Essentially what it means is that individuals can tell themselves something like, "I'm lower class, my family has always been lower class, there's no chance I'm ever going to be well off" and although this statement had the potential to not end up being true, it became true simply because the individual believed it would be so and through his attitude and lack of self-esteem, made it his reality.

If you identify as low social class and believe you are most likely never going to be anything else, this will affect your life conduct in a myriad of ways. which in turn will affect your life chances. For one, the company you keep can lead to you networking with people that will not help you get out of a low socioeconomic environment. It can also affect your life conduct by making you think you are not qualified enough for anything but [[working class]] jobs. It can also affect your life conduct by making you think that pursuing higher education is not for someone of your social standing, further ensuring that you never get above working class work. The relationship between social class, life conduct, and life chances is a strong one that often decides what a person's fate in life will be like.

'''Arnott Maxwell Fernie''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|OBE|size=85%}} (25 April 1910{{spaced ndash}}22 May 1999) was a New Zealand [[organist]], teacher and conductor. He was an authority on [[Gregorian chant]], sixteenth century [[polyphony]], organ construction and tonal design.

==Life==
Fernie was born in [[Wellington]] on 25 April 1910 and received his first schooling from the [[Marist Brothers]] in [[Newtown, New Zealand|Newtown]] and later at [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]]. He became a leader in church music while still a young man, taking up the position of choir master and organist at St Joseph's Catholic Church, Wellington.

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], Fernie served with the second [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] in [[Egypt]] and Europe. At the end of the war he stayed on in England to study at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in [[London]], gaining several prizes.

Fernie returned to Wellington in the early 1950s as the director of music for Catholic Schools in the Archdiocese, a position he held until 1953 when he was called back to London as organist and choir instructor at [[Westminster Cathedral]].

After five acclaimed years of intensive organ playing, music making and teaching, he returned to New Zealand to become the Director of Music at [[St Mary of the Angels, Wellington|St. Mary of the Angels]] where he supervised the building of the new organ constructed to his design. Fernie's development of sixteenth century polyphony at St. Mary of the Angels became a model for [[Roman Catholic Church]] choirs.&lt;ref&gt;John Mansfield Thomson, ''The Oxford history of New Zealand music'', Oxford University Press, USA (16 May 1991), p=104&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, Fernie schooled choirs, taught piano, organ and singing, and trained celebrated musicians. His notable students included Nicolas Kynaston, [[Ivan Bootham]], Patricia Lawrey, Anthony Jennings, Peter Walls, [[Denis Smalley]], Geoffrey Coker, Roy Tankersley, Christopher Hainsworth and [[Barry Mora]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smoa.org.nz/music/fernie.php St Mary of the Angels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114033709/http://www.smoa.org.nz/music/fernie.php |date=14 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being a well-known broadcaster and lecturer, he founded and conducted the Schola Polyphonica Choir (specialising in 16th Century polyphony) in 1967. He was Wellington city organist for 27 years and played the [[Wellington Town Hall|Town Hall's]] massive Norman &amp; Beard pipe organ on numerous occasions for civic receptions and supervised its restoration in the 1980s. From 1963 till 1988 he taught a new generation of young organists at [[Victoria University of Wellington]], helping to bring about an organ renaissance in New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In 1978, Fernie was commissioned to arrange new music for the New Zealand national anthem ''[[God Defend New Zealand]]'', making it easier for the general public to sing.&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Di Piazza, ''New Zealand In Pictures'', Lerner Publications (30 September 2005), p=69&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued as Director of Music at St Mary's until his death on 22 May 1999.

==Awards==
Fernie was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1974 for his services to music. He received the [[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]] from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1989.

==The Maxwell Fernie Organ==
The organ at St Mary of the Angels was named after its designer and organist of 40 years, Maxwell Fernie in 2006.  The organ was originally built in 1958 by George Croft and Son Limited from [[Auckland]] to the tonal design and pipe-scaling of Maxwell Fernie, who also supervised the voicing of the pipes and the construction of the instrument.

According to Maxwell Fernie: "The organ possesses some unique features. The [[Flue pipe|Diapason]] choruses on both Swell and Great are of “constant scale” and wholly of Schultze-type voicing and scale with generous treble measurements. The swell-reed chorus is complete and independent, voiced in keeping with the large Gothic-type church which houses the three-manual and pedal instrument in the west gallery. The positive section contains probably the first examples of solo flute-mutations in New Zealand and the whole instrument is flexible in the extreme owing to a generous number of inter-manual and pedal couplers. Tonally it might be said that the organ, with mainly pipes from England and parts from Germany, the [[Netherlands]] and United States has a Continental flavour…acknowledging all schools of composition of the various periods and nationalities. It amply fulfils its prime function as a church organ, and various famous recitalists have praised its ability to enable them to ‘make music’, without tonal restrictions in their recitals.”

It is the only organ of its type in New Zealand. It comprises three manuals and pedals with some sixty-five speaking stops and a great many coupling options that give the instrument a unique flexibility to interchange the stops or sounds available between the manuals.

In 1984 the instrument was extensively rebuilt and extended by the [[South Island Organ Company]] of Timaru, once again to the specifications designed by Maxwell Fernie and under his careful supervision.

During the period following the 1984 rebuild, the organ suffered quite serious water and some rodent damage. This particularly affected the right-hand side of the instrument, the section containing parts of the Great, Positive and Pedal organ. Damage to the wind chests, some of the wooden pipes and to the electro-mechanical working of the organ affected the instrument to the extent that several ranks of pipes no longer functioned.

An appeal launched in December 2006 raised funds sufficient to restore the organ to its 1958 performance condition and also, to replace the original electrical circuitry with a modern computerised system. The appeal was coordinated by the Friends of St. Mary of the Angels Charitable Trust and involved the wider Wellington community. The organ was decommissioned by the South Island Organ Company following [[Easter]] 2006. The fully restored instrument was welcomed back at a celebration on 29 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smoa.org.nz/music/fernie.php St. Mary of the Angels: The Maxwell Fernie Organ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114033709/http://www.smoa.org.nz/music/fernie.php |date=14 January 2012 }}, retrieved 08-12-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which nowadays has a comparable level of scatter.&lt;ref&gt;Savorgnan, Giulia A. D.; Graham, Alister W. (2015), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.446.2330S Overmassive black holes in the MBH-σ diagram do not belong to over (dry) merged galaxies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giulia A.D. Savorgnan, et al. (2016), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...817...21S Supermassive Black Holes and Their Host Spheroids. II. The Red and Blue Sequence in the MBH-M*,sph Diagram]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''M''–''σ'' relation is generally interpreted as implying some source of mechanical [[feedback]] between the growth of supermassive black holes and the growth of galaxy bulges, although the source of this feedback is still uncertain.

Discovery of the M–σ relation was taken by many astronomers to imply that supermassive black holes are fundamental components of galaxies. Prior to about 2000, the main concern had been the simple detection of black holes, while afterward the interest changed to understanding the role of supermassive black holes as a critical component of galaxies. This led to the main uses of the relation to estimate black hole masses in galaxies that are too distant for direct mass measurements to be made, and to assay the overall black hole content of the Universe.

==Origin==
The tightness of the M–σ relation suggests that some kind of feedback acts to maintain the connection between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, in spite of processes like [[galaxy merger]]s and [[accretion (astronomy)|gas accretion]] that might be expected to increase the scatter over time.
One such mechanism was suggested by [[Joseph Silk]] and [[Martin Rees]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Silk, J. and Rees, M. (1998), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998A%26A...331L...1S  Quasars and galaxy formation], ''Astronomy and Astrophysics'', '''331''', L1–L4&lt;/ref&gt; These authors proposed a model in which supermassive black holes first form via collapse of giant 
gas clouds before most of the bulge mass has turned into stars. The black holes created in this way would then accrete and radiate, driving a wind which acts back on the accretion flow.
The flow would stall if the rate of deposition of mechanical energy into the infalling gas was large enough to unbind the protogalaxy in one [[crossing time]]. The Silk and Rees model predicts 
a slope for the M–σ relation of α=5, which is approximately correct. However, the predicted normalization of the relation is too small by about a factor of one thousand. The reason is that there is far more energy released in the formation of a supermassive black hole than is needed to completely unbind the stellar bulge.

A more successful feedback model was first presented by [[Andrew King (astronomer)|Andrew King]] at the [[University of Leicester]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=AKing&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Andrew|title=Black Holes, Galaxy Formation, and the MBH-σ Relation|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2003|volume=596|issue=1|pages=L27–L29|doi=10.1086/379143|arxiv = astro-ph/0308342 |bibcode = 2003ApJ...596L..27K }}&lt;/ref&gt; In King's model, feedback occurs through momentum transfer, rather than energy transfer as in the case of Silk &amp; Rees's model.  A "momentum-driven flow" is one in which the gas cooling time is so short that essentially all the energy in the flow is in the form of bulk motion. In such a flow, most of the energy released by the black hole is lost to radiation, and only a few percent is left to affect the gas mechanically. King's model predicts a slope of α=4 for the M–σ relation, and the normalization is exactly correct; it is roughly a factor c/σ ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; times larger than in Silk &amp; Rees's relation.

==Importance==
Before the M–σ relation was discovered in 2000, a large discrepancy existed between black hole masses derived using three techniques.&lt;ref name=MF01&gt;Merritt, D. and Ferrarese, L. (2001), Relationship of Black Holes to Bulges [http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March01/Merritt3/frames.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
''Direct,'' or dynamical, measurements based on the motion of stars or gas near the black hole seemed to give masses that averaged ~1% of the bulge mass (the "Magorrian relation"). Two other techniques—[[reverberation mapping]] in [[active galactic nuclei]], and the [[Soltan argument]], which computes the cosmological density in black holes needed to explain the [[quasar]] light—both gave a mean value of M/M&lt;sub&gt;bulge&lt;/sub&gt; that was a factor ~10 smaller than implied by the Magorrian relation. The M–σ relation resolved this discrepancy by showing that most of the direct black hole masses published prior to 2000 were significantly in error, presumably because the data on which they were based were of insufficient quality to resolve the black hole's dynamical [[sphere of influence (black hole)|sphere of influence]].&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David|title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9781400846122|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean ratio of black hole mass to bulge mass in big early-type galaxies is now believed to be approximately 1:200, and increasingly smaller as one moves to less massive galaxies.

A common use of the ''M''–''σ'' relation is to estimate black hole masses in distant galaxies using the easily  measured quantity σ. Black hole masses in thousands of galaxies have been estimated in this way. The M–σ relation is also used to calibrate so-called secondary and tertiary mass estimators, which relate the black hole mass to the strength of emission lines from hot gas in the nucleus or to the velocity dispersion of gas in the bulge.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, B. (2008), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008NewAR..52..240P  The central black hole and relationships with the host galaxy], ''New Astronomy Reviews'', '''52''', 240–252&lt;/ref&gt;

The tightness of the ''M''–''σ'' relation has led to suggestions that ''every'' bulge must contain a supermassive black hole. However, the number of galaxies in which the effect of the black hole's gravity on the motion of stars or gas is unambiguously seen is still quite small.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear whether the lack of black hole detections in many galaxies implies that these galaxies do not contain black holes; or that their masses are significantly below the value implied by the M–σ relation; or that the data are simply too poor to reveal the presence of the black hole.&lt;ref&gt;Valluri, M. et al.

No clear evidence has been found for ultra-massive black holes with masses above {{Solar mass|10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;}}, although this may be an expected consequence of the observed upper limit to σ.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Batcheldor|Batcheldor, D.]] et al.

The '''Optical Ground Station''' ('''OGS''') '''telescope''' (or '''ESA Space Debris Telescope'''), installed in the [[Teide Observatory]], has been built by [[Carl Zeiss]]. The telescope is ESA's [[Optical Ground Station]] forming a part of the [[Artemis (satellite)|Artemis]] experiment and is operated by the IAC ([[Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias]]) and Ataman Science S.L.U.

The telescope is a 1 m [[Ritchey-Chretien]] / Coudé telescope with field of view of 0.7 degrees, supported by an English-built mount inside a dome 12.5 metre in diameter. Its main purposes are: 
# to be the optical ground station of the [[Artemis (satellite)|Artemis telecommunications satellite]] (the project from which the telescope takes its name)
# to make surveys of [[space debris]] in different orbits around the Earth, 
# to test observing strategies of [[near-Earth object]]s as part of ESA's [[Space Situational Awareness programme]], and
# to make scientific astronomical night observations.

It is equipped with a cryogenically cooled mosaic CCD-Camera of 4k*4k pixels. The detection threshold is between 19th and 21st [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]], which corresponds to a capability to detect [[space debris]] objects as small as 10&amp;nbsp;cm in the [[geostationary ring]]. As a large part of the observation time is dedicated to space debris surveys, in particular the observation of [[space debris]] in the [[geostationary ring]] and in [[geostationary transfer orbit]]s, the term ESA Space Debris Telescope became used very frequently. Space debris surveys are carried out every month, centered on New Moon.

Since 2006, the telescope has also been used as a receiver station for quantum communication experiments (such as [[Bell test experiments| testing Bell inequalities]], [[quantum cryptography]], [[quantum teleportation]]), with the sender station being 143&amp;nbsp;km away in the [[Roque de los Muchachos Observatory|observatory on La&amp;nbsp;Palma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMLWO7YJ6H_index_0.html |title=ESA observatory breaks world quantum teleportation record |work=ESA press release |date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is possible because this telescope can be tilted to a near-horizontal position to point it at La&amp;nbsp;Palma, which many large astronomical telescopes are unable to do.

'''Paul Henry Lang''' (August 28, 1901 in [[Budapest]] – September 21, 1991 in [[Lakeville, Connecticut]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-[[United States|American]] [[musicologist]] and [[music critic]].

Lang was born in Budapest, [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and was educated in Catholic schools. In 1918, as World War I was coming to an end, he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army though he had not completed school, and sent to the Italian front.&lt;ref&gt;As told by PHL to family&lt;/ref&gt; When the war ended, he had to make his own way home, and then studied at the University of Budapest and the [[Budapest Music Academy]], under [[Zoltán Kodály]] and Erno Dohnanyi, among others. Kodály, learning that he only played piano, assigned him to learn to play the bassoon. After graduating in 1922, he was an assistant conductor at the Budapest Opera, but was encouraged to study musicology by Kodály and [[Béla Bartók]]. At that time serious study in musicology was only available in France and Germany. He began at the [[University of Heidelberg]] where he attended classes in philosophy and literature as well. He was not happy in Germany and moved on to the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris, where he studied with Andre Pirro. In the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] Lang participated as part of the French National rowing team. He supported himself by playing bassoon in various orchestras and also conducted an emigrant Hungarian chorus. While a student in Paris he began his career as a music critic, writing for the ''[[Revue Musicale]]''. He completed his dissertation on French lute music, but was not awarded his doctoral degree because he could not afford the large sum needed to engrave the unpublished scores he was discussing and print the dissertation, as required by the university.&lt;ref&gt;PHL oral history, 1981, at Columbia University Center for Oral History&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, knowing no English,&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Paul Henry Lang's wife, Anne Pecheux Lang, in letter to the ''New York Review of Books'', http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/mar/23/paul-henry-lang/. Retrieved July 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lang moved to the United States as a junior scholar of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. He took a few English classes and then picked up more from motion pictures. He taught music, including harmony and counterpoint, for a year at [[Vassar College]] (1930–31), filling in for a professor on sabbatical. Then at [[Wells College]] (1932–34), he taught music history and analysis and led the chapel choir. At the same time he worked on a dissertation on the literary history of French opera,earning a [[doctorate degree]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1934. Having by now published a few articles in English, he was invited to teach at both Wellesley College and Columbia. For one year he taught at both colleges. Mr. Lang joined the music faculty of Columbia University in 1934 with the first professorship of musicology in America,&lt;ref&gt;Anne Pecheux Lang letter,&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly began changing the way music was taught there by adding courses, such as the esthetics of music, and by expanding the musicology department. In 1940, after Bartók fled Hungary during [[World War II]], Lang arranged for Columbia to hire him as an ethnomusicologist. As musicology was a nascent field at the time, Lang had a strong influence on its development, especially in the United States, and advised a number of students who would go on to become prominent musicologists, including [[James McKinnon]], [[Dika Newlin]], [[Joel Sachs]], [[Rose Rosengard Subotnik]], [[Richard Taruskin]], [[Piero Weiss]], and [[Neal Zaslaw]].

Lang became best known for his often provocative articles and books on both contemporary trends in music and music history. He was from 1954 to 1964 the music critic for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', succeeding [[Virgil Thomson]], and was editor of ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'' from 1945 to 1973. He published a number of books, the most famous of which is ''[[Music in Western Civilization]]'' (1941), called "[a] model of scholarship and style"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Age of Faith|last = Durant|first = Will|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster|year = 1950|isbn =|location = New York|pages = 1094}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Will Durant]]. He was an adviser to his publisher, W.W. Norton, and edited several books for them. He was a founding member of the American Musicological Society and in 1955 was elected for a term as president of the International Musicological Society.

In addition to his most famous work,  ''[[Music in Western Civilization]]'', Lang wrote  ''George Frideric Handel, '' collaborated with Otto Bettmann on ''A Pictorial History of Music,'' and edited several compilations, including  ''The Creative World of Mozart'' and  ''One Hundred Years of Music in America.''

In 1936 he married Anne Pecheux, a Barnard graduate who had taken his undergraduate music history course.  They had four children.

A director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists, Peter Faletra, suggested the change from the older acronym SMET to STEM. Colwell, expressing some dislike for the older acronym, responded by suggesting NSF institute the change. However, the acronym STEM predates NSF and likely traces its origin to Charles Vela, the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/about.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - About CAHSEE|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stem.ccny.cuny.edu/|title=STEM Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics - Main|website=stem.ccny.cuny.edu|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqnRETS9FWwC|title=Hispanic Engineer &amp; IT|last=Group|first=Career Communications|date=1996|publisher=Career Communications Group|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Geographic distribution==

===United States===

In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum.&lt;ref name="STEM PA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iu1stemcenter.org/files/CMU_and_IU_STEM_Survey.pdf |title=STEM Education in Southwestern Pennsylvania |year=2008 |publisher=The Intermediate Unit 1 Center for STEM Education |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the [[public education]] agenda of the United States.&lt;ref name="USNEWS2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/stem-education/2012/07/26/us-news-inducts-five-to-stem-leadership-hall-of-fame |title=U.S. News Inducts Five to STEM Leadership Hall of Fame |date=July 26, 2012 |author=Morella, Michael |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States [[work visa]]s for [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] who are skilled in these fields. It has also become commonplace in education discussions as a reference to the shortage of skilled workers and inadequate education in these areas.&lt;ref name="Bill Clinton Lays Out"&gt;{{cite news

====National Science Foundation====
Many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field. The NSF uses a broader definition of STEM subjects that includes subjects in the fields of [[chemistry]], [[Computer science|computer]] and [[information technology]] science, engineering, geosciences, life sciences, mathematical sciences, physics and astronomy, [[social sciences]] ([[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]), and STEM education and learning research.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12599/nsf12599.htm#appendix|title=Graduate Research Fellowship Program|work=nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligibility for scholarship programs such as the CSM STEM Scholars Program use the NSF definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmd.edu/istem/scholarship_stem.html |title=ISTEM – College of Southern Maryland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSF is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/what.jsp |title=What We Do |publisher=The National Science Foundation |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its disciplinary program areas include scholarships, grants, fellowships in fields such as biological sciences, computer and [[information science]] and  engineering, education and human resources, engineering, environmental research and education, geosciences, international science and engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioral and economic sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and polar programs.&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"/&gt;

====Immigration policy====
Although many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) has its own functional definition used for immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42530.pdf|format=PDF|title=Immigration of Foreign Nationals with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Degrees|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, DHS or ICE announced an expanded list of STEM designated-degree programs that qualify eligible graduates on student visas for an optional practical training (OPT) extension. Under the OPT program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States are able to remain in the country and receive training through work experience for up to 12 months. Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program can remain for an additional 17 months on an OPT STEM extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DHS Expands List of STEM designated-degree programs|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/dhs-expands-list-stem-designated-degree-programs |publisher=Fowler White Boggs P.A. |author=Jennifer G.

An exhaustive list of STEM disciplines does not exist because the definition varies by organization. The [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] lists disciplines including&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ice.gov/sevis/stemlist.htm |title=STEM Designated Degree Programs |date=April 2008 |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physics]], [[actuarial science]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mathematics]], [[applied mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[computational science]], [[psychology]], [[biochemistry]], [[robotics]], [[computer engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[information science]], [[information technology]], [[civil engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[astrophysics]], [[astronomy]], [[optics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[nuclear physics]], [[mathematical biology]], [[operations research]], [[neurobiology]], [[biomechanics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[geographic information system]]s, [[atmospheric sciences]], [[Educational technology|educational/instructional technology]], [[software engineering]], and [[educational research]].

====Education====
By cultivating an interest in the natural and social sciences in preschool or immediately following school entry, the chances of STEM success in high school can be greatly improved. [[School segregation|School integration]] can  help black, Hispanic and aboriginal students catch up with Asian and white students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

STEM supports broadening the study of [[engineering]] within each of the other subjects, and beginning engineering at younger grades, even elementary school. It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs. In his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the "''Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)''" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/02/obamas-budget-shuffles-stem.html |title=Obama's Budget Shuffles STEM Education Deck |date=14 February 2012 |author=Jane J.

In the 2015 run of the international assessment test the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), American students came out 35th in mathematics, 24th in reading and 25th in science, out of 109 countries. The United States also ranked 29th in the percentage of 24-year-olds with science or mathematics degrees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/|title=Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) - Overview|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

STEM education often uses new technologies such as [[RepRap]] [[3D printers]] to encourage interest in STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Irwin, D.E. Oppliger, J.M. Pearce, G. Anzalone, [http://www.asee.org/file_server/papers/attachment/file/0005/4988/asee_K-12_2015_finalpaper.pdf Evaluation of RepRap 3D Printer Workshops in K-12 STEM]. ''122nd ASEE 122nd ASEE Conf.

In 2006 the [[United States National Academies]] expressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States. Its Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy developed a list of 10 actions. Their top three recommendations were to:
* Increase America's talent pool by improving K–12 science and mathematics education
* Strengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science, mathematics and technology
* Enlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|title=STEM Education|website=Slsd.org|access-date=2016-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126095634/http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] also has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education in order to replenish the pool of scientists, engineers and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Individual states, such as [[California]], have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powerofdiscovery.org/sites/default/files/cde_report_task_10_and_11.pdf|format=PDF|title=Final Report : California Department of Education : CDE Agreement|website=Powerofdiscovery.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another state to invest in STEM education is Florida, where [https://floridapolytechnic.org/ Florida Polytechnic University], Florida’s first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About Florida Polytechnic University|url = https://floridapolytechnic.org/about/|website = Florida Polytechnic University|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During school, STEM programs have been established for many districts throughout the U.S.  Some states include [[New Jersey]], [[Arizona]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], and [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/domain/1012|title=STEM Academy / Overview|website=www.olentangy.k12.oh.us|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings/stem|title=Best STEM High schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing STEM education has expanded to the post-secondary level through masters programs such as the University of Maryland's STEM Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910215842/http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the University of Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200320/http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial gap in STEM fields====
In the United States, the National Science Foundation found that the average science score on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress was lower for black and Hispanic students than white, Asian, and Pacific Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;"Science and Engineering Indicators 2014." S&amp;E Indicators 2014 - Figures - US National Science Foundation (NSF). N.p., n.d.

Disparities in STEM Employment by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin . Rep. N.p.: n.p., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Though STEM in the U.S. has typically been dominated by white males, there have been considerable efforts to create initiatives to make STEM a more racially and gender diverse field.&lt;ref&gt;"FACT SHEET: President Obama Announces Over $240 Million in New STEM Commitments at the 2015 White House Science Fair." National Archives and Records Administration. National Archives and Records Administration, n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some evidence suggests that all students, including black and Hispanic students, have a better chance of earning a STEM degree if they attend a college or university at which their entering academic credentials are at least as high as the average student's.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Heriot, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3112683 Want to Be a Doctor?

====American Competitiveness Initiative====
In the [[State of the Union Address]] on January 31, 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] announced the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]]. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced [[R&amp;D]] programs (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines.

The ''NASA Means Business'' competition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education.

The [[National Science Foundation]] has numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some [[Arizona]] schools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields.

The STEM Academy is a national nonprofit-status organization dedicated to improving STEM literacy for all students. It represents a recognized national next-generation high-impact academic model. The practices, strategies, and programming are built upon a foundation of identified national best practices which are designed to improve under-represented minority and low-income student growth, close achievement gaps, decrease dropout rates, increase high school graduation rates and improve teacher and principal effectiveness. The STEM Academy represents a flexible use academic model that targets all schools and is for all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stem101.org/about.asp|title=stemacademy|website=Stem101.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project Lead The Way]] (PLTW) is a leading provider of STEM education curricular programs to middle and high schools in the United States. The national nonprofit organization has over 5,200 programs in over 4,700 schools in all 50 states. Programs include a high school engineering curriculum called ''Pathway To Engineering'', a high school biomedical sciences program, and a middle school engineering and technology program called ''Gateway To Technology''. PLTW provides the curriculum and the teacher professional development and ongoing support to create transformational programs in schools, districts, and communities. PLTW programs have been endorsed by President [[Barack Obama]] and [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] as well as various state, national, and business leaders.

Department of Education]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and other agencies that offer STEM-related programs. Activity of the STEM Coalition seems to have slowed since September 2008.

====Scouting====
In 20102, the [[Boy Scouts of America]] began handing out awards, titled NOVA and SUPERNOVA, for completing specific requirements appropriate to scouts' program level in each of the four main STEM areas. The [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] has similarly incorporated STEM into their program through the introduction of merit badges such as "Naturalist" and "Digital Art".&lt;ref name="STEM - Girl Scouts"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.girlscouts.org/en/about-girl-scouts/girl-scouts-and-stem.html|title=STEM - Girl Scouts|website=Girl Scouts of the USA|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[eCybermission]] is a free, web-based science, mathematics and technology competition for students in grades six through nine sponsored by the U.S. Army. Each [[webinar]] is focused on a different step of the scientific method and is presented by an experienced eCybermission CyberGuide. CyberGuides are military and civilian volunteers with a strong background in STEM and STEM education, who are able to provide valuable insight into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to students and team advisers.

[[STARBASE]] is a premier educational program, sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs. Students interact with military personnel to explore careers and make connections with the "real world." The program provides students with 20–25 hours of stimulating experiences at [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], [[Air Force Reserve]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] bases across the nation.

[[SeaPerch]] is an innovative underwater robotics program that trains teachers to teach their students how to build an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in an in-school or out-of-school setting. Students build the ROV from a kit composed of low-cost, easily accessible parts, following a curriculum that teaches basic engineering and science concepts with a marine engineering theme.

====NASA====
NASAStem is a program of the U.S. [[space agency]] [[NASA]] to increase diversity within its ranks, including age, disability, and gender as well as race/ethnicity.&lt;ref name="NASAStem"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://missionstem.nasa.gov/diversity-inclusion-leadrshp.html|title=NASA Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity (ODEO)|website=missionstem.nasa.gov|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation====
The [[America COMPETES Act]] (P.L. 110-69) became law on August 9, 2007. It is intended to increase the nation's investment in science and engineering research and in STEM education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education. The act authorizes funding increases for the [[National Science Foundation]], [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] laboratories, and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) Office of Science over FY2008–FY2010. Robert Gabrys, Director of Education at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], articulated success as increased student achievement, early expression of student interest in STEM subjects, and student preparedness to enter the workforce.

====Jobs====
In November 2012 the [[White House]] announcement before congressional vote on the STEM Jobs Act put President Obama in opposition to many of the Silicon Valley firms and executives who bankrolled his re-election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57556074-38/obama-opposes-silicon-valley-firms-on-immigration-reform/ |title=Obama opposes Silicon Valley firms on immigration reform |date=November 28, 2012 |author=Declan McCullagh |publisher=CNET |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Labor identified 14 sectors that are "projected to add substantial numbers of new jobs to [[Economy of the United States|the economy]] or affect the growth of other industries or are being transformed by technology and innovation requiring new sets of skills for workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doleta.gov/Youth_services/pdf/STEM_Report_4%2007.pdf |title=The STEM Workforce Challenge: the Role of the Public Workforce System in a National Solution for a Competitive Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Workforce |date=April 2007 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The identified sectors were as follows: [[advanced manufacturing]], [[Automotive]], [[Construction industry|construction]], [[financial services]], [[geospatial technology]], [[homeland security]], [[information technology]], [[Transportation]], [[Aerospace]], [[Biotechnology]], [[Energy industry|energy]], [[Health care industry|healthcare]], [[Hospitality industry|hospitality]], and [[Retail industry|retail]].

The [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] notes STEM fields careers are some of the best-paying and have the greatest potential for job growth in the early 21st century. The report also notes that STEM workers play a key role in the sustained growth and stability of the U.S. economy, and training in STEM fields generally results in higher wages, whether or not they work in a STEM field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/Reports/stem-good-jobs-now-and-future|title=STEM: Good Jobs Now and For the Future|work=doc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, there were around 9.0 million STEM jobs in the United States, representing 6.1% of American employment. STEM jobs were increasing around 9% percent per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/stem-jobs-2017-update|title=STEM Jobs: 2017 Update {{!}} Economics &amp; Statistics Administration|website=www.esa.doc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Brookings Institution found that the demand for competent technology graduates will surpass the number of capable applicants by at least one million individuals.  The BLS noted that almost 100 percent of STEM jobs require postsecondary education, while only 36 percent of other jobs call for that same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/2188-building-americas-future-stem-education/for-students/blog/news.php|title=Building America’s Future: STEM Education Intervention is a Win-Win|website=Penn Wharton Public Policy Initative|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Updates ====
PEW findings revealed that Americans identified several issues that hound STEM education which included unconcerned parents, disinterested students, obsolete curriculum materials, and too much focus on state parameters. 57 percent of survey respondents pointed out that one main problem of STEM is lack of students’ concentration in learning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/2018/01/12/americans-rate-u.s.-stem-education-as-mediocre.aspx|title=Americans Rate U.S. K–12 STEM Education as Mediocre -- THE Journal|website=THE Journal|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) report card&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/tel/|title=NAEP TEL - Technology and Engineering Literacy Assessment|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; made public technology as well as engineering literacy scores which determines whether students have the capability to apply technology and engineering proficiency to real-life scenarios. The report showed a gap of 28 points between low-income students and their high-income counterparts. The same report also indicated a 38-point difference between white and black students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/09/25/suddenly-trump-wants-to-spend-millions-of-dollars-on-stem-in-public-schools/|title=Analysis {{!}} Suddenly, Trump wants to spend millions of dollars on STEM in public schools|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The 2019 fiscal budget proposal of the White House supported the funding plan in President Donald Trump’s Memorandum on STEM Education which allocated around $200 million (grant funding) on STEM education every year. This budget also supports STEM through a grant program worth $20 million for career as well as technical education programs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edscoop.com/trump-stands-by-stem-education-spending-in-fy19-budget|title=Trump stands by STEM education spending in fiscal 2019 budget|website=EdScoop|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In September 2017, a number of large American technology firms collectively pledged to donate $300 million for computer science education in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/technology/computer-science-stem-education.html|title=Tech Firms Add $300 Million to Trump Administration’s Computer Science Push|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peer country with the greatest proportion of STEM graduates, [[Finland]], has over 30% of their university graduates coming from science, mathematics, computer science, and engineering programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/details/education/graduates-science-math-computer-science-engineerin.aspx|title=Graduates in science, math, computer science, and engineering|website=Conferenceboard.ca|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SHAD is an annual Canadian summer enrichment program for high-achieving [[high school]] students in July. The program focuses on academic learning particularly in STEAM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shad.ca/userContent/documents/SHAD_BROCHURE_EN.pdf|title=SHAD Brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scouts Canada]] has taken similar measures to their American counterpart to promote STEM fields to youth. Their STEM program began in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scouts.ca/stem/activities.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811173225/http://www.scouts.ca/stem/activities.html |archivedate=2014-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Canadian entrepreneur and philanthropist [[Seymour Schulich]] established the [[Schulich Leader Scholarships]], $100 million in $60,000 scholarships for students beginning their university education in a STEM program at 20 institutions across Canada. Each year 40 Canadian students would be selected to receive the award, two at each institution, with the goal of attracting gifted youth into the STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toronto philanthropist Schulich unveils $100-million scholarship |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/toronto-philanthropist-schulich-unveils-100-million-scholarship/article2201382/|website=Theglobeandmail.com|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program also supplies STEM scholarships to five participating universities in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philanthropist Makes $100 Million Investment In Nation’s Future|url=http://www.shalomlife.com/news/16038/philanthropist-makes-100-million-investment-in-nations-future/|website=Shalomlife.com|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Several European projects have promoted STEM education and careers in Europe. For instance, Scientix&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientix Project|url=http://www.scientix.eu/|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a European cooperation of STEM teachers, education scientists, and policymakers. The SciChallenge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Achilleos|first1=Achilleas|last2=Mettouris|first2=Christos|last3=Yeratziotis|first3=Alexandros|last4=Papadopoulos|first4=George|last5=Pllana|first5=Sabri|last6=Huber|first6=Florian|last7=Jaeger|first7=Bernhard|last8=Leitner|first8=Peter|last9=Ocsovszky|first9=Zsofia|last10=Dinnyes|first10=Andras|title=SciChallenge: A Social Media Aware Platform for Contest-Based STEM Education and Motivation of Young Students|journal=IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies|date=March 2018|doi=10.1109/TLT.2018.2810879|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8305513/?reload=true|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; project used a social media contest and the student-generated content to increase motivation of pre- university students for STEM education and careers.

=== Hong Kong ===
STEM education has not been promoted among the local schools in Hong Kong until recent years. In November 2015, the Education Bureau of Hong Kong released a document entitled ''Promotion of STEM Education'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/curriculum-development/renewal/Brief%20on%20STEM%20(Overview)_eng_20151105.pdf|format=PDF|title=Promotion of STEM Education |website=Edb.gov.hk|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposes the strategies and recommendations on promoting STEM education.

===Turkey===
Turkish STEM Education Task Force (or FeTeMM—Fen Bilimleri, Teknoloji, Mühendislik ve Matematik) is a coalition of academicians and teachers who show an effort to increase the quality of education in STEM fields rather than focussing on increasing the number of STEM graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FeTeMM Çalışma Grubu|url=http://fetemm.org/|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STEM Education Task Force|url=http://tstem.com/|website=Tstem.com |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qatar===
In [[Qatar]], [[AL-Bairaq]] is an outreach program to high-school students with a curriculum that focuses on STEM, run by the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at [[Qatar University]]. Each year around 946 students, from about 40 high schools, participate in AL-Bairaq competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php|title=AlBairaq World - Welcome to Al-Bairaq World|date=19 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=20 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php|archivedate=19 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AL-Bairaq make use of project-based learning, encourages students to solve authentic problems, and inquires them to work with each other as a team to build real solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=3405|title=Supreme Education Council|website=Sec.gov.qa|accessdate=2017-08-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630045928/http://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=3405|archivedate=2017-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/283245/al-bairaq-holds-workshop-for-high-school-students|title=The Peninsula Qatar - Al Bairaq holds workshop for high school students|website=Thepeninsulaqatar.com|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has so far shown positive results for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejes.eu/images/issue/vol.1/no.3/4.pdf|title=Al-Ghanim, K.A; Al-Maadeed, M.A and Al-Thani, N.J (Sept. 2014) : IMPACT OF INNOVATIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT BASED ON RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ON SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS' ATTITUDE TOWARDS RESEARCH AND THEIR SELF-EFFICACY, EJES, 1(3), 39-57|website=Ejes.eu|accessdate=2017-08-20}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, beginning in 2012 many private education organizations has STEM education initiatives.

In 2015, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Liên minh STEM organized the first National STEM day, followed by many similar events across the country.

in 2015, Ministry of Education and Training included STEM as an area needed to be encouraged in national school year program.

In May 2017, Prime Minister signed a [http://vanban.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/chinhphu/hethongvanban?class_id=2&amp;mode=detail&amp;document_id=189610 Directive no. 16] stating: "Dramatically change the policies, contents, education and vocational training methods to create a human resource capable of receiving new production technology trends, with a focus on promoting training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), foreign languages, information technology in general education; " and asking "Ministry of Education and Training (to): Promote the deployment of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in general education program; Pilot organize in some high schools from 2017 to 2018.

==Women==
[[File:Woman teaching geometry.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|&lt;center&gt;"Woman teaching geometry"&lt;/center&gt; Illustration at the beginning of a [[medieval]] translation of Euclid's ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' ({{circa|1310 AD}})]]
{{main article|Female education in STEM|Women in STEM fields}}
{{see also|Women in science|Women in engineering|Women in computing|Sex differences in psychology|Sex differences in intelligence}}

Women constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce, and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/women-stem-2017-update|title=Women in STEM: 2017 Update| access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|title=Science careers face diversity challenge|work=westminster.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018110732/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|archivedate=2014-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts.

The gender ratio depends on field of study. For example, in the [[European Union]] in 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 15 September 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism. In the 2014 article "The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage" in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', demographer Michael S. Teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the U.S. government to increase the number of STEM graduates, saying that, among studies on the subject, "No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher", and that "Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations." Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U.S. government efforts since [[World War II]] to increase the number of scientists and engineers, all of which he stated ultimately ended up in "mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and funding cuts"; including one driven by the [[Space Race]] of the late 1950s and 1960s, which he wrote led to "a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/ |first=Michael S. |last=Teitelbaum |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' contributing editor Robert N. Charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth", also noting that there was a "mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job" in the United States, with only around ¼ of STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |first=Robert N. |last=Charette |publisher=IEEE Spectrum |date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics writer Ben Casselman, in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings for ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', wrote that, based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, "many sciences, particularly the [[life sciences]], pay below the overall median for recent college graduates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/ |first=Ben |last=Casselman |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |date=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to remedy the perceived domination of STEM subjects by men of Asian and non-Hispanic European backgrounds has led to intense efforts to diversify the STEM workforce. However, some critics feel that this practice in higher education, as opposed to a strict [[meritocracy]], causes lower academic standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[spatial statistics]], the '''empirical semivariance''' is described by
semivariance=1/2(z(x)-z(x))^2 where z is the attribute value 

where ''z'' is a [[data|datum]] at a particular location, ''h'' is the distance between ordered data, and ''n''(''h'') is the number of paired data at a distance of ''h''. The semivariance is half the variance of the increments &lt;math&gt;z(x_i+h)-z(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;, but the whole variance of z-values at given separation distance ''h'' (Bachmaier and Backes, 2008).

A plot of semivariances versus distances between ordered data in a graph is known as a [[semivariogram]] rather than a [[variogram]]. Many authors call &lt;math&gt;2\hat\gamma(h)&lt;/math&gt; a variogram, others use the terms variogram and semivariogram synonymously. However,  Bachmaier and Backes (2008), who discussed this confusion, have shown that &lt;math&gt;\hat\gamma(h)&lt;/math&gt; should be called a variogram, terms like semivariogram or semivariance should be avoided.

'''''Show Me!''''' is a [[sex education]] book by photographer [[Will McBride (photographer)|Will McBride]]. It appeared in 1974 in German under the title ''Zeig Mal!'', written with [[psychiatrist]] Helga Fleischhauer-Hardt for children and their parents. It was translated into English a year later and was widely available in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic for many years, but later became subject to expanded [[child pornography]] laws in jurisdictions including the United States. In Germany, the book was followed in 1990 by a second edition that included, among other additions, a discussion of the [[AIDS]] epidemic.

==Publication history==
While many parents appreciated ''Show Me!'' for its frank depiction of pre-adolescents discovering and exploring their [[Child sexuality|sexuality]], others called it [[child pornography]]. In 1975 and 1976, [[obscenity]] charges were brought against the publisher by prosecutors in [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. In all four cases, the judges ruled as a matter of law that the title was not [[obscene]].

However, starting in 1977, some states began to criminalize the distribution of even ''non-obscene'' so-called "child pornography," or "images of abuse," which arguably is not protected by [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|the First Amendment.]] [[New York (state)|New York]] State, home of the publisher, [[St. Martin's Press]], criminalized the distribution of non-obscene "child pornography" in 1977, but the publisher promptly went to court and obtained an [[injunction]] against the State.  The court granted the injunction because the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] was interpreted to permit the banning of only obscene material.

In 1982, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] issued a decision, ''[[New York v. Ferber]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=458&amp;invol=747 New York v. Ferber], Findlaw.com&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed the government to constitutionally ban the knowing distribution of even non-obscene "child pornography". Citing a [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]], St. Martin's Press then pulled the book, stating that though they believed  ''Show Me!'' was not [[pornographic]], they could no longer afford the legal expenses to defend it, and they did not want to risk criminal prosecutions of their own personnel and/or vendors who sold the book.    The Court overruled a decision of the [[New York Court of Appeals]], ''The People  v. Paul Ira Ferber''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15562951158866016402], which held that  [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|the First Amendment]] protected the dissemination of non-obscene sexual depictions. ''Show Me!'' was not the direct subject of the ''Ferber'' case, but the book was prominently featured by both sides in the litigation, and it played a significant role in the [[oral argument]] before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1981/1981_81_55/argument/ Oral argument] at Oyez.org. Accessed 23 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In its country of origin, Germany, the book first won several awards, even from church organisations, but due to rising pressure from a newly arising "moral majority" the publishers and McBride decided to take it off the market in 1996. By then over one million copies in seven languages had been sold. It was never officially banned in Germany. Public libraries there keep it on hand and out of print copies are openly sold at collectors' premium prices.

In New Zealand the book was banned by the [[Indecent Publications Tribunal]] in 1976. The ban was upheld in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Censorship Database|url=http://www.censorship.govt.nz/DDA/Pages/Screens/DDA/WelcomePage.aspx|publisher=Office of Film &amp; Literature Classification. 1976 Publication No. IPT 76-860.  1996 Publication No. 9400964|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Show Me!'' received mixed reviews from the mass media when it was first published. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the photographs "beautiful...graceful, charming, and elegant," yet accurately predicted, in a severe understatement of what actually happened, that the book "may start (an) uproar."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/656022932.html?dids=656022932:656022932&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Mar+9%2C+1975&amp;author=ROBERT+A+JONES&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(1886-Current+File)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=F6&amp;desc=IS+AMERICA+READY%3F Is America Ready?]", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 9, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', on the other hand, described the photographs as "beautiful, assaultive, grotesque, and seductive," and concluded that ''Show Me!'' was only suited for "avant garde" parents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/120123914.html?dids=120123914:120123914&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;fmac=&amp;date=May+4%2C+1975&amp;author=By+T.+BERRY+BRAZELTON&amp;desc=Kiss+the+Stork+Goodbye "Kiss the Stork Goodbye]," ''[[Washington Post]]'' May 5, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Linda Wolfe was more hostile in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', calling the book a "child-abusive joke."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/13/archives/the-birds-and-the-bees-were-never-like-this-show-me.html The birds and the bees were never like this]", ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' July 13, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The 13-year-old daughter of [[Chicago Tribune]] reviewer Carol Kleiman commented:

::"I'm too old for it myself. The last part, though, with no pictures, looks interesting to read. The book is good for little kids because they don't know what society terms 'dirty' yet. You know, Mom, it's PARENTS I'm worried about. '''''They're''''' not ready yet."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/639825622.html?dids=639825622:639825622&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jul+5%2C+1975&amp;author=Carol+Kleiman&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune+(1963-Current+file)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=S11&amp;desc=New+sex+ed%3A+All+kids+ever+wanted+to+know...and+how!  New sex ed: All kids ever wanted to know...and how!]", ''Chicago Tribune'', July 5, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent reviews===
A 2005 Amazon review by Dr. [[Russell A. Rohde]] claims that the book, "appropriately delves into the issues of breast feeding, adolescence, pubertal changes, menses, sexual anatomies, pregnancy, masturbation, contraception, sexual behavioral disturbances and venereal disease. [...] I am not aware of any book comparable to this illustrated primer that fills the needs of sexual education so well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Show-Me-Picture-Children-Parents/dp/0312722753|author=Russell A. Rohde MD|quote=5.0 out of 5 stars|title="Show Me!"...unique, explicit &amp; sadly controversial...|date=February 17, 2005|publisher=Amazon.com}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[D. F. Janssen]] places it at the one extreme of a late 20th-century visual and textual revolution that enabled parents to illustrate information that up to that time had been transmitted orally. He sees the work as subversive not for its "too frank" portrayal of childhood sexuality, but instead for the primacy that the image takes over the text. In his eyes, the work "comes out of a culture with a long history of pathologising so-addressed '[[primal scene]]s,'" a history that became manifest in particular with regard to the works of Will McBride.&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Janssen, ''[http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/GUS/GUSVOLIICH18.HTM#_Toc70961575 Growing Up Sexually. Volume II: The Sexual Curriculum: The Manufacture and Performance of Pre-Adult Sexualities]'' (October 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is also analyzed in an article on "Picturing Sex Education" (Discourse Volume 27, Number 4 / December 2006).

[[Image:Cubic Zirconia Run Opening.jpg|thumb|Cubic zirconia "run" being opened]]
The '''skull crucible''' process was developed at the [[Lebedev Physical Institute]] in [[Moscow]] to manufacture [[cubic zirconia]]. It was invented to solve the problem of cubic zirconia's melting-point being too high for even platinum [[crucible]]s. 

In essence, by heating only the center of a volume of cubic zirconia, the material forms its own "crucible" from its cooler outer layers. The term "skull" refers to these outer layers forming a shell enclosing the molten volume. [[Zirconium oxide]] powder is heated then gradually allowed to cool. Heating is accomplished by [[radio frequency induction]] using a coil wrapped around the apparatus.  The outside of the device is [[Water jacket|water-cooled]] in order to keep the RF coil from melting and also to cool the outside of the zirconium oxide and thus maintain the shape of the zirconium powder.
 
Since zirconium oxide in its solid state [[Insulator (electrical)|does not conduct]] electricity, a piece of [[zirconium]] metal is placed inside the gob of zirconium oxide. As the zirconium melts it oxidizes and blends with the now molten zirconium oxide, a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], and is heated by RF induction.

When the zirconium oxide is melted on the inside (but not completely, since the outside needs to remain solid) the amplitude of the RF induction coil is gradually reduced and [[crystal]]s form as the material cools. Normally this would form a [[monoclinic crystal system]] of zirconium oxide. 

In order to maintain a [[cubic crystal system]] a stabilizer is added, [[magnesium oxide]], [[calcium oxide]] or [[yttrium oxide]] as well as any material to color the crystal. After the mixture cools the outer shell is broken off and the interior of the gob is then used to manufacture [[gemstone]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19675">A '''luminous supersoft X-ray source''' (SSXS, or SSS) is an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] source that emits only low energy (i.e., soft) [[X-rays]]. Soft X-rays have energies in the 0.09 to 2.5 [[keV]] range, whereas hard X-rays are in the 1–20 keV range.&lt;ref name=Supersoft&gt;{{ cite web |title=Supersoft X-Ray Sources |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/27930/supersoft.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607122110/http://library.thinkquest.org/27930/supersoft.htm |archivedate=2008-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSSs emit few or no photons with energies above 1 keV, and most have effective temperatures below 100 eV. This means that the radiation they emit is highly ionizing and is readily absorbed by the interstellar medium. Most SSSs within our own galaxy are hidden by interstellar absorption in the galactic disk.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; They are readily evident in external galaxies, with ~10 found in the Magellanic Clouds and at least 15 seen in M31.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

As of early 2005, more than 100 SSSs have been reported in ~20 external galaxies, the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC), [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] (SMC), and the [[Milky Way]] (MW).&lt;ref name=Kahabka/&gt; Those with luminosities below ~3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s are consistent with steady [[Stellar surface fusion|nuclear burning]] in accreting [[white dwarf]]s (WD)s or post-novae.&lt;ref name=Kahabka/&gt; There are a few SSS with luminosities ≥10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s.&lt;ref name=Kahabka/&gt;

Super soft X-rays are believed to be produced by steady [[nuclear fusion]] on a [[white dwarf]]'s surface of material pulled from a [[binary star|binary companion]],&lt;ref name=SSXSmpe&gt;{{ cite web |title=Super Soft X-ray Sources - Discovered with ROSAT |url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~jcg/sss/sss_high.html |author=Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt; the so-called close-binary supersoft source (CBSS).&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt; This requires a flow of material sufficiently high to sustain the fusion. Contrast this with the [[nova]], where less flow causes the material to only fuse sporadically.

==Close-binary supersoft source (CBSS)==

The CBSS model invokes steady [[Stellar surface fusion|nuclear burning on the surface]] of an accreting [[white dwarf]] (WD) as the generator of the prodigious super soft X-ray flux.&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt; As of 1999, eight SSXSs have orbital periods between ~4 hr and 1.35 d: RX J0019.8+2156 (MW), [[RX J0439.8−6809|RX J0439.8-6809]] (MW halo near LMC), RX J0513.9-6951 (LMC), RX J0527.8-6954 (LMC), RX J0537.7-7034 (LMC), CAL 83 (LMC), CAL 87 LMC), and 1E 0035.4-7230 (SMC).&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt;

==Symbiotic binary==
{{main|Symbiotic variable star}}
A '''symbiotic binary''' star is a [[variable star|variable]] [[binary star]] system in which a [[red giant]] has expanded its outer envelope and is [[stellar wind|shedding mass]] quickly, and another hot star (often a [[white dwarf]]) is ionizing the gas.&lt;ref name=Darling&gt;{{ cite web |title=David Darling site symbiotic star description |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/symbiotic_star.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three symbiotic binaries as of 1999 are SSXSs: AG Dra (BB, MW), [[RR Telescopii|RR Tel]] (WD, MW), and RX J0048.4-7332 (WD, SMC).&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt;

==Noninteracting white dwarfs==

The youngest, hottest WD, [[KPD 0005+5106]], is very close to 100,000 K, of type DO and is the first single WD recorded as an X-ray source with ROSAT.&lt;ref name=Fleming&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Fleming TA|author2=Werner K |author3=Barstow MA |journal=Astrophys.

Apparently the only SSXS nonmagnetic cataclysmic variable is [[V Sagittae]]: bolometric luminosity of (1–10) x 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;, a binary including a blackbody (BB) accretor at T &lt; 80 eV, and an orbital period of 0.514195 d.&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt;

The accretion disk can become thermally stable in systems with high mass-transfer rates (Ṁ).&lt;ref name=Kato/&gt; Such systems are called nova-like (NL) stars, because they lack outbursts characteristic of dwarf novae.&lt;ref name=Osaki&gt;{{ cite journal |doi=10.1086/133689 |last1=Osaki |first1=Yoji |title=Dwarf-Nova Outbursts |journal=Publ.

==VY Scl cataclysmic variables==

Among the NL stars is a small group which shows a temporary reduction or cessation of Ṁ from the secondary. These are the VY Scl-type stars or anti-dwarf novae.&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;{{ cite book |author=Warner B |date=1995 |title=Cataclysmic Variable Stars |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |bibcode=1995cvs..book.....W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===V751 Cyg===

V751 Cyg (BB, MW) is a VY Scl CV, has a bolometric luminosity of 6.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s,&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt; and emits soft X-rays at quiescence.&lt;ref name=Patterson&gt;{{ cite journal |doi=10.1086/317973 |display-authors=4 |author=Patterson J |author2=Thorstensen JR |author3=Fried R|author4=Skillman DR |author5=Cook LM |author6=Jensen L |title=Superhumps in Cataclysmic Binaries.

Pac. |date=Jan 2001 |volume=113 |issue=779 |pages=72–81 |bibcode=2001PASP..113...72P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of a weak soft X-ray source of V751 Cyg at minimum presents a challenge as this is unusual for CVs which commonly display weak hard X-ray emission at quiescence.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt;

The high luminosity (6.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s) is particularly hard to understand in the context of VY Scl stars generally, because observations suggest that the binaries become simple red dwarf + white dwarf pairs at quiescence (the disk mostly disappears).&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; "A high luminosity in soft X-rays poses an additional problem of understanding why the spectrum is of only modest excitation."&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; The ratio He II λ4686/Hβ did not exceed ~0.5 in any of the spectra recorded up to 2001, which is typical for accretion-powered CVs and does not approach the ratio of 2 commonly seen in supersoft binaries (CBSS).&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt;

Pushing the edge of acceptable X-ray fits toward lower luminosity suggests that the luminosity should not exceed ~2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; ergs/s, which gives only ~4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; ergs/s of reprocessed light in the WD about equal to the secondary's expected nuclear luminosity.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt;

==Magnetic cataclysmic variables==
{{main|Polar (cataclysmic variable)}}
X-rays from magnetic cataclysmic variables are common because accretion provides a continuous supply of coronal gas.&lt;ref name=Trimble/&gt; A plot of number of systems vs. orbit period shows a statistically significant minimum for periods between 2 and 3 hr which can probably be understood in terms of the effects of magnetic braking when the companion star becomes completely convective and the usual dynamo (which operates at the base of the convective envelope) can no longer give the companion a magnetic wind to carry off angular momentum.&lt;ref name=Trimble/&gt; The rotation has been blamed on asymmetric ejection of planetary nebulae and winds&lt;ref name=Spruit&gt;{{ cite journal |title=Origin of the rotation rates of single white dwarfs |author=Spruit HC |date=1998 |journal=Astron.

The three-axis acceleration switch was designed to obtain acceleration data more effectively than a conventional [[accelerometer]] in order to more accurately characterize the forces and shocks responsible for TBI.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While miniature accelerometers require a constant power draw, the three-axis acceleration switch only draws current when it senses an acceleration event, using up less energy and allowing the use of smaller batteries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The three-axis acceleration switch has shown to exhibit an expected battery lifetime that is about 100 times better than that of a digital accelerometer. In return, however, the acceleration switch has a lower resolution than that of a digital or analog accelerometer.

One potential application of the three-axis acceleration switch is in studying the head impacts of players in high-risk contact sports.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to the size of conventional accelerometers, measuring the acceleration requires the device to be implemented inside the player’s helmet, which is designed to mitigate the collision forces and thus may not accurately reflect the true level of injury potential. In contrast, the miniature nature of the acceleration switch makes it easier for the switch to be affixed directly onto the participant’s head.

{{Contains Vietnamese text}}
The '''Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation''' ({{lang-vi|Hội Bảo Tồn Di Sản Chữ Nôm}}; [[Hán Nôm]]: {{vi-nom|會保存遺産喃}}), shortened as the '''Nôm Foundation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation|work=[[Library of Congress]] Name Authority File|url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr2002015127.html|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abbreviated as '''VNPF''', is an American nonprofit agency for [[language preservation]] headquartered in [[Cary, North Carolina]], with an office in [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="vnpf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact|work=Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation|url=http://nomfoundation.org/Contact|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1999, it has been engaging in the preservation of [[Chữ Nôm]] script (an ancient, [[logographic]], [[Chinese character]]-based script once used by the [[Vietnamese people]] to write their language) remained in manuscripts, [[inscription]]s and [[woodcut|woodblock]]s.&lt;ref name="vnpf1"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the VNPF|work=Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation|url=http://nomfoundation.org/|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="upenn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Balaban|first=John|title=Update on Nom|work=Language Log, Linguistic Data Consortium, the [[University of Pennsylvania]]|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5212|date=July 16, 2013|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
The preservation of Chữ Nôm practiced by the Foundation involves different approaches, such as the electronic font carving, ideograms entered into [[Unicode]] and the International Standard (regulated by [[ISO]]), [[digitization]] for displaying Nôm on the [[Internet]] and the revival of ancient works in [[literature]], history, culture, [[music]]s and the [[arts]] (e.g. the [[chamber music]] called [[Ca trù]]).{{r|niu}} 

With the help of voluntary [[linguist]]s, [[lexicographer]]s and computer professionals from many part of the world, the VNPF publishes Nôm dictionary in both print edition and digital format, making it the first Nôm dictionary in [[TrueType]].{{r|vnpf1}}&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web|last=Balaban|first=John|title=The Hán-Nôm Special Collection Digitization Project|work=Southeast Asia Digital Library, [[Northern Illinois University]]|url=http://sea.lib.niu.edu/project/about_hannom|accessdate=August 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812213937/http://sea.lib.niu.edu/project/about_hannom|archive-date=August 12, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While granting scholarships to American and Vietnamese students who intend to research this subject,{{r|vnpf1}} the VNPF also sponsored two international Nôm conferences and represented Nôm script at the international meetings held by the [[Ideographic Rapporteur Group]].{{r|niu}}{{r|lse}}

==Projects==
There has been a scheme called ''the Digitization Project of the Hán-Nôm Special Collection'' cooperatively implemented by the Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation and the [[National Library of Vietnam]]. In 2006, a Memorandum was signed by the VNPF, enabling it to build a digital library based on the existing collections in the National Library which stores world's most ancient scripts written in Hán Nôm.{{r|niu}} Through the resources from the National Library, the VNPF had digitized more than 2000 Hán Nôm texts till 2013.{{r|upenn}}

Meanwhile, the VNPF has been directing another project to digitize the [[Thắng Nghiêm Temple]] ({{lang-vi|Chùa Thắng Nghiêm|links=no}}; Hán Nôm: {{vi-nom|寺勝嚴}}) near [[Hanoi]]. Constructed in the early 11th century under an imperial order, it is an important historical site for the Asian [[Buddhism]]. The project will be completed by 2014, bringing a web database of the full record from the Temple, including manuscripts, epigraphical materials and visual heritages in Chữ Nôm. Additionally, the building structure and [[iconographical]] ideas of the Thắng Nghiêm Temple will be shown in a photographic overview.&lt;ref name="ug"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmid|first=D.

Receiving funds from private donators, the Chino Cienega Foundation in [[California]], the International Music and Arts Foundation in [[Liechtenstein]], [[North Carolina State University]] and the [[U.S. Embassy in Hanoi]], this project is aimed at recording Vietnamese Buddhism, offering historical documents of the Temple, opening a path for further temple digitization in the future and letting the materials to be globally accessible.{{r|ug}}

==Staff==
Since 1999, Professor [[John Balaban]] at [[North Carolina State University]] has been the president of the VNPF. In 2000, he published his influential book ''Spring Essence: The Poetry of Ho Xuan Huong'' (written in both [[chữ quốc ngữ]] and Hán Nôm), which was the first Nôm book ever printed in the modern times.&lt;ref name="lse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preservation of the Vietnamese Nôm Script|work=Asia Research Centre, the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], the [[University of London]]|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/asiaResearchCentre/events/individual/2012/121116-Balaban.aspx|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ngô Thanh Nhàn, a Vietnamese characters researcher at [[Temple University]] and a [[computational linguist]] at [[New York University]], was the vice president from 1999 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact|work=the Center for Vietnamese Philosophy, Culture &amp; Society, College of Liberal Arts, [[Temple University]]|url=http://www.temple.edu/vietnamese_center/nomstudies/contacts.html|accessdate=August 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082509/http://www.temple.edu/vietnamese_center/nomstudies/contacts.html|archive-date=August 19, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ngô Thanh Nhàn|work=Computer Science Department, [[New York University]]|url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~nhan/home.html|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the VNPF has two vice presidents (Ngô Trung Viet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oronte|title=What Ngo Trung Viet Knows|work=[[Inside Higher Ed]]|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/the_education_of_oronte_churm/what_ngo_trung_viet_knows|date=July 20, 2007|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brad Crittenden&lt;ref name="vnpf2"&gt;{{cite web|title=The people|work=Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation|url=http://nomfoundation.org/About-the-Foundation/The-people|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and one secretary/treasurer (Stephen O.

Many scholars and policymakers have noted that the fields of [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) have remained predominantly male with historically low participation among [[Woman|women]] since their origins during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

Scholars are exploring the various reasons for the continued existence of this [[gender]] disparity in STEM fields. Those who view this disparity as resulting from [[discrimination|discriminatory]] forces are also seeking ways to redress this disparity within STEM fields (these typically construed as well-compensated, high-status professions with universal career appeal).&lt;ref&gt;Gürer, Denise and Camp, Tracy (2001).

Studies suggest that many factors contribute to the attitudes towards the achievement of young women in [[mathematics]] and [[science]], including encouragement from parents, interactions with mathematics and science teachers, curriculum content, hands-on laboratory experiences, high school achievement in mathematics and science, and resources available at home.&lt;ref name="Lost Talent"&gt;S.L. Hanson, "Lost Talent, Women in the Sciences", Philadelphia, PA.: Temple University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], research findings are mixed concerning when boys' and girls' attitudes about mathematics and science diverge. Analyzing several nationally representative [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]], one researcher found few differences in girls' and boys' attitudes towards science in the early secondary school years.&lt;ref name="Lost Talent"/&gt; Students' aspirations to pursue careers in mathematics and science influence both the courses they choose to take in those areas and the level of effort they put forth in these courses.

A 1996 study suggested girls begin to lose self-confidence in middle school because they believe that men possess more intelligence in technological fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pajares | first1 = F | year = 1996 | title = Self-efficacy beliefs and mathematical problem-solving of gifted students | url = | journal = [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]] | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 325–44 | doi=10.1006/ceps.1996.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that men outperform women in spatial analysis, a skillset many engineering professionals deem vital, generates this misconception.&lt;ref name="CeciWilliams2009" /&gt; Feminist scholars postulate that boys are more likely to gain spatial skills outside the classroom because they are culturally encouraged to build and work with their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Catherine, and Christianne Corbett.

A 1996 study of college freshmen by the [[Higher Education Research Institute]] shows that men and women differ greatly in their intended fields of study. Of first-time college freshmen in 1996, 20 percent of men and 4 percent of women planned to major in [[computer science]] and [[engineering]], while similar percentages of men and women planned to major in [[biology]] or [[Physical Sciences|physical sciences]]. The differences in the intended majors between male and female first-time freshmen directly relate to the differences in the fields in which men and women earn their degree. At the post-secondary level, women are less likely than men to earn a degree in mathematics, physical sciences, or computer sciences and engineering. The exception to this gender imbalance is in the field of [[Life-science|life science]].&lt;ref name="Freshman"&gt;Higher Education Research Institute, Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, The American Freshman: National Norms for Fall 1996, University of California, Los Angeles, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of underrepresentation of women in STEM careers ===
In [[Scotland]], a large number of women graduate in STEM subjects but fail to move onto a STEM career compared to men. The [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] estimates that doubling women's high-skill contributions to Scotland's economy would benefit it by £170&amp;nbsp;million per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Tapping All our Talents|date=April 2012|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/other/tapping-all-our-talents|location=United Kingdom|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=9780902198661|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Men's and women's earnings ===
{{See also|Gender pay gap}}
Female college graduates earned less on average than male college graduates, even though they shared the earnings growth of all college graduates in the 1980s. Some of the differences in salary are related to the differences in occupations entered by women and men. Among recent science and engineering bachelor's degree recipients, women were less likely than men to be employed in science and engineering occupations. There remains a wage gap between men and women in comparable scientific positions. Among more experienced scientists and engineers, the gender gap in salaries is greater than for recent graduates.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation, Women, Minorities and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 1996, Washington, D.C.: 1996, appendix table 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Salaries are highest in mathematics, computer science, and engineering, which are fields in which women are not highly represented. In [[Australia]], a study conducted by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] has shown that the current gender wage gap between men and women in STEM fields in Australia stands at 30.1 percent as of 2013, which is an increase of 3 percent since 2012.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.professionalsaustralia.org.au/professional-women/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2014/03/WOMEN_IN_STEM_v2.pdf|title=Women in STEM in Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Professionals Australia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to a study done by Moss, &lt;ref name="Moss-Racusin2012" /&gt;when faculty members of top research institutions in America were asked to recruit student applicants for a laboratory manager position, both men and women faculty members rated the male applicants as more hireable and competent for the position, as opposed to the female applicants who shared an identical resume with the male applicants. In the Moss study, faculty members were willing to give the male applicants a higher starting salary and career mentoring opportunities.&lt;ref name="Moss-Racusin2012" /&gt;

===Education and perception===
The percentage of PhDs in STEM fields in the U.S. earned by women is about 42%,&lt;ref name="NSF T7.3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/static/data/tab7-3.xlsx |title=TABLE 7-3.

== Representation of women worldwide ==
[[UNESCO]], among other agencies including the [[European Commission]] and The Association of Academies and Societies of Sciences in Asia (AASSA), have been outspoken about the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields globally.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002315/231519e.pdf|title=A Complex Formula: Girls and Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics in Asia|date=2015|website=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO Bangkok Office|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=She figures 2012 – Research policy and organisation – EU Bookshop|url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/uri?target=EUB:NOTICE:KINA25617:EN:HTML|doi=10.2777/38520|date=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interacademies.net/File.aspx?id=28016|title=Women in Science and Technology in Asia|date=1 September 2015|website=The InterAcademy Partnership|publisher=AASSA, Gyeonggi-Do|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their efforts to compile and interpret comparative statistics, it is necessary to exercise caution. [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] has commented on the obstacles regarding the making of meaningful statistical comparisons between countries:&lt;ref name="fastlane"&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Life in the fast lane: Arab women in science and technology," ''Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society'', vol. 36, no. 2 (2016), p. 107–117.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
For a variety of reasons, it is difficult to obtain reliable data on international comparisons of women in STEM fields.  Aggregate figures do not tell us much, especially since terminology describing educational levels, content of majors, job categories, and other markers varies from country to country. 
}}
Even when different countries use the same definitions of terms, the social significance of the categories may differ considerably. Koblitz remarks:&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Mathematics and gender: Some cross-cultural observations," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
It is not possible to use the same indicators to determine the situation in every country.  The significant statistic might be the percentage of women teaching at the university level.  But it might also be the proportion of women at research institutes and academies of sciences (and at what level), or the percentage of women who publish (or who publish in foreign as opposed to domestic journals), or the proportion of women who go abroad for conferences, post-graduate study, and so on, or the percentage of women awarded grants by national and international funding agencies.  Indices can have different meanings in different countries, and the prestige of various positions and honors can vary considerably.

=== Asia ===
[[File:Proportion of female graduates A Complex Formula.svg|thumb|Proportion of female graduates in science programmes in tertiary education in Asia.]]
A fact sheet published by UNESCO in March 2015&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; presented worldwide statistics of women in the STEM fields, with a focus on [[Asia]] and the Pacific region. It reports that, worldwide, 30 percent of researchers are women. In these areas, East Asia, the Pacific, South Asia and West Asia had the most uneven balance, with 20 percent of researchers being women in each of those sub-regions. Meanwhile, [[Central Asia]] had the most equal balance in the region, with women comprising 46 percent of its researchers. The Central Asian countries [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] were the only countries in Asia with women as the majority of their researchers, though in both cases it was by a very small margin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002351/235155E.pdf|title=Women in Science|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cambodia ====
As of 2004, 13.9% of students enrolled in science programs in [[Cambodia]] were female and 21% of researchers in science, technology, and innovation&amp;nbsp;fields were female as of 2002. These statistics are significantly lower than those of other Asian countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], and [[South Korea]]. According to a UNESCO report on women in STEM in Asian countries, Cambodia's education system has a long history of male dominance stemming from its male-only [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teaching practices. Starting in 1924, girls were allowed to enroll in school. Bias against women, not only in education but in other aspects of life as well, exists in the form of traditional views of men as more powerful and dignified than women, especially in the home and in the workplace, according to UNESCO's ''A Complex Formula''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Indonesia ====
UNESCO's ''A Complex Formula'' states that [[Indonesia]]'s government has been working towards gender equality, especially through the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]], but stereotypes about women's roles in the workplace persists. Due to traditional views and societal [[Norm (social)|norms]], women struggle to remain in their careers or to move up in the workplace. Substantially more women are enrolled in science-based fields such as [[pharmacy]] and biology than in mathematics and [[physics]]. Within engineering, statistics vary based on the specific engineering discipline; women make up 78% of [[chemical engineering]] students but only 5% of [[mechanical engineering]] students. As of 2005, out of 35,564 researchers in science, technology, and engineering, only 10,874 or 31% were female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Malaysia ====
According to UNESCO, 48.19% of students enrolled in science programs in Malaysia were female as of 2011. This number has grown significantly in the past three decades, during which the country's employment of women has increased by 95%. In Malaysia, over 50% of employees in the computer industry, which is generally a male-dominated field within STEM, are women. Of students enrolled in pharmacy, more than 70% are female, while in engineering only 36% of students are female. Women held 49% of research positions in science, technology, and innovation as of 2011.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Mongolia ====
According to UNESCO's data from 2012 and 2011 respectively, 40.2% of students enrolled in science programs and 49% of researchers in science, technology, and innovation in Mongolia are female.&amp;nbsp;Traditionally, [[nomad]]ic Mongol culture was fairly egalitarian, with both women and men raising children, tending livestock, and fighting in battle, which mirrors the relative equality of women and men in Mongolia's modern-day workforce. More females than males pursue higher education and 65% of college graduates in Mongolia are women. However, women earn about 19–30% less than their male counterparts and are perceived by society to be less suited to engineering than men. Thirty percent or less of employees in computer science, construction architecture, and engineering are female while three in four biology students are female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Nepal ====
As of 2011, 26.17% of [[Nepal]]'s science students were women and 19% of their engineering students were also women. In research, women held 7.8% of positions in 2010. These low percentages correspond with Nepal's patriarchal societal values. In Nepal, women that enter STEM fields most often enter forestry or medicine, specifically [[nursing]], which is perceived as a predominantly female occupation in most countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== South Korea ====
In 2012, 30.63% of students enrolled in science programs in South Korea were female, a number that has been increasing since the digital revolution. Numbers of male and female students enrolled at most levels of education are comparable as well, though the gender difference is larger in higher education. Confucian beliefs in the lower societal value of women as well as other cultural factors could influence South Korea's STEM gender gap. In South Korea, as in other countries, the percentage of women in medicine (61.6%) is much higher than the percentage of women in engineering (15.4%) and other more math-based stem fields. In research occupations in science, technology, and innovation, women made up 17% of the workforce as of 2011. In South Korea, most women working in STEM fields are classified as "non-regular" or temporary employees, indicating poor job stability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In a study conducted by the University of Glasgow which examined math anxiety and test performance of boys and girls from various countries, researchers found that South Korea had a high sex difference in mathematics scores, with female students scoring significantly lower than and experiencing more math anxiety on math tests than male students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoet|first=Gijsbert|last2=Bailey|first2=Drew H.|last3=Moore|first3=Alex M.|last4=Geary|first4=David C.|date=2016-04-21|title=Countries with Higher Levels of Gender Equality Show Larger National Sex Differences in Mathematics Anxiety and Relatively Lower Parental Mathematics Valuation for Girls|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0153857|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0153857|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4839696|pmid=27100631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gulf states ====
[[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] reported&lt;ref name="fastlane"/&gt; on a series of interviews conducted in 2015 in Abu Dhabi with women engineers and computer scientists who had come to the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf states to find opportunities that were not available to them in their home country.  The women spoke of a remarkably high level of job satisfaction and relatively little discrimination.  Koblitz comments that

{{Quote|
...most people in most countries outside of the Middle East have no idea that the region, in particular the UAE, is a magnet for young, dynamic Arab women making successful careers for themselves in a variety of high-tech and other scientific fields; "land of opportunity," "a tech-person's paradise," and yes, even "mecca" were among the terms used to describe the UAE by the women I met.

In the [[European Union]] only 16.7% on average of ICT (Information and communication technology) specialists are women. Only in [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] do women hold more that 25 percent of these roles. The gender distribution is more balanced, particularly in [[History of the European Union|new member states]] when taking into account ICT technicians (middle and low-ranking positions).&lt;ref name=EDJNet /&gt;

In 2012 the percentage of women PhD graduates was 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, and just the 28% of PhD graduates in engineering, manufacturing and construction. In the computing subfield only 21% of PhD graduates were women. In 2013 in the EU as an average men scientists and engineers made up 4.1% of total labour force, while women made up only 2.8%. In more than half of the countries women make up less than 45% of scientists and engineers. The situation has improved, as between 2008 and 2011 the number of women amongst employed scientists and engineers grew by an average of 11.1% per year, while the number of men grew only by 3.3% over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 28 August 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 in [[Slovenia]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and [[Italy]] there were more boys than girls taking advanced courses in mathematics and physics in secondary education in Grade 12.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;

In 2018 [[European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society]] [[Mariya Gabriel]] announced plans to increase the participation of women in the digital sector by challenging stereotypes; promoting digital skills and education and advocating for more women entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More women in the Digital sector: a key to Europe's successful digital future |url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/more-women-digital-sector-key-europes-successful-digital-future-international-womens-day-2018 |work=Digital Single Market|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 August 2018 |date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men are much more likely than women to have a STEM career regardless of educational attainment. Women in STEM fields earn considerably less than men, even after controlling for a wide set of characteristics such as education and age. On average, men in STEM jobs earn $36.34 per hour while women in STEM jobs earn $31.11 per hour.&lt;ref name="Women in STEM"/&gt;

Women dominate the total number of persons with bachelor's degrees, as well as those in STEM fields defined by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]]. However, they are underrepresented in specific fields including Computer Sciences, Engineering, and Mathematics.

Asian women are over-represented in STEM fields in the U.S.(though not as much as males of the same ethnicity) compared to African American, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and Native American women.&lt;ref name="NCES2014"/&gt; Within academia, these minority women represent less than 1% of tenure-track positions in the top 100 U.S. universities despite constituting approximately 13% of total US population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Towns|first=Marcy|date=Spring 2010|title=Where Are the Women of Color?

==== African American Women ====
Prejudice and assumed stereotypes keep women of color, especially black women from studying in STEM fields. Psychologically, stereotypes on black women's intellect, cognitive abilities, and work ethic contribute to their lack of confidence in STEM. Spelman College is looking to change how the world looks at African American women, and welcomes black women helping to support them in becoming involved and technically proficient in STEM. Spelman provides the environment which cultivates creativity, intellectual thinking, and curiosity to broaden their thinking for complex solutions. 2,100 students of Spelman come from forty-four states, one territory and eleven countries, with one of the highest ranks of all institutions with black graduating with bachelors of science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Kimberly M.|date=Spring 2014|title=Realigning the crooked room: Spelman claims a space for African American women in STEM|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A379445373/ITOF?u=auraria_main&amp;sid=ITOF&amp;xid=1a7ce7cd|journal=Realigning the Crooked Room: Spelman Claims a Space for African American Women in STEM|volume=16|pages=|via=Auraria Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
According to the National Household Survey, women represented 39% of STEM graduates in Canada, as opposed to 66% in non-STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11874-eng.htm|title=Gender differences in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer science (STEM) programs at university|last=Hango|first=Darcy|date=2015|website=statcan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the [[University of British Columbia]] discovered that only 20–25% of computer science students from all Canadian college and universities are women. As well, only about 1 in 5 of that percentage will graduate from those programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A325699497/GPS?u=ko_k12hs_d73&amp;sid=GPS&amp;xid=ce00382c|title=Unlocking the brilliance: author provides insights on how to inspire young women to join the high tech industry|website=link.galegroup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistically, women are less likely to choose a STEM program, regardless of mathematical ability. Young men with lower marks in mathematics are more likely to pursue STEM fields than their women-identified peers with higher marks in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Darcy Hango|title=Gender differences in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer science (STEM) programs at university|date=18 Dec 2013|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11874-eng.htm|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underrepresentation in STEM-related awards and competitions ==
In terms of the most prestigious awards in STEM fields, fewer have been awarded to women than to men. Between 1901 and 2017 the female:total ratio of [[Nobel Prize]]s were 2:207 for physics, 4:178 for chemistry, 12:214 for physiology/medicine, and 1:79 for economic sciences.
The ratios for other fields were 14:114 in literature and 16:104 for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/ |title=Nobel Prize Facts |publisher= NobelPrize.org |access-date=18 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryam Mirzakhani]] was the first woman and first Iranian to receive the [[Fields Medal]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Prizes/2014/news_release_mirzakhani.pdf|title=The Work of Maryam Mirzakhani.

Fewer female students participate in prestigious STEM-related competitions such as the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. In 2017, only 10% of the IMO participants were female and there was one female on the South Korean winning team of six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imo-official.org/organizers.aspx?column=year&amp;amp;order=desc | title=International Mathematical Olympiad Timeline | website=International Mathematical Olympiad |publisher= |access-date=18 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koreadailyus.com/korea-takes-1st-place-at-international-math-olympiad/ | title=Korea Takes 1st Place at International Math Olympiad | date=25 Jul 2017 |website=Korea Daily |publisher= |access-date=18 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of UK patent applications, in 2016, found that the proportion of new inventions registered by women was rising, but that most female inventors were active in stereotypically female fields such as "designing bras and make-up". 94% of inventions in the field of computing, 96% in automotive applications and mining, and 99% in explosives and munitions, were by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=New generation of inventors wanted: women need to apply|last=Keate|first=Georgie|date=27 December 2016|work=[[The Times]]|pages=22–23|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 [[Russia]] had the highest percentage of patents filed by women, at about 16%.

== Explanations for low representation of women ==
There are a variety of proposed reasons for the relatively low numbers of women in STEM fields. These can be broadly classified into societal, psychological, and innate explanations. However, explanations are not necessarily restricted to just one of these categories.

Schiebinger claims discrimination, both overt and covert, faced by women in STEM fields leads to fewer women in STEM fields.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999" /&gt;{{rp|33}} In the 1980s, researchers demonstrated a general evaluative bias against women.&lt;ref name=Swim1989&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swim|first1=J.|last2=Borgida|first2=E.|last3=Maruyama|first3=G.|last4=Myers|first4=D.G.|title=Joan McKay versus John McKay: Do gender stereotypes bias evaluations?|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1989|volume=105|issue=3|pages=409–429|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.3.409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 study, email requests were sent to meet to professors in doctoral programs at the top 260 U.S. universities. It was impossible to determine whether any particular individual in this study was exhibiting discrimination, since each participant only viewed a request from one potential graduate student. However, researchers found evidence for discrimination against ethnic minorities and women relative to Caucasian men.&lt;ref name=Milkman2012&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Milkman| first1=K.L|last2=Akinola| first2=M.|last3=Chugh|first3=D.| title=Temporal Distance and Discrimination: An Audit Study in Academia|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012| volume=23|issue=7|pages=710–717|doi=10.1177/0956797611434539|pmid=22614463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, science faculty were sent the materials of student who was applying for a lab manager position at their university.&lt;ref name=Moss-Racusin2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moss-Racusin|first1=C.A.|last2=Dovidio| first2=J.F.|last3=Brescoll| first3=V.L.|last4=Graham| first4=M.| last5=Handelsman|first5=J.| title=Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2012 |volume=109|issue=41|pages=16474–16479| doi=10.1073/pnas.1211286109|pmid=22988126| pmc=3478626}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials were the same for each participant, but each application was randomly assigned either a male or a female name. The researchers found that faculty members rated the male candidates as both more competent and more hirable than the females candidate, despite applications being otherwise identical.&lt;ref name=Moss-Racusin2012/&gt; If individuals are given information about a prospective student's gender, they may infer that he or she possesses traits consistent with stereotypes for that gender.&lt;ref name=Deaux1984&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deaux|first1=K.|last2=Lewis|first2=L.L.|title=Structure of gender stereotypes: Interrelationships among components and gender label|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1984|volume=46|issue=5|pages=991–1004|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.5.991}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2014 found that men are favored in some domains, such as tenure rates in biology, but that the majority of domains were gender-fair. The authors interpreted this to suggest that the underrepresentation of women in the professorial ranks was not solely caused by sexist hiring, promotion, and remuneration.&lt;ref name="Ceci-2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ceci |first1=S.

==== Stereotypes ====
Stereotypes about what someone in a STEM field should look and act like may cause established members of these fields to overlook individuals who are highly competent.&lt;ref name=Wells1985&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Gary L.|title=The Conjunction Error and the Representativeness Heuristic|journal=Social Cognition| year=1985|volume=3|issue=3| pages=266–279|doi=10.1521/soco.1985.3.3.266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypical scientist or individual in another STEM profession is usually thought to be male.&lt;ref name=Good2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Good|first1=Jessica J.|last2=Woodzicka|first2=Julie A.|last3= Wingfield|first3= Lylan C.|title=The Effects of Gender Stereotypic and Counter-Stereotypic Textbook Images on Science Performance|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=150|issue=2|pages=132–147|doi=10.1080/00224540903366552|pmid=20397590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in STEM fields may not fit individuals' conception of what a scientist, engineer, or mathematician "should" look like and may thus be overlooked or penalized. The Role Congruity Theory of Prejudice states that perceived incongruity between gender and a particular role or occupation can result in negative evaluations.&lt;ref name=Eagly2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagly|first1=A.H.|last2=Karau|first2=S.J.|title=Role congruity theory of prejudice toward female leaders|journal=Psychological Review|year=2002| volume=109|issue=3| pages=573–598| doi=10.1037/0033-295x.109.3.573| pmid=12088246|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garcia-Retamero2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia-Retamero|first1=R.|last2=Lopez-Zafra|first2=E.|title=Prejudice against Women in Male-congenial Environments: Perceptions of Gender Role Congruity in Leadership|journal=Sex Roles|year=2006|volume=55|issue=1–2|pages=51–61|doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9068-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ritter2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ritter|first1=B.A.|last2=Yoder|first2=J.D.|title=Gender Differences in Leader Emergence Persist Even for Dominant Women: An Updated Confirmation of Role Congruity Theory|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|year=2004|volume=28|issue=3|pages=187–193|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00135.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, negative stereotypes about women's quantitative abilities may lead people to devalue their work or discourage these women from continuing in STEM fields.&lt;ref name=Miyake2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miyake|first1=A.|last2=Kost-Smith|first2=L.E.|last3=Finkelstein|first3=N.D.|last4 = Pollock|first4=S.J.|last5=Cohen|first5=G.L.|last6=Ito|first6=T.A.|title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation|journal=Science| year=2010|volume=330|issue=6008| pages=1234–1237| doi=10.1126/science.1195996 | pmid=21109670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men and women who work in "nontraditional" occupations may encounter discrimination, but the forms and consequences of this discrimination are different. Individuals of a particular gender are often perceived to be better suited to particular careers or areas of study than those of the other gender.&lt;ref name=Gaucher2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Gaucher|first1=D.| last2=Friesen|first2=J.|last3=Kay| first3=A.C.|title=Evidence that gendered wording in job advertisements exists and sustains gender inequality|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=101| issue=1|pages=109–128| doi=10.1037/a0022530|pmid=21381851}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyness2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyness|first1=K.S.|last2=Heilman|first2=M.E.|title=When fit is fundamental: Performance evaluations and promotions of upper-level female and male managers|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology| year=2006|volume=91| issue=4| pages=777–785| doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.4.777|pmid=16834505|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.9525}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that job advertisements for male-dominated careers tended to use more agentic words (or words denoting agency, such as "leader" and "goal-oriented") associated with male stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Gaucher2011/&gt; Social Role Theory, proposed in 1991, states that men are expected to display agentic qualities and women to display communal qualities.&lt;ref name=Eagly1991&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagly|first1=A.H.|last2=Wood|first2=W.|title=Explaining Sex Differences in Social Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Perspective|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1991|volume=17|issue=3|pages=306–315| doi=10.1177/0146167291173011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expectations can influence hiring decisions.&lt;ref name=Madera2009&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Madera|first1=J.M.|last2=Hebl|first2=M.R.|last3=Martin|first3=R.C.| title=Gender and letters of recommendation for academia: Agentic and communal differences|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=2009|volume=94|issue=6|pages=1591–1599|doi=10.1037/a0016539|pmid=19916666|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.9717}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study found that women tended to be described in more communal terms and men in more agentic terms in letters of recommendation. These researchers also found that communal characteristics were negatively related to hiring decisions in academia.&lt;ref name=Madera2009/&gt;

Although women entering traditionally male professions face negative stereotypes suggesting that they are not "real" women, these stereotypes do not seem to deter women to the same degree that similar stereotypes may deter men from pursuing nontraditional professions. There is historical evidence that women flock to male-identified occupations once opportunities are available.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, Samuel. 1985. ''The Process of Occupational Sex-Typing''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, examples of occupations changing from predominantly female to predominantly male are very rare in human history. The few existing cases—such as medicine—suggest that redefinition of the occupations as appropriately masculine is necessary before men will consider joining them.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenreich, Barbara, and Deirdre English. 1978. For Her Own Good: 100 Years of Expert Advice to Women. Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although men in female-dominated occupations may contend with negative stereotypes about their masculinity, they may also experience certain benefits. In 1992 it was suggested that women in male-dominated occupations tended to hit a [[glass ceiling]]; while men in female-dominated occupations may hit a "glass escalator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Christine | year = 1992 | title = The Glass Escalator: Hidden Advantages for Men in the 'Female' Professions | journal = Social Problems | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 253–267 | jstor=3096961 | doi=10.1525/sp.1992.39.3.03x0034h}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the glass ceiling can make it difficult for women and minorities to reach the top of an occupation, the "glass escalator" allows men to excel in a profession that is female dominated.

====Black Sheep effect====
{{Main|Black sheep effect}}

The Black Sheep effect occurs when individuals are likely to evaluate members of their in-group more favorably than members of their out-group when those members are highly qualified.&lt;ref name=Eidelman2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eidelman|first1=S.|last2=Biernat|first2=M.|title=Derogating black sheep: Individual or group protection?|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology| year=2003|volume=39| issue=6|pages=602–609| doi=10.1016/s0022-1031(03)00042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerr1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=N.L.|last2=Hymes|first2=R.W.|last3=Anderson|first3=A.B.|last4=Weathers|first4=J.E.|title=Defendant-juror similarity and mock juror judgments|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=1995|volume=19|issue=6|pages=545–567|doi=10.1007/bf01499374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marques2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=J.|last2=Abrams|first2=D.|last3=Serodio|first3=R.G.|title=Being better by being right: Subjective group dynamics and derogation of in-group deviants when generic norms are undermined|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=81|issue=3|pages=436–447|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.3.436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=T.S.|last2=Hosch|first2=H.M.|title=An examination of jury verdicts for evidence of a similarity-leniency effect, an out-group punitiveness effect or a black sheep effect|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=2004|volume=28|issue=5|pages=587–598|doi=10.1023/b:lahu.0000046436.36228.71}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when an individual's in-group members have average or below average qualities, he or she is likely to evaluate them much lower than out-group members with equivalent qualifications.&lt;ref name=Eidelman2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerr1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marques2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2004/&gt; This suggests that established women in STEM fields will be more likely than established men to help early career women who display sufficient qualifications. However, established women will be less likely than men to help early career women who display insufficient qualifications.

====Queen Bee effect====
The Queen Bee effect is similar to the Black Sheep effect but applies only to women. It explains why higher-status women, particularly in male-dominated professions, may actually be far less likely to help other women than their male colleagues might be.&lt;ref name=Cooper1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=V.W.|title=Homophily or the Queen Bee Syndrome|journal=Small Group Research|year=1997|volume=28|issue=4|pages=483–499|doi=10.1177/1046496497284001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellemers|first1=N.|last2=Van den Heuvel|first2=H.|last3=de Gilder|first3=D.|last4=Maass|first4=A.|last5=Bonvini|first5=A.|title=The underrepresentation of women in science: Differential commitment or the queen bee syndrome?|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=43|issue=3|pages=315–338|doi=10.1348/0144666042037999|pmid=15479533|url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/files/1953519/Ellemers%20British%20Journal%20of%20Social%20Psychology%2043%202004%20u.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study found that while doctoral students in a number of different disciplines did not exhibit any gender differences in work commitment or work satisfaction, faculty members at the same university believed that female students were less committed to their work than male students.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; What was particularly surprising was that these beliefs by faculty members were most strongly endorsed by female faculty members, rather than male faculty members.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; One potential explanation for this finding is that individual mobility for a member of a negatively stereotyped group is often accompanied by a social and psychological distancing of oneself from the group. This implies that successful women in traditionally male-dominated careers do not see their success as evidence that negative stereotypes about women's quantitative and analytical abilities are wrong, but rather as proof that they personally are exceptions to the rule.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; Thus, such women may actually play a role in perpetuating, rather than abolishing, these negative stereotypes.

====Mentorship====
In STEM fields, the support and encouragement of a mentor can make a lot of difference in women's decisions of whether or not to continue pursuing a career in their discipline&lt;ref name=Sonnert2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sonnert|first1=G.|last2=Fox|first2=M.F.|last3=Adkins|first3=K.|title=Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Effects of Faculty, Fields, and Institutions Over Time|journal=Social Science Quarterly|year=2007|volume=88|issue=5|pages=1333–1356|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2007.00505.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.452.4529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stout2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Stout|first1=J.G.|last2=Dasgupta| first2=N.|last3=Hunsinger| first3=M.|last4=McManus| first4=M.A.|title=STEMing the tide: Using ingroup experts to inoculate women's self-concept in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=2|pages=255–270|doi=10.1037/a0021385|pmid=21142376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be particularly true for younger individuals who may face many obstacles early on in their careers.&lt;ref name="Griffith2010"/&gt; Since these younger individuals often look to those who are more established in their discipline for help and guidance, the responsiveness and helpfulness of potential mentors is incredibly important.

====Lack of support====
Women in STEM may leave due to not being invited to professional meetings, the use of sexually discriminating standards against women, inflexible working conditions, the perceived need to hide pregnancies, and the struggle to balance family and work. Women in STEM fields that have children either need child care or to take a long leave of absence. When a [[nuclear family]] can not afford child care, typically it is the mother that gives up her career to stay at home with the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/7-things-keeping-women-out-of-science-2013-10 |title=These Are The 7 Things Keeping Women Out of Science Careers |last=Welsh |first=Jennifier |date=16 Oct 2013 |website= |publisher=Business Insider |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due in part to women being paid statistically less in their careers. The man makes more money so the man goes to work and the woman gives up her career. Maternity leave is another issue women in STEM fields face. In the [[Maternity leave in the United States|U.S. maternity leave]] is required by The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/ |title=Family and Medical Leave Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=United States Department of Labor |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FMLA requires 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually for mothers of newborn or newly adopted children. This is one of the lowest levels of leave in the industrialized world. Unlike the United States, most countries have the right to paid time off.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} If a new mother does not have external financial support or savings, they may not be able to take their full maternity leave. Few companies allow men to take paternity leave and it may be shorter than women's maternity leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edd.ca.gov/Disability/PFL_Fathers.htm |title=Paid Family Leave – Fathers |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=State of California, Employment Development Department |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer paternity leaves for men could allow women to go back to work while their partners stay home with the children.

==== Harassment ====
In 1993 ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' indicated that three-quarters of women students and residents were harassed at least once during their medical training.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

==== Lack of role models ====
In engineering and science education, women made up almost 50 percent of non-tenure track lecturer and instructor jobs, but only 10 percent of tenured or tenure-track professors in 1996. In addition, the number of female department chairs in medical schools did not change from 1976 to 1996.&lt;ref name="Pell1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pell|first1=A N|title=Fixing the leaky pipeline: women scientists in academia|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=74|issue=11| year=1996|pages=2843–8|issn=0021-8812| doi=10.2527/1996.74112843x|pmid=8923199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women who do make it to tenured or tenure-track positions may face the difficulties associated with holding a token status. They may lack support from colleagues and may face antagonism from peers and supervisors.&lt;ref name="Lips2008" /&gt; However, in 2014 a team of psychologists and economists conducted extensive analyses of national data and concluded that the state of women in STEM has changed greatly in the past two decades and any conclusions about their status based on data prior to 2000 are likely to be outdated. In general, they concluded that women had very sizable gains in academic science, including remuneration, promotion, and job satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Ceci2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ceci|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Ginther|first2=Donna K.|last3=Kahn|first3=Shulamit|last4=Williams|first4=Wendy M.|title=Women in Academic Science, A Changing Landscape |journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest |volume=15 |issue=3 |year=2014 |pages=75–141 |issn=1529-1006 |doi=10.1177/1529100614541236|pmid=26172066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it has been posited that more female role models would encourage more women to enter fields dominated by men, research has indicated this is not the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Cheryan|first1 = Sapna|last2 = Siy|first2 = John Oliver|last3 = Vichayapai|first3 = Marissa|last4 = Drury|first4 = Benjamin J.|last5 = Kim|first5 = Saenam|title = Do Female and Male Role Models Who Embody STEM Stereotypes Hinder Women's Anticipated Success in STEM?|journal = Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume = 2|issue = 6|pages = 656–664|doi = 10.1177/1948550611405218|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that women's lack of interest in STEM fields may instead in part stem from stereotypes about employees and workplaces in STEM fields, to which stereotypes women are disproportionately responsive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/15/geeky_decor_puts_off_ladies/ |title=Ladies put off tech careers by sci-fi posters, Coke cans |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/06/27/girls_into_tech_cracked_at_last_sorta/ |title=Trick-cyclist's claim: I have FOUND how to get GIRLS INTO TECH |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=27 June 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Clustering and leaky pipeline ====
In the early 1980s Rossiter put forth the concept of "territorial segregation" or [[occupational segregation]], which is the idea that women "cluster" in certain fields of study.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} For example, "women are more likely to teach and do research in the humanities and social sciences than in the natural sciences and engineering",&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"/&gt;{{rp|34}} and the majority of college women tend to choose majors such as psychology, education, English, performing arts, and nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ruchika Tulshyan |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/03/02/top-10-college-majors-women-forbes-woman-leadership-education_slide_11.html |title=Top 10 College Majors For Women – 10: Liberal Arts and Sciences, General Studies, Humanities |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123090031/http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/02/top-10-college-majors-women-forbes-woman-leadership-education_slide_11.html|archivedate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossiter also used "hierarchical segregation" as an explanation for the low number of women in STEM fields.{{clarify|date=March 2018}} She describes "hierarchical segregation" as a decrease in the number of women as one "moves up the ladder of power and prestige."&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"/&gt;{{rp|33}} This is related to the [[STEM pipeline|leaky STEM pipeline]] concept. The metaphor of the leaky pipeline has been used to describe how women drop out of STEM fields at all stages of their careers. In the U.S., out of 2,000 high school aged persons, 1944 were enrolled in high school fall 2014.&lt;ref name="NCES d15_201.20"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_201.20.asp |title=Table 201.20.

=== Psychological ===
==== Lack of interest ====
A meta-analysis concluded that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people. When interests were classified by [[Holland Codes|RIASEC type]] (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional), men showed stronger Realistic and Investigative interests, and women showed stronger Artistic, Social, and Conventional interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering, science, and mathematics interests.&lt;ref name="Su2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=Rong|last2=Rounds|first2=James|last3= Armstrong|first3= Patrick|title=Men and Things, Women and People: A Meta-Analysis of Sex Differences in Interests|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2009|volume=135|issue=6|pages=859–884|doi=10.1037/a0017364|pmid=19883140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 3-year interview study, Seymour and Hewitt (1997) found that perceptions that non-STEM academic majors offered better education options and better matched their interests was the most common (46%) reason provided by female students for switching majors from STEM areas to non-STEM areas. The second most frequently cited reason given for switching to non-STEM areas was a reported loss of interest in the women's chosen STEM majors. Additionally, 38% of female students who remained in STEM majors expressed concerns that there were other academic areas that might be a better fit for their interests.&lt;ref name="Seymour1997"&gt;{{cite book | last=Seymour | first=Elaine | title=Talking about leaving : why undergraduates leave the sciences | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, CO, USA | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-8133-6642-5 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preston's (2004) survey of 1,688 individuals who had left sciences also showed that 30 percent of the women endorsed "other fields more interesting" as their reason for leaving.&lt;ref name="Preston2004"&gt;{{cite book | last=Preston | first=Anne | title=Leaving science : occupational exit from scientific careers | publisher=Russell Sage Foundation | location=New York | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-87154-694-4 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced math skills do not often result in a woman being interested in a STEM career. A [[Statistics Canada]] survey found that even young women of high mathematical ability are much less likely to enter a STEM field than young men of similar or even lesser ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Lack of confidence ====
Research has found that women steer away from STEM fields because they believe they are not qualified for them; the study suggested that this could be fixed by encouraging girls to participate in more mathematics classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/27/new_study_into_lack_of_women_in_tech_its_not_the_mens_fault/?mt=1437990843635 |title=New study into lack of women in Tech: It's NOT the men's fault |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the factors behind girls' lack of confidence might be unqualified or ineffective teachers.

Out of STEM-intending students, 35% of women stated that their reason for leaving calculus was due to lack of understanding the material, while only 14% of men stated the same.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt; The study reports that this difference in reason for leaving calculus is thought to develop from women's low level of confidence in their ability, and not actual skill. This study continues to establish that women and men have different levels of confidence in their ability and that confidence is related to how individual's performance in STEM fields.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt; It was seen in another study that when men and women of equal math ability were asked to rate their own ability, women will rate their own ability at a much lower level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chipman|first=Susan|date=September 1992|title=Mathematics Anxiety and Science Careers Among Able College Women|url=|journal=Psychological Science |volume=3 |issue=5|pages=292–295|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs with the purpose to reduce anxiety in math or increase confidence have a positive impact on women continuing their pursuit of a career in the STEM field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Stephanie|date=October 2013|title=For Girls in STEM, Belonging, Not Brain Structure, Makes the Difference|url=|journal=Techniques: Connecting Education &amp; Careers|volume=88 |issue=7|pages=34–36|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only can the issue of confidence keep women from even entering STEM fields, but even women in upper-level courses with higher skill are more strongly affected by the stereotype that they (by nature) do not possess innate ability to succeed.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Julia|date=November–December 2012|title=Calculus GPA and Math Identification as Moderators of Stereotype Threat in Highly Persistent Women|url=|journal=Basic &amp; Applied Social Psychology|volume=34 |issue=6|pages=534–543|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can cause a negative effect on confidence for women despite making it through courses designed to filter students out of the field.

====Stereotype threat====
Stereotype threat arises from the fear that one's actions will confirm a negative stereotype about one's in-group. This fear creates additional stress, consuming valuable cognitive resources and lowering task performance in the threatened domain.&lt;ref name=Schmader2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmader|first1=T.|last2=Johns|first2=M.|title=Converging evidence that stereotype threat reduces working memory capacity|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=85|issue=3|pages=440–452|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.3.440|pmid=14498781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steele1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=C.M.|last2=Aronson|first2=J.|title=Stereotype Threat and the Intellectual Test Performance of African Americans|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=69|issue=5|pages=797–811|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797|pmid=7473032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steele2002&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Steele|first1=C.M.|last2=Spencer|first2=S.J.|last3=Aronson|first3=J.|title=Contending with group image: The psychology of stereotype and social identity threat|year=2002|volume=34|pages=379–440|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(02)80009-0|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=9780120152346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are susceptible to stereotype threat whenever they are assessed in a domain for which there is a perceived negative stereotype about a group to which they belong. Stereotype threat undermines the academic performance of women and girls in math and science, which leads to an underestimation of abilities in these subjects by standard measures of academic achievement.&lt;ref name=Spencer1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer|first1=S.J.|last2=Steele|first2=C.M.|last3=Quinn|first3=D.M.|title=Stereotype threat and women's math performance|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=1999|volume=35|issue=1|pages=4–28|doi=10.1006/jesp.1998.1373|citeseerx=10.1.1.370.3979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miyake2010/&gt; Individuals who identify strongly with a certain area (e.g., math) are more likely to have their performance in that area hampered by stereotype threat than those who identify less strongly with the area.&lt;ref name=Steele2002/&gt; This means that even highly motivated students from negatively stereotyped groups are likely to be adversely affected by stereotype threat and thus may come to disengage from the stereotyped domain.&lt;ref name=Steele2002/&gt;
Negative stereotypes about girls’ capabilities in mathematics and science drastically lower their performance in mathematics and science courses as well as their interest in pursuing a STEM career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christine-bork/women-in-science_b_1327752.html |title=STEM Fields: Where Are the Women? |last=Bork |first=Christine |date= 2012-03-08|website= |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that gender differences in performance disappear if students are told that there are no gender differences on a particular mathematics test.&lt;ref name=Spencer1999/&gt; This indicates that the learning environment can greatly impact success in a course.

Stereotype threat has been criticized on a theoretical basis.&lt;ref name=jensen&gt;Arthur Robert Jensen "The g factor: the science of mental ability" 1998 {{ISBN|0-275-96103-6}}, Praeger Publishers, 88 Post Road West, Westport, CT 06881, pages 513–515: "the phenomenon of stereotype threat can be explained in terms of a more general construct, test anxiety, which has been studied since the early days of psychometrics. Test anxiety tends to lower performance levels on tests in proportion to the degree of complexity and the amount of mental effort they require of the subject. The relatively greater effect of test anxiety in the black
samples, who had somewhat lower SAT scores, than the white subjects in the Stanford experiments constitutes an example of the Yerkes-Dodson law ... by conducting the same type of experiment using exclusively white (or black)
subjects, divided into lower- and higher-ability groups, it might be shown that 
the phenomenon attributed to stereotype threat has nothing to do with race as
such, but results from the interaction of ability level with test anxiety as a
function of test complexity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoet2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = G. | last2 = Geary | first2 = D.

A study&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; was done to determine how stereotype threat and math identification can affect women who were majoring in a STEM related field. There were three different situations, designed to test the impact of stereotype on performance in math. One group of women were informed that men had previously out-performed women on the same calculus test they were about to take. The next group was told men and women had performed at the same level. The last group was told nothing about how men had performed and there was no mention of gender before taking their test. Out of these situations, women performed at their best scores when there was no mention of gender. The worst scores were from the situation where women were told that men had performed better than women. For women to pursue the male-dominated field of STEM, previous research shows that they must have more confidence in math/science ability.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt;

===Innate versus learned skill===

Some studies propose the explanation that STEM fields (and especially fields like physics, math and philosophy) are considered by both teachers and students to require more innate talent than skills that can be learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/beliefs-about-innate-talent-may-dissuade-students-from-stem-42967 |title=Beliefs about innate talent may dissuade students from STEM |last=Miller |first=David |date=9 Jun 2015 |website= |publisher=The Conversation |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a tendency to view women as having less of the required innate abilities, researchers propose this can result in assessing women as less qualified for STEM positions. In a study done by Ellis, Fosdick and Rasmussen, it was concluded that without strong skills in calculus, women cannot perform as well as their male counterparts in any field of STEM, which leads to the fewer women pursuing a career in these fields.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=Jessica|last2=Fosdick|first2=Bailey K.|last3=Rasmussen|first3=Chris|title=Women 1.5 Times More Likely to Leave STEM Pipeline after Calculus Compared to Men: Lack of Mathematical Confidence a Potential Culprit|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=7|year=2016|pages=1–14|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0157447|pmid=27410262|pmc=4943602}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high percentage of women that do pursue a career in STEM do not continue on this pathway after taking Calculus I, which was found to be a class that weeds out students from the STEM pathway.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt;

There have been several controversial statements about innate ability and success in STEM. A few notable examples include [[Lawrence Summers]], former president of [[Harvard University]] who suggested cognitive ability at high end positions could cause a population difference. Summers later stepped down as president.&lt;ref name="harvard2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html |title=Archive of: Remarks at NBER Conference on Diversifying the Science &amp; Engineering Workforce |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html |archivedate=January 30, 2008 |df= }}. January 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Google engineer, James Damore, wrote a memo entitled [[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber]] suggesting that differences in trait distributions between men and women was a reason for gender imbalance in STEM. The memo stated that [[affirmative action]] to reduce the gap could discriminate against highly qualified male candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evzjww/here-are-the-citations-for-the-anti-diversity-manifesto-circulating-at-google |title=Here Are the Citations for the Anti-Diversity Manifesto Circulating at Google |last1=Matsakis |first1=Louise | last2=Koebler |first2=Jason | last3=Emerson |first3=Sarah  |date=7 Aug 2017 |website= |publisher=Vice |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damore was fired for sending out this memo.

== Strategies for increasing representation of women ==
[[File:15208-event-CMS Girls Engineering Camp-6655 (18682448435).jpg|thumb|The CMS Girls Engineering Camp at [[Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce]] in June 2015]]

There are a multitude of factors that may explain the low representation of women in STEM careers. [[Anne-Marie Slaughter]], the first woman to hold the position of Director of Policy Planning for the [[United States Department of State]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.princeton.edu/slaughter | title=Anne-Marie Slaughter  |website=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; has recently suggested some strategies to the corporate and political environment to support women to fulfill to the best of their abilities the many roles and responsibilities that they undertake.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/letters/article/1225099--finding-a-work-life-balance Finding a work-life-balance], ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 11 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The academic and research environment for women may benefit by applying some of the suggestions she has made to help women excel, while maintaining a work-life balance.

===Social-psychological interventions===
A number of researchers have tested interventions to alleviate stereotype threat for women in situations where their math and science skills are being evaluated. The hope is that by combating stereotype threat, these interventions will boost women's performance, encouraging a greater number of them to persist in STEM careers.

One simple intervention is simply educating individuals about the existence of stereotype threat. Researchers found that women who were taught about stereotype threat and how it could negatively impact women's performance in math performed as well as men on a math test, even when stereotype threat was induced. These women also performed better than women who were not taught about stereotype threat before they took the math test.&lt;ref name=Johns2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johns|first1=Michael|last2=Schmader|first2=Toni|last3= Martens|first3= Andy|title=Knowing Is Half the Battle: Teaching Stereotype Threat as a Means of Improving Women's Math Performance|journal=Psychological Science|year=2005|volume=16|issue=3|pages=175–179|doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00799.x|pmid=15733195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Role models====
One of the proposed methods for alleviating stereotype threat is through introducing role models. One study found that women who took a math test that was administered by a female experimenter did not suffer a drop in performance when compared to women whose test was administered by a male experimenter.&lt;ref name=Marx2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marx|first1=D.M.|last2=Roman|first2=J.S.|title=Female role models: Protecting women's math performance|journal=Personality and Social Bulletin|year=2002|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1183–1193|doi=10.1177/01461672022812004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these researchers found that it was not the physical presence of the female experimenter but rather learning about her apparent competence in math that buffered participants against stereotype threat.&lt;ref name=Marx2002 /&gt; 
The findings of another study suggest that role models do not necessarily have to be individuals with authority or high status, but can also be drawn from peer groups. This study found that girls in same-gender groups performed better on a task that measured math skills than girls in mixed-gender groups.&lt;ref name=Huguet2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huguet|first1=P.|last2=Regner|first2=I.|title=Stereotype threat among schoolgirls in quasi-ordinary classroom circumstances|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=2007|volume=99|issue=3|pages=545–560|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.99.3.545}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the fact that girls in the same-gender groups had greater access to positive role models, in the form of their female classmates who excelled in math, than girls in mixed-gender groups.&lt;ref name=Huguet2007 /&gt; 
Similarly, another experiment showed that making groups achievements salient helped buffer women against stereotype threat. Female participants who read about successful women, even though these successes were not directly related to performance in math, performed better on a subsequent math test than participants who read about successful corporations rather than successful women.&lt;ref name=McIntyre2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIntyre|first1=R.B.|last2=Paulson|first2=R.M.|last3= Lord|first3= C.G.|title=Alleviating women's mathematics stereotype threat through salience of group achievements|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=39|issue=1|pages=83–90|doi=10.1016/s0022-1031(02)00513-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A study investigating the role of textbook images on science performance found that women demonstrated better comprehension of a passage from a chemistry lesson when the text was accompanied by a counter-stereotypic image (i.e., of a female scientist) than when the text was accompanied by a stereotypic image (i.e., of a male scientist).&lt;ref name=Good2010 /&gt;
Other scholars distinguish between the challenges of both recruitment and retention in increasing women's participation in STEM fields. These researchers suggest that although both female and male role models can be effective in recruiting women to STEM fields, female role models are more effective at promoting the retention of women in these fields.&lt;ref name=Drury2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drury|first1=Benjamin J.|last2=Siy|first2=John Oliver|last3= Cheryan|first3= Sapna|title=When Do Female Role Models Benefit Women? The Importance of Differentiating Recruitment From Retention in STEM|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=2011|volume=22|issue=4|pages=265–269|doi=10.1080/1047840x.2011.620935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female teachers can also act as role models for young girls. Reports have shown that the presence of female teachers positively influences girls' perceptions of STEM and increases their interest in STEM careers.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stearns|first=Elizabeth|last2=Bottía|first2=Martha Cecilia|last3=Davalos|first3=Eleonora|last4=Mickelson|first4=Roslyn Arlin|last5=Moller|first5=Stephanie|last6=Valentino|first6=Lauren|date=2016-02-01|title=Demographic Characteristics of High School Math and Science Teachers and Girls' Success in STEM|url=https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/63/1/87/1845557|journal=Social Problems|language=en|volume=63|issue=1|pages=87–110|doi=10.1093/socpro/spv027|issn=0037-7791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-affirmation====
Researchers have investigated the usefulness of self-affirmation in alleviating stereotype threat. One study found that women who affirmed a personal value prior to experiencing stereotype threat performed as well on a math test as men and as women who did not experience stereotype threat.&lt;ref name=Martens2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martens|first1=A.|last2=Johns|first2=M.|last3= Greenberg|first3= J.|last4=Schimel|first4=J.|title=Combating stereotype threat: The effect of self-affirmation on women's intellectual performance|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|issue=2|pages=236–243|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.04.010|hdl=10092/507}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study found that a short writing exercise in which college students, who were enrolled in an introductory physics course, wrote about their most important values substantially decreased the gender performance gap and boosted women's grades.&lt;ref name=Miyake2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miyake|first1=A.|last2=Kost-Smith|first2=L.E.|last3= Finkelstein|first3= N.D.|last4=Pollock|first4=S.J.|last5=Cohen|first5=G.L.|last6=Ito|first6=T.A.|title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation|journal=Science|year=2010|volume=330|issue=6008|pages=1234–1237|doi=10.1126/science.1195996|pmid=21109670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars believe that the effectiveness of such values-affirmation exercises is their ability to help individuals view themselves as complex individuals, rather than through the lens of a harmful stereotype. Supporting this hypothesis, another study found that women who were encouraged to draw self-concept maps with many nodes did not experience a performance decrease on a math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gresky|first1=D.M.|last2=Eyck|first2=L.L.T.|last3= Lord|first3= C.G.|last4=McIntyre|first4=R.B.|title=Effects of salient multiple identities on women's performance under mathematics stereotype threat|journal=Sex Roles|year=2005|volume=53|issue=9–10|pages=703–716|doi=10.1007/s11199-005-7735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women who did not draw self-concept maps or only drew maps with a few nodes did perform significantly worse than men on the math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005 /&gt; The effect of these maps with many nodes was to remind women of their "multiple roles and identities," that were unrelated to, and would thus not be harmed by, their performance on the math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005 /&gt;

=== Organized efforts ===
Organizations such as [[Girls Who Code]], StemBox,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2218287/stembox-girls-in-stem/|title=Introducing StemBox, Birchbox's Super Smart Little Sister|access-date=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blossom, Engineer Girl, [http://womanity.org/programs/afghanistan/ Girls Can Code] in Afghanistan, [http://robotixedu.com/indian-girls-code/ @IndianGirlsCode], and Kode with Klossy (spearheaded by supermodel [[Karlie Kloss]]) aim to encourage women and girls to explore male-dominated STEM fields. Many of these organizations offer summer programs and scholarships to girls interested in STEM fields. The U.S. government has funded similar endeavors; the Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs created TechGirls and TechWomen, exchange programs which teach Middle Eastern and North African girls and women skills valuable in STEM fields and encourage them to pursue STEM careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/03/205866.htm|title=Advancing the Status of Women and Girls Around the World|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [https://unesco.usmission.gov/teachher/ TeachHer Initiative], spearheaded by UNESCO, Costa Rican First Lady, [[Mercedes Peñas Domingo]], and [[Dr. Jill Biden]] which aims to close the gender gap in STEAM curricula and careers. The Initiative also emphasizes the importance of after school activities and clubs for girls.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;

'''''Zero Punctuation''''' is a [[Web series|series]] of video game reviews created by English comedy writer and [[Video game journalism|video game journalist]] [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]]. Since the series began in 2007, over 500 episodes have been created, which have been published weekly by internet magazine ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''. Episodes typically range from 5 to 6 minutes in length. Videos provide [[caustic humour]], rapid-fire delivery, [[visual gag]]s and critical insight into recently released video games, with occasional reviews of older games.

== History ==
Prior to Zero Punctuation, Croshaw primarily authored content for his blog, ''Fully Ramblomatic'', and would occasionally review video games, often with an emphasis on humor and criticism.&lt;ref name="fullyramblomatic-reviews"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/reviews/ |title=Reviews on FullyRamblomatic |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |year=2008 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, Croshaw uploaded two game reviews in video format to [[YouTube]] in the same style that would eventually be used for Zero Punctuation: one of the [[Game demo|demo]] of ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'' for the [[PlayStation 3]], and the other of ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable: The Lost Chapters]]'' for the [[Personal computer|PC]]. Both were well-received and ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' was one of several publishers to offer Croshaw a contract.&lt;ref name="gamespotinterview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6235040/pressspotting-ramblin-with-ben-yahtzee-croshaw |title=PressSpotting: Ramblin' with Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw |first=Kyle |last=Orland |date=March 22, 2008 |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Zero Punctuation" refers to the speed of Croshaw's narration. Since its creation, the series has become popular in the gaming community.&lt;ref name="gamespotinterview" /&gt; Video game developers and publishers have occasionally acknowledged Croshaw's reviews of their games, and at least one [[internet meme]] has resulted from Zero Punctuation.&lt;ref name="kotakumeme"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5307391/infamous-defeats-prototype-in-cross+dressing-playoff |title=inFamous Defeats Prototype in Cross-Dressing Playoff |first=Owen |last=Good |date=July 4, 2009 |work=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgamerinterview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2010/08/05/community-heroes-yahtzee-of-zero-punctuation/ |title=Community heroes: Yahtzee, for Zero Punctuation |first=Tom |last=Francis |date=August 5, 2010 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of every year, Croshaw creates special episodes of Zero Punctuation discussing what he believes were the best and worst games of the year; a practice that started at the end of 2008. He has occasionally dedicated episodes to new technologies or milestones in video gaming rather than games, such as [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] and the coming of the [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation of consoles]].&lt;ref name="zpkinect"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/4863-Kinect |title=Zero Punctuation - Kinect |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=October 26, 2011 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/7417-Next-Gen-Buyers-Guide |title=Zero Punctuation - Next Gen Buyer's Guide |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=June 5, 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2014, Yahtzee has released a sub-series of Zero Punctuation, titled "Zero Punctuation’s occasional guide to &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through;"&gt;retarded&lt;/span&gt; special moments in gaming history", where he looks back upon events or periods in gaming that garnered widespread, often infamous, attention; these include the video game ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which helped contribute to the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game industry crash of 1983]], and the controversial ''[[Hot Coffee mod|Hot Coffee]]'' mod for ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E.T. - "The Worst Game Ever"|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/9625-E-T-The-Worst-Game-Ever|website=The Escapist|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Coffee|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/117180-Zero-Punctuation-hot-coffee|website=The Escapist|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2009, Croshaw has also been writing a column on The Escapist known as ''Extra Punctuation''. These articles were originally published every Tuesday and often supplement the previous week's review by discussing a certain topic or trend exhibited by that game. However, after several years writing the column on a weekly basis, Croshaw began to produce entries less frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation|title=Extra Punctuation|publisher=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Zero Punctuation, Croshaw usually reviews a game or games in a highly critical manner using rapid-fire speech delivery accompanied by minimalistic cartoon imagery and animation on a distinctive yellow background, which illustrates what is being said or provides an [[irony|ironic]] counterpoint to it. Subtle references or jokes may be inserted to the visuals for comic effect or to add additional context to the narration. His reviews are intended to be humorous with constant usage of puns, analogies, metaphors, and [[Black comedy|dark humour]] accompanied by liberal use of [[profanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/interview-zero-punctuations-ben-yahtzee-croshaw-reveals-all/|title=Interview: Zero Punctuation's Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw reveals all|first=Nate|last=Lanxon|date=November 4, 2009|website=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/03/05/zero-punctuation-yahtzee-crys-about-dmc4/|title=Zero Punctuation: Yahtzee cries about DMC4|first=Terrence|last=StasseMarch 5, 2008|website=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-oDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|title=Zero Punctuation Review Terrorizes EA Game Development|magazine=[[GameAxis Unwired]]|date=April 2008|issue=55|issn=0219-872X|publisher=[[SPH Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croshaw usually substitutes the main character or himself with his own [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]], a cartoon man distinguished by a [[trilby]]. Another character used often is an [[imp]]-like creature (originally meant to resemble a "darkling" from ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'') which represents antagonists, animals, or less important characters from a video game. Video games, developers, countries, and other entities are often [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] as box arts, logos, or flags with arms and legs when they are being addressed directly, or when an action by that entity is being explained.

Zero Punctuation opens and closes with a [[Theme music|theme song]], a rock track composed and performed by Ian Dorsch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/content/music |title=The Escapist : Sound and Music |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ending credits usually feature humorous notes or other information relating to the review, as well as imagery of characters from the review engaging in [[slapstick]], however in 2014, the videos posted on YouTube omit the credit sequences. Prior to mid-2008, Zero Punctuation featured commercial songs at the beginning and end of each episode, which were usually related to the context of, or at odds with the game in question, such as [[Ramones|The Ramones]]' "[[I Wanna Be Sedated]]" and [[Eric Johnson]]'s "[[Cliffs of Dover (composition)|Cliffs of Dover]]" at the beginning and end, respectively, of his review of ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''.

The series' format has proved inspirational for several other web series, such as the critical and educational series [[Extra Credits]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Floyd|first=Daniel|title=Video Games and Storytelling|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jdG2LHair0|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CGP Grey]].&lt;ref name="H.I. #13: Nobody Owns the Facts"&gt;{{cite podcast|last2=Grey|first2=CGP|last1=Haran|first1=Brady|title=Nobody Owns the Facts|url=http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/13|work=Hello Internet|number=13|publisher=Hellointernet.fm|accessdate=2014-06-17|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=https://www.relay.fm/cortex/10 |title=Cortex #10: Zero Artistic Skills |website=Cortex |publisher=Relay FM |host=Grey, C.

==Critical style==
Croshaw, more often than not, provides highly critical reviews of games, usually pointing out the faults that he implies other professional reviewers ignore in high-profile releases.&lt;ref name="pcgamerinterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mailbag"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/37-Mailbag-Showdown |title=Zero Punctuation - Mailbag Showdown |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=May 7, 2008 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tends to disdain certain overused tropes and conventions in video games, such as [[quick time event]]s, highly common uses of [[Motion controller|motion controls]], [[cover system|cover-based shooting]] and unbalanced emphasis on [[Video game graphics|graphics]] over story or [[gameplay]].&lt;ref name="zpkinect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zpuncharted"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/27-Uncharted-Drakes-Fortune |title = ZeroPunctuation - Uncharted: Drake's Fortune |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=February 27, 2008 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zptlou"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/7638-The-Last-of-Us |title=Zero Punctuation - The Last of Us |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=July 3, 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also disapproves of game franchises that release sequels in rapid succession, such as ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'', and ''[[Call of Duty]]''.&lt;ref name="zptop5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/8642-Top-5-Games-of-2013 |title=Zero Punctuation - Top 5 Games of 2013 |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=January 1, 2014 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croshaw generally does not review certain genres of games, and has openly admitted to not liking most [[Japanese role-playing game|JRPG]]s, [[real-time strategy]] games, [[fighting game]]s, or [[Simulation video game|simulation games]]. More recently{{When|date=August 2018}}, he has begun disliking military-themed [[first-person shooter]]s such as ''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[Medal of Honor (video game series)|Medal of Honor]]'', and ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'' for being what he believes to be extremely similar in gameplay, poor in ethics, and contrived in story, while using the moniker "spunkgargleweewee" to differentiate them from other styles of first-person shooter game.&lt;ref name="zp2012"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/6677-Top-5-of-2012 |title=Zero Punctuation - Top 5 of 2012 |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=January 2, 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/2486-Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops |title=Zero Punctuation - Call of Duty: Black Ops |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=September 5, 2007 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Croshaw|first1=Ben|date=November 7, 2012|title=Zero Punctuation - Medal of Honor Warfighter &amp; Doom 3 BFG Edition|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/6492-Medal-of-Honor-Warfighter-Doom-3-BFG-Edition|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often criticizes publishers or developers with practices that he believes are in some way damaging to [[video games industry]] or otherwise unacceptable, such as [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="destructoid"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-interview-ben-yahtzee-croshaw-69631.phtml |title=Destructoid interview: Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw |date=February 11, 2008 |work=[[Destructoid]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Zero Punctuation episodes are usually intended to highlight Croshaw's criticisms of video games, his general opinions are not universally negative, and any positive feelings towards the aspects of a game will usually be explicitly stated.&lt;ref name="destructoid" /&gt; A number of video games have received favorable ''Zero Punctuation'' reviews, which include some of his all-time favorite games such as ''[[Silent Hill 2]]'', ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', and ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reddit AMAA |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/glt5k/iam_yahtzee_croshaw_off_of_the_escapists_zero/c1ojct7 |title=IAM Yahtzee Croshaw off of the Escapist's Zero Punctuation, AMAA |publisher=[[Reddit.com]] |date= |accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation - Silent Hill 2|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/878-Silent-Hill-2|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation - Prince of Persia Retrospective|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/183-Prince-of-Persia-Retrospective|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation - Shadow of the Colossus|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/1924-Shadow-of-the-Colossus|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croshaw had no criticisms for another favorite, the video game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Puncation - The Orange Box|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/10-The-Orange-Box|website=The Escapist|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although by the time ''[[Portal 2 (video game)|Portal 2]]'' was released approximately 4 years later, he stated that the only flaw of the first ''Portal'' was its fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Puncation - Portal 2|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/3153-Portal-2|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opened his review of ''[[BioShock]]'' by saying "nobody likes it when I'm being nice to a game," referring to the negative reception of his favorable review of ''[[Psychonauts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/4-BioShock |title=Zero Punctuation - BioShock |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=November 24, 2010 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croshaw cites the work of British television critic and PC Zone journalist [[Charlie Brooker]] as the "main inspiration" for his own reviewing style, as well as the writings of [[Douglas Adams]], Sean "[[Seanbaby]]" Riley, [[Victor Lewis-Smith]], and [[Old Man Murray]]'s [[Chet Faliszek]] and [[Erik Wolpaw]].&lt;ref name="destructoid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/games/interview-zero-punctuations-yahtzee-572875/ |title=Interview: Zero Punctuation’s Yahtzee |first=James |last=Schneider |date=February 14, 2008 |work=[[Geek.com]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/videos/zeropunctuation/2655-Yahtzee-Visits-Valve-a-Travelogue.2 |title=Yahtzee Visits Valve, a Travelogue |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=November 21, 2007 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed respect towards the late [[Roger Ebert]], noting that he "might one day aspire to being his videogaming equivalent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/7473-Videogames-as-Art |title=Extra Punctuation - Videogames as Art |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=April 27, 2010 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games of the Year==
At the end of each year since 2008, Croshaw has created episodes of Zero Punctuation showcasing his favorite and most disliked games reviewed in that year. These episodes systematically alternate between his selections for the five best and five worst of the year in ascending order. In 2008 and 2009, however, these were done in a mock awards format. In 2015, he added a new category concerning the blandest and least innovative games of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFGU79rX34 |title=Top 5 Games of 2015 (Zero Punctuation) |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=January 13, 2016 |work=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2013 lists, he also awarded the "Lifetime Achievement Award for Total Abhorrence" to ''[[Ride to Hell: Retribution]]'', expressing that it was so poor in quality that he hardly considered it a game but rather saw it as "congealed failure". He also stated that the game would indefinitely hold the award until a worse game came along, which he claims "should roughly be around the time [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|apes have retaken the earth.]]"&lt;ref name="zptop5" /&gt;

In 2015 he created a category where he gave his top five blandest games of 2015, which he felt had not added anything new or fresh to the franchise they were a part of. He rated [[Halo 5: Guardians]] as the year's blandest game. [[Undertale]] was awarded his Game of the Year but which had not been given its own Zero Punctuation episode beforehand. Having stated before the awards began that all games mentioned must have already been reviewed by him, he promptly gave his own last-minute opinion by merely stating "Undertale is a good game".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Zero Punctuation : Top 5 Games of 2015|url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/116617-Top-5-Best-and-Worst-Games-of-2015|website = The Escapist|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Zero Punctuation has received generally positive reviews, with much of the praise centered towards Yahtzee's sharp wit and style of comedic writing. As of October 2018, the series has an IMDB rating of 7.7 from 409 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation (2007-)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2793136/|website=IMDB|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boing Boing]] called the series "hilariously cutting ... first legitimate breakout hit from the gaming community in recent memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
